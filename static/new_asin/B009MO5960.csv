5351588,2,B009MO5960,"You know what would have made this movie better? If it had been a game. Seriously, I could've played this game. As a movie, it was kind of boring. They waste about the first 15 minutes explaining what has happened in the past four movies. REALLY?! You think people are going to show up that DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?!!!! Give the audience some credit.

For me, that's saying A LOT. I have been in love with Resident Evil since this first time I played #1 on my playstation. The game was as groundbreaking for zombies as Silent Hill was for demon-worshipers.

There's lots of Mila-is-such-a-badass shots, fighting, slow motion, etc. (I later found out the director is her husband. It explains much) There's a bunch of Michelle-is-so-mean-and-uncaring dialogue, fighting, etc. You'll get to see a lot of previous characters die again. Sometimes twice. The Red Queen will give away all the surprises through out the movie. Wesker returns for more wax-like acting and bad-guy posturing. (was he CGI? Cause he looked very CGI)

Honestly, they should have saved this part as a game, released it, then continued the movie where the game leaves off. THAT would have been awesome, and pulled the audience right in. (well, us gamers anyway.)

Where the very first Resident Evil movie succeeded enormously, quite a feat when the audience already know what was going on, the last four have steadily lowered the bar over-and-over. Time to shoot this franchise in the head.",1348012800,,1461,4.879032258064516
5351589,2,B009MO5960,"""Resident Evil: Retribution"" has a pretty decent opening. You see the final battle of the last movie and its aftermath play backwards and in slow-motion as the opening credits roll. There's no dialogue and it's very straightforward. It makes you wish the entire movie was done this way since it would be a lot more enjoyable. Alice eventually narrates a recap of the first four movies and then you see that same battle play forwards and in real time. It's a bit redundant and feels twice as long as it is.

The action seems to be slightly better than it was in ""Afterlife,"" but the slow-motion is as pointless as ever and the fight sequences become more and more repetitive the longer they are. The longest fight sequence is in this extended hallway where Alice fights a horde of zombies with a gun and a chain. There's some cool choreography in it, but it quickly becomes stale as Alice does the same flip kick move at least three or four times in the span of two minutes. There are a few interesting perspective shots like when you're right behind a zombie as Alice blows their brains out and the splatter goes all over the camera. The 3D still isn't fully utilized though and isn't worth the extra money for the handful of shots that actually try to use the effect.

What makes matters worse is that the acting is still so stiff and rigid. Sienna Guillory kind of ruins things for everybody as her line delivery is pretty terrible. Everyone has a lack of facial expressions or emotions though. During an outbreak of this caliber where the world has nearly ended, shoving your emotions aside for a certain period of time is understandable. There are bigger tasks at hand, but there's bound to be some sort of psychological and emotional damage along the way especially five movies in.

Alice alone has gone through so much with the loss of so many friends and loved ones, having and not having superhuman abilities, and being cloned to serve Umbrella's needs. If you went through this, wouldn't you have a moment where you finally broke down once you were alone or tried to sleep or whatever since it's obviously a lot to put on one person's shoulders? Nobody ever has that revelation. Every character is so busy trying to look like a bad ass and looking dramatically at the camera in slow motion to make time for anything resembling human emotion.

""Resident Evil: Retribution"" does feel like a miniscule improvement over ""Afterlife,"" but should still be considered overkill for a franchise that has already run its course. What's the point of cloning Alice's closest friends if they're just going to suffer the same fate in similar fashion? On one hand, it's kind of a throwback to the movies that came before it. But on the other hand, the logical one, it just seems really stupid overall.

For some reason, people are still excited about this franchise as ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" was the number one movie in the country its opening weekend. Despite being the second movie of the franchise to be shot in 3D, the 3D effects are underwhelming while most of the special effects are done in front of a green screen and stand out like a sore thumb (or a green one). With its poor acting, unnecessary use of slow motion, repetitive fight scenes, and a story structure that's been exactly the same since the first movie, there's no telling why so many people love this franchise unless people are just a sucker for seeing Milla Jovovich dressed in leather and kicking the crap out of the undead.",1347840000,2,3498,4.66288492706645
5351590,2,B009MO5960,As a fan of the RE movies and Anderson I hate to say that this one stinks.  I also hated his last film The Three Musketeers.  I've grown tired of the Flash and no substance film making.  Is this Resident Evil or the Matrix?  This film is a mess and it lost me from the very start.  Milla looks great as always but the action is way over the top.  Actors look pretty while standing in the open firing their weapons.  Trust me as a fan that this is the worst of the bunch.  Sad to say this won't be the last.,1347753600,,506,3.892156862745098
5351591,4,B009MO5960,"I am a fan of the RE series, and much like the Underworld franchise, these are more fun and enjoyable than great pieces of cinema. The CGI and action scenes are the best of the five movies and this is a huge step up from Afterlife, though the plot and dialogue can be just as weak at times.

Milla Jovovich is back at what she does best (and looks good doing it) and so are a bunch of characters from previous installments. The actor who played Leon couldn't act worth a darn, but everyone else did okay.

I loved the reverse slow motion opening credits, complete with some nice music. The fight scenes with Alice and the chain in the white hallway and the finale with her against Jill Valentine were the highlights for me. The ending was pretty epic, setting up what looks to be the last entry in this action packed series.

The IMAX 3-D was good. Not really worth double price, but it added more than it took away.",1347753600,4,916,4.313953488372093
5351592,1,B009MO5960,"I am a hardcore fan of the R.E. games, but this franchise is taking a skydive in the movie sector.  This latest movie was just flat out bad.  they keep repeating the same formula from the last few movies to exhaustion. (slow motion blood splatter, boss monsters, and that lame annoying albert wesker character)  this is the 5th entry to the franchise i think and the story goes no where, same platform, same incomplete ending that leaves it open for yet another movie ...enough already it's  really getting sad.",1347667200,2,511,4.707865168539326
5351593,1,B009MO5960,"Milla Jovovich returns to the franchise. This is the worst one thus far. Theme is the same: zombies, infection, and virus. The story-line is Terrible! There were High-Expectations for this film, but a huge let-down. Many folks discussed it after the movie ended, and most were upset that that this one was Missing a lot. I give it 1 Star for Action & Fighting, because that's all it was, without a story. A huge disappointment from fans of the heralded series. Some viewers told me that they were so bored, they fell asleep. This one is simply not worth the money for your movie ticket!",1347580800,3,586,4.59047619047619

The fight sequences were great, of course Alice does some mega moves on her enemies but shes Alice. :) It keeps your attention from start to finish. I did not see in 3D none the less I was 110% satisfied. I pressume 3D effects would have made it 100x better.",1347580800,19,380,4.442857142857143
5351595,5,B009MO5960,"Resident Evil Retribution 3D Review: Even better 3D than RE: Afterlife

Resident Evil doesn't cater to non-action fans, and Resident Evil Retribution proves this point with it's non-stop action onslaught from the opening credits to the ending.

STEREO 3D:
The 3D in Resident Evil Retribution delivers in spades, being filmed in three dimensions with on the set 3D camera rigs, we get a consistency of powerfully layered visuals, with clear stereo 3D distance between the objects onscreen. There are also plenty of pop outs to flinch away from as bullets and blades fly out of the screen to great effect. This is one of the best 3D movies you can get as Anderson shows he's not only a master of action movies, but stereo 3D scene composition. So if you're looking for another demo worthy 3D disc, look no further than Resident Evil Retribution, boosting the 3D up even more than Resident Evil Afterlife 3D. Exceptional 3D.

STORY:
This movie plays with your head sort of like Inception did, never letting you really know what's going on till about midway when Alice is finally let in on the reality of the situation. A bit jarring at first, but very unique for a RE Film. That aside, the story is fairly basic, from point A to B with some side stories thrown in for good measure. Finally, this fifth RE movie does a nice job paying tribute to the previous RE films in many ways as you'll see.

ACTION:
If you know the Resident Evil series, you'll know there's usually a heavy emphasis on full on action. Retribution lives up to the term ""Roller Coaster"" by providing nearly non-stop action, literally. Just when Alice (Milla Jovovich) finishes on action scene, another enemy shows up and attacks, leaving little room for story development in between. So think of it as a total @ss kicking action movie made for your entertainment along the lines of The Expendables 2 and you'll enjoy it.

The action sequences are incredible in terms of martial arts choreography (especially the opening attack on Alice in the white halls = amazing mix of roundhouse kicks, flipping, tossing, locking, cracking heads, chain flicking and shooting).
Then there's guns blazing every few seconds, Zombie attacks in the Suburbs, Las Plagas ""Smart shooting zombies from the RE 4 game"" confrontations in Moscow, fast speed car chases, stalking Licker monsters, giant butcher Axe Men attacks in the city, and an ending arctic fight scene that goes on for a glorious five minutes at least. All done with explosions, special FX and splattering blood better than before. Incredible action.

ACTING:
Milla Jovovich (Aice) and a number of returning members including Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) deliver their lines with a relaxed believability that comes off as genuine. The roles of Ada Wong and Jill Valentine however, are a bit robotic, perhaps intentionally but still mildly distracting, as they were/are under the control of Umbrella. Leon makes an appearance, but again, some of the delivery of his lines could have been more natural. Otherwise, well done.

SOUNDTRACK: TomandAndy return from Resident Evil Afterlife and compose another great industrial electronic film score that rocks and beats along with the action. Excellent and worth a purchase for the soundtrack again.

SUMMARY:
If you're a Resident Evil Fan of any of the films, this is highly recommended. One of most visceral, guns blazing action movies I've ever seen, despite the basic plot. Paul WS Anderson keeps getting better at delivering stylized, action packed movies.

MOVIE: 9/10 Wow. Incredible example of an all out action movie.
STORY: 7/10 Very basic Point A to B with some side stories added
ACTION: 10/10. Amazing and beautifully composed. Movie is 80% slick action.
SPECIAL FX: 9/10. Great monsters, explosions, fx, but zombies are mostly fresh.
STEREO 3D: 9/10. It doesn't get much better. Most shots shine for 3D.

OVERALL: 9/10. If you love action and powerful 3D, don't pass it up.",1347580800,41,3937,4.97869101978691

After freeing thousands of survivors from an Umbrella Corporation ship Alice and company are attacked by Umbrella forces and oops, the survivors are all killed.  Easy come, easy go.  Alice wakes up in (yet another!) underground lab and (once more!) escapes.  This time she fights her way through a 'greatest hits' version of the last few movies - simulations of places like New York, Tokyo and Raccoon City.  She carries two very cool looking SMGs that somehow unerringly hit their targets even without sights or any effort at aiming!  Useful!  In the process she picks up a deaf little girl, a ham-fisted way of humanizing Alice and raising the stakes.

The story is definitely lacking, but the action and seeing favorite characters returning make up for it (Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine is awesome!). It does have a lot of plot holes, such as what happens to Claire and Chris Redfield (and K-Mart, whoever that is from Extinction). The sad part is none of these characters are returning for the final movie scheduled to release on January 27, 2016.

5351954,4,B009MO5960,"This is the penultimate resident evil movie, picking up immediately after the events of Afterlife, and shows the attack on the ship which is led (as teased in the Afterlife credits sequence) by Jill Valentine, played by the returning Sienna Guillory.  From there, the film takes place in another Umbrella facility (underwater this time), and trying to escape, evade and destroy at the same time.  The film sees a few cast additions, most notably the character of Ada Wong, played by Li Bingbing.  It also sees the return of several characters from the prior films, including  Colin Salmon who played One,  Michelle Rodriguez who played Rain Ocampo in the first film as well as  Oded Fehr who portrayed Carlos Olivera in the second and third films.  I will not spoil how their characters come back, although most can likely figure it out.  Boris Kodjoe also returns in the role of Luther West, having survived the events of Afterlife.  Although the fates of the Redfield's are left up in the air, as neither Ali Larter nor Wentworth Miller returned for this movie.

The film is much like the others have been.  The zombies are getting more powerful, and there are threats beyond just the zombies that are revealed.  This film is basically the set up for what will be the final film in the second trilogy, and ultimately the story.  If you have liked what has come before, then you will like this movie.  If you have not liked the movies or the games then you will definitely not like this.  For extras for those who get the blu rays, they are much the same as what have been on the other films.  Deleted scenes, a gag reel, several behind the scenes and making of featurettes and a couple commentary tracks.  Milla Jovovich and Boris Kodje join Anderson on commentary on one of the tracks, and Milla is very funny as she has been on the others she has done.  She takes the work and the character seriously, but does not take herself too seriously and you can tell she just has fun with it all.",1461542400,,1992,4.563380281690141

5352080,1,B009MO5960,"Can't really comment on the movie since I haven't seen it. This review is for the actual product I received. Or rather...didn't receive.

I bought all of the resident evil DVD's around Valentine's Day 2015 thinking we'd sit down and have a movie marathon. Life got in the way, and we didn't get to it until today. Because it was both a NEW purchase, and an actual AMAZON purchase, and not a 3rd party, we didn't think we needed to open the original plastic seal on the case. We put the cases on the DVD shelf and left them there.

Today we finally sat down to have that marathon, and when we get to the last movie about 20 minutes ago, he takes the plastic off, opens the case and asks if I'm playing a joke. Then he shows me the case. EMPTY.

There was nothing inside except an expired coupon code from 2014 for the UltraViolet copy of the movie.

No DVD.

I can't file a complaint because according to this site, the window ran out at the end of March 2015.

I have all the Resident Evil movies in this franchise and, that includes the 2 animated movies as well.
Like another reviewer has asked: ""why do people hate theses movies so much?"" If your expecting something along the lines of Bergman's The Seventh Seal... you won't find that here!
These movies are pure action and thriller entertainment so, no thinking is allowed. So, leave you brain cells at the door when viewing this movie or, any of the other movies in this series.
This movie (like all the Resident Evil movies) is very, very, well done for the escapism entertainment that they are. So, just pop a couple of chill pills and enjoy the move.",1432944000,2,706,4.566929133858268

5352216,1,B009MO5960,"I loved this first four RE films with a passion. When I first heard Leon S. Kennedy was going to be in Retribution, I was beyond thrilled. After the first 30 minutes of this movie, I was just no into it. They took away a lot of the story-telling they had with the others. This one was nowhere near as good as the previous four & they completely screwed up the character of Leon and Barry. They're not like the game versions at all, besides the clothing & gun choices, which was a huge letdown & a shock since the other characters in the franchise (Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Nemesis) were as close to the game version as possible. This is the worst movie of the five & seeing as how a sixth installment is inevitable, I hope they do better because I dunno how much worse it can get.

5352238,5,B009MO5960,"I am a fan of all the Resident Evil games as well as the previous movies. This movie delivered just what is needed and if someone says different, then they are not actual fans of this genre. I don't think you can enjoy a franchise if you are selective in what you like about it. The end result would, for the most part, be disappointing for you. The movie gives you exactly what you need in the elements of the games as well as the elements of an action film. People may find Alice weak in this movie, but I am trying to figure how one woman, through injuries and unique fighting skills as a human makes her weak. When it comes to storytelling, they did just how the games are done, players are given the back story and they have to learn how to survive throughout the game/movie. Just like the game, there are casualties. Just like the game, the scariest and annoying creatures are presented (In the game if you are not very skilled, those creatures are not easy to kill, which is annoying if you keep dying). For those who are not fans of the franchise whether it is the game or movie, this may not please you because it has the elements of a game and movie. So the things that takes place in the movie is something you may not identify with. One reason is how characters interact which one another, which is how they react in the games. It is not the same as in a regular action film. It may also seem long and boring (In the game it can get like that if you cannot figure out how to get from point A to B without dying) but in comparison to the game, you would be doing just what the movie implies; getting the heck out of there with a strategy in mind. I give it five stars because the movie is the best adaptation of a game franchise and Milla Jovovich is good at playing Alice. I can't wait until the next installment of the movie comes out. As a note I would say for the gamer's to go back if they can and play Resident evil 1 to 4 and you would understand. The movies are just a bonus and not an exact adaptation of the games but the essence of them.",1430006400,,2059,4.124378109452737

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

You have several different areas, Moscow, New York, suburbia, the sub pens, and a glacier.  Every time we cut to one of these areas, a little window pops up with the ""Red Queen"" character in there describing the area and saying what creatures will be released into that area to try and stop the intruders.  Then we get our heroes going into that area, a fight scene ensues and they escape to move to the next area.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

In the end we kill off our secondary characters and leave the main ones alive.  Poor Luther, I was really liking his character.  And in the end we find that the main bad guy from the last movie is alive and well.  He confronts Alice and gives her back her super powers that the T-Virus gave her and says they are on the same team because now the Red Queen wants to kill all humans.  And the movie ends with a sweeping view of their compound being attacked by legions of zombies.

I really don't know why I bother to keep torturing myself by watching these movies.  There is no great story to them, it's just throwing zombie stuff against the wall to see what sticks.

Except of coarse, most B movies have a viable premise and with higher production quality could have been something worth watching. My collection of this series has officially been stopped.

5352553,5,B009MO5960,I love the Resident Evil movies. They have a good story and plenty of action. Milla Jovovich is a great actress and she pulls this role off perfectly. 100% Recommend!!,1395360000,,167,4.6

5352555,2,B009MO5960,"Let me start off this review by saying that I've never been a huge fan of the Resident Evil films. I hated the first one, the second one was so bad it was fun to watch, the third film was decent, and the fourth I actually had a fun time with. The main reason I watch these films are because I am a huge fan of the games and I always thought the action sequences were actually well done in these films. With each film in the series getting a little better, I figured that I'd give Retribution a shot in hopes that it would be similar to Afterlife with over-the-top action and amazing 3D effects.

Fortunately, Resident Evil: Retribution is a step backwards in a franchise that was never that good to begin with and while it may not be the worst film in the franchise, it's easily the most pointless. First off, the tagline ""Evil Goes Global"" and trailers for the film are incredibly misleading. They presented the film as if it was going to be Alice and the rest of group traveling around the world fighting zombies and taking down Wesker. The film is actually about Alice and a team of survivors trying to escape an underwater located Umbrella Base while they go through simulations of locations around the world such as Tokyo and New York City. I couldn't help but feel ripped off by the end of the film as I expected something totally different and got something that just seemed rather lazy.

Before I go anymore further into the negative aspects of the film though, I do want to mention some positive things about it. The action sequences in the film are once again really well filmed. While Paul W.S Anderson may not know how to direct a film as a whole, he knows how to shoot action. The action sequences in the first act are excellent and the climax scene had me on the edge of my seat. While I would say the film is non-stop action, the middle section of the film consist of generic shoot-em up scenes that are just not that entertaining or fun to watch. As a result, the film ends up feeling dull from this point up until the climax. On another positive note, the film is well paced and moves super fast so we never feel too tortured by even the dullest of scenes. It also provides a video game like feel to the film which is always a nice touch. Speaking of the video games, I have to admit it was pretty cool to see Leon in the film as he is my favorite character in the games.

However, thats where the positives end for the most part. Back on the negative aspect, as I said before, there is almost no plot in the film and it's more of just a set up for a bunch of action sequences. I wouldn't have minded this as much if all of the action sequences were as equally entertaining instead of falling back on lame shoot-em-up scenes by the halfway point. I've also got to say that this film is incredibly stupid, and I mean stupid! I know that these are turn-your-brain-off action movies, but I just couldn't get over how incredibly stupid this movie was! Almost nothing made sense and the fact that Alice spends half of the movie trying to save a little girl that she finds in one of the simulations who serves no purpose what so ever and isn't even a real person. It was probably one of the worst plot devices I've ever seen in a movie and all the action sequences could've been set up just fine without her, in which would've resulted in a much less mind-numbingly stupid movie. Now I've never been into the story of this series, but the fact that this movie had none and did nothing to advance the progression of the already thin story in the previous films had me wishing they would've. While watching, it's hard to not feel as if Anderson and Jovovich have finally grown tired of this franchise (as they should've a long time ago). And while nobody goes into these films expecting good acting, it's worth mentioning that the acting here is by far the worst in the series. On a side note, one thing that also got me into the theater was the 3D effects. After Afterlife and it's amazing 3D, one would expect Retribution to at least be on par with it's 3D effects. Unfortunately, the 3D here is rather mediocre. It doesn't add much depth to the film at all and while there are plenty of gimmicky moments, none of them pop out like they should. This lackluster 3D effects are most likely a result of Anderson switching to using Red Epic Cameras (a cheaper brand of 3D technology) instead of the Fusion Camera System that was used for Afterlife. This was most likely done for budget reasons, but at the expense of the 3D technology for the film.

Even for fans of the franchise, Retribution is a hard film to recommend because it does nothing to advance the story that many of the fans enjoy and is nothing more than just 90 minutes of filler for a 6th film in the series. What saves it from being downright terrible are the action sequences. Judging by the ending, there's not doubt that a 6th film is on it's way. Lets just hope that the series ends there because Retribution is only more proof that this franchise should've have never gone as far as it has.",1395273600,,5070,4.3619047619047615

5352581,5,B009MO5960,"Uniquely to the Resident Evil franchise, this brilliant series of 5 live action movies and 2 CGI films, has remained loyal to the gamers first and foremost. This was the origin of the first RE movie. Unlike other heavy block-busters of the same genre, keeping the style of names, strengths and storyline true to the progression of all the video game fans was always in mind. While it may have bound the hands and directorial freedoms as each movie was produced, I and my fellow RE lovers, still were in attendance on each opening day, and first in line to watch Alice kick some ""Umbrella Corp."" Ass!

Being fully aware of the limitations that the ""games"" restricted the films to, didn't make me any less happier on those opening days! And every person on those lines were with the same anticipations I was.

Yet I read SO MANY ""reviewers"" here with words of loath. It boggles the mind to see how many of the 1 & 2 Star people BOUGHT this, and the other 4 RE flicks, but offer up the worst words? Did they not know what they were purchasing? Had they no idea where their dollars were being spent?

ALL of the actors and actresses, from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez and Sienna Guillory, to Li Bingbing and Johann Urb. Each one of these people were portraying a ""character"" from any of the ""games."" Which entails that they are nothing more than 1 or 2 dimensional. Hence the ""shallow acting"" as some have suggested. In their own right, they are fine and talented actors! BUT THIS IS A MOVIE DEPICTION OF A VIDEO GAME!

To that end, there is much credit to be given. Would these ""negative comments"" be said for the ""Lara Croft"" character from Tomb Raider or ""Selene"" of Underworld? Unfortunately for some actors, they can become typecast. Or, for those less able to see the difference, some movie-goer's cannot separate the role being portrayed and the background behind those roles.

Whichever the case may be, I challenge the 1 Star reviewer's to take another look at this fantastic franchise. There are definitive reasons why RE has lasted this long! Why RE has such a loyal fan base. It has molded careers for some extremely fortunately people. I and my son are enjoying watching every RE movie. Be it live action or the CGI. That means 2 generations in my family! I'm sure were are not alone! But, WE know the difference.

I won't bother reviewing Resident Evil: Retribution as it appears most have already done so. This is purely to face down those who seek to condemn a franchise work of art! If so many didn't like it in the first place, you should have let it be. If you went the next step and bought this, and continue the rant, well, it only looks good for Amazon! Fore it is Amazon who now has your money!

And I will see you at the theater when the next sequel of Resident Evil is released! I'm sure you will be there incognito!",1391817600,2,2843,4.50873786407767

5352588,2,B009MO5960,"With no end in sight director Paul W. S. Anderson and his partner/wife Milla Jovovich keep coming at us like the virus that infests the world they occupy in this series.  While this 5th edition is perhaps a modest improvement over number 4, that isn't a high hurdle to clear.

Even though I've seen all of the Resident Evil films, glutton for punishment I am, I'm still not sure what the hell is going on half the time.  What I do know is that my eyes and ears will be filled with color and flying bullets coming from all directions.  Alice (Jovovich) is the human who has somehow been able to adapt to the virus which makes her one tough lady.  She has no problem eliminating the zombie like creatures or human bad guys for that matter.  In the end all we know is that it isn't.  As long as Jovovich looks good in black leather, these films will keep on coming.

On a positive note, Anderson has done some cutting edge CGI and it comes across perfectly to the Blu ray transfer.  Available in 3D, I only watched the film in 2D and it looked spectacular.  The 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are dramatic and perfectly displayed.  Black levels are excellent and flesh tones perfect.  The video is demo grade stuff.  Likewise the audio is hard to beat.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is solid and transformative even for an action based movie like this.  Frankly some of the gunfights were a challenge for my AV receiver.  In several of the gun battles, you will feel centered as the action is all around.  The subs are fully engaged but not artificially so.  Again this is demo grade.  Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.  Here are the extras:

Well, let me tell you,I really enjoyed this one and for me the time just flew by. Is it on a scale of one like Into The Darkness , of course not but in my opinion ,it was the life of the party. The action just kept coming and some of the 3-D effects were just super.

5352634,5,B009MO5960,"Have you ever had the hots for a regular looking nurse just because she was wearing those fleshy nylons and those retarded orthopedic shoes with the thick soles? And, you just knew you had to have her, or you would be living a dream unfulfilled? If so, you just might be weird enough to fully appreciate this Trashy Actioner.

The first time I saw this I was a little disappointed, to say the least. But, I was in the wrong mood. My bad. The second time I saw this, I had been up all night, and in the morning, I was dizzy with mental fatigue. I was in a somnambulistic trance. That fearful drooling vegetative state when you finally realize you've pretty much wasted your entire life in front of the idiot box and you've accomplished absolutely nothing of any value whatsoever. While the credits were rolling, sitting naked in my boxer briefs covered in Cheetos' dust & chocolate milk, the potato glaze of insomnia had finally wore off of me. Everything in my sedentary life was going as I had planned, but I knew that I needed to make a serious reassessment of this flick.

PLOT: Something about the Umbrella Corporation making the t-virus available to all the NWO powers, touching off a brand new arms race. A sort of bio-arms race, if you will. Then of course, the whole world mutates and humanity gets eaten, leaving very few survivors. I'm not kidding! The Red Queen goes homicidal once again in an underwater Russian Hive that clones clones clones, and clones more t-virus warriors in a sort of Disneyland gone mad ""It's a Small World"" battle simulator. Into this mess steps Albert Wesker, Alice, and all the rest of the characters from the RE video game universe. It's like an RE high school reunion. Only with clones. They're the only hope for humanity. And they're armed to the teeth! Seriously! To all you science deniers: this is not a question of IF THIS WILL HAPPEN?... but WHEN!

CLONES: Did I mention clones? There are so many clones, it makes George Lucas' Attack of The Clones look like... like... not that many clones. The Michelle Rodrigruez clone gets killed so many times I think I lost count.

WEAPONS: Guns. Lots of guns. Machine guns, pistols, machine pistols, and a couple of RPGs. The zombie clones are the only ones that are allowed to have the RPGs. Makes sense to me. And WOW! Tons of epic acrobatic kung fu fists and flying kicks. BE FOREWARNED: There is some serious zombie neck cracking going on here.

MUTANTS: Lots of those. The gigantic baghead guys with the big meat tenderizing mallets & the lickers with the brains sticking out on top. I'll tell you what... they go down hard.

3D: Yep. Bullets and those big meat hammers come flying out at you. You WILL duck. I swear!

CARS: So many cars blow up, this flick is going to revitalize the auto industry and turn Detroit into a prosperous city of gold once again. There's even a Rolls Royce with pimp spinners doing brodies. I think I just shed a little tear.

ACTING: Forget it. There is none to be found here. But it must be said, the guy that plays Wesker is so CGI that I thought he WAS CGI. (He's not CGI, is he?) And all girls in this are wearing tight outfits. It's so hot. What's NOT to like? I developed a major crush on Michelle R years ago and I'm in Michelle Rodriguez Heaven. I'm gonna marry her some day. I promise. But, I have no desire to spend any more time in prison so I can't really stalk her. Hmmm, it's a dilemma. I'd write to her, but she'd only reject me and then I'd be crushed. I guess I'm destined to be alone with my sad loser fantasies. But, I bet I'm not the only one here. Guys? Show of hands?

BUDGET: Yeah, they spent some serious cash on this. I read that it was 65 million, but it looks like they spent at least 66 million on the submarines alone. It doesn't always show, but it's there.

SEQUEL: Oh Hell YEAH! Best ending EVER. I was eagerly anticipating the final Hobbit films, but now... I can't wait to see how they wrap this up.

I love Paul W.S. Anderson. When he dies, they should bronze his body and put him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I mean it! I love this movie sooo much I'm starting a National Resident Evil Retribution Call-In-Sick Day. So far my record is 3 times in a row. I won't sleep until I've watched this 10 times in a row. This movie deserves a special award. I haven't figured out what kind yet, but it should come with a special trophy with a chocolate chip cookie on top. It's that GOOD! I'm dead serious.

If you have been with them since the beginning then you have to have fun with these films at this point. The story is great and picks up right where the last one left off. It also leaves on a great climax like the previous films but hints that the next film will be the last one. They bring back lots of older characters in a unique way. The pace is great, the fight scenes well choreographed, and Milla is as hot as ever. Best of all is the 3D. I did not see this in the theatre but this film has the best 3D I have ever scene.

There are characters you thought were dead and plenty of set pieces that hearken back to earlier movies and if you can just allow yourself to enjoy the ride, you already pretty much know where you're going to end up.

I guess I was really bored and I am a fan of the original Playstation games etc, but Jovovich is good enough looking to carry the entire weight of this bland series of movies. Her husband is marginally talented, and basically I mean he has 0 talent... no eye for cinematographic visions regarding camera placement or original shot creation/style. All the movies including this one in 3D are bland, lifeless dirges into banality. The characters look like they are in Halloween costumes and merely speaking the dead dialogue into a void. The action scenes are trying to be camp and comic book but come off staged and fabricated like a high school play. Milla doesn't really even fill out her spandex lol, she's hot in a way but this series of movies really turned me off especially realizing the complete nepotistic situation of husband and wife/director/actress scenario going on throughout all the films. The only thing they've brought from the original mythos of the game world is the cheap tacking on of hundreds of Umbrella Corp. logos pasted all over every scene, their eyes, their wallets, their guns, their whatevers... no matter what it's got an Umbrella logo stamped on it.

My wife use to play the original game, and thought the first couple of movies did the game justice, as did the Silent Hill movie, but as the RE movies have went on, the story line got little worse and worse and futher away from the games which it was based. Retribution was incredibly horrible. Even the first 5 minutes of the movie playing the last 5 minutes of last movie in reverse was so stupid, to only have it replay again. Made us wonder if they were really that hard up for story line that they used it as filler. I would say if the plan was to continue down the current path with the RE movies, don't, as its just a waste of studios money on production. #Milla Jovovich you have some very good movies on your resume.

5352711,2,B009MO5960,"I've been watching the Resident Evil movies since the very first, and played the games before that. I've enjoyed them for being fun, somewhat over the top action flicks that value style over substance and deal out bullets and explosions by the bucketful. It's a fine balance, and with Retribution, that balance was tipped.

I say that because, for the duration of the movie, I felt like I was waiting for the opening action scene to end and the movie to actually begin. From the moment Alice wakes up in Umbrella's underwater facility, we're treated to an onslaught of explosions, evil computers, and cartoonish side characters battling them. And while that's all well and good, the movie never really left that gear. Essentially, the whole of the plot (save for the last few moments) could be boiled down to 'escape the facility'. At least the first movie had 'prevent the T-Virus from escaping' as a subplot.

The movie wasn't helped by it's direction, either. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong, but something about the special effects, acting and camerawork make the whole affair feel dangerously close to B-movie territory. Milla Jovovich is as good as she's ever been, but Luther, Albert, and Leon's characters are so stiff and one-dimensional that it really wouldn't have made any difference for me if they lived or died. Everything is over the top in the worst way, dislodging any sense of tension and excitement I felt with moments so ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh.

I will admit, though, that I still enjoyed Retribution to an extent. While that enjoyment was more primarily based in seeing old faces return (such as Michelle Rodriguez's dual role and the Red Queen's comeback), if you've seen all the other Resident Evil movies up until now, you may as well give Retribution a whirl. Otherwise, you're better off going back and watching the first few entries and leaving it at that.",1367712000,3,1903,4.867283950617284

5352718,3,B009MO5960,"The fifth film in the series, resident Evil: Retribution tries to tie up all the loose ends and introduces some new twists.  We learn that Alice is one of the 50 models that The Umbrella Corporation lieks to re-use which raises the question is Alice herself a clone because she keeps returning with the same bruise on her shoulder and trouble remembering what happened.

This movie starts where the fourth movies ends, the battle against the re-programmed Valentine and hosprey soldiers.  Alice survive but is captured again by The Umbrella Corporation and taken to their main trainign and programming complex in Russia.  This time, she is freed by Ada Wong (Bingbing Li), a former Umbrella agent who is now working with the now=rebel Wesker (Shawn Roberts).  Alice and Ada are helped by a rescue team led by Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Erb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand) and Alice's friend, turned rebel, Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) from the previous movie.  We also see that one of Alice's clones has just been killed in a simulated zombie attack and has a programmed deaf daughter, Becky (one of the 50 clone models).  The two women must make their way through a series of five simulation-settings featuring hordes of more intelligent zombies, giant axemen, and mutated monsters and meet up with the rescue team.  Complicating this story is the fact that the re-started and murderous mother computer, the Red Queen has sent Valentine and a killsquad comprised of previously-dead characters - Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), and James ""One"" Shade (Colin Salmon)who have returned via cloning to kill them. There is also a ""Good Rain"" who aids Alice and her 'daughter.' Alice dispatches the Evil Rain and frees Valentine from The Umbrella Corporation control.

The movie ends with the survivors, Alice, Ada Wong, Becky, and Leon are rescued and taken to Washington DC where Wesker who has been able to control the T-virus with a serum developed from Alice's blood is leading the remaining humans in a final stand against the zombie horde programmed by the artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen.  Alice who has been without her superpowers since the end of the third movie gets them back when Wesker re-injects her with the T-virus.  He asks her to help them in the final battle.

The movie explodes with many gunfights, stellar FX, huge body counts, gadgetry and beautiful photography.  This is a feast for the eyes but it is pure action with some twists thrown in to keep your mind processing some facts.  This is the fourth best of the series but it still holds up well.  The endless continuing plot for another movie is getting tedious and Alice's opening monologue in which she once again recounts her story is getting old.  Milla Jovovich returns with gusto and delivers another strong performance but the end is on the horizon.",1367107200,,2866,4.927234927234927

The plot was absolutely abysmal, and did not advance the storyline of the series. The movie was just a set of action scenes, one following the other in rapid succession, with very little story in between. The action scenes were stylized at times and somehow were very dry and boring - car chases, big monster, gunbattle, and then big monster. I think that you get the picture. The acting is reasonable; unfortunately the actors were given very little to work with.
  There should be some type of plot, even if the movie concepts are simple. This movie fails even that low bar. I would definitely not watch this again. This is commercialism at its worst - the studio clearly pumped this movie out to take advantage of the prior films. There was no attempt to make this movie anything of substance.
  I would rate this a 65/100, or a D as far as US high-school grades go. Any of the other RE movies I would watch, but this is a most intolerable sequel.",1366675200,2,1053,4.412371134020619

5352724,3,B009MO5960,"This film started with an odd way of rehashing the finale of the previous film, run it in reverse then forward again.  Point?  There is no point; this movie is just one long fight sequence.  Project Alice, as she is now known, is just a piece of hardware, hardwired to demolish.  Milla Jovovich doesn't even bother with the pretense of shading her character with depth.  She's no longer a mystery.  Except for a paycheck, I can see no reason for her to continue with this series, it certainly does little to prove she can act.  I'm not even certain she's not entirely CGI!  That said, I do have every installment in this series although the last few have started showing their wear.  As with the previous installment, this one also ends at a crucial point, setting up the inevitable sequel (which Jovovich has stated will be her last).
If I were asked to explain the plot, I'm not certain I could.  There's scant dialog and a confusion of settings involving playgrounds for the Umbrella Corporation to test.......things or thingies.  The Red Queen is behind everything (why someone doesn't just pull the plug on her is anyone's guess.  A lack of technology would soon put an end to her reign of terror).  As an added novelty, they dragged back some former characters/actors.  Rather than adding to the story, these people only served to confound things further.  It felt like they were only there for branding purposes, few had much to do other than shoot at someone else.  It was rather tedious towards the end with a typical fight sequence challenging poor Alice until she finally finally finally rallies.

Did I enjoy watching this movie?  Not particularly.  But I'm still keeping it with the set.  To get me interested in the next one though, they are going to have to do a whole lot better than this.

5352753,1,B009MO5960,"Then Don't.  I know, by writing a negative review about a ""niche"" film that has a core fan base, I just lower my ratings.  But I feel I have to be honest, if only to save a couple of poor souls who may regret the time and/or money spent.
How does the film go wrong?  It's hard to count the number of ways.  What's sad is that the first three Resident Evil Films were actually very good.  A distinct downward trend started in the fourth film, and unfortunately it went hyperbolic here.
When a sequel takes the first thirty minutes (OK, it only FELT like 30 minutes, it wasn't quite that long) simply EXPLAINING THE PLOT of the prior 4 movies, you start worrying that the script writers are searching for a story to tell.  Although to be honest, the plot in the prior movies was sketchy enough that having it all spelled out in sequence wasn't that bad, compared to what comes later...
This voice-over retrospective suddenly cuts to a totally different scene: Alice as a perfect suburban housewife with a perfect suburban family.  Except that zombies suddenly attack everywhere.  Then that cuts to a scene of Alice (is it real or is it Memorex--is this the original or only another clone?  Only the script writer can tell..they say it's the real Alice..) nude except for a towel covering her more ""sensitive"" areas, lying in the center of a pretty much empty research room.  We are informed that she is ""being tested"".  Exactly for what purpose cannot be explained (I think the purpose is pretty obvious--it's for the benefit of those 14 year old males to compare which Alice they like better: tight-leather-fitted Alice, or Alice with nothing but a towel?  And I think the answer is pretty clear).  Anyhow, then the facility seems to go haywire and she's being told that a former enemy is trying to help her escape from this secret ""Umbrella Corporation""  research facility, because she's the best hope to save what's left of mankind outside...

Second warning (after the laborious-explain-plot-of-4-movies sequence): you know you are in trouble, if the movie based on a video game starts to feel more like a video game than actually playing a video game...
Sonorous explanations warn Alice & friends they must ""move quickly through the New York Zone into the Berlin zone, then through that into the Moscow zone, and from there to the elevator...expect resistance along the way...I was waiting for the instructions to ""be sure to grab every power-up you can find along the way, and don't forget your save points in case you wipe"".  Well after that, basically it's just an hour or two of humans vs. zombies with various weapons...

I counted one cool idea in the entire movie, (well, besides Alice with only a small towel) which led to about 30 seconds of cool visuals.  That was the idea that this whole research facility was designed to be unescapable and pretty much undetectable, because it was built ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN in a siberian sort of port, so it's several hundred feet under water with a thick layer of ice and snow on top.  The scene showing the layout underwater was beautiful and a surprise (even  if it was CG).  The rest of the film consists of: lame plot, embarrassing script, acting on a par with the plot and script; not sure what to say about the directing; and the cinematography: well apart from wanting to look good in 3-D, there is really nothing interesting going on.

Maybe this cannot compare with the awful thud that was $800 million worth of John Carter landing in theatres--heck this was only $40 million or less, but by comparison with the prior films, therefore by comparison with expectations, and even by comparison to the money spent, it was at least as disappointing as John Carter.  Mila: save yourself!  Don't agree to another sequel, unless you THINK HARD about the script in advance.

PS: How did they find hundreds of actresses that looked so much like Alice, to put on that assembly line?  Or were they REALLLY clones?  If so, what did they DO with them after the film was finished?  I can only think this must be the kind of question that occurs to people who think this is a great film...",1363996800,8,4139,4.648351648351649

5352758,3,B009MO5960,"""Resident Evil:Retribution""(2012) directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien vs Predator, Death Race) is the fifth movie in the Resident Evil series. The movie takes place mostly inside a computer generated world that is located underwater in the Arctic Circle. This movie seems to be somewhat a departure from previous films in the series being more sci-fi action than horror. Upon first viewing this film in 2D I didn't feel that this film was particularly captivating given its rather generic characters and predictable plot, but watching it in 3D I just can't get enough of it. This is a fun, visually rich film which takes us through a myriad of environments. For those with 3D you'll be smiling from beginning to end as the images are enthralling and spectacular. This movie is a visual treat with beautifully directed and constructed environments which moves quickly from scene to scene without boring the viewer. Obviously a lot of money and thought was put into the visuals of this film, and the limited characters and story line really in the end don't seem to matter too much. Like a beautiful painting one just wants to gaze at its marvellous images.

Other recommendations for movies in 3D are Prometheus, Tron, Underworld:Awakening, Avatar, The Avengers, and Alice in Wonderland.",1363824000,4,1288,5.046948356807512

5352781,3,B009MO5960,"As in the Lord of the Rings films, if you know the material, you're likely to get more out of the film. That's not to imply that someone who is new to `Resident Evil' cannot enjoy this movie; in fact, a brief synopsis on what has happened is given at the early start of the film to relieve confusion. Yet, even with this explanation, the film is handed over to fans of the popular game series without apology. Also, one gets the sense that the raw energy and feel of the game is directly translated into the movie. A thinking piece about humanity, the purpose of life, salvation and all of that take a seat way in the back while special effects ride this vehicle into kingdom come! But you know what, neither the filmmaker nor the producers, nor advertising agencies said anything about making the RE films synonymous with finding inner peace or reaching Nirvana. They are a spectacle if I've ever watched one - full of insane action sequences & visual effects.

Oh yes, the filmmaker knows his audience well enough to deliver the goods.

If I have one small criticism, it is simply that despite all of Alice's confrontations, putting herself in danger to save mankind and so on, it would be nice to see her react in a manner that says more about who she is as a person - especially when (SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT) she isn't necessarily one of a kind and mind manipulation is easy as Sunday morning. Watching Alice strut her stuff, I can't help but recall loosely Kurt Russell's persona of Snake Plissken from John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"". I feel that Alice would benefit from some of his anti-hero qualities. He doesn't hold an allegiance to any organization and only looks out for his own interests. I feel like it's beginning to be implied, but not yet fully developed. Perhaps in the next film?

Bottom line: If you're a fan of the series, watching this is a no brainer. If you like stylized action sequences & back to back special effects, it's a fun movie to watch any evening. If you're looking for something with more meat, as opposed to frosting, yet still want to watch something starring Milla Jovovich, give The Messenger a watch but be forewarned about it's historical inaccuracies. All in all, I think Jovovich is capable of delivering an award winning performance, given the right director and opportunity.

For the most part you're getting mindless,zombie action,yet at the same time theirs parts of the films plot I felt could have been brilliant if they where explored a little bit more. The whole arch with the little girl added a lot of emotional sci-fi depth to this film,despite her role only really being briefly touched upon.
For fans of the game you get to see Barry Burton and Leon Kennedy but don't expect much. You feel no real attachment to either character and other than the looks of the characters theirs nothing very distinguishing about them. No more than pawns to keep the action coming.

The 3D here was somewhat of a letdown for me. Maybe it's just because I was expecting so much more?
Their are a few great pop out effects,but I felt the 3D was lacking depth and for the most part was a little too flat most of the time.

This movie is essentially an escape flick in which Alice has to move through 3 or 4 ""worlds"" to make an escape.  It really seemed like a 20 minute movie repeated 4 times.

It's not terrible like the Silent Hill sequel, so I was mildly entertained while watching it. Rent it or get it from the bargain bin.

For an entire movie, the plot sucked. This should've been something briefly touched on in one of the movies. It was good for 10 or 15 minutes at best.

The screenplay sucked.  To say I've seen better by college students would be a stretch at best. By high school students is more accurate.

Knowing what I do now, I wouldn't even watch this film if it was free on cable.

As a matter of note, this movie was nominated for a 2013 Razzie Award. If you're not familiar with the Razzies, they're properly known as ""The Golden Raspberry Award."" For 33 years they've been saluting the worst that Hollywood has to offer.

Unfortunately, it lacks any semblance of a good and logical story. The entire movie wasn't even relevant to the series. They create a new goal and introduced a new conflict at the start to prevent that goal and thereby spend the entire movie trying to resolve that conflict to achieve that goal. They get her captured so they can spend an entire film getting her out. Lets face it, it could of been twenty minutes of a film then gone to a serious issue. What is the real issue? Actually saving the human race. Yeah, I know, hasn't that always been the goal? Well, this time its for real. Now, its no mind bender but is at least worth one watch because, like I said, Resident Evil is an awesome series, and this movie's short comings isn't enough to completely destroy it.

Story line is almost non-existent and don't even get me started on some of the worst tactics I've ever seen in a firefight depicted on screen. Very cliche action sequences, boring camera work and lack luster music.

So I was really looking forward to Michelle Rodriguez's return in Retribution but, sadly, I was in for a major disappointment. Whereas the first four movies still had something resembling of a story to tie all of the action sense together, it seems like in this one the makers just got together to brainstorm ideas for their new movie but since they couldn't come up with anything good, they just shot every single idea they did come up with, edited them all together and called it a movie. The result is so messy it's hard to believe it was directed by the same man who made Soldier and Event Horizon. In my opinion, as much as the makers of The Walking Dead got the Zombie genre just right, that's how badly Paul W.S. Anderson missed the ball with Resident Evil: Retribution. The ending does leave an interesting opening for a 6th and hopefully final instalment but it's going to be tough to make up for this one.",1360022400,,1192,4.627358490566038

Milla's fight scenes as usual were spectacular and it made the movie worth watching. The balance of the acting was poorly done and in particular the acting of Seinna Guillory (Jill Valentine) was wooden and just awful.  She looked like she was reading the cue cards.

The special effects were worth watching but if this series is going to continue then it is going to need some fresh writing with a real script and other actors beside just Milla to help carry the work load.

(I don't remember the title and I don't want to remember the title)  This ResEvil movie really wasted major opportunity to use and involve the actors of past episodes.....really wasted....completely wasted. It blows my mind that so much money can be put into the production of a movie (more money than a working stiff like me will make in a lifetime)and still have a pile of canon fodder come out as the result. (I can't say foul expletives here so ""fodder"" will have to do)",1359158400,,894,4.518518518518518
5352936,1,B009MO5960,"No one goes into a Resident Evil flick thinking, ""Oh boy! This will be an amazing cinematic experience!""  I think we can all agree that it takes greatly lowered expectations to even enjoy the films. But what the Resident Evil films lack in depth, thematics, and acting, they make up for in over-the-top action, CGI creatures, and Milla Jovovich wearing a skintight body suit.

However, even Milla's almost naked bandaged body cannot redeem Resident Evil: Retribution. From the start, her monotone narration set a sleepy tone that confused me for the rest of the film. What happened? Where are we? Who are these people? What are they doing? What happened to the story? Why do I care?!  The movie was blur, leaving an ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" blank spot in my memory. It all looks familiar, feels familiar, yet I remember nothing.",1359158400,,843,4.840277777777778

This is not my favorite entry into the series.  It was a little choppy, though I did get a kick out of seeing Carlos and Rain and Jill again.  Even though Carlos and Rain weren't exactly Carlos and Rain.  This movie actually seemed more like a video game than the others, but I liked it anyway.  And I'm glad they set it up for another sequel.

5352955,3,B009MO5960,"Hate it or love it, the Resident evil franchise has created success in both the box office and in making new fans to the RE world.
RE retribution is the 5th film in the series that started more than 10 years ago, here the film picks up from where the last film ended, where we find Alice "" played by the one and only Milla Jovovic "" on board the Arcadia fighting off the Umbrella army, she gets captured and send to their underwater facility for interrogation, down there she finds a hidden friend within the Umbrella cooperation who helps her escape, and throughout the movie we follow ALice as she tries to escape the facility with the aid of some of her older fiends and allies. of course she faces all kind of threat that we all know and familiar with from the RE world, including Zombies, monsters and Umbrella soldiers.

the plot is quite simple and basic and is very similar to most of the previous RE films, which does not add anything special or might be shallow for the people who take these films seriously. the action on the other hand offers a lot more, there are several well executed action scenes with fresh ideas, impressive visuals, the jaw dropping type of visuals. very stylish and professional stuff.

personally, my favorite RE movie is split between Afterlife and Apocalypse, both were very interesting, adding more fresh and interesting characters "" Claire, Jill "" and the action was solid as usual.
so why did Retribution fall in ranking ? well, i found it weak in several areas, for example, here we were introduced to new characters, but those characters were rushed into the plot without any background, which made us care less about them and about their survival, not to mention they added a bigger number of new faces than usual.  It was a bit of a mess.

another problem, is that the plot started to shift further and further into fantasy and away from reality. now i understand that these films are SCiFi, meaning they were not intended to be realistic, however, i found the previous 4 films believable, you can relate to them some how, but this one was too SciFi for me, if you can get my meaning.
things like multiple clones, Zombie soldiers, futuristic models based on huge cities, Umbrella controlling simulations to detail is just way over fetched. some scenes seemed odd somehow, weird and at times even ridiculous.

I also hated the fact that they didn't tell us what ever happened to Clair and Chris from the previous Afterlife movie !

having said that, i still had a kick out of watching this movie, as mentioned, action was solid not to forget its always a joy to watch Milla as Alice, she owned that role.

reading some reviews here, it seems a lot of people were taking these films very seriously and are expecting a solid drama with a complicated twisted plot, which is not the case with these films, they are mainly brainless action films with style.
other people are still moaning that Anderson "" the director "" took the RE series into a different direction from the Video games, which i don't understand, the guy bought the right to making the film, he got it and probably with a high price and now he is free to do what ever he wants with it, his visions and his style, so people need to grow up and just accept that, its been 10 years already and they are still moaning about it.
i guess now they can rest a bit with the two animated RE movies that came out, it might give some of the obsessed some closure. i only watched Degeneration and it was good enough, but to me not as a good as the live films.

the picture on this Blu ray is awesome, its clean and smooth like looking through a glass not a TV screen provided that you have the High definition connections and all that, same has to be said about the audio and sound, speaking of audio i forgot to mention that Retribution, despite its short comings it had a fantastic soundtrack, probably the best in the series.
the Blu Ray also had a bunch of special features which i couldn't and really didn't care to go through them all which are listed above in the product details if you really care about that stuff, as for me, i only go for the movies usually and don't care much about the features.

so to summarize, not the best in the series, but still a solid addition to the successful RE movie series with Mill Jovovic doing her best, impressive visuals and action scenes. worthy to add to your collection if you're a fan of the series or of good action.",1358899200,,4462,4.465030674846626

It wasn't horrible but the story was little confusing.  They also showed leon in the movie but they didn't really give him much of a introduction or a role in this series with alice so it was kind weird for him to just pop in.

5352987,1,B009MO5960,"Resident Evil:  Retribution is the fifth installment of the Resident Evil franchise, which comes only weeks after the summer blockbuster season concludes, meaning maybe the studio didn't have complete faith in it?  Regardless, the plot is similar to the last four films, but it will never - no matter how many of the original characters return - be as good as the first or even second film.

As usual, Milla Jovovich returns as Alice to take on the dreaded Umbrella Corporation, who has finally caught Alice, only to lose her - and then team up with her against the Red Queen.  Confused?  Well, let's wait until the next film for some more clarity on who's good, who's bad, and how much of the world isn't completely destroyed.  Michelle Rodriguez co-stars in dual roles (both of whom are clones - naturally), along with new-comer Aryana Engineer as Alice's daughter.

In the end, there's very little need for a review of the plot/graphics/plot because it's the same as the previous films.  If you've seen the first four films and enjoyed them, then you will most likely enjoy this new film.  It's action-packed with lots of bullets and explosions.  There are zombies/monsters at every turn to provide the scare factor - and the 3D is pretty decent (even though it's a money racket, too).

This film this is simply more of the same.  Each new film in this franchise is essentially the same plot recycled over and over, simply delaying the announcement of a final installment to bring the franchise to an end.  However, as with other franchises, if the money keeps coming, the movies will keep being made.  With that being said - anticipate a few more films in the future.

Everytime its on tv I watch it,,,when I found out they made a part five I was saying awsome for ever until it was released on dvd which I had to buy right then and there. Would go see it at thearters but daddy don't like scary movies he says they are bad blah blah blah... I well take a night or nightmares just to watch this...So far I have not watched the fifth movie I am watching the entire series over again so I well be updated on what is going on in the fifth movie I well do a update after I watch the latest and hopefully not last RE movie...

UPDATE 7/20/2013
Took me a while to get to this review I have seen this movie more then once it was pleasant to see a alternate universe in this movie no spoilers on how that happened...I would pick this up again and again if I needed to I have all five movies and would not trade them for anything in the universe. This movie was awesome Alice rocks she is so brave and a good fighter the only thing that comes close to this is Underworld series...you have to go out and get this movie you won't be disappointed!!!!!

5352992,3,B009MO5960,This might be the worst movie yet in the resident evil series. In all honesty I only bought it because I'm OCD. I buy just about every video game and comic book movie. The first resident evil movie was great I enjoyed it a lot and felt that it was going to be the start of a beautiful well done series. But like all good things they never last. Then the second movie came out. I was so excited to see it. then when I saw it I felt like I had been slapped in the face. It was horrible. I then waited for the 3rd on to come out on dvd before I bought it and it was eh. I liked it except for the super powers. I mean Weasker gets them in the games but hers were just simply stupid and the clones. then the 4th one I thought it was stupid with the clones but they died off and she lost her super powers and I was happy again. so over all the 4th one I enjoyed it wasn't the best movie ever but it was better than 2 and 3. Then I saw this....... the movies don't even make sense any more. weasker is alive again but this time he is good when the virus was taking him over and going to kill him. and he gives her back her super powers. idk. Just looking at all the movies together in a row. they don't make sense. they just seem to come up with random ideas and throw them in there. they don't flow.,1358294400,,1293,3.828358208955224

5352999,5,B009MO5960,"I am a big fan of the resident evil movies. That's why I gave it 5 stars. That being said the story line could be a bit better.

Milla is a great action heroine. As with all the actors I felt they did a great job making me feel that I was right there with them. Thank god there was no over done one liners that cheese up any movie when over used. the return of the Red Queen was a good surprise, though not much of a lead in to her appearance.

The bad...like many other people have commented all over the web. The first movie really sucks you in but the preceding ones dropped the ball, whether it's bad writing or directing hard to say. Can't really blame the actors since they usually don't have much choice. I was lost in parts of this movie because there were discussions about a new virus (that Rain injected into herself) and who is Ava and why did Wesker suddenly change sides. We as the audience were given a brief explanation and forced to swallow it. I didn't like that. All in all this movie was about a push to answer some questions and set up a final movie while leaving the audience in limbo...expecting a movie and not something that could have been done as a 30 minute straight to DVD rental titled ""Resident Evil...Questions answered"".

I hope....really hope that the writers and director really go all out on the final movie not only ending the series but making it as good as the first movie, but better. For me, that would let me over look some of the movies that missed the mark.

people only remember the first and last movie of a series...if they are great movies.",1358294400,,1588,4.301003344481606
5353000,1,B009MO5960,"Having put off watching this series for years, I caught the first one on cable a few weeks ago and was hooked.  Monsters, sci-fi, end of the world, females kicking rears, huge action scenes?  Why did i miss out?  So I purchased the first four Blu-ray discs in a set.  I loved them all.  Sure, some were a little ridiculous, but overall, I see myself playing them on a slow day (snow day? rain day? etc).  I watched the Extinction and Afterlife back to back,...

...and then I rented Retribution immediately after finishing the  Afterlife.

Retribution is terrible.  For one, it's maybe 80 minutes long, and nothing much really happens to move the story along.  Sure, i get that it was a device to advance some characters in the story, introduce a few more, and introduce the Las Plagas parasite.  But, really, at most this should have been a 1-hour animation.  A straight-to-DVD special release of some sort.  An animated Webisode released prior to the release of the next one.  I mean, to be honest, most of this could have been covered during the intro to the next installment in about ten or fifteen minutes, or as back flashes.

5353012,5,B009MO5960,"I don't get the people who trash these movies. What are they expecting? The RE series has never been about superb storytelling, characterization, and acting. It's about style and excitement! And that's what these movies are: High-octane action movies for guys. Especially their inner 14-year olds.

People here spend a lot of time trashing the RE movies, and this movie in particular. Why? It delivers what I've come to expect here. Some awesome action sequences, an interesting (albeit completely nonsensical) storyline, and some really incredible cinematography. What else do you want? I submit that if that's not good enough for you, then you're just watching the wrong kind of movie.

Those who trash the story of Resident Evil: Retribution as ""the worst of the lot"", or whatever, need to go watch something else. It is what it is. I for one think it is excellent!

I like how the storylines of the movies continue from movie to movie, which each one ending in a cliffhanger. You never know what the next movie will bring! Yeah, the story is complete garbage. But that's what's enjoyable about it! Invite a few friends, have a beer, put your brain firmly in the ""off position"", and enjoy!

And there's a lot to enjoy here. The awesomeness that is Milla Jovovich cannot be denied.  Sure, the character of Alice is weak, and in this movie, she turns into Ripley. But when she's killing zombies with a chain and pistol, it's so awesome I don't care. My brain says, ""This sucks."" My inner 14-year old says, ""THIS IS AWESOME, DUDE!"" That's what happens, man. If you want to enjoy it, you just have to surrender to the awesome.

The movie has a lot of interesting ideas. I also like that it took a lot of elements from the RE 4 video game, which I loved. Leon Kennedy is here, and so is Ada Wong. They both certainly look the part, although their characterization is actually STRONGER in the video game than in the movie! Here, they're just generic action heroes, but I'm okay with that.

Another cool element from RE 4 (the game) was the introduction of the Los Plagues (sp?) virus. A lot of people were confused by the zombie nazi's driving jeeps. But in the context of RE 4, this makes more sense. In that game, a small European village was taken over by the Los Plagues virus. It doesn't turn people into zombies exactly - rather it changes their insides to be like bugs and changes their minds. So they still can operate weapons and such. And some of them were clothed in military style uniforms, same as the game and movie. If you haven't played the game, then this doesn't make so much sense. I thought it was a pretty cool tie-in.

Another thing I am really liking about the this movie and also ""Afterlife"" is the 3D. The 3D in these movies is really well done. Out of all the 3D movies in my collection, those two movies probably have the best 3D of all, and that's really saying something. Again, it just shows how good these movies are when it comes to the cinematography.

So the final verdict? Resident Evil: Retribution is awesome! It is my favorite of all the RE movies so far. Those who say it is ""the worst"" just don't know what they're talking about. They're watching the wrong type of movie, expecting the wrong things. I watch these movies with only a few expectations: Excellent fight choreography, excellent cinematography, and an interesting story (that I don't expect will make sense). This movie delivers on ALL THREE of those. And it sets things up nicely for RE 6.

So don't listen to the haters. This is not Oscar-worthy material. It doesn't pretend to be. It is a mindless-junk action movie for the mindless-junk action movie lover's soul! And it totally rocks.

I'll see the 6th movie once it comes around, but I'm not entirely excited about it...hoping at least that it's better than this one.  Some of the acting was mediocre at best too.

5353037,1,B009MO5960,"I have nothing to say. words can't describe what i feel about this movie.

this is going down as one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!",1357776000,,139,3.9642857142857144
5353038,3,B009MO5960,"So let's be honest here. As the series of RESIDENT EVIL movies has progressed they've become less about being a real movie and more about being a visualization of the first person shooter game that began the whole thing. That was starting to show in the last film but in this current release it becomes even more apparent.

Picking up immediately where the last film left off we once more have items tossed our direction as the film lives up to it's 3-D hype with weapons tossed about and at the audience every so often to make sure you're paying attention. If you're not watching it in 3-D (I wasn't) then you just see items tossed at the camera and don't feel the need to duck every few minutes.

We learn a little more about Alice (Mila Javovich) but not much and once again she finds herself captured and unconscious. With the help of Ada Wong she escapes, arms herself and begins the carnage. A white hallway filled with zombie types soon finds itself splattered in red with dead bodies left and right. But of course Alice escapes.

Alice learns that the Umbrella Corporation is sitting back and watching the T virus run rampant across the globe, doing nothing to stop it. I always found this a little odd since most corporations' goals are to achieve wealth and power and a world over run by zombies would provide neither not to mention no fuel or sustainable food source. But that's logic talking.

Somehow Alice ends up working with her arch enemy from the series, Wesker, who sees some of the problems that have arisen. Instead of being pitted against him she is now pitted against the Red Queen, the computer that looks like a child in holographic image seen in the first film. A team sent in to help Alice is on the way but of course she stops to help a little girl who thinks Alice is her mother since a clone of Alice was with her earlier. Trust me if you watch it it makes sense. Then again the girl is a clone as well. There are tons of clones in this series.

What I've offered here is more plot than is actually seen here. Most of it is offered in bits and pieces throughout the 96 minute running time. This film isn't about plot though, it's about action and there is plenty of that here. Well action and CGI creatures that want Alice dead. Some of the main creatures from the original game show up here rendered nicely via CGI.

But that's the thing that might be the downfall of this film series. It has less and less to do with story and more and more to do with just all out action. Don't get me wrong, I love action films. But it's much more fun to see an action film based around a story. This movie feels like your sitting beside someone playing the game and watching how they do.

While not the most terrible film I've ever seen it doesn't leave me much hope for another film. And the ending of this one like all the rest leaves it wide open for a cataclysmic last chapter. If it happens I might watch for a $2 rental but I doubt I'd shell out the bucks to own it, even if I wanted a complete series on my shelf.",1357776000,,3038,4.300699300699301

5353055,1,B009MO5960,"This movie is so truly awful, its almost unreal. I have been a fan of the games since their creation, and years ago when they came out with the first film, I was really excited to see it come to the big screen. Like most, I found the first couple films to be mediocre, but not all bad. There were good fighting sequences, and the CGI was done well enough, so I didn't feel the first couple to be a complete waste of my time. The next movie was on the verge of awful, but still not all bad and had a few redeeming qualities. It was the film which is the prequel to this one where I started wondering ""what am I doing still watching this?"" They spent so much time focused on the fact that it was in 3D and being sure there was enough crap flying at the screen that they didn't seem to even bother to write a good plot or any proper character development. But Retribution takes the cake in the ""which one is worst"" contest. Retribution was an overall waste of my time. To be honest, I never intended to see this movie, but my husband wanted to watch it so we rented from the redbox. I tried to keep an open mind, but it was no use. Of course once again, too much time was focused on things flying at the screen, and once again, no character development and no overall plot. But the worst thing about this film in my opinion was where they drag you through ten minutes of recap over the past four films. I highly doubt there was anyone watching this that hadn't been following the other movies, and since these movies never run more than an hour and a half, ten minutes of recap and seven minutes of the opening sequence shown to you first backward and in slow motion during the initial opening credits and then again after the recap, so I felt to be a giant waste of what little time there is to get to the point. Seventeen minutes out of an hour and a half film is a significant chunk of time that could have been put to better use. Then there's the kid Alice picks up from one of the ""simulated outbreak scenarios"" which she decides to become a mother to simply because she was programmed to be her mother in an a simulation (I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV"" is what it made me think of). I was also very disappointed in the portrayal of Ada Wong. Her part was too short, and there was no effort made to get to know her character, or anyone else for that matter. This movie was an overall disappointment and if I could give it zero stars I would. I will not be watching the next film.

I have the complete series on Resident Evil & this is the worse one. I not even going to keep the movie because I have intention to see it again. I got SO tired of the fighting that I put it on fast forward. Unless I was so bored that I missed it, but there is no explanation on what happened to the characters: Claire, her brother & K-Mart. Also, all resident evils kill off characters that really make the movies. I have no clue what is going on & not about to watch it again. In Afterlife the character (will spell wrong) Westler was evil & one of those things. In this movie he isn't. What's that all about?

The entire plot of the movie could have been written on a post-it but that's okay; it's not what I was looking for.  The sets were large and fairly neat but they made no sense at all.  A complex, underwater, different full size scenarios that were absurd.  Not going to give spoilers but just to highlight an example of the plot inconsistencies:  Near the beginning a ""scene"" is instantly populated out of nowhere with ""holographic people"" who a short while later are described as and treated as clones, living breathing, killable real people.... what?!  This kind of incoherent and and dumb story telling might be partially forgivable with really great action scenes and choreography but the movie fell short there too.  Despite  supposed elite squadrons being introduced, the battleground positioning, movements, tactics, use of suppressive fire etc were non-existent.  There was nothing of any interest or intellect presented whatsoever at all.  The weapons of choice for our heroin was selected off a rack of yet another silly designed set, a Vector SMG with no sights on the rail and regular non-extended magazines that were able to fire infinite amounts of ammo.  The only interesting scene in the entire movie involved two giant Axeman appear.  In short, a complete lack of logical consistency in the plot, intelligent actions from the characters or any sort of thought provoking twists left me bored at this shallow piece of fluff, a terrible movie.",1357516800,,1616,4.962825278810409

I know the earlier titles were much heavier, higher quality, actual METAL covers, which is what the title 'Steelbook' would imply. But this one, and the last also, have been very thin, flimsy sort of covers that do not even feel metallic anymore.

5353110,3,B009MO5960,"I'm not as dismissive of the Resident Evil film franchise as them angry diehard gamers who'd slammed it for being empty iterations and for skirting the game's canon storylines and continuity. I'm a fan of Milla Jovovich and of her Project Alice, a character created solely for the cinematic adaptation of Capcom's survival horror video game. I had fun watching the first four films, especially the first two. So, there, that was the carrot. Here comes the stick: RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION, latest and fifth in the film franchise, is a mess.

It picks up right where RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE left off, with a brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and her Umbrella strike force about to storm the Arcadia tanker on which Alice and her friends await with lumps in their throats. RETRIBUTION's opening moments detail Valentine's successful assault and we soon see a captured Project Alice transported to a sprawling underground facility in frozen northern Russia, Umbrella Corporation's prime testing ground for its biohazard experiments. Alice learns that the homicidal artificial intelligence dubbed the Red Queen is back in control and means to advance its anti-humanity agenda. Elsewhere, a small rescue team deploys, composed partly of ex-Umbrella operative Ada Wong (Bingbing Li), Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), and returning partner in zombie-slaying Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). But this is Project Alice, the post-apocalyptic badasss. Does she really require rescuing? (Yes, she does.)

RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION unfolds like a video game, something that eventually took me out of the story, what there is of it. Most of the film consists of Alice and others navigating the Umbrella underground complex and fighting off various biohazards. That the complex extends for blocks and constitutes isolated set pieces designed to simulate Raccoon City, Tokyo, New York, and Moscow bolsters the video game impression. It feels like Alice, each time she moves on to the next city backdrop, is advancing to the next level. It's a conceit that's old hat by now. It lends to that cynical, soulless feel. And, of course, whenever you hear a supporting character say things like ""Another minute, we're gonna be okay"" or ""Are you kidding? I'm going with you,"" well, you automatically write them off.

There is some admirable stuff. The introduction of the deaf girl Becky allows for a humanizing element for Alice who, like Ripley in ALIENS, takes on a mothering role. It's interesting that the zombies have evolved to the point where they now can ride motorcycles and fire weapons. There are some pretty cool brutal kills. I can never get enough of Jovovich in her tight leathers and platform shoes and applying her wire-fu and wasting hordes of CG monsters. I also liked that former cast members return (Guillory, Kodjoe, Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr), although the doubling up of several characters leaves me ambivalent. Do we really need good and evil versions of Rain Ocampo and Carlos Olivera? And what ever happened to Claire and Chris Redfield?

Paul W. S. Anderson - who in real life is married to Milla Jovovich - wrote, produced, and directed RETRIBUTION. It takes a certain talent and doggedness to produce hollow moneymakers like RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION. Never mind that he's bypassed Capcom's original take; you can get away with lack of faithfulness to the source material. But you lose street creds when what you come up with is hamfisted and numbing and trite. Give him a nod for trying to piece together various dangling plot threads from a decade's worth of films. But the execution collapses under such weight. And to echo them diehard gamers, Anderson's inclusion of ingame characters feels more like a slight because he doesn't respect their canonical backstories and, by extension, the game mythology. Me, I'm not much of a gamer so I was able to overlook Anderson's diverging from game mythology. As mentioned, I enjoyed the first four films. But RETRIBUTION feels a lot like treading water and feels mechanical. I hear Anderson's already working on the sixth film. Listen, today, anyone can produce serviceable CG effects. Nowadays, you have to fall back on archaic filmmaking methods to stand out. A method like, oh I dunno, competent storytelling. A disheartened, middle of the pack 2.5 out of 5 stars for RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION. I'm crossing my fingers for the sixth installment.",1357344000,,4413,5.150627615062762

As a friend sat next to me explaining that new characters were not truly new, they were from the video games, I became quite lost in the story. The Resident Evil series had seemed to me one that ran independent of the video games. Now there are so many tie ins to the game series that I am not sure what is going on.

The action in this game is refined from the previous overuse of the 3D function.

Throw in a couple of plot twists, stages, bosses, returning villains, absurd costumes etc etc). Its a ridiculous premise but who cares?

Why are there several versions of cities in an underwater Russian facility? Why not!!
Characters we thought dead returned to life? Excellent! Bring on evil Michelle Rodriguez.
Why is that woman wearing a red dress in the middle of a frozen wasteland? Because its Ada Wong, the B*T#@ in the red dress.

Seriously, turn your brain off and enjoy the action. Its a good time for all.

The original concept has been lost in the sequel ether, possibly to return in the finale.

Yes, apparently Milla and husband/drector Paul Anderson are planning a finale for Alice. I wondered why until I went to Wikipedia to see what it has grossed so far.

Like where the hell did Chris, and Claire, go? They were there on the boat at the end of Afterlife, and yet they're magically gone at the beginning of this film with no explanation. Or the whole dumb VR simulation world, that just serves as a way to bring back some old characters (though I did like seeing the black team leader who got killed off in the first film).

I enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie a lot but was disappointed because they didn't use none of the characters from the game(not that I remember.been a long time since i seen the original).lots of actions and pretty good storyline.stayed along the same lines of the games.

The second one was my favorite.it had some of the characters from the game and almost non stop action.just like the game and the reason I got into the games.

The third one bored me.lame storyline and very little action.i honestly could not tell you what it was about.

The fourth one was pretty good.same story line but was kinda lame on the action but for the most part really good.especially since they finally put in Albert Wesker.so  was looking forward to this one

I love the fact that it is non stop action.it is like most of the movie is just pure action.so that was a plus for me.some say all the action stunk but if that is the reason you got into the movie,then it didn't not let down.

The problem is the storyline.it is really hard to follow.one minute they are fighting together.then against each other. I thought they would go after Wesker more but Wesker helps them out.and the whole thing takes place in Moscow.it seems like it is the same boring storyline over and over with nothing new. I am not saying take away the them fighting Zombies or people infected with something.but are they going to play this whole thing with wesker out for 4,5 more movies?

i think they need to change it up some.a new story line,new characters,etc.

It is a good movie but i think the storyline is wearing thin.it is always Alice that saves the day.they should find something new like a new main character,new bad guys,anything. I don't think this movie can last much longer along the same storyline.it is like 5 different remixes of the same song.after a while,it is just the same song being beat to death.",1357171200,,2155,4.435443037974683

After watching tons of 3D movies, I have to say that everything looks good in 3D, but every now and then you come across a film that you can tell was made to be seen in that format.

From the get-go, round one in the series, there were those that criticized the lack of cohesion from the films to the games.  Yeah?  Well, suck it up.  As a few other reviewers pointed out, the games take days to finish.  How did anyone expect an hour and a half film to condense a weeks worth of game play?  For those that lamented the supposed gaping plot holes, to you I say this: Shut up and enjoy the movie for what it is!  None of these films was ever going to win an Oscar.  You're taking yourselves, and these films, WAY too seriously!  This movie is a joy ride, from beginning to end, for those of us that love the movies for themselves and aren't trying to compare them to the games that inspired them.  I can't play the games in a dark room- they scare me.  But these movies were never meant to do more than make you jump in surprise occasionally.  And this latest edition delivers on that front and so many others.  The action sequences are incredibly well choreographed and mapped out.  Ok, so there's not a lot of character development. Who cares?  The majority of the cast you're already familiar with.  And they even threw in a few extra folks from the games to appease the die-hard fanatics who haven't stopped moaning since the first film.  You even get to see a few familiar faces from the previous films.  I missed Oded.  He's nice to look at.  I missed Michelle Rodriguez- it was just nice to see her in a film again.  And for her to pick up her bad-ass boots and put them back on?  Mores the better!  The plot was simple... but did it really need to be complicated?  There are a few human touches in there to remind us of why we all root for Alice to begin with, besides Milla just being incredibly fun to look at.

If you didn't like the film, that's on you.  It's not the film's fault.  I think Resident Evil: Retribution was just what it ought to be.  It was fun, occasionally funny, action-packed, and not nearly as predictable, or plot-hole riddled as some of these critics would have you believe.  If you're that worried about wasting your money, rent it first.  But at least give it a chance.  I only wish I had taken the time to see it in theaters.  This kinda film was made for the big screen.

Perhaps now,that she has the virus in her again, we will see some of her awesome super powers in the next film. The story does need to be heading somewhere, and at the end of this film,it shows a final show down. This of course seems to happen in every film.

5353194,5,B009MO5960,"Retribution was actually a top notch sci-fi action thriller.

All the critics giving it one star are doing so because they didn't like the story or because it's not exactly like the video game. If you can hear me rolling my eyes it's because they are tearing out of their sockets.

Here's the thing: if this was the first film of the RE series these same fans would have downright pissed themselves in excitement.

This film has some interesting new story elements as well as some recycled ones. There are some new characters and some recycled ones. With nearly a dozen faces, I knew the character development would be minimal. That's fine. The main characters have already been well established, so I took this film at face value--as an action romp with fire fights and kick ass fight sequences.

As for the basic plot, it turns out the sinister Red Queen program is back and she has overtaken Umbrella's flagship testing facility and is conducting her own experiments.

Alice is captured and brought here, meanwhile there is an ongoing rescue mission to get her out.

Admittedly, it's a straight forward and easy to follow plot. The rest is window dressing.

The action is nonstop, and even though there is little character development this time around, this film is not a drama building piece but a push to the grand finale of the series. It woks like a shot of adrenalin and doesn't let up till the very end.

Now to address some of the critics concerns.

Those saying Retribution has too many plot holes obviously haven't watched any of the other Resident Evil movies. At least, not with their eyes open. Those saying it lacks the depth of the games aren't wrong, but whenever has a thirty hour game translated well to an hour and a half feature film?

That said this is a gorgeous looking film, especially on Bluray 3D. The choreography and action sequences are par to none, and the CG is surprisingly good. It may not have the finish or polish of a film like Avengers, but Retribution's budget being a fraction of other blockbusters, I think the SFX are more than believable.

As far as action sci-fi goes, this film is excellent. If you want more character depth and horror filled zombie moments then I recommend you try AMC's The Walking Dead.

If you're an action film buff, enjoy sci-fi, and are a Milla Jovovich fan then this film hits the sweet spot.",1356912000,4,2363,4.640287769784172

5353214,2,B009MO5960,"Resident Evil: Retribution brings in a Resident Evil dream cast. Most of the previous cast has been brought back... through cloning. Which is perfectly plausible, it just didn't feel like the story I wanted to see after the last movie ended at such a peak. The story is that the main heroine Alice wakes up in an underground testing facility where the evil Umbrella corporation puts together simulated scenarios of what would happen if zombies were to overrun specific areas of the world. So its like a fantasy chamber where anything can happen including the resurrection of previous cast members and thrown into different roles. Why are they in different roles? Because they are clones. Don't think that I ruined anything for you, because it is explained after the first five minutes.

For those that care about the story, there are plenty of plot twists, but so many that it doesn't seem to have any emphasis or punch to it. Kind of like there was no time taken to let you breathe in what the twists meant.

There is a lot of fluff in this movie to pad out the 90 minutes. Fluff like dream sequences, finishing off the final moments of the previous movie and setting up the next movie. The last movie ended at an awesome peak and after a quick action sequence it was as if I was tricked into buying a DVD. In fact I have a feeling the next movie will make me feel that way.

The core of this movie is action. Plenty of action, almost too much of it to the point that its boring. In fact there was so much action that the deleted scenes are extended action sequences. That means the director realized it was too much so he took it out. I love action movies, but there is something to be said about pacing, highs and lows, cranking up the tension and sequences, but this movie fails to make the sequences stand out.

Take a pass on seeing this movie. The only thing worth seeing is the last 2 minute pull away which they already showed in the trailer. The movie is a big piece of fluff... but perhaps if you just need nonstop wall to wall action and slow motion latex scenes, this is your movie and by all means give it a try.",1356739200,,2126,4.374683544303798

5353218,2,B009MO5960,"I always find it interesting when an action film feels weighted down in tedium. No matter how many things explode onscreen or how much people jump around shooting with semi-automatic rifles, it just can't rile up any sense of excitement. These were my thoughts when reflecting on ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" after weathering through an hour and a half of tired action movie clichs, slow motion cinematography, and 3D gimmicks.

Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an underwater Umbrella facility where she must travel through different T-virus testing simulations to escape. Along the way, she meets up with an associate of Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) named Ada (Li Bingbing). She informs her that Wesker is trying to help her escape to join his fight against the Umbrella Corporation and the undead. Wesker also put together a team made up of Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand), and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) to retrieve the two girls.

Alice and her rescuers come up against different varieties of the undead as well as a group of familiar faces the Red Queen (Ave Merson-O'Brian) is using to intimidate and fight against them. The team is led by a brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and made up of clones of Alice's dead associates including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos (Oded Fehr) and James ""One"" Shade (Colin Salmon). Can Alice get to safety and discover why her old opponent Wesker needs her help so bad?

I know the movie is based on a video game, but does ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" have to feel like I'm just watching someone else play it? A script is almost non-existent as the film takes viewers through different simulated ""testing"" grounds for at least an hour of the 95-minute running time. Just like in a video game, you go into a room with a character, defeat whatever monsters are in it, and then move on to the next one and do it all again. If I wanted to play the game, I would have just rented the latest version and skipped this mess.

Director / writer Paul W.S. Anderson found a way to shove as many of the old characters from the other movies into this one through his use of clones as assassins and gunners for the Umbrella Corporation. Besides Michelle Rodriguez's Rain, the other returning actors have little to do except shoot guns while running and jumping around on wires.

The CGI and visual effects aren't too bad. However, the final sequence of the movie looks like it was pulled straight off of Capcom's game. It looks ridiculously animated and really closes the film on a negative note. There also seems to be some kind of synthetic sheen over any scenes featuring Jovovich that give them an artificial air.

You can't fault the video or audio quality of ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" for an unpleasant viewing experience. The picture is clear, vibrant, and is at least easy on the eyes. The 5.1 surround sound will please audiences as explosions, gunfire, screams, and other grotesque noises are spread throughout the speakers in their home theater.

One thing I can say positive about the ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" Blu-ray is it's packed with special features. They include two different commentaries with filmmakers and cast, outtakes, deleted and extended scenes, several ""Behind-the-Scenes"" featurettes, and an interactive database. One featurette that many will find interesting is ""'Resident Evil: Retribution' - Face of the Fan"" in which series devotee Dylan Syrett shares her experience visiting the set of the movie.

""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is a disappointing entry in the franchise. I watched ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" after watching this and it just furthermore pounded home how laborious ""Retribution"" is. Many enthusiasts of these movies may find themselves feeling like they're sitting on a couch with their hands tied behind their backs while being forced to watch a friend play ""Resident Evil 6"" for an hour and a half. It's just not a very pleasant predicament to find yourself in.",1356739200,,3988,4.995481927710843
5353219,1,B009MO5960,I've only seen a few other movies in my 40 years that were worse than this one. Save you money. This thing will never give you back your hour and a half that it takes to swallow this movie.,1356739200,,189,3.871794871794872

5353222,5,B009MO5960,"I think this is my second favorite Resident Evil movie of the franchise. People are always going to complain about the character of Alice because she is not to be found in any of the games and was an original character created by the director of the Resident Evil franchise film series. But as much as people complain about this, these movies are still doing okay box office wise. So even though people don't like to freely admit it, they seem to actually like the character of Alice.

With that being said, this would be my favorite of the series as far as a completely original story goes. Its actually highly entertaining, it has amazing visuals and great sound. It brings in a few more new characters from the Resident Evil games that they have not put in any of the other movies before which was cool, and they brought back Wesker which is probably my favorite character from the actual games.

I would say that Resident Evil: Apocalypse is still my favorite Resident Evil movie so far because it is the one that resembles an actual Resident Evil game the most (Resident Evil 3: Nemesis). But, I wouldn't put Resident Evil Retribution very far behind it at all because it is so highly entertaining. It might possibly be even better because of the 3D.

As far as the 3D goes this has got to be one of the BEST 3D movies I've ever seen. A lot of people seem to say that the 3D in Resident Evil Afterlife was better but I have to disagree. I think this movie had more pop-out shots as well as CONSTANT DEPTH. It looked so freaking amazing. It would have to be one of my top 5 3D movies to date. Had this movie not had the amazing 3D I probably would only give this movie 3 or 4 stars but I really wasn't expecting the 3D to be this good. This movie is worth the purchase just for the 3D alone.",1356739200,,1795,4.289085545722714

No story, no development, just rehashing from prior movies and some tossed in fighting sequences.

One of the few times that I paid nearly full price for a blu ray when originally released, and hopefully my regret will save someone else this disappointment.

The acting was mediocre, unfortunately.
It just seemed like it was a movie that was made just because they could; with no possible quality story line or plot as well as reasoning. AND, as I had predicted, it trails off at the end to reveal that there could possibly be another movie. But why? There's absolutely no reason for it.

Now the movie rolls forward from the end of the last mission to Alice falling in the ocean water. Suddenly, we see Alice waking up in her home. It is morning. Her red hair is longer. Her husband looks like Carlos (Oded Fehr) and she has a daughter, Becky (Aryana Engineer). As her husband comes out of the kitchen, he is attacked by a biohazard zombie. Alice grabs Becky and hides in the laundry room. Now a whole bunch of zombies are after her. She makes a hole in the ceiling that leads to the attic. (Must be soft wood). Now with Alice and Becky up in the attic, you will just have to watch the rest of the movie to find out what happens next.

The CGI was not impressive and neither was the 3D. A few gratuitous 3D moments are in the movie (glasses or a knife being thrown at you) - but even those were really weak.

decent action
brief glimpse of a nice Ferrari
tons of zombies and zombie killing

Cons:
Bad directing
poorly written script and bad one-liners
cheap CG stunts
unrealistic explosions from cars and motorcycles
inconsistent bullet physics
main character reloaded a pistol once in the entire movie, picked up a new set of guns, never reloaded again
inconsistent blood spatter with certain gunshot wounds
recycled the same ideas and some of the lines from the first movie

Overall:
1 out of 5, i demand a refund of $3.99 from Writer and Director, Paul W. S.

5353251,1,B009MO5960,"Resident Evil: Retribution

As a huge RE fan, I've often defended the films among my friends, but after seeing RE: Retribution, I just stopped bothering. I have rarely seen such a lousy film. I was so pumped about seeing it in the theater, then I saw it in the crowded theater of 9 people on opening day, and I was sorely tempted to get my money back.

Now, I will say this, it is the continuity (or lack thereof) with the previous films that makes this movie so bad. On it's own, if you haven't seen any of the past films, you might not think it's as bad, although you may be confused.

-The acting is okay, no complaints really, just a terrible story
-Paul W.S. Anderson can't seem to make up his mind about where he wants the series to go, and at this point, he's just spewing out generic garbage that makes his wife (Milla Jovovich)/him more money.
-The movie is completely riddled with plot holes. I could go on for days about how many there are. I will some of the big ones I noticed:

1. No explanation as to what happened to the Redfields/ how Alice wound up underground
2. At some point during the apocalypse, the survivors managed to build a giant wall around the White House
3. Paul W.S. Anderson once again gave Alice back her powers after taking them away in the last film after giving them to her in the film before that (can't make up his mind)
4. There are now survivors holding out in the White house fort that Alice somehow missed when she was scouring the Earth for survivors in the last film
5. The Red Queen computer (the one that got fried in the first film) (the one that got replaced by the White Queen in the third film) is now the villain trying to kill all the survivors by making even more mutants (Let's face it, they stopped being zombies ages ago.) The same computer whose sole job was containing a zombie outbreak.
6. Wesker is now a good guy/ the president? No explanation of why or how that came to be, or why he couldn't stop the Red Queen alone since he is invincible
7. Alice knows who Ada Wong is...somehow.
8. The three Umbrella soldiers from the previous films are back, and it is revealed there are multiple clones of them. Though for some reason only three of them don't have helmets? Oh, and the good Rain was completely pointless.
9. The Umbrella soldiers outfits changed drastically...again.
10. Leon and the team kill hundreds of the Las Plagas zombies in the Russia dome, but when Rain injects herself with Las Plagas, she is invincible?
11. Why is the ""Urban Dome"" not just called Raccoon City? We flat out see a downed news helicopter that says Raccoon City on it

Overall, this movie just feels insulting. They obviously cared nothing about the plot, so why should we? They brought back the cooler characters from the previous films as if that would draw us into seeing it. It just feels cheap. I wouldn't spend a cent on this film, even to complete my collection. If you are looking for a good RE film, watch Resident Evil: Damnation that came out around the same time.",1356652800,,3020,4.414721723518851
5353252,5,B009MO5960,I didn't care too much for the other films in the series. The first movie was okay but others just seemed like action with no story and didn't stick much to the plot of the game. This should be called Resident Evil Redemption because this movie redeemed the entire series. The characters in the movie actually act like they do in the game. At first it seems like Jill's character is over the top and cheesy but then you start to realize that her character in the games is over the top and cheesy so she actually came out just right. The action in this movie was much better than the previous one where there was action that was closer to the video game and of course plenty of zombies. It does leave you wanting to see more especially with the ending.,1356652800,,751,4.295774647887324

5353264,4,B009MO5960,"More action, more visual effects and it's humanity's last stand in the fifth ""Resident Evil"" film, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"".

Directed and written by Paul W.S. Anderson (""Mortal Kombat"", ""Death Race"", ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Resident Evil""), the fifth film would take a different approach from previous films by tying loose ends with past characters but also focusing on creating a film primarily for 3D.  And like the previous ""Resident Evil"" films, the ""Retribution"" would go on to make over $221 million in the box office.

Not surprising since the ""Biohazard""/""Resident Evil"" video games have been quite popular since 1996 and there seems to be no stopping this juggernaut franchise to end anytime soon.  That goes the same with its live action film series which is loosely-based on the video games.

And no matter how film critics respond, the audience still turn out for the films and with ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" which was shown in theaters in 3D, once again the film continues to show that fans and audiences still love the action-driven series.  And to make sure there is a connection between the films, producer/writer Paul W.S. Anderson (""Death Race"" films, AVP: Alien vs. Predator"") returns as director.  Glen MacPherson (""Rambo"", The Final Destination"", ""Romeo Must Die"") is director of photography and music is by tomandandy (""Natural Born Killers"", ""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""The Rules of Attraction"").

VIDEO:

""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film features awesome contrast, amazing detail with natural skin tones, black levels are nice and deep.  The film is vibrant and looks very impressive on Blu-ray.  From Milla Jovovich's blue eyes to the detail of the zombies and monsters is fantastic!

By watching this fourth film, it appears that Paul W.S. Anderson may have wanted to include a lot of the video game elements, especially the horrific characters to this film.  In fact, the Umbrella Japanese soldiers looked as if they were inspired by the anime series ""Jin-Roh"".  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the overall look of the film especially how they improved the look of the horrific characters and the detail they put into those characters.  From the things coming out of the zombie's mouth or the various zombie monsters that are featured throughout the film, everything looked great for this film, the visual effects were amazing and looked great on Blu-ray!

It's important to note that there is a Blu-ray 3D version of ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" available.  If you have a 3D-enabled Blu-ray player and TV, you may want to check out the 3D Blu-ray release of ""Resident Evil: Retribution"".

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

When it comes to the ""Resident Evil"" film series, I felt that ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is the film that sounds the best and has a lossless soundtrack that is immersive. Presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital  and comes with an English - Audio Description Track, the lossless soundtrack for ""Retribution"" is fantastic!

LFE is used for explosions, surround channels are well utilized for the many action scenes in the film but how it uses ambiance and also directional sounds on the surround channels.

All I can say is that if you enjoyed the action-paced style of """"Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" and ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"", you're going to enjoy ""Retribution"" as this film is full of action-sequences that just keeps going and going and literally, this is a lossless soundtrack that really does take advantage of all channels in your home theater.  I was impressed!

You can expect bullets whizzing, hitting and flying everywhere through your surround channels, explosions and booms, sword cutting and a nice touch of LFE and it's continuous.  There is so much action in this film that it's literally designed for the audiophile in mind.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to ""Resident Evil"", I'm a hardcore fan of the video game series.  Owning nearly ever game that has been released since 1996 but when it came to the first film, I admit that at first, I wasn't digging it at all. I disliked how much of a departure the film was to the video games.  Granted, things always have to change between video game and movie adaptations but the problem was its screenplay. It was too different from what I was accustomed to.

But then came ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" and I really enjoyed the film and how it had elements of ""Resident Evil 2 (video game) incorporated to the film.  But for some reason, ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" felt like it was a step back.  And with the fourth film,  ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" was a mixed bag.

My main criticism was that although the visual effects were great, the action was focused on too much that the film really didn't have much of a storyline.

Here we are now with the fifth film ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" and I figured that for filmmaker Paul W.S. Anderson, if the films were popcorn action films, people keep coming back.  Why deviate from that?

And sure enough, this fifth film was all visual effects, showcasing fight choreography that looked amazing and action that was non-stop.  Sure, there were breaks to fit in a storyline but as the film was kicking off, for the first 20 or so minutes, I was wondering if there was going to be much dialogue.

But for what it's worth, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" delivers in surprises and twists.  Not only do the past cast members from a films return but also the introduction of ""Resident Evil"" favorites, Leon S. Kennedy (which Johann Urb fit the look of Leon quite well) and Chinese actress Li Bingbing as the sexy Ada Wong.

But while we saw the return of Jill Valentine (which fans have been waiting for) and even the return of Rain, Luther and Albert Wesker, the film forgot about Clair Redfield (portrayed by Ali Larter), K-Mart (portrayed by Spencer Locke) and Chris Redfield (portrayed by Wentworth Miller).  It felt weird because all four were seen on the same freighter at the end of ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" and while a clip from the last film was shown, no sign of any of them in this film. So, maybe they will show up in the next ""Resident Evil"" film.

And while I'm not a big fan of popcorn action films that focus on too much action and not enough story, I did enjoy ""Resident Evil: Retribution because of the inclusion of the new characters.  Although, I'm not sure about how I feel of this clone storyline (since it was never part of the original video games), Paul W.S. Anderson leaves viewers with an intriguing teaser at the end of the film that makes me look forward to sixth films.  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure if there is any finale to ""Resident Evil"",  like its video game counterpart, as long as the series continues to make money, you can expect more RE films in the near future.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" looks fantastic in HD!  The detail is amazing but there are a lot of use of green screen and visual effects in order to make this film more exciting in 3D.  The lossless audio for this film is also immersive and sounds fantastic in HD and there are plenty of special features included on the Blu-ray release as well.  I was surprised to learn how things have changed when it comes to stuntwork when it comes to filming in 3D.  Because in order to make things look realistic, actors will need to actually hit and not miss during their fighting scenes.

Actress Milla Jovovich explained how much training she had for many action films that she had starred in and how she was trained to miss during a fight scene, but this is the first time where she had to hit the people she was fighting because it had to look good in 3D and it was difficult for her.  Also, there is a scene with a car running through a truck and catching on fire.  I thought that would be done by CG but Anderson wanted to shoot an actual vehicle catching on fire during an actual jump through a truckbed.

So, director Paul W.S. Anderson and the producers really went all out in making this fifth film and its action scenes bigger and better and while the film looks a bit to CG for me, since a lot of it does take place inside an Umbrella base, there was part of me that was still longing for the good balance of storyline and action as seen in the second and third films.  But once again, as long as people are still coming out for this film, even if it's now more for its popcorn action and 3D effects, I guess for what its all worth, if that was the goal, they succeeded.

Again, just a reminder that this film is also being released on Blu-ray 3D, so if you have the hardware to showcase 3D, definitely go for it!  Otherwise, this Blu-ray release is solid and fans of the film series who love action, zombies, monsters and the action scenes that ""Resident Evil"" films are known for will enjoy this film.

Overall, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is an exciting popcorn action film that delivers in special effects and continuous action.  The film may not be known for a deep or involving plot and its similarities to the video games are non-existent aside from character names or titles, but this fifth film was quite fun because of its wild action and the return of many past characters from the ""Resident Evil"" films.  And as for the Blu-ray release, awesome picture quality, fantastic lossless audio and many special features makes this film worth owning in HD if you are fan of the film series!",1356566400,3,11584,4.8433367243133265

5353273,3,B009MO5960,"I remember way back in 2002 when the first Resident Evil movie came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action/Horror film.

Then along came Resident Evil: Apocalypse (RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to Alexander Witt...and you saw Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.

In 2007 the series returned to straight-up Action/Horror with Resident Evil: Extinction (RE3). RE3 never got as dark and creepy as RE1, but it was a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit Highlander?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.

Paul Anderson returned in 2010 to the Writer/Director's chair for Resident Evil: Afterlife, and he continued with the straight-up Action/Horror format. There were good old fashioned scares, a ton of action and the story never got boring. The acting and action were often clich and over the top, but it was all good.

And in 2012 Anderson held onto the reins for Resident Evil: Retribution, but this time a word of warning: If you're a gamer (especially if you've played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RE5/dp/B002Z7BE24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RE5</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RE6/dp/B0050SXLQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RE6</a>), you'll probably like Retribution...maybe even a lot. On the other hand, casual movie goers will likely want their own retribution after watching this latest in the franchise series.

The 2012 film is VERY videogame-esque. The characters need to escape an underwater/underground facility where they encounter various levels that they must get through often with video game bosses to beat in order to get to the next chapter. It was like watching long video game cutscenes, but when the action started you don't get to play...you still just sit and watch. Like its predecessors, Retribution has tons of action, but it's much lighter on the scares, and like I said earlier, the whole 'escape from the facility' concept may have made a great video game in the series but it only left me yearning for my PS3 controller. Perhaps too much time was devoted to the 3D stuff that for DVD viewers like myself wasn't part of the equation. Retribution was fair, but I suppose it was better with the 3D action eye-candy.

It's certainly not necessary to watch all the movies in chronological order to understand what's going on in the individual releases. But if you're into the Action/Horror genre, and you haven't seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-first/dp/B000MPEIF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the first</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Afterlife/dp/B004DTXJ4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Afterlife</a>, I'd recommend starting from there. If you like those two, then you have Retribution if you've got to have more. None in the series have topped the 2002 original.",1356566400,,3270,5.830543933054393

5353291,4,B009MO5960,"Resident Evil-Retribution(released Sept/12)stars everyone's fave kick butt babe,Milla Jovovich,as Alice. She's back this time in a wonderful non stop romp that,I think,is about on an equal par with the first one,that first introduced us all to this bizarre world. Milla is in top form and there are alot of former stars/characters back to reprise their roles and give the film an even bigger boost.
The film starts out where the last left off,on board the ship full of refugees with incoming VTOLs. The film starts with a twist,by having Milla thrust into the water and going down,then reversing the action/film until the point at which we see just why she landed in the water(being thrown over by a crash landing VTOL).
She wakes up in a suburban environment where she is married and has a deaf child. As they have their breakfast they are attacked by zombies and all but the daughter(who hides)are killed. Milla next wakes up in an Umbrella Corp.facility and is being questioned from an observation room by her old friend Jill Valentine(Sienna Guillory),who is being controlled through a spider like device implanted on her chest. Suddenly the controlling computer system goes into restart and the doors to her chamber open. She escapes into a controlled environment of the city of Tokyo and a simulation is run by the computer. Surviving that she comes into the control room to find everyone of the techs shot. As she examines a firearms cache,Ada Wong(Li Bingbing)joins her. Then her old nemesis Albert Wesker(Shawn Roberts)comes up on monitors. It seems Ada is working for him and neither belong to the Umbrella Corp.,who are planning to take over the Earth. Wesker believes the only chance the planet has of survival is with Milla's help. At the moment they are in an old expanded USSR submarine pen facility far below the surface in eastern Russia. The Umbrella Corp.has created several different simulated environments to test their human-like creations reactions to their bio hazard creations. Milla,with Ada's help,must travel through these environments and meet up with the rescue team.
As Ada and Milla work their way through a New York simulation the rescue team arrives and are on their way down to enter the Moscow simulation. There they are set upon by zombie soldiers. Milla and Ada finally team up with the rescue group and they make their way slowly back to the elevators. Before they can all get moving the power quits. The Red Queen,the facility controlling computer entity from the first film,now controls the entire Umbrella Corp.,and tries to stop the rescue in earnest. Jill,along with other controlled people,are there to stop Milla and the group also. Added to this is a giant Licker who grabs Milla's deaf daughter and whom Milla will take time to retrieve. Finally the group,lessened by a couple of deaths,reaches the surface and awaits their helicopter rescue. Explosives,the group left behind,are detonated and the complex below implodes.
A sub from below breaks through the ice and Jill and Rain(Michelle Rodriguez)emerge with Ada in custody. The two men left,battle Rain,who dispatches both,and Milla barely survives her fight by removing the spider like controller on her chest. Milla battles Rain and is losing badly when she spots a zombie just below the ice's surface. As Rain stands in one spot Milla fires her machine gun in a circle around her,which drops her into the water,and the zombies take care of her.
The rescue helicopter arrives and whisks Milla,Ada,Jill and Milla's deaf ""daughter"" to the White house. There in the president's chair sits Wesker. He injects her with the controlling Las Plagas parasites,enhancing her abilities to their former glory. Wesker says she will need it in the upcoming battle against the Umbrella Corp.and its hordes of T-Virus infected mutants.
This film is off and running from the first frame and never stops. The special effects,the fight sequences and CGI are all top notch,along with a good and swift moving plot. Milla is always a delight as Alice and her stunt work and fighting skills are all on display throughout. She is ably assisted,as I mentioned earlier,by several stars from the earlier films in this franchise. The only part one might question,as far as continuity goes,is Wesker's appearance,who I thought got blown up in a VTOL fleeing the ship last time out.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound here with deleted scenes,outtakes,commentaries,and featurettes.
All in all one of the best of the Resident Evil films so far. The action just flies from one scene to another and Milla is at her RE best throughout.

I went onto read a review from someone that truly loves both the movies and the games, they loved it.  I thought it was fun, interesting and an excellent set up for the next installment in the series.  i will buy this one as I have the others.  The story line is a bit hit or miss but if you relax the movie does come to you eventually.  If you accept the premise of where they are you will not get lost or have any real confusion of why you are seeing characters from the past in the present.  Nice to see old friends (still love Michelle Rodriguez).

5353308,4,B009MO5960,"Resident Evil: Retribution is the fifth film of the Resident Evil franchise.  Unfortunately, it continues in the path of the fourth film and further reduces the importance of plot; it now has only the minimum amount of plot and character development necessary to move the action forward.  This is really disappointing considering the first three films actually had substance and characters the viewer could actually begin to care about.  Side characters are now introduced and discarded without even trying to garner any emotional response from the viewer.  However, the movie is basically non-stop action, very intense action.  It definitely leaves nothing wanting in that regard.  I would have to give the movie a 3/5 rating.

While the movie itself leaves the viewer wanting more, the Blu Ray transfer will leave everyone satisfied.  It may be the finest Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen.  Unlike previous Blu Rays in the franchise, blacks are inky black throughout, whites are nice and bright.  Crush is never an issue either, giving the film a very natural and intense contrast.  Colors are nicely saturated and rich, with the overall color tone being a little cool.  There is an absolutely striking amount of fine detail, more than I would have thought possible out of 1080p resolution.  There is no grain or noise present.  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is also spectacular.  All channels are fully utilized throughout, including the subwoofer.  The soundstage consistently envelopes the audience.  It has great dynamic range and with the right setup will shake the walls, yet everything remains clear.  Easily a 5/5 rating for the Blu Ray.

Averaging out 3/5 for the movie and 5/5 for the Blu Ray leads to an overall 4/5 rating.  If you are a fan of the zombie action genre or the Resident Evil franchise in particular, I highly recommend this Blu Ray.  If you aren't necessarily a fan of the genre and don't really concern yourself with how good any particular Blu Ray looks, you should probably pass on this film.  If you are somewhere in between, then I hope I've given you a good idea of what to expect.",1356393600,2,2123,4.904494382022472

All and all this may not be for everyone but the role Alice took in this movie is fantastic, while meeting a few characters that are well known from the Resident Evil Franchise.

I do however believe they should have waited to bring in Ada Wong into the movie, just because I felt the actor didn't fit Ada. But don't take my word for it but at least I gave it a chance. Leon's character wasn't too bad either. I guess we'll have to see how they finally ""end"" this franchise with the next movie.

Also it explains very well why most of the older characters are back, so don't think otherwise. It makes complete sense once you watch it rather than ""assume"" their alive.",1356393600,2,810,4.253246753246753

I have a question for those of you who wrote negative reviews:  Were you expecting the works of Shakespeare when you watched this movie?

The previous installment looked absolutely horrible in the trailers and I went into it fully expecting it to be awful.  Given those expectations, it far exceeded my worst fears and it actually was horrible, but I loved every single second of it.  (Especially the shower fight scene.)

<< SPOILERS AHEAD >>

With this one, I expected even worse and it delivered triumphantly.  I really enjoyed this one.  I loved seeing Carlos and Rain back.  I hated seeing Luther die at the end, most likely permanently this time.  I wish they could've brought more characters back.  LJ was a great character and lived through the entire book series.

Then director went to Moscow to shoot a couple of scenes on subway and here you have Retribution.
All previous RE movies were not strong on plot side. But Retribution made no sense whatsoever. In fact, it appears as if director(s) are deliberately testing the limits of what public would consume. It all stops just a tad short of Mila Jovovich literally telling us, the public, that we are stupid to pay for watching this.

5353352,2,B009MO5960,"I'll start by saying that I have watched all the previous movies in the franchise.  Like many of the reviewers here, I agree that that this was, by far, the worst of the lot.

Action movies have a long and storied history of poor plots and little sense and the Resident Evil series is proudly no different.  Sadly, this has really gone to the extreme here.  I'm guessing that the director just figured if he had nonstop explosions, gunfire, and cleavage, nobody would notice the horrendous plot holes.  I'll admit, the cleavage was why I gave this movie the second star.  Yay cleavage!

Otherwise, I might have missed it, but during the great escape sequence, they all have to get off the elevator, because the power has been shut off.  The elevator is their only way to escape, so they're summarily humped, unless they get it powered up again.  The good guys stand around trying to figure out how to get it fixed.  Cue the bad guys to show up and gunfire ensues.  Good guys go running everywhere, saving people and shooting back.  Suddenly the elevator has power again, for no apparent reason, allowing the remaining good guys to survive.  Lame.  No explanation, no hacking the mainframe, no hot wiring, no reconfiguring the deflector array to emit a phase tachyon pulse, no recalculating the flux capacitor to emit 1.21 gigawatts, nothing.  It just works again.

Or the chick in the slinky red dress.  She has a gun strapped to her thigh in one scene, where the good guys are trapped in a house.  No other guns in sight, the dress definitely would have revealed any other weapons.  Suddenly a firefight breaks out and she now hands Milla her one gun and yet now has a pistol in either hand.  Sure, it always looks cool in a movie to be firing two guns, but magically appearing guns is a bit hard to believe.  I won't go into the inexhaustible supplies of ammunition, but these guys would have needed a truck to follow them around, keeping them constantly supplied with bullets.  Unless they were carrying all those extra bullets in their cleavage.  I hadnt thought of that.  Multipurpose.

And then theres the final fight scene, out of the underwater soviet testing facility, up on the frozen-over lake above.  The good guys are making their escape in their sno cat, trekking scross the ice.  They are forced to stop and have yet another fight.  The only way to stop one of the bad people is to fire a bunch of bullets into the ice at her feet, breaking the ice and sending her into the freezing, nazi-zombie infested waters below.  I don't know, but I'm guessing a sno cat which can carry a group of people probably weighs a couple tons.  Firing some bullets into ice thick enough to support that kind of weight probably wouldnt do squat.  Not to mention, the unstoppable evil chick has a punch that crushes people's sternums and kills them in one blow.  She also gets hit in the face with a metal fire extinguisher, swung by a fairly large individual.  She doesnt even blink.  So why did her fight against two of the good guys go on for ten minutes?

Sadly, this is yet another hollywood insult to people around the world.  If you add enough explosions nobody will notice the gaping plot holes and weak story.

I won't delve into the horrible acting, you're watching a Resident Evil movie, don't expect Oscar moments.

There are quite a few other ridiculous moments, such as the grapple gun which apparently has limitless cable.  The almost instantaneous results of the T virus, whereas it took quite awhile in the prior movies to effect results.  The completely ludicrous concept of building an entire mockup of new york, tokyo, berlin, and moscow, ostensibly for testing purposes.  We have an artifical intelligence that runs an antire corporation/evil empire that plans on eradicating humanity, but it cant run simulations without plywood sets and clones?

This is a over budget B movie, compared to the other RE films, the effects suck and are down right visible at nearly every stage.
The producers should to taken out back and beaten for this tragedy. Or better yet, forced to watch all the movies before this one then make them watch this movie.
 In time i will own this just to have the complete collection.
After this i think the series has been over done and over worked.
Watch it to finish the series yes. Buy it, only if you have to, to complete your collection.

5353360,1,B009MO5960,"I hate to say this but do yourself a big favor and avoid this movie at all costs.  I meant to see this in the theater since I'm a huge fan of the series, bought them all on DVD then blu-ray, but it only lasted a week or so in town before it was removed so I had to wait until the blu-ray release, so I've been anxiously waiting to finally watch it.  I should've rented it instead of pre-ordering.  Talk about one of the biggest disappointments in cinematic history, and a huge waste of my time and money.

I watched this tonight with a friend of mine who's also a big fan of the series, and sadly we were laughing our way through this film at all the unintentionally funny scenes that were simply too cheesy or ludicrous even for this series.  It took about half an hour into it before it began making even a semblance of any sense, but even then there were still enough plot holes to fill the Titanic.

I haven't played the games hardly at all, so I came into this series because it looked intriguing but I didn't have any pre-conceived notions of what they should be like or about, whereas most of the games' fans dislike the films because they're not close to the game story-line at all.  I came in with an open mind and I've been pleasantly surprised by all of these movies, up until this one.  I even researched the Internet Movie Database to try to figure out what the heck happened to take a popular, well-established franchise and then completely screw up the story, but I haven't really found any answers other than seeing that my voice isn't alone on this.

There's really no character development to speak of, which there was plenty of in the previous films.  There are numerous old characters that come back for no apparent reason, it's explained but it serves little purpose other than tarnishing the memory of their original characters.  It seriously feels like Paul Anderson spent five minutes on writing this 'script' just to quickly cash in on its popularity, because it really doesn't hold a candle to the previous plot lines, characters, dialogue or intrigue.  The plot in 'Retribution' is so convoluted it makes 'Crime & Punishment' look succinct by comparison.

About the only redeeming features of the film is the HD cinematography and many of the action sequences.  There are quite simply too many things that are deus ex machina, essentially factors thrown in at random with no discernible explanation for how they came to be.  Granted this series requires a major amount of suspending one's disbelief but it came to the point where it made James Bond movies look plausible.  There were (what looked like) Nazi zombies riding jeeps and zombies from the deep, homages perhaps to old B-movie slasher flicks of the 70s and 80s but completely out of context for this series.

It's the first movie of this series where I didn't care one way or the other of how any of it would turn out, or what happened to any of them, because there was no reason to.  The movie moved aimlessly all over the map with no end in sight, and not all that entertaining, either.

To make matters worse, the ending was beyond stupid.  Completely nonsensical, over-the-top B-movie ending, with no logical addition to the series.  In terms of cliff-hangers, this one 'jumped the shark', so to speak, in other words it's so completely out of sync with the overall story that it boggles the mind and almost begs to be put out of its misery.

How this movie came to be without a serious re-write or questioning by studio-execs will forever remain a mystery (perhaps there is an answer out there, I'd really like to know), or it was simply just out to make a quick buck, of course, but even that doesn't really answer it because the others were huge money makers AND were quite well made, by the same writer/director/producer, no less.  Sadly this will be the last of this series that I will buy without seeing it first, and if there are any more, which Anderson has said there will be, I will definitely only rent it this time around, because this was an unfortunate waste of my time and money and I won't bother to see it again, it's that bad.  Huge, huge disappointment, all the way around, it's really hard to believe it was made by the same guy.  I kind of suspect he hired a ghost writer for this script and just put his name on it, because the difference in quality is night and day.

On the bright side I'll take comfort in the fact that I can re-watch the first 4 films on blu-ray and I'll just pretend that this epic failure of a film wasn't made.",1356220800,29,4547,4.49453219927096

Everyone is so corny cool. People fire guns without squinting, they get tossed around in rain/snow and their hair is perfect, no sweat .. the stuff that makes you believe someone went through stress/strain. The ridiculous wide leg stance/posture of the actresses, the corny lines the guys had. And did I mention the 'acting-in-bottle' acting? I guess Hollywood is milking it for its worth. Glad I didn't pay movie prices to see this.. maybe movie directors will get the message if theaters are empty when they show us this crap.",1356134400,2,705,4.648
5353363,2,B009MO5960,"No plot worth deciphering.  No character worth caring about.  A repeat of just about everything of interest in the previous movies, only out of context, unsurprising, uninspiring. From the previous movies, did you like the Red Queen?  Got'er, but washed out and dull.  Did you like the hall of lasers?  Got it, except no one gets hurt (if that spoils your movie, get a life.  Seriously).  Michelle Rodriguez's two facial expressions?  Well you get one of them.  The flip flying fighting, shooting, and slo mo bullets?  Got it X 10.  It is so Matrixy CGI, even the live actors look computer generated.  Topped off towards the by an endless chop-stick, flying, flipping CGI Kung Fu fightfest that only does one thing: it makes you appreciate the subtlety of Kill Bill's Kung Fu fights.

How bad was this movie?  Honestly, I can't fully plum it's depths, I kept nodding off.  My 9 year-old son kept waking me up until he started playing video games with his smartphone during the last half of the movie.  And, we like the RE series!  It was so dumb and dull he said we should not keep the disc for our RE collection.  Like he says, name a good fourth movie in a series.  What a ridiculous waste of money, talent, and computer bytes.  This high end of the action movie action is reaching(ed) the point of CGI saturation.  It's boring.

Oh, and the most jaw-dropping part of the movie is it ends with a set up for a sequel.  Not a subtle open ended ending, but five minutes that will be the first five minutes of the next movie.",1356134400,2,1523,4.478102189781022
5353364,4,B009MO5960,"Tough, beautiful women. Big guns. Things getting blown up. Macho guys. Monsters scary enough to make you soil your pants. Deadly gadgets. Yeah, it's a Resident Evil movie.  And just in case you've spent the last two decades in a coma, this movie franchise was inspired by Capcom's video game of the same name that was originally released on the Sony Playstation console in 1996.  It was one of the original survival-horror games that defined that genre, along with the likes of Silent Hill and Parasite Eve.  Now, here we are living in the Playstation 3 generation and the Resident Evil video game franchise continues to delight players with each new edition.  And the movie franchise never fails to scare viewers with each new sequel.

The story takes place at the Umbrella Corporation's main underground research and testing center, located in the frozen north of Russia.  This is where the giant business entity took prospective clients in order to demonstrate the power of their new bio-weapons.  The underground facility consists of very realistic environmental recreations, complete with disposable human clones.  Both were designed in order to be able to not only run simulations, but also to provide a controlled environment on which to demonstrate the effects of the T virus on an urban setting.  This is where clients such as Russia, the U.S., China, Japan, and their respective governments viewed the simulations prior to signing away lots of money to Umbrella.

Having been knocked unconscious on the deck of the container ship from the last movie, Alice wakes up to find herself in a holding cell.  Through the interventions of Ada Wong and Albert Wesker, Alice manages to escape her prison cell.  Ada tells her that Albert Wesker no longer works for Umbrella.  What's left of the giant corporation is now under the control of the Red Queen.  The remaining employees now take their orders directly from the corporation's supercomputer and its artificial intelligence network.  Wesker, the former CEO, has sent Ada to help Alice escape from the massive underground facility.  He had arranged for a team of mercenaries, led by Leon S. Kennedy, to meet with them near the exit and take them out of the country.  The problem, and there is always a problem, is that the Red Queen will do everything in her power to keep Alice from getting away.  If you have been a fan of the franchise, you will recall that Alice has special abilities that the corporation would like to further research.  Red Queen activates and releases all of her bioweapons in order to stop Alice and Ada from escaping.

Along the way, franchise favorites make their appearance in one form or another.  Johann Urb and Binbing Li play their parts, Leon and Ada.  Sienna Guillory returns as Jill Valentine.  Oded Fehr, Michelle Rodriguez, Colin Salmon, Shawn Roberts, and Boris Kodjoe return to reprise their roles.  And ofcourse, that adorable franchise mainstay, the Licker, is back.  And this time, much larger and much more powerful than in the past.  Toss in a couple of sack-masked, axe-wielding Tyrant T-103s into the mix for good measure.  And the Las Plagas parasite just to spice things up and you have got yourself non-stop action.  Over-the-top, if you ask me.  But fun to watch nevertheless.

This is a must-see for anyone who is interested in the continuing saga that is Resident Evil.  This is perhaps the best movie to come out of the franchise.  A lot of people who have not kept up with the series will probably come back just to see Michelle Rodriquez back in on the action.  And they will not be dissapointed.  She plays a much bigger, dual-role in this movie.  Lots of chick fight in this one.  And Milla Jovovich, along with Kate Beckinsale and Angelina Jolie, have proven herself to be just as capable an action star as the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li.  The woman even did most of her own stunts in the first RE movie.  She looks good in her black, skin-tight outfit.  And we finally get to see Alice go up against a parasite-infected Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), which could be the chick fight of this year's cinema.

I rented my movie at XBox.  I also frequently rent from the Playstation network.  I could just as easily have watched it on Amazon.  There are no shortages of how to get your movies these days.  Still, I am considering buying the Blu-Ray version.  There really is no substitute for owning the actual media and having it in your library.",1356134400,3,4467,4.8120893561103815

Let me say this up front.. Both my husband and I are HUGE Resident Evil fans. While this series may not have been top notch as far as acting, directing and script up until this last chapter, the previous films were high in entertainment value, fun, full of action and well delivered for ""being what it is."" No one walks into one of these movies expecting perfection; this is the Zombie Apocalypse, not Shakespeare! But at LEAST make the storyline somewhat entertaining and believable. This last film is an utter embarrassment! The acting was HORRID and in my opinion, this was a result of a bad script and terrible direction. Even the CG was crappy.

The opening is just badass and the creatures look fantastic.

The story is pretty good, with lots of action, and a wide variety of zombies. This one is a little different than the others because the story take place underwater, which is a nice fresh take and returns to its roots by once again being underground.

First of all let me start by saying there is no hearing impaired person I know of that can speak that good so that bugged me from the gate, second I don't by the actress cares at all for the kid in the least not to mention there was no character development at all. The kid could have been killed off at any point and I would not have cared less, the sad thing is that goes for every last person in this movie, you just don't care about the characters in the least (at least I couldn't) and I found it hard to get into it because of that.

It has nothing to do with the original Resident Evil!
Just because the non-gamers think they can be a part of it and do not check, they just sell the movie under the name.

The characters and monsters are totally placed wrong.

And the Alice character is like a porn actress who is a wannabe supergirl and pretend to be cool.
In fith element she was cool, but Resident Evil characters has to be mortals, understatement to create horror, not to create action with enemies from a horrorgame.

For all movie-people, there is a fact. When the Las Plagas was found in the game, Umbrella was allready destroyed.

5353400,1,B009MO5960,"Retribution: A punishment that is considered to be morally right and fully deserved.  That's the generally accepted definition of the word.  Which would lead one to believe that somewhere in the movie, someone, for some ""morally right"" reason, is being punished.  What the movie fails to address, however, is that the only people being punished are the viewers of this film.  An interesting titular meta-reference, but not a very interesting movie.

Paul W. S. Anderson, presumably a 12 year old child with ADD and enormous financial resources, sat down with other cinema-minded individuals and began the painstaking process of pre-production for this film, which, based on the result, consisted of watching other hyperactive 6th graders play video games for five hours at a stretch.  Convinced he could bring some of that magic to the big screen, he then proceeded to set up a conference call with Uwe Boll and Michael Bay to discuss their own techniques for having the worst possible acting and dialogue interspersed with frenetic shots of people back-flipping over exploding cars while they fired machine guns with inexhaustible ammunition capacities in order to escape from a hi-tech installation for some reason.  ""Paul,"" they said, while riffling through the stacks of thousand-dollar bills they have lying about their Lake Como retreats, ""that sort of thing has been done before, countless times, probably to the point of weariness.""

""Ha Ha!,"" countered Paul, ""But has it been done with zombies?!""

""Yes,"" replied the filmmakers in unison.

""Well, too bad, I'm going to do it anyway.""  And then they all concluded the meeting by making gunfire and explosion noises with their lips.

To give you an idea of just how bad this movie is, consider for a second that Milla Jovovich, while by no means an unskilled actress, puts on a performance that is positively Oscar-worthy compared to the rest of the cast.  In fact, the little hearing-impaired girl who has 11 lines, out-acts everyone else by a factor of 10.  Based on the dialogue delivery, I honestly thought that at some point it was going to be revealed that all the characters in this film were, in actuality, robots programmed by a team of engineers that had learned the English language solely by watching middle-school drama productions.

In any case, Anderson had both the Random Cliche and Plot-Contrivance Generators running at full tilt, and when they ran out of steam, he compensated by lifting sequences directly from Dawn of the Dead, every John Woo movie ever made (minus the doves), and even other Resident Evil movies.  That's correct, he actually used footage from Resident Evil: Afterlife as filler in this one.  I suppose that's one way to shave off dollars from the budget.  Hiring a stoned teenager with a digital recorder and a stack of 1990's-era video games to compose the background music is another.  For the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought I had left a Playstation paused somewhere in the house.  Nope; that was the score.

So what is to become of this franchise?  The first Resident Evil movie was actually quite good, if you're into the genre.  Ditto the follow up and the third.  It's been pretty much a downhill slide since then, and this movie proves that with a little digging, there's another layer underneath rock-bottom.  And Anderson wielded a mighty big shovel with this one.  I'm honestly hoping that some other filmmaker (no, not Boll or Bay) can take over the reins and resurrect this series and bring us Resident Evil: Reparations.  I think the fans deserve better than this.

*Resident Evil: Retribution (2012)- 1.5/5

Resident Evil: Retribution is the 5th installment in the Resident Evil film series. It's based off the Resident Evil video game series, and is written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson for the 3rd time. The movie has many returning actors and characters, and the series introduces new characters from the video game. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is captured by the Umbrella Corporation, but escapes, and continues to hunt those responsible for the T-Virus outbreak.

For a movie series like Resident Evil, I try to watch every single movie again in the series before seeing the latest. I do this for many reasons including being able to fully review from the series. For Resident Evil: Retribution, I didn't watch the previous movies again before watching this film. From memory, I've never been a fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise, and I recall giving Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) a 3/5 (the highest rating in the series) when I saw it back in 2010. Simply put, Resident Evil: Retribution was a waste of my time and money.

For starters, the plot is very uninteresting and I didn't care what happened or who died. Secondly, the deaf child character bugged me; I've never seen a deaf person speak so well, and why are all of the characters acting like she can hear them without sign language? Thirdly, the acting is simply terrible. Fourthly, why are so many of the action scenes in slow-mo? In most movies I love when the action is slowed down, but when I don't care about the movie, it just makes it drag on even longer. Fifthly, I thought the film needed to explain itself a lot more. There are so many unanswered questions, it boggles my mind. Sixthly, there's so much action and not enough story. Lastly, this series has run its course, and unfortunately there's probably going to be another one on the way.

Now, there are some things I did like about Resident Evil: Retribution. The new gadgets are cool and the action scenes kick-ass. I really liked the opening credits, and while I saw the movie in 2D, I will recommend that you see it in 3D as there's plenty of cool 3D moments. Well, that about sums up the good parts about the movie. I'm not happy that I didn't watch the previous films again before watching Retribution, and when I watch the series over again, my rating and review might change, but I feel confident enough to write a review now. Overall, if you're a fan of this series, you'll probably like this new edition, but can you really take that much more? To the rest of you viewers, I have to give Resident Evil: Retribution a recommended 'must-pass.'",1353628800,5,2655,4.703225806451613

I absolutely HATE this trend of two- part movies and/or movies that leave you with an unsatisfying cliffhanger. All of the previous Resident Evil movies end with something of a cliffhanger but they also clearly have a strong plot and ending to them that hints at what is next to come. This movie was more of a lead in to the next in the series which looks AWESOME. Instead of making this a separate movie for a few more bucks, they should have made an extra long movie that combines this with the next in the series. There is not much of a plot and the trailers lead you to expect a much more exciting movie that simply does not deliver. It reminded me of a weak a term paper that is too wordy and has obviously been stretched to meet the length requirements for the assignment. At the end of the movie my only reaction was an indifferent shrug and the thought that I should have waited to watch it on video instead of rushing to see it on opening weekend.",1353369600,3,1079,4.242718446601942

5353407,2,B009MO5960,"I'm a RE fan. It's my ""go-to"" movie when I can't think of anything else to watch. Afterlife, while entertaining, was taking things a little too far. The effects were so-so in many places, and the clones bought the farm way too easily. The plot was decent, but something about the movie was really lacking. The first three were easy to ""Get in to"" - Afterlife not so much. I had high hopes for ""Retribution"" - these were left in tatters after the first 15 minutes. The effects were over-done, we don't need slow-mo for every scene, and many of the fight scenes were just pathetic and or idiotic. The ending was a massive letdown. Milla, who is usually sexy and energizing was half awake during much of the movie. It's almost as if she were stuck doing the flick, so made the most of it - but hated showing up for work. Her outfit has gone from kinky/sexy to retro ""there was a sale on buckles at the dollar store"" spandex. Who would have thought she could look so foolish in an outfit made up of a leather bodice, latex and metal? Ignoring the fact that nobody would ever wear that ridiculous getup. Society has collapsed. Yet she finds a custom made leather and stainless outfit? Sure, it's Umbrella - and they make some crazy outfits - but they are functional - this is just idiotic. The clones are supposed to be warriors. Yet instead of armor they get spandex and thin leather? Instead of protective plates, it's a bodice with huge hand-holds to grab. This is one reason the previous movies made more sense - her clothing looked like it was thrown together from stuff she found lying around and was functional. This is nothing but eye-candy. But then again, so is the movie.

5353408,2,B009MO5960,"What's it about?

With the help of a resistance movement, Alice must fight her way out of another evil underground Umbrella facility.

Is it any good?

Retribution starts where `Afterlife' left off; we see Alice on board the `Arcadia' tanker shooting her way through Umbrella bad guys in stylish reverse slow motion. As cool as this looks, it leaves a pretty clear indication that `Retribution' will continue the perilous downward spiral that began with `Afterlife'...zero story but bucket loads of slow-mo action. It seems Anderson has finally ran out of ideas...or maybe he just doesn't care. `Retribution' stars Milla Jovovich and absolutely nobody else worth remembering, as two more characters from the video game; Ada Wong (Li Bingbing) and Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb) are dropped into the series with absolutely no back story, and characters from past films in the series reappear only to serve as pointless bullet riddled clones. Remember when these films had characters with at least some diligence? `Retribution' may lack substance but it certainly makes up for it in style. The action is heavy and violent plus the 3D is insane, Anderson throws enough at the screen to keep you on the edge of your seat. Just like past films in the series, this movie really stimulates when the lovely Milla Jovovich dons the skin-tight black latex, sassy attitude and sub-machine gun; leaving men pleased and ushers displeased with cleaning up sticky aisles. `Retribution' may be action packed and heavy on the eye-candy but with each subsequent sequel I keep asking myself that question: ""what happened to my beloved Resident Evil series?"".

Best bit?

Alice as a suburban housewife is terrorised by a pack of hungry zombies.

Did you know?

This was the first movie in the series not to feature undead dogs.",1351987200,7,1805,5.0369127516778525
5353409,3,B009MO5960,"One of the biggest setbacks to following a film during its production is that there's to be little to no surprise in the final product after you've indulged yourself in the tidbits the actors and production like to give its fans. Fortunately and unfortunately, ""Resident Evil"" as a franchise has never been one for maintaining surprise (either as game or a film) and thus the only real drawback is knowing what order the scenes will happen.

[True to form, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" gets off to a promising start by picking up where ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-Afterlife/dp/B004DTXJ4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil: Afterlife</a>&nbsp;(2010)"" left of with the incursion of Umbrella gunships converging on the ship captured by Alice (Milla Jovovich), Claire (Ali Larter) and Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller).

However, instead of a straightforward action sequence, we get a literal flashback in reverse wherein Alice emerges from the icy waters of the Los Angeles bay and fails to fend off the hordes of Umbrella soldiers --- lead by Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) --- as they lay siege to the ship, killing and capturing all in their path. Alice reintroduces the story of the original, second, third and fourth films to us once more in a video confessional and the story begins again with Alice waking from a dream in a cushy bedroom, married to Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) with a deaf daughter named Becky (Aryana Engineer).

She lives the good life until their home is besieged by Las Plaga Undead in a scene straight out of Zack Snyder's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B002NWOI0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>&nbsp;(2004)"". She and her daughter manage to evade death long enough to encounter a suburban Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) who rescues them from the horde only to be blindsided by a truck. Alice later wakes up in a white room and is interrogated by a brainwashed Jill Valentine demanding to know why she betrayed Umbrella.

During a lull, the Umbrella facility she's being held in loses power and she is allowed the chance to escape, armed to the teeth with weaponry and a new outfit. On the outside she meets special agent Ada Wong (Li Bingbing, dubbed over by someone who is vaguely reminiscent of Ada's voice actress in ""Resident Evil 4"") who reveals to her who's pulling the strings of the clandestine biohazard operation.]

In the aftermath of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-Extinction/dp/B000YPUF9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil: Extinction</a>&nbsp;(2007)"" and ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" there were plenty of criticisms from the franchise's fanbase that these two entries into the franchise moved too slowly and suffered from ""too little action"" (or too much Alice brooding in silence) and ""too much talk"" if that's remotely possible for this franchise. There were of course promises to rectify this problem, but if ""Afterlife"" and ""Extinction"" are the equivalent of a zombie-action film that movies too slow, ""Retribution"" is the zombie-action film that drops too much and moves too fast for the sake of appeasing its audience.

Where dropping you into the middle of a story worked on some level in the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000MPEIF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;(2002)"", ""Retribution"" suffers from a lack of any kind of substantial background. Once Alice is freed from her imprisonment in the White Room, each scene following unfolds more like a series of music video sequences with some excellent fight choreography as opposed to the natural progression of scenes that compliment one after the other with a coherent narrative.

On top of that, there are elements that pertain to Alice and Ada being rescued from the underwater Umbrella base by the likes of Leon Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand), Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) and two nameless men destined for cannon fodder that was an un-shot portion of the film unto itself. Team ""Gorgeous Men with Guns"" were hired by Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) to infiltrate the Umbrella base and bring Alice back to the surface, but it's mentioned in passing and their introduction feels largely like a scene that was chopped down into almost nothing.

And that's what a great deal of this film feels like: A longer or at least mildly more substantial film than the one unfolding on the screen before our eyes that was clearly cut down for running time reasons. While the dialog was never a shining achievement in screenwriting, the chosen scenes in which our characters interact or merely exposition dump for sake of the remaining plot feel poorly chosen and directed, especially in comparison to previous endeavors of the franchise. Pacing moves at breakneck speed and thus decisions made in regards to the film's narrative tend to beg to the question ""Uh why did that just happen?""

For one instance, of all the people or things that could've taken control of and kept Umbrella running in the face of a global apocalypse and extinction of the human race, why the Red Queen? Why not William Birkin or someone else the video game placed into a position power beside Albert Wesker? The Red Queen as a antagonist doesn't work because we're never given a reason for her motivations let alone why she is even still alive after being nuked by the very company that created her (unless she's a 2.0 version of her program). Plus her presence simply begs the question that will never be answered, ""well, what happened to the White Queen?"" Is she still active in Nevada working on Alice's miracle Anti-Virus or was she deactivated? Why exactly are Albert Wesker and Ada Wong not working for Umbrella anymore? The Red Queen hardly seems like a challenge for someone who has apparently gained control of his superhuman abilities, let alone a plausible roadblock to deter him from doing whatever he wanted in the face of the world's extinction or better yet, fixing the problem as he seems intent on doing as President Albert Wesker (pause for effect).

How do Ada Wong and Leon Kennedy know each other, why does he trust her and so on and so forth? There's a whole unexplored element on the power of Umbrella's reach and the nature of how the clones are used and treated as test subjects that's glossed over. Becky, the daughter of ""Suburban Alice"" (a clone), brings up a rather interesting plot point in the story that is never used at all and sloppily executed.

It's clear that Anderson wanted to pay homage to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>"" with the relationship between Becky and Alice and it's nice to watch Jovovich and Aryana interact, but outside of some sweet and silly moments between the two, nothing really comes of it. It's normal things like that this I'm usually able to ignore because on some level Anderson never left them completely unanswered or at least covered the questions of the plot right in front of him better than this. The Red Queen just feels like a severe left turn into a wall as a result of writing oneself into a narrative rock and a hard place after removing your primary antagonist from the ""villain"" stable.

Another thing that really bothered me was how certain characters died, or rather, how they were utilized. The clones of ""One"" (Colin Salmon), Carlos and Rain are used to very little effect and are cameos at best. They speak infrequently and never really interact with each other on any level. Worst of all they end up dying in ways they reflect how unnecessary they were to the overall film. Their roles could've been filled in by any nameless mook and there would be little difference.

""Evil Rain"" is exploited as the primary boss battle in the climax of the film, spouting off awkward one-liners like ""I'm coming for you!"" while she beats the ever-loving crap out of Leon and Luther like they were mere punching bags. The only redeeming factor in how she's used is the truly fitting underwater death scene she gets. ""Good Rain"" was probably one of the highlights of the film, showcasing Rodriguez's 'feminine side' as she portrays a ""vegan eating, anti-gun protester"" that wears stiletto heels you never really see in the film.

Unfortunately the character is killed off just as soon as she begins to do anything in the film. The same happens with Barry Burton. The character is barely put to any good use before he's pointlessly killed off for a dramatic ploy that never pays off in the end because you never got to know him. I even had to question why the two nameless guys that followed Leon and co. were there. It was just so apparent that they weren't necessary that I ask again ""why are they there?"" There's no risk or drama involved for our protagonists, its obvious that these guys are going to die, but why do it so quickly? The minor characters in ""Afterlife"" were treated better than this. Boris Kodjoe's Luther West --- one of the best parts of ""Afterlife"" --- is used about as well as Barry and the returning dead characters.

His own death scene is so egregious and unimportant that I found myself grinding my teeth at the waste of such a capable and interesting character. After all that build up, that's what he gets (Carlos got a better send off in ""Extinction"")? Jill Valentine as the villain is underused as well, showcased in scenes with some truly stilted dialog that sounds spliced together and purposely distorted. The only saving grace in regards to her is that she also gets an impressive fight sequence with Alice and survives to possibly fall back into a useful character she was in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-Apocalypse/dp/B000I8ES70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;(2004)"".

Performances are for the most part okay; Li Bingbing and Johann Urb do serviceable jobs with the material given and truly embody the characters of Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong with what face time they're given in the movie, including that awkward romance angle that's barely touched upon in the games as well --- albeit in a throwaway scene that gets a chuckle or two. Milla Jovovich remains consistent as the super heroine Alice, throwing her physical everything into the roll with the ease of a practiced stuntwoman. At the same time she portrays a not-so-helpless scream queen soccer mom with just as much believability.

Kevin Durand on the other hand is barely given anything to work with as Barry. He does his 'best' with character quirks (cigars, crouching in the face of death and one liners), but he just comes off as the weak link in a franchise with above-average performances and you know this man can act (particularly when he's the antagonist of a film). Boris Kodjoe and Michelle Rodriguez keep an upbeat and steely consistency with their characters; Boris, however misused he was, is still a joy to watch as Luther, the basketball star turned hero and fleeting love interest for Alice. Michelle is at her most entertaining when she's fighting or playing the flip side of her machinegun touting warrior woman. I can believe her as a conservative young woman voting for gun control and refusing to eat food with a face.

Fight choreography, special and practical effects maintain their usual consistency (i.e., they were awesome). The use of popular BOWs like the Licker, Las Plagas and the Axeman (Executioner Majini) make for some fantastic action sequences, but they're unfortunately dispensed as easily as zombies. The hand-to-hand combat scenes are the best of the franchise. For once, you can see what's happening in the fight and it's clear that the actors (stunt people and production team) put their all into selling these fights as the genuine article, albeit stretched to the impossible lengths by movie logic. The film is beautiful to look at, the cinematography is at its strongest here since ""Extinction"". Even when the film shifts from on-location to studio shots the quality of the scenery remains consistent. However, its only mildly complemented by [IMAX] 3D which is used very little or so subtly that it's not always in your face until they want to spook the audience with something flying at the screen. On that level I can appreciate Anderson's ability to restrain hisself and not going overboard with the 3D like most directors tend to do. The only real flub I could complain about is the noticeable miniature set pieces used in wide shots. It was like looking at someone's homemade film with a sheet of Hollywood gloss. That little car toy and submarine were so painfully visible.

The score by tomandandy is something of a hit-and-miss; it's primarily a rehash of the ""Afterlife"" score and its popular themes (""Flying"" - ""Tokyo"" - ""Axman""), with only one strong reoccurring motif playing throughout the film (""Flying through the Air"") complimented by a grandiose piece that suits the half finale given before the movie truly ends (""Zombies Under Ice""). Otherwise the duo's score suits the frenetic pace of the film and does a serviceable job in the background.

Overall, despite my problems with ""Retribution"", I enjoyed watching this. As far an action/chase film goes, it excels in spades and never lets us on that level. Narratively, however, it's a dang mess. My opinion is of course subject to change as I've only just seen this movie a couple hours ago, but I did enjoy it even when I was continually asking ""why this"" and ""why that?"" If you're a fan of the Resident Evil Movieverse, then by all means check this out. If not, do please avoid it at all costs, you'll only give yourself a headache.

Resident Evil Retribution 3D Review: Even better 3D than RE: Afterlife

This movie plays with your head sort of like Inception did, never letting you really know what's going on till about midway when Alice is finally let in on the reality of the situation. A bit jarring at first, but very unique for a RE Film. That aside, the story is fairly basic, from point A to B with some side stories thrown in for good measure. Finally, this fifth RE movie does a nice job paying tribute to the previous RE films in many ways as you'll see, and hints clearly for a follow up film.

If you know the Resident Evil series, you'll know there's usually a heavy emphasis on full on action. Retribution lives up to the term ""Roller Coaster"" by providing nearly non-stop action, literally. Just when Alice (Milla Jovovich) finishes on action scene, another enemy shows up and attacks, leaving little room for story development in between. So think of it as a total @ss kicking action movie made for your entertainment along the lines of The Expendables 2 and you'll enjoy it.

The action sequences are incredible in terms of martial arts choreography (especially the opening attack on Alice in the white halls = amazing mix of roundhouse kicks, flipping, tossing, locking, cracking heads, chain flicking and shooting).
Then there's guns blazing every few seconds, Zombie attacks in the Suburbs, Las Plagas ""Smart shooting zombies from the RE 4 game"" confrontations in Moscow, fast speed car chases, stalking Licker monsters, giant butcher Axe Men attacks in the city, and an ending arctic fight scene that goes on for a glorious five minutes at least. All done with explosions, special FX and splattering blood better than before. Incredible action.

Milla Jovovich (Aice) and a number of returning members including Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) deliver their lines with a relaxed believability that comes off as genuine. The roles of Ada Wong and Jill Valentine however, are a bit robotic, perhaps intentionally but still mildly distracting, as they were/are under the control of Umbrella. Leon makes an appearance, but again, some of the delivery of his lines could have been more natural. Otherwise, well done.

TomandAndy return from Resident Evil Afterlife and compose another great industrial electronic film score that rocks and beats along with the action. Excellent and worth a purchase for the soundtrack again.

If you're a Resident Evil Fan of any of the films, this is highly recommended. One of most visceral, guns blazing action movies around, despite the basic plot. Paul WS Anderson keeps getting better at delivering stylized, action packed movies. He can still work on his storytelling however.

The 3D in Resident Evil Retribution delivers in spades, being filmed in three dimensions with on the set 3D camera rigs, we get a consistency of powerfully layered visuals, with clear stereo 3D distance between the objects onscreen. There are also plenty of pop outs to flinch away from as bullets and blades fly out of the screen to great effect. This is one of the best 3D movies you can get as Anderson shows he's not only a master of action movies, but stereo 3D scene composition. So if you're looking for another demo worthy 3D disc, look no further than Resident Evil Retribution, boosting the 3D up even more than Resident Evil Afterlife 3D. Exceptional 3D.

MOVIE: 8/10 Fine example of an all out action movie.
STORY: 6/10 Very basic Point A to B with some side stories added.
ACTION: 9/10. Really cool action, fights. Movie is 80% slick action.

(Same thing in one of the later Alien movies, can't remember which.) She is cute, though, gets everyone's prtoective instincts up, and doesn't get in the way of the shoot-em-up.

Jovovich does a great job, as always. She also manages to top that white strappy outfit she wore in Fifth Element - I'll let it be a surprise, but it certainly offers plenty to anyone fascinated by the female form, and Milla's in particular. The real suspense comes in anticipating a wardrobe malfunction that never occurs.

It's not highbrow stuff, but a good one of its sort. Popcorn-worthy, but forgettable.

5353414,4,B009MO5960,"Its not great and there are no wow moments, but this movie is a nonstop action sequence and I find it pretty entertainingeven if I probably won't want to see it again for another 10 years. LOL.

It seems that asking folks to list the Resident Evil movies in order of quality would be harder than getting an entire theater of fans to agree on pizza toppingsId say 1, 3, 5, 2, 4.  This fifth franchise installment, as with each of its predecessors, manages to deliver a new take on presenting the Resident Evil world and the next step in an elaborately plot-holey but perfectly followable plot.  The movie opens with a franchise recap (Millas typical narration) before picking up right where Afterlife (2010) left off.

Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil 1 & 4-6, Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) continues to helm the beloved Zompocalypse franchise and continues to spread his love of slow-motion during our opening action sequences.  The irreplaceable Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, Resident Evil 1-6, Ultraviolet) returns as Alice fighting her way out of an Umbrella corporation virus outbreak simulation facility.  She is joined by Ada Wong (Bingbing Li; Transformers: Age of Extinction), who is butt-kickin cute in her gun-geisha mistress outfit.  She also bumps into her Jovo-clones daughter (Aryana Engineer; Orphan) and her simulation clone neighbor (Michelle Rodriguez; Resident Evil, The Fate of the Furious).

Of course, at some point, Alice wakes up and spends abundant screen time scantily clad in a research facility before finding a ninja dominatrix outfit and all the weapons she could ever want.  Just conveniently waiting for her just like when Beckinsale awakens from her cryo-chamber in Underworld: Awakening to find her boots and leathers right there. Shortly after Alices hips and side-boob show, Wesker (Shawn Roberts; Resident Evil 4-6, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage) appears to drop an exposition bomb to explain the whole movie to us.

Under orders from the Red Queen, they are being hunted by Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory; Resident Evil 2 & 4) who is controlled by some weird mechanized heart-spider (that never gets explained) attached to her sternum which, like her cleavage, goes well-exposed throughout the movie.  At Valentines side are Rain (Michelle Rodriguez; Resident Evil, The Fate of the Furious) and Todd (Oded Fehr; Resident Evil 3-4), both bad guy clones of Alices former friends.  During this pursuit, a team including Kevin Durand (Legion, Real Steel) and Boris Kodjoe (Resident Evil: Afterlife, Surrogates) are working their way into the Umbrella facility to rescue Alice and Adaand they're working for Wesker!?!?!

The theme of the movie is Evil Goes Global.  But nothing felt particularly global about it (until the very last scene).  The tone and setting was notably less effective than previous franchise installments.  The global element seemed that the simulation facility has different cityscapeswhich Alice goes through like video game stages, one after the otherwhich emulate Moscow, Tokyo, Suburbia, and so on, so that potential world power buyers could see how a virus outbreak would affect their enemy nations metropolises.  All that these stages accomplished was making the franchise feel like a video game; a fault which, until the release of this installment, the franchise had successfully avoided.

Throughout these levels we find undead Russian soldiers, the giant hulking ogres from Afterlife and they still throw their axes in slow-motion, and we see a lot of a super-sized tongue lasher monster from first Resident Evil.  However, the execution of their action is rather lackluster.

Featuring solid zombie attack action and combat choreography, I liked the bright white hallway action sequence.  The gunshot blood-splatter gore was occasionally decent, but left much to be desired.  In fact, I could say that about most of the action.  The sprinting zombies with their quad-unhinging tentacle jaws (like Blade IIs vampires) were coolat first.  What happened?  Similarly shocking, the hand-to-hand combat was best in the franchise, but it lacked good finishers and standout moments.

Minus a few story-building scenes, this movie essentially boils down to a continuous 90-minute action sequence.  This probably sounds amazing, right?  It wasnt.  All the action felt a lot like background action in an otherwise great action movie.  You know?  Like when Optimus Prime was fighting Megatron, there were soldiers and other Autobots fighting Decepticons in the background (and it looked good), but nothing particularly cool would happen with the background fighters while the camera was focusing on the two heavy hitters.  In Retribution, this action is never punctuated by awesome moments; there are no highlights or climaxes.  Perhaps worst of all was the arctic martial arts finale between Alice, Rain, Valentine and others.  Hand-to-hand, Asian weapons, guns, and a lot of clever choreographyit was all entertaining. Very entertaining.  But I kept waiting for the Wow.  It never came.

The movie ends with a very Terminator-SkyNet apocalypse standoff at the White House between the remainder of humanity against a legion of Resident Evil beasts as if the videogames vomited all over the screen (perhaps in a good way).  So, as they tend to, they could easily pick up part 6 at the exact moment that closes Retribution, much as Retribution did with Afterlife (2010).

I have had a blast revisiting these films. Even the lesser installments are fun to watch (as long as its been a while).  Looking forward to part 6.",1350604800,,5591,5.238202247191011
5353415,5,B009MO5960,"With Resident Evil Retribution we are thrust into an otherworldly trip from the opening minutes of the movie. This is modern science fiction/horror that engulfs the viewer senses and does not let up throughout the whole movie.

I give this movie high rank with the production values and I agree with some of the other positive reviewers that the movie offers excellent directing, acting, cinematography, special effects and musical score. Hats off to Paul Anderson and team for turning out another excellent science fiction/ horror offering.

Certainly the Resident Evil movies have evolved from a more traditional horror movie to a more science fiction/horror based series, but this movie is a very entertaining example of modern cinema. I have seen the movie twice already (in 3D) and it leaves you wanting more. I especially like the ending and it sets a mysterious tone for the next movie.

5353416,5,B009MO5960,"There was plenty of action and plenty of new characters and things going on to hold your interest. The plot is simple and doesn't need to be more complicated - rescue Alice! The visuals, the sound, the music is all top notch! This is Resident Evil at its best!

The movie opens where RE#4 left off - on top of the Arcadia (freighter) with all the humans released and enjoying their freedom. I was hoping to have K-MART and especially Claire back. We aren't shown it, but are left to assume the worst for them. Based on how brutal the Umbrella attack is, it is a safe assumption that only someone like Alice could survive. The sequence is played in reverse, which was new and interesting.

The action doesn't slow for very long (just long enough for Alice to get kidnapped, get into a skin tight dominatrix/cat suit, and escape). Alice is smoking hot here!

I was beginning to think Alice was caught in a RE video game of sorts when the Tokyo sequence fired up around her (same one from the opening of RE#4, same people, same outcome). This was neat as reality and video game somewhat merges.

A part of the mutation this time around seems to be the mutants are harder to kill and one blow to the head does not necessarily take them out. Alice does wonders with a chain and one handgun to stave off an army of these tougher mutants.

Did you like the 12 foot axeman in RE #4? Try 2! Alice and Ada Wong team up to take them down! This is the New York sequence. Gotta love the subtle humor throughout! We hear the scraping of a big axe being dragged. Ada asks, ""Do you know what that is?"" Alice responds, ""I have an idea!""  Indeed she does!

Part of the zombie mutation this time around also seems to be INTELLIGENCE! There was a large bunch of Russian zombies operating vehicles and weapons with no problem (Moscow sequence)!

There was a bit of a love story in this. Alice falls in love with a little girl who mistakes her for her mommy (Suburbia sequence)! Alice's strong bond with the little girl is evident when she chases down and rescues the girl from a giant licker (despite everything about to get blown to kingdom come).

The zombies under ice was about as creepy as you can get. Alice sees them swimming under ice while battling evil Rain (RE#1). Rain falls under ice when Alice blows a hole in it; the zombies swarm up like piranha! One last attempt to break free as she says, ""I'm coming for you!"" Alice says, ""Good luck with that!"" as the zombies pull Rain under for good!

Something else different - one of the good guys turned bad.. turns good again! Remember Jill Valentine (RE#2 and very end of RE#4)?

The movie ends with a massive battle scene in progress (humankind versus zombies/dragons/red queen/etc.), and we know where it has to go now - but leaves room for RE#6. Alice and Albert Wesker versus the Red Queen (RE#1)? Perhaps in RE#6 they can get the help of the White Queen (RE#3)!

There is no extra ending this time like RE#4 where the movie picks back up after about a minute of ending credits. There is no final blurb from Alice at the very, very end, such as ""Is that any way to treat a lady (RE#4)?!"" or ""You're just another a****** (RE#3)!"" I watched all the credits just to make double sure! No matter, I think there was plenty overall and well worth the time and money spent.

I had seen the movie twice, and liked it even more the second time! There is so much action going on continuously that it's hard to get it all the first time! For sure I'll see more the 3rd time. Constant surprises!

This is definitely a dvd to add to the RE collection!",1350086400,92,3579,4.370481927710843
5353417,5,B009MO5960,"While no one can accuse the Resident Evil series of being too brainy, the films are all prime examples of one important factor frequently missing from today's films: FUN.

Much like the Transformers films, these aren't meant to change the world or make you think deep thoughts. It's just meant to inspire a good time. The critics of the series typically fall into two categories: people overly attached to the games who don't realize that film adaptations aren't meant to be the same as what they adapt (otherwise you'd have two of the same thing for no reason), and people who seem to think they know everything including what art is and assume everything should be molded to their standards.

(And the films are better than the games, anyway, in my opinion.)

RETRIBUTION is no exception the any of this. In fact, I believe it's the best film in the series. The directing, acting, story, special effects, music, and cinematography are all top notch for the budget. Especially for the budget. If you're watching this movie to have a good time you won't guess the film-makers spent less than $150 million for this movie. I looks and sounds great.

I can't speak for the DVD/Blu-ray because they aren't out yet, but the previous home releases all have a good selection of bonus features that make the purchase worth it!

5353419,4,B009MO5960,"There have been five of the ""Resident Evil"" movies now, all either written or directed by W.S. Anderson, who I'm not a huge fan of. When he brings his mind-numbing nonsense down to relatable level and doesn't get as ridiculous as he did with 2011's ""The Three Musketeers"", he has skill and he sure can bring the carnage like the best of them. So combining the ultra-popular genre of zombies with science fiction action appears to be a good recipe because this series, based on a very popular videogame, has been successful and has a reliable following.

I have to admit, as much as I'm not a huge fan of Anderson's, I have enjoyed this series. There are requirements for viewing a ""Resident Evil"" movie. First of all, you have to know at least some of the background from the videogame and the characters. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is the most popular character and the one you need to know the most about. Course there is also Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) who had her own starring role in the video game series. In this film, she works for the Umbrella Corporation, a company bent on world takeover with a T-virus and cloning.

There is so much back-story and history to this series that I couldn't possibly go into it and still write a review without losing you halfway through, so I won't. The movie even starts with a fairly long back-story, but even it doesn't help. You either know, or you don't.

The problem with the ""Resident Evil"" series is the lack of feeling you get from endless gunfire and explosions. In a series that has humanity in peril around every corner, the lack of humanity in its storytelling has been its achilles heel. The action has always been cool and intense, but at some point or another, the relentlessness of it sort of desensitizes you. Eventually, the cool effects lose their impact. That being said, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" did something about that. Nothing sucks an audience into a perilous situation like an eight-year old girl with a hearing impairment. As the movie unfolds Alice finds herself attached to her daughter, a clone, and you as an audience member are just as concerned for that girl's safety.

The story is convoluted, but some of the best action sequences in the entire series are present here. They aren't overwhelmingly ridiculous. Insert some humanity and feeling in the form of an eight-year old deaf girl who is probably the only actor in the film who brings the movie down to reality, and ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is one of the best of the series. I don't know how much that is saying. You're either a fan, or you're not. ""Retribution"" is a decent time at the movies.",1349913600,4,2636,4.686825053995681
5353420,2,B009MO5960,"With visually appealing action set-pieces and paper-thin characters, ""Resident Evil: Retribution,"" the fifth entry of the series based on the hit Capcom video game, gives us what exactly we expect from its origin: lots of combat scenes and a rambling narrative.

""Resident Evil: Retribution"" picks up right where ""Afterlife"" ended, with the previous film's last scene replayed (but not in the usual way), followed by a recap of the series so far. Then the story of ""Retribution"" begins, about Milla Jovovich's heroine Alice, trapped inside the underwater facilities of The Umbrella Corporation. Many characters from the previous ""Resident Evil"" movies appear, including Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), either as her aide or enemy.

Milla Jovovich cuts a great action heroine figure as before, and writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson provides some stylish fight choreography, but the fact that the ""dead"" characters have come back in the series undermines the tension considerably that was in the first (and, to a lesser degree, third) installment. Even if Alice (or whoever you like) gets killed, she will be back. This is like hitting a reset button of a game.

Or is it that the director is making fun of game conventions? Or is it that Paul W.S. Anderson has run out of ideas to keep the story going? I don't know. He gives each character enough moment to fight, but not the reason why he or she should be fighting.

Mainly just to keep his Eurotrash wife employed. I can't believe that FIVE of these movies have been made over the last ten years and there's not a single one that I can say was any good!?!

They're cynically stupid and even worse is that considering they're based on a series of Horror games there's no actual, you know, HORROR in them beyond whatever make-up effects and gore is splattered on the screen. No mood, atmosphere, suspense, nothing, just Anderson indulging in his delusion that people want to see a 100 pound model running around, shooting stuff and spinning in the air while he pilfers from the Matrix films and even wholesale rips off the opening of the terrible 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake.

Anderson (""Resident Evil 1, 4 & 5"", ""Death Race"", ""Aliens Vs. Predator"", ""The Three Musketeers""). At one point, Paul W.S. added the 'W.S.' because he was ""tired of having to explain the significance of the frogs falling from the sky"" in ""Magnolia"". Whoever made that mistake wasn't very observant.

It is easy to identify a film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson; strange involving stories filled with amazing performances in beautifully crafted films.

It is just as easy to identify a film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson; stories adapted from video games or made to look like video games, filled with wooden performances from extremely pretty former models (male and female) in films filled with explosions, gore and computer-generated effects. And the films usually contain the latest, most wooden performance from Milla Jovovich, the director's wife.

Paul W.S. Anderson should be happy for the mistaken identity. If I were the perpetrator of as much garbage as W.S., I would be happy to be mistaken for a true artist.

""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is a terrible, terrible film. None of the sequels in this series have a beginning or end and there is never any suspense. There can't be any suspense because you know Alice, Jovovich's character, will never die. In fact, she can't die. So no matter how many armed men, how many mutant CGI dogs, how many flesh cutting lasers the director throws at her, you know she will never die. The only thing that will kill Alice is if people stop going to these films, if they stop renting them, if they stop downloading them. Only then, will ""Resident Evil"" end.

Because the films are based on a video game, Anderson seems content to keep the narrative as simple as possible. And the films ultimately play into this formula. In each, Alice has to get from point A to point B, while maneuvering a number of obstacles. In other words, she has to get from Level A to Level B, exactly the same goal of playing most video games. This narrative formula can never change and it will never allow for a beginning or end. Because everything in these films is ""middle"", the narrative has an enhanced unpleasant, unsettling effect. It doesn't help the viewer become grounded in all of the violence, mayhem and carnage.

Despite the change in settings, the only other thing that changes is the people around Annie. These characters can die, and most of them do, but even some of the fallen come back to life in slightly altered form. How is this possible? The Umbrella Organization, the unimaginatively named evil group controlling everything in Alice's universe, wants to mess with Alice's mind. Ali Larter (TV's ""Heroes""), Wentworth Miller (TV's ""Prison Break""), Oded Fehr (""The Mummy"", TV's ""Covert Affairs""), Boris Kodjoe and many others have served alongside Annie at one point or another before getting killed.

""Retribution"" picks up before installment #4 ends. The last scene of that film is replayed twice in #5, both forward and backward. I'm not exactly sure why this was done, but Anderson clearly thinks he has some cool special effects to show off, so we watch the scene play in reverse, in slow motion, and then watch the scene again as it plays forward. A few minutes later, Alice revisits the Tokyo intersection she spent some time at in number 4. Again, not sure why we have to spend time in this place again, but both of these instances point to a filmmaker who is running short on ideas.

When the film actually begins moving forward, Alice is suddenly shielding her 'daughter', protecting her from suburban zombies. Eventually, Alice meets up with a group of men who will try to help her get to an abandoned Russian submarine base. They feel they can take one of the subs and find safety. Boris Kodjoe, Johann Urb, Bingbing Li, Oded Fehr and Michelle Rodriquez all join the fun as various targets for the armed militia employed by the Umbrella Organization.

If you press me, the only positive I can comment on is that each film seems to assemble a multi-ethnic cast of pretty people as supporting characters. Unfortunately, most of these are killed off one-by-one.

Why a Russian submarine? Not sure.

In #4, Alice was invincible because she was injected with a serum that bonded with her genes and made her impervious. At the end of the film, these powers were taken away. This is an important illustration of what I was referring to earlier. There can be no suspense in these films, because Alice is never hurt. If the powers that make her invincible can't change this, what will? Also, it seems like a bit of a cheat for the filmmakers to do one thing and then change it back again. The filmmakers are creating this world, they are setting the rules.  When they change the rules they have created, they cheat the viewer and telegraph their own lack of creativity. Who knows they may even change this back again for #6.

I guess we really shouldn't expect even good acting in a film like this, the fourth sequel of a movie based on a video game, or in a film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (even Joan Allen and Ian MacShane couldn't transcend ""Death Race""), but it is mind-numbingly bad. Jovovich looks like she is saying her lines phonetically and doesn't do anything but shout or grimace. The rest of the cast is negligible. The males, presumably tough guys, grimace a lot and glare. Michelle Rodriguez, the toughest of the group, manages to grimace in a slightly different way, at times, giving her more of a range. Wouldn't it be a surprise is one of these films actually contained a single performance that could qualify as acting?

""Retribution"" ends with a scene setting up the next inevitable installment. Really, folks. The only way this series will ever end is if we don't buy another ticket, pay for another download, rent another DVD. These movies are not good and really have no redeeming value, so this should be a fairly easy goal.

5353426,5,B009MO5960,"Honestly I am a major fan or horror movies and zombie movies and such movies like that. I fell in love with the Resident Evil movies and this one just had me excited throughout the whole movie. I was so excited to see what Alice (Milla Jovovich) would do next. She, as always, is bad ass in this movie. I can't wait for the 6th one and I definitely cannot wait for this one to be released on DVD because I will absolutely buy it. I love Resident Evil to death. Best movie series ever! I think the length of the movie was good, but I do honestly have to say that I wish it were longer. But for the money I paid to see it in 3D at the theaters, it was well worth it. This is coming from a major Resident Evil fanatic. Haha. I recommend this movie to anyone.",1348358400,,755,3.973684210526316
5353427,4,B009MO5960,"This movie is fifth in the franchise, which was based on a video game to start with. I think it's a sign that the series is aging when a cute little girl gets thrown in. (Same thing in one of the later Alien movies, can't remember which.) She is cute, though, gets everyone's prtoective instincts up, and doesn't get in the way of the shoot-em-up.

Jovovich does a great job, as always. She also manages to top that white strappy outfit she wore in Fifth Element - I'll let it be a surprise, but it certainly offers plenty to anyone fascinated by the female form, and Milla's in particular. The real suspense comes in anticipating a wardrobe malfunction that never occurs.

It's not highbrow stuff, but a good one of its sort. Popcorn-worthy, but forgettable.

5353428,4,B009MO5960,"In my summary I mentioned RE 5 is great for fans of the movie series and games. If your true genuine lover of zombies this movie is for you! Non- fans may enjoy it because of the GREAT ACTION!I have followed the movies since the first back in 2002 and fell in love right away. Movie picks up right after the ""Afterlife."" Alice sums up all the movies in the beginning; however,a lot is left out from what she shares in the beginning. This movie brings a lot in from the games and with that it gives you a game kind of feel during the movie. Alice and her team have to complete stages and kill bosses. Non-stop fun and action from start to finish. You have almost time to think during the movie; I sat through the credits processing ""What just happened"" in the last 1hr & 1/2? I encourage you to give RE 5 a chance and help yourself by not listening to all the RE Film criticizers and the critics. It makes me wonder if they even watched the movies? I was hoping it was a bit longer of a movie, Alice giving us another summary of the films (a waste of valuable time), and the whole thing with A. Wesker? Overall 4/5 stars. These movies are promising and I would say their is a bright future ahead for the RE Film Series!!!",1348012800,,1220,4.173728813559322
5353429,5,B009MO5960,"ALICE SHOT AND KNIFED ME BETWEEN THE EYES AND I LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT!!!!! (Not to mention the large axe and giant licker removing my head, etc!) These effects were even better than RE#4. The best effect was when Alice slung the blade at me! I just about **** myself with that one! VERY REAL! It was right there!

Just a note, you do need 3D glasses to see it in 3D. The standard glasses do not fit over prescription glasses. A clip on (to prescription glasses) version of the 3D glasses exists. There is the non 3D version of the movie as well.

The movie opens where RE#4 left off - on top of the Arcadia (freighter) with all the humans released and enjoying their freedom. I was hoping to have K-MART and especially Claire back. We aren't shown it, but are left to assume the worst for them when Umbrella attacks. This in itself added an element of sadness to start it all. The opening scene in reverse was different, sort of a ""wish we could go back and try again"" in their remembrance. The movie does not pretend they never existed, we do see a few stills of K-MART, Claire & Chris Redfield from RE#4.

The action doesn't slow for very long (just long enough for Alice to get kidnapped, get into a skin tight dominatrix/cat suit, and escape).

I was beginning to think Alice was caught in a RE video game of sorts when the Tokyo sequence fired up around her (same one from the opening of RE#4, same people, same outcome).

Did you like the 12 foot axeman in RE #4? Try 2! Alice and Ada Wong team up to take them down!
This is the New York sequence. Be prepared to get a haircut, a shave, and a beheading!

Part of the zombie mutation this time around seems to be INTELLIGENCE! There was a large bunch of Russian zombies operating vehicles and weapons with no problem (Moscow sequence)!

There was a bit of a love story in this. Alice falls in love with a little girl who mistakes her for her mommy (Suburbia sequence)! Alice's strong bond with the little girl is evident when she chases down and rescues the girl from a giant licker (despite everything about to get blown to kingdom come).

The zombies under ice was about as creepy as you can get. Alice sees them swimming under ice while battling evil Rain (RE#1). Rain falls under ice when Alice blows a hole in it; the zombies swarm up like piranha! One last attempt to break free as she says, ""I'm coming for you!"" Alice says, ""Good luck with that!"" as the zombies pull Rain under for good!

Something else different - one of the good guys turned bad.. turns good again! Remember Jill Valentine (RE#2 and very end of RE#4)?

The movie ends with a massive battle scene in progress (humankind versus zombies/dragons/red queen/etc.), and we know where it has to go now - but leaves room for RE#6. Alice and Albert Wesker versus the Red Queen? I wouldn't have seen that coming!

There is no surprise ending this time like RE#4 where the movie picks back up after about a minute of ending credits. There is no final blurb from Alice at the very, very end, such as ""Is that any way to treat a lady (RE#4)?!"" or ""You're just another a****** (RE#3)!""

This movie opened at #1 this past weekend, and if it does well overall, rumor has it there will be RE#6! As a huge RE fan, this would be fine with me! Fingers crossed!

I have seen the movie twice in 3D, and liked it even more the second time! There is so much action going on continuously that it's hard to get it all the first time! Probably I'd see more the 3rd time. Constant surprises! (Nice, NRA protesting) Rain and Suburbia Alice have a conversation while speeding away from the zombies only to be suddenly interupted by a...well... go see it. You won't be sorry.

Final note: I am writing this at the time the movie is still in the theater and not yet out on dvd. So when the dvd does get released, I do not expect Amazon to separate the 3D from the non-3D reviews like last time (RE#4).",1348012800,8,3901,4.34065934065934

Not only does it have the absolute BEST fighting/action/shooting scenes & stunts of the series to date, but it also re-introduces(and freshly introduces) a ton of key characters from the games & also fills in the hole of the mystery behind what befell each of them. I won't spoil it here for anyone, but nothing in the series up to this point has even remotely came close to delivering such an original & amazing scene of events. Its an absolute marvel to watch and its very clear that director Paul W.S Anderson & lead actress Milla Jovovich (Alice) are both huge fans of the games. Something that was lacking in alot of the previous titles, this one is clearly made for the fans by a true fan. Its the best RE yet and I cant express enough how great of a job director Paul & his team did on this movie. Excellent movie and the best RE yet so far!!",1522281600,,948,4.2430939226519335
