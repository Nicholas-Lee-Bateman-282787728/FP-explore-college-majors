3512284,3,B001CGBS0M,"I am a Jennifer Kreis fan--her style of Pilates instruction (methodical, even-toned, not over the top motivational) appealed to me in her tapes (Target Specifics). That is why when I decided to go for a Pilates DVD, I was searching for her. Yet, this DVD is very different--she does not model the exercises. Instead, she walks around another model, talking through the poses and excercises. It may sound petty, but I found the result somewhat distracting as I was trying to follow both Jennifer and the model. When you are on the 90 repetition of the 100 breaths, that is no fun.

I definitely recommend Pilates for DVD excersice, but would have prefered a DVD with people who appear in it that are in synch, rather than with an instructor walking around.",1242086400,14,755,4.71969696969697

8287600,5,B001CGBS0M,"Having used the New Body Pilates I for some time, I found this a lot faster and challenging.
I love it.",1363478400,3,103,3.9523809523809526
8287601,5,B001CGBS0M,"This series/ instructor is wonderful.  She is calm, statuesque, and patient - at the end of her workouts, you feel like you've worked oput with your best friend rather than having been pummelled by some hyperperky blond thing that makes you feel inferior no matter what you do.  This series is perfect for all ability types because she is so good at explaining everything she does, and you can go at your own speed.  I lost 12 lbs. the first 2 weeks and was amazed to find that one could sweat like a dog on the space of a mat...",1361059200,4,529,4.27
8287602,4,B001CGBS0M,"Good product, better than the introductory CD, and worth the money! Looking forward to getting the level III edition! I wish the session was a little longer and there were more strength exercises instead of so much reliance on stretching, but stretching is never a bad thing.",1322438400,2,275,4.872340425531915
8287603,5,B001CGBS0M,"this one was for my girlfriend and she loved it, she still uses it almost every day, plus it is a great low impact exercise for her!",1318464000,,132,3.925925925925926
8287604,4,B001CGBS0M,I purchased this exercise DVD for my wife and daughter and they seem to love it. They get in the floor with their mats ( they also go to a Pilate class ) and exercise along with the DVD.  the DVD came within a very reasonable time frame and I give it whatever the best review you can give. They got it before they even needed it.  Thanks,1312934400,,337,3.9411764705882355
8287605,5,B001CGBS0M,"This is a continuation (part 2) of New Body! Pilates . This is for the intermediate level. The menu choices are: the mat workout (36 mins.) and the sculpting series (9 mins). Equipment used were a mat and very lightweight dumbbells. Jennifer continues with the mat workout for the intermediate level in which the pace is a bit quicker, but she explains and directs each movement to give the viewer a better understanding of the Pilates method. The second workout uses (or without) very lightweight dumbbells (1-2 lbs) and exercises are done standing. Very simple, short reps of arm exercises.",1263340800,9,592,4.93
8287606,3,B001CGBS0M,"This is my second Jennifer Kries Pilates video. She's an obvious expert in her field. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is difficult to get it to play on my computer, sometimes taking 5-10 minutes of trying to make the menu choice actually play the video. I don't seem to have that problem with other videos. Not sure what the problem is.",1250812800,,356,4.25
8287607,4,B001CGBS0M,I've had this DVD for about 3 months. When I purchased it I had done Pilates through VHS tapes I owned and a class that I took. I've used this DVD off and on. I enjoy Ms. Kries as an instructor and the instruction portion of the DVD is great. I found that after a few rounds of doing the DVD (as with any produced exercise video) I got bored hearing the instruction and wanted to power through the workout in less time. I simply fast forward through those parts or do the next exercise I know is coming up and then fast forward. One suggestion for the next DVD series: Have one session with full instruction. Then include a separate session with the same exercises in a flow--without the interruptions.,1245801600,8,702,4.366412213740458
8287608,4,B001CGBS0M,"I have done Jennifer Kries's Method series many times and as someone that practices Pilates at home as part of my exercise program I was anxious to seek our her intermediate pilates work-out.  As usual, Jennifer's instruction was top notch.  She explains the moves clearly, and indicates when modifications may be necessary.  My one wish though was that she was actually performing the exercises.  She has an exerciser that she works with in the dvd and Jennifer sits on a chair behind her explaining the exercises.  I didn't really care for that format, hence a knock-off of one of the stars since I don't know if this instructional style would be one that I would want to do over and over.  Several good points though are that the model is using good form and Jennifer also has her do the exercise incorrectly as well, in some instances so that she can show the difference from proper and improper form.

The exercises themselves are ones that those familiar with Pilates would know....the 100, rolling like a ball, the seal, the saw and the dreaded teaser among others....The Pilates segment is half an hour long and gives you plenty of core work out throughout.  There is also a 10 minute section on toning with weights that was a nice addition to the dvd.  Once again, the exercises are well executed and variations are shown for those who want to step it up a notch in the toning section.

Overall, a good workout, but due to the fact that the instructor sat behind on a chair the whole time, that didn't make it my most favorite of her programs.  If this style of instruction won't bother you, I would recommend for the good instruction and the excellent form that is shown on each exercise.",1243382400,29,1698,4.607973421926911
