4856588,5,B005PBJJ5G,"I love this dvd! You learn so much more than just dance steps. Pallavi explains what the moves and gestures mean as well as a beautiful choreography. The song, Aaja Nachle, is such a lively and fun song it really gets you excited to dance. I also love the fitness workout! You definetly break a sweat! I can't wait for another dvd to come out by Learn to Bollywood with Pallavi!",1320192000,,378,4.338028169014085
4856589,5,B005PBJJ5G,"This DVD has a couple of great cardio workouts. If you want to build the Aaja Nachle track into your work out routine here is the perfect way. The cardio workouts are fun, full of energy and have some bollywood moves that one can actually use on a dance floor!!",1319673600,3,261,4.24
4856590,5,B005PBJJ5G,"We have Pallavi's first instructional video and loved it!  She has done it again and created a fast, fun and colorful new instructional video with Learn to Bollywood Dance and Fitness:  Aaja Nachle!

The fast pace and easy instructions get you moving in no time!

I highly recommend this product!",1318982400,,296,4.86
4856591,5,B005PBJJ5G,"Have you ever watched a Bollywood dance and wondered what the hand gestures, eye and head movements mean? If the answer is yes, then this dvd is for you. It is an instructional dance dvd which has bonus dance workout that gives you the tools to watch bollywood dance with new eyes. It's not  nonstop movement . What you will get is very detailed instructions with slow explanations. Also, this isn't pure bollywood, but is a mixture of classical Indian dance , Bollywood and Bhangra dance. Pallavi teaches the Sanskrit and English names for the hand and face gestures. This is very instructional and informative for people who are interested in Classical Indian dance. Pallavi combines the mudras with foot patterns and explanations. It was very interesting to see that the movements tell a story or express an emotion. What I particularly liked about the dvd was that Pallavi explains movements to help you understand the meaning of the movements. It's great to see a beginner's instructional dvd that gives the viewer the tools and encouragement to explore the dance form on their own. Not to mention loved the exercise routine which is wonderful to workout your abs! Great work Pallavi...keep it up..hope to see many more such DVD's from you!",1318809600,7,1245,4.900473933649289
4856592,5,B005PBJJ5G,"Are there ANY instructional bollywood dance dvds that follow the song's story, just like in bollywood movies?  True fans of bollywood movies know there is something going on behind the music and those fun and sassy moves.  With this dvd, YES!!  Pallavi's choreography tells a fun and lively story about being at the bazaar, surrounded by admirers, the streets littered with all the gold and jewels we deserve... Over the top fun!

There is a lot of bollywood emoting, loads of technical help and GREAT stories that show the cultural foundations of this dance style.  And the TWO bonus follow-along dance chapters are like mini-choreographies themselves. For a dancer, this offers a mountain of wealth in the form of authentic movements, gestures and combos.  For someone who just wants to workout with bollywood flair, the bonus chapters are great!

Finding an affordable way to study bollywood has been a struggle in the Midwest.  A local class cost $350 PLUS registration fees!  Pallavi's dvds are a great way to learn, grow as a dancer and know that when I perform at bellydance events, I'm bringing something authentic to add to the diversity of dance they now show.  Aaja Nachle is a blast to dance!",1317686400,,1204,4.886699507389163
4856593,4,B005PBJJ5G,I've always loved Bollywood dancing and the Indian culture so I bought this for my daughter and I to learn. The steps are easy to follow and I love how it all ties in to a story (you learn the history behind the moves!).,1352851200,2,220,4.0227272727272725
4856594,2,B005PBJJ5G,"ok, i bought this dvd after a lot of research. to be very frank, a normal dance/fitness dvd costs around 6-10$. this one is much more costlier. so, no doubt i expected it to teach me some great steps of bollywood dance.
and what do i get? a dance clas for the song ""aja nachle"" from the movie of same name. to begin with, i really don't like the song. the song is not like the other bollywood songs, which just force you out of your chair to dance.
the teacher is good, and she has simplified the steps. but lets be honest, the dance taught is hardly bollywood dance. it is semi classical indian dance. and another harsh fact, the steps taught won't be useful on a dance floor, coz, frankly, bollywood dance today hardly has any semi-classical numbers.
overall, the cd disappoints!",1346889600,5,781,4.430555555555555
4856595,5,B005PBJJ5G,Loved d movie... Bought it to learn it for our mother daughter dance with my daughter. Everybody expected spanish latin music... We defently stole d show!!! Great workout even learning it.... Wish there could be more of famous bollywood dances videos like this one!!!!,1339200000,,268,5.113636363636363
4856596,5,B005PBJJ5G,"What a package...My Daughter had so much fun learning form this DVD with me...Easy to understand, and step by step to do it with Pallavi..she did really amazing job to brake it down in story telling of this dance. you can learn on your pace. I love the lotus pose and market walk....if you follow this DVD..you will be ready to perform for any last minute song at the wedding for sure...my daughter is taking this DVD with her sleep over night party to dance with her all American Friend. Guys, It's great birthday gift for girls...love it and I recommend to all..she also has bonus Bollywood Fitness work out in it...so its good to get in to fit for all ages with dancing mode",1327795200,,677,4.424
4856597,5,B005PBJJ5G,"""Bollywood and me? No way!"" Did you think it's not your cup of tea. You will be amazed at yourself, how gracefully you can dance with ""Aaja Nachle""

Do it yourself or with your friends! You will have lots of fun. The contents are well-organized in chapters. Each chapter teaches you something very doable. E.g. Chapter called `Rooftop poses' focuses on presenting yourself gracefully and going into many beautiful poses ready to be photographed. Once you complete 8 chapters at your own pace, you are ready for a stage performance.

This DVD provides a fun way of work-out too in the bonus chapters. I really like this way of exercising. It is a fantastic way to keep yourself fit.

The 2 cardio-workouts have been designed to get all your muscles in action including facial muscles. You will be smiling all the way while you tap your feet and sway your arms on the catchy beats!
This is a great way to start something new, today!",1326844800,5,930,4.624242424242424
4856598,5,B005PBJJ5G,"This new DVD from Pallavi is amazing! I love the way she breaks down the song in chapters making it easy to learn. My daughter specially likes how all the verses are explained. It helps even a non-Hindi speaker understand the song therefore enhancing the joy of learning. Dancing along in the workout section is so much fun that it makes one forget that we are actually working out. There is a lot packed in one DVD, teaching dance, a complete performance, and a workout section.

This DVD comes across as a kaleidoscope of colors and has a very festive feel to it. Great way for mothers and daughters to spend time together. I know I had fun learning this dance with my daughter! A very economical way to learn dance at your own pace, alone or with friends.",1326758400,,758,4.453237410071942
4856599,5,B005PBJJ5G,"I really liked this DVD. Especially since it explains every hand movement and gesture. It is very well explained by the instructor, makes it look very simple. The step-by-step choreography and the detailed explanation of the lyrics was very helpful. Very well made DVD. The bonus cardio-workout is a fun, high-energy workout routine, especially if you like to add a 'dance-twist' to your exercise routine. I would recommend this product.",1326240000,,437,5.257142857142857
4856600,5,B005PBJJ5G,"This DVD is all-in-one fun pack. I found it a great source to learn bollywood dancing. The instructions are simple to follow. It also has a complete choreography for one popular bollywood song. The instructor, Pallavi, is very energetic and has lot of grace. I love the bonus fitness routine. Fun to try with family and friends!",1323043200,,328,4.771929824561403
4856601,5,B005PBJJ5G,"I used to be in Pallavi's Bollywood class and loved learning her dances. I had to move away after a year and I was really sad to be leaving her class. I've had a hard time trying to find a Bollywood class where I live so I was really excited when this DVD came out. Her first DVD is just as great as the second one!

Aaja Nachle is my favorite Bollywood song and this routine is so much fun!! I really love how Pallavi breaks down the routine into several different combinations. It allows you to repeat it as many times as you want and practice that specific part with music.

I also liked how Pallavi explains the song and movements as you learn the routine. Even though I love the song, I didn't really know what the words actually meant and now I do.

I hope Pallavi makes more Learn to Bollywood DVD's because they are so much fun and I love learning her routines!",1320710400,,869,4.191616766467066
4856602,5,B005PBJJ5G,"This dvd series is fantastic. Volume 1:Dhoom Taana, was so fun that after learning the dance for a couple of days, I signed up for email notifications for future dvds (and I may or may not have sent one or two pestering emails begging for another dance)...and here it is! Volume 2's dance is a little more intricate and pretty, so its a great accent to Dhoom Taana. Its got all the perks of Volume 1 (instruction using a mirror so you don't have to worry about using opposite arms and legs as instructor, step-by-step guides to moves, easy-to-navigate menus, great music, and extra cardio workouts if you want to step it up), but the dance is so different from the first that it doesnt feel repetitive. Its fun by yourself, but try learning it with your friends! My sister and I learned Dhoom Taana last year, then put on a big show, bangles and all, at the holiday get-together. Maybe we have a new Christmas tradition...with a Bollywood twist!",1320624000,11,945,4.564705882352941
8482453,4,B005PBJJ5G,"love her enthusiasm, knowledge, explanations.  Done at a pace that is great for beginners, my only feedback would be that instead of a run through with music at the end of that section focusing on that section only - you should run through with the music what they have learnt up to there.  ie. just learnt section 2 combination now lets run through with the music putting section 1 and 2 together then adding each time you learn a new part.

Otherwise her steps are lovely and thank you for explaining the meaning of the words and steps.  Those who are not Indian learning Bollywood need to understand the importance of the steps matching the meaning of the words of the song rather than just the beat.

great dvd looking forward to more!",1409702400,,739,4.526315789473684
8482454,5,B005PBJJ5G,"I wanted less impact than Zumba, but with whole body involvement.  Pallavi is lovely and explains the moves in  patient detail.

8482459,1,B005PBJJ5G,Hard to follow and frustrating.  Short and chopped up sequences.  Waste of money and time!  I am throwing this one out!,1379030400,,119,4.571428571428571
8482460,5,B005PBJJ5G,"Transport yourself to an Indian bazaar filled with your many admirers and let your inner Bollywood diva come out to play!  Aaja Nachle, from the movie of the same name, is such a fun and sassy song that you can't help but to get out of your seat and dance!

Pallavi's teaching style is clear, specific, and well-paced.  The entire dance is broken down into eight short and easily digestible combinations that are reviewed often, both with and without music.  The flow of the DVD menus makes it easy to move at your own pace and review specific combinations until you're ready to move on.  Pallavi also provides lots of great background information about the dance moves and the lyrics of the song, painting a vivid picture and wonderfully setting the tone for this flirty and energetic choreography.  Pallavi is so friendly and personal in her instruction, you really feel like you're in her dance studio with her.  Great DVD for beginners and more experienced dancers alike!

Inclusion of a follow-along cardio fitness routine was a really nice bonus and lets you sample some music and moves outside of Aaja Nachle.  Can't wait for the next DVD!",1377388800,,1146,4.776649746192893
8482461,2,B005PBJJ5G,The purpose of purchasing this was for working out more than learning actual dances. I should have read the promp more carefully,1376784000,,128,4.863636363636363
8482462,5,B005PBJJ5G,"Wow, studio setting! I loved learning from this DVD because i felt like i was in a studio with the instructor Pallavi. Felt like she was teaching only me, i was able to follow her moves and also advance on to the performance section. Definitely a good buy",1369699200,,255,4.333333333333333
