7932350,5,B000056MOS,"This DVD captures concert performances from the mid-80s of La Mer, Afternoon of a Faun, and the 2nd Suite from Daphne and Chloe.  These are wonderfully sensual pieces that von Karajan had recorded several times before and the DVD really captures some great performances. Karajan really draws out the beauty of these pieces and the sound is excellent and is of CD quality. The photography is quite good and does not, like some DVDs in this collection really focus on the conductor -- rather it shifts to the individual instruments that of the greatest interest at a given momemnt in a piece (e.g., the flute in Faun). If you like these pieces, this is definitely a DVD to own.
