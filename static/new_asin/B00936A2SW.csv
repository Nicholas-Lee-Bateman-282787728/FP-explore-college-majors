5253879,3,B00936A2SW,"Here we have a movie where the film is the center of the story told...aviation...a few lines from the story I found interesting""boogeyman..4 years old"" ""shot to the moon""...Ill say something about these later on..Here we have pat o'brien in the lead and that is the main problem with the film but not really the idea of transpacific flight is what holds our interest...a picture of  the golden gate bridge I believe...and the aerial shots are quite good..O'brien is a good character actor and is ok but I find in a film where the film points to him as the center your mind will go elsewhere to more interesting actors and better talent..they do try to shore up the film and briefly show a love interest..a scene with a former wife..and Pat seems stiff..I don't know what the audience thought..a wife who leaves comes back and before departing he wants a kiss(not exactly great screenwriting)although they're separating..and his romantic overtures are nothing but embarrassing..as a matter of fact he asts in monotone throughout without changeing..the Bogart character here in a change of pace perks our interest..he seems to get into these roles and is lively and has some passion and reviewers and box office responded in his early films..which is why his contract was renewed..here he is the flyer the line about the boogeyman and four year olds..flying was a great fear back than the unknown space..and this movie was made in the wake of things to come(1935)'a shot to the moon'(a favorite of Reagan's see Reagan a life in letters..p661)...the way that this new phenomenon can awaken old fears is the best line in the film, there aren't many. The flight nscenes on the way to Guam and Manila are ok considering its an old film, and my copy of the Warner's film is a decent copy...it shows the people at Warner's are looking at international films and global issues and even though this film is much more minor keyed..there just going to China and the next role is London...the idea of what the U.S. wanted to become if the war had not intervened..and in view of alternate history like some scifi film..it would be a different country since differnet minds in the bureaucracy and military...would have had influence..its interesting how wars and reactions change a country for better or worse..so here we have  a1936 view of flying as a leap frog to the view of the U.S. in the future and the few asian islands..they seem to avoid China and the chinese as a place not accomodating as a nicely featured girl at film's end sais, going to China ""who wants to go to China"" or something to that effect?",1353196800,,2599,4.747787610619469
5253880,3,B00936A2SW,"This is a so-so movie with excellent views of period aircraft and airborne photography. The movie is a fictionalized version of Juan Trippe's founding of Pan American Airways and its expansion across the Pacific. Excellent photography of the original Martin M-130 China Clipper and of it flying over San Fransisco while the Oakland Bay Bridge was under construction. If you are a fan of period seaplanes and flying boats, add a star to the rating.

The Movie appears to be a very good copy of a very good original print. It does not appear to be cleaned up or remastered, but image quality is very good. I was disappointed that there were no special features or historical data other than the 1936 movie trailer.",1348099200,17,712,4.741935483870968

The story centers on a somewhat obsessed businessman (Pat O'Brien) who stops at nothing to succeed. I found the main character (Pat O'Brien) a little repulsive a couple of times in the movie when berating his wife and his employees. I thought Pat O'Brien came across as a little too obnoxious in his role, although he is considered to be one of the top actors of that day. Having an ambivalent reaction to this movie, loving the story of plane but disliking a somewhat tyrannical businessman, I give the movie only three stars.",1451692800,3,732,4.553030303030303

It does a nice job or portraying the challenges of the birth of civilian aviation.  That might seem dry, but it wasn't.  Those guys were the high-tech pioneers of their day, and took huge risks with no assurance of payoffs.  Also, flying was vastly more dangerous then, than now.",1444176000,,427,4.64
5253890,3,B00936A2SW,"The plot line of this movie was 1930's mediocre, even with Humphrey Bogart in it, but the scenes of the Martin-130 making its flight across the Pacific, taking off and flying and landing a few times, was spectacular, and that in itself makes the heart soar.  If one watches the film for this, it is very worthwhile.  Humphrey Bogart in any event was able to give us much better shortly, in Casablanda.",1442534400,2,401,4.555555555555555

5253893,4,B00936A2SW,"Not all the engines in this 1936 aviation film ran at full power.  The romantic dimensions of the plot weren't high octane.  Playing a driven airline executive, Pat OBrien rolled, but his performance didn't pitch or yaw.  Humphrey Bogarts great films were in the future.  The scenes featuring the Martin M-130 China Clipper flying boat are the highlight of the film  and there are cameos of the Sikorski S-42, the Fokker Trimotor, and other aircraft -- but this viewer wanted more.

What makes this film worth watching is its portrayal of the technical and organizational complexity of laying out the transoceanic air routes.  Flying from the U.S. to China required more than a great aircraft and great pilots.  There was the science and technology of radio communication, weather reporting, and establishing refueling stops for the flying boats.  There was push-the-envelope design, government certification for aircraft safety, professional schooling for pilots and navigators, and venture capital.  The film shows how all these had to come together, and bringing them together required aggressive management.

Pat OBriens character in the film is a thinly veiled portrayal of the legendary airline executive Juan Trippe, founder of Pan American Airways.  Trippe was played by Alec Baldwin in The Aviator, the 2004 film that followed the career of Howard Hughes.  The two different portrayals of Trippe may lead the viewer to learn more about civil aviation between the wars.

5253905,3,B00936A2SW,"Production values from 1937 are not up to today's expectations, but it is a good chance to see actual film of one of the types of China Clipper aircraft, rather than a computer-generated image.",1408752000,,193,4.705882352941177
5253906,4,B00936A2SW,"This is a fun movie typical of the drama of the mid-1930's.  China Clipper is a fictional tale of a start up airline that by all appearances is Pan-Am Airlines. ""Dave,"" played by Pat O'Brien is the leader of all small group of friends from WW1 who struggle and sacrifice to start a small airline with only one plane.

As their tiny little airline grows through the struggles of  financing, logistics of foreign flights, hurricanes and good old government red tape, Dave turns into a rabid task master.  Sacrificing his marriage and all else as relentlessly works to grow this once small airline into a giant international conglomerate, speeding passengers through the skies of South and Central America with the goal of crossing the mighty Pacific Ocean.

As a classic movie lover, this movie is fun to watch on a rainy day when you are stuck inside, or just want to sit back and shed the stress of the day.

As an airplane lover it is fun to see old planes that have long since disappeared, hopefully a few  having been preserved somewhere.  This movie contains an abundance of Pan-Am Aircraft filmed flying through the skies of South America including a lot of scenes showing the exterior and brief glimpses of the cockpit of the original China Clipper as it takes off and flies around the San Francisco Bay area.  There is a beautiful shot during 1935 (?) of the original Bay Bridge still under construction (correct me if I'm wrong) as well as Fishermans Wharf and of course the Golden Gate Bridge.  Those scene alone where worth watching the whole movie.",1407974400,6,1559,4.698529411764706
5253907,5,B00936A2SW,Great movie!  Had just read a book on Wake Island and the building of the Pan American facilities there so was interesting.,1407715200,,123,4.590909090909091
5253908,3,B00936A2SW,I enjoy old movies and old aircraft so this movie has a lot going for it.  The pace of the movie a bit slow and is still entertaining.  I would recommend this movie to people who also enjoy old movies and old planes.  This is a early role for Humphrey Bogart too.,1402876800,,263,4.019230769230769
5253909,5,B00936A2SW,"China Clipper is at least loosely or partly based on the true story of how Juan Trippe founded Pan American Airways and made it an international, giant airline with countless routes the world over before it very sadly went out of business. True, the film starts with a statement that the characters and incidents are purely fictitious, but a close look at some of the airplanes shows you the Pan Am logo on them and both the character of Dave Logan in this film along with the events truly resemble the history of Juan Trippe and his founding of Pan Am! The plot moves along well and I was very impressed with the fine performances all the actors turn outeveryone in this film is well cast, too! The sets are terrific and look for some stunning, fascinating aerial footage including some footage showing the original Martin M-130 China Clipper Flying Boat aircraft flying over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge while the bridge was under construction! Moreover, the cinematography and choreography reflect good forethought and the use of lighting enhances the movie as well.

When the action starts, we meet Dave Logan (Pat OBrien) who has just returned home by ocean liner and he happily meets his wife Jean (Beverly Roberts) who he sometimes calls Skippy or Skip. Dave is amazed and extremely impressed by Charles Lindberghs flight from New York to Parisbefore that it had seemed impossible to fly such distances safely with any time saving as opposed to taking an ocean liner for overseas travel! In fact, Dave is so impressed and inspired by Lindberghs accomplishment he quits his job and becomes inspired and drivenreally drivento start commercial aviation. Dave is joined by his buddies Hap Stuart (Humphrey Bogart) and Tom Collins (Ross Alexander); and theres the somewhat frail, elderly but highly intelligent and hardworking engineer Dad Brunn (Henry B. Walthall) who also believes in Daves dream although Dave sometimes fights hard with people he needs and/or truly loves including Jean and Hap as he almost maniacally makes his dream of commercial aviation into a reality by pushing everybody he can including a principal financial backer. Dave also wants an extensive training course for his pilots and whenever Dave and his men achieve a goal Dave wants a flight route that is more ambitious and he never takes no for an answer. Dave never even thanks anybody helping him, either! Dave is convinced that it is critically important to beat other nations to getting a historic, prestigious and lucrative transpacific air route between the West Coast of the United States to China!

You know how this is going to turn out but its fascinating to see the story unfold anyway. A few unexpected plot twists helped to hold my attention including the wonderful aerial photography of actual airplanes in flight that I mentioned above.

In addition, look for solid performances by Marie Wilson as Sunny Avery; Joseph Crehan as Jim Horn; Joe King as Mr. Pierson; Addison Richards as Mr. B.C. Hill; Ruth Robinson as Mother Brunn; Carlyle Moore Jr. as a radio operator on the China Clipper; Lyle Moraine as the co-pilot on the China Clipper; Wayne Morris as the China Clipper navigator; Alexander Cross as Bill Andrews; Kenneth Harlan as a Department of Commerce Inspector and Milburn Stone plays a radio operator. Look closely and youll see Frank Faylen in an uncredited role as a weatherman. Youll also see Guam and Midway Island before we became involved in World War Twowhat changes those islands saw during and after the war!

China Clipper is a wonderful film for fans of the principal actors in it and people who like dramas essentially based on real life stories will not be disappointed.",1396137600,6,3698,4.940514469453376
5253910,4,B00936A2SW,"This is a fictionalized account of the spread of airlines through South American and across the Pacific.

5253914,5,B00936A2SW,"Absolutely a jewel of a movie.  The acting and plot is not up to todays standards, but that is part of its beauty.
Bogart actually looks like Ed Musick and the actor that played Joan Trippe, looked like him too.  I really enjoyed the movie, although it was quite dramatized with much creative license, the history is still there and it just brings you back in time.
I will be watching this again and again.",1365811200,,406,4.4
5253915,4,B00936A2SW,"An ok movie with an utterly fascinating backdrop.  A completely unique time in our country's history, a Post-WWI/Pre-WWII glimpse of aviation in America, and a reminder that development of anything new and transcendent comes at significant personal cost.

The allright story completely redeems itself by featuring those that wrote the aviation manuals, drew up the radio procedures, built the Seaplane ports, and further charted a 3rd dimension to the maps.
Good pix and sound, and anyone interested in aviation development will enjoy this.",1356998400,,540,5.493975903614458
5253916,5,B00936A2SW,"This movie has the only available moving pictures of the Martin 301 flying boat.  As a model builder, this previously long-unavailable movie provides me otherwise unavailable information about the aircraft as it was actually built. In addition there are priceless sequences of vintage air traffic (Ford trimotors, etc.) activities at the very dawn of commercial aviation. The plot also is a thinly disguised (the early Pan Am logo is on several of the aircraft) and deserved ode to Juan Tripp and his heroic efforts to build commercial intrnational aviation. By all  accounts he was truly driven. Finally, the movie triggers a truly eerie feeling as one looks at Guam and Midway in the late 1930''s as PRE WW II sleepy, quaint seaplane refueling stations.  What an absolutely incredible change all of the above would experience in the next 10 years.. In sum, for the early aviation enthusiast, this is a treasure trove with unique  content!  .",1356566400,17,943,5.019230769230769

5253918,5,B00936A2SW,"China Clipper is an exciting film for aviation history buffs. The story is a fictionalized retelling of the birth of Pan Am, and in some scenes the Pan Am logo is visible on the airplanes. Pat O'Brien is perfect as the man possessed by his vision of an airline that connects the continents. Humphrey Bogart is fun in a supporting role as the ace pilot who can fly the big airships through hurricanes and typhoons. Ross Alexander also appears in a major supporting role, an actor who showed great promise but was tragically cut short. This movie is a must-have for those who love old airplanes, and the aerial shot flying over Miami's Dinner Key terminal (now the Miami City Hall) is a real treat.",1355529600,4,696,4.576
5253919,5,B00936A2SW,"I have wanted this movie since I was in grade school, that was 60 years ago, the movie is complete and a better copy reproduction with no flaws, I have always loved this movie.",1354924800,6,176,4.205882352941177
5253920,4,B00936A2SW,"Okay, if you're a standard film buff, this may not be your cup of tea. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie either. As the other reviewers have opined, it's an okay period piece. It was a major break-out role for Humphrey Bogart but nothing special. However, if like me, you are a CLIPPER WING Nut - one who loves anything about the early Pan American Flying Boat Clippers  - you will truly enjoy CHINA CLIPPER.

The late great Pan American Airlines was heavily involved in every aspect of the 1936 production and provided much of the flying footage. The movie features most of the Pan Am era flying boats like the Sikorsky S-42 - Pan American Clipper, the Martin M-130 - China Clipper, a Douglas Dolphin Amphibian, and many more. There are great shots of the S.S. North Haven and the men who unloaded equipment on the open ocean to construct flying boat bases from two Pacific desert islands. There are also excellent shots of Alameda Airport, California and Pan American Lagoon, where the China Clippers operated until they moved to Clipper Cove for the 1939 World Exposition at Treasure Island.

CHINA CLIPPER is worth a watch if you're in the mood for a period piece movie It's great if you're hooked on the romance of the Golden Age of Aviation and the Era of the Great Flying Boats.

Cheers! Jamie

8535050,3,B00936A2SW,"Oi!  This film could have been so fun, instead it might have well as been named ""Cliche Clipper"".  If you're a fan of early B&W talkies as I've been, you're familiar with the rapid fire dialog, the moment(s) in so many films where someone goes off on a ""Gee mister, if you only understood, there are people who need this work, people depending on us, and if you just give us a chance...""  a stirring speech, often with a clenched fist and very often followed by a spectacular Busby Berkeley number.  In this film it never stops.  Pat O'Brien, who plays something of the role of Juan Tripp, the founder of Pan Am.  Given the exigencies of Depression Era story telling, there is no Boeing, no Martin, and no Sikorsky only Duncan's very old dad (Duncan being Tripps movie name) who designs all the planes and everybody from bankers to plane designers to even old Dad gets the pep talk or the rousing speech.  Bogart is on the cusp of stardom---here he has got his role down, his look, his persona everything but the star role which is just around the corner.

There are some great plane shots, especially when they finally get to the China Clippers and San Francisco (Alameda).  There's a strange shot where the plane takes off, flies over the Ferry Building and then, oddly enough is then shown flying west over the Bay Bridge, which is east of the Ferry Building...  But in my mind I kept humming ""Rio...flying off to Rio"" because the music was missing.  Or the Lindbergh film where Jimmy Stewart tries to stay awake as the Spirit of St Louis makes the long Atlantic solo crossing.

On the other hand, there is lots of silence.  Good scenes that are allowed to unfold in front of the viewer with the viewer trusted to interpret the data correctly---today a John Williams score or clone of one would be blasting out of the speakers driving us to where the director wants us to go, no trust whatsoever.

You could clean the house or cook a meal or do all sorts of things with this in the back ground.  As a sit down and watch it's a bit of a stretch, unless of course you're snowed in and have absolutely nothing to do and your satellite dish is out.",1510790400,,2147,4.427480916030534
