Cheeky! - This is a beautiful movie, if one likes the female form. The movie's star is gorgeous with no silicon or evidence of a personal trainer. There is a plot, but it doesn't get in the way of the movie very much. The dialog is stupid, but sincere. They don't make movies like this anymore and I doubt that they ever will.

Black Angel - I was quite amazed by this passionate, old-fashioned style tragic romance. The costumes, the cinematography, Ennio Morricone's sweeping score, all come together to create an absolute classic of it's genre. Anna Galiena and Gabriel Garko are beautiful together as doomed lovers that find each other in the desperate, waning days of the second World War. Helmut Schulz, played by the impossibly sensual Garko, is a sleazy and corrupt young SS officer, addicted to gambling, women, and to other of life's excesses. His decadent lifestyle does not come cheap, and when the beautiful but lonely Livia, (in an amazingly elegant performance by the wonderful Anna Galiena) offers to financially support Helmut, the amoral man does not refuse. Director Tinto Brass photographs the present day in glorious black and white, while we see, in blazing color the erotic love affair as it unfolded, in a series of flashbacks described by Livia, while en route to Venice. ""Senso 45/Black Angel"" is Tinto Brass' most serious work. It seems like he wanted to create something impressive here, and he did just that. A much more accomplished film than his ""Salon Kitty."" Effectively capturing the decadence of Fascist Italy, 1945 in a dizzying orgy scene, filled with graphic and strange sexuality and drug taking, a trademark of Tinto Brass, and unforgettable images of Anna and her SS lover in desperate embraces in shadowy back alleys or sparse rooms, with rays of sunlight filtering through lace curtains. It is hard to describe the beauty and elegance of this film. For fans of erotic romance, and films that possess this specifically European style of film making, this intoxicating art-house film is certain to impress.

Private - Is a collection of six stories based on the joys of sexuality and the eroticism of a new generation of women. This movie lives up what you expect of Tinto Brass. Sexy, Funny, Irreverent! Not Much else To Say.

Monamour - Dario is a little publisher from Milano. He is joining the Mantova Festival Letteratura (Book fair) 2004. Marta, his unsatisfied wife, accompanies him. Leon is a French designer-photographer. While Dario is busy with his own business, Marta take a visit to the celebrated Palazzo Te; here under Giulio Romano's fresco representing Jupiter's erected penis she meets Leon. Immediately they become lovers and spend the entire book exhibitions' days making love almost everywhere. I admire Tinto Brass For his courage as well as talent to go all the way in his work without holding back. Tinto didn't give a damn about taboo. But what he did was art, what others did is porn. Genius aren't imitable.",1419811200,10,3072,4.913294797687861
6425261,5,B00KGGFHFG,"Americans just don't get the cinema of Tinto Brass, but I love him.  He's a left-over anarchist from the 1960's who disguises himself as a maker of sexy films.  Make no mistake - Tinto's film are right up to the line of pornography, but he doesn't cross that line.  Instead, he creates a world in which women are the equal of men, and who can cheat and tease just as bad as the men.  'Cheeky' has a young girl wandering through London, getting into sexual misadventures, 'Monamour' has a young woman in Venice get into fidelity issues, and 'Private' are short humorous films about people resolving sex issues.  'Black Angel' is the best of this group, concerning a married middle aged woman circa 1945 who gets in over her head during an affair with a younger handsome Gestapo officer, and the results of that affair - the movie is an updating of the Italian classic 'Senso' and very well done.  As a bonus, there is 90 minute discussion with Tinto about his entire career, and the man is charming.  The blu-rays look and sound great and the price is very attractive.  This is art parading as smut, very European and very entertaining.",1412726400,8,1135,4.584158415841584
6425262,5,B00KGGFHFG,"Pornography is there to give you an erection. Erotica is there to give you emotions. Tinto Brass

Cheeky! Carla (Yuliya Mayarchuk) goes to London for a four week internship. Her boyfriend Matteo is the jealous type and he is going to join her at a later time in London. Carla shortly after her arrival in London has several suitors men and women who want her affection. Will Carla be able to remain faithful or will she crumble to her desires before Matteo arrives?

Tinto Brass original started his career directing art house films before shifting into erotic cinema in the 1970s. His films have always been soft core romps that come close but never cross the line into full blown hard core sex films. A lot has changed in the thirty plus years Brass has been directing these types of films as the soft core market has all but dried up except for may be cable TV with the focus going towards making hardcore films. There is almost too many hardcore films being produce and might I add poorly being directed by talent less hacks who have no idea how to direct erotic scenes without ever being vulgar. Tinto Brass is the last of dying bread as his film are not only beautifully photographed they are also some of the most sensual images ever committed to celluloid.

Trasgredire also known as Cheeky! is a film about a temptress named Carla. The film opens with a scene where a man flashes his penis at Carla as she walks through the park. No fazed or bashful in the least Carla shows him her privates before turning around and flashing him her ass. This scene quickly establishes the Carla character as a sexual being that obsesses over sex. Brass also fleshes out the rest of the main character like Carlas boyfriend Matteo and her lesbian lover Moira. This film also marks the first time Tinto Brass fully explored in any of his films a lesbian relationship between two main characters.

Two stand out scenes in the film are one when Clara and Moira are at a party and when they arrive they are several women with their asses in the air bent over a couch as men walk by choose which one they want. Brass is truly knows the beauty of womans ass as he captures this moment in a breath taking tracking shot. The other stand out moment is when Clara is having a playful romp of the beach with a former French lover. This scene is actually told as a flashback; still it is by the far the most erotic moment in the film.

Pino Donaggio supplies a playful score that is just so damn catchy the motifs will stay with you for days. The films also boasts some lavish sets and locations that really open up this film. Every composition is artfully done by Brass who uses every inch of the frame. Brass proves with Cheeky! that his still has the Midas touch as he creates another erotic masterpiece.

Black Angel: The wife of a prominent member of Fascist party begins a torrid affair with a manipulate German lieutenant.

Key collaborators on Black Angel include cinematographers Daniele Nannuzzi (Santa Sangre) and Massimo Di Venanzo (All Ladies Do It, Cheeky!) and yet another exceptional score from composer Ennio Morricone who had previously worked with Brass on the film The Key.

Though Black Angel is based on Camillo Boitos novel Senso, the same source novel that Luchino Visconti sourced for his 1954 film also tilted Senso. They are hardly mirror images of each other. With that being said, there are more than a few differences in regards to these two film adaptions then the eras from which they are sent in. Most notably how Brasss film delves deeper into politics and of course oozing over with explicit sexuality that has all but become synonymous with his cinema legacy.

Narrative wise Brass has employed an interesting way to divulge what is occurring onscreen. Periodically throughout the film there are black and white sequences which alternate with the predominately color sequences. And it is precisely these black and white moments that make give this film its durable backbone. Also the black and white sequences are set in the present, while the color sequences are all memories from the protagonists torrid past. To further accentuate the differences between these two narratives the majority of the decadent behavior takes place in living color, while the more dramatic moments that ultimately decide ones fate take place in glorious black and white.

As mentioned before all of the hallmarks that one would expect from a Brass film are all on display in Black Angel and as usual Brass creates many extraordinary compositions throughout. One of this films most memorable moments is a orgy party sequence where the protagonist is hanging out with her Nazi lover and his cohorts. This sexually charged moment of debauchery at times has an almost Federico Fellini feel to it.

When it comes to casting Brass films are known more for their voluptuous leading ladies. To my surprise that is not the case with Black Angel which has arguably the best cast that Brass ever had the chance to work with. The entire cast all very good in their respective roles, especially this films two main characters Anna Galiena (Nothing Underneath) in the role of a bored housewife named Livia Mazzoni and Gabriel Garko in the role of her lover a Nazi lieutenant named Helmut Schultz. The scenes they are in are filled with a tremendous amount of heat. One more moment of praise for this films leading lady Anna Galiena who does not rely heavily on her natural assets as previous Brass leading ladies. In fact she dominates all the more dramatic moments in the film. Ultimately Black Angel is Brasss most satisfying mix of erotica and melodrama to date.

Private is a collection of six tales in which couples share with their affairs. The first story titled Alibi is about a couple who are celebrating their seven year wedding anniversary in Morocco. The wife one morning tells her husband about her last visit which in turn makes him aroused by the thought of other men touching and sleeping with his wife. The husband asks the bell boy who he caught watching his wife is he would like to sleep with his wife and of course we all know his answer. The second story titled Double Trouble is about a pair of spouses who are sleeping with each other spouses. The third story titled Two hearts and a Hut is about a German couple with weird sexual fetishes who pay the hotels maid generous amounts of money to be their plaything. The maid convinces her boyfriend that she was doing it all for him and that with the money they made they can open up their own bed and breakfast.

The fourth story titled Jolly Bangs takes place on a beach where a wife tells her husbands about her past affairs which only make him hornier. The fifth story titled Evil to Him who thinks Evil is about a couple who are engaged to be married. He wants to have anal sex with his fiance who wants to wait until they are married. Also she is afraid of having his extremely large penis in her ass. They are invited to a party with another couple who are swingers and one thing leads to another the fiance lets the other man do her in the ass. The sixth story titled Call Me a Pig I like It is about

Private is an uneven film that suffers mostly due to the various segments being either too short or not that well fleshed out. Tinto Brass direction is nearly flawless as it is mind blowing just how many ways he can frame the female enmity especially the ass. Private has a lot of scenes in which ladies give their male lovers oral sex. All but one of these scenes oddly enough involves the use of prosthetic penises. The characters in the film all come off stuck up which at times classes with the films dark humor.

The first and last stories both end with amusing climaxes. The weakest story is Two hearts and a Hut which is nothing more than several random sequences related to bondage. The films off beat score ads to the films eclectic mix of stories. Overall Private doesnt quite work despite following the Tinto Brass formula, still it is not without its own merits as brief moments of Tinto Brass brilliance are scattered throughout the film.

Monamour: Unable to find sexual fulfillment with her husband, a woman begins a torrid affair with a stranger who she met at a museum.

Over the last four decades Tinto Brass has steadily cranked out some of the best erotica themed films. With his masterpiece of erotica cinema being The Key. Content wise, he rarely ventures away from his bread butter, beautiful women, their asss and voyeuristic approach to his visuals.

Plot wise, this is not one of Tinto Brasss stronger efforts. As the story retreads subject matter that he has explored in his previous films. The vapid plot is not helped by the one dimensional characters which populate this story. Just about the only thing surprising about this film, is its ending.

At least visually this films tries to keep things interesting. With the stand out moments visually being a scene where the films main character Marta, the woman having an affair and her friend at a health spa. Another stand out moment being a scene where Marta dances seductively for and making love to her lover in front of a crowd of onlookers. The most interesting moment visually, is a bizarre dream sequence that has an over exposed look to it.

The sex scenes, which feature a slew of rubber peniss. Tend to be raunchier than what one would expect from a Tinto Brass. Performance wise none of the cast leave a lasting impression and they are at best adequate. Ultimately outside of a few memorable moments, Monamour is an underwhelming experience that feels all to familiar.

8658397,3,B00KGGFHFG,"The quality varies a lot between these four films.  I mean they all have the look of Tinto Brass (costumes, sets, locations, cinematography, incredibly stunning women with naturally voluptuous figures...)  But they aren't all erotic in the same way.

Cheeky I had already bought individually as soon as I found it on Blu-ray; it's still one of my favorites from Tinto Brass and one of his most explicit (lots and lots and lots of female genitals and even one finger insertion clip that is satisfyingly graphic and not too brief).  So I was taking a chance with these other three...

Black Angel is a good movie, interesting story and so forth ... but as eroticism it's really tame on the whole.  Clearly pantomime and little explicit nudity - and the one scene with an orgy has so many cuts all over the place that nothing is on screen long enough to stimulate much (there were a few flashes of activity that I really wanted to see more of, but it dances across the screen and then vanishes).  It actually gave me the feeling that this is censored somehow (even though it probably isn't) - it makes a lot of hints at something it then fails to show.

Private is the most disappointing since I have seen some of the full scenes that it clipped together - the short of Do It in particular, all of the fully explicit action has been cut out.  That theme was maintained through all of the shorts... lots of fake action that you can clearly see isn't real (particularly any pretense of performing oral).

Monamour I had at least seen online once, and I guess the novelty of it intrigued me more than actually watching it at Blu-ray quality and having some idea of what was going to happen.  It has a lot of strong sexual situations and generous use of the Tinto Brass Phallus in many scenes, but again it's all pretend, with varying levels of convincing action (mostly, not convincing... one shot at the very end sort of looks real but you can still tell it isn't).  This was rather frustrating since it got so fake and so silly that you end up not believing the whole scene, the whole emotional performance... it all becomes ridiculous.",1445644800,5,2132,4.537859007832898
