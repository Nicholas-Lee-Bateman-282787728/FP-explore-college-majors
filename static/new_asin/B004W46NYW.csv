He makes you work hard.  At the end of this workout, you know that you have worked hard because you are dripping with sweat.  This is the type of workout that made me like Jari Love in the first place.",1312243200,2,365,4.013888888888889

8611832,5,B004W46NYW,Love this workout. For anyone with limited amount of time this workout is perfect. The 30 min workouts make you sweat. I feel like I get a full hour workout in 30 minutes. Definetly shaping up faster than I have with any other workout. I have her other workouts-but this one is the best.  To get the best benefits I recommend using a step which they show in the video. Great for a glute workout.  I was using the PX90 but did not have time for 1 hour workouts 6 days. Found this works faster and better!,1308614400,4,503,4.175257731958763
