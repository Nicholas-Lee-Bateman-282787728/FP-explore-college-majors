6759380,5,B00OQRUACQ,One of the best series on T.V. right now.  Great art.  And I love that it has a positive message with a strong female cast.  My biggest gripe is the DVD format.  Why does Cartoon Network insist on mixing up the order of the episodes and short-changing buyers with partial seasons?  With a show like this where story progression is already a little confusing it only makes things more difficult for the kids to follow.  Come on Cartoon Network.  Everyone gripes about your DVD's.  Listen to the customers and give us entire seasons or at least episodes in chronological order people.,1485820800,2,582,4.693069306930693

6759382,4,B00OQRUACQ,"I like the selection of episodes, but as others have said, they are in random order, and for Steven Universe, that makes no sense. It needs to be released in a linear edition, since even filler episodes are fairly rife with clues to future episodes, and easter eggs that only make sense if you're watching in order.
Would love to see a linear box set when the series concludes.",1484352000,,377,4.478260869565218

Great show all around, and a nice collection of episodes (plus the pilot!). However, the episodes are out of order, and some have not been included at all. This show has many little ""hints"" that it drops in each episode, and when you skip an episode, or play them out of order, the greater plot can become confusing.

6759406,5,B00OQRUACQ,"A beautifully drawn, smoothly animated, richly imagined series that focuses on a boy left without his mother in a reality that isn't completely his own. Watching Steven handle the oddities of his life with a never ending sense of good humor and innocence is always more than enough to put a smile on my face. Few children's' shows do as good a job of illustrating healthy and unhealthy relationships and explaining why they are on either end of the spectrum.",1455148800,,458,4.7375
6759407,4,B00OQRUACQ,"Great show however the DVD is missing episodes that are important to the continuity, like Steven the sword fighter, which gives one character a new outfit, and someone who hadnt seen the show before may be confused without seeing this.

Thank you Regular show and Adventure Time for making poorly drawn ADHD brain food like this popular.  Someday people will look back on this and wonder what was in the water we were drinking.

6759412,5,B00OQRUACQ,"this  show is one of the best pieces of animation in the history of history. The show is about the crystal gems who are the protectors of earth after a big war who are garnet,amethyest,pearl,and steven. The how is mostly from stevens perspective as he and the other gems go on adventures to protect earth and stuff. The animation is great,the stories are wonderfully made,and the charecters are interesting and funny.

6759424,5,B00OQRUACQ,"Steven Universe was a show I dismissed at first, lumping it in with other ""weird, stupid"" new Cartoon Network shows like Uncle Grandpa. How wrong I was. Rebecca Sugar has created one of the finest works of American Animation, standing with other greats like Samurai Jack, Teen Titans, and Avatar/Legend of Korra. This is not an exaggeration; the animation, character development, story arcs, and music are all expertly crafted. I'd also like to highlight the excellent pacing: taking a Cowboy Bebop/Last Airbender approach, where ""filler"" is anything but.

The only problem with this release is the lack of order, and seemingly arbitrary choice of episodes. It starts off alright, with episodes 1&2 but quickly skips around. Luckily, it's early enough in the series where only 1 major plot point is missing (I wonder why Pearl looks different in Beach Party, Rose's Room and Steven & The Stevens...)

Hopefully Cartoon Network will soon give this series what it deserves: a full Season 1 Blu Ray/DVD release a la Adventure Time.",1440028800,3,1028,5.076923076923077
6759425,4,B00OQRUACQ,"I was a bit disappointed with this, even though I love Steven Universe.

Most everything was fine with it, but it skipped some episodes!!!  Granted, these episodes aren't necessary to the plot, I was still very miffed when I found out.  It even skipped Sword Fighting Steven!

If you've already seen the episodes, this is fine for adding it to your collection, but I would not use this to introduce anyone to the series.",1438992000,7,420,4.635135135135135
6759426,5,B00OQRUACQ,A good show that highlights a non traditional family structure. Teaches good life lessons too. Love it.,1438214400,5,103,5.117647058823529
6759427,4,B00OQRUACQ,I only bought this because I want Cartoon Network to know that people like this series and are willing to buy their test run DVD. Hopefully enough people will buy this and CN will be encouraged to make a season 1. When that comes out I'll buy it and probably give this DVD as a gift to a younger SU fan.,1438128000,,303,3.9836065573770494
6759428,2,B00OQRUACQ,This cartoon is high quality in many ways. How unfortunate and sad that the creators would use it as a platform to project their views on sexuality.  It is inappropriate for cartoon characters to explore same sex and queer themes. These are issues best left to parents' discretion who are able to tailor discussions to individual children.,1437955200,,339,4.947368421052632

He is what is known as a ""Crystal Gem"" like his fellow teammates Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl.  His teammates activate special weapons and powers thanks to their Crystal Gem abilities, but Steven has a lot to learn about being one himself.  In this visually appealing series from Cartoon Network, join Steven and friends as they have many adventures in the seaside town of Beach City and beyond the stars in 12 cosmic episodes such as:

""Laser Light Cannon"" - A giant eyeball-like monster is looming over the city and the only way to defeat it is a special laser cannon from Rose Quartz, Steven's mother.  But it's deep inside a storage shed owned by Greg, Steven's dad.
""Gem Glow"" - After eating his favorite ice cream sandwich, Steven suddenly summons a gem shield.  Now he has to figure out how to summon his weapon again.
""Bubble Buddies"" - Steven saves a girl named Connie by protecting her in a bubble that he has a hard time deactivating after saving her.
""Tiger Millionaire"" - Steven discovers that Amethyst is taking part in an underground wrestling federation and wants to support her.
""Giant Woman"" - On one of their quests, Steven yearns to see Pearl and Amethyst to fuse together and see what happens.
""Beach Party"" - After accidentally destroying a local business, Steven makes it up to the business's family by throwing a party with the Gems.
""Steven and the Stevens"" - When everyone else has no time to play for Steven's band, he decides to make it his own (literally) by using a time-travel device.

Also in this volume, check out the original pilot episode of ""Steven Universe"" where at one moment the title character sings the theme song to this series.

6759455,4,B00OQRUACQ,"On one hand I'm incredibly glad that I purchased this DVD because I don't watch TV regularly and this was a way for me to watch the episodes in my own time.  It's good quality, and it includes the pilot episode as a bonus feature, which is cool.  I couldn't get it to play on my computer's disc drive, but that may be different for you; it worked just fine in a regular DVD player, anway.

On the other hand I'm pretty - actually, really - disappointed that these aren't consecutive episodes, since I was under the impression that what I was going to be buying was a chunk of the first season.  Which I guess it was, but not the way I thought it was going to be?  I don't like that this is very commonly the way that cartoons series are packaged and sold - cut up into weird chunks and what have you.

This disc contains episodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, and 22 (going by the wikipedia page for the show).  Watching this disc was really my first time watching the show so I didn't know until later that I wasn't seeing everything.  It skipped some of what I now know to be my favorites, and if I had known that this was the way the DVD was going to be arranged I would have probably just waited until I had some way of purchasing the complete first season, all together.  I'm still glad I bought it, don't get me wrong; I just would have liked to know what was up.",1427673600,6,1378,4.055350553505535

6759469,5,B00OQRUACQ,"I bought a copy of this DVD, and now I'm back to buy 3 more and ship them to my younger relatives as presents. I'm not even kidding. It's that good.

I've been a fan of cartoons for decades now, and this without a doubt my favorite. This show is incredible. It's great for both kids and adults, as the entire show is shown through the eyes of Steven, a cheerful young boy with untapped magical powers.

The songs are delightful, the characters are colorful and vibrant, and the stories are a masterful blend of happy-and-sad, magical-and-real, childlike-and-intense.

Yes, I hope cartoon network releases the entire season, in order, on DVD. But in the meantime, I have no qualms about purchasing this excellent mix-pack. Well, purchasing it 4x :D",1426636800,2,747,4.775193798449612

6759473,5,B00OQRUACQ,"I love this show. The music is amazing, they actually release most of the soundtrack online! The animation is fun and really appealing. It looks like a goofy kid show but the series starts to become pretty deep. Older kids, adults and the parents who actually bother to sit down and watch tv with their kids should be able to use it as a great conversation starter.",1425340800,,365,4.462686567164179

6759496,5,B00OQRUACQ,"I am 21 years old and I absolutely ADORE this show! It's fantastic for kids and adults alike! Steven Universe follows the every day antics of a magical boy named (you guessed it) Steven Universe as he tries his darnedest to learn how to use his magical powers. He lives with his 3 magical friends Pearl, Garnet, and Amethyst (who his mother entrusted them to care for her child after she gave up her physical form to create him) who are constantly saving him from situations that he inevitably gets himself in (or helps him get into in the case of Amethyst). This show is hilarious and all forms of silly but also has a very touching and sometimes serious side to it.
Overall this show is GREAT. I recommend everyone, young and old alike watch this show!
[EDIT] It's been about 3 hours since I wrote this review and I AM STILL WATCHING THIS SHOW. I had N O  I D E A that this DVD was so LONG!! This is great!!",1424649600,,909,4.254335260115607

6759500,3,B00OQRUACQ,"Steven Universe is my all time favorite children's show at this point. My issue is with the dvd itself. Cartoon Network likes to do this thing where they release dvds of random, mixed order episodes (which I didn't understand before buying it).
The episodes are as follows in the order on the dvd, labeled with the actual order in the show:

2 Laser Light Canon
1 Gem Glow
6 Cat Fingers
7 Bubble Buddies
9 Tiger Millionaire
10 Steven's Lion
15 Onion Trade
12 Giant Woman
14 Lars and the Cool Kids
19 Rose's Room
18 Beach Party
22 Steven and the Stevens

This is technically missing 10 episodes if it's containing episodes between 1 and 22, and 5 if it really held 1 - 12 as it says.

As episodic as SU is, there is a slow revealing plot as the show progresses, and the characters' relationships build episode by episode, so watching them out of order is not ideal in the grand scheme of the show. I'd recommend waiting for a full box set of the first season to get the right order of 52 episodes.",1423785600,314,996,4.287234042553192
6759501,4,B00OQRUACQ,"For now, this is the best DVD for fans of Steven Universe. This disc contains the pilot, which is always a treat.
The only problem is that the pilot is the only special feature and this is simply just a best of collection. Let's hope the executives notice the DVD sales and greenlight a Blu-Ray of the complete season one when it finishes airing.",1423612800,4,346,4.421875
6759502,5,B00OQRUACQ,"This is one of the most creative and sweet shows out right now.

6759505,4,B00OQRUACQ,"I'm not giving this a 4 because of any problems with shipping or etc., I'm giving it a 4 because the episodes aren't in chronological order and some episodes are missing.
 This show may mostly be episodic, but it's just kinda silly that the second episode is the first on the DVD and the first episode is the second.
 Other than this a pleasent product very much worth it to support one of the last good cartoons that Cartoon Network shows.",1422144000,3,440,4.419753086419753

6759517,5,B00OQRUACQ,"A wonderful series by Cartoon Network. Everything about this show hits the spot; the writing, the voice acting, music, characters, voice acting design, color choices, jokes, everything. It's full of messages of positivity, friendship, and being yourself, along with themes that there are grey areas in morality and  imperfections are to be embraced. It might also be one of the few network shows to have a large female and non-binary cast, and that fact is handled very well.
If you are a fan of the show or have never seen it I highly recommend purchasing this DVD and supporting the series.
I am a bit disappointed that there wasn't a commercial advertising this on Cartoon Network and that I had to learn about the release almost a week after launch. Hopefully in the future this won't happen again.",1421798400,,802,4.811594202898551
6759518,5,B00OQRUACQ,"Steven Universe is everything I ever wanted in a cartoon show as a kid. Fun times, a colorful atmosphere, smart writing and characters, teaches great lessons but doesn't take itself too seriously, and a story with some history and just a little bit of mystery that slowly grows. What is a Gem? You'll think you know. But you won't. Steven is just learning. But I promise you that finding out will be fun! I hope we get the whole season soon, and much more in the future!",1421625600,10,470,4.413793103448276

With wonderful, likable characters, engaging stories, and beautiful backgrounds this show is must watch! I love that the characters genuinely seem to love and care for one another, which I miss seeing in shows nowadays. The show is very sweet and endearing, and it will leave you with warm feelings inside. The only complaint I have is that this disc does not contain a full season, but has some very good episodes. Cartoon Network seems to have a hard time deciding what shows are worth promoting. I cannot stress enough how absolutely wonderful this show is!",1421625600,13,673,4.760683760683761
6759521,5,B00OQRUACQ,"This show is easily one of the best in Cartoon Network's lineup. It has great artwork, delightfully wonderful and diverse characters, and an interesting and often touching storyline. Steven Universe and its characters exude genuine and earnest positivity with every episode that leaves me, and others like me, feeling happy in a way that other shows and animations have not been able to do for a long time. I really love this show and would definitely recommend it for parents and children alike. I know that once this DVD comes, my nieces and nephews and I are going to have a bit of a marathon together in hopes that they too will believe in Steven.",1421625600,16,651,4.6695652173913045

Steven Universe is the best thing to happen to Cartoon Network (and cartoons in general!) in years. It's progressive, the characters are endearing, and the production quality is spectacular. Not to mention the music! Everything comes together so well and most of my week is spent waiting for thursdays so I can see what happens next. Steven Universe is a show that does not exclude. It's not a boys show or a girl's show. It's not for children or adults. It's for everyone, and I just can't put into words how happy it makes me that it exists.",1421625600,12,631,4.448275862068965

There is still hope yet with cartoons like these. the characters are distinguished and colourful, there is wonderful animation at work and it is brilliant .its fun for kids and adults alike. this show doesn't assume the intelligence of children and allows them to grasp concepts that are otherwise dumbed down in other current cartoons. I really hope this stays on the air because it's the best thing ive seen since i was a kid.",1421625600,38,466,4.626506024096385
