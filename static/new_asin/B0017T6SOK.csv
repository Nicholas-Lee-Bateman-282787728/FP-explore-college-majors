Wish there were more examples of what a ""logical Consequence"" is for behaviors (like throwing your potty chair-after using it- across the living room).  That's my biggest challenge, to come up with something in the heat of the tantrum/moment (usually when I'm in a hurry and not in the mood to be the calm ""I have all the time in the world to wait for you to get it together"" Mama.  The book is awesome!  If I had to choose between the two I'd definitely pick the Love and Logic book for toddlers.",1307923200,,599,4.36036036036036
8267195,3,B0017T6SOK,"The L&L Solutions video I bought did not seem to jump out at my wife and I as other L&L videos and CDs. It was okay and should benefit those with children within the ages addressed in the video. Also, Dr. Fey seemed to be a little off. Just not one of the best. But I do recommend L&L and this review should not sway parents away from the concept.",1304035200,,347,3.9714285714285715
8267196,5,B0017T6SOK,"Love this DVD!  I teach the Love and Logic parenting program and often use clips from this DVD to illustrate pertinent points.  Best of all, parents tell me that they love it!  They comment on its usefulness, the humor in which it is made, and that they have fun watching and learning about how be more effective parents.",1299888000,3,321,4.5
