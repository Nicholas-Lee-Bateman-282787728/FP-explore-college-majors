8705117,2,B00UB4Z3TI,"I was disappointed. I was expecting music. Have never run into a music artist's DVD being other than a new release of music.  I get that she's popular. I love her music but putting out a DVD with her life story right after her first DVD? Really? Maybe when she's been in the business for 20 years and still churning the hits out, I could see it but at the beginning of her career? That's a bit much IMHO.",1436400000,4,404,4.113924050632911
8705118,4,B00UB4Z3TI,"I love Meghan, and although this isn't just music videos, it's really fascinating to hear her speaking about her music and her career. Great DVD!",1435017600,3,145,4.84
