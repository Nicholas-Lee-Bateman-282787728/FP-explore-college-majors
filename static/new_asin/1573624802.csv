At the time it was a somewhat edgy little teen comedy that made fun of the gay coming out process in a very very cute way. I remember I was about the same age and had  a major crush on the star.  So I couldn't resist stepping back into the past and having a laugh.

As usual, this movie is filled with teen angst and romantic struggles as an average teenage boy discovers that he's been turned into a vampire!  It's fun to see Robert Sean Leonard so young.

193156,5,1573624802,"I watched this movie a lot when I was younger and for a time I had a copy of it on VHS and then lost it again when I completely switched to DVD's and because it hadn't been released on DVD I despaired at ever seeing it again.

The acting is light but believable and David Warner (very good character actor) adds a little something extra to the movie.

I recommend this to any fan of the 80's, comedy fans, people who want to watch something light and of course vampire fans.

This movie is safe for teens but because of some of the risque humor and adult situations it's not safe for small children.

I have two complaints about this version, the first is the previews there's one for a very very scary movie that you want to be ready with the 'menu' button on your remote if you don't like scary movies or you're watching this movie with a teenager.

The second is that no soundtrack was released for this movie either songs or an original score and really...they should release them.

Thank you for reading my review.

Happy viewing!",1334102400,,1035,4.359375

This is a teen comedy from 1988, starring Robert Sean Leonard and David Warner.
Jeremy Capello (Robert Sean Warner) has a date with a difference..he becomes a vampire !
But theres no carnage or brooding involved,is a sweet,funny and entertaining story,not to be taken too seriously.

193161,4,1573624802,"This is a very silly and funny movie about a High School student who becomes a vampire.

193162,5,1573624802,"I've been looking for this movie for years (it was just recently released to dvd, and I never thought to check VHS).  All in all great movie (every bit as good as I remembered from the late 80's), but this long overdue release to DVD is nothing special.  Well worth the $10 or so not much more.",1279929600,,294,4.140350877192983
193163,4,1573624802,"A Houston teen's world is turned upside-down when he discovers the woman he recently attempted to have a sexual encounter with was a vampire, and now he's one too. With the help of his vampire advisor, Modoc, Jeremy Capello learns the ins and outs of being a modern vampire, from buying pig's blood at an all-night butcher's shop to avoiding the local slayer-wannabes (in this case, the always great David Warner). It wouldn't be so difficult for Jeremy if he wasn't trying to win the heart of a certain girl at school, and if he didn't have to worry about his best friend being slain by a vampire hunter who is after the wrong guy all-together.

Ah, how to describe this gem of a film called ""My Best Friend is a Vampire"". It's a 1980's classic, if you liked the goofy supernatural comedies of the '80's. I'm a Teen Wolf fanatic myself, and I always saw this 1987 flick as the vampire answer to TW. It's no ""Fright Night"". In fact, it's not scary at all, but it's a lot of cheesy '80's fun. Very dated, but very enjoyable. But I honestly do not get Jeremy's attraction to the androgynous girl at school rather than the gorgeous cheerleader who was desperate for his bod (for some reason). After seeing the flick, I don't think it was her personality, so I really don't get it, ha. Though, it probably relates to the film's themes on subjects like sexual identity and activity, teen angst, prejudice, etc..., all that heavy '80's teen stuff. Actually, it particularly plays as a metaphor on homosexuality, though one can also simply view this as a fun vampire click if you don't want to think too hard. This movie is a great flashback fun-flick, especially if you like '80's comedies or '80's vampire flicks. Not to be confused with the early-Jim Carrey vampire comedy, ""Once Bitten"", which, frankly, I'm not sure I've ever really seen in its entirety yet. Gotta remedy that sometime. This DVD release is severely lacking, but could be a lot worse. It's fullscreen and the only bonus feature is an okay triva track. The trailer at least would have been a great inclusion. Still, I'm just glad this one made it onto DVD. There are many others I can think of that still need to get that far, or need to go back into print.",1272240000,2,2220,4.5361596009975065
193164,4,1573624802,"Hadn't seen this in years. Was surprised to find out that, if anything, I enjoyed it more now than back when it came out.

Filled with funny sight gags and a legitimate sense of breezy fun; this movie stands on it's own and isn't just recommended as a nostalgia piece. It's one of the better vampire comedies ever made (up there with ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""Love at First Bite""). Recommended above other forays into the genre; such as ""Once Bitten"".

Unfortunately, this is a no-frills release so all you get here is the movie - and it looks like it was taken from a Laserdisk (or equivalent) master. Yeah - it's definitely better than watching the VHS - but not much.",1269475200,2,680,4.520325203252033
193185,5,1573624802,"I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it - while everyone else liked that one with Jim Carey in it, which I just thought was silly, I was watching this one (and ""Rockula,"" which I hope will someday be put out in DVD format).

Jeremy and Ralph are best friends - but while Ralph apparently has no trouble asking out women, Jeremy is shy around the fairer gender, despite the fact that the beautiful cheerleader Candy has the hots for him.  But Jeremy is strangely drawn to Darla Blake - a baritone sax player in the band and not the type of girl that usually leads to the sorts of dreams that Jeremy has been having about her.

Things start to get strange when Jeremy's dream about Darla is interrupted by a strange woman.  Even weirder, the next day when out delivering groceries, Jeremy discovers this strange woman is the new delivery recipient on his grocery route.  After her cat has scratched his finger, she first licks, then sucks on his finger and invites him back to her house that night at midnight ... I'm sure you can see where this is going.  Needless to say, there is a crazed vampire killer with his bumbling assistant; a vampire ""counselor"" sent to help Jeremy adjust to his new life (played by the very talented Rene Aberjonois of ""Deep Space Nine"" fame) and, of course, a bevy of beautiful vampire women.  It is also (as far as I can tell) the very first movie in which we see a very young Kathy Bates.

If you enjoy lighter vampire fare, this is definitely the movie for you.  It is just a lot of fun, very 80s, great soundtrack.  I hope you'll give this a chance, if you weren't already aware of it.",1265587200,18,1631,4.353135313531353
193186,5,1573624802,"We all remember the 80's as a time of strange yet great times. Look no further than a classic 80's vampire comedy. See Robert Sean Leonard in his young days before House in what may be one of his best comedic roles.

An average teen in high school meets a beautiful older woman that wants to meet him in the evening. He goes for it, looking forward to a night of passion only to find himself being bitten by a vampire only moments before a crazed slayer busts onto the scene. The boy then must go through the awkward change from mortal to vampire, all while dealing with the average high school anxiety that comes with being with a boy his age. Comic gold unfolds and you get to watch a boy become a man and a vampire very quickly.

This is a must have for any lover of the 80's.",1255132800,4,779,4.152317880794702

193189,4,1573624802,"This film is a heartwarming feature that treats vampirism like Juvenile Diabetes. People who catch this communicable disease are only subject to lifestyle changes and drinking blood is to be thought of as ""Taking your vitamins"".

And it isn't a sappy teenage love story either. Moreso it delivers a quality message about the power of friendship when friends turn out, by way of their physical being or their ethical character, to be less than ideal.

Also this film turns away from most 80's films as it openly mocks the objectification of women in cinema as those that attempt such actions in this film often have the tables turned against them.

All in all, I recommend this film for anyone who would enjoy a light-hearted look at vampires instead of the gory and gruesome look given to them by modern media.",1245888000,,810,4.771428571428571

It is not necessarily the best movie I have seen or what I think is the best movie, everyone has their own opinion of what is the best. To me this is a fun twist to a movie about two teenage boys, One turning into a Vampire and the other mistaken for a vampire. The Teenage vampire being stocked by a vampire trainer and his friend is being stocked by two vampire killers. The parents of the vampire thinks he is gay, but is not and the girl he wants finally goes out on a date with him. Just a movie to kill a night at home with.",1241913600,,575,3.8403361344537816
193191,4,1573624802,"If you love 80s comedies and vampire films, definitely snag this gem finally available on DVD.  But, there are two problems.  The first is that it's still in Full Frame instead of Widescreen.  Why go through the motions of putting this great comedy out in only Full Screen?  Second, the disc cover indicates it has a 5.1 Dolby sound audio.  This is a lie.  I just checked the channels and they are not separated properly like an true 5.1 DVD.  Instead, channel one through three are all the same - music, sound effects and dialog mixed together.  If this was an actual 5.1 disc, channel one would be music only, channel two sound effects with a bit of music and the third what you hear in the film.  This situation really disappointed me since I've been trying to complete the soundtrack to this film for quite awhile now and had high hopes to get the needed songs from the 5.1 audio.  Other than these two errors, the movie is still a must have for 80s comedy and vampire fans.",1241308800,,978,4.41340782122905
193192,5,1573624802,"This is a cheesy 80's coming of age flick with a vampire shtick.

Honestly this is one of my favorite vampire movies ever because it takes vampires a completely different direction than any other movie I have ever seen.

I have been wanting to see this on DVD ever since my VHS player ate my last VHS copy, my second i wore the first one out, which was the last straw for VHS for me. I destroyed the player and sold the tapes, except for a few collectibles like Song of the South.

Anyway it is a good movie ... and actually one of my 10 year old's favorite as well as mine.",1240444800,,574,4.061946902654867

Thank You.  3/10/2009.  Deal with it you (wide screen people).Not everything looks good in widescreen remeber the longest day or the outlaw josie wales, even Charlie Chaplin's Classic (the Gold Rush)was wide screened and looked very bad.

193215,1,1573624802,"I have waited for years for this movie to come out. I love it,....but fullscreen ? Does Lionsgate seriously think that we're that dumb that we'll accept fullscreen ? Even if we don't have a widescreen tv, we can still watch widescreen movies....that is, those of us that have more than two brain cells watch widescreen and hate fullscreen. They only time that fullscreen is acceptable is if it's an old tv show or pre-50s movie when widescreen wasn't invented yet. *blows raspberry*",1235692800,6,482,4.819277108433735
193216,4,1573624802,"Despite its campiness, this film is quite enjoyable.  It is suitable as a family film for those over 13 years old.  Though it is quite dated by todays standards, I found this film a great deal of laughs.  Recommended highly for those seeking a lighthearted view of vampires!",1141948800,,274,4.666666666666667
193217,5,1573624802,"I saw this film for the first time at around 2am on some random cable network. I liked it so much, I had to buy it. I've seen it around a hundred times, and it never loses anything.

Jeremy Capello has a bit of a problem. He goes on a grocery delivery and meets a beautiful woman who invites him to come back to her house at midnight. A teenage boy with hormones all-a-rage wouldn't turn her down, that's for sure! He meets her, and she bites his neck just before a madman breaks the door down and runs him out.

The next day, he is approached by a man who claims that the woman was a vampire, and that he would soon be turning himself. Of course, Jeremy doesn't believe his new 'vampire advisor', until he starts to notice the changes himself.

This film is an 80's comedy, and is filled with great 80's music. The acting is surprisingly good, even though the film is full of no-name actors (except for one or two). Don't sit down expecting Oscar material and you might just enjoy this one. I personally can't wait until a DVD is for sale...if that ever happens.",1127606400,8,1063,4.278606965174129

Yet I find myself watching it over and over.
It is paced perfectly and never gets slow.
Overall it is a good teen comedy that does not take
vampires seriously.
If you were a teen in the 80's it is even
more funny to watch this movie.
I would wait for a dvd version.",1084492800,2,313,4.064516129032258
193220,2,1573624802,"this is an interesting story but it sorta blows out awhile in the run in. Robert Sean Leonard is a great pic as Jeremy Capello but the other supportees like his parents and Rene Auberjoinis(Star Treak DSN fame), that fat guy and David Herman(Ninja Turtles: The Secret Of The Ooze) sorta downwash his performance, but luckily his friend played by Evan Mirand(Fight Club) helps this movie along the way. Cheryl Pollack(Pump Up The Volume) also starts, and what the hell happened to her anyway, I don't see her in movies lately, that is a bummer because she is hot. good 80's music and some good atmosphere also boost it up one star. just don't find some logic in here",1067904000,2,665,4.5966386554621845
193221,5,1573624802,"The whole reason I got this was because one of my first crushes was on Robert Sean Leonard, the guy who plays Jeremy Capello in this film.  The other reason was it's fresh and comedic approach to the vampire genre in general.  Almost from the first you are laughing and, even though I am no longer a teen(30 in July) I can still remember why it was I got a crush on Robert in the first place.  The last reason I got this was because of Rene Aberjunois(sp), who plays Modok, Jeremys Vampire counsellor if you will.  Seeing him in this is what intrigued me enoght to watch him in Star Trek:DS9 later on.  A brilliant actor in a genuinly funny movie.",1047168000,,647,4.270491803278689
