4588448,5,B0056GLNPO,I have been working out to Denise for 13 years....this is my new favorite:)I only intended on doing 2 segments when i first put it in my dvd player....I did the whole dvd. It is really good!,1315872000,4,190,4.162162162162162
4588449,5,B0056GLNPO,"I tried this DVD for the first time today and I really like it. The warm up is perfect with light stretches and movement to get the body warmed up. The exercise routines are perfect for getting in quick work outs for those who are busy, and who isn't busy nowadays? Denise is supportive and encouraging. The moves are easy enough to learn, with some new stuff thrown in, but nothing that will cause serious injuries. I have been a Denise Austin fan for years, and this new DVD proves that she still has what it takes to compete with all the new videos out there.",1315785600,21,562,4.311320754716981
4588450,5,B0056GLNPO,"I did the ""Sculpt & Burn Body Blitz"" for the first time today and it did make my body break a light to medium sweat.  I was a little sore about 5 hours later.

The DVD has the warm up, the cool down, and four individual and self-contained ten minute workouts.  I did all six parts from begining to end, and I thought it was good.  You have the option of doing any one workout or all four or any combination, with or without the warm up and cool down.  It also has the option for instruction or music only.  There's also a 30 day recommendation for anyone who needs guidance on what workout to do and what days to do it on.

Here's the breakdown.

Warm up (5 minutes):  This has a few unusual moves which I have never seen before this video.  I enjoyed it.

Mixed Martial Arts (10 minutes): I found this workout and the Athletic Conditioning workout a little challenging, and for both, I had to modify some moves.  Both aerobic workouts moved your body along.

Athletic Conditioning (10 minutes):  Please see the martial arts workout for info.

Kettlebell-Inspired (10 minutes):  Don't worry.  You don't need a kettlebell for this one.  Denise Austin and the other co-exercisers use one light dumbbell.  The extra light weight boosts the calorie burn and intensity.  The movements were practically non-stop, but with only one light weight, one can do it. I liked this one.

Cardio Sculpt (10 minutes):  This one uses two light weight dumbbells.  But again, the weight is light, with the same purpose: boosting calorie burn. I liked this one too.

Cool down (5 minutes): Some stretches are a little difficult, but you do what's comfortable or what you can.

Finally, Ms. Austin has two male and two female demonstrators, so this is intended for both men and women.  Ms. Austin is chatty, instructive, and encouraging.  I recommend this video.",1315699200,102,1840,4.633540372670807
4588451,5,B0056GLNPO,"This workout is amazing!  I love this workout -- it's fun AND it's a lot harder than I expected.  The segments are short but they are really intense.  I am glad Denise gives some breaks in between b/c I was breathing pretty hard!!  I'm very advanced and this was tough for me to do. Denise really rocks in this one and as I detest doing the same stuff over and over again this video provides a lot of different moves that I had not done.  This will challenge an intermediate or advanced exerciser for sure.  And I have always loved Denise Austin -- she was the original that kept telling people to workout and get in shape and do it with a smile for ""health and vitality"".  Her attitude is so uplifting. No worries. This workout is great -- I love it!",1313884800,19,751,4.246478873239437

4588455,5,B0056GLNPO,Great for quick blasts. Each routine is about 15 minutes and each one is different. I use it for a midday burst but would be good to so whole tape at once as well,1455667200,,162,3.7941176470588234
4588456,3,B0056GLNPO,Love her workout but don't really care to have the four other people in the background. They are distracting!,1455494400,,109,4.7894736842105265
4588457,5,B0056GLNPO,"Here's another great Denise Austin workout video. There are several workouts I'm still in the process of learning, but I anticipate I will like this one as well the other 2 I have already mastered.  You get great workouts & results without the ""pain"" some other trainers put you through. My daughter who's a physical therapist gives a thumbs up to Denise Austin & her workouts.",1452643200,,377,4.712121212121212
4588458,4,B0056GLNPO,"This was a fun, challenging workout. I like that it's broken up into four 10 minute sessions, because it makes it seem like the time goes by faster. There are two 10 minute cardio workouts (one which involves kick-boxing moves that are fun and energizing. Definitely my favorite session) and two 10 minute workouts involving strength training. One if them is kettle-bell inspired, so you only use one weight to swing and chop with controlled movements. The other is interval training, which keeps your heart rate up while toning your muscles. Denise is super encouraging. I don't like it when trainers bully you into the workouts. She doesn't do that at all. She's uplifting, friendly, and motivating. Just when you want to give up, she smiles and tells you that you can do it. It's like working out with a friend everyday.",1452643200,,823,4.802816901408451
4588459,2,B0056GLNPO,Very disappointed. I have a hard time with my shoulder and knee joints from previous injuries and I didn't think these workouts would be so high impact. I wasn't able to complete the workouts as I was in danger of reinjuring myself if I did.,1449100800,,241,4.377777777777778
4588460,3,B0056GLNPO,Love Denise Austin and her motivation to exercise. So happy you had these CDs,1446508800,,77,4.571428571428571
4588461,5,B0056GLNPO,"I love Denise Austin! This video was challenging, but also fun. It really got my heart rate up and I was pretty sore the next day. I regularly work out with Denise doing combinations of cardio and strength training, and this was a perfect compliment to my collection. It was a little more challenging, but I know if I stick with it, I'll see the changes. I love Denise's bubbly personality and her workouts are just hard enough but you can walk the next day. She makes it easy to stick with. I've been working out with Denise since 2007 and own 10 videos. Love her!",1438214400,,565,4.339622641509434

4588464,5,B0056GLNPO,Denise Austin never fails to produce great workout DVD's. If you are looking for something that will work you hard but not too hard I recommend this one. After the workout you really feel like you worked hard. I usually do two workouts with warm up and cool down. She gives you four different 10 minute workouts so you don't have to worry about becoming bored. Really you are getting more for your money. A lot of people complain about her chirpy style but for me it works. Plus there is the option to workout without hearing her voice. With DVD's like this one there really is no excuse not to workout.,1429315200,,603,4.392857142857143

Who knew 10 minutes could be so beneficial.  The least expensive and most convenient way to get a workout in that fits with your schedule.  I highly recommend this. I used this DVD post-pregnancy, and it was a wonderful tool to have to fit in short workouts while my daughter was napping. No excuses; you can do it! Feel awesome and look great! Be healthy!",1412985600,,517,4.468085106382978
4588477,5,B0056GLNPO,"I have worked out with Denise Austin for years now, but this dvd has been different then the rest. It was quite challenging at first but I stuck with it. After 2 weeks, I could see results in my muscle strength and I was more toned. This dvd includes 4 different workouts (plus a warm up and cool down) and you can mix and match them. It has now been 3 months with this as my regular workout dvd. I am still seeing results even with only doing two of the four sets. This workout is high intensity so you will SWEAT! If you want low impact, then go with a different Denise dvd. And I happen to like Denise's voice: encouraging and it doesnt feel like she is yelling at you :)",1412294400,3,674,4.075187969924812

Often I feel like Denise is just making it up as she goes along.  I got about halfway through and just couldn't handle it anymore.  On the plus side, WAS sweating!",1408406400,3,333,4.076923076923077

4588490,4,B0056GLNPO,"Good workout.  Works various muscles, parts of the body, and decent cardio.  Moves a little fast, though.  She doesn't always explain/demonstrate before you need to be in the move already and then it's practically over.  Took me about 3 times before I was moving along with her.  But it's a good sweat!",1404000000,2,302,4.730769230769231
4588491,5,B0056GLNPO,"This is a great workout. I watched it first and thought ""easy peesy"".  How wrong was I? I like that you build yourself up to do all the routines over the course of a month. Make sure you have good sneakers because there is a lot of bouncing/jumping.",1403222400,,249,4.1875

4588493,2,B0056GLNPO,Everyone has their own workout style and preferences.  I don't connect with her style of teaching. She's very mild and soft spoken.  I'm more of a Jillian Michaels follower.  I tried only 10 minutes of this video before I stopped and changed videos to another Jillian Michaels work out.  I just couldn't get into it.,1402876800,,316,4.6909090909090905

It is broke up into 10 minute segments so you can chose your workout depending on the time you have available.  Like one reviewer mentioned each 10 min segment works the whole body not just certain areas (arms, or abs etc) and you have the choice to workout with or without weights.

4588499,5,B0056GLNPO,"I loved this workout!  Really varied, good core workout, cardio too!  Not for beginners.  Since you are moving the weights about you need to know how to control them and keep your form correct.  But if you are experienced it is no problem.",1400803200,,239,4.488372093023256

4588503,5,B0056GLNPO,"This is a mix of intense intervals, some boxing and athletic moves and sculpting.  There are four 10-minute workouts fairly diverse in character with a 5 minute warm-up and cool down.

The four 10-minute workouts are as follows:

Kick boxing moves
Athletic moves - fairly non-stop moving and some more complex moves (found this very challenging)
Sculpting with one body weight - kettle weight moves ( like this one)
Cardio sculpt workout with two weights - squats, overhead presses, lunges, bicep curls, overhead presses etc. (like this one)

If you have 10 minute spots of time  to exercise during the day, this is a great video.  Or you can do it all at once if you want a strenuous workout.  This seems like a good workout for upper and lower body.  I like the variety. Love that this is free to stream through Amazon's prime program. 4.5 stars",1397001600,2,847,4.675675675675675

4588506,5,B0056GLNPO,"I would consider myself an intermediate level exerciser.  I have found this work out to be challenging, but not so much that I avoid it.  I look forward to doing this knowing I'll work up a sweat and feel great afterward.
Being in my forties, there are some videos out there that are just too challenging for my joints.  I end up with my knees hurting so bad after that I can't work out as well the next day.  I don't get that from this.
I do the whole program from start to finish.
Here is the breakdown:
5 minutes warm up.  Nice dynamic stretching with easy aerobic movement.
10 minutes kick boxing style workout.  Lots of kicks and punches, really gets your body moving.
10 minutes athletic style work out (this one is the toughest in my opinion.)
10 minutes kettle bell style using a dumbell
10 minutes with two dumbells, some aerobic, lots of toning
5 minutes cool down, lots of nice stretching.

I like Austin's style, she is nice and encouraging, not a drill sergeant.  She's a little hard to keep up with the first time, but when you know what's coming next it's easy to follow and the work out really flows.",1394236800,,1116,4.383495145631068

I enjoy the ability to customize the workouts to fit my schedule and energy level. When attempting to gain a energy surge this DVD will do the trick.

Almost like she was making the moves up as she went, it didn't feel choreographed like the others.  A lot of ""bebopping"" around like what a kid would do. I almost felt silly doing the video.  Was greatly disappointed and another reviewer was right in say some of the moves were to quick and dangerous for your joints ie: knees.  May sell it used not sure yet.  I recommend Jullian Michaels Yoga inferno was the complete controlled work out that let you feel like you got the right amount of intense work out.",1389657600,2,608,4.392857142857143

It has six parts .First 5 minutes are warm-up, and then the next four parts have 10 minutes each . All of them are easy to follow . The last sixth part is a 5 minutes of cool down. Total running time is 52 minutes. Time goes very fast. I love this dvd . you get good exercise and makes you swet like anything. I feel soooo good when I finished this workout. I strongly recommend to everyone particularly those who wants to lose weight .Most of the movements are not very hard at all.

4588526,1,B0056GLNPO,"Every once in a while I forget why I dislike Denise Austin's videos and decide to give her another go.  And then it all comes rushing back to me... this video fails for the same reasons all of her other videos fail - Denise is a crappy instructor.

This is more of a rant than a review:

My main issue with her style is that she doesn't actually instruct.  Her verbal cues are few and far between, and on the rare occasions she does remind you to protect your knees or back you're already halfway through a set and she doesn't actually tell you HOW to protect your body.  Instead of providing practical instruction on knee placement she says things like, ""Think of your arms and legs! We're reshaping our bodies!""  (Thanks for that info, Denise.  I'm actually not reshaping my body because I'm spending more time trying to figure out what you're doing than actually exercising...)  As an aside, she also mentions this is a ""low impact"" workout but you're constantly bouncing around and doing squats and lunges with handweights, and there's a short portion of the video based on a kettlebell workout for which she also provides absolutely zero technical instruction.  In my opinion, this is not just poor instruction, but actually makes her workouts dangerous for beginners who do not know how to properly protect themselves from injury.

My other issue with her lack of instruction is the same issue the crew in the video seems to have - she doesn't tell you when she's moving on.  They, and you, spend a good deal of time trying to catch up with her after she's transitioned into a different set without warning.  Maybe if you did this workout often enough to memorize the routines it wouldn't be a problem, but as someone who works out 5+ times a week, I can tell you that no one serious about fitness is going to incorporate this video enough to get there.

All of this leaves me wondering who this workout is for.  It's not safe for beginners and it's not intense enough for people with enough experience to perform it without injuring themselves.  Complete waste of time.",1385424000,10,2076,4.618528610354224

My muscles just weren't ready for all of the video, but I like that because it gives me something to work towards.

There are two cardio, two weight-bearing sessions that are easy to keep up with. I feel I've had a good workout without exhausting myself, Afterwards I have energy to take on the day. What I don't need: When rising from the floor on your feet during one drill, Denise repeatedly says, ""Let me see that smiling face!""

They are more challenging than her other dvds that I have and I love this one. Definitely seeing results on the scale and with the way I feel. I really like her personality and always have.

There are 4 10 minute workouts, very intense, and I looked forward to the 9 minute mark when it would be over. But I felt I had really accomplished something when I was done. I really love the separate 5 minute warm-up and cool-down. I actually use them with other videos because I enjoy them so much. The cool-down uses some yoga moves and stretches which are very helpful. The mixed Martial Arts video was the hardest one for me because of the the many versions of jumping jacks. I like to do one for about 5 times in a row so I can feel I have mastered it, then move on to the next one.  The Kettlebell-inspired 10 minute video actually uses weights. I have priced kettlebells and prefer weights instead. the cardio sculpt is a strength training move and is an extra-good workout; you also end up on your back for the last 2 minutes or so which is a nice little rest.",1378857600,,1056,4.28

4588539,3,B0056GLNPO,"There were a number of things about this DVD that disappointed me.  First, there's no way to just set each segment to run without interruption.  So every time a segment ended, I have to grab the remote, tell it where to go next, and also tell it whether I want to listen to Denise's running commentary or not before I can go on.  This is annoying.  Second, there are no modifications to the routines.  Sure, Denise briefly mentions maybe one or two that can be done, but nothing is really demonstrated for any of these exercises - no instruction on good form, nobody shows an alternative to the movements.  I don't like this DVD, but I gave it three stars anyway.",1372204800,3,663,4.43801652892562

Denise has much better workouts - like her Boot Camp Total Body and her 3 Week Boot Camp.  The moves seem disjointed and there are not enough reps in the cardio segments.  In the weight segments there is entirely too much swinging involved. In fact, having done this video 6 times, I can honestly say that it is the only Denise Austin DVD that gives me a severe neck ache after each use...not a good sign.",1357430400,2,521,4.285714285714286

My favorite aspect about this DVD is that she has male instructors with her. And there is this one she calls ""Jerry"" who is really fun. Yeah, it is the small things that I guess I like, but it is better that she has a mix of women and men instructors I think.

That's a real goal, and a darn good one.

I used this video daily for about 2 1/2 months and I noticed an increasing amount of pain while doing the overhead lifts in the kettlebell segment.

So for the first time I did the Warm Up (5 min.), Mixed Martial Arts (10 min), Cardio Sculpt (10 min.) and Cool Down (5 min.)  I wanted something different then just my normal M-W-F weight workout.

The difficulty can be changed up by upping the weight on the hand weights that you use with these workouts. The mixed martial arts and athletic conditioning are a little more challenging, so I have not done them as often (am working up to including them more regularly). I am also a little challenged in the coordination department, so I have had to take the moves slower than Denise does in the workouts at first, but I have been able to get them down.

I wear a heart rate monitor when I workout, and I find that this does get my heart rate up for a great cardio workout!

I would say this would be good for someone who has had some other workout video experience, as she doesn't spend time on exercise form since the segments are only 10 minutes.

8459604,5,B0056GLNPO,A great work out. However the huge steroid guy and Denise's over done hair and makeup was very distracting indeed.,1466726400,,114,4.75
8459605,5,B0056GLNPO,One of best workout videos for results and flexibility of time.,1466640000,,63,4.818181818181818
