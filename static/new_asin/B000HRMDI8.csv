2640237,5,B000HRMDI8,"Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime.  American Taxpayers are directly paying for ""cheap labor"" in a thousand ways every day, many examples are illustrated in this important film.  The solution is to wake-up the ""silent majority"" of Americans so that they will be motivated to vote the right people into office to address this crisis.  Begin by educating people by having multiple screenings, before the new world order takes hold in your back yard.",1160524800,41,458,5.08
2640238,1,B000HRMDI8,"This DVD is terrbily narrowminded and fails to give an accurate reresentation of many of the truths behind illegal immigration. They take the popular point of view, that view being that illegals are ruining the country and they are all criminals etc. Folks, there is a lot more to it than that and there is another story that is not shown here. If you want to see a good documentary on illegals watch ""Crossing Arizona"" (not the Farley Bros. movie).",1208908800,11,449,4.625
2640239,5,B000HRMDI8,"Today's illegal aliens are often angry at the United States.  They feel entitled to our goods and services.  We owe it to them. After all, they believe we initially ripped off these items from their own country.  This is especially true of countless Mexican illegals.  Americans are supposedly disgusting imperialists.  The makers of the Border War documentary go to great lengths to provide ample time for the participants to express their views.  And this is even true concerning one gentleman who is ardently pro-illegal alien.  He was treated quite fairly.

Border War clearly shows the ecological damage caused by these illegals.  Crime has risen in the areas of Arizona most impacted by the crisis.  Sometimes police officers are murdered. Hospitals have had to close due to the nonpayment of their services.  Both Republican and Democratic politicians, however, usually could care less.  Major GOP donors see the illegals as providers of cheap labor and Democrats see them as eventual voters.  The longer term harm to the United States is ignored merely to satisfy some people's selfish short term goals.  Is the film dated?  Should the fact that it was made a few years ago deter you?  Nope, not in the least.  Border War serves as a splendid introduction.  It should significantly add to your understanding of this serious threat to our national unity and financial stability.

2640240,5,B000HRMDI8,We bought this video because my daughter was preparing a speech on illegal immigration. It was full of useful information that helped add quality to her speech. I learned a lot when I watched it! I would recommend this to anyone that wants information on illegal immigration.,1202428800,8,275,4.872340425531915

2640242,5,B000HRMDI8,"Outstanding clarification of the problem--how it came to be--and why we must solve it!  It defines the sabotage involved, and illustrates the detrimental impact on infrastructure and the fabric of American life in general.  The lives lost (and taken) in this ""informal war"" (reminds me of the Korean War) are just so unnecessary, and should never have happened!  The foment is artificial, and of a very disruptive nature (as in deliberate).  The definition of an outlaw is one who violates one law after another, with no concern for the cumulative effect.  This DVD illustrates the current,  salient, and active endorsement by some factions of pure lawlessness.  This is also part of the definition of anarchy, the complement of chaos!",1194566400,13,735,5.126050420168068
2640243,4,B000HRMDI8,"Very good movie for those of us who think something NEEDS TO BE DONE to SECURE our border! I would STRONGLY suggest that this movie be seen by every American, and every Mexican as well! DEFINATELY worth purchasing! A real GOOD BUY!

2640244,2,B000HRMDI8,"Be aware that this is NOT a balanced look at illegal immigration. I watched this movie hoping to see and hear both sides of the issue: to see not only how it affects those who want our borders strengthened, but also to see how the illegal-immigrants themselves are affected and what drives people from both sides. I ended up more upset at its blantant slant and subtle fear-mongering, than anything. The film is produced by a staunchly conservative group, which speaks volumes of the obvious slant.

Regardless of what your stance on illegal immigration is, this film is heavily biased and has an agenda, yet tries to paint itself as a ""balanced"" look at the lives of people involved in the hot-button issue of illegal-immigration. I've read that the lack of a narrator allows for these people to tell their own stories, thereby removing any judgment, but you come away from this film thinking that a large portion of these illegal immigrants are violent criminals, murderers and child molesters. One of the stories nearly translates completely as ""If illegal-immigrants were not here, I would not have been molested as a child."" While this part of her story is very tragic, it really has nothing to do with the illegal immigration debate and it really seems like it was tossed in to scare us.

Sadly, a few editing choices and one or two more people from the other side would have made this a much better documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed the border patrol portions of this documentary as well as the portions with the congressman, but overall I feel this was not balanced whatsoever, and it should not present itself as such.",1171152000,22,1627,4.786476868327402
2640245,5,B000HRMDI8,"This DVD is balanced look at our immigration policy.  It shows why we must stop ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS from coming to this country.  It shows the effects of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION by showing us there stories.  Especially the story of the woman and how her father helped ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS get into this country.  This DVD shows that if a person can come to America ILLEGALLY to look for a better way of life than a member of Al-Qaeda or Hamas can come here ILLEGALLY with a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb wanting to kill Americans.

This DVD is not anti Immigrant in fact one of the border agents is an Mexican American immigrant, as well as others who want to stop ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  This is a DVD I strongly recommend.",1168560000,18,713,4.53125
2640246,5,B000HRMDI8,A stunning look at reality the media won't tell you about. Every American should see this film!,1168473600,15,95,4.647058823529412
2640247,5,B000HRMDI8,"I gave this film five stars, not for cinematoghaphy, acting etc....but for the content. This film is a documentary that all Americans who have yet to get involved in the illegal immigrant debate should see. For those Americans, this will be an eye opener that will make your insides boil and realize the ineptitude of our government officials who refuse to address this issue head-on and do whats best for America.

There is nothing phony in this film, it places you in the real world of what actually is going on. It could be viewed as a compilation of all the news clips one sees on the news, that is to say, cable news, as the network news refuse to show us the real experience.

There are interviews with people on both sides of the issue. You will see and hear average Americans who daily confront this issue while being harrassed by the pro-illegal immigrant pundits, columnists, the liberal press, as well as our own president. You will see the vulgar anger and arrogance of the illegals themselves and their supporters on this side of the border. All this, while America sleeps.

The film will give you insight of what is in store for America if illegal immigrants get amnesty and later citizenship. Once these 12 to 20 million illegals get amnesty, we can't send them back, they will belong to us and we will have to pay for them.

Now that the Democrats control the House and the Senate, Bush's bill to grant illegal immigrants amnesty will surely pass. It will be to late for us by then. I urge all Americans to view this film and get involved somehow. If you can't go to the border with the Minutemen or to rallys, we have the internet to contact our politicians with your letters, or you can call thir offices.

I believe that once you view this film, you will wonder why the network news media has not alerted you. You will also wonder why you haven't been involved.

If we don't resolve this issue correctly, our children and grandchildren will have a different America awaiting them.

The beginning then, is to buy, rent or borrow this documentary and start to fight back. Right now, the illegals and their supporters are doing all the talking and Washington is listening to them. Why are we asleep. Our rich politicians, who live in gated communities, will never have to worry about the impact in their communities. It is us, the average Americans who will bear the brunt of change to our communities.

I highly recommend this film. When you view it, ask yourself which side you stand, then act, before its too late.",1163030400,25,2533,4.588495575221239

8140913,5,B000HRMDI8,"This is a very well-done video showing the problems resulting from the federal government's negligence in not securing the southern border. Even though this video was released in 2006, it is very timely since the problem has only continued to get worse under the last and current administration. In fact, the Bush and Obama administrations have not only failed big time in providing the necessary security on our border with Mexico, but have through their misguided policies actually encouraged the violations of our immigration laws and the resulting lawlessness along the border which has intruded into our nation with countless thousands of US citizens dying at the hands of illegal alien criminals and gangs. As far as the current crisis goes, only 20% are children. The other 80% are adults, many of them multiple deportees. One such alien which had been deported more than once murdered Deputy David William March and then fled back into Mexico which refused to extradite him for fear he would suffer the justice he deserved for his ruthless and cold-blooded murder of Deputy March. It wasn't until many years later that he was brought back to the US for trial after promises that he would not get the death penalty. It makes no sense at all to deploy our troops all over the world while leaving our borders wide open to penetration by not only criminal gangs, but terrorists and foreign nationals who do not have our best interests at heart, but rather mean to exploit this failure in our national security policy. It's time for Americans to wake up! Our nation is not secure when our troops are dying in foreign wars and our people and law enforcement are dying at the hands of these illegal alien criminal invaders!!!",1407283200,,1726,4.854237288135593

There are two sides to every story and this documentary touches on both, concerning the Mexican immigrant that wants nothing more than to live and work in America. And the ugly side of armed drug lords and gang members infiltrating our borders on a daily basis and their inner workings.

The fact that our Federal Govt. have recently denied both Governors of Arizona and Texas a specific request for National Guard back-up along the borders makes this documentary a MUST SEE for every American citizen concerned about the direction of the Political machine in D.C.",1241913600,2,693,5.0701754385964914
