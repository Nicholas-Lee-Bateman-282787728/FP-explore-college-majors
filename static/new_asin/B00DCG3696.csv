5789021,5,B00DCG3696,"it was so different from most of the hallmark movies I have watched. I enjoy mysteries, fun and love , so it was  all three.hope hallmark has more of these in the making!!",1393804800,10,171,4.181818181818182
5789022,1,B00DCG3696,"Warning!!!

I wear hearing aids and need close-captioning to be able to watch most movies.

This movie is advertised on Amazon as closed-captioned. The information of the back of the movie case shows the ""CC"" (closed-captioned) symbol, but it not closed-captioned. There is no menu item to select it and it doesn't play automatically. I feel this is false advertising by Gaiam/Vivendi.",1393113600,4,385,5.193548387096774
5789023,4,B00DCG3696,"The movie when advertised on television made you think that Gregory Harrison was an integral part of the film. Alas, his role was more like a cameo but it was still enjoyable despite the fact that it was a ""murder"" who done it romantic comedy. How is that for a plot twist?  Easily predictable but again still enjoyable.  Loved the cast of characters.",1391904000,5,351,4.555555555555555
5789024,5,B00DCG3696,"This movie has mild suspense, but it is also a bit romantic, offering assistance even in the darkest times.
As unlikely as it might be that an old boyfriend offers real help, it is nice to hope that it could happen.",1390780800,5,215,4.2682926829268295
5789025,5,B00DCG3696,"I don't see Hallmark on TV, and picked this because I like Wendy Malick.  It was a fun, entertaining show for when you are in the mood for something lighter.",1390780800,,157,4.233333333333333
5789026,5,B00DCG3696,"I get tired of seeing movies that are all violent and horrible language and sexual, sometimes I just want to watch a movie that feels good to watch.  This is one such movie.  Is it the best movie I've ever seen...no....but I love Wendy Malick and she's her same adorable self in this movie.  It did keep me guessing who the murderer was but then again I could have been dumb that night, in just enjoying a non-violent easy going movie and not having to concentrate too much on anything.",1389312000,19,486,4.377777777777778
5789027,3,B00DCG3696,"The movie was highly predictable and missing the wittiness that I was hoping for.  However, it was true to its description.  It was ok, just not as great as I was hoping for.  Corny, happy, feel good movie with a mostly family friendly platform (well besides a little murder and such).

Pros:
fairly family friendly
happy movie

Cons:
predictable
ok writing",1383350400,11,357,4.786885245901639

5789029,5,B00DCG3696,I really enjoy this movie...  It's very fun.... Winters are long here and movies that you describe as 'delightful' are much needed.  This is a good one!!! Way fun!!!,1379808000,22,165,4.655172413793103

5789041,5,B00DCG3696,"I love Wendy so when by chance I saw this title I didn't doubt.
Ok, as you may expect in this type of movies ( light comedy/romance) the story have many flaws, but who cares?
This is just one of those movies to watch alone or with good friends just to have a good time.",1506124800,,269,3.909090909090909
5789042,5,B00DCG3696,"Feel like having a chuckle?  Well, this movie will do it - many smiles.  It is a sort of tongue in cheek detective story, and really rather good.

5789049,3,B00DCG3696,I had no idea what this was going to be like when I ordered it but I was pleasantly surprised.  It had its share of humor and a bit of a mystery to clear up if the heroine wanted to keep herself out of jail.  I will definitely be watching it again.  A nice way to pass a couple of hours when there's nothing on television to watch.,1489190400,,331,3.838235294117647

5789088,1,B00DCG3696,"The acting is fine and I enjoyed seeing three ""older"" women as the lead and her two friends. They were both very believable. I thought the story was interesting enough. The reason for the one-star is because Wendy Malick's character asks for help from an old boyfriend who reluctantly agrees and in the process they renew their relationship. He leaves his bad marriage for her! But the catalyst of the whole movie is Wendy Malick's husband leaving HER, which grieves her terribly.  Not fond of movies which portray abandonment, divorce and adultery as acceptable.",1475366400,10,563,4.98936170212766

8591825,5,B00DCG3696,"This is embarrassing! This is a great and fun movie! Even if we discovered it on the Hallmark channel.

We moved from the San Francisco Bay Area where KQED broadcasts great mystery movies and series so often that there was always something fun to watch. Now we live in Greater Cleveland. PBS here isn't quite as in love with mysteries as the Bay Area. So we've resorted to Hallmark Movies and Mysteries, focusing on the mystery movie series. A couple of the series are entertaining and the remainder are, well, not for us.

Then one night we caught the last 70 minutes of this movie and found ourselves laughing and comparing it to such fun movies as Gene Wilder's ""Hanky Panky"" or Woody Allen's ""Manhattan Murder Mystery."" So I bought a copy of ""After All These Years"" because (1) we had missed basically the first hour, (2) Hallmark had first broadcast this movie in 2015 so a series or followup is not forthcoming, (3) Susan Isaacs had written the script, (4) I enjoy Wendy Malick in just about everything she does, and (5) this dvd was cheap cheap cheap. Now we've watched it all the way through and expect to watch it again sometime this year because we watched the last 70 minutes--remember, a repeat for us--and continued to enjoy the whole thing.

This is a cleverly written and acted film that deserves more attention than it has previously received. Oh, Susan Isaacs or Hallmark, give us more!",1521158400,2,1403,4.649193548387097

This is a really good mystery and I was guessing who murdered the husband even to the end. A movie full of Hallmark greats.
This is a story of a woman who after 30 years together loses her husband to another woman. Just when she is facing the reality of divorce, she finds her husband on her kitchen floor with a knife to his chest. Naturally she is accused of murder. She goes on the lamb before his funeral to find out who killed him knowing all eyes are on her and the investigation will stop there. The true funny, zany adventure starts there. many twists and turns throughout. I take murder and death very serious. I know many people enjoy these stories though. Of course the victim was made out to be a very vile man. I do think this movie was well made though. Gregory Harrison is adorable here. Enjoy!!",1519171200,,956,4.376404494382022
