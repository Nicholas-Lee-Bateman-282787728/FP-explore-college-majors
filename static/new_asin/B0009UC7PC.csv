I laugh, my husband laughs, my teenager laughs.

Very creative and energetic show.

2321955,5,B0009UC7PC,"You can get the entire Lazytown on iTunes under television shows. It's for sale as volume one and two, so you have to buy them grouped. It's a great deal when you see how many episodes are in the two volumes, basically the entire collection for about [...] bucks. The nicest part about iTunes is once you buy it there, it's on your account forever, even if you lose it. You never have to worry about another scratched dvd or hard drive crash, yours forever :D
I think it's great to get the dvds if you don't like iTunes.

The lazytown dot com website sells the physical dvds new but in PAL format (England)

I noticed some idiots selling these dvds for insane prices, don't let it get you down. New dvds can still be purchased, just no longer in the US. The iTunes versions are about 300+ mb per episode. You can always use an external hard drive or one 8Gb thumb drive will hold volume one, about 15Gb for both volumes.

You could download volume one to an 8Gb iPod or iPhone or iPad, or just download to an 8Gb flash drive. Be sure and format your flash drive in Fat32 so it works on your HDTV Usb port. Crazy hunh?, you can have the entire lazytown collection on a flash drive the size of your finger and your kids can't scratch it. If you're really cool you can connect your HDTV via Wifi and stream lazytown from your reclining easy chair from a router hub with Wifi. Have your kids grab you a Coke from the fridge and wah lah , you are lazily watching lazytown drinking and eating sweets. Be sure and make the kids eat fruits and vegetables so they stay healthy.",1278633600,3,1568,4.2727272727272725

2321960,4,B0009UC7PC,"Lazytown, takes a high action crack at Children and healthy lifestyle, and makes a new market in educational children's media! Finally a show that's tackling the issues!
Lazytown, is a children's television show adapted from a successful play from Iceland. Icelandic gymnast and role model Magns Scheving, conceived Lazytown as an effort to combat obesity, and inactivity in kids. The show has been globally sucessful; in the Uniyed States it has landed primary slots on Nickelodeon channels, and CBS Saturday morning programming. The themes of the show are very positive and attractive to children. The shows target audience age is 4-7.
The plot involves main character Stephanie visiting her uncle in Lazytown. Upon arrived she displeased with laziness and negativity of the town and tries to encourage change. Stephanie is a very attractive character for young girls. She promotes gender stereotypes with her pink hair and matching feminie accessories. She also has many singing breaks, and dance modeled like a pop star music video. Her dance moves resemble aerobics and often start to involve the whole town in exercise fashion.  The superhero of Lazytown, is Sportacus (played by Magns Scheving). He immediately agrees with Stephanie about making a change. Sportacus is naturally the admirable character for boys. He wears a blue jumpsuit, and is excellent in every sport. He uses gymnastics to get from place to place. The antagonist is Robbie Rotten, who employs all the schema of cartoon villany, right down to the evil laugh. Robbie uses temptation to align the townpeople to his side of laziness, selfishness, junkfood, and trouble. The townspeople are of diverse gender and ethnicity. Each have their vices, which make up most of their personality. The ones with most appearances are Stingy (selfish), Ziggy (candy), Trixie (mischeif), Pixel (Video Games). Through misadventures all the townspeople overcome Robbie Rotten's temptation and learn moderation and healthy lifestyle tips from Stephanie and Sportacus. Parents can use the townspeople and their lessons in moderation as an example for their own children. I witness my own cousin turn off video games saying he played too long, and referenced a plot from the show.
The only live action characters in the show are Stephanie, Sportacus, and Robbie Rotten, which give them grave importance in a show with CGI background and puppet supporting characters. The show uses lighiting fast jump cuts, and speed up motion speeds, sublimnally expressing high activity. The shows techno music and bright colors, seemingly raises pulses in kids. Watching this program with my younger cousins, it wasn't long before they were jumping along with the program. The uses of editing to evoke this reaction helps with the overall goal of the program. The catchy pop songs in every show usually have lyrics that push the shows moral.
 There isn't any commercialism in the show, which is a breath of fresh-air. The only thing show seems to endorse is ""Sport Candy"", which is just fruits and vegetables. The continue use of the ""Sport Candy"" phrases makes me think that they could use it to appear on a brand of fruit and vegetables, however there is no blantant brand marketing. For a show, with a classic good vs. evil theme, there is no violence whatsoever. Robbie Rotten is usually defeated after losing in some physical game or activity. He often gets tired and retreats home. I enjoyed the lack of pain, and humilation in the show. The viewer still understand the Good has conquered evil without anyone getting hurt emotionally or physically. The cicrumstances are usually realistic, with common consequences. However, Sportacus numerous acrobatics don't frequently come with a ""Im a professional, don't try this at home"" disclaimer.
I enjoyed my viewing of Lazytown, and find the use of plot, characters, and setting a lot more effective in encourage activity, than the surrealism of Boohbah. I think as long as Lazytown, stays true to mission, and doesn't surrender to branding and heavy merchandising, it will do a lot of good.  I commend Magns Scheving for his endeavors. The show is needed, as physical education slowly declines in schools.",1196553600,2,4198,5.179675994108984

i have downloaded the songs 4 my nieces n nephews n must admit i do listen to them myself.

2322013,3,B0009UC7PC,My son is 2 and loves Lazy Town.  I find Robbie Rotten and his antics to be a bit on the scary side at times.  The costumes that he dresses are definitely scary - especially the dinosaur costume.  But my son loves to watch this program and it doesn't seem to affect him in any way.,1142985600,3,281,3.982142857142857
2322014,5,B0009UC7PC,"Need I say more. He is a great actor. I used to watch this show with my 4 year old cousin (I am 23) and I hated it. The more I watch it the better it gets. I haven't seen this actual DVD but if these episodes are as good as the ones on TV then this is a must have DVD for kids & adults who like cartoons. Now, I personally love cartoons my Grandmother will ask me which cartoon is this (which ever one is on at the time). I am thinking of buying this DVD for my cousin & me!!",1139011200,,475,3.621359223300971
2322015,1,B0009UC7PC,"Ok......when I first saw Lazy Town I thought that it was one of the dumbest shows ever. And this DVD proves it. The story is that Sporticus is taking a break as being a super hero, and the bezarre pink-haired Stephine becomes ""Sporti-stephine"". Ah, that neame kills me. I hate Lazy Town and always will. The songs and dances are corney. The characters are corney, and the acting is corney.",1137283200,2,389,4.571428571428571
2322016,4,B0009UC7PC,"""LazyTown"" is a show marrying live-action and animation, a fairly recent port to the United States from Iceland. It's part of the new breed of children's animated programs these days --- programming especially focused on making viewers ""get up and go"" and as far as this goes, it's at the top of its game.

""LazyTown"" features a human girl, Stephanie, a human hero, Sportacus and his human nemesis, Robbie Rotten. The rest of the characters are CGI animated and quite well too. The setup is this --- generally in each episode, Sportacus (advocate of getting up and going) battles the plots and schemes of Robbie Rotten (trying and endlessly failing to make those in LazyTown lazy, also a master of disguise.) He just can't stand all the activity in LazyTown, but usually ends up expending a lot of energy himself trying to stop it. The simple fact is, no one's lazy in LazyTown anymore, largely thanks to Stephanie, an energetic girl with bubble-gum pink hair. She's still fairly new in town and living with her Uncle, Mayor Meanswell. Her group of friends is Ziggy, Pixel, Trixie and Stingy.

""LazyTown"" is loaded with high energy, fun songs. The opening theme and ""funny words"" songs can be heard in every episode and there's also at least one other new song in each one.

This DVD features three episodes of the show, including a special double-length episode --- ""LazyTown's New Superhero."" This one plays around with the format a bit, as the kids decide to give Sportacus a vacation. While Sportacus struggles to relax and take it easy, Stephanie does her best to become the new town superhero. Also included in this DVD are ""Cry Dinosaur,"" in which Robbie Rotten dresses up as a dinosaur to scare ""Sporta-Crybaby"" and ""Dr. Rottenstein,"" in which he tricks the kids into believing they have spotty vegetitis and must swear off vegetables and eat nothing but junk food. Not only that, but under the guise of Rottenstein, he bans Sportacus from LazyTown ""forever,"" another one of his old tricks.

In case you're wondering why I gave this four stars instead of five, it's because of the special features. I truly believe that DVD releases these days must have great special features in order to receive a five-star rating. Unfortunately, this DVD just doesn't measure up. All you get are written character profiles that you can browse through, a couple of pages of ""Nicktrition"" tips and some short previews for Dora and Blue's Room DVD releases as well as ""My Little Pony: A Very Minty Christmas."" These are okay, there's definitely nothing wrong with them, but it only takes about five minutes to go through at most. It couldn't have hurt to put at least a bit more effort into some nice special features.",1133740800,19,2709,4.8068669527897
2322017,5,B0009UC7PC,"Well I didn't think it was possible but I believe Sportacus has replaced Dora on the top of my 23 month old daughter's favorites list.

She has to watch this DVD at least once a day.  I really enjoy this program too since it promotes healthy habits and has very charming characters.

It helps that Magnus Scheving is easy on the eyes too!

I highly recommend this DVD.",1130889600,8,368,4.367647058823529
2322018,5,B0009UC7PC,"I got this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old and not only does she love it, but she's even learning the songs, which are a bit catchy. One thing that I really like though is that I don't mind watching it either. I'm rather tired of watching cartoons about girls catching stars. This show is entertaining and actually teaches kids that exercise and good eating habits can be fun. In a time where kids are being bombarded with shows that want you to buy their trading cards, Lazytown is a much needed change in pace. So go watch Lazytown, and than take your kids outside to play and be like Sportacus and Stephanie. Sheesh, even Robbie Rotten is great. Just don't blame me if you catch yourself humming a lazytown song at work.",1129248000,,717,4.358208955223881
2322019,5,B0009UC7PC,"One day, as she was watching Lazytown, my 4 year old, ran in the kitchen to grab a bag of mini carrots.  She proceeded to eat them as a result of the ""healthy eating"" lesson from Lazytown.

In addition, she is always active (cartwheels, jumping, etc.) during Lazytown.  For Halloween, she wants to be beautiful pink-haired Stephanie.

She can't wait for the Santa DVD that's coming out October 11th, 2005!!  I strongly recommend this DVD.",1128384000,7,438,4.786666666666667
2322020,5,B0009UC7PC,"My four year old twins loved Lazytown on Noggin and were excited to find out that there was a DVD.  Stephanie and Sporticus teach children about friendship, physical fitness, and how to eat right.  The ""villian"", Robbie Rotten, is just silly enough not to be scary, and the girls laugh each time his evil plans are foiled by the people and heroes of Lazytown.  It's a fun watch with great lessons.  Now my girls ASK what vegetables I'll be serving for dinner and remind me that sugar will not make them grow up big and strong!  Priceless!",1127520000,4,538,4.505154639175258
2322021,5,B0009UC7PC,"For those not familiar with the popular kid's show, Lazytown is a place where the citizens preferred not to do any kind of strenuous activity until the arrival of Stephanie, an energetic young girl with bright pink hair, and Sportacus, the super fit, super strong, weirdly mustached superhero who lives in a sort of blimp-like airship.

Soon Stephanie and Sportacus have the residents on the right track to good health, exercise, and fruit and vegetable consumption, punctuated by upbeat pep rally type songs and spine bending dance steps.

This does not meet the approval of the town bad guy, Robbie Rotten, who spends his days plotting the undoing of Sportacus, with various ingenious and despicable schemes.

Previously only viewable on television, this DVD allows kids to watch favorite episodes over and over again, and introduces a double-length episode where Sportacus is given a forced vacation while Stephanie takes on the Superhero role.  There are two previously aired episodes on the DVD - one where Robbie dons a dinosaur disguise to scare Sportacus, and one where he disguises himself as a doctor and makes them stop eating vegetables.

With a combination of real actors and puppets, this is a very positive family oriented show, advocating good living habits, mixed with song, dance and humor.  Highly recommended for anyone with kids between 2 and 6 years old, even though many adults may find it a little cheesy.
