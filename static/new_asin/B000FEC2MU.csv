There were not many items out there when I began looking for DVDs, and this was featured (three or so years ago). This was a waste of money. It is not kid-friendly and doesn't even teach Chinese. Look for something else. This is as good as no DVD at all.",1298332800,,321,4.193548387096774
8121380,1,B000FEC2MU,"Okay, I did not buy this product.  Nor will I.  There has to be something wrong with the title of this video.  If they mean little sister, then I think the correct pinyin form of it should be mei mei.  Mimi means breast in Chinese.  Are all the reviewers of this English only speakers, or has someone who actually speaks Chinese seen this video?  I'm just curious if their pinyin is incorrect, then will their pronunciation of words be incorrect as well?",1208649600,,454,4.475609756097561
8121381,1,B000FEC2MU,"These other reviewers are kidding you.

There are significant problems with this dvd.

1. The audio on this dvd is horrible.  It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube.  I could have done better in my garage.

2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin.  There is no teaching whatsoever.

I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this.",1161475200,11,462,4.62962962962963
8121382,5,B000FEC2MU,"I bought this video for my son when it first came out and it is very entertaining.  He is 4 years old and is learning introductory phrases like hello and goodbye and also counting, etc.. This video is more unique than others I have found because it involves more story telling rather than teaching.  He likes it a lot.  Loves the live kung fu segment in the end.  The songs can be addicting as well.  Looking forward to the next video.",1159747200,,435,4.320987654320987
8121383,5,B000FEC2MU,"Hi,

I bought this video for my son-age 3 and he loved it.  The video is unlike anything that is out there.  They not only incorporate chinese phrases, but there is also a lot of singing and dancing.  My son particular likes the kung fu segment at the very end.  He asks for the video every day.  I would highly recommend this video to other parents.",1152057600,2,350,4.2272727272727275
