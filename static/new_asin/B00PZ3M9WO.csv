8689844,4,B00PZ3M9WO,"Strangely compelling portrait of a self-described ""Zen Master"" living in a lower middle class white suburb. The compelling realism of this biographical piece stems from the undeniable authenticity of the main character who is in nearly every frame of this well made and well edited short. The character, Dorian, shares the same name with the filmmaker, Dorian Dardar,  and the dirt track worn into the grass in the back yard where Dorian the character circumnavigates a tree for what seems like hours a day is either incredible dedication to detailed film making or a recording of real life events of Dorian Dardar, or someone very close to him. Whatever the reason, a confident, Zen-like approach to both the story and pacing permeates the piece, leaving the viewer with the distinct feeling that something deeper is going on here, though whether it is benign or disturbing is cleverly left dangling. Whether the answer to that koan is revealed by contemplation, a longer piece, or a sequel that will reveal more is in the talented hands and intriguing mind of Mr Dardar.",1419638400,,1072,4.955555555555556
