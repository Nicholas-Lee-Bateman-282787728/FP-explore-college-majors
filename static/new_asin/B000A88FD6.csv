2379417,5,B000A88FD6,"I didn't expect this to be so good. After sampling many bootlegs and the Rust Never Sleeps video, I expected this to be a mid-level collection item. Nope. It's great! The best of the lot - better than any NY DVD's or other VHS available so far. Enjoy!",1029542400,,251,4.25
2379418,4,B000A88FD6,"He's obviously not an NY fan.
The video was shot at the same time as the CD was recorded. The music is great - Young at his electric best, but surely better to see him stretching the srtings, teasing the harmonics or cranking out those rocking rhythms rather than long shots of matchstick men or the crowd mouthing the words.
We all know the words but we've paid to see Neil play.",987379200,5,380,4.291666666666667

8076121,5,B000A88FD6,"Man, this one is frustrating. Director Bernard Shakey, who did such terrific work on the ""Rust Never Sleeps"" and ""Live In A Rusted Out Garage"" video concerts, really lets us down on this one. Rather than focusing on Neil and Crazy Horse, the cameras spend FAR too much time zeroing in on the concertgoers. Yeah, we know that everyone in the crowd knows all the words to all the songs, but to ENDLESSLY have to watch them lip synch the words through the better part of this concert is annoying. We do get to see some fairly hot babes during ""Cinnamon Girl,"" but the rest of time we get to spend a LOT of cring-inducing time viewing average Joes playing air guitar/drums, pumping their fists into the air and singing along with Neil's songs.

Make no mistake, the band is terrific...Crazy Horse may never have sounded better than on this tour. And they're a lot of fun to watch...that is, when the cameras feature the band, which is where they should have stayed.

The five stars is for the music and performance of the band.

As a footnote: The album/CD mix for WELD and the Laser Disc (which is what I'm reviewing, transferred to DVD) mixes are markedly different. Neil and Billy Talbot messed with the album mix, adding overdubs and such, AFTER producer David Briggs was satisfied with the finished product. The album/CD resulted in a muddy, bass-heavy mix and bore a ""produced by Neil Young and Billy Talbot"" credit. The Laser Disc version retains the far-superior David Briggs mixes and production credit goes to David Briggs. Neil Young, in hindsight, has stated the ""real"" WELD is the Laser Disc.",1271376000,2,1601,4.690391459074733

8076123,5,B000A88FD6,"I'm not even the biggest Neil Young fan and this is my favorite concert video of all time.  Most of Young's best electric songs done full-tilt.  The only time I saw Young in concert was on this tour and it was amazing.  I had the Laser Disc.  It was never available on DVD, just Laser Disc and VHS.  The Blu Ray edition of this concert is at the top of my wish list.  Sadly, I think it will take a big grassroots movement to get this re-issued in HD.  Until then, the CDs will have to do.",1255132800,,488,3.9690721649484537

Produced by L.A.Johnson a.k.a. Neil Percival Young.
Directed by Bernard Shakey a.k.a. Neil Percival Young.

I love the shots of all the freaks in the audience.
I was one of those freaks at the Summit show that year!

Thanks Wharfie!",1182729600,,270,4.723404255319149

8076127,5,B000A88FD6,"Amazon lists this with a 2010 release date, but the rumor mill has this released shortly after Archives, Vol. 1, in late 2007/early 2008. (Along with The Complex Sessions, and Freedom Alive, also on DVD for the first time).

This is a great live concert from 1991 with Crazy Horse that is on par with ""Rust Never Sleeps"" from the late seventies. The reviews listed in the VHS section say it all....the highlights include the opening with Jimi Hendrix's version of the Star Spangled Banner blaring through the speakers, while a roadie sets up an oversized mike, as a homage to the road-eyes from ""Rust"". Then the peace sign in the background drops, revealing the Crazy Horse emblem, and the band plays ""Hey, Hey My, My"", and the concert is under way. Watch also for an electric version of Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind"".

Watching this concert from 1991, with it's anti-war imagery, demonstrates how little in the world has changed in 16 years. But thankfully, NY keeps rockin' in the free world.",1177372800,4,994,4.7398843930635834
8076128,5,B000A88FD6,"First of all, WHY NOT PUT THIS OUT ON DVD!!! What are they waiting for. This is by far the best Neil Young show available. The only two fighting for a close second is Rust and Live at Redrocks. This VHS beats all other VHS and DVDs on the market. Now that it is out of print you better preorder it. If you are a Neil Young fan then you collection is incomplete without this concert.",1139875200,5,382,4.0394736842105265
