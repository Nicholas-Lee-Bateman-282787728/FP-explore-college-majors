3646471,5,B001I4BR9A,"I highly recommend both of Janet Stone's DVDs.  The practice is beautiful, inspiring, challenging and unique.  I have never enjoyed a yoga video practice more;  it's the next best thing to being in a class.  Janet's love and study of yoga truly comes through as she calmly guides you through an energetic and flowing practice.  I find it to be a heart and mind opening journey that makes me feel strong and empowered.",1226188800,,417,4.657534246575342
3646472,5,B001I4BR9A,"I travel quite a bit for work so I asked one of my yoga instructors if he had any suggestions for a podcast/CD that I might take with me on the road, because I wasn't yet confident in my practice to do it completely solo. Janet does a fantastic job guiding you through the poses with her soothing voice, and the background music is mellow and great. The practice is rigorous (intermediate level I think), yet you can make it more/less intense with the options she provides throughout. Perfect for travelers who want to pop the CD in their laptop or transfer to their iPod (and great for saving $ while still getting a great class). Love it!",1224720000,2,640,4.432203389830509
3646473,5,B001I4BR9A,"I consider myself new to the practice of yoga and was looking for a DVD that I could use at home to get more comfortable with the idea of a classroom.  Not to mention, I'm so busy with work that I very rarely find the time to get to the studio.  My friend referred me to Janet's video and I've found that it's my favorite time of day.  I find it very balanced and agree with the previous post that it seems well suited for all levels.  I strongly recommend it!",1224201600,,460,4.021978021978022
3646474,5,B001I4BR9A,"It doesn't look like this disc is all too available, but it's worth getting if you are an interemediate yogi and in pretty good shape. There are a lot of movement repetitions - it's not exactly classical vinyassa yoga, but it is a fresh and interesting alternative!

I usually discard a lot of yoga discs because there are just not challenging enough. Not this one!

At first I didn't like the music, but it grew on me. It is very Eastern. The only thing that bothers me on this disc is all the idols!

Nice stage design. Pleasant and somewhat deep and interesting commentary. Janets got a nice voice and a mature attitude.

Nice disc.",1318204800,,635,4.495652173913044
3646475,5,B001I4BR9A,"As a yoga teacher and a devoted practitioner, I have been fortunate enough to practice with many amazing teachers from all around the world. Similarly, over the years I have watched literally every single yoga DVD I could get my hands on, always looking for the same three qualities I look for in a teacher: passion, innovation, and artistry. No one embodies these qualities quite like Janet Stone.

Janet Stone is a wonder; truly one of the most radiant and inspiring teachers I have ever known. Passion? She has it and then some. Her love for yoga, and the joy that sharing the practice bring her is self-evident. Innovation? Absolutely. Janet's sequences are some of the most innovative and exciting I have ever experienced. Artistry? No question. Just watching Janet flow from pose to pose is revelatory. Join her and you begin to create art yourself in collaboration with her golden voice and superb soundtrack.

This was the first DVD of Janet's that I ever experienced. Like all her DVD's, this one exudes all of the three qualities before you even press play, as the production quality of the packaging and disc pressing is first class in every respect. Everything you experience once the video is rolling is similarly phenomenal, from the menus to the soundtrack to the words of wisdom and meditation that permeate the practice. A bargain at any price. You deserve this practice.",1316563200,3,1388,4.877118644067797
3646476,5,B001I4BR9A,"Janet Stone's Radiant Flow is geared towards yogis/yoginis with some experience under there belts or at least very gifted beginner (e.g. flexible person coming from dance background).  The poses flow quickly and challenging.  For instance, Janet has a series that leads into a side crow pose (balancing your body on both arms one leg to the side the other straight back).  This in and of itself is not easy, but the sequence leading up to the pose is what really sets this apart from many yoga DVDs I've owned.  I have read some criticism of her DVDs that they are too expensive for what you get.  That you should get 2-3 sessions for the money.  Honestly, this one flow is better than anything else I've done to date and that includes accomplished Yoga instructors like Shiva Rea and Debbie Dobbins (both of whom make awesome Yoga DVDs, and I consider them the gold standard in this area.  So if you are an experienced practitioner looking for the next level in your yoga practice, this is a must buy.",1268870400,5,1002,4.595505617977528
3646477,5,B001I4BR9A,"I bought the 2 Janet Stone DVD's from her website , I am a Shiva Rea fan and I heard she was one of Janet's inspirations. If you own Shiva Rea's Fluid Power and Creative Core Abs you will notice a lot of the moves and variations of poses. I liked this practice better than Mellow Flow which I didn't find so mellow. Radiant Flow is challenging and fast paced though I wish it was slower so I can concentrate in the poses better but it is still a fun and sweaty flowing practice. Here is a description of the practice but I probably forgot some poses and it isn't necessarily in order - It starts sitting and chanting om once , then it moves to some poses in kneeling position like kneeling bow and kneeling side bow stretch. there were some up dog / down dog fluid vinysas , deep lunge with a tricep stretch , lunge with twist , chair with twist with no hold , just moving in and out of the pose 3 times each side. warrior 1 with eagle arms to warrior 3 with eagle arms  (tough) bound warrior 2 to triangle ,yogic squat to wide legged standing forward bend with several variations and tripod headstand , a full split , a strange lunge position that goes straight into side crow with legs straight (which you can see on youtube) , crow and the scorpion plank / down dog to side plank/bridge from Shiva's Dancing Warrior 1008 is repeated a few times throughout the practice. I have to say that I felt a burn in my legs after the standing sequence.
It also has a core sequence (similar to Shiva's) with backbends - dolphin to forearm plank with pulses and then sphinx to plank with pulses (tough), leaning back while kneeling and then camel pose. several core exercises on the back and bridge with several varaitions (with one leg for instance) plow to seated forward bend , supine poses and then plow again with shoulderstand ,then shavasana. I wish there were more backbends since it's a good preparation practice for backbends. the music is good (shaman's dream).",1248393600,17,1963,4.422651933701657
3646478,5,B001I4BR9A,"I've just done this DVD for the first time. I've been wanting both these DVDs (Radiant Flow and Mellow Flow) for a long time after trying her CD, so when my mother sent me some money for my birthday, I treated myself to both.
The flows were creative and interesting, balanced, heart opening, challenging, always in movement, in breath, in love. I am sitting here feeling like a flower that was just watered deeply and is now being embraced by the sun and the sweet air. I didn't want it to end. I wish I lived closer to San Francisco. I'd go to Janet's Saturday morning class every week that I could.
I'll let other reviewers be quantitative in their reviews. All I can really say is that I felt my own beautiful strength in everything I did in such a joyful and gentle way. I am convinced that if everyone did Janet Stone yoga, there would be Peace on Earth.
(Just a caution: This is not a beginner's practice, but definitely one to aspire to.)",1247270400,,945,4.375
3646479,5,B001I4BR9A,Janet and Shaman's Dream (the music) are the best part of my day. She makes me work hard while honoring and loving myself and my limitations. More advanced moves are so fun and challenging! I prefer this over Ashtanga now.,1237248000,2,222,4.575
3646480,5,B001I4BR9A,"This DVD is great because it is not boring beginner yoga.  It is interesting and challenging.  It is nice to see a DVD that is past the beginner stages.  For those that have been practicing yoga for a while and are bored with other DVD's this is the one for you!  It is inspiring, flowing & fun.  Janet is a great teacher.  I took her class while visiting San Francisco and came home to Florida and immediately bought both of her DVD's.  Enjoy!",1236643200,2,444,4.27710843373494
3646481,5,B001I4BR9A,"This is the best Vinyasa yoga DVD i have tried. Wonderful flow class with a nice mixture of advanced and more simple asanas. This will definitely get you sweaty and Janet Stone is a wonderful guide to keeping your practice soft and organic at the same time. Great production value - everything looks amazing!

3646482,5,B001I4BR9A,"A friend of mine gave this to me as a gift..she knew I wasn't too keen on some of the other discs I've tried.  She thought this one would do the trick!  She was right:  Janet's sequencing, the music and the overall 'vibe' of the material all make for a great session.  You really owe it to yourself to give this one a chance --  A great purchase...and much welcomed go-to gift when needed!",1230854400,,389,4.202702702702703
3646483,4,B001I4BR9A,"This is becoming a favorite, as I like this practice more each time I do it. And as a vinyasa yoga instructor, I've also gleaned a lot of new ideas for my own classes from her artful and unusual sequences. Those who are familiar with Shiva Rea's style of flow yoga will recognize quite a few of her signature moves here, and Janet also includes some variations and transitions I've never seen before.

This is on the faster and more flowy side of vinyasa yoga. Some may need a few practices to learn some of the more complicated vinyasas, but it's well worth taking the time. This is a real treat, from the beautiful set to the music by Craig Kohland (Shaman's Dream).

I'm only giving this four stars because:
1. The shavasana (final rest) is extremely short.
2. This is quite spendy for just a single practice, slightly more than an hour. There are no extras or options. For this price, it would have been nice to have a separate guided meditation or perhaps a longer practice with some length options. Still, if you get as much use out of your DVD library as I do, it's a very worthwhile purchase.

I don't recommend this for extreme beginners, or anyone with serious injuries, but intermediates will find a real challenge here and advanced students will enjoy the chance to practice with greater fluidity and creativity. I can't wait to try Janet's other DVD and see what she comes up with in the future.",1230768000,28,1408,4.535433070866142
8310440,5,B001I4BR9A,"I have yet to get through any of Janet Stone's yoga DVDs. Well, the 20 min. one for moms I did, but it  was really hard.
Still, I like her style. As difficult as these are. I have them all. My goal is to be able to DO them all by the end of 2018.",1514419200,,246,3.4727272727272727

8310444,2,B001I4BR9A,"Don't like for the same reason I didn't like Ananda Vinyasa. Too repetitive and gets too long and boring. Would do well with less repetitions and more variety of poses instead, found in most other yoga videos and classes. It would be more balanced and less boring. My body was craving many types of stretches and twists it's used to getting from a practice and not getting it here, so near the end I just turned it off and finished on my own with what I needed and what worked for me. Not going to do it again. I ordered it on the same day as Ananda Vinyasa, which I didn't like, wish I waited and didn't order both at the same time, after Ananda I wouldn't invest anymore money into this.

By the way, I got Ananda from Amazon and Radiant flow (along with Mellow flow) from the Janet Stone website. If anyone thinks of doing it, a warning. Customer service there is nonexistent. It took them 10 days to ship, and meanwhile I emailed a few times asking when it would ship, since there is no info at all on the site, and was ignored, except for someone telling me once they would forward my email to someone in shipping and they would get back to me, only no one did. After 10 days I emailed again asking to cancel the order and only then got a shipping notice, but still no human acknowledgement of any kind. So I regret the purchase in more ways than one. But if you want to order do it through Amazon at least or keep in mind my ordering experience from the website, in case you also start to wonder when it's shipping and why you are not getting responses to your questions.",1379894400,3,1577,4.239202657807309
8310445,5,B001I4BR9A,"Really interesting setting for the yoga workout, an old brick loft with lots of Hindu statues, flowers, and river rocks. Janet leads the small class of both men and women, each one dressed differently, a slightly different shape and height, and everyone achieved the poses differently. Very good video for men who are reluctant to do yoga as they think it is too feminine. The men in the video are very strong and athletic and masculine, and the women are that also...all quite lovely. Janet delivers excellent instructions in a voice over to the class. Fast flow...not much of a warm up. I suggest stretching and warming up before undertaking this workout.",1372032000,,657,4.875
8310446,5,B001I4BR9A,I have all of Janet's DVDs and this is one of my favorites. The routine is fun to do and the music great. The flow has some great balancing poses and nice core work but feels more like yoga to me then an exercise class. Perfect for a home practice.,1362700800,,248,3.98
8310447,5,B001I4BR9A,she is great. love her dvd's. love her voice. she is a great instructor. love the flow of it. feel like i am getting cardio in as well. great dvd.,1357862400,,146,3.9
8310448,5,B001I4BR9A,"If I could only have one it would be Janet Stone, and if I could only have one yoga DVD it would probably by this one.  However some days I have trouble deciding which is my favorite yoga DVD: Ananda Vinyasa or Radiant Flow.  Radiant Flow is better for me on the days when I want something really energizing, and I love Ananda when I am in the mood to be very introspective.

The Instructor:  Janet's narration is excellent.  The practice is very creative, but her guidance makes it very easy to follow.  She is one of the very few instructors who I feel like I can ""trust"" to take care of me the whole way through.  In addition to excellent cuing, her commentary is very inspiring.  She reminds you continuously to appreciate your body and what it does for you.
The Practice:  As I mentioned above, the sequence is excellent.  This is definitely Janet's most challenging DVD, but not in the way that wears you out.  It seems like a lot of yoga DVDs try to make it a workout and forget the deeper goals of yoga.  Not here.  Everything flows beautifully as if she can anticipate exactly what my body is going to need at each moment in the practice.  At the end I never feel like I wish I had gotten more attention in one area or another, or that there was a pose I wanted to do that we didn't do, or one I wished to have held longer.  To me this more than anything else is a testament to how great this DVD is.
The Music:  Absolutely perfect.  It adjusts throughout the practice so it complements what you are doing very well.
The Production and Scenery:  Gorgeous!

Before buying Radiant Flow I was a bit unsure because the DVDs are relatively expensive.  But there is a reason you can't find anything from Janet Stone used.  This practice is worth every penny and more; I'm even debating buying an extra copy in case I ""need"" this practice some day and for whatever reason my current DVD won't play.  I've been practicing yoga for 7 years and have worked with a lot of instructors and DVDs.  Janet is the best I have come across:  better in my opinion than Shiva Rea, Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, Seane Corn, Rodney Yee, and the list goes on.  Her practice has clear Shiva Rea influences, but I really like the way her DVDs are put together more than Shiva's.",1322179200,3,2259,4.34688995215311
8310449,5,B001I4BR9A,"After 10 years of practice things can get pretty repetitive, which is fine, but it's nice when I come across something new. Overall, I thought the sequence was pretty easy, but I really liked this DVD. I enjoyed her personality/teaching style so much that I signed up for one of her workshops at the yoga journal estes park conference. She's just like how she was in the video, if not slightly more fun and funky (funky in a good way :)",1319068800,,436,4.395061728395062
