7865316,1,6304140274,This is not the game.  It's only segments with no commercials.  Don't buy this product.  It's not the real game.  I want a refund..,1374796800,,131,4.333333333333333
7865317,5,6304140274,"Very well adited movie sequences for the Green Bay Packers 1996 Super Bowl winning champion game!  Being a Packers fan, I totally enjoyed the purchased video tape.",1316217600,,163,5.037037037037037
7865318,4,6304140274,This is more a highlight reel of the Packer's season and some history rather than a tape exclusively about Super Bowl XXXI.  But being a Packer's fan I thought it was great.,1309305600,,173,4.40625
7865319,5,6304140274,"Great narrative taking you thru the highs and one or two lows of the season, and the ebb of some of the most important games.  Funny to see Ted Thompson standing behind Brett Favre in two locker room scenes, hehe",1289174400,,212,4.3
7865320,5,6304140274,"Missed seeing this video 16 years ago, I never thought I would find one again. New condition and fast delivery.

7865321,5,6304140274,"Great video about a great season.........what more can I say?  Very well done, definately a must have for all cheeseheads!",1198972800,,122,5.1
7865322,4,6304140274,"This is a great way to remember the Packers the way they were, not the way they are now.  Let's bring Holmgren back. He was the best coach the Packers ever had.  Sorry Vince.  ""Bad Moon"" Rison's TD to start the game and Farve's excited run across the field should put shivers down the back of any loyal Packer-Backer!!",1130889600,2,318,4.3559322033898304
7865323,2,6304140274,"I am sure Packer fans will love it.  But for someone just interested in a super bowl video, I think this is the worst I've seen.  Not the ""traditional"" super bowl video.  More of a Packer retrospective.  As someone who now owns every super bowl video from the first to the 39th, I was dissapointed.",1127088000,,298,4.363636363636363
7865324,5,6304140274,This excellent video by NFL films is a must own for any Packer fan.  It tells the tale of a small midwestern city who go's on to dominate the NFL in a magical season(only in the NFL).  Plus it documents the day I had been waiting for and talking about all my life to that point watching my beloved Packers playing and winning the Super Bowl.  Like said before a must own for any Packer fan.  This video never gets old.,1020211200,3,418,4.1234567901234565
