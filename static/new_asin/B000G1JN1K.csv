8128377,5,B000G1JN1K,"""The Ballad of Little Joe"" precedes ""Mo and the big exit"".  They are both based loosely on Joseph and Moses, respectively. We really enjoy The Ballad of Little Joe VeggieTale DVD.  This one has one of the best silly songs ever, ""Bellybutton"".",1327449600,,242,4.738095238095238
8128378,3,B000G1JN1K,"I like Veggie Tales, and so do my kids.  We have 6 VHS tapes and a DVD, and we check them out from the church library now and again.  That said, I'm glad I only paid about $7 for this one.  It's my least favorite so far (except maybe Jonah).  It's short, and the special features (trivia game) malfunction.  My daughter kind of liked the trivia game on ""Moe and the Big Exit.""  Joseph's character is also fairly annoying for a protagonist.",1200268800,,439,4.2926829268292686
8128379,5,B000G1JN1K,"My children love this movie! It follows the story of Joseph very well even though they use a western setting. It is also enjoyable for the adults as well!

Veggie Tales never fails to deliver the right message in a wonderful and fun way!",1175644800,,237,4.386363636363637
