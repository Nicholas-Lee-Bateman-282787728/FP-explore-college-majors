1610425,3,B00005JXXX,"Parasite Eve (at least in its US release) is one of those direct-to-home movies that only bank off the success and popularity of the series it is slightly based on. That aside however... it's still a pretty bad movie (as well as DVD package).
Firstly, the film itself. I'm no aficionado on Japansese Cinema so I can't name who's who but I'll try my hand on a synopsis:
A professor's wife dies in a car accident. However, even after death, he refuses to let her go.(Now my memory gets hazy but) after tweaking with her [special] mitochondria, she is revived but has become a reincarnation of Eve, of whom the film is named after. Eve is the woman from the Old Testament and is the first traceable instance of Mitochondria co-existing with humans. Eve is angry and 1) has the cliche 'super offspring' with the professor as well as 2) has the ability to immolate (read: to cause to burst into flames) people by using the mitochondria that dwell within them. So the professor (naturally) realizes he shouldn't have played God and decides to stop her.
Blah. The acting is ok but don't expect some ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" expressiveness. The music is moving but nonetheless forgettable. The story is interesting to say the least but the ending is way too sweet and happy (in its own peculiar way) for my taste. Overall the movie is (surprise!) direct-to-video fare.
Now onto the DVD itself. ... Now to be more precise...
The main menu itself is just the cover shot of the film. No animations in the background. Just dull. BOO.
Dubbing is unavailable for those who hate reading subtitles (great for people like me, who often times find that dubbing just butchers the movie, or makes it worse than it already is). However, unfortunately, for those who understand Japanese and somehow want to experience the film again without subtitles, the DVD has hard subtitles. This means they can't be removed.
This movie isn't worth [the money] to the casual viewer but if you're a serious collector, it's worth a look.",1031270400,6,2009,4.742857142857143
1610426,4,B00005JXXX,"This DVD was not at all what I was expecting. I never knew exactly what Japanese Suspense was like, but after this movie, I do. It is a very good story, but in some parts it is very slow, due to the Japanese Suspense that was put in to it (I guess Japan likes to delay the movie instead of doing something else for suspense).
There are no mutating rats in this movie, but Eve DOES attack a large assembled group of people.",1011398400,,422,4.096385542168675
1610427,1,B00005JXXX,This was an awful awful movie. There was a reson it took so long for this title to reach North America. Because it sucks. The story makes absolutly no sense and the acting is terrible. I can't tell you about the special features because there aren't any which made it suck even worse. I wish I could give the piece of (...)0 stars. Be warned Stay Away.,1003795200,7,352,4.268656716417911
1610428,5,B00005JXXX,"I highly recommend this movie. This movie is not anime, but with real Japanese actors/actresses. The movie is subtitled. (If you don't like subtitles this might not be a movie for you.) This movie is great for the fans of the video game even though it doesn't follow the storyline of the game at all! The story is mostly independant from the game. The only negative I see with this DVD is that there is no English voice track, but it still great!",998870400,14,446,4.385542168674699
1610429,4,B00005JXXX,"Having seen this a few years ago in raw Japanese, I must say that I'm very pleased a company in the US finally picked it up for a domestic release. While certain scenes are a bit odd or silly, the whole atmosphere established by them combined with the ones that are chilling is one of suspense and breath-holding. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi/horror and the Parasite Eve games, but don't expect it to be like said games or even the novel it's based on. The plot is markedly different in several ways from the novel, including a character that doesn't even appear in said novel, and the link to the games is mostly the fact that this is the 'incident' that occured in Japan three years before the New York incident in the game. Still, it's a good watch. Now if only someone would translate the novel too ;)",997833600,8,827,4.411764705882353
1610430,4,B00005JXXX,"i really enjoyed this except it really did have some scenes that were just stupid. i bought this on vcd and i think it was worth it. i still reccomend it. contains: nudity, graphic violence, and suggeestive themes.",991094400,3,214,4.657894736842105
1610431,4,B00005JXXX,"This review is for the movie itself, and not the dvd. I saw the movie for the first time this year, and I have to say I wasn't expecting much. I've read reviews of the film for its original release, and I thought I might hate it also. However, I was totally taken in by this film. Sure there are some scenes that you might laugh at, but the movie has enough in it to make you forget them in time. Even though you might be a fan of the game, and notice that this movie isn't at all like it, you still have give this movie a try. You might be surprised at it.",989452800,4,557,3.8521739130434782
1610727,1,B00005JXXX,"My friend's sister rented this because that's what she does - rents horrible B movies that go straight to video for obvious reasons.

Not only are the special effects less than thrilling but the acting actually manages to disappoint and just plain annoy much more than the terrible CGI.

The main actress made me want to tear my eyes out. Her voice... oh my god.... That slow, unnaturally high-pitched, baby mew of a voice. Her chin was practically glued to her chest; every shot of her was high-angled so we can see those famous (infamous if you ask me) doe eyes that these actresses love to bat.

As for the score of the film, my dad and I were on the edge of our seats!  Boy, was that dramatic and suspenseful! Just waiting for the same exact song to play over and over and over and over and over.... Trying to clue us into what? Thinking anything in this movie is symbolic or important to the ludicrous plot?

Overall this is a waste of time and insulting to the viewer.",1221955200,,974,4.388888888888889
1610728,3,B00005JXXX,"I was very excited, as the other reviewers, to get this movie.  However, it left a dry taste in my mouth.  The movie is slow paced and confusing, but you don't need to have played the game to understand.
Mitochondria, an organizsm within the center of human cells, has its own DNA.  These organisms, which provide our cells with power, have decided it's time to rise up and take their place at the top of the foodchain.  The plot is the same for the game, only fills in the backstory and history of what happened in Japan.  (The game takes place in New York.)
It's not a bad movie, but it's not a very good one, either.",1087603200,2,619,4.256410256410256
1610729,3,B00005JXXX,"today i had just received my movie and watched it, and i was a bit disappointed. the movie was totally different than what i expected. its basically a love story and hardly any action and extremely dramatic. i thought the director could have given it a little more action and all but oh well. im sure the american version they are coming out with will be better. anycrap i give ""Parasaito Ivu"" three stars!",1063929600,2,406,4.5
1610730,4,B00005JXXX,"This movie was a great movie! I loved the game series so I figured I'd buy this movie. I must say I WAS disappointed to find that almost NOTHING from the game was in it, but the interesting storyline kept me watching. Yes, it is in Japanese BUT, there are subtitles. I recommend this to all parasite eve and movie fans!",1060819200,6,319,4.245901639344262
1610731,4,B00005JXXX,"Toshiaki Nagashima's opening lecture on mitochondria sets the premise of the movie.  Basically, within a cell, mitochondria has its own DNA, and is critical in creating energy.  Nagashima further states that mitochondria entered man as a parasite but became vital to humans and lived symbiotically.  Nagashima's studies involve growing healthy mitochondria, insert them in cells diseased by cirrhosis or diabetes, and curing said cells.  He is assisted in this by Sawako Asakura, a lab assistant working on her dissertation, on lab rats, and both are encouraged upon discovering that the livers of some rats have improved.
However, the question arises, do mitochondria have an agenda of their own, despite the fact that they don't have enough DNA to be independent?  And as a grade-schooler asks Asakura after she tells his class there are many helpful organisms inside the body, ""Won't they try to control us when we get big?""
The day of Nagashima's lecture also happens to be his first-year anniversary.  However, he never gets to celebrate it.  His timid and loving wife Kiyomi becomes involved in an accident that renders her brain-dead.  He is totally shattered, insisting that she is still alive.
Enter Dr. Yoshizawa, a surgeon who is desperately seeking a kidney donor to help a 12-year old girl, Mariko.  Her body rejected the previous donor's kidney, but this time, Kiyomi's data is assessed, with positive compatibility results.
Toshiaki finally agrees, on the condition that Yoshizawa gives him Kiyomi's liver.  Yoshizawa is perplexed by this agreement, but eager to succeed with Mariko, agrees.
The mystery begins when Mariko's new kidney begins acting strangely and she becomes alarmed by ominous liquid-like sounds burbling.  And at first, Toshiaki's culturing his dead wife's cells seem like the act of someone who has snapped, but the further the film progresses, we see how much Kiyomi meant to Toshiaki.  Unfortunately, things take a weird turn when Toshiaki examines one of Kiyomi's cell cultures.
Hiroshi Mikami does great as a typical research scientist, forgetful and absent-minded at times, and the haunted look on his face in reaction to his wife's death, and his obsession in keeping her alive, is some pretty good acting.  Riona Hazuki projects a fragile and gentle beauty as Kiyomi, especially in the scenes before her death and in the flashbacks we see when Toshiaki first meets her and is smitten.
The title Parasite Eve has to due with Nagashima's lecture that we all get mitochondria from our mothers, and one can see ""the mother of us all, the 'Eve' of mythology.""  Biology majors and students interested in biology may be interested in this not bad medical/sci-fi drama, which is leisurely-paced during the first half, but becomes more uptempo during the more suspenseful second half.",1060387200,16,2817,5.176211453744493
1610732,3,B00005JXXX,"This film actually serves as a prequel to the game ""Parasite Eve"", as the events that occur herein are referenced in the game, and the movie had been released prior to the game. However, whereas Parasite Eve contained a lot of action/thriller elements mixed with horror, the movie is mostly drama with some slight thriller and horror dusted over it.
If you want to see where the Parasite Eve games come from, I'd suggest either a rental or buying a used copy. But if you want something that's actually reminiscent of the games themselves, you'd do better to campaign for them to translate the game novelization that was released in Japan.",1056153600,2,638,4.756756756756757
1610733,4,B00005JXXX,"First let me tell you what this movie is not: It is not based on the games. It is not an action movie. It is not a horror movie. It is not a big budget special effects extravaganza. It is not anime. It isn't really a sci-fi movie either.
Now what it is: It is an excellent adaptation of a Japanese suspense/psychological thriller novel with subtitles. It has decent cinematography, excellent soundtrack and fairly good acting (for the most part). The story, while sometimes hard to follow for people unaccustomed to watching subtitled movies might be a little hard to follow at first, but there are only a handful of main characters that you have to keep track of so it isn't impossible.
If you aren't a foreign film buff, you might want to rent it, but if you enjoy foreign films (and don't mind subtitles), and Japanese drama/suspense in particular, then this is one you might want to add to your collection. If you are expecting an action packed, special effects laden, guns-a-blazing, people-dying-every-few-seconds movie based on the videogames ... look elsewhere. This isn't for you. This is a movie you have to watch and pay attention to to enjoy, and is probably better suited to adults for a number of reasons, most notably that younger people used to big budget Hollywood productions might find it slow moving and boring. I didn't.",1046131200,6,1341,4.759656652360515
1610734,3,B00005JXXX,"I am a long time fan of the game.  If you pay attention to the dialogues in the game, then the movie should make sense to you.  The movie is just the basis of the game...some will disagree that they are not related but the game takes place after the movie.
  With that said, I will go on with my review of the movie.  I watched it for the first time tonight and I thought that it was a little weird.  The storyline was a little hard to follow towards the end. Let me explain.  There are several storylines to begin with.  A sick child, her doctor, a scientist, and his wife.  The wife is in a crash.  She dies.  Her mitochondria is very...""active"".  Her organs are placed in the sick child...blah blah blah.  The childs mitochondria begin to reproduce.  And she is going to have a mitochondria baby even though she is like 12.  Confused yet? Figured you were. And believe me it doesn't get any better.  I'm still trying to figure out the ending myself.
  Bottom line.  The movie is ok.  Not real scary so if that is what you want or expect then this is NOT the movie for you.  The CGI is ok...compared with American CGI...mind you this is a Japanese film.  There are subtitles and the parts are played very well.  So, if you wanted to know the story behind the game...or if you read the book and thought it was great then this movie is the perfect choice.  Happy viewing!",1044489600,3,1371,4.265625
1610735,5,B00005JXXX,"ok this movie is worth buying, great storyline, decent special effects, if you tired of watching the same ole horrow movies and want to watch something diffent then this will not dissapoint. BUY IT <g>",1043452800,,201,4.771428571428571
1610736,4,B00005JXXX,"For one, those who are expecting a movie based on the game, stop now.  Unless you payed close attention to the game, you will hate this movie.  The movie is based off the novel, not the game.
I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone, however the story is very good, and you will not be left wanting.  My only gripe with the story is the ending, which is a tad bit perplexing.  The CGI is well done, and not over-used.  And the story is one of the saddest, most tear-grabbing, heart-filled movie I have ever seen.  You fall in love with the main character and his wife, you feel their pain, and come to understand their actions.
This movie is a defiante buy for anyone who really loved the game, novel, or is a lover of sci-fi/horror movies, especially with a love sub-plot.
And that's that.",1032739200,4,793,4.324324324324325

7942584,5,B00005JXXX,Great movie.  If you liked the Parasite Eve video games then this is awesome.  Even if you haven't played the games you'll still like the movie.  It's a subtitled movie so if that's an issue for you then you may want to skip it.  I normally don't like subtitled movies but since I was a fan of the games I gave it a shot.  I wasn't disappointed.,1482796800,2,345,4.08955223880597

One of the few movies that stays fairly true to the book source material. The effects are pretty decent given everything this involves. A great recommendation for those who enjoy the Parasite Eve Franchise.",1429488000,,390,4.507042253521127

7942588,4,B00005JXXX,"Liked this movie enough to buy it, especially since it isn't readily available elsewhere (i.e. Netflix). Typical of movies from Japan, the cinematography is excellent, although the movie develops pretty gradually -- think the Serge Leone spaghetti westerns, for example. Not a horror move so much as a tale of terror with character evolution. Not for everyone, but if you like Kurosawa you will probably like this.",1406764800,,414,5.1940298507462686

7942590,4,B00005JXXX,"I saw this movie years ago before ever playing the games on TV and liked it alot, I thought the DVD had English Dub, but other then that it's still a good movie.  It's based off the book of the some name not the game, and this come out one year before the game, and the game is a sequel of the book and movie.  The Story is, that after a Man's wife dies, he tries to bring her back with science, but instead makes a monster call Eve.  I do recommend this movie, but as I said it's subbed not dubbed.",1348617600,,499,3.872549019607843
7942591,4,B00005JXXX,"I want to make it clear that this movie is so great because it's terrible. The plot makes absolutley no sense whatsoever,so don't bother trying to make connections. The ideas behind it are so contrived it could only come out of a B-movie. But if you want a fun movie night with your friends,this is good to keep around and have some laughs at.

Basically,the idea behind the premise is that human mitochondria(remember from high school science class,""the powerhouse of the cell""?),is really a foreign body in the cell that has evolved alongside humankind. What we don't know is that our mitochondria are really parasites,lying low in our bodies for millions of years until we evolved to the point where they could use us to take over...the world,I guess?I'm not really sure. And they do this by spontaneously combusting the people whose cells they make up?Like I say,it makes no sense,even explaining it.

The beginning starts off kinda good but slow;the first 45 minutes or so is more of a drama of relationships,where we meet our young doctor protagonist(I forget his name,but the actor who plays him is really cute,so we'll call him Cute Doctor),and his young wife,either Yume or Yuke(I'm going with Yume...sorry,I only saw this once).It's their first wedding anniversary and he's FORGOTTEN the occassion! Then Yume gets into a car accident and is put on life-support later that day,and he's forever filled with regret. We're treated to lots of long shots of Cute Doctor sitting mournfully by rain-streaked windows,hating himself and the world.

Enter another doctor who we'll call Desperate Doctor. He's been treating a little girl across the city with some kind of disease that he hasn't been able to cure,and feels a need to prove to her that he can make her better. When he discovers that Yume's kidneys are a perfect match for Little Sick Girl,he begs Cute Doctor to let him have one. Apparently,in this reality,people can't survive after losing a single kidney as they can in the real world,but can survive with their livers removed. Cute Doctor,in a frenzy of loss and mania to bring Yume back,decides that the experiments he's been doing on rat liver cells would go better with Little Sick Girl's liver cells.

This is the part of the movie where any meaningful storyline goes away and things start to get seriously weird. They make the trade and Cute Doctor mixes Yume's cells with Little Sick Girl's liver cells in petrie dishes,maniacally cooing to them,""You're still with me through these cells,Yume!""He doesn't know that Yume's mitochondria are seriously psycho and have maneuvered both of them to the position they're in now. Without revealing too much,everything goes COMPLETELY nuts and the horror element of the story sets in,not taking any care to make any sense in the meantime.

Like I say,it's a bizarre movie that has no logic to it,but it can be really fun if you grab a bunch of friends and some popcorn and just have a good time with it. Get it for Teh Lulzs.",1275264000,,2987,4.872047244094488
