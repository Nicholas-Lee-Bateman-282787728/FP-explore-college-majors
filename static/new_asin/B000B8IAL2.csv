8517761,1,B000B8IAL2,"When I tried returning this item which was purchased by mistake, they refused to refund the full amount because they CLAIM the item (DVD) was not sealed when it was returned. They do not have anything posted on the website or at thier store on their return policy which I got confirmation on through amazon. If I would have known of this policy, I would of never tried to return the product. When I attempted to explain to the seller of the situation, not only did they refuse the full refund but were extremely rude by saying why should I refund the whole amount when the seal was broken and and lose money and I'm putting it lighting. This is unacceptable service and I recommend to anyone not to buy from them",1371772800,5,712,4.401515151515151
