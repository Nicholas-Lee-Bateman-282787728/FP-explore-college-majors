2993126,5,B000WZALZ2,"In the tradition of ""Dude, Where's my Car?,"" ""Cheech and Chong,"" and ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" Stone & Ed doesn't disappoint.  It may be a smaller, independent film, but it is a very polished final product.  Cameos from celebrities, a little gratuitous nudity, confusing situations and action.  Grab some munchies, find your favorite spot on the couch and enjoy.  Sure to be a cult classic once it catches on.",1196035200,4,421,4.9714285714285715

8226207,1,B000WZALZ2,"You think you cant go wrong on a stoner movie but boy they screwed this one up. Its like someone wanted to make a stoner movie that never smoked in there life. At best its a real real real bad rip off of ""dude wheres my car"" I say this cause it will kill your buzz if you watch it high.. So avoid this one at all costs",1270339200,,318,3.6911764705882355
8226208,1,B000WZALZ2,"I bought this movie reading all the other reviews and thinking it would be funny to watch ....It was not.  It actually put me to sleep and it was not the dope.  This was a dumb fuken movie, not funny.  I was actually predicted what was going to happen before it happened, god it was dumb.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for sarcastic people, stoners, people with an actual sense of humor and I don't mean those ha ha funny type. I don't know how to say it, boring, boring, disappointing, dumb, boring, and a waste of money.",1239235200,,525,4.326530612244898
8226209,1,B000WZALZ2,"This movie will only become a ""cult classic"" if we can find a cult devoid of taste.

Look, Travis Wester stars in this film & I was a good friend of his through high school and beyond. I pull for him, and want to see him succeed in quality, successful films. EuroTrip was such a movie. Stone & Ed is not.

Everything about this film is poor. Plot. Acting. Directing. ""Humor."" Music. It aspires to be low brow and doesn't ever get there, fizzling out somewhere below the nose.

Several people here have given this film 5 stars. I can't imagine how that is, or what a 3 star film must be to them! Maybe this is the only film that they have ever seen. But take it from a reviewer who has seen more than this, has seen stoner comedies better than this, has seen slacker comedies better than this, has seen stupid comedies better than this, has seen cult comedies better than this: Stone & Ed is a bad movie.

When Travis makes a good one, I'll be the first to let you know.",1207180800,,969,4.193548387096774

8226211,5,B000WZALZ2,"Although this wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, I did enjoy it. It was a fun 90 minutes of some pretty ridiculous stuff. Cool characters and some pretty funny scenarios.
As far as low budget films go, this is a fun one. Check it out.",1202515200,2,239,4.1063829787234045

8226213,5,B000WZALZ2,I really enjoyed this movie because it's just so easy and fun to watch.  it's the kind of movie that I can see myself popping in the dvd player saturday mornings and just lounging out while laughing myself silly.  It acomplishes everything it sets out to do,1201478400,,257,4.446808510638298
