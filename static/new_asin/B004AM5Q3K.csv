4310004,5,B004AM5Q3K,"This movie was an unexpected surprise;  Punching the Clown was hilarious!  I'm not a huge fan of a lot of singing in movies, but this movie wasn't like that--the songs were more comedic.  I'd recommend!",1302566400,7,202,4.714285714285714
4310005,5,B004AM5Q3K,"Sarah Silverman has become a champion of this gem, and I thank her for it, because I probably would have missed it. The best thing about this firecracker of an indie film, apart from the cleverness or it, the wonderful songs and the belly laughs it induces, is the fact that I had never seen any of these actors before and they're all wonderful. So it just feels like a great find. It's one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years. If I had to compare it to something else, I would say a less goofy, more realistic ""This is Spinal Tap"", or a funny ""Tender Mercies"" or ""Crazy Heart."" Great stuff.",1299110400,4,602,4.2894736842105265
4310006,5,B004AM5Q3K,"Perfect timing: the morning after the most boring Oscar night in recent memory, I get Punching the Clown in the mail. Funny, subtle, warm, intelligent, original, great satirical songs. Watching it made my whole week.  It's a little rough around the edges... doesn't look like 100,000,000 bucks... Who cares. It's brilliant.  There is hope yet for American independent film.",1298937600,4,373,5.305084745762712
4310007,4,B004AM5Q3K,"If you just quickly scan the description you might miss that is  SLAMdance not SUNdance winner. Slamdance was created for all the great films that can't make it into Sundance. Unless you live in LA, you probably won't recognize anyone in this smart little film so it seems more like a documentary. A lot of the humor hits on inside acting/performing jokes but you will still enjoy the music and characters on their own. Everybody knows somebody like these characters.",1295654400,3,467,4.8375
4310008,5,B004AM5Q3K,We had a movie in the 2009 Austin Film Festival and happened to see this one.  It was sort of a fluke.  We were actually there to see the movie that played before it and just decided to stay.  Punching the Clown ended up being one of my favorite films of the festival.  I've gone out of my way to check for it here on Amazon every couple of months.  I'm glad to see it's finally available.  It's important to support awesome little labors of love like this one.,1289088000,16,461,4.123595505617978

4310020,5,B004AM5Q3K,"So its another one of those narcissistic pity-me films, but I thought this film was  just hilarious and brilliant in script, song, and the character portrayal of the stereo typical douche bags you encounter in the entertainment world of LA.",1465257600,2,240,5.0
4310021,4,B004AM5Q3K,"A very funny movie, with a  good story, good writing, and very funny music.  The content itself, I have no complaints about, but the main issue with this movie is the editing. It's probably the most poorly edited professionally made film I've ever seen. Some of the cuts are incredibly jarring, with different levels of ambient noise, which is incredibly noticeable. It was difficult for me to watch a few scenes in this movie because the editing and sound mixing is so painfully bad.",1463184000,,484,4.75
4310022,5,B004AM5Q3K,"Laugh out loud funny, super observant singer/comedian performs misanthropic slightly sexist songs and lives.",1462665600,,108,6.785714285714286

4310026,4,B004AM5Q3K,"Great insight into the pitfalls of building a standup comedy career.  Henry's songs are poignant and hysterical.  Cool cameos from modern comedy's best (Pepitone, Nikki Glaser, etc.).  Recommend!  Also recommend the brand new sequel, AND PUNCHING THE CLOWN, which killed at SXSW 2016.  Making the funny ain't always pretty.",1458259200,,323,5.510204081632653

4310031,3,B004AM5Q3K,"I was so emotionally prepared to like this film. I'm a huge fan. I saw all his cooking videos on youtube at least 10 - 50 times each and was quietly hoping the movie would be just as uproariously funny as his simple 5-minute youtube instructional videos. At about 1/2 hour in, I was distracted enough to start surfing the web. I hope his currently filming sequel has more laughs.",1440720000,,379,4.428571428571429
4310032,2,B004AM5Q3K,Very slow. Not what I thought it would be. Not as funny.,1436918400,,56,3.75
4310033,4,B004AM5Q3K,"If you've never seen any of his videos in youtube you would laugh your ass off, if you have seen his videos you would think that this movie is a beautiful montage  of all his videos in youtube. It could have bring something exclusive in the movie but it does not.",1433462400,,263,4.1568627450980395

I love showing this to people and blowing their minds at how they've never heard it before. 10/10 in my movie list.",1428710400,,188,4.696969696969697
4310036,5,B004AM5Q3K,"The only thing funnier than Henry Phillips' YouTube cooking videos are his albums, and the only thing funnier than his albums is this movie. Watch it before the sequel comes out!",1426118400,,178,4.774193548387097
4310037,5,B004AM5Q3K,"I am a Henry Philips fan, so I would probably like this movie no matter how bad it is.  Having said that, it is actually a good movie.  I think someone who doesn't even know who Henry Philips could enjoy it.",1420156800,,207,4.024390243902439
4310038,2,B004AM5Q3K,I heard him on a radio interview and it sounded interesting. I was wrong.  Don't waste your time on this,1411776000,,104,4.2
4310039,5,B004AM5Q3K,An amazing little movie. Was exactly like the real life experience of seeing Henry. Sorta sad yet hysterical,1407715200,,108,5.055555555555555
4310040,4,B004AM5Q3K,This movie satire documentary displays the low level of intelligence when it comes to entertainment. It is done in a dark comedic way. Refreshing and enjoyable.,1406332800,,160,5.1923076923076925
4310041,5,B004AM5Q3K,I have watched this movie repeatedly and it never fails to make me laugh.  Henry Phillips is extremely talented and funny and I suggest this film to anyone with a sense of humor.,1403481600,,178,4.393939393939394
4310042,4,B004AM5Q3K,"If you like Henry Phillips you will like this movie.  The movie does a great job of mixing Henry's wit and comedic timing with things that happen in his everyday life.  If you have followed Henry's comedy you can believe each of these little anecdotes actually happened to him.

I also liked how Henry mixed in some of his legendary songs and performances...just the right touch.

You can't help but feel sorry for Henry and at the same time laugh your ass off.",1401408000,,461,4.518072289156627
4310043,5,B004AM5Q3K,Very funny and creative in its approach. It's too bad a film like this is not more well know but I guess with out star actors it makes it hard. Everyone was terrific and makes me want to download the soundtrack.,1400889600,,211,4.170731707317073
4310044,3,B004AM5Q3K,"LA guitarist/humorist Henry Phillips does his best to carry this ""Spinal Tap-ish"" documentary on his shoulders but therejust isn't quite enough for him to do. I have no doubt that making it in show business can involve pestering 99 people until that hundredth comes along that can get you to the next venue.  There are also strange coincidences and misunderstandings he uses to full advantage.  I still gave it 3 stars for a couple of genuine laughs and because this is a one man show all the way, you can forgive the main character being mildly annoying.",1394409600,,555,4.711340206185567
4310045,4,B004AM5Q3K,"My only complaint is I wish it included the full version of the songs.  Introduced it to some friends, and left them wanting more.",1388620800,,130,4.416666666666667
4310046,5,B004AM5Q3K,"Very funny indie movie from a very funny musician/songwriter/comedian.  I hadn't heard of Henry Phillips before this movie and am happy to have found this kind of humor and good writing.  For those that are in the music industry you can probably relate to every situation very easily and for those that aren't it's still a very funny movie.  It may seem slow going but the humor is in there, just have to watch.",1377734400,,411,4.527027027027027
4310047,5,B004AM5Q3K,"A side-splitting blend of dead-on satire and hilarious music, this is a film about every performer's nightmare. Comedian Henry Phillips plays a mocking version of himself: an unknown folk singer-songwriter, mortifying nightclub act, and perennial failure. Living on the road but running out of luck and money, he arrives in Los Angeles to crash with his loser brother (Matthew Walker), meets a bumbling agent (Ellen Ratner), and falls into the shallow end of the entertainment scene (there is no deep end).

Through a series of chance encounters with pretentious phonies, vicious backstabbers, and vacuous rumormongers in the music biz and the media, Henry's fortunes undergo a sudden rise (he signs a recording contract) and even more precipitous fall (he's pilloried as a racist). The storyline is punctuated by awkward attempts at romance, humiliating miscommunications with nearly everyone, and a unique form of standup comedy. Henry's intros are just as funny as his songs, whose hysterically caustic and subversively confessional lyrics belie his meek, earnest demeanor.

I laughed throughout the movie, enjoying the farcical absurdity of the situations and the hapless people in them. If you're a fan of Louis CK, Sarah Silverman, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and especially Flight of the Conchords, you really must see it.",1377129600,3,1323,5.41747572815534
4310048,5,B004AM5Q3K,I'm so glad that this movie was recommended to me.  Henry Phillips is hilarious!  If you like musical comedy -- like Flight of the Conchords -- then you'll love it.,1366156800,,164,4.433333333333334
4310049,5,B004AM5Q3K,"There are few things I remember more vividly than the first time I watched this piece of film.
My first kiss, humans landing on the moon, 9/11, these are all dates and memories which fall flat in comparison to the life changing experience of this movie.  This film is a journey, not only the journey of a socially awkward folk sing by the name of Henry, but also a journey you must undergo, a journey you take through life, a journey you take through your thoughts.  I used to have no life, now, this movie is my life.  In the beginning I would have fun watching Punching the Clown, now I need to watch Punching the Clown to have fun.  Henry Phillips has completely taken control of my life, he is all I have, he is my friend, my family, my hero. He is me. Thank you Henry.",1365724800,,773,4.202702702702703
4310050,5,B004AM5Q3K,"If, like me, you enjoy humorous breaks from mainstream entertainment, the title of my review tells you all you need to know about this subtle, small-stage comedy.",1358553600,2,162,5.037037037037037
4310051,5,B004AM5Q3K,"Very funny.  I've bought copies as gifts and they were very well received.  Check out youtube for more Henry Phillips video (""duet"" is particularly good).  Henry also makes an appearance in the Mike Birbiglia movie ""sleepwalk with me""",1357344000,2,234,5.105263157894737
4310052,5,B004AM5Q3K,We purchased this movie for our son and daughter-in-law as a way to 'treat' them to the movies.  They loved it as much as we did.,1356739200,,129,3.9615384615384617
4310053,5,B004AM5Q3K,"I've seen this movie 3 times.  It's hilarious like ""Spinal Tap"", but drier.  It captures LA like some of Steve Martin's finest moments in ""LA Story"", but goes beyond, because it's not Hollywood, it's Indie.  There are many memorable bits that you'll find yourself (and friends and family) quoting so often, that you have to put a stop to it.",1350604800,2,341,4.65
4310054,5,B004AM5Q3K,"Movie morphine! Funny, refreshing, unique feel good screwball blackish musical comedy. This is an underrated little known indy gem of 2009. Great interior shots, inner workings and maxims of vapid Hollywood. Thumbs up from a Vegas hipster movie junkie. Definitely worth watching and hope it holds up second time around.

This movie stands out in a league of its own so its tough to compare but if you like this check out Joe Dirt, Shakes the Clown, I Heart Huckabees, Louis C.K.",1341014400,2,478,4.829268292682927
4310055,5,B004AM5Q3K,"I just stumbled on this with zero expectation and laughed through just about the whole thing. Very witty and well done and highly entertaining, with much truth to it. People in the music business especially should dig it.",1321574400,3,221,4.842105263157895
4310056,5,B004AM5Q3K,"The story of a singer/comedian who comes to Los Angeles to seek his fortune, and his account during his brief stay there.  Henry Phillips sings folk songs that are not really folksy with lyrics that are impossible to sing along to.  People who prefer Curb Your Enthusiasm over Seinfeld may appreciate the humor in this indie film.  It's not a laugh a minute, because there's actually some kind of story involved here. But I found myself actually falling back in my swivel chair and laughing hard during some scenes.  The humor is based on character and awkward situations.  The way Henry Phillips gets mischaracterized as an anti-semitic folk singer reminds me of the best parts of Curb Your Enthusiasm.  There are also some ususual characters that remind me of the offbeat Life and Times of Tim.  Henry is a sort of everyman placed into weird and uncomfortable situations.  This is not sitcomy Steve Carroll humor - it's subtle, intelligent, ironic and politically incorrect.",1321142400,,976,4.9447852760736195
4310057,5,B004AM5Q3K,"If you love music, songwriting, and/or comedy, this is a great movie to buy.  We saw it by chance on Netflix and instantly had to own it.  Great story about the crazy career of a comedic songwriter.  Great story, songs, and singing.  Enjoy!",1314921600,2,240,4.511627906976744
