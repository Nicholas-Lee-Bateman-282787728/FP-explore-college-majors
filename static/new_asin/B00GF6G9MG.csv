8622582,5,B00GF6G9MG,"I ordered this dvd to replace an old VHS tape, from an ESPN film.  This has always been a favorite video of one of my favorite fighters, Ray ""Boom Boom"" Mancini.  This set also includes many of his fights, some I had already, but on VHS.  And just in time, as Ray is going into the boxing Hall of Fame this year.
This dvd, ""Triumph And Tragedy"", is about the tragedy of Ray's bout with Duk Koo Kim.  Kim died in the hospital a  few days after Ray defended his lightweight championship, after an exciting display of skills and courage from both participants.  At the time of this match, Mancini was possibly the most popular boxer in the U.S., with TV appearances and commercials already under contract and more in line.  Afterwards these disappeared.  Ray had already won the world's championship, dedicating the win to his father, the original ""Boom Boom"" who was drafted into the Army and did not get his earned title match.  He was wounded in action and his boxing days were all but over.  Because the fight was on Saturday afternoon TV and was seen by millions, it drew more attention.  The sanctioning bodies changed the title fight length from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds, and this eliminated was had been known as the ""championship rounds.""
Ray continued his career, but it was difficult for him, being responsible for the death of an opponent, even though boxing deaths had occurred before, even happening in bouts that were won by other champions, such as Ray Robinson and Ezzard Charles.  Ray was deeply affected by this and his career was shortened, as a result.  ""Triumph And Tragedy"" is the story of that bout, what happened after and how this was handled by Ray, an exciting athlete, extremely popular man, but sensitive to the Kim family.  Ray's meeting with Kim's son is a concluding part of this video.
For me, Ray was a two-fisted boxer, fearless and confident, ready to exchange with all opponents.  I looked forward to watching his fights and after the career ended, watching his appearances on ESPN and in other mediums, such as the movies he was involved in.
The Hall of Fame awaits him.
