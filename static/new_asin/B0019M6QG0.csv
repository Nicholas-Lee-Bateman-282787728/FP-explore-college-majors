8274508,2,B0019M6QG0,"7 Habits team - I recommend pulling this product from the market!!  Viewers - I recommend buying the book or audio! I am sad to leave a 2 star review, but this video does no favors for the 7 Habits brand.  I have read the book multiple times, taken a life-changing workshop, and regularly quote principles.  Thinking a video would be great to watch 20 min 2-3 times each week with my team at work (like we've done multiple times with the Secret), I have been extremely disappointed.  It is so slow that it is actually boring to ME, and I am one of those that will watch leadership speeches and keynotes all the time for fun.  In 20 minutes we are all snoozing, bored, every time.  Also, it is highly distracting to all of us that the audience and video quality are from the '80s.  We simply cannot relate to these people anymore, I'm sorry to say.  The only reason for the 2 stars is that the content I happen to be a strong advocate for - this is just not the way to learn it, or share it with others.",1413590400,4,1002,4.182291666666667

8274510,5,B0019M6QG0,"I read the book, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, years ago and as all of us do, kinda-sorta remembered some of it, but truly forgot most of its principles.  This video really helped to jog my memory, especially when Dr. Covey told some of the stories he used in the book to illustrate specific teachings (the goose that laid the golden egg, fighting with a lighthouse, etc.).  I watched this through Netflix, and liked it so much that I ordered it for my personal video library.",1311724800,4,483,4.540229885057471
8274511,5,B0019M6QG0,"After having read the book, it was great seeing it in workshop form. Stephen Covey is a great story teller and that made the video even more effective and impactful than the book for me. Excellent overall!",1265932800,7,205,4.5675675675675675
8274512,1,B0019M6QG0,"We found it to be boring and dry, like a college lecture.
Although it made some good points, it didn't hold our
attention well and we never finished watching it.
We thought it would make a good sleep aid.",1265587200,6,204,4.256410256410256
8274513,5,B0019M6QG0,"S. Covey will save you time and trouble by going to the root of ""Life"" and ""Time"" management! Forget time managenent learn how to organize your life.
There is ""hacking at the branches"", then there is ""chopping out the roots"", Covey does the latter.
Quit wasting your time, reading this should be required by the time you are an adult.",1252800000,9,334,4.583333333333333
