8061652,5,B0009IWFU6,Great introduction to the park. Headed there this summer and the beautiful photography and information are allowing me to make plans  as well as provide a record of the scenery after the trip. Own several of these Halliday dvds and have never been disappointed.,1495152000,,261,4.931818181818182
8061653,3,B0009IWFU6,"If you have ever been to Glacier, this video will be a massive disappointment. Most of the droning narrative is focused on The Going to the Sun Road and what you can see without getting out of your car. Glacier is much more than this. Glacier is a hikers park, yet hiking is barely addressed throughout. All the standard images are here - the Jammers, Wild Goose Island, Many Glacier Hotel. There is nothing in-depth and this is unfortunate. Don't let this video steer you away from a visit though, it is a must to see and experience.",1397433600,,534,4.459183673469388
8061654,5,B0009IWFU6,"I loved, just loved Glacier when I was there in August 2005. Totally relaxed. Got close enough to a mountain goat that I could have petted it if I had wanted. Saw kids from less than 100 yards, even. (Not sure that's totally good, of course, for wild animals to be that acclimated, but that's another story.)

Anyway, you can see all this and more... the shrinking glaciers before they disappear, the grizz (seem by me at 450 yards at Many Glacier) and more, all in this wonderful DVD.

The bonus is footage of Canada's adjoining Waterton Lakes National Park; the two, together form the International Peace Park, a tribute to the special relationship between our countries.",1136160000,,673,4.743589743589744
