If you have never seen one of Lamarre's films, see this one. It focuses on what happens in a church. Vivica plays an old flame. Sheryl Lee Ralph plays a strict church woman, Clfton Powell plays a man who is refuses to marry his woman and Kel Mitchell plays a minister who finds a new director played by the beautiful. YoYo. This was a well written film. Recommended for fans of church comedies.",1417392000,,537,4.2745098039215685

8504781,2,B006UTDFZC,"I have enjoyed some of the earlier Jean Claude Lamarre movies. But this one made me winch after almost every ""joke"" in the script, due to the laugh track. I find laugh tracks annoying, which made watching this movie an impossible feat. I know when I find things funny and don't have to be told where the joke is. I believe this might have been a good movie had it not been for that one thing. My advive to Mr. Lamarre is this: Leave the laugh tracks to tv situation comedies. (And if you notice...most tv shows don't use them any longer)",1332720000,2,537,4.2745098039215685
