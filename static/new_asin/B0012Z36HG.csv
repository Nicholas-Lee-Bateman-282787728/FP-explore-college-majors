8248413,5,B0012Z36HG,"Both my 9 year old daughter and 6 year old son were mesmerized by these Baby Faith videos for YEARS!  They still talk about some of the characters in the videos and you can't beat the stories of love and faith that your children get, especially compared to junk on Disney these days.

We were excited to gift these to my sister in law and husband for her first child.  We know they'll be looking for more in this series, and we'll have an easy, appreciated gift idea for many occasions to come!",1399075200,,494,4.290322580645161
