8218809,3,B000VI6SZ2,"A fairly decent rendition of the novel, but slips badly at the ending. In the novel, the ending has Mr Polly victorious in fighting off a bully. In this version, he basically is portrayed as a coward who wins by pure accident. And that's the opposite of what the novel says, so yeah, a poor version from that point of view. As well, the novel is set in Sussex and Kent, but this was filmed in Wales, and the light and the landscape are just not the same, so a few points deducted for that too. The basic shape of this version is very close to the 1948 John Mills version, although it does include a bit of Polly's childhood, which the '48 version entirely skips.",1522022400,,662,4.261904761904762
8218810,4,B000VI6SZ2,"To my knowledge,this was never aired in Australia. That's a pity. I'd always liked this rather atypical HG Wells tale. There aren't any aliens from Mars or time travellers from another century. It's a simple but heartwarming tale of a man who goes to great lengths to answer that question we all seek to answer in our lives:what makes me happy? Mr Polly goes to great lengths to find out and his ending is very far removed from its beginning.
This video version of the novel succeeds in a pleasant,understated way. The settings are attractive,the characters amusing as well as genuine.
The opening scene on the rocky headland,where Mr Polly considers his life and its pluses and minuses,is both moving and spellbinding. The players are well cast,with the villain/s awesome and the goodies believable. This is a very enjoyable film and one that could be watched more than once.",1206662400,16,876,4.885906040268456
