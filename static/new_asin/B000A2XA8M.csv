Your cellular phone rings with a ringtone you did not supply to it.

You check it and see that someone has left a message for you.

The ""someone"" who left the message for you was... YOURSELF!

The message is time-stamped as having been made SEVERAL DAYS IN THE FUTURE!

You retrieve the message you received from yourself and hear yourself talking to you.

Suddenly, you hear a blood-curdling scream -- YOUR scream!

Then... silence.

Welcome to the preview of your impending violent death. Have a nice day.

I was both surprised and disappointed that this popular entry into the ""A-Horror"" (""Asian Horror"") nabemono pot has now also been snatched up for an official US/Canada ""Region-1"" DVD release. Soon, I won't be able to purchase ANYTHING from the International DVD market in any of the various other ""Region-coded"" formats, since it's beginning to seem that they all are eventually going to be co-opted for release in North America. (At least I can ""STILL"" gloat, for the time being, from knowing that there will NOT be an official ""Region-1"" DVD release of the ORIGINAL 1954 Japanese version of ""GOJIRA"" [""Godzilla""] for a very long time -- so I'll be enjoying the elite privilege of viewing my ""Region-4"" DVD of the same, while the rest of you will have to deal with shifting cinematography quality, bad dubbing and Raymond Burr!)

[Note: When (""if"") the situation with ""Gojira"" mentioned above should ever change beyond the time of this writing, please disregard that previous paragraph.]

Now, where was I? -- Oh, yeah. About ""TYAKUSIN ARI"" (a.k.a. ""One Missed Call""). For those of you who get irritated with my ""correct translation"" spiels, I can save you the grief this time around, since the translation of the original Japanese title is 'accurate enough' in this instance so that there's no real need for me to make an issue out of it: ""tyakusin ari"" (or ""chakushin ari"") is one of those phrases which has a little difficulty translating 'literally,' although the original thought is more closely aligned with the ""You've Got Mail"" alert you get from your AOL account (e.g. 'you received a call').

A lot of the typical A-Horror cliches play out in this movie (e.g. the ""long-haired"" female ghosts, the ""virus-like curse"" which spreads via modern communications technology, the 'detective work' tracing the sad/tragic origins of the grudge back to the angry/misunderstood ""victim"" who set the curse in motion, the confusing & almost completely indecipherable ending, etc.). But this one bumps everything up a few notches in its quickness of pace, its brutality and its -- weirdness. A couple of things are going to throw you off track towards the end, guaranteed -- but if you don't dwell on it for too long it shouldn't spoil the rest of the wild ride experience you were taken on up to that point. Also, don't be too quick to shrug the whole thing off due to these seemingly 'non-sequiturs' -- I can assure you that it is going to take AT LEAST three (3) full viewings before you can finally begin to see how everything fits into place (and even if you're still confused after that, don't let it bother you too much, just enjoy the head trip, because it's a fun one).",1126224000,15,3186,4.815018315018315
2354620,4,B000A2XA8M,"The original Japanese title for this movie is ""Chakushin Ari"" It's the first movie in a trilogy that was hugely popular in Japan. Thee is also a T.V series DVD based on just the first movie's events with different actors, some different characters, same story. Despite drawing comparisons to The Ring and ORIGINAL Ringu, the only thing they have in common is: a vengeful ghost and the use of cellphones. These types of stories are both common and popular in Japan in the same way that slasher flicks once were here and Saw/Hostel type of films currently are here as of the end of 2007. The best thing about this film is the terrifying ringtone that is the theme. The plot unfolds as people start receiving phone calls from their own cell phone numbers from a time and date in the future - about a week or so.. When you answer, you hear the last few seconds of your life. If you don't answer, you will get a voicemail or photo. Changing your number doesn't work, and if you throw away the phone, it mysteriously comes back anyways.
A US remake has a January 2008 release date. It is unknown as of now whether it will shame this movie like The Ring did with Ringu, but the previews make it seem likely. See the original version now!",1126137600,,1230,4.422907488986784
2354630,3,B000A2XA8M,I enjoy Miikes movies with all the different kinds he makes. This was a good movie to watch but it wasn't one of my favorite of Miike. I like to be suprised in horror films and it seemed kind of predictable.,1330300800,,207,4.073170731707317
2354631,3,B000A2XA8M,"The people who give this standard J-horror story high praises, are cult followers of the Director.  That's like saying all of Steven Kings movies are classics.  If you are giggly about one individual in the feature,  then your opinion of the Feature is jaded.  I thought The Ring was interestingly different. But it's popularity spawned many of its elements to be  Japanese copy-cated  to annoyance.  I hated the spinoffs of The Ring, because the horror element was unimaginatively the same. Japanese must be easily horrified by an asian girl with wet hair covering her face.  In this weak duplicate, a phone is the electronic connection to notify people of impending doom. Previous devices were a Camera, (Japanese fixations with their cameras),  and a VCR in another.  This feature lacks variety in scares. And, peoples names.  But then, these are the same creative folks who grew up thinking Godzilla, Mothra, and that dopey flying Turtle, with rocket exhaust shooting from it's feet as it flew through the sky, ...  were fantastic Creatures.  The Actresses need lesson on displaying Shock on their expression-lacking faces.  And, 2 hours of this nonsense, was much too long.  Also, the poor voice-over dubbing kills much of the atmosphere. In very poorly asian dubbed movies, all of the voices seem to be from 2 or 3 people doing all the voices. This isn't far from that experience.  Definately not a 15 dollar movie. Japan needs to come up with something New for Horror.  This theme is played-out.",1322697600,,1502,4.944

2354634,4,B000A2XA8M,"There have been plenty of Asian horror films that offered tons and tons of scares. Ju-on: The Grudge, Ringu, Shutter, Gin Gwai (The Eye), and others are sometimes incredibly effective. One Missed Call may not be in the same league, but it sure gives us a creepy feeling about our cellphones (the ""Ringtone of Death"" will certainly scare those who have not seen this film before). The story isn't very fresh, but it really does make for a very good horror flick. Ghosts and scary-looking girls/women will be seen a few times here. Blood and gore isn't very excessive, but jump scares are aplenty. The ending will certainly have people scratching their heads. I, for one, found it to be fairly confusing, but I guess it was meant to be ambiguous.

If you've seen Ringu or Gin Gwai, you'll probably like this one as well. It's not the absolute scariest, but it's still pretty scary.

2354638,2,B000A2XA8M,"I'm a big fan of director Takashi Miike, so it pains me to say that this is the first film of his that I found pretty damned disappointing. As prolific as Miike is, one would HAVE to forgive him an occasional misstep, but THIS film looks like it could've been made by any marginally talented director looking to milk a few screams from the Asian teenybopper market. Maybe I'm a bit jaded at the age of 48, but I didn't find it remotely scary or even all that creepy, and it really could've gotten away with a PG-13 rating. I suppose in this age in which everyone is so utterly obsessed with their cell phones, a film like this was inevitable and that's why it seems awfully contrived. I'm glad the American remake was so roundly castigated by critics.",1208390400,,751,4.410071942446043
2354639,4,B000A2XA8M,"Every time I hear that America is redoing any film I automatically know that I have to see the original first. I'm not hating on my own country but hey, they don't always get it right. So when I saw the preview for One Last Call I seriously thought that maybe this could quite possibly be one of the dumbest movies ever made. If you think about it the movie is like the little girl from ""The Ring"" has become lord of the cell phones. You can't lie and say that it doesn't sound like that but hey sometimes I'm wrong. I just happened by the original Japanese version and I was a bit curious.

The movie is about an evil spirit that has completely taken over cell phones. The victim gets a phone call with a weird ring tone that's completely different than the one they set. It turns out to be some creepy child's lullaby. Everybody in here seems to be smart cause none of them answer the phone but it doesn't last for long. A message is left and when they listen, they hear their deaths just a few days before it happens. Creepy right? But what makes it worse is the gruesome ways these people die.

A schoolgirl gets the call one day. On the day she is said to die, she is suddenly thrown into a train while talking to her friend. The spirit gets a hold of the numbers in her phone and now her friends are in danger. It seems that nothing can stop it from happening but a cop whose sister died after receiving the phone call is trying. He also has the help of the latest victims friend who has now been added to the list and only has a few days before she dies.

Takashi Miike (Addicted) directed this film, which gives a lot of confidence when you buy or rent this. He certainly did a great job with this one. I love that it was very dark and creepy, it also held a great mystery. After I saw the first 15 minutes I really wanted to keep watching just to see what the heck was going on. There were some cool shockers also, some crusty hands started rushing out of the darkness and I went crazy. The acting was extremely good, especially in the part when one of the young girls is waiting for her time to run out. She is terrified and knows that nothing good is coming. She was crying, breathing heavily, and shaking. She looked so real that I couldn't believe she was acting. To conclude ""One missed call"" had great suspense and nice pacing. It isn't a 5 star to me but it is definitely good enough to receive 4 stars. There weren't many flaws but I thought that the concept and execution were between 4 or 4 1/2 stars.",1203292800,3,2520,4.191752577319588
2354640,3,B000A2XA8M,"I'm writing this after watching the movie for the second time - I  watched it the first time a little over a year ago.  I thought it was pretty good right up until the last 10 minutes, which made little to no sense.  I'm not an idiot, and I've watched enough Japanese horror movies to know the endings too often make the viewer think or say WTF?, but it seemed like they couldn't decide on an ending and just threw multiple endings together at the last minute.
It's still worth watching, as it did have some creepy moments and well-done scenes (Miike is a fine director), but the poor ending took a lot away from the movie.",1199750400,,623,4.3076923076923075
2354641,5,B000A2XA8M,"I am thrilled to announce that Chakushin Ari (or One Missed Call) is a genuinely creepy film.  As a long-time horror fan, my zealous search for a film that will actually scare me is all but futile, but this film comes as close as any in a number of years.  No, it didn't actually scare me, but it did feature some really creepy moments.  I suggest you do as I did - wait until the middle of the night, turn off all your lights, and start this puppy up.  Chakushin Ari really is the creepiest Asian horror film I've seen up until now - and that is saying something.  I freakin' love this movie.  As I write this, Hollywood is about to release a remake of the original, and all I have to say is: who are they kidding?  There's no way Hollywood can produce anything as atmospheric and intense as this film - and whoever they cast in the lead role will have a hard time equaling the amazing performance of Kou Shibasaki.

The basic premise of the story is that people start receiving calls on their cell phones recording the moments of their deaths.  The phone calls come from each individual's own cell phone number, feature the same creepy ringtone, and are always dated a day or two in the future, thus revealing the exact time of each person's death.  Then, when each such death actually takes place, someone in the victim's list of saved phone numbers is automatically selected to be the next phone call recipient.  Yumi Nakamura (Kou Shibasaki) just so happens to be on the phone with Yoko Okazaki (Anna Nagata), the first call recipient, when she meets a most grisly end at the specified time.  She tries to warn the second victim but only succeeds in watching him meet his own unfortunate end, but in the process she definitely makes a believer out of her roommate Natsumi Konishi (Kazue Fukiishi), who just so happens to be the next selected victim.  The police, naturally, think Yumi is just hysterical over the sudden loss of two friends, but some folks from a TV station take the story and run with it.  They build a whole, live, ""will she die?"" broadcast around poor Natsumi, complete with scientific and paranormal experts and a medium tasked with keeping the girl safe.  This TV thing sounds pretty corny, but I loved the idea of it - and it certainly does make for some ""must see"" television.  I only wish we could have gotten some reactions from the news people after it was over.  Yumi finally finds an ally (and not a minute too soon) in Yamashita Hiroshi (Tsutsumi Shinichi), who blames his sister's death six months earlier on the ""ringtone of death"" phenomenon.  Their desperate search for an answer sets the stage for the creepiest moments of all and some serious twists and turns toward the end.

Yes, there's a certain ambiguity to the conclusion, but that doesn't bother me at all - especially since getting to that ending was so much fun.  It's also true that some facets of the story are a bit of a stretch and/or somewhat confusing.  Ever heard of suspension of disbelief?  Actually, this story makes more sense that some other Asian horror films I could name - and let me say that there is much more to the story than what I've mentioned in the context of this review.  Another criticism I hear is that the special effects mirror those of earlier films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringu</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ju-on-The-Grudge/dp/B00005JNJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ju-on (The Grudge)</a>.  Personally, I don't think this criticism is completely valid.  One of the many things that director Takashi Miike does exceptionally well is to limit the number and scope of the ghostly appearances up until the last few scenes of the movie.  From the subtle to the in-your-face manifestations, each appearance plays to maximum effect.  Miike also goes the extra mile to include some nice gory touches that this gorehound truly appreciated.

I think Chakushin Ari is an extraordinarily powerful horror film.  While it lacks (but not by much) the emotional intensity of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tale-of-Two-Sisters-Two-Discs/dp/B000FVQYY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tale of Two Sisters (Two-Discs)</a>&nbsp;and probably won't draw you in a quickly as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringu</a>, it delivers almost two full hours of creepy goodness.  If you were to come up to me right now and ask me to recommend a good Asian horror film, Chakushin Ari would be the first words out of my mouth.",1199059200,4,4715,5.248

2354643,3,B000A2XA8M,"One Missed Call (Takashi Miike, 2004)

Takashi Miike is one of the world's most prolific directors, a holdover from the V-Cinema years when he was directing four or five movies a year just to make ends meet; when his career as a serious filmmaker took off in the mid-nineties in Japan (and soon after overseas), the bills got paid easier, but the work ethic remained, and Miike has churned out a string of fantastic movies over the years; the beginning of his true genius, in my humblest of opinions, was Shinjuku Triad Society, ten years ago (as I write this), and it hasn't yet let up, despite the sheer magnitude of his offerings. That said, One Missed Call is perhaps the least Miike-like movie I've seen of his, and is probably the weakest he's released in this ten-year span, but a mediocre Miike release, like a mediocre Merzbow album, is usually still better than ninety-five percent of the movies you'll rent from that year.

One Missed Call is Miike's entry in the exceptionally popular subgenre of spooky-ghost-films that's been all the rage in Asia since Hideo Nakata scored big-big-big with Ring back in '98. The tale is kind of pedestrian; there's a ghost who kills people through their cell phones. Your phone rings (with a ringtone that isn't actually on your cell phone, an eerie kids' song that may be the best feature of the film), and when you pick up the voice mail, it's from you, sometime in the future, and is a recording of your last words. Much of the fun to be found in this flick comes from figuring out how it is that said words factor into the victim's usually absurd death. (Miike's trademark of absurd violence is reined way in here, but it does come out in places, which is a good thing.) It's a fun little flick, but a minor one, lacking the glorious excess and sense of unreality that usually pervades a Miike film; if you're new to the man's work, you might want to go for one of his superior, better-known films (Audition, Ichi the Killer, The Bird People in China, etc.) before picking this one up. ***",1180137600,,2040,4.5710382513661205

2354649,3,B000A2XA8M,"One Missed Call is Takeshi Miike's Ringu/Phone ripoff, and a surprisingly low-key and tasteful (by Miike's standards) one it is too. It's also too long and suffers from an ending that's a little ambiguous in the ""What's that all about, then?"" way, and it seems a little awkward to have a major plot point revolve around Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy now that the condition has been widely repudiated as the invention of a vindictive misogynist who gets his jollies from giving false evidence in cot death cases. The plot involves a vengeful spirit that finds its next victims from the memory of the latest victims mobile phones, sending them a message from the future offering their last words, and the plot developments are pretty much as you'd expect. There are minor frissons in the death scenes, and there's a neat setpiece where a live Geraldo Rivera style show centered on the next victim's last few minutes goes spectacularly pear shaped, but it's also overlong and the execution is often a little too clinical for the material.

Their connection to each other: Their cell phones. Directed by Takashi Miike, this film is above average, and enjoyable. [To me at least]. The film opens with a young girl receiving a phone messsage which is from the future. However, it's not good news she hears, but her own death. Eventually other friends receive the same type of messages that will eventually lead to their deaths. The angry spirit which is causing these deaths will not be stopped. The film is not original, but it is an entertaining film.

I really liked the part where the priest tries to quell the spirit on television [as word has spread far and wide about these bizarre occurrances, and a ratings programs shows viewers in Japan what is happening]. As the deadline for one of the film's character approaches, she and her friend try and uncover who the spirit is, and why she is trying to kill her and the others. The film has some pretty creepy scenes; and although it's not a great film, it's not bad either. As I wrote earlier, it is an appealing and enjoyable film. And since I like Japanese films, the film appealed to me. However, it may not appeal to other viewers. Therefore, I would suggest you rent it first.",1165190400,,1357,4.584362139917696
2354651,4,B000A2XA8M,"The telephone, with its sudden, loud intrusion into daily life, has always been a vehicle of horror and suspense, from Agnes Morehead's classic and chilling ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" to its role in ""Scream.""  In Japan, the mobile phone is as ubiquitous as shoes, and such a natural part of life that the idea of it becoming something to be feared is worse than the haunting itself.

In ""One missed call"" (""Chakushin Ari""), director Takashi Miike plays on this fear, combining traditional elements of Japanese ghost stories with modern technophobia in a way that has become a hallmark of modern Japanese horror films.  It starts with a girl getting a phone message, arriving from the future, and the message is the girl's own voice.  She hears her own death, and the countdown begins until that time in the future arrives.  And then another message, this time to a friends phone.  And then another.

While the plot is fairly standard, Miike is a good director who keeps up the suspense and puts in enough originality to make a good film. Several of the deaths are truly shocking, and, without giving anything away, not everything plays out the way it is expected.  The ending alone puts ""One missed call"" above the other glut of ""Ring"" imitations that have followed the wave of its popularity.  The problem, though, is that it is not a great film, and greatness is what we have come to expect from Miike.  When a standard is set by outrageous hard horror like ""Audition"" and ""Visitor Q,"" then a straight-forward horror film can be disappointing.  But not too disappointing, as it is still a scary flick and worth watching.  Just go into it expecting to watch a good ghost movie, and not a ""Miike movie.""

This is a nice DVD release, with extras including Behind the Scenes - Making Of, Deleted Scenes, and Interviews.  Hearing Miike talk about why he did a straight-forward J-Horror film, and what he wanted to bring to the genre and where he felt he succeeded and failed, is really interesting.

Without revealing any of the story, I will say that some background knowledge of Japanese supernatural traditions would probably clear up some of the confusing points of the film. Certain things are left unexplained, any more than an American film would explain why a vampire feared a wooden stake. It is just assumed that everyone watching the movie will already know this.",1158019200,9,2366,4.778869778869779

I wasn't to excited about it cause I recently watched Pulse and thought it was pretty dumb and very slow and not that scary (except for the couch scene which I almost had to fast forward it was damn tense and freaky).

But I was pleasently surprised with this rent. It actually kept my attention through the whole movie and didn't seem that slow at all. It definitely had some creepy moments also.

The plot was kinda quirky imo though. I mean... if you know the person that gets the phone call, then I would take my damn phone number out of their phone...and then call the phone company and have them delete my account and shut my phone off. There would be no way in hell someone could call me. But still...it's a movie. A horror movie at that. I'm not here for plot..i'm here for scares. And it worked on me.

What I didn't like about the movie:

1. The whole Black Haired creepy girl thing is so over used now. It's really sad to see directors constantly use rip this idea off. But what's really sad is..it's still scary..so they'll keep using it.

2. I didn't like our lead girl hugging that mom. That was just...wierd and eye rolling.

3. The ending left me saying ""wtf?"". The candy kiss was kinda hot though. But when she started laughing at the end...I just was left clueless.

Overall though...I really liked the movie. Now I'd like to rent part 2 (it was out). I heard it wasn't as good and the plot was really dumb...but hey..I'll be my own decision maker.

I still want to see Audition also, but my Blockbuster doesnt carry it. I might just have to break down and join Netflix.",1149379200,3,1766,4.362804878048781
2354654,3,B000A2XA8M,"Like many of you I'm a big fan of Asian horror movies, and hearing that One Missed Call is also directed by Takashi Miike I rushed to my video store and picked it up. This movie though is very different from a usual Takashi Miike movie, his movies are usually quirky (Happiness of Katakuris), intense (Ichii the killer), suspenseful (AUDITION, and just plain weird (GOZU). The thing I tried to keep in mind was that usually none of his movies are made the same way. So back to the movie itself, basically just take JU-ON, PHONE (from Korea), a dash of RINGU and you have One Missed Call. The only thing that was really different then most of the other Asian horror movies was probably the death scenes.

One scene a girl is basically twisted in a weird way and her head pops off, another girl falls onto a moving train and we see her severed arm dialing a number, etc. So this movie did have a little bit more gore to it then most of its previous. One my favorite things about the movie, that alright also made it different, instead of the phone calls effecting a few people it was something that the whole country of Japan was afraid of. There is even a part where they try to perform an exorcism on a girl to stop the ghost on national television. The movie also brings up issues of child abuse with the main character.

The movie is not very original with its script which I was a bit disappointed with. It was made very well. If you got to the special features select the interview with Takashi Miike and he even comments about how he didn't really get to make it the way he wanted to, and if he did it probably would have seemed more like &#8216;Visitor Q' or GOZU. Which would have been good for his fans, but he wanted to open up to a wider audience. This is also Takashi Miike's first attempt at mainstream J-Horror.",1146268800,3,1824,4.330409356725146
2354655,5,B000A2XA8M,"This movie is great!  It was scary and i love it.  The plot was good and it kept me guessing.  I have 2 predictions why i liked this movie:

1,  the director also made audition and is know for making gross movies with alot of blood and guts.  Although this movie didn't have much of that, gross things scare me so i was on edge thinking that something nasty was going to happen.

2. i cared about the characters.  In the Grudge, i didn't care if they died.  I was like: wtv if you die than i guess you won't be in the 2nd grudge.  but in this movie i wanted the characters to stay alive so when they came close to dying, i felt scared for them.

3. good dub.  the dub isn't great with the mouth movements but the voices themselves are good unlike ju-on which have silly anime sounding voices.

in all i say get this movie and enjot",1145750400,3,831,4.055555555555555
2354656,4,B000A2XA8M,"... because I had nightmares the rest of the evening. I actually woke up moaning in terror at one point. This is probably the scariest of all the J-Horror films I've seen so far, keeping in mind I have yet to see the original versions of The Ring and The Grudge. I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the indecypherable ending... but that didn't spoil the overall creepiness and terror of the film.",1141776000,4,401,4.36
2354657,2,B000A2XA8M,"This is the worst Asian movie that I have ever seen.  The story is dumb and doesn't make any sense, especially the ending.  And to top it off it isn't that scary - it only gets a little bit scary at the end.

My recommendation:  Don't get this movie.  It is also too expensive.  It you want to watch a good Asian horror movie, I have lots of recommendations.  Wishing Stairs is pretty good.  Koma is an excellent movie. A Tale of Two Sisters is pretty good. Good luck.",1140307200,,468,4.179775280898877
2354658,3,B000A2XA8M,"Let me begin with this review by stating that I enjoy most of the movies made by this director, Takashi Miike.  He is well known for his ability to shock the audiences with non-conventional plot devices and imagery .  His movies are typically marred with violence, destruction, and excesses.  Even more impressive, this guy makes something like 5 movies a year, every year for the last decade or so.

The reviewers before me have revealed enough plot about this movie so I will skip to my gut feelings after watching this movie.  To be honest, I am disappointed.  The plot felt too close to The Ring and while there was a twist at the end, for the most part the movie was predictable and full of cliches.  Miike did not lose his comedic touch with the exorcism scene, but overall this movie feel like it was forced.

One great thing about this DVD though, is the bonuses.  Unlike many other J-movies this DVD set actually comes with a 2nd disc full of interviews and an alternative ending.  I hardly understood the original ending so I actually enjoyed the 2nd ending a little more;  it was done in a typical Miike fashion.

Overall there are many better J-Horror movies out there as with better Miike movies.  For those who enjoy J-Horror definitely check out The Ring (not the American remake, although it was not bad) if you have not already.  Miike fans probably have already seen most of the movies this guy has made.  My personal favorites are Visitor Q, Dead & Alive, and Ichi the Killer.",1139702400,,1495,4.567669172932331
2354659,5,B000A2XA8M,"I recently purchased a bunch of J-Horror movies, since that seems to be the only horror flicks worth watching these days. This film was one I came across and decided to just give it a shot without realling looking into it like the others I had purchased like ""The Whispering Corridors"" triolgy, The Eye 1&2, and a few others. This was one of the first movies I watched out of the bunch. Well, I guess you could say I regret watching this one first. All the rest of the movies just have kind of gone downhill. I'm not trying to knock down the other classics like the ones I mentioned above, because they are still great movies worth watching, but none had the impact or suspense that this movie did. If you want a movie that has suspense written all over it, with a few jumps here and there, this is the one to get. It was the first movie since the Exorcist that had me creeped out.

The only negative thing I can say about this movie, is how it ends. Not only was I confused, but rather let down. The end reminded me of a rehash of another popular J-Horror flick... (I won't mention the name to ruin the movie)

Overall, I'd give it 4.5 stars... only due to the ending. But from what I had read after I've seen the movie, is this was a movie actually made poking fun at the Ring/Ju-On series, or so I've read. If thats true, and they are making a sequel, and they actually try, I'll definately put that one in my collection as well...",1128297600,6,1434,4.2299270072992705

8073475,3,B000A2XA8M,"One Missed Call follows Yumi and her friends as they are haunted by a mysterious voicemails that accurately predict their deaths. Of course, the story is a little deeper than that but I don't want to spoil the film.

The first half of One Missed Call was interesting but a bit on the slow side; most of the scares and truly chilling moments are in the second half and towards the end. It may feel similar to a lot of other foreign horror films because it doesn't really stray away from that formula; the scares are fun and effective, nonetheless. The storytelling wasn't great, I got lost a couple of times but enjoyed the ending since it really makes you think. By the end of the film, I felt like I was watching a completely different movie. Acting was great, and the music was chilling.

One Missed Call is scary and creepy, but it's not as original or innovative as it sounds or could've been. The voicemail concept wasn't used effectively, in my opinion, and almost feels like it was abandoned towards the end. I recommend it to fans of horror since it's still has some chilling moments and kills time.

One Missed Call has violence and gore, some brief nudity.",1350000000,,1166,4.516587677725118
8073476,2,B000A2XA8M,"This got a better review than the same American movie. I would not suggest this movie at all. It makes no sense even for a horror movie. I like some semblence of ""this could happen"" in my movies and this does not have it.  I fell asleep. I can't imagine how bad the American one is.
Spoiler Alert. the whole movie revolves around a phone call coming to one person after another and each dies. The result, a dead person is making the calls because her body was abandoned in an old defunct hospital. Not for nothing but IF she could dial these numbers and get a message across, why not just call one person and say ""I have been abandoned in this hospital please come and get my body"". Case closed.",1346630400,,695,4.265151515151516
8073477,4,B000A2XA8M,"This movie has many of the most frightening elements
that horror movies have to offer
and they are offered up by a masterful director
who truly knows how to create a motion picture experience.
I should qualify that by calling it mainstream horror;
and qualify it again by adding that it is primarily
intended for the youthful/teenage movie watcher.
Those qualifications do not necessarily make it a lesser movie.
Quite the contrary, it is compelling, interesting,
gross and scary and the work of an accomplished
film-maker with an reasonably good story to show and tell.
It may be a lesser movie for Miike fans
of the extremely grotesque and bizarre,
although there is plenty of grotesque and bizarre in this movie.
If this movie had been produced many years ago,
it would have been hailed as a masterpiece,
but we live in the age of ""What have you done for me lately?"".
It has atmosphere, creepy sounds, ghosts, undead, mystery,
murder from the beyond; all kinds of creepy goings-on.
It also has the theme, much loved by Asians,
of technological devices serving as a conduit for beings
from another reality to crossover into our own.
In this case the cell phone which is used to send
a message from yourself from the future:
a recording of your time of death which will be arranged
for you by some force from another dimension.
Trust me, this is one seriously troubled spirit.

If one enjoys scary ghost stories, this movie is recommended.

nb: the English dubbing is lame,
use the original Japanese with English subtitles.",1343433600,,1524,4.7908745247148286
