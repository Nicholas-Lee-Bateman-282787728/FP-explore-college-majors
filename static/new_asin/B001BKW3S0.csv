Aaron D. Spears plays Ali. He is slightly different from the rest of the gang. He is smart and just wants to do his time and get out. He is protected by the guards. A new white kid, Andrew Perryman (Garette Ratliff Henson) son of a rich man (Richard Lyonhart) has entered the Massachusetts Institute. The warden ( V.J. Foster ) is being paid $50,000 a month to keep his son from being harmed.

The warden ""leans"" on the Mannsfield 12 with a Black Betty to ensure he gets his money. The ""12"" are all in the east wing. They run things from there, including drugs and comfort girls. They get paid and the warden gets a kick-back. Perryman has started smoking crack and is paranoid, afraid of being raped by Monsta (Justice Smith). The ""12"" think the warden can do with less money now that he has a new income, however the warden gets greedy and demands 50% instead of the usual 10% to the dismay of Hunnit Grand (Tony Todd) the leader of group who runs things from his wheelchair. However things don't go as planned which is what makes this story interesting.

It is a good movie, but there are some plot weaknesses. Amazing how criminals suddenly become noble and honest in prison. The ending was not what I expected.

No real nudity, no real sex scenes, some blood, torture, f-bombs.",1342742400,,1444,4.462121212121212

8283447,5,B001BKW3S0,"Let's be honest, how many movies do you see that are made today that present the notion of friendship without it becoming corny and Disney like? There aren't many that immediately spring to mind, but after watching this it will stick in your head for years to follow. What makes it unique I hear you ask. Well, that's very simple, it's based in an American state penitentiary where violence and agression are ripe in the prison society. You don't see many movies set in an American prison that turn into ones that inspire and delight you into believing in the goodness of mankind.

The story is set in Mannsfield State Penitentiary which is a prison for hustlers and has a special wing for the best, that is the east wing. This was developed by the prison warden as a way of making a bit of extra cash from the best hustlers in the prison. Currently there are 12 residents but it's about to go to 13 as a new resident, Andrew Perryman who's the son of a very rich and powerful man is about to enter the wing. The warden is approached by Perrymans father with an offer of $50,000 dollars a month with the guarantee of his sons safety during his 18 month sentence.

Perryman doesn't take to prison life too well and immediately gets drawn into the criminal underworld by taking drugs and even looking to arm himself for protection. One fateful day a series of events disturb Perryman who rushes into his cell to arm himself, then is surprised by Officer Barron leading Perryman to turn around and stab Barron in a panic. The warden and one of the officers are the first to find out about the incident and strike a deal to cover it up to protect Perryman, and their financial interests. The situation is discovered by an inmate friend of Barrons called Ali, which leads to a tortorous situation which turns great enemies into the closest of friends.

Depending on how you look at this film will really depend on what you think of it. If you're expecting a clich gangbanging prison movie then you would be fatefully wrong. It does have the gangbangers and the hustlers but they are displayed in an entirely different light. The atmosphere is entirely different, it's much darker and considering the East Wing is meant to be the easier part of Mannsfield State it's shown to be much more of a difficult living arrangement than the possible open prison. There are a number of different story arcs to this. There is the pre-warden bribery life of the prisoners, the wardens struggle to cover up what he has done and the developing friendship of the once feuding prisoners.

The acting is something to really be spoken about in this as the prisoner personalities are portrayed spectacularly by some relatively unknown actors. On a more personal level, I had not heard of a single one of the actors featured so it was a real delight to go into the film with little to no expectations. The people that deserve a special mention are the Warden himself played by V.J. Foster, who's a man with a face of genuine despicability. He incites furious anger from the viewer with his evil and threatening manipulation techniques and yes, if I saw him in person I would feel compelled to hit him. Aaron D. Spears deserves another shout out as the character Ali, an ex-Muslim who was forced to denounce his faith in order to survive on the inside. Quite surprisingly this man becomes the morality and strength of the entire East Wing, that gets them through their difficult time.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who are or are not familiar or regular fans of prison movies. It's less of a prison movie and more a movie about friendship and the power of money in our society. Regularly throughout the film the warden refers to the prisoners as savages or animals, but I found the question running through my mind ""who are the real savages here?"" It's a spectacular film that all will enjoy, but of course it's not a family film, more a film you can sit and enjoy with your mates.",1232755200,,3971,4.571629213483146
8283448,3,B001BKW3S0,"Whilst the premise for ""The Mannsfield 12"" is fundamentally sound, the cast strong and the cinematography potently vibrant, in-your-face and artfully brutal, the movie itself suffers from being slow-paced, is marred by woefully weak dialog and is altogether in desperate need of some quite severe editing. (The first 20 minutes, for instance, is largely unnecessary and is recapped most effectively in about 90 seconds by one of the characters almost straight away.)

Tough, gritty and violent throughout, this film pulls no punches whatsoever in its portrayal of the essentially base nature of men, particularly those who have lost their way through material greed, positions of power and opportunism, forced to spend their days in the close proximity of others of their kind. (And I'm not talking about the life-sentence convicts who actually make up the twelve of the title.) Where the movie falls down though is in the pitifully poor lines which hamper all of the actors, severely damaging the credibility of their characters, together with the Craig Ross Jr's penchant for trying to make points by simply belabouring them to death, rather than developing tension through plot development, revelation and exposition. As the result, the viewer is frequently left bewildered and confused as to what is going on, or why. And on more than one occasion feels to have been on the receiving end of as brutal a beating as any of those portrayed on-screen.

All of which is a pity, because in the right editorial hands, this production could be a very potent and hard-hitting social commentary on the injustices of modern life, penal systems, racial stereotyping, etc. As it is, it feels instead like a missed opportunity, with the film-makers simply being gritty, violent and brutal just to show that they know how and aren't afraid of it.",1220227200,3,1835,5.093023255813954
