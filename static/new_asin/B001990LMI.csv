8278311,5,B001990LMI,I hope some DVD distributor will Put General Hospital on DVD. I know SoapNet will air a 50 hour marathon celebrating the 50th anniversary of the show. Unfortunately not everyone gets SoapNet. I hope they can put those episodes on DVD for fans!! I am sure many will buy a Special DVD set of General Hospital.,1363305600,9,307,4.5
