2386498,5,B000ADWCZ8,Thank you very much for the VHS version of the movie.  It was for a very special child who has only a VCR on his TV.  I had looked for this movie  for a long time and you came through.  Thanks again.,1202515200,,199,3.6666666666666665
2386499,5,B000ADWCZ8,"We love lazytown. I bought this DVD along with the CD soundtrack.
This DVD is a must see. Very colorful, high quality and fun. I can't find anything negative to say about this DVD. The songs are very catchy and everything about this DVD is just perfect. Buy it!",1188432000,,261,4.346938775510204
2386500,5,B000ADWCZ8,"My daughter is 4 years old and loves this show here in the UK.  She was desperate for her own DVD to watch so I bought this for her.  She absolutely loves it and sings to all the songs.  I think it's a great show for kids, even my 9 years old thinks it's great.  Their favourite character is Stephanie and mine is Robbie Rotten.  It has catchy tunes and even makes me laugh sometimes.

The only strange thing is that the voices are different in the UK.  My daughter was watching it and said that the television had gone wrong and that the voices of Ziggy, Trixie, Pixel and Stingy were odd.  Same thing happened on The Backyardigans.  Not that's it's stopped her from watching it 400 times.

Go buy it!",1140480000,,702,4.25
2386501,5,B000ADWCZ8,"This is the second DVD released with episodes from the popular show ""Lazytown"", with its leading human characters Sportacus (Magns Scheving), Stephanie (Julianna Rose Mauriello) and that adorable villain Robbie Rotten  (Stefn Karl Stefnsson).  A favorite with kids from the USA, UK and homeland Iceland, the popularity can be measured by the fact that ""Sportacus"" and ""Stephanie"" costumes have been sold out for months due to heavy demand.

Just ask the rapidly growing young audience about the benefits of sports candy, exercise and healthy habits and you'll begin to understand the positive influence exerted by this over-the-top, energy driven, annoyingly cheerful show.

This DVD has four episodes - the first being the Surprise Santa, where Robby almost gets a heart during the Christmas season; the second involving an alien and a space ship (which scared my four year old at first); the third about having good manners (and how not to walk in high heels), and the last about saving the town from earning the title of ""Laziest Town on Earth"".

Highly recommended for kids and aerobics fans everywhere.

2386502,5,B000ADWCZ8,"Surprise Santa is a great video featuring two episodes, including one for Christmas. Created by Icelandic aerobic champion and entrepeneur Magnus Scheving (who plays Sportacus), LazyTown is a show promoting healthy living and cooperation.

LazyTown's Surprise Santa - It's Christmas Day in LazyTown! To celebrate, the kids are having a holiday party. But Robbie Rotten believes he didn't get an invitation, and that leaves him feeling extra rotten. So Robbie disguises himself as Santa, with plans to ruin Christmas for everyone via a huge snowball! Robbie Rotten really steals the show in this episode, especially with his hilarious rendition of a song called ""Why It's Great to Be Bad"". (My husband and I laugh every time we see this episode!)

Ziggy's Alien - Robbie tries to scare the kids with his latest disguise, a space alien. Instead of being afraid, they befriend him and try to return him to his home planet--with Ziggy along for the ride!

This video is 51 minutes long and filled with the characteristic shenanigans of Robbie Rotten, heroism of Sportacus, and crazy adventures of townspeople like the Mayor, Pixel, Ziggy the sugar-holic, Stingy, etc. As always, Sportacus and the show LazyTown encourages healthy eating, exercise, and kindness--and features great up-tempo songs, too!

A very comical, witty video that's great for Christmas--or anytime!",1133913600,2,1366,5.28110599078341

Miss Roberta - Stephanie is throwing a party. But the last time she did so, the kids were wild! To avoid a repeat of their poor behavior, ""Miss Roberta"" offers to teach the kids manners. Something smells rotten here...

The Laziest Town - Accordig to the town's energy meter, the energy in town is down to zero. If things don't change fast, LazyTown will be named the laziest town on earth!

This DVD is 103 minutes long and filled with the characteristic shenanigans of Robbie Rotten, heroism of Sportacus, and crazy adventures of townspeople like the Mayor, Pixel, Ziggy the sugar-holic, Stingy, etc. As always, Sportacus and the show LazyTown encourages healthy eating, exercise, and kindness--and features great up-tempo songs, too!

2386504,5,B000ADWCZ8,"Magnus Scheving, creator of LazyTown, brings yet another exclusive DVD to the stores. This one deals with 2-exclusive episodes never before aired or seen (LazyTown's Surprise Santa; Ziggy's Alien), and also two bonus episodes (Miss Roberta; The Laziest Town) are on the disc as well. With the cast of Stephanie (Mauriello), Sportacus (Scheving), Robbie Rotten (Karl) and the rest of the cast of L.T., they bring more lessons and important info to the children, but also the adults. I love this show, and I hope that it continues to do as well as it is. Being one of the top shows in the world, who wouldn't want to watch.",1132185600,5,621,4.706422018348624
