1861931,3,B00008T286,"Sex Kittens Go to College is quite a mixed bag. After reading what a bomb this movie was, I actually thought the acting was for the most part pretty convincing; it was better than I expected. The choreography and cinematography work pretty well, too. The plot moves along nicely although they could have cut a minute here and there to tighten it up just a little. In addition, the musical score enhances the film.

Now I'll mention some other things. The plot is razor thin and purely intended to show off Mamie Van Doren and the others--but primarily Mamie Van Doren. Don't get me wrong; she does a pretty good job of acting, dancing the Charleston, shooting off guns to introduce herself to the class and more. There are cartoon-like sound effects and we're supposed to believe that Dr. Mathilda West (Mamie Van Doren), the new head of the science department at Collins College, actually has a chimpanzee in silly clothing using his toes to write a book using a typewriter--that is, when he's not playing the drums. Of course, the men, including Martin Milner as George Barton and Norman Grabowski as Woo Woo Grabowski, all over campus, are drooling over Dr. West while the women including Dr. Carter (Pamela Mason) become rather jealous of her because of her incredible good looks; Dr. Carter feels upstaged by Dr. West's thirteen degrees as well! Add to this two bumbling would-be hit men who believe that the campus robot that chose Dr. West, Thinko, is a human mobster who may have to be killed and you get quite a storyline.

And what might happen if anyone discovered that Dr. West has a past she is trying to cover-up? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

True, this is mindless entertainment but that has its value as well! Look also for Tuesday Weld as Jody; Brigitte Bardot's sister Mijanou as Suzanne who has a remarkably thick French accent; Mickey Shaughnessy as Boomie; Louis Nye as Dr. Zorch; Jackie Coogan as Admiral Wildcat MacPherson; John Carradine as Professor Watts; Vampira as Etta Toodie; Allan Drake as Legs Raffertino; Irwin Berke as Professor Towers; Charles Chaplin Jr. as a fire chief and Harold Lloyd Jr. as a cop.

Sex Kitten Go to College is good for fans of the actors in it and people who like campy films might want to get this, too.",1371945600,2,2271,4.698492462311558
1861932,4,B00008T286,"Miss Van Doren stars as a new science professor at a small college with Martin Milner as the dean who decides to check up on her backround. He finds out she is really Tassles Montclair, a former stripper hiding out from gangsters to exhibit her IQ in a new career where she nurses the troubled psyches of football player WuWu Grabalski and the campus computer Sam Thinko. The film just oozes with comic bits from Louie Nye, Brigette Bardot's sister (she has French subtitles when she talks) the monkey from Bedtime for Bonzo, and the always lovely Tuesday Weld as Wu Wu's jealous girl friend.",1254873600,7,592,4.647619047619048

7986808,4,B00008T286,This is a funny movie although a little strange. I have no idea why the women where dancing partially clothed in front of the robot. Mamie Van Doren and Martin Milner are charming!,1462752000,,180,4.484848484848484
7986809,1,B00008T286,Terrible movie. The only reason to watch it is to appreciate the ancient strippers or to gawk at what was left of Westinghouse's proud Elektro robot.,1452729600,,149,4.769230769230769

7986811,3,B00008T286,"Very silly - quite disjointed but harmless fun.  The nude striptease scene was out of character for the film and took away some of its charm.  Whereas Brigitte Bardot was a superb comic actress, her younger sister is not in the same league but she actually was well cast in this film.",1431561600,,284,4.4423076923076925

No damage",1422748800,,31,5.4
7986813,5,B00008T286,"This black and white Albert Zugsmith/Allied Artists film is high camp at its best. The plot is rediculous and the acting and script are absurd. But, that is what this comedy is suppose to be! The cast includes many great actors and actresses. The comedy here works because the film is top notch in its genre. Mamie Van Doren and Martin Milner (who co-produced) are wonderful in this film. The late Vampira even shows up for a brief stint. This is high camp sixties comedy at its best. This international expanded version includes some topless striptease artists just past the middle of the film. Who cares? Thanks to Time-Warner Video for finally making this film available. It would be great to see all of Mamie Van Doren's movies in DVD release. Hint. Hint. Mamie looks and sounds great and really makes this film almost believable at times. This is a must have for all Mamie Van Doren fans!!!",1406073600,2,895,4.670886075949367
7986814,5,B00008T286,"A great moment, this movie must be watched figuratively, on second or third (more) degree... Great casting for all B-movie fans : Mamie van Doren, Tuesday Weld, Mijanou Bardot (Brigitte's sister),  Pamela Mason (the ex James' wife), Vampira... and the robot, the chimp...  Concerning the plot... well... do we really need any ? The copy sound and transfert are fairly good. So just enjoy !",1396224000,,389,4.969230769230769
7986815,5,B00008T286,"1960 saw Sex Kittens Go To College a good natured sex comedy released starring the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren. The double entendres and innuendos fly thick and fast. She does a sexy Charleston, and Tango, along with a wild bump and grind, and sings one  number. You can see why Mamie was the Queen of the B-Films. The plot involves a stripper becoming a professor at a college. Some  nudity, [not Mamie], is shown. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. And I admire her stand for women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars from the Golden age of Hollywood.",1392336000,4,588,4.288288288288288
7986816,5,B00008T286,"At Comic Con in July of 2013, Warner Archives honcho George Feltenstein announced that Warner Archives is remastering this film for homevideo release in the fall of 2013.  The version coming from Warner Archives will contain about six minutes of nudie footage that was intended for European theatrical showings.  The release from Warner Archives is now scheduled to street on September 17, 2013, directly from the Archives.

UPDATE: It has arrived, and the letterboxed transfer from Warner Archives does feature the nearly ten minutes of topless footage.  It's not the film's stars who are topless, mind you, but three or four exotic dancers who parade their charms in front of Thinko the robot.",1374969600,,695,5.123893805309734
