8169733,5,B000MLBXRQ,"This 5 rating is for the seller(s). The quality of the picture was pretty bad. It was as if 'Desert Island' classics just burned a VHS recording onto the disc. And not a real good copy at that. Thankfully X-Box 360 has user friendly, as well as great options. Being able to make full screen out of a 4:3 ratio by choosing 'letterbox'. Asside from that, the seller of the DVD was very professional and helpful.",1519862400,,409,4.394736842105263
8169734,1,B000MLBXRQ,The movie isn't the greatest slasher flick as it is but that I knew. The quality of this transfer was the worst i've seen ever done. It looks like it was transferred from VHS to DVD and done very unprofessionally. Half the film the screen is cut in half and the audio quality was very poor. This was not what I was expecting for the $20 I paid for this movie. They could have done a much better job.,1375142400,,399,4.063291139240507
8169735,4,B000MLBXRQ,"In CLASS REUNION MASSACRE (aka: THE REDEEMER: SON OF SATAN), a maniacal preacher is stalking and killing those he deems worthy of death. Those on his hit list have gathered for their high school reunion. They soon realize that they are the only arrivals, and someone is preventing their escape. Of course, in the eyes of the crazed clergyman, these old classmates are sinners, and must be shown the err of their ways w/ extreme prejudice. Well, I admit that based on the characters' personalities, I mostly sided w/ the murderous preacher! He's actually pretty interesting, using various disguises, while orchestrating his victims' doom. One by one, the captives are picked off in inventive, horrible ways. As 70s / 80s slashers go, CRM is fun, if a bit goofy...",1364083200,,762,4.9147286821705425

8169737,3,B000MLBXRQ,"Lately the old boy Sid has been getting into some more obscure lesser viewed 80's slasher flicks with much enjoyment. Sure if you payed for them it wouldn't be worth it, however if you can get a free watch then it's certainly worth it. To enjoy flicks of this caliber you must go into it with the right expectations. Especially for certain obsessed Friday the 13th fanatics who take angry aim at many slasher films from the same period. Sure most won't compete with Jason and his antics but they're equally enjoyable on more of a b spectrum. This is obviously something Sid lives for.

Class Reunion Massacre is another slasher flick but actually has a somewhat more original storyline. Obviously from the title this one take place at a class reunion where six former popular students show up for their 10 year. What of crew of tool bags. From the first moments you get a taste of each one you just wait for the lopping to start. The thing strange about this reunion is their the only six to show up. They soon learn they've been locked inside as a killer takes them out one by one. The killer just happens to be a crazed preacher who wants to finish them for their wicked ways. He sent them invitations and set up a fake reunion just to so he could take them out. Wouldn't want to attend that guys church service.

For Sid this one was enjoyable enough to earn it a 3 star rating or 3 cans of which for sentimental value. It would have been way better if we had a little chuck to spice it up being that there were plenty of strange scenes with creepy music involved. Unfortunately half of Sid was elsewhere so it just wasn't possible at that moment. From a individually sober state the film did it's job for what was expected. By most it probably wouldn't be enjoyed due to it's ultra low budget but for those like Sid it should be a fun watch. This one would have been enjoyed by a young Sid since it was horror, not loved, but enjoyed.",1254182400,2,1938,4.350828729281768
8169738,3,B000MLBXRQ,"Okay, so 3 stars for this low-budget, grade-Z schlock known as both ""Class Reunion Massacre"" and ""The Redeemer""? I say why not? It's an extra cheesy 80's slasher, which tried to be more. ""Class"" starts out in what looks like a flooded rock quarry where some kid with a bad 70's haircut and a groovy pair of maroon cords emerges from the lake, why, who is he you might ask, we don't know and never will. All we know is that he has an extra Thumb and doesn't like off color jokes. From here the story jumps to a preacher laying down the fire and brimstone while this extra-thumbed kid sits in the choir. We are then introduced to the victims who all represent a sin, and all of whom happen to be part of the same graduating class about to return to their 10 year high school reunion. The death scenes are goofy, the gore given a bright red paint tinge which is unconvincing. There is some half-hearted attempt to make the killer different and not just your average psycho offing folks randomly. And this is where my 3 star rating comes in. This psycho is played by one of the most hammy and overacting dinner theater graduate to ever grace the screen. T.G. Finkbinder is AWESOME. Whether he is dressed up a murderous clown, dressed as Death or even Dressed as a knock off of the Phantom of the Opera quoting Shakespeare, Finkbinder steals every scene he is in! Is this movie scary? No. Is it gory? Not really? Is it basically the exact same film as ""Slaughter High""? Yes. But while ""Class Reunion Massacre"" does not feature the effects, budget or gore factor as ""Slaughter High"", it does have, the MAN----T.G. Finkbinder.",1180483200,3,1619,4.491525423728813
