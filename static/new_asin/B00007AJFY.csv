1803868,5,B00007AJFY,"Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this story of greed and sibling rivalry over Texas territory is astounding and an attention grabber from beginning to end ! There is plenty of treachery and deceit as well for good measure. Performance by Patrick Stewart of television's Star Trek Next Generation fame is a marvel in itself as the powerful and proud John Lear, land and cattle owner of Texas. Lear bestows upon his daughters the entire Texas empire. However, the land distributed amongst them is not enough;more is never enough ! The daughters' true plan of treacherous scheming begins to unfold to the very end with a gut wrenching climax !Honorable mention to actress Marcia Gay Harden for cruel, cold, and just downright nasty performance as the cattle baron's eldest and possibly most evil daughter ! Comedian/actor David Alan Grier turns in a fine and sarcastically witty portrayal as Lear's sort of ""court jester"" who counterbalances the dramatic nature of the movie. Though based on Shakespeare's King Lear the story itself feels like an authentic part of early American history on how the West was won...King of Texas was originally a TNT made for t.v. movie. However, it is definitely worthy of owning on dvd format.",1042934400,,1225,5.009803921568627
1803869,5,B00007AJFY,"This is solid proof that great story and great characters are timeless.
Like Julie Traynor's ""TITUS"", Baz Lurhman's ""ROMEO & JULIET"", and Richard Loncraine's ""RICHARD III"", ""KING OF TEXAS"" shows how The Bard's solid plots and characters work in any number of settings.
Here, the tragic masterpiece, King Lear, translates seamlessly to a Western setting.
Even the political situation at that time between Mexico and the US (just post-Alamo) fits like a glove with this story originally written hundreds of years ago. Amazing.
(For another great Twist on Lear, seek out Kurasawa's ""RAN"". He turns this story of an aging king into a fantastic Samurai epic!)
King of Texas, originally broadcast as a TNT movie, stars a long-haired Patrick Stewart magnificently leading a superb cast in a very authentic feeling Western.
Shakespear and Western fans alike should be swept away by this expansive and epic story...even if they don't have a taste for the other genre!
Don't miss this one just because it was a TV movie. It beats hell out of a lot of theatrical releases.",1035590400,7,1061,5.0
1803908,5,B00007AJFY,Great adaption of King Lear! This is easy to understand for those that have problem understanding Shakespeare's English. This would be great to show in a middle or high school class.,1386547200,,182,4.903225806451613

1803911,4,B00007AJFY,"You must know by now that I love Patrick Stewart. But I tried to watch a DVD of his ""King Lear"" and simply could not follow it. So, thoughtful guy that he is, he adapted it into a western that is way easier to follow.

The scene is Texas during its brief independence. John Lear (Patrick Stewart) is an aging cattle baron who decides that since his son died, he's going to divide up his lands among his three daughters. His eldest daughter, Susanna, is married to Mr. Tumlinson (Colm Meaney), and is greedy and vicious. The middle daughter is Rebecca Highsmith, more squeamish than her elder sister but goes along with what Susanna wants. The youngest, Claudia, has been taking care of her father since her sisters married.

It doesn't take long to discover that Lear is pretty far around the bend. As he discusses the map of his holdings, he tells each daughter she must tell him how much she loves him. Susanna is effusive, and is given the portion of land on which the ranch house sits. Rebecca also speaks highly of her father and is given the portion in the center of the spread. But when Claudia is told she must speak of her love for her father, she says he knows she loves him, she's been taking care of him all this time, and it does not seem right to have their inheritance depend on such expressions. She is convinced that her sisters were insincere, which is true. In a fit of rage, he tosses Claudia out of the house.

Claudia goes to her lover, who is a Spanish rancher who has the protection of Sam Huston, who made Lear promise he would never challenge Menchaca (Steven Bauer) for possession of the land. But while Lear is away, his two greedy daughters and one greedy son-in-law plot with others in the area to gather a mob and go attack Menchaca's castle -- er, hacienda.

Since this is a Shakespearean story at heart, a lot of people die. Yes, it is a tragedy. But the glory of the whole thing is Patrick Stewart first, and the marvelous landscape second. I can't really say how closely it follows the story line of the original ""King Lear,"" but I may take another try at following that now that I have this for reference. It would be fun to see how close it stayed.",1336694400,,2185,4.387654320987655
1803912,4,B00007AJFY,I greatly enjoyed this DVD. Patrick Stewart was as usual excellent in this adaptation of a centuries old classic. I would recommend this to all.,1283212800,,144,4.8
1803913,4,B00007AJFY,"Writing Shakespeare as in Texas before it was a state and the west was really wild.
The result is inspired and the acting is first rate.
Kids who would never go to King Lear
might actually sit through this one
and might even get the point?
The staging seems pretty authentic down to the weapons being used.
You really feel for the guy who the daughters put his eyes
with a red hot poker.
I loved it as I love both westerns and Shakespeare.",1258416000,,439,4.238095238095238
1803914,4,B00007AJFY,Wonderful adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear. Excellent performances by terrific cast. Great way to view this Shakespeare classic for modern audiences. Recommend it for high school students who are reading King Lear.,1223942400,,219,5.875
1803915,5,B00007AJFY,"This is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Lear-New-Folger-Library-Shakespeare/dp/074348276X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Lear (New Folger Library Shakespeare)</a>.  I read LEAR in college and the basic storyline is fairly close to the play.  Almost none of the lines out of the play are used, however.  It would not have worked that way as the film takes place in 19th century Texas.  It would have been anachronistic for the personas in the play to recite Shakespeare out on a Texas ranch.

To portray the story in this way was an interesting idea.  It actually ""works"" as Texas was largely lawless in the 19th century (they didn't call it the ""Wild Wild West"" for nothing!).  In a way, the owner of a major cattle ranch could be comparable to an English King during the middle ages.  The parallels w/the conflicts over land are believable.

At heart, however, LEAR has always been a story about the repercussions of growing old.  We all want to be cared for by our children.  The question is, what if they don't want to have anything to do w/us?  What if our children turn out to be self-serving, insidious characters?  What if they could care less about our-well being, and only want to serve their own avarice?  These troubling questions are taken up in this tragedy.

The film features an impressive ensemble cast that includes Patrick Stewart (as John Lear, standing in for King Lear), Roy Scheider, Lauren Holly, Colm Meaney and Patrick Bergin.  It's a well-done movie and perhaps makes the story slightly more ""accessible"" to Americans than if they had done a version of the original.  If you like Shakespeare (and we all should!), then this one belongs on your DVD shelf at home.",1197849600,,1784,5.181818181818182
1803916,5,B00007AJFY,Pretty much everyone else has said everything I wanted to say. This is a very well done adaptation of King Lear. I highly recommend watching this movie.,1190332800,,152,4.666666666666667
1803936,4,B00007AJFY,"It's based on Shakespeare's King Lear except it's in the 1800s in Texas. Patrick Stewart is John Lear, owner of a 200,000 acres ranch. He has three daughters and he wants to give each of them land but first they must tell him how much they love him. Two of the daughters hate him, especially the oldest, but lie to get his property. Once it's theirs, they let him know their real feelings toward him and also try to takeover their neighbors land.

I never read King Lear but it sure made a darn fine western! Good acting and great plot. Of course it's a great plot, it's Shakespeare! And Patrick Stewart was wonderful but he was trained to play Shakespeare. This is another movie that will please all kinds of people.",1154995200,,717,4.431818181818182
1803937,5,B00007AJFY,"KING OF TEXAS is based on Shakespeare's KING LEAR.  Not being knowledgeable of Shakespeare's play, I'm not sure how faithful the adaptation is, but one thing's for sure:  it plays like a true tragedy with some vile characters.  Patrick Stewart who also co-produced with his missus plays John Lear, the patriarch who has decided to divide his vast empire between his three daughters, only one of them he disowns because she doesn't answer a question he posits to them all:  why do you love Me?  This sets up a tragic series of consequences certainly evident in most of Shakespeare's tragedies:  greed, jealousy, murder, revenge.  The results are surprisingly good.  Stewart is top notch and he gets tremendous support:  Roy Scheider has his rancher friend has his best role in years; Marcia Gay Harden is stunning as the most vile of the daughters; Lauren Holly comes in second with her self-centered demeanor; and Julie Cox, the disowned daughter, is the soft and gentle daughter who is really the only one who loves her papa; Matt Letscher is a two-faced son of Scheider's; Liam Waite is the misunderstood brother; Steven Bauer is the Mexican whose land the girls want to take over; Colm Meaney is Harden's upstanding husband; and David Alan Grier is superb as Stewart's loyal ""slave"" and friend.  KING OF TEXAS is an excellent made for TNT movie and quite different.",1136592000,2,1368,4.883116883116883
1803938,5,B00007AJFY,"If the immortal Bard could only have imagined the adaptations that his work would inspire!  There have been numerous modernizations of Shakespeare's work.  From WEST SIDE STORY to TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU.  There have also been various different stagings for practically all of Shakespeare's stories.  So why not a Western?

We get just that in KING OF TEXAS, King Lear set in post-Alamo Texas. The story adaptations flows marvelously with Patrick Stewart starring as John Lear, a Texas patriot turned cattle baron. As with the Shakespeare original, Lear here has built an empire, complete with the pride and ego that attend it. He determines to leave his massive ranch to his daughters, Susannah (Academy Award winner, Marcia Gay Harden), Rebecca (Lauren Holly) and Claudia (Julie Cox). In a show of pseudo-love, the two older daughters charm the aging Lear, get the ranch for themselves and set in motion a chain reaction of drama and tragedy that Old William would have heartily approved of.

Some wonderful twists in the story include the part of the fool from the original play becoming a faithful black servant, Rip, played wonderfully by David Alan Grier (JUMANJI, RETURN TO ME). Keeping with the timeframe involved, it's the only natural solution. His playful banter with John Lear is wonderful and warmly draws the audience in.

The movie's depiction of the tense interplay between the Republic of Texas and Mexico is also a terrific twist as, historically, these two opponents continued to spar with each other for decades following the events that led to Texas independence.

One minor disappointment for me was the resolution of the original relationship of the two brothers, Edmund and Edgar, replaced in the Western drama with Emmett (Matt Letscher) and Thomas (Liam Waite) Westover.  Just as in the original play, the scheming and corrupt Emmett works to disinherit his brother, Thomas, the rightful heir. When their father, Henry (Roy Scheider) continues his allegiance to Claudia and goes to warn her of pending trouble, he is blinded (just as with Gloucester in the original play).  But in the original play the faithful son returns incognito and plays his father's servant, working carefully back into his father's good graces while waiting for the chance to avenge himself on his brother. Still in disguise, he then confronts his brother in a classic Shakespearean standoff. For the sake of not giving the story away here, let's just say it doesn't happen quite that way in this version.

I also very much missed a corresponding character in KING OF TEXAS for King Lear's faithful friend and advisor, Kent.

But, as mentioned, these are very minor issues at the very worst.

This is a classic Western with all the drama of its roots in Shakespeare with the spectacular setting of Texan grandeur. Not one that you will want to miss.

1803939,4,B00007AJFY,"Those of you who enjoy those good old western movies, but are needing a bit of Shakespearean drama, then King of Texas is the movie you want to see.  This movie is William Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" transplanted into a beautiful Texas setting.  The major characters found within ""King Lear"" have been renamed and wonderfully refitted for a classic made for TV  western movie.  Besides a few minuet  modifications to the story line, King of Texas is a close representation for ""King Lear"".  I found this movie to be very entertaining. Patric Stewart delivers an excellent performance, and he doesn't look that bad with a beard.  However, I did expect him to whip out a laser gun and kick [rear]... near the climax.  Unfortunately, these hopes never came true, but Patric Stewart is the man none the less.  This movie is a very nice change of pace of the average made for TV movie.  It is very well made with a superb cast, and more importantly the plot stays true to Shakespeare's ""King Lear"".  I would defiantly encourage anyone to watch King of Texas which is quite possibly one of the ton five made for TV movies of the year.  So if you like Shakespearean plays and the old west, you will love King of Texas.",1044316800,,1209,4.572093023255814
1803940,4,B00007AJFY,"In the movie King of Texas we are introduced to a new side of Shakespeare, the western Shakespeare.  This movie is a fine film and a good resource for those who have already read King Lear, which this movie is based after.  Having read King Lear, I noticed how acurate this movie was.  There were name changes and a differnt ending but over all it's an entertaining show.  The one complaint I have is the way King Lear is protrayed.  He is protrayed as angry and impatient in the movie, while in the play he was kinder to his daughters.  Also, I would change the ending, I didn't like how Rebecca wasn't killed by her sister.  I thought that her death by Gonreil was an important part which showed how heartless she was.  This movie will help anyone who didn't quite understand the play.  It could be used as a study guide because of how well it follows the play.  I recommend this movie to anyone ready for a hoot-hollering good time with a poetic twist.",1043625600,,955,4.375
1803941,4,B00007AJFY,"The ""The King of Texas"" takes the classic Shakespeare tragedy King Lear, and places it in the heart of Texas. The story takes place after the attack on the Alamo, and tensions between western settlers and the Mexicans are running high. This situation creates a perfect setting for King Lear. Lear is portrayed as a successful rancher. Although he does not have the title of king, he has enough power and influence over the territory to make him a king in his own right. The French, who in the play take in Lear's daughter after she has been turned away, have been replaced by Mexican settlers, enemies of the Lear family.
 All in all, I thought this version of the story remained true to the play and did not stray to far from the original plot. The language was easier to understand, rather than the old English of Shakespeare's time. By seeing the story retold, I found I was actually able to pick up on ideas and feelings which I had previously not understood. I think that for anyone hoping to better understand the play King Lear, the ""King of Texas"" is an excellent option.",1043539200,,1079,4.533333333333333
1803942,4,B00007AJFY,"""Shakespeare"" and ""western"" are words not often used in the same sentence, but Shakespear's ""King Lear"" actually makes a pretty good western.  ""King of Texas"" is a freash retelling of the old play.  John Lear is a wealthy and very powerful cattle rancher who, at the time of his retirment, divides his land between his dughters.  Just as in the play, two of his daughters turn on him and trow him out into the wilderness accompanied by his slave.  All characters of the play seemed acounted for except Kent.  Lear's slave had qualities of both Kent and the Fool.  He represents the comic relief of the move as the Fool did in the play.  The movie follows the play very faithfully; there were only a few disputes toward the end.  After reading the play I was somewhat confused about how everything took place.  Watching the movie helped make clear the chacters and events of the play.  It gave more background and depth to the characters, especially the daughters.  The transition to a western setting was done very well.  I could relate more with caracters placed in a setting more familure than old Britain.  The acting and directing was good, and even though its a TNT made-for-T.V. movie, it's very polished.  Because this isn't your normal western, I'd recomend this to everyone. (Even those who don't like westerns)",1043539200,,1320,4.757709251101321
1803943,4,B00007AJFY,"I thought that the move great, it was close to the play King Lear. Watching the characters was a lot of help in understanding them in the play. It was hard to understand the characters while reading the play. The movie helped me see them and put them all together.  The characters in the movie King of Texas were a lot like how I pictured them in the play King Lear. The movie goes along with the play, but I think they summed up the movie way to fast. They should have explained things more toward the end. Some of the things the characters in the movie do don't make sense. The things they do in the movie are fine except a couple of things that they do. For example, when they leave the room during the battle.  The characters were good and I thought they played their parts well. So in the end I thought the movie was good and that it was a good remix on King Lear. The fact that they were on a cattle ranch was interesting because they used the different ranches for the different kingdoms. I thought the play and movie went together really well. The characters played the parts, had the same ideas, and ended up the same as in King Lear.",1043366400,,1143,4.2146118721461185
1803944,1,B00007AJFY,"To start, I must say that even for a Shakespearean play, King Lear was very dry and boring to me. For this reason, I could not appreciate this movie. However, King of Texas is a mostly accurate portrayal of the tragedy King Lear, and it is well-done in that respect. I'm sure Uli Edel had quite a strenuous time directing such a complex Shakespeare play, and he succeeded in bringing the story to life in a way anyone could relate to.
 If you have not read King Lear, I would definitely not recommend watching this film. Seen only as a typical movie, this film would bore even the most attentive audience. The character of John Lear, played by Patrick Stewart, is very unbelievable and too melodramatic. I don't know whose idea it was to cast a Brit as a western cattle-baron, but the combination just doesn't work out. The same goes for Lear's three daughters: excellent portrayal of individual attitudes, but ruined by faked accents. I must admit that various other characters such as Westover (Gloucester), Rip (Kent and the Fool), and Thomas (Edgar) gave very interesting performances that lined up with Shakespeare's play almost to the line, and did it with convincing accents.
 Altogether, I will say that I enjoyed seeing the movie, but only after I had thoroughly read King Lear. Without this added boon, one can't expect to enjoy this movie or benefit by watching it. However, anyone who is confused by Shakespeare's old English style will certainly appreciate the modern approach given in the movie. Overall, this movie deserves a 4 out of 5 for Shakespeare buffs, but only a 1 out of 5 for the rest of us.",1043280000,2,1616,4.706713780918728
1803945,3,B00007AJFY,"In the movie King of Texas Patrick Stewart plays the part of John Lear, a Texas ranch owner who owns most of Texas. This movie is a very different version of Shakespeare compared to most renditions you might see in your life time. John Lear is so similar to the character of King Lear in William Shakespeare's play King Lear. The only exception is the accent in which they speak through out this movie. The southern accent and the modern way of talking eliminate some of the confusion that most people have when they read the play King Lear. I didn't appreciate this movie as much as I thought I would. The director had a different style of editing and completely off the wall way of depicting the situations for this movie. I felt that Shakespeare of all things should not be a western after watching this movie. Patrick Stewart shouldn't have acted the part in this movie and wasn't meant to act with a southern accent. The movie followed the King Lear play almost exactly and was the most accurate movie for the play that I've seen. I would recommend this movie for those interested in seeing a King Lear interpretation that is close to the play.",1043280000,2,1149,4.528846153846154
1803976,4,B00007AJFY,"The made-for-TV movie King of Texas provides a parallel story to the Shakespearean play, King Lear.  Both tales are about loyalty and betrayal, love and heartbreak, humor and sympathy.  The tyrant character of King Lear is portrayed by Patrick Stewart in a post-Alamo Texas setting.  The two stories carry the same basic plot, but each has its own special twist on the theme.  The theme happens to be to think of what you do before it comes back to haunt you.  The characters who falter on this moral topic end up losing something near and dear to their existence, such as their pride or family.  King of Texas made me laugh when Lear is insulted by his servant.  The servant represents the Fool character of the play.  It made me sympathize with Lear when he fell off his horse.  At this point, he has lost not only the love of his daughters, the home he lived in, and all of his property, but he has lost his dignity as well.  This quality, along with his pride, made Lear who he was.  The movie really allows its audience to feel with the characters. Although it is not a very good study tool for those reading Shakespeare's original, the movie is a fun idea as a follow-up.",1043280000,,1177,4.427906976744186
1803977,2,B00007AJFY,"The story line followed closely with the concept of King Lear. The adaptation from a B.C. English setting into a more recent, western setting, was portrayed well.  That is a very difficult transition and the setting worked.  It wasn't the best western movie, but the story line from King Lear was transformed the best way it could be.
Overall the plot followed Shakespeare's play the best it could have, with the new setting in mind. The storm scene was very closely related to the storm in Act III scene ii of King Lear.  John Lear was portrayed closely to King Lear, the emotions were there; and the viewer could really feel for him. The situation his daughters put him in was unbearable for a man of his caliber. The Shakespearian version portrayed Lear as a crazy man, while in the movie I felt Lear suffered from dementia. Lear's character showed a weakness-- a great and powerful man who feels that there is nothing that can bring him down, nothing that can knock him out of his saddle, but in truth is due to age and his sickness his daughters see a ... in his armor, much like when he falls off his horse in the storm, and take advantage of the moment.
The only disappointment in Lear was that he was more stubborn than proud in the movie.  The two oldest daughters disappointed me, compared to the play; their characters were not harsh enough.  Goneril and Regan were bitter and wicked, compared to the daughters in the movie who despite what they did to there father still felt sympathy for him.
I felt the movie was closely related to the originated play, and worked with what it had to show the weakened Lear, and which characters truly loved him and not his wealth and power.",1043280000,2,1688,4.521311475409836
1803978,4,B00007AJFY,"The story begins around the same time frame as the Battle of the Alamo. Star Trek captain Patrick Stewart, plays the famous Lear whose downfall comes when tries to make his daughters prove their love to him in return for their share of his land.  His first two daughters have no problem lying to their father but Claudia refuses to appease her father's pride.  Lear, outraged by this, banishes her from his sight.  She retreats to her father's enemy, Menchaca.  After this first mistake, Lear's life crumbles beneath him.  He is turned away by his two remaining daughters and eventually begins to lose his mind.
 The King of Texas is the story of Shakespeare's famous play, King Lear, with a western twist.  It reunites all of the characters from the play and though the names have been changed, it is easy to decipher who is who.  One of the best aspects of this movie is that you don't have to have read the play to understand or enjoy the movie nor do you have to be a fan of Shakespeare.  Unlike other adaptations of Shakespearean plays, the language used has been changed to more of a western dialect then the often hard to understand Shakespearean style enabling a more broad audience to enjoy this classic play.  I think it's safe to say that this made for TV movie will be sought after by many to better understand this famous Shakespearean play.",1043280000,3,1354,4.580912863070539
1803979,4,B00007AJFY,"The King of Texas is a western film about a rich man's life endeavors, who finds money can't buy happiness.  The King of Texas also parallel's Shakespeare's tragedy, King Lear.  The movie entails a rich and wealthy man John Lear who divides his land among his daughters Susanna, Rebecca, and Claudia.  These characters throughout the movie carry out the same actions as King Lear's daughters Gonneril, Regan, and Cordelia.  Claudia who parallels the character Cordelia makes the same prideful mistake of not announcing the love she feels for her father.  Susanna and Rebecca, who parallel Gonneril and Regan, both lie about the love for their father, henceforth receiving the fortune but both banish their father in the end.  Susanna's husband is a supporter of John Lear and a very peaceful man, just like Gonneril's husband Albany.  Also, the John Lear's black slave could be compared to the fool due to his jovial manner towards the highly respected, serious Lear, and Kent, the faithful servant.
 My favorite scene that paralleled the movie exactly was the inheritance scene.  The false words that Rebecca Susanna, and Claudia spoke were basically a modified Texan accent, with Shakespearean connotation.  Over all I truly enjoyed the movie, in no way did I find it boring or hard to comprehend.  I think the writer did an excellent job turning Shakespeare into a Western film.",1043280000,,1381,5.039647577092511
1803980,3,B00007AJFY,"I enjoyed most of the movie King of Texas. It was a good representation of William Shakespeare's King Lear. It gives the reader of the Shakespearian play a first hand look at a very similar setting, with words that are a lot easier to follow. It followed the play very well for the most part. The director did a very good job of keeping the original plot throughout the entire movie, with few exceptions. The movie's setting of Texas was the most believable and similar place for the movie to unfold. The characters all did a great job of portraying the originals with not only their words but their actions also. The main character Lear is the most similar character in the movie to the original play. The movie started out following the original play almost exactly but drifted away the farther the movie progressed. This was inevitable though and did not take away from the movie at all. The only complaint had about the movie was some of the scenes at the end that seemed to try to do too much, and the movie wrapped up a lot faster than the book, leaving more questions for the reader. The king of Texas is a good representation of the play King Lear and gives the common reader a good and different look at what is going on in the play.",1043280000,,1242,4.404347826086957
1803981,5,B00007AJFY,The movie King of Texas is William Shakespear's play King Lear set in Texas.  Patrick Stewart plays King Lear and does a great job of it.  He is joined by a wonderful supporting cast that only make the movie better.  Having read King Lear myself and feeling very lost and confused this movie helped greatly to put the words from the play to images in a movie.  I didn't care for the play written in Shakespearean language because I couldn't follow it but once it was put into a movie like this Shakespear's plot and great story line is really brought to life.  This movie helped me really appreciate Shakespear's greatness as a playwright.  Although the movie was very good a few parts were done slightly different than in the original play.  The main difference was in the end which involved everyones deaths.  The characters were not killed in similar fashions to how they were in the play.  Because of this the whole play seemed to wrap a little to short and sweet.  Overall though this movie is worth while watching whether you like Shakespear or don't at all.

The portrayal of Lear with his three daughters was true to the play.  John Lear divvied up the land between Susanna and Rebecca, just as King Lear gave the land to Goneril and Regan.  Both Lears also banished Cordelia (Shakespeare) and Claudia (""King of Texas"") from their land.  The affair between Goneril, Regan, and Edmund was portrayed well with the characters of Thomas, Rebecca, and Susanna.  I also felt that the pity of King Lear after tearing off his clothes after the rain storm was well portrayed.  When John Lear stood on the rock screaming at the storm, and later playing with the flowers shirtless, I felt that same pity.  I enjoyed Ran's fool-like comments towards Lear.  He was the comic relief to the over-all serious nature of the movie.  The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was Lear's entrance into the hacienda courtyard in a robe.  He's portraying a Moses-like character.  I felt that part of the movie was melodramatic and unnecessary.  All in all, I feel that the directors of ""The King of Texas"" did an accurate representation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear.""",1043193600,,1222,4.734597156398104
1803983,4,B00007AJFY,"""King of Texas"" was based upon the play King Lear written by one of the world's best-known playwrights, Shakespeare. This movie was at it's best placed within a more ""modern"" setting compared to plays, pre-Christianity days. Taking place in Texas, the movie begins by the Lear family celebrating one of the few years Texas claimed its independence from the US. The story continues with introducing such familiar characters parallel to their counterparts such as the three sisters, Claudia (Cordelia), Rebecca (Regan), and Susanna (Goneril). The rancher Lear asks his daughters, as in the play, which one loves him the best, and as a reward each daughter is to receive a portion of his ranch. Needless to say, Rebecca and Susanna, the two daughters who least love their father, exaggerate their feelings toward him, where as Claudia, who truly loves her father, will not participate in their ""games."" She is turned out for this, leaving the two evil daughters to manipulate the situation even further for their own success. Of course, as in every Shakespearean play, everyone gets punished in the end for their wrong doings.
 Over all, I believed the movie to be very well written and performed and followed Shakespeare's play, King Lear almost exactly.",1043193600,,1252,5.077669902912621
1803984,5,B00007AJFY,"The King of Texas is an excellent film that takes Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" and puts it into a Western setting.  The King of Texas stays on the same track as ""King Lear"".  I enjoyed this movie because it helped me understand ""King Lear"" and it was put into the type of English that I could understand.  The movie does not get old, even after reading ""King Lear"", because the movie takes the plot and adds excitement to it.  The movie is not a suitable replacement to reading ""King Lear"" for a class, but it will help you with the overall idea and plot of the book.  It is not a suitable replacement because the names are different, as well as the dialog.  I would recomend this movie to anyone who has just read ""King Lear"" and would like to help themselves to understand the play more fully.  The movie is filmed and directed very well and is not a typical western, or TV movie.  In conclusion I would recomend this movie as a good form of entertainment, and also a good film to show an English class who has just finished reading ""King Lear"".",1043107200,,1044,4.345360824742268
1803985,4,B00007AJFY,"Although the story may be hundreds of years old, another timeless Shakespearian tale finds its way to the silver screen in ""King of Texas."" Patrick Stewart plays the leading role as John Lear, a cattle baron who built his empire in south Texas on years of hard work... and blood. His on-going battle with Manchaca, a Mexican ranch owner just south of Lear's ranch, parallels King Lear's feud with the French. Keeping with the story, Claudia, who represents Cordelia from the Shakespearian work, runs off with the enemy after she is turned out by her father. Her two sisters, Susanne and Rebecca, representing Goneril and Reagan, inherit their father's land through deceitful speeches of how great their love is for him. Lear goes mad after both these daughters send him away, while Rip (Davis Alen Grier), representing the fool, provides some comedy relief. This movie is quite accurate to the original work, and the western setting and dialogue create a more tangible atmosphere for some than ""King Lear"" might offer. Even Henry Westover (Roy Scheider), representing the Earl of Gloucester, meets the same horrific torture as in the original work. I would recommend this movie to everyone, even if westerns or Shakespeare aren't your favorite choice of entertainment. 4 stars for ""King of Texas.""",1043107200,,1297,5.065420560747664
7974679,4,B00007AJFY,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2002 and directed by Uli Edel, ""King of Texas"" is a Western starring Patrick Stewart as the proud & loveless title character, John Lear, whose ranch spreads across a vast region of West Texas. His decision to divvy up his empire between his dubious daughters (Marsha Gay Harden & Lauren Holly) based on their willingness to flatter him yields disastrous results as Lear descends into madness and despair. Julie Cox plays his other daughter while David Alan Grier plays his wily man Friday, Rip.

The plots taken from The Bards King Lear. But is also inspired by real-life Texas cattle baron Captain Richard King and his King Ranch in South Texas, which is the largest ranch in Texas, encompassing some 1,289 square miles.

The movie starts shaky with the sequence where Lear divides his holdings between his daughters, but only because you don't yet have a grip on the character of Lear and his dysfunctional relationships with his daughters. The rest of the flick, however, clears things up. One of the best parts is the chemistry that Stewart has with Grier. Their banter back-in-forth is entertaining and often humorous.

What I like most about this Western beyond the great cast, magnificent Mexican locations and moving score, is its uniqueness, which is likely due to it being based on King Lear. Moreover, there are moments of greatness, like when Lear madly chases the eagle as if longing to take flight from the cage of his proud, quirky flesh and this fallen world in general; or when he passionately cries out to God in the storm. If you think its unbelievably melodramatic, you're wrong. Its real.

THE FILM RUNS 95 minutes and was shot in Durango & Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico. WRITER: Stephen Harrigan based on Shakespeares play. ADDITIONAL CAST: Colm Meaney and Patrick Bergin appear as the husbands of Lears daughters. Roy Scheider plays a neighbor and Matt Letscher & Liam Waite his sons while Steven Bauer is on hand as a Hispanic ranch owner threatened by the two daughters outrageous greed.

7974686,5,B00007AJFY,"Shakespeare's King Lear reset in the nineteenth century Republic of Texas. This version stays fairly close to the original story, with the King transformed to a cattle baron, the Fool to a black slave, and the King of France to a gallant Mexican ranchero. Unfortunately in my opinion, Shakespeare's horrible eye-gouging scene is retained, which makes the film unsuitable for children and the sensitive, who otherwise could enjoy this.

Also, there is a geographic inaccuracy. The film takes place in the desert country of West Texas. While the Republic of Texas claimed this area, its area of white settlement was restricted to wooded East and Central Texas, and there were no immense cattle ranches such as Lear owns. In fact, cotton plantations and subsistence farms were the most important land uses, as in the Southeastern states from which the area was settled. Otherwise, the film is historically accurate; even the guns are correct for the period.",1417305600,,954,5.115384615384615
