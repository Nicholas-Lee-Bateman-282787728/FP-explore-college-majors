6565257,4,B00M9WAUGG,"With the name ""The Exorcist"" tainted by the box office flop of ""Exorcist II: Heretic"", it never occurred to production studio Morgan Creek that it might NOT be a good idea to title ""Legion"" ""Exorcist"". Unfortunately, this fine sequel to ""The Exorcist"" got caught in the backlash against that film. That's too bad because ""Exorcist III: Legion"" (originally titled just ""Legion"")is an excellent thriller on its own with strong performances and an eerie atmosphere. ""Exorcist III"" also has dollops of humor in it that is intentional and she's it apart from the parent film. You have to give each director of the sequels props because each film is quite different from what ca e before.

SPOILERS:
""The Exorcist III"" follows Detective Kinderman (George C. Scott) hunts a serial killer with an MO that mimics that of the Gemini Killer--a man executed fifteen years before. All of this ties in to the case of Regan McNeil and her exorcism fifteen years ago as well.

END OF SPOILERS:

I am thrilled that this underrated sequel has finally arrived on Blu-ray but disappointed at the execution by Warner Home Video. To master a film like ""Exorcist III"" for blu-ray would be a challenge particularly if it is put on a BD25 (which is a single layer blu-ray disc). Unfortunately, the film has excessive video noise (which can sometimes appear to be grain--but it's not)due to excessive compression because Warner was too cheap to master this for a BD 50 (a dual layer disc that can handle films like ""Exorcist III""). Warner has fumbled this release by going the cheap route which is a surprise given that even Warner Archive uses BD50's for their releases to ensure that the image quality is exceptional. As a result, the images are often soft without as much detail as one might expect from blu-ray.

The audio isn't very well balanced. for a 5.1 mix, the English audio is driven primarily to the center. A very poor 5.1 remix that needs to be redone. The foreign language audio, on the other hand, is perfectly balanced. Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, German SDH and Dutch.

Special features? You've got to be joking. Warner had previously released ""Exorcist III"" on DVD in a bare bones edition. They've elected to do the same here. Perhaps that's a good thing since this is on a single layer blu-ray and the image quality would be worse. If Warner had used a BD50 here, we could have gotten a retrospective featurette on the difficult production and birth of ""Exorcist III"". As of this writing Blatty and Brad Dourif are both still around to provide their perspective on the making of this unusual and well made sequel to ""The Exorcist"" (Blatty hated the sequel made by John Boormann and actually laughed during the premiere of the film).

For those who are unaware, ""The Exorcist III"" was conceived as film sequel after the success of ""The Exorcist"". Blatty's original screenplay languished in development for ages. He finally wrote the screenplay as a novel and, at that point, Morgan Creek became involved commissioning a film. Blatty's original film had no exorcism in it and Morgan Screen insisted that the third act be reshot including an exorcism. Blatty reasoned that it would be better if he wrote and reshot the footage and the film is, largely, successful even though it strays from his original vision. The original footage has been missing for years and it is believed that it was tossed by Morgan Creek after the failure of the film at the box office. Nevertheless, it's not like an exhaustive attempt to find the footage has been done. With such a fasincating and difficult history, ""The Exorcist III"" would be a prime example (along with ""Exorcist II: Heretic"")of a film that would benefit from a documentary on the making of the film.

There is another version of the film out there in the vaults somewhere. The preview version before the alterations that director/writer William Peter Blatty made. It would also have been nice to get a commentary track from Blatty but that would require paying him and it's clear that Warner doesn't want to put the effort into this. All of that would be forgiveable IF this were a better looking, sharper transfer that was state of the art.

Is this a big upgrade over the original DVD? No. It does improve ever so slightly over the original DVD in a lot of areas but this is hardly a state-of-the-art transfer and a cheap release from Warner.

It's a shame as the film deserves better.

It would have been nice to get this released properly with special features and a top notch transfer. This isn't it. Shame on Warner for going the cheap and shoddy route with this reissue.",1411776000,4,4668,4.780397022332506

6565259,4,B00M9WAUGG,"By far the best movie of the series. A horror movie that sits next to The Shining on my book shelf. A cult horror classic based on great acting(Brad Dourif & GC Scott), writing, and suspense. If you are looking for vomit flying everywhere, gore, heads spinning around, then look elsewhere. It drops to 4 stars based on the lack of extras and Warner Bros lackluster bluray encoding.",1411603200,,381,4.617647058823529
6565260,5,B00M9WAUGG,"Based on the novel, LEGION, William Peter Blatty helms the adaptation as its director (John Carpenter apparently having passed on the gig). This is to our great benefit, for Blatty's directorial eye is lean and efficient, rendering his material in a manner that is stylistically compatible with Friedkin's spare, gritty EXORCIST. The result is an atmospheric, eerie exploration of evil, a  creeper that builds tension and dread, delivering some memorable moments (look for one such moment involving a prolonged stationary shot of a hospital hallway).

George C. Scott as Lt. Kinderman is our principal link to the first story in a role that reveals his great range. Blatty, a comedy writer in his early career (A Shot in the Dark (1964)) fills the mouths of his characters with witty repartee, allowing the ensemble to play off each other and endear themselves to us. By the time things get seriously dark, we've bonded with characters that feel real, raising the stakes for them and us.

A spiritual cousin to Blatty's THE NINTH CONFIGURATION (track this one down!), Blatty weaves similar elements (psychiatry and mental illness) through the proceedings, packaging them with his trademark sardonic wit. But Blatty knows what he's about, and these lighter moments serve a higher purpose - namely, another examination of evil. This time, our perspective is Kinderman's, a man acquainted with depravity's depths. It is his first hand-knowledge of evil that just may lead him to belief.

EXORCIST III: LEGION is the true sequel to THE EXORCIST (let's forget the second film ever happened). Its ultimate strength is that it's not merely a remake of the first story, but instead goes off in a new direction with linkages backward. The 90s was not a great decade for horror, but this serves as the exception - a strong film for any decade. Highly Recommended.",1410220800,6,1853,5.045751633986928
6565261,4,B00M9WAUGG,"The rule of Hollywood series: the first movie is the best one, followed by inferior sequel, and then a third one which is guaranteed to be awful in every way.

But every rule has an exception, and one of those is ""The Exorcist III: Legion,"" which thankfully ignores the ghastly ""Exorcist II."" We can thank William Peter Blatty (author of the original ""Exorcist"" novel) who wrote and directed this movie -- and between his vivid, clever writing and some truly haunting performances, it's a gloriously eerie horror movie. The one downside: a truly awful ending pasted on by the bloody studio.

World-weary Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) is called in on a series of bizarre serial killers in Georgetown -- first a young boy is crucified, decapitated and has the head of a Christ statue placed on his neck, and then a priest is brutally murdered in a confessional. But the crimes strike home for Kinderman when his good friend, Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), is found in the hospital -- decapitated, with all his blood drained.

Certain trademarks of the brutal slayings line up with ""The Gemini"" (Brad Dourif), a serial killer from fifteen years ago. But there are two slight problems with this idea: the fingerprints are all from different people, and the Gemini was executed fifteen years ago. The key to this case may lie in a mysterious patient being held at the hospital, who recently came out of a catatonic state... and claims to be the Gemini Killer, possessing another man's body.

I suspect that ""Exorcist III"" would be more highly regarded if the title did not tie it to one of the most influential horror movies of all time. This a dark, poetic movie that quietly dips into the dark waters of good and evil, and the supernatural currents that run under a horrendous murder investigation. Don't expect serial-killer gore or spinning heads -- expect a subtle, eerie experience.

It astounded me that Blatty -- a horror writer -- also turned out to be such a talented director. He lays a quiet, bleak atmosphere over this movie, painting the scenes in shadow. The most brilliant work is the conversations between the Gemini Killer and Kinderman, with the cop struggling to accept a seemingly impossible solution to these crimes, and a brutal serial killer who is charming, playful and PURE EVIL.

It also has a truly magnificent cast, with Scott taking center stage as a weary, sarcastic cop who struggles to connect the supernatural with his day-to-day job. He also has amazing chemistry with Ed Flanders, who sadly exits the movie pretty quickly -- these two have lots of dry, witty dialogue in between theological banter, and honestly I could have happily watched a whole movie full of their antics.

But Brad Dourif steals the scene every time he appears as the Gemini Killer, putting every ounce of his acting into the Gemini Killer -- unpredictable, menacing, charming and just terrifying (""I call THAT showmanship, Lieutenant!""). He's a human demon, just the sort you'd expect the forces of evil to take under their wing.

... but... then there's the ending. Hoo boy, there's the ending.

Apparently the studio was horrified at the idea of an ""Exorcist"" movie without a climactic exorcism, so the last ten minutes are a cheesy, campy, frenetic mass of special effects presided by a character who pops out of nowhere. You know, exactly what you would expect of a studio-mandated finale.

Despite the ghastly ending, ""The Exorcist III: Legion"" is a vastly underrated little horror movie -- beautifully directed and acted, with a darkly theological undercurrent. Too bad Blatty hasn't directed much else.",1407024000,18,3629,4.915032679738562
6565262,5,B00M9WAUGG,"This movie is one of my favorites.  It should have been called  ""The Exorcist II"" because the real ""Exorcist II: The Heretic"" should never have been made. William Peter Blatty should have stepped in on that one.  Watching ""The Exorcist II: The Heretic"" makes me laugh out loud so bad that it's about the same as watching Hillary Clinton run for president.  But this film ""The Exorcist III"" is a great film and it should have been the follow up to the original.  My only complaint is the picture quality.  I couldn't tell the difference between this Blue Ray version and a regular DVD.  It's not quite what I expected from a Blue Ray disc.  It seemed to have the same grainy quality of a normal DVD.  But I highly recommend watching this film.  BUY IT!",1439683200,,751,4.455882352941177

6565266,1,B00M9WAUGG,"I love this film, but the blu ray transfer here is terrible.  Picture looks weirdly murky, like an engineer was messing with the contrast too much, but the real crime here is the sound.  It's doubly a shame for this film, because the sound processing is done so well, and that, the writing, along with the acting on the parts of Scott, Dourif, Miller, and Flanders, are the parts that carry the film.  The original reIeases on VHS and DVD actually had a dynamic range to them, like most films do, and why most films have far superior sound engineering compared to most music, but this blu ray sounds like it was hyper-compressed, like a casualty of the loudness wars in music.  I never thought the loudness wars would ever extend to film sound.  It completely ruins the film.  Each miniscule sound is as loud as the most terrifying scenes, making the entire experience fatiguing and irritating.  To me, sound engineering should be about a journey, and the story that you tell with your soundscapes carry the content where it needs to go.  With this blu ray, they took a film with wonderfully effective and artistic sound engineering and turned it into a processed block of cheese cut into huge chunks and shoved in your face.  Unless they release an improved BluRay, stick with the DVD, it's the only way actually to experience this film.

One note: I love William Peter Blatty (one of the few people not to underestimate Scott Wilson).  I love his writing, and his sense of comedy is the absolute best.  I think that he has many shortcomings as a director, but I still love him, and I think his personality shows through in his small amount of film work.  The Exorcist III has fundamental problems as a film and weird continuity issues following Friedkin's The Exorcist (e.g., How can Kinderman describe Karras as his best friend?), but, to paraphrase The Gemini Killer, the overall effect of the film is still astounding haha.  I hate that there are weirdly low quality aspects of this film, but at least they stand in stark contrast to the completely wonderful aspects of the film that make it stand on it's own.",1423872000,,2115,4.650537634408602
6565267,5,B00M9WAUGG,"Exorcist III (Legion) is one of those under-appreciated gems.  Exorcist II (Heretic) didn't do that well, so maybe some people thought that this (part III) wasn't worth a watch.

6565268,1,B00M9WAUGG,"I just wanted to let true fans of Legion know that the original footage still exists and is in excellent condition. Brad Doriff actually did a personal screening for a few select folks (I was so lucky to be a part of that since it may never  be seen again!) at a horror convention about three years back in Charlotte, NC.  He introduced the film as Legion only, saying it was never intended to be called Exorcist III at allthat was the studio.  Needless to say, the horrible film sold here, is a totally different film than Blatty actually made and intended and this is one of the worst travesties to have ever taken place regarding a discrepancy between a film studio and a book/film-maker.  I have see a few reviewers here who said they hoped the original footage still exists, so I wanted to assure folks it does and is absolutely wonderful.  It is odd that for the most part, it seems like another film than the one that was released.  I do hope someday Legion will be released.",1421280000,5,982,4.427777777777778

8670984,5,B00M9WAUGG,"This film was written and directed by the original writer of the first Exorcist film, William Peter Blatty. The film skips over the unintended outrageously funny ""Exorcist II, The Heretic"", by focusing not on the further adventures of Reagan (the little girl who was possessed on the original film), but on the cop Kinderman (played by Lee J Cobb in E1, and George C Scott in E3), Father Dyer (William O'Malley on E1, Ed Flanders on E3), and the resuscitated (yet never investigated) father Damien Karras (Jason Miller).  WHile the first Exorcist film was horror in almost every minute of the film, on Exorcist III, we find ourselves laughing at the comic dialogue between Kinderman and Dyer for about the first third of the film. The film takes a dark turn once Father Dyer is beheaded. And while the horror is explained this time, through the rantings of James Venamun/The ""Gemini Killer"" (Brad Dourif), there are many loose ends in the film that, once one starts pondering on the logic, find that there is a lot in it that makes no sense. The film features a galaxy of great actors. The studio spared no expense hiring some of the best people to appear on screen, both credited and uncredited. Just like on the short lived TV comedy series ""Police Squad!"", the film demands that the viewer pay close attention to details both on the foreground and on the background of the scenes. Unfortunately, the film, as released in 1990, ,suffers from last minute improvisation caused by the studio moguls that demanded a last minute ""demonic battle"" between Father Morning (whose appearance in the film has no explanation whatsoever), and the Gemini Killer inside the body of Damien Karras through the work of the demons who had a score to settle with the priest. Watch it for the comedy, some of the horror, and the cinematography - which attempts, successfully but surreally, to cram much into some short cut scenes.  This film will not bring out your fears as Exorcist did in 1974, but it's a good ride, and you get to see some of the best actors of the silver screen together in what could have been a much better film. I blame the dopeheads from Morgan Creek for this.",1499731200,,2166,4.697368421052632
