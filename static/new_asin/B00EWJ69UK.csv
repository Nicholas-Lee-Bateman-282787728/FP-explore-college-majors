8610059,1,B00EWJ69UK,"There ought to be a law against these unauthorized dvd's. but, having said that, if there are those of you who enjoy these, perhaps I'll make one. I certainly have enough knowledge to do so, and I'll be sure to look you all up so you can give me some of your money. Believe me, it would be no different than giving these rip-off artists your cash. These should be filed under the bootleg category and should only be sold in back rooms, not here on Amazon. And it's not being done to only Pink Floyd. There are countless bands being ripped off by these people. They get there hands on some footage, find the legal loop-holes to be able to present it without being sued, and then sit around for an hour or so giving you their opinions on the artist's work. I CAN DO THIS TOO! Bottom line is anything with ""under review"" or ""Independent"" in the title is a rip off! And the nerve of these people trying to make this crap look official! And the nerve of these people re-releasing this garbage under a new title, not just once but many times over! And Amazon, in their ignorance, list these titles as having been released by the bands they cover. THIS TITLE IS NOT RELEASED ""BY PINK FLOYD"" AS AMAZON CLAIMS! This particular release should NOT even be allowed to use ""Pink Floyd"" in the title! AVOID!",1393459200,2,1293,4.369294605809128
8610060,1,B00EWJ69UK,"So I got this box set for my boyfriend for Christmas. Open the entire set, played the first DVD In my Xbox and it wouldn't play. So I tried it in two other of my DVD players and NONE of the DVDs would play. We took out every single DVD from the entire box set & NONE of them would work.
  So I got a replacement from amazon, for the box set. And as soon as I got the replacement that one did the same thing. I'm wondering if there may be some sort of malfunction in their shipment of those. I called costumer service and she wasn't quite sure about another replacement on top of the 2 malfunctional ones. So I was given a refund instead, to avoid the same problem. If you're contemplating getting this item I highly suggest holding off for a bit.",1389657600,,746,4.102739726027397
8610061,2,B00EWJ69UK,"I bought this item for my husband's Christmas present, and had pre-ordered, so no reviews were available. Of course he couldn't wait to open it when he figured out it was a box set of something. I was so excited as he is a HUGE Pink Floyd fan. He opened it up and popped it right in the DVD player and we were both a bit confused. I knew it was the 'history' of Pink Floyd, and knew there would be footage from their tours, etc. But I figured there would also be some current information in there, maybe some new interviews...something that would constitute a 'new release'...there was nothing. It's all original film and even the interviews are old. It's still good to have, but just not what I was expecting to get. Kinda like waiting in line for an Xbox One and getting an Original Xbox...",1386892800,8,792,4.358108108108108
8610062,1,B00EWJ69UK,"On Amazon's UK site it breaks down what these DVDs are....

DVD 1 Pink Floyd a critical review 1967 1974
DVD 2 Pink Floyd a critical review 1975 1996
DVD 3 Rock Milestones The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn
DVD 4 Rock Milestones A Saucerful Of Secrets
DVD 5 Rock Milestones Ummagumma
DVD 6 Rock Milestones Atom Heart Mother
DVD 7 Rock Milestones Meddle / Dark Side of the Moon
DVD 8 Wish You Were Here
DVD 9 The Wall / The Final Cut
DVD 10 A Momentary lapse of Reason.

All of these DVDs have been previously released and if you read the Amazon reviews for them you'll see that they were universally hated and dismissed as worthless junk.  I always take reviews with a grain of salt, but when everyone hates something a person should take note.

So all we have here is previously released DVDs being re-released in one shiny package in an effort to soak more money out of us Pink Floyd fans.  They won't be getting any of mine.",1385078400,20,923,4.251428571428572
