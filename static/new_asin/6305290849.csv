7886837,5,6305290849,"Swing Craze was all that I hoped it would be an much,much more. A Fantastic start for all the swing craze wanabes. It is a must for beginners.",1409270400,,142,4.107142857142857
7886838,3,6305290849,Very fast pace . You have to be able to follow moves without deep instructions . its 1920's to 50's style dance. Good for reviewing moves before you go out to dance because  he reviews 10 steps in 10 minutes at end of dvd . Pablo is a good dancer . moves are easy to see and hear. intermediate lessons on dvd are a joke. Only good for beginners,1389312000,,344,3.9855072463768115
7886839,1,6305290849,"These people are just bad...really bad.  The moves are really lame and some spins will not work at all because there is no initiation at all.  Do not listen to instruction on getting out of cuddle position.  It is just plain wrong.  The jam session at the end of tape usually highlight some of the moves they taught or just allows the instructors to strut their stuff.  Here, it is just downright laughable.  These people are just so bad, I guarantee you will see better dancers at your local swing club or swing event.",1234137600,,519,4.468085106382978
7886840,4,6305290849,"Some reviewers have expressed their dislike of this video...but I have to say...compared to what I have seen...this one is the best swing dance video I have seen.  It is clear, easy to follow and covers quite a lot of information.  Sure it lacks the super shiny editing efforts and sound engineering...(the garnish)  but there is enough information here to get you started so you can practice the basics of swing.  It's affordably priced and the teachers are real and likable in their presentations.  I checked this video out from the library...then purchased a copy for myself.  If you are uncertain, check your local library and preview the tape...better yet...preview several swing videos...and you will soon see what I mean about this one holding its own!",1209945600,2,759,4.984126984126984
7886841,3,6305290849,"The DVD is good for an introduction to swing dance, but you could get a lot more out of going to classes. After I purchased this item I attended BYU's Swing Kids club, and realized that the dancers on the DVD are not nearly as talented or fun to watch as the people in that club. Still, if you don't have access to a swing club this will give you a start on the style and steps of swing dancing.",1168560000,,395,3.95
7886842,3,6305290849,"This is a good video for beginners.  It taught me all the East Coast basics, and I feel pretty confident with my East Coast now. The quality is pretty low budget, but it's a dance instructional video, not a feature  film.  Anyhow, they play a great song at the start of the swing jam, but  they fail to credit it anywhere.  If anyone out there knows the name of the  song, post it here.  Thanks.",943142400,7,395,4.1866666666666665
