8554577,2,B000URKQ02,"""The Best of Soul Train""?  Well, a product description would have been nice. Since there isn't one, hopefully this review will serve as a heads up for the next buyer.

This DVD is, as advertised, clips from the TV show ""Soul Train"" from the '70's.  The DVD is mostly comprised of highlights from the ""Soul Train"" portion of the show, featuring dancers being spotlighted in the Soul Train line.  There are also clips of musical acts.

It's enjoyable to watch... if, and that's a big IF... you don't mind the fact that you're merely watching someone's home videos.  Yes... this is not put out by Don Cornelius productions, it is simply a compilation of videos recorded at home and thrown together on a DVD.  You can tell by the disc itself that it was burned, not professionally stamped.  Another tell tale sign is the broadcast station trademark displayed in the lower right hand corner of nearly every chapter.

Presumably, to compensate for this fact, you are also offered a music CD featuring a mix of mediocre house music.

It is what it is.  Buy it, don't buy it, but be warned, it is not a real clear, crisp production one would expect from a TV compilation DVD.  Definitely not worth the $20 price tag.",1189209600,46,1208,4.593457943925234
