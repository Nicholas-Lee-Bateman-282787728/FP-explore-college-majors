5915236,5,B00EI3XAZC,"The movie is a great action flick and the plot, screen play and dialogue are smart, sophisticated and informed.
In sum, the battle scarred hero of North Korean intelligence based in Berlin attempts to defend himself from a
double cross. The best Korean films feature lightning fast fighters (non-CGI) giving and taking solid body blows
using walls, pipes, books, staplers or really anything that comes to hand. Berlin file provides plenty of it logically
arranged at points in the story where forces would collide. The film seems to draw comparisons between the
stalwart agent of the North who has been formed under the brutal communist cult of personality to the leader where any
divergence from the party is a cause for liquidation, and the dogged counter spy of the South Korean team joined to the point of death with the ideology of  ""team"" and ""job.""  The North agent has to put his marriage second to duty to the party and the South agent has to knock aside corrupt self serving bureaucrats becoming a rogue in the process.  Many fine details make it a
prime offering in the genre.",1395878400,2,1087,4.7712765957446805
5915237,1,B00EI3XAZC,"Lots of stereotypes perpetuated (bad guys for all of the following): Americans, Arabs; North & South Koreans; Germans. Whatever images you may have for each of those groups - don't bother to change them.
Poorly written (difficult to follow) with lots of highly improbable events like different groups from the above all happening to show up at the same obscure spot at the same time; lots of dubious, if not down right dumb decision making (credulity stretching) by members of all those groups just to maintain 90 minutes of film activity. Usual fight scenes and shoot outs that make you go - pleeease, can't you come up with anything creative that hasn't been done in two thousand movies already. Example of an improbable, done before: Woman (with heavy backpack) falls from rooftop and at last second grabs gutter by fingertips with no more effort than if she were painting her nails. Poorly edited resulting in a jump around, disjointed film. English as second language for most of the actors along with poor enunciation and audio level control (outside of subtitles for the Korean) makes most of the film (80%) difficult/impossible to listen to.

I offer a similar, and much better, Korean movie, ""Commitment"" as a substitute.",1395532800,2,1230,4.970873786407767

5915241,4,B00EI3XAZC,I am glad they have this movie for instant play.  Korean movies - thrillers and action- lately have surpassed HK movies.  Berlin File is pretty polished visually.  The non-Korean actors do come across as bad actors but the Korean cast is great.  The movie is fast paced and is a good spy thriller like bourne series.,1391212800,,316,4.589285714285714
5915242,4,B00EI3XAZC,"The story almost got lost in the script.  I was dropping bread crumbs fast as I could.  But it was still a very good movie.
I did miss English subtitles.  That would have been a help for me.  And a couple of scenes seemed to be searching for light at the end of the tunnel.  But over all, it was very good.  Lots of action.",1390176000,,323,3.8923076923076922
5915243,4,B00EI3XAZC,"When it comes to South Korean action thrillers, there are few who can match director (sometimes actor/stuntman) Ryoo Seung-Wan. The man knows how to make his action films with style, intense and even at times, funny....but he certainly knows when and how to make the proper tempo and mood for his action films. He has come a long way since ""Arahan"", ""No Blood, No Tears"", ""The Unjust"" and ""City of Violence"", and he appears to be on a roll with his latest 2013 Korean film ""The Berlin File"". A spy thriller that otherwise appears to be more of the same, Seung-Wan who also writes and directs, comes out with something familiar and yet different; as he manages to make the stakes much more personal. This may be the best spy thriller to hail from Korea since ""Shiri"".

A tense arms deal goes horribly wrong, and North Korean operative Pyo Jong-Seong (Ha Jung-Woo, The Yellow Sea) narrowly escapes when Israeli mossad agents barge into the scene. A little lost and surprised, Pyo comes across conflicting evidence as to how things had gone wrong and just who it was who set him up. Meanwhile, a South Korean operative, Jung Jin-Soo (Han Suk-kyu) goes after Pyo in the hopes of decoding his identity and to determine if he is some kind of double agent. What he finds is something much more complicated, as some things did not fit the North Korean's part of the deal. What makes things worst is that suspicion had arisen on Pyo's own wife, Jung-Hee (Gianna Jun, The Thieves) who also serves as a translator for the North Korean ambassador and Pyo has 48 hours to prove otherwise. The North Koreans have dispatched a ruthless fixer named Dong Myung-Soo (Ryoo Seung-Bun, Arahan) to get to the bottom of the leak within. Now, Pyo must do what he can to clear himself, save his loveless marriage and try to get to the bottom of a multi-billion dollar account wanted by the Pyongyang authorities.

The film carries some real world devices and moves its elements around in a game of cat and mouse. Those who are familiar with spy thrillers would know the possible scenarios when it comes to films such as this. Government officials with their own agenda, a nation's reputation at stake, defections and betrayal, a spy who gets burned and set up; but what the movie adds its more personal stake into the matter. I know, you may say that a spy and his wife can also be seen as familiar device, but what the writing does so well is the way it flows to create suspense and thrills that the viewer would be at the edge of his seat. It does an incredible job in setting things up. The screenplay keeps things close and yet distant, as there were two areas that move around the script to get to its finality. On one side, we have Jong-Seung, who is trying to uncover who has betrayed him and the other side, we have a South Korean who wishes to uncover the truth for his country and protect its interests. The writing does a good job in presenting the case from two different viewpoints. It was also nice to see a loyal North Korean character become the main protagonist.

The direction was amazing in dictating the film's pace. Ryoo Seung-Wan made all the right decisions to create tension, drama and suspense to drive the film's momentum. His editing was certainly top notch and he takes the set pieces to his advantage. The film was shot in 4 languages, and it gives the film a feeling of authenticity, and it drives a feeling of unpredictability. The film is also incredibly action-packed; shot with loads of style and careful editing that would make the big-shots of Hollywood jealous. The direction certainly knew how to make the action scenes look cool, his editing was steady in keeping up with the action sequences that this may be Ryoo's most polished film to date. It was easy to become enthralled in the action set pieces as one could easily feel the pain and impact from the hand to hand combat. Yet, Ryoo always took the time to inject the emotions behind each scene. From each gunfire, to every hand-to-hand combat, Ryoo carefully placed the scenes to complement the next, as each action set piece became much more cooler than the previous one. Unlike some of his earlier films that had more style than emotion, Ryoo was able to create emotional and even cerebral tension as Pyo goes about his way trying to figure out the main players. Since the stakes were carefully defined, what was presented were chase sequences, fight choreograph and gun battles that had a personality.

Of course none of these would be effective if the performers lacked the necessary `grit' to pull off the characters' dimensions. Ha Jung-Woo delivered the proper layers of complexity even in the smallest expression and delivery of the shortest, simplest line. I do have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised with the range displayed by Ryu Seung-Bun as he skillfully executes his role. The two managed to create the tension necessary for a protagonist and antagonist; and this made the final encounter much more effective in delivering the needed `punch' in the climax. Gianna Jun was also very deft in her performance as was Han Suk-kyu. The main supporting cast also delivered that the action could easily command the attention of its viewer for its entirety. The film did not feel like it was almost 120 minutes, as Ryoo Seung-Wan certainly had me at the palm of his hand with his execution of tense character conflict. Yeah, I know there was a scene outside Pyo's apartment that required a suspension of disbelief since no one seemed to hear what was going on, but Seung-Wan made me almost overlook that minor lack of detail.

Despite the fact that this may be the most polished action thriller I have seen this year, I do have to admit that the main core of the plot felt pretty standard. The writing was definitely not trying to reinvent but rather present things in a way that felt fresh and made for maximum showmanship. I do have to commend the turns it took to become a little erratic and unpredictable, but really the final resolution became a little too expected and it did leave room for a sequel. However, ""The Berlin File"" has smartly placed action sequences, top notched performances, awesomely staged fights and a breathtaking pace that is sure to awe its audience. The film is exhilarating as Ryoo Seung-wan brings a lot of machismo and quicksilver like flair to his film, that I am sure that we'll see him directing a Hollywood film very soon. Highly Recommended. [4  Out of 5 Stars]",1385856000,2,6481,4.665791776027996

5915246,4,B00EI3XAZC,"I confess that it was hard to figure out what was going on in the movie because in this spy movie everyone seems to be double crossing each other and are at each others throat.
Pyo Jong-seong is a ghost agent - an agent without a record. He had been mixed up in an weapons deal which went bad and now everybody seems to want him dead, his own agency, and a host of others and that includes his wife as well.
Everything that has to go wrong  for Pyo does so throughout the film and that makes the film very enjoyable. Some of the action scenes are just too good. However there are times when the pace slackens and the film might have benefited from some editing. Nevertheless, I loved watching the film if only for the action sequences.

8605566,5,B00EI3XAZC,"The Berlin file is a welcome addition to my ever-growing collection of Korean drama/thriller films. Extremely well acted, with spectacularly staged action sequences. There is a lot of intrigue, and does require close attention; particularly in the first half of the film. At about halfway through, the real edge of seat action begins. Ha Jung-woo is excellent as always, and Gianna Jun (aka Jun Ji-hyun) delivers yet another amazing performance. I don't want to give spoilers, but suffice to say that all does not end well for everyone, and I was not pleased with certain outcomes. But that attests to how much one becomes drawn into the film and characters. The sound quality and surround effects on the Blu-ray disc were also excellent. Highly recommended.",1515196800,,758,5.072

8605569,4,B00EI3XAZC,"Excellent human action packed film that has many different set pieces from stair well, subway tunnel, street, running with the car, and open field chasing, gun fighting from 2 to a dozen often in confined space, hand to hand combat in confined space, and a realistic and fantasy combined falling sequence that involved wires.  Due to the budget, there's no Bondsque car chasing or mass explosion but what it has I was impressed.  The actors pretty much do their own stunt work unless it's too technical or dangerous (the sequence involving a moving car and a body hanging by its side for example).  They made the chase, combat, and gun fight looked realistic, not just acting or camera angle.

I love the steadier camera work.  Even when the lens moved with the action, it was never too jerky to enjoy.  The color pallet fits the tone of the story really well.  It's old and worn but not without some hope.

The 4 Korean lead actors are excellent.  I can't judge how well the 3 who played North Koreans spoke the North Korean dialect.  Apparently the accent, word choice, and intonation are very different than a westernized and cosmopolitan Seoul Korean.  But they captured the body language from growing up in a totalitarian regime in contrast with the lone South Korean spy's.  The bad guy is particularly terrifying.  He had no qualm in disposing anyone who stood in his way; psychopathic.

This isn't a 5-star movie because the plot is somewhat convoluted.  If it could simplified (not dumb down), it would serve the film better.  The gun fights were also a bit pushing to the fantasy realm.  Thousand runs of bullets would have disposed the actors much faster.

To conclude, this film really shines showing action in confined space.  I love the pared down aspect of it.  It's much more enjoyable for the spectators like me.  For a budget under $10 million USD, this Korean film is not shabby at all.",1494460800,,1905,4.712121212121212
