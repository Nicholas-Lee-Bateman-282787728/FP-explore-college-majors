8400112,3,B003M5NSW2,Though the story is not entirely about love.  Its more about the uncertainties of life.  Self induced tragedies and pessimism.,1353974400,,126,5.25
8400113,2,B003M5NSW2,"""Spring Fever"" is a very daring attempt at depicting sensitive issues but lack strong storyline.  Praise to the actors who had to shed their inhibitions in order to make the scenes look that much more realistic.",1296691200,2,211,4.861111111111111
8400114,4,B003M5NSW2,A good moive indeed despite of the image of the moive.  What I heard this movie is taken by a video carmea but I think it is still worth to see this great movie.  I do like all the actors and actress in the movie.  One thing I do not like is the ending of this movie(kind of sad....). Please do not miss the chance to buy this amazing movie.,1285545600,2,341,3.842857142857143
