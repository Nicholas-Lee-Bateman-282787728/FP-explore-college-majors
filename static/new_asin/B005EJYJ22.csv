8468400,5,B005EJYJ22,"Watched the show on Nickelodeon starting in 2007 till they stopped showing it. Helped me laugh through healing from accident.

Loved the show. Miss it. Favorite characters Grandma, Grandpa, Fluffy Bunnies, Prof Prof, Doctor Doctor, Changed Daily, Ray, and of course Victor and Anita.

 Is it possible to get all the episodes in English compatible to U.S. dvds? 5 stars easy!!!!!",1419379200,2,378,5.163934426229508
