2561325,5,B000FDFFTS,"I have seen Kris Kristofferson in the 80's  immediately I was taken back to those times.  The songs are great! All his greatest hits are there along with some lesser known songs that may wow you.  Kris with his Border Lords puts on a high energy show.  If you enjoy Kristofferson, you will definitely want to have this item.

One disappointment to note, the concert looks like it was filmed with one camera and rarely moved its focus away from Kris.  I would have liked to have seen some views of the audience reacting to the concert.",1233273600,6,534,4.453608247422681
2561326,5,B000FDFFTS,"There is nothing like kicking back, hitting play, and then letting the sonorous voice of Kris Kristofferson wash over you while you indulge in a moment of forever... I first listened to ""Me and Bobby Mcgee"" when it was performed by Gordon Lightfoot.  Soon after, I discovered the Kristofferson version and avidly set about collecting every version possible: Janis Joplin (swoon), the Grateful Dead (oh, man, what a guitar lick), Waylon Jennings...but there is only one Kris Kristofferson.  This DVD is an essential part of any Kristofferson collection.  In fact, there is not a disappointing note or moment on it.  Its companion DVDs are also excellent (all the Austin concerts), but this DVD is exceptional.",1188950400,17,708,5.130434782608695
2561327,5,B000FDFFTS,This is an excellent bio/singing dvd.  He sings a lot of his good songs and is very informative on his life.  I am one of his Biggest fans so I can't say anything bad about him.  He's the best!,1171670400,10,193,3.8974358974358974
2561328,5,B000FDFFTS,"This DVD is Kristofferson at his best, and it don't get any better than that. The backing group including Donnie Fritts and Billy Swan are superb.",1153267200,14,146,4.653846153846154
2561329,5,B000FDFFTS,"After just watching this for the first time (there will be countless more to come), I'm blown away -- what a beautiful flashback!  Lots of fun to see the guys in the band again too, and Kris . . . perfection.  'Nuf said.",1150761600,19,220,4.093023255813954
2561330,5,B000FDFFTS,Kris is my all-time favorite country singer.  I love this edition from Austin.  I wish someone would compile a DVD of Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge.  They sang so well together.  I have their record albums mostly recorded on Monument Records.  Please let me know if this is possible.,1430092800,,290,4.836734693877551
2561331,5,B000FDFFTS,"If you like the work of Kris Kristofferson, you will like this concert from Austin TX.  It's at a good time in his life, 5 years sober and also liking where he is within his family.  His music is mellow here, telling wonderful stories that I do not hear on other tracks.  I was hoping that some of these compositions would have been on his later works.  That is why this would be a good concert to have in your collection.  I am very happy to have it.  He is past 78 now, still writing those wonderful stories to music, but he is on the road as a single and traveling New Zealand and Australia but Maui is home for him and Lisa and gang of kids.  He is losing his memory so what is really great is that while on tour he may get stuck in the first few words of a song or with a phrase during the song and he'll just tell the audience and someone will howler out the few short words he needs as kick start and everyone takes it all good naturedly, especially Kris and off he goes and finishes the wonderful song he is still bringing to life.",1419379200,5,1039,4.0390243902439025

2561338,4,B000FDFFTS,I've always loved Kris Kristofferson's music. My only disappointment is that this DVD is edited and does not show the entire concert. That interferes with the flow of the music. Still it's a joy to listen to.,1365206400,,208,4.648648648648648

8120963,5,B000FDFFTS,"Being a fan of Kris Kristofferson's song writing skills, my purchase of this video enables me to enjoy his work, and participate in the pleasure of doing it with his large audience. (Especially since the concert almost didn't happen, due to rodents chewing through the station's power cables.)",1468886400,3,293,5.125

8120966,3,B000FDFFTS,"This is probably the only full concert DVD featuring just Kristofferson available. The DVD is decent. Kristofferson does seem a little tired and just about all the songs are slow, but perhaps that's just his normal style. He does attempt to crack a few jokes during the show, but only gets an audience reaction from a couple of them. If you're a Kristofferson fan like me, I recommend this DVD. It probably won't blow you away though.",1445385600,2,434,4.64935064935065
