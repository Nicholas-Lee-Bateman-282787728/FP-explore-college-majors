7834381,3,6303026230,"This is another volume of ""Animated Classics of Japanese Literature,"" a series of video releases culled from a 1986 Japanese TV program, originally titled ""Famous Works of Japanese Literature."" It contains two stories, ""The Izu Dancer,"" by Yasunari Kawabata, and ""The Dancing Girl,"" by Ohgai Mori. Both are beautifully executed tales of young men who become involved in relationships with female dancers. ""The Izu Dancer"" focuses on young Mizuhara, a high school student passing through the country region of Izu for a few days before returning to school, who is drawn to a girl from a family of traveling dance performers. ""The Dancing Girl,"" a rare episode which takes place in Europe, follows Ota, a young man with a career in Foreign Service before him, as he takes an assignment in Berlin in 1885 and soon falls in love with a poor German girl, Elise, who works as a dancer and lives with her mother. The two get married and Ota learns Elise is pregnant just as he is being pressured to return to Japan with the Foreign Secretary and pursue his career.
The first story is a touching, bittersweet tale of burgeoning young love and offers beautifully rendered watercolor backgrounds depicting the lush countryside of Izu and the small towns the characters pass through. We also get to see the dance troupe perform. The second story is a real tearjerker and viewers should be warned that it is quite downbeat (like many episodes in this series). Still, it is magnificently done, with evocative recreations of 19th century Berlin. This series is invaluable to fans of anime for the insights it offers into Japanese customs, mores and ways of life that existed during the years when Japan had one foot in the modern world and one foot in the feudal era.",1059955200,2,1753,4.827242524916944
