8193832,5,B000PY510A,I love this video. It is really cool because it contains all three videos of Mt. Everest. If you are a fan of this mountain and love to see real accounts of climbing this dangerous mountain then buy it. It is really awesome.,1271635200,3,224,4.232558139534884
8193833,5,B000PY510A,"We all go about our days here, locked into our earth-bound lives. But  watching this ""Everest"" one seems to be swept up to leave the earth of our daily lives and we, our dreams and our spirits seem to fly up above the Earth. The beauty of the almost impossible to achieve video just rips one's daily life away and takes one up among the stars.
This group of producers has done a magnificent thing.",1236038400,5,397,4.293333333333333
