Unfortunately, only two OAVs were ever produced (to my knowledge),  both of which illustrate key points in the manga series, but without  knowledge of the manga, this series may not be entirely interesting for  some people. However, at the same time, it may interest people to look into  the manga (like me!) to find out more.
CLAMP's drawing style is quite  unmistakeable; especially the eyes, and I have to admit to being rather  partial to their style. The animation quality in the OAV is a bit of an odd  mix however using a combination of some very nicely detailed shots,  combined with camera pans over less detailed still drawings. Definitely not  a high budget production, but using the budget in an innovative manner. The  music is a bit unusual; rather dark in places, and makes heavy use of a  synthesizer, but is still well done. The translations are also decent  although there is occasionally a bit of awkward wording due to literal  translations. The story while interesting on its own leaves many, many  questions which are not answered unless you go to the manga series (ex.  just who is Kujaku? ) Unfortunately, these questions won't be answered in  the anime. There is a brief background narrative at the beginning of the  episode which helps to fill in some of the history which passed and gives  the viewer a starting point. Otherwise my only problem with the animation,  was that I find the concept of exchanging looks in anim just looks too  contrived.",965779200,7,1627,4.7188612099644125
7839348,5,6303104266,"Visually stunning from the very beginning, the quality of the drawings does not lessen throughout the remainder of this video. It is simply one of the best drawn anime I have ever seen, setting new standards of quality. As  usual, CLAMP's distinctively beautiful style comes though. In my opinion,  it is their best work yet. The story line is complex, but very imaginative  and engrossing. The only complaint I have is that there are only two tapes.  But if you want more of this superb anime, be sure to read the manga.",947116800,,521,4.630434782608695
7839349,5,6303104266,"I was purely thrilled when I watched this anime title for the first time, the graphic work is so vivid and beautiful as is the story. It is pure fantasy mixed in with action and drama, and who here doesn't like histories  of different worlds? I definitely recommend this anime to those of you who  are hard-core fantasy fans!",945907200,,325,4.491525423728813
