8669786,2,B00M29R4XI,"I don't blame Henry Rollins one bit for not wanting to show his face in this movie. While not all movies can be originally themes, they should at least bring something unique to the table. This doesn't bring anything to the genre. Low budget isn't an excuse for poor plot development, characters, or pace of the movie.

The actors weren't as horrible as some in this category I've seen on here, but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement either. And as much as I love Henry Rollins in so many of his works, he really didn't add anything to this. In fact, hearing his voice and knowing who it was actually left me focusing more on ""Is he going to show himself?"" so it even became a distraction.",1497139200,,695,4.4296875
8669787,1,B00M29R4XI,This flick is about 2 jabronies who get themselves kidnapped and tortured. I could relate because I felt tortured having to sit through this. On a positive note if you're having trouble falling asleep at night then this is the movie for you.,1493596800,2,241,4.627906976744186
8669788,2,B00M29R4XI,The only thing this movie had going for it was the suspense and left me with more questions afterward than during.,1491177600,,114,4.476190476190476

8669791,4,B00M29R4XI,"set in the 80s, a couple is kidnapped, held and tortured (mainly psychologically), by some unseen man who orders them through the telephone.  the young actors do great jobs depicting the stages one might go through when all hope is finally lost.  i was really creeped out by their keeper's sick demands on them and his finale in the movie.  haha.  oh, and by the way, we are never treated to the vision of Henry Rollins' mug!",1476576000,,425,4.48051948051948
8669792,1,B00M29R4XI,"2012 psycho-horror flic about two people locked in a basement. Very low budget, blood and violence. No redeeming qualities that I could see. Sorry I watched it.",1476144000,3,160,4.962962962962963
8669793,3,B00M29R4XI,"Overall In The House Of Flies fails to really be horrific, often the film becomes a bit boring. The slow paces, mild nature did little to thrill me. The drama, writing, and effects were pretty stellar for an indie micro-budget film like this. Carrers shows real talent with In The House Of Flies but the lack of action, and real energy keeps the film from really excelling considering the concept. The ending is a bit underwhelming, considering the cool vibe created by the opening scenes. It would have been nice if Carrer would have finished with that level of energy considering how sedate the majority of the film tends to be.

The special effects are subdued, limited practical effects that offer a mix of gore, and grit. The majority of In The House Of Flies effectiveness as a horror film comes from the cramped setting, creepy props, insects, and macabre atmosphere. These things are 90 percent of the films horror element, sometimes giving us chilly realness, other times remaining inert properties. The sound effects do offer up an extra dose of despair, which helps to create that suspenseful unease effect. I had no real complaints on that aspect of this film.",1431216000,2,1172,4.830845771144278
