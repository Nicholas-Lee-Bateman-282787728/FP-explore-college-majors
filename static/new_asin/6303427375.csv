7846089,4,6303427375,"I'm always hunting around for good 80s music related items. This is a hot one, especially if you are a Berlin fan. There are 2 of their videos on this tape: Sex(I'm A...) and No More Words.
Also, other hard to find videos are Ric Ocasek(lead singer of Cars) with Emotion in Motion during his solo career, Madness-with  ""Our House"" and Wang Chung with both of their hits ""Dance Hall Days"" and ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight"".
If you miss what MTV was like in about 1983, then this is a tape for you. IF you are curious to what it might have been like or are trying to throw a raging 80s party, this tape could put you on the cutting edge. The 80s was MORE than Michael Jackson, Ronald Reagan, and Boy George.
