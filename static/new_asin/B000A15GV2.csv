8071957,5,B000A15GV2,"a must see for all nicole-kidman-fans. weird miniserie from the time when nobody knew her outside australia, when she was young, fresh and totally overtalented and yet untouched by cosmetic surgery. still very 80ies, worst soundtrack on earth, otherwise a rare jewel in kidman's portfolio.",1265414400,,289,5.444444444444445
8071958,5,B000A15GV2,"THis was the third mini-series that Nicole Kidman starred in during the 1980's in Australia (the first two being ""Cowra Breakout"" and ""Vietnam""). Like the first two, ""Bangkok Hilton' Was produced and directed by Kennedy-Miller who are more famous for their 1979 classic movie ""Mad Max"".

Now, back to the review. ""Bangkok Hilton"" is a brilliant mini-series which focusses on a girl who travels overseas to find the father she never knew. On her travels she meets a man who promises her love, but while she is not looking, hides heroin in her camera case.  After an unsuccessful attempt to meet her father while in Bangkok, she prepares to fly out unaware of the contents of her camera case.  She is caught going through customs and ends up in a Bangkok jail.  To tell any more would spoil a great story for you.

This really is one of Nicole's best performances.  She may have won an Oscar for ""The Hours"", but this mini-series truly shows why she is one of the greats.  Her character is so believable, that you feel the anguish and sorrow she is experiencing in that hellish jail.

The DVD can be difficult to locate in USA. Best advice is to obtain from Australia where it was recently released on DVD, although edited somewhat.  A must own!",1132099200,5,1243,4.613636363636363
8071959,4,B000A15GV2,"The plot is like one of the great Victorian novels, although mainly set in Australia and Thailand. It's not at all subtle, but with a storyline that takes in an illegitimate daughter, drug-smuggling, Japanese treatment of prisoners of war, and Thai executions of criminals, and Australian 1980s TV production values, what can you expect?

I have to say that this two-DVD set is a lot longer than the version I saw on the BBC in the early 1990s, which was broadcast over two evenings.

The other surprise for me is the fairly appalling synthesizer soundtrack. Clearly I had been so gripped by the storyline that I didn't notice the music on first viewing.

For most Britons, this was their first glimpse of Nicole Kidman. Even then, the ambition of the actress shone through.

And finally, I suspect that, if Bangkok Hilton hadn't been made, the plot of Bridget Jones Two would have taken a different turn.",1125619200,2,905,4.782051282051282
