5250783,2,B0092UK6SK,"Great series! The characters really make it. It's fun to watch and they have a great variety of personalities plus the series is full of fun moments, such as the Russian sushi chef who assures potential customers that his sushi rarely kills anyone.

I watched it online. Have been waiting over a year hoping I could buy a legit copy for my collection, but the distributors seem to be determined to deny their fans any chance to buy a reasonably priced set. I buy anime for $15-50 for a series with 13-26 episodes. If you do want to buy get it from rightstuf for less, but even there still out of line with the market.",1404604800,3,617,4.3652173913043475

8534902,5,B0092UK6SK,"Update: Durarara!! Series 2 is coming in January via online streaming sites!

The series is five stars for sure.  The basic premise is that a faerie spirit called a Dullahan (Irish and Celtic lore) goes to Ikebukuro to find her missing head. That's the short of it.  The long story is that this series has several arcs, a horde of interesting characters, and plenty of action, comedy, and drama.  It is a modern day 'shonen' style anime that is based VERY closely on the (also terrific) manga series which is based on the light novels, which I do not believe have been translated to English yet.

Mikado is a kid from the boondocks who is accepted to a decently good high school in Ikebukuro-Tokyo.  In real life Ikebukuro has notoriety in Japan as being a 'tough' neighborhood, but seedy is a more apt descriptor.  It does get a bad rap in several TV shows and anime series (kind of like NYC does if you watch a lot of Law and Order).  Mikado meets his childhood friend Masaomi and they rekindle an old friendship.  They speak of the people in the ward, and note the rumors of the 'Headless Rider'.

Throughout the series the viewer is treated to events that transpire in overlapping time.  One episode we might follow Mikado, in the next we might see Simon, Orihara, and Shizuo getting into a scuffle that occurred at the same time (and we might also have seen glimpses of in the previous episode).

The first arc follows Celty and her search for her missing head.  There are two main factions with Orihara using both as his pawns: Celty, Mikado, Shizuo, and the rest of the Ikebukuro youths; the other faction being the scientists (led by Namie Yagiri) and supported by Orihara and others.

The second arc revolves around the myth of the 'slasher' Saika.  The pharma folks are in the background and this arc mainly focuses on Mikado, Masaomi, and the other school age youths.  Celty is in this arc a bit, but she acts in a more supporting role. Orihara is still pulling strings.

The third arc revolves around the resurgence of the Yellow Scarves gang and their 'retired' leader.  This arc finishes the anime series and involves a lot of the previous characters coming together in minor roles.  The 'Saika' arc is actually resolved in this arc.

The best part about this series is the number of amazing characters.  Every viewer will have someone to root for.  Even the 'bad guys' have some redeeming qualities.  The music is pretty darn catchy, not just the intro and closing songs, but the in series music as well.  Animation is clean and crisp, keeping with the very crisp, thin lined style of the manga (which was produced before the anime but was based on the light novels).  Everything about this series is top notch, sadly the plot and story doesn't appeal to a broad range of anime fans in the states.  Those in Japan have more attachment to the series since this is based on a place that many Japanese are familiar with, especially those in and near Tokyo.

Bottom line: this is a must watch series.  Yes, the actual hard copies are expensive since there was only a limited run of DVDs and Blu-Rays pressed.  But the series is streaming on multiple legitimate sites like Crunchyroll (and Hulu Plus if I'm not mistaken), so you can pay the monthly service fee and watch it on those sites.  And don't forget about series 2 starting January 2015!",1416528000,3,3355,4.5993265993265995
