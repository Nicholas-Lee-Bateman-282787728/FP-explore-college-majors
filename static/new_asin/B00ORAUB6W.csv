6760079,5,B00ORAUB6W,Moving..........keeps your interest. The details through the acting are beautifully portrayed by the beautiful and capable actresses. Will enjoy over the coming years - re/connects to our innate compassion for one another.,1420243200,2,222,5.96875
6760080,4,B00ORAUB6W,"Uneven script that couldn't quite decide if it was a comedy or a serious piece. However, I gave it four stars because of two elements: 1. it was quite refreshing to see a movie with lesbian characters, where being a lesbian is not the be all and end all of the story, but rather just facets of the characters. The movie held more universality that way. and 2. the ultimate theme and message of the film was terrific and touching. Worth watching.",1426464000,2,445,4.439024390243903

6760092,5,B00ORAUB6W,"No doubt about it. This is definitely the "" Love Story"" ( Ryan O'Neal; Ali MacGraw. 1970) for lesbians! In French ( I believe) with English subtitles, the plot takes many twists and turns. The women encountering much homophobia from their families along the way.",1423440000,,262,4.844444444444444
6760093,5,B00ORAUB6W,Well acted movie.  Wonderful adventurous love story with a balance of comedy and saddness. Real life issues handled in a thought-provoking and sensitive way.,1422662400,,157,5.541666666666667
6760094,2,B00ORAUB6W,I was disappointed.  Most foreign films have a higher quality than American lesbian films but this was poorly edited and scripted.,1421625600,7,130,5.190476190476191
6760095,2,B00ORAUB6W,"**** In German with English Subtitles ****

To be fair, this had a sh!#ty beginning and a sh!#ty middle as well.

SPOILERS AHEAD.

Set in Germany, two women emerge from a convoluted opening, meet at a geriatric hospice, embark on an implausible mission (involving one stolen urn), and are severely disabled along the way due to ZERO chemistry and a CRAPPY script.  Then one dies.

Et tu, Germany?! wtf. Why are we still killing the lesbian off in the end??? It's 2015, people!!! Happy End is no more happier than Nicole Conn's A Perfect Ending... with the same stupid title. ooooo, so ironic. In this case, I think a bad translation is involved. pfft.

The only reason I didn't turn it off is because the blonde, Lucca (Sinha Melina Gierke), was so damn hot. Like, girl-next-door-waiting-to-be-corrupted hot.  With the right partner (i.e., ME), I could believe she was into women. The other, no lez vibe whatsoever... I don't think she ever changed her clothes and she looked old and haggard.... BECAUSE SHE HAD A BRAIN TUMOR!!!!!

So disappointed. Y'all had Sinha Melina Gierke at your bidding and killed it with a dull plot, the wrong partner, and no nudity or sex scenes (one implied). pfft.

Give me a call, Sinha.... we'll make home movies in my basement....",1421107200,26,1263,4.783410138248848
6760096,5,B00ORAUB6W,"a 5 star movie on the actresses in this movie.
I enjoy all movies international outside of this country.
People must look at this movie production in another country and they do things in different fashion
People don't have to take what I say but I look for a strong women in all movies and there relationships between the women.",1421020800,,329,4.5
6760097,3,B00ORAUB6W,"Boring and kind of predictable and a whole lotta uptight.  Maybe it's a German thing.  Tries to be deep with some of the conversations between the characters but isn't really imo.  I fast forwarded through parts of it and won't bother to watch it again.  BTW, one of the main characters dies at the end.  Surprise!  Well, not really.",1420934400,3,333,4.559322033898305

8684652,3,B00ORAUB6W,"It's not great, but it's charming. It made me laugh often. Part of the ending feels unnecessary. Poor editing and camera work.

There's what seems to be a transition kind of expressing time passing while driving, and it's artsy and that's great and all, but it was used over and over in the film unnecessarily.
There was also a scene of the father sticking his feet in the grass, and while charming, I felt it wasn't necessary to the film.

Kind of irritated with the ending, but I think the movie is funny.",1471219200,,507,4.440860215053763
