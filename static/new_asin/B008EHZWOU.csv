5153605,5,B008EHZWOU,"Admittedly, I was not expecting much from the movie. But it did indeed give me a hell of a ride! There are some slow moments. But in the end it would put you at the edge of your seat. The plot though, is not too clear for those who have not seen the series. For those not familiar with the series just sit back and enjoy the action! When I watched the movie I felt satisfied my money was well spent. Can't hardly wait for the Blu-ray realease and work out my home theater! A worthy Bourne addition to my collection!",1344470400,4,515,4.108910891089109
5153606,5,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Legacy does not feature Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne.  Instead a new agent, Aaron Cross played by Jeremy Renner, is introduced.  Aaron Cross is similar to Jason Bourne in many ways and there are hints that he is a genetically improved version of the agents that Treadstone created.  Rachel Weisz plays Cross' romantic interest, Edward Norton plays the main antagonist, and Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Albert Finney, and Scott Glenn return as Landy, Vosen, Hirsch and Kramer, respectively, all from previous Bourne installments.

The movie also attempts to tie in the previous Bourne movies and their plots into this installment.  Most interesting about this movie is that it builds on what we have learned in the last three movies, but promises that Jason Bourne was just the beginning and that the conspiracy is much larger than just the Treadstone project.

After Treadstone was revealed by Bourne and Landy at the end of the third movie the CIA and top government officials attempt to erase all traces of Operation Outcome which includes disposing of Aaron Cross.  Operation Outcome is similar to Treadstone in that it creates assassins but the main difference is that the Outcome agents are 'created' with the use of genetic modification.  The central plot of the movie revolves around Renner's character, Aaron Cross, as he attempts to find more pills to sustain his super strength, intellect and ability, while dodging men sent to eliminate him and other Outcome agents.

The movie itself started very slowly while they attempted to tie in everything from the last Bourne movie into this.  New scenes were inserted into Bourne film #3 to explain why the CIA was attempting to eliminate Project Outcome and then moves towards silencing Landy.  While it is much slower paced than the last Bourne film, the action scenes that were shown were amazing!  The rooftop chase was my favorite, and the ending seems much more carefree than the last three Bourne movies.  They also introduce LARX, another program where agents were genetically improved, and one of their agents goes after Cross.  Without any ties to Treadstone or Outcome, LARX seems to be given a free pass.  I wish more of that was explored or that the antagonist was harder to eliminate.  Hopefully there will be more to come!",1342483200,140,2311,5.010471204188482

I REALLY LIKE the original Bourne movies (well, not really # 4); and I like this one better than those (well, maybe not #1). They wove the story into the Treadstone/Blackbriar fabric very well, showed the creators of those programs moving on without concern once they were exposed with the new programs shown in this movie.

Jeremy Renner was very good as was Rachel Weisz; the action was not as frenetic as a couple of the main Bourne movies (a good thing); and the development of the love story was believable and the chemistry was good between the Renner and Weisz.",1527120000,,642,4.487179487179487

5153613,4,B008EHZWOU,"While it can't hold a candle to the previous trilogy featuring Matt Damon IMO, it was a lot better than I expected.

This is all the more clear now that I've unfortunately made the mistake of watching the last Jason Bourne, released in 2016 I think - which is quite simply one of the absolute worst movies in a successful franchise that I've ever had the misfortune of watching.

While I don't think Rachel Weisz is exactly the most amazing actress, she plays competently in this movie - and Jeremy Renner really does justice to the Jason Bourne character. Side characters were well cast/chosen to flesh out the storyline. I originally rented this movie but bought the DVD later.",1526688000,,679,4.697478991596639

5153676,4,B008EHZWOU,"So here's the thing:

I bought the blu ray a few months ago. I tried watching it but found the opening scenes too slow. So I kept setting it aside, figuring I'd watch it later.

I finally watched it tonight. The first 20 minutes or so were slow, like I remembered. Then the movie picked up steam. The story became interesting, and the action, more compelling. I became interested in the main characters, sympathetic, and invested in their survival. But then...

SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT

.... it all kind of fizzled.

The last ten minutes appeared to be building up to a battle between the protagonist and an equally lethal man without a conscience. The movie had set us up for a serious, desperate fight to the death.

It never happened.

It looked like it was about to. It started with a motorcycle chase. That's cool. But then the motorcycle chase went on. And on. And on. And on. One motorcycle chasing another. Our hero driving along trying to escape. (Ah, that's heroic.) The bad guy, who we never learned anything about except that he could ride a bike, chasing him.  For some reason the good guy had put his girlfriend on the back of the bike, and she kept almost falling off. (He should've just told her he'd meet her later.)

The chase seems like it lasted about 30 minutes. It may have only been 20. Seriously, though, it was a long, long, long, long scene of one guy on a motorcycle riding through the streets behind another guy and his girlfriend on another motorcycle. Weaving in and out of traffic. Ho hum. Then the bad guy crashes his bike, and wipes out, and is presumably killed. The end.

Here's what they should have done. Action movies need to involve the hero doing something more than running. If you're setting up for a fight, have the fight. What's his name, the hero, should have jumped on a bike and ridden off. The bad guy should have chased him, for a minute or so. (That's a long screen chase.) Then ditch the bikes and get down to business, a man-on-man fight, with the hero trying to convince the bad guy, between blows, to break his programming... and finally having to kill him to survive. That's an action movie ending. You're welcome.

In spite of the slow beginning and weak ending, I liked the movie, all in all. But it would have been much better if they'd axed the bike chase, and give us the battle it seemed to be leading up to. Hero emerges bloodied but triumphant. He tells the creeps who sent the killer that next time, he's coming for them. A proper action movie ending. A hero who does something besides spend the movie running.

Thanks and good night.",1507507200,,2658,4.526096033402923

The film spends no less than 30 minutes to an hour doing a ridiculous amount of plot setup, only to try and bring things together in an underwhelming series of chases that result in absolutely no story resolution. As the film ends, so many questions remain unanswered, and as a viewer you feel as if you were just strung along for far too long only to be disappointed with a sequel-bait finale.",1496016000,,619,4.486725663716814
5153716,4,B008EHZWOU,"This is one of the BEST Jason Bourne movies.  It was intelligent, exciting, and a very fun action movie to watch.

It is MUCH better than the latest Jason Bourne movie with Matt Damon.

It is an older movie, but is every bit as good, if not better, than the original Jason Bourne movies.

5153769,4,B008EHZWOU,"Tony Gilroy did a good job keeping the story going and placing this movie in the timeline of The Bourne Ultimatum. Legacy gives us some good background information as we see more of the web that makes up Treadstone.  Well, Treadstone is just a small part of the web of similar programs that continue to develop one after another.  I had some reservation about the movie as it was missing Matt Damon.  I expected the movie to be a good movie since it had Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is more than just a good movie - it's a good Bourne movie.  As I stated in my review of Jason Bourne, I actually like Legacy better.  Although with Legacy you get some back story that connects to Ultimatum, you can still watch it without having first seen the others.  You won't be lost, but it does make the movie more enjoyable seeing them in chronological order.  I like Renner's character.  It's interesting to see an agent/asset with personality.  If you love Bourne you will want to make this part of your collection.",1486339200,,1045,4.51063829787234

5153795,1,B008EHZWOU,"This was awful. I was watching it and wondering, did they have a contractual obligation or something that they had to make some sort of ""Bourne"" film and Matt Damon wasn't available at the time, so they cobbled together this turkey? In any case, it's more of the same: action hero runs around and does cool stuff - then abruptly we cut, over and over again, to a cold room filled with intelligent-sounding people talking about secret government things that got out of hand and needed to be stopped, using exciting-sounding technical code names and stuff (usually these are those windows to either get snacks or use the bathroom, as the inane dialog really does little to advance the shallow plot.) Jeremy Remmer just seems like Hawkeye on another top secret mission, and it was hard to get into his character at all (the opening Alaskan scenery and snow was nice though). This film is chock full of ""oh, it's that guy from..."" moments, and it took me awhile to figure out, ""oh, that's Po Dameron"", or ""oh, that's that Edward Whatisname"" or ""Oh man, is that Stacy Keach? He must be 800 years old!"" etc. None of them helped this turkey, especially not the beautiful but pointless scientist woman who really only seemed to be in this film to look really skinny. And what a dramatically anti-climatic final fight scene/chase scene/whatever that was. (Spoiler) Bad guy runs into a pole with his motorcycle and goes all rag-doll. And that's it I guess. What a mess.",1484006400,,1459,4.703125

It gave us a lot of information about how the Blackbriar program has changed. Loved the scene where he is being hunted by the missile armed drone. It's another one of my favorites. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, but it doesn't deserve 5 stars because I think the story almost seems like an offshoot of the Bourne movies, and almost a completely stand-alone movie...and while related to Bourne, it almost seems like it's not part of the same series...just related.

5153897,4,B008EHZWOU,"I was surprised and impressed at how good this was. The story is a spin-off of the original Jason Bourne stories and seems to be happening at the same time as events in the Bourne ultimatum. It has a good plot, good pacing, and a fine cast; I especially liked Renner and Weisz in the lead roles. The main character, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), is a member of a black ops program called Operation Outcome, whose subjects are genetically enhanced. He must run for his life once former CIA Treadstone agent Bourne's actions lead to the public exposure of Operations Treadstone and its successor Blackbriar. When the CIA learns of a potentially explosive video of Treadstone's and Outcome's medical directors socializing together, they decide to cut their losses and close down the programs until the political heat cools. They begin assassinating the agents and scientists associated with the programs.  At a biogenetics company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite (eljko Ivanek) shoots and kills all but one of his colleagues in the research laboratory. Security guards break into the lab and shoot him, though he seemingly does not feel the pain of the gunshots. Foite turns his gun on himself, leaving biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as the sole survivor. Agents later attempt to stage her suicide, but are stopped by Cross, who had tracked her down to help him acquire the chemicals he needs to retain his enhanced physical and mental conditioning. The two work together to save themselves.",1477094400,9,1517,5.043824701195219

5153899,5,B008EHZWOU,very good movie,1477008000,,15,4.333333333333333
5153900,4,B008EHZWOU,"They have done excellent, often distasteful, work for the U.S. government but when a British reporter and a sharp CIA supervisor start to discover the truth about former assassin Jason Bourne and his cohorts - some of whom have been genetically modified - the officials behind their highly illegal black ops programs decide they have to go.
And that doesn't mean they're going to be allowed to retire and move to Miami.
Enter Aaron Cross, a man whose IQ was so low an Army recruiter had to fudge his score in order to allow him to enlist. Wounded in action, he is whisked away to a secret location where he undergoes radical gene therapy and behavior modification. When he emerges his IQ has been artificially boosted and his body modified. The result: He is smarter, stronger, and faster than the average human being. Banished to a remote Alaskan camp because he questioned a decision made by a superior officer, he treks to another camp in search of the medications he needs to remain who he is. Without those medications, he will revert back to the man he was when he first enlisted. When he meets up with another operative in search of those meds he finds himself under attack by the very people he works for.
""The Bourne Legacy"" takes place at the same point in time that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" does. While Bourne is doing his level best to expose the black ops programs that have been run under the auspices of the CIA and other covert agencies, Cross is just trying to survive long enough to find out who wants him dead and why. That leads him to a beautiful doctor who has helped to monitor him over the years and therein hangs a tale.
""Legacy"" is a very good movie with nice performances by Jeremy Renner as Cross, Rachel Weisz as the doctor, and Edward Norton as the man who is desperately trying to cover up the black ops programs by ""burning them to the ground."" Imbued with a deep sense of entitlement and a false sense of patriotism, Norton's character goes about the business of killing off the men and women he has used in the past with ruthless efficiency.
The plot is fairly straightforward: This is, at its heart, a chase movie and it covers a lot of territory in the telling. Starting in Alaska, it moves to New York, London, Washington, parts of Virginia and eventually to the Philippines. The action seldom stops and is highlighted by a great motorcycle chase through Manila toward the end of the movie. Renner, who has made his mark in action franchises ranging from ""The Avengers"" to ""Mission: Impossible"" is believable as Cross and Weisz comes across nicely as the doctor. Norton is chilling as the man charged with covering up the whole mess.
The cinematography is first rate and there are some very nice portrayals of secondary characters by Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, and others. If I have a criticism of this movie it's that I wanted (needed?) to know more about the doctor's history. We know she is smart, we know that she lives alone because a former boyfriend left her months ago, but we don't know much more than that. She is central to this movie and yet she remains almost more of a mystery than Cross.
That said, this is a really fun flick and worth every bit of 4.5 stars.",1477008000,,3207,4.559792027729636

Absolutely superb acting, solid storyline, fast believeable action, solid development beyond Bourne arc, some of the best chase scenes on film, don't understand why lots of ""it's not Bourne"" sentiment floating around. Thought this was a perfect addition, after repeated (at least 12) viewings I could not find one part of this movie out of place or poorly done. Aaron is just as capable as Jason. The motorcycle chase is on par with the prior series Moscow and Paris car chases.

My only beef is Aaron and Hawkeye seem to be twin brothers, maybe Aaron got recruited by Nick Furey post med viral out session. Black Widow may be a product from Russia's answer to Treadstone.",1476489600,,688,4.822033898305085

One of the agents also escapes his murder on a test site, and returns in time to rescue the scientist. They escape and the action starts in earnest. Although it was an enjoyable movie, it still wasn't Jason Bourne, and yes I did understand this is merely his ""legacy"", but I would have preferred another Bourne movie and not an imitator. Even the killer they send after him doesn't come across as a true threat. He arrives, there is a chase, and he's done for.

Loved the Matt Damon movies, and this parallel story starring Jeremy Renner (Hawk from the Avenger movies) does not disappoint. While the series has become formulaic, Bourne Legacy is somewhat unique in that the main character is just looking to survive, so it doesn't slow to ponder the morality of secret, government agencies or endlessly show angst-filled flashbacks (though there are a few).

It is all about Aaron Cross. This is a movie with a lot of storytelling; which I favor over pure action.  Then, when Aaron and Marta finally team up, oh how I loved the subtly of their interactions as they became more and more to each other. (Well done, director and actors!) This entire movie is so well acted, even by the minor characters, that I enjoyed every personality that came on screen.  I like a good story, and I like romance in my movies. I also like how Aaron is the one who knows how to protect Marta (love the action scenes), but that she is a full participant in helping how she can in their quest, and she is a smart and resourceful woman.  Their partnership/attraction for each other (and Aaron protecting her, albeit out of self interest at first) is why I have watched this movie a few times now.  The story and action is well done and interesting and new for me, but the ""love story"" is why I re-watch it.",1472774400,19,1092,4.307317073170732

The director doesn't do a good job of letting you know when they are flashing back to a previous time so you have to see the Bourne Ultimatum to know when they're doing that.,1471219200,,502,4.351063829787234

5154035,4,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Legacy
 For action fans like me this film is a great treat.  It has everything we could want in terms of story, direction and excellent acting from a cast that includes plenty of famous names.  And there is a chase scene at the end that is beyond spectacular.  For once the director spent his enormous special effect budget on creating thrills rather than simply wrecking the highest possible number of cars or creating the grandest possible explosions.  For pure scariness there is nothing like a 20 minute high speed motorcycle ride through Manila with everybody in the world chasing you.
 Director Tony Gilroy has in a way brought his own vision to the screen.  He wrote the script with his brother Dan-who also wrote last years fighting robot epic Real Steel.  Brother Tony directed the very well received Michael Clayton and the entertaining if not spectacular Duplicity.  But Tony also wrote all three of the previous Bourne films.  This one picks up the story line a couple of weeks after the end of the last Bourne film, but with a new agent/victim and a different but parallel program.
 The bad guys once again are overly ambitious members of the US intelligence community.  There are lots of real bad guys out in the real world but Hollywood always seems to prefer imaginary American bad guys.  If our intelligence community really had the fantastic capabilities to find and track illusive targets that are depicted in the movie, there would be no problems with bad actors anywhere.  Imaginary or not it is fun to watch the high tech geeks electronically chase the almost super hero status rogue agent.  Cool, fast and fun I say.
 In case there is some one out in movie land that hasn't gotten the word, Jeremy Renner is a full blown movie star and an action hero of the first rank.  We have seen him enough lately to know the guy can act but Legacy proves that he can carry a top of the line major Hollywood production.  Edward Norton has his usual intensity dialed back to mere total dedication to his job, finding the perfect pitch for his character.  Albert Finney, Scott Glen and Stacy Keach  are included in the famous supporting players.  All of them turn in top notch performances.  Rachel Weisz plays the brave, game, terrified scientist that gets swept up in the vile machinery of a high level science-intelligence project that has gone very wrong indeed.
 We must give special snaps to cinematographer Robert Elswit and film editor John Gilroy.  Between the two of them they film and patch together one of the most exciting chases since Bullet.
 This four saw blade action flick runs two hours and 15 minutes.  It will be big enough to justify its $125 million budget and still turn a huge profit for all involved.  People will love this movie.  It is rated PG-13 for scads of violence but no naked people.

5154069,2,B008EHZWOU,"While the last events of The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) are playing out, this side story is happening. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is on a training exercise in the Alaskan wilderness while the heads of spy-dom in Washington, D.C., are scrambling to contain the potential fallout from Jason Bourne's story going public. That means they need to shut down Treadstone, the program associated with Bourne, and any other related programs that can be traced from Treadstone. Cross's program can be linked to Treadstone, so they have to eliminate all those field agents. They fail to knock off Cross; they almost succeed in wiping out the lab that processed the agents. One doctor, Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), survives. She has enough information that the spy-dom folks try again to eliminate her, but by this time Cross has made it back to the D.C. area and saves her. They go on the run. She just wants to survive. He needs the drugs they've been using to enhance his abilities. The pills are manufactured in Manilla, so a world-wide chase is on.

The movie starts off slowly. Cross is wandering through Alaska for no apparent reason other than to showcase some impressive stunts and introduce the blue and green pills that make him better. Intercut with this is Col. Byer (Edward Norton) convincing everyone to shut down Treadstone and its progeny, another slow moving process. The action picks up when they try to kill Cross with a drone strike. All of the spy plotting and behind-the-scenes machinations are less believable and less interesting than the action sequences. The final chase in Manilla is the star of the movie. Renner and Norton give good performances but their characters are not as compelling as previous heroes and villains in the Bourne films.

Good as an action film (though there isn't quite enough action to make it a great action film) and underwhelming as a spy/conspiracy thriller.",1468886400,,1902,4.940625

There was a lot of hype because it was a ""Bourne"" movie but unfortunately it didn't have the Bourne feel to it.  It was less about finding out something that happened (the spy aspect) and more about making sure Jeremy Renner's character found the drugs he needed to survive.

5154138,5,B008EHZWOU,"Tony Gilroy puts together a smart movie with thrilling scenes in an intelligent script.  Greengrass, the director to numbers 2 and 3, does a fair job with those, but this one is superior in story and execution.  Jeremy Renner admittedly doesn't have Damon's range, but the story and Weise as support make up for his deficits.  What I couldn't stand with Greengrass' direction, was the silly plot devices he allowed, like a safe in a high secure building being defeated by Bourne looking through a window with a monocular in an adjacent building, or Bourne for no reason giving away his location, or him somehow escaping an 'interrogation room' by crashing through a window for crying out loud.  This one is smarter, scarier, better.  And the fight scenes weren't just manic, camera shaking spasm-fests.  Still, I'll watch the next Bourne movie, but wish Gilroy had the reigns of that one too.

No one in this movie comes up to that standard. I think this was bad casting all the way around.

5154173,5,B008EHZWOU,Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz did a fantastic job.  This Bourne was at least as good as the second and third in the series. The direction was good.  I think it didn't do as well as the others because it was too believable.,1459209600,,223,4.162790697674419
5154174,1,B008EHZWOU,Digitally i could get a copy on itunes and VUDU. This studio is doing the right thing that allows me to watch the movie and not have to juggle 600 apps on where i need to watch the movie.  If i own the movie i should also receive a digital copy on any provider i want similar to disney movies anywhere for all studios.

5154192,4,B008EHZWOU,"Jeremy Renner when he is allowed to act he turns into a great actor.  Unlike in the Mission Impossible movies where he is totally subordinate to Tom Cruise, in Bourne Legacy he shines as a great star.  The only problem is the movie studios in Hollywood are
more enamoured with Matt Damon as Bourne then Jeremy.  Thus what could have become a great series with Rachel Weisz
and other actors like the CIA bosses in the movie seems to have been put on the backburner.  However the pulsating energy of
Bourne Legacy is unquestionable.  The climax is somewhat anti climatic but the ongoing fast paced dialogue and the rapid
movement of ideas, expressions and a great script make for an unbelievable movie.  Even the settings in Alaska and Maryland
are well shot.  They are dramatic and unusual.  If only there was a Bourne Legacy II in this decade.",1456617600,,843,4.648648648648648

Rather than a story line the resolves, it seemed more of a setup for the next chapter in the Series, which I'm sure I will also watch.

Certainly a movie worth seeing, but not quite up to the standard of the first three in the original Bourne Series.",1455580800,,411,4.1375

5154232,5,B008EHZWOU,"For me, this is not only the best of the Bourne movies, it is tied at the top with maybe 5-10 others as a best ever action movie. For starters, this movie would not have been possible without the previous 3 other, great Bourne films.
Complex, but very smart and intelligent storyline, dialog, and incredible acting.  The most important aspect for me, is that it has an incredible amount of realism and believability, once you accept the basic premise. I love the commentary on the DVD, and the deleted scenes.
Hard for me to understand, why this one is liked so much less, but I think the complexity, and the 'explaining' are a turnoff to a lot of the audience; and they talk about this in the commentary. They mention all the cases where the explained stuff, and places where they choose not to. For me,  the 'explaining' is a very important part of creating believability.

5154257,2,B008EHZWOU,"I'd watched a couple of the earlier Bourne movies before this one, so assumed this one would be just as entertaining. I was wrong.

Let me use an analogy:
Imagine you've tried a great chocolate cake at a restaurant. A week later, you're craving that chocolate cake. You remember its richness and sweetness, and your mouth waters. You pass by a restaurant of the same name, so you decide to stop by. You're fearful that they may not serve chocolate cake, but lo and behold! There it is, on the menu! You order the cake, and once it arrives, something is just a little off. You notice the shape of the cake is different, but you put your fork into it anyway. Then you notice the texture is much more dense than you remember. You take a bite of the chocolate cake, and the taste is off...yes, it's still sweet, but you discover they've substituted Sweet N Low for sugar and canola oil for butter and corn meal in lieu of flour...and...and...it's just not the same cake, but at least it's still chocolate (maybe)...!

This movie was like that weird chocolate cake. It might have been better, if I had not been expecting something more rich and satisfying.

Hopefully, the next movie will be as good as the previous ones.",1447286400,,1216,4.5181818181818185
5154258,4,B008EHZWOU,Great conclusion to series!,1447200000,,27,6.0
5154259,3,B008EHZWOU,"It just so happened that the movie I watched on DVD prior to this one was ""Enemy at the Gates,"" which also featured Rachel Weisz.  She is an actress I find appealing to watch, for she credibly communicates intelligence as well as intensity, and here, as a biologist with expertise in genetics she sounds as credible as she needs to when discussing the (fictional) phenomenon of ""viraling out.""  You'll have to watch the movie to find out what that means!  If you do so, you'll get caught up, as with the earlier ""Bourne"" movies, in CIA skulduggery -- generally, an intelligence operation that is carried on as far as possible beyond the ken of the people or their elected officials.  The Bourne series (of which this is the fourth), has been all about keeping the lid on wider knowledge of what is clearly a rogue operation.  In this movie Edward Norton is the chief rogue, and Jeremy Renner plays Aaron Cross, a Bourne surrogate (Matt Damon having bowed out) and an operative who, like Bourne in the first movie, is out to discover just what his employers have done to him.  It involves genetic tampering, hence the presence of Rachel Weisz, who also, she claims (and we believe her because she's Rachel Weisz), doesn't fully know the extent of the nefarious uses to which her research has been put.

When Norton realizes that Renner's character is looking for answers, he decides to eliminate him.  Easier said than done, of course -- and the chase is on -- at which point this movie becomes like all the others, a chase-movie.  Cars, planes, boats and motorcycles all feature, and the locale for the climax this time is Manila, and the final chase seems a partial homage to ""Terminator 2.""  That's all that needs to be said.  Renner is as effective as Damon was as a hunted man and, bearded, looks remarkably like the young Kenneth Branagh. Weisz is fine as the biologist who helps him, and Ed Norton is suitably chilly -- but this is a movie that doesn't really call for the full deployment of acting skills that Renner, Norton, or Weisz are capable of.  The same was true of Damon, of course.  The bottom line is -- if you like fast chases and exotic locales, go for it.  It's smoothly done.  My own tolerance for this stuff is limited, so I tend to think it's maybe time to put this franchise out to pasture (excuse the incoherent metaphor!).",1447200000,,2348,4.583732057416268

5154282,5,B008EHZWOU,"This is a great action movie with memorable and exceptional sequences:  the beginning in Alaska with Oscar Isaac and the wolves;  the incident in the lab;  at the doctor's (played by Rachel Weisz) house;  the factory in Manila and big chase scenes in Manila.

The movie is haunted by the previous Bourne movie and a few images from it are repeated for effect/continuity in 'Legacy'.  Jeremy Renner works well as Agent Aaron Cross (who has a resonant backstory that contributes to the urgency of the movie's plot) and Rachel Weisz is a pleasure to watch.",1445558400,,553,4.768421052631579

5154314,4,B008EHZWOU,A pretty good spy thriller with an interesting twist to possibly continue the Bourne theme of a government agency gone wacko now creating a new type of super spy. My only quibble is that the plot gets hijacked in favor of much too long car chase themes. Good Camera work/editing for the chase scenes.,1441497600,,300,4.574074074074074

5154326,5,B008EHZWOU,This is one of the best movies in the series. It seems more real and  with stellar performances by Jeremy Renner  and Rachael Weisz . This is the most realistic senario of government interference/control of the three movies.,1440547200,,224,4.868421052631579

Matt Damon was so perfect as Bourne that I had a hard time thinking they could take the Bourne story in a new direction.

Greengrass at the helm.

Jeremy Renner, while in far better shape than myself, is slightly chubby to be playing a human killing machine. Rachel Weisz on the other hand is so skinny I didn't even recognize her until the end credits rolled, although her ubiquity in international thrillers playing the ""very upset lady"" should have been a tip off.

Beautifully shot in lots of far flung locations, which I guess would explain the lack of funding for a proper script. But hey, who's to argue with what two 12 years olds on a Red Bull bender can come up with given the time and a professional transcription service.

But, notwithstanding my concerns, the Bourne Legacy turned out to be very entertaining. Like the other three Bourne films there is constant action. Also, this film had the able assistance of Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton as well as several other solid supporting actors. If you see it, keep your expectations to a minimum and they will be surpassed. This is a film you can see more than once and enjoy because there's so much going on in the action scenes, you pick up new details each time you watch.",1436659200,3,667,4.61344537815126

Matt Damon's too intense, Jeremy nails the part with vulnerability and humor that's lacking in the Damon versions.  I think he did a great job.

5154416,3,B008EHZWOU,"Whats it about?

An expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlums novels centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.

What did I think?

The Bourne Legacy is an oddly flat addition to the franchise. It has an interesting enough story and indeed the first act is set during the first Bourne movie. But even that provides some jarring moments and simply makes you wish youd re-watched the original before you sat down.

The characters are likeable and Jeremy Renner and Ed Norton put in very good performances, but the action sequences are a little lacking especially when compared to the outrageously frenetic fight scenes weve previously seen. Unfair comparison? Possibly, but it is quite a contrast.

Its good enough to warrant a continuation of the series  and doesnt rule out a return of Damon  but its simply entertaining without reaching any great heights.",1431734400,,916,4.909090909090909

5154504,5,B008EHZWOU,"THE BOURNE LEGACY and Jeremy Renner are brilliant. This film takes getting used to. This film is slow and methodical to the point that the viewer actually begins to lose interest in the details, but on repeated viewings there is more than meets the eye and it all pays off. THE BOURNE LEGACY picks up the pace and brings a lot of pieces together to what I imagined to be an explosive finale of drama and heroics and discovery of who is who in this complex film. But, that never happens. The film ends in a wrap up of events to this film and to elements of the series, but there may be more coming.  This film had a good idea and the filmmakers really pull it off. Basically, this film has a very interesting and almost intellectual narrative flow that it so incredibly conceived to entertain and draw the viewer in. Jeremy Renner gives an interesting and something of a heartfelt performance and adds a lot of back-story to the film and series. My expectations were high and this film surpassed them. THE BOURNE LEGACY is incredible film making.",1424822400,,1045,4.5

At least this was an original story and very likeable and compelling characters. The action was exciting. I liked the subtle attraction between Aaron and Marta that appears towards the end. I liked that the relationship was not contrived and seemed to develop naturally from their helping each other like the scene where he is sick and she is taking care of him and the motorcycle crash scene where they take each other's hand and don't let go even when holding on seemed awkward. It was sweet. Jeremy Renner is a fabulous action lead. I hope he makes more action movies. And Rachel Weisz is always excellent in anything.",1422230400,,772,4.6838235294117645

5154551,1,B008EHZWOU,"First off: I'm giving one stars because Jeremy Renner and Ed Norton are both very likeable actors and you could put them in anything. Also, Amazon doesn't have a zero.

Second: the rest of this review is pretty much spoilers. But that's okay, because you don't want to waste your time watching this movie. You'll thank me.

The beginning of the movie is engaging enough. Jeremy Renner gets to be a superhuman survival guy, and then his program turns against him, but he survives. He wrestles a wolf (?!) and puts a tracking device in it, which might be clever if it weren't exploded by a missile less than 5 seconds later. Why not just... drop it in the river?

Anyway. Then he's off to get his meds from the source. But that doesn't work out. Luckily, one of the scientists is _too pretty to die_, and she turns out to be just the one he needs for help.

And then we're off to the Philippines for what feels like a two-hour motorcycle chase. The chasee is the product of another secret operation -- this time, they've made them without that human empathy flaw. That might be smart for the evil shadow government, but is pretty stupid for a movie plot, because this character is now less interesting or fleshed out than a robot. Oh, and Renner's character is supposed to be sick and helpless because of the meds thing, but, don't worry, that only lasts until plenty of time to not matter at all. So all they have to do is run on rooftops for no very good reason, and then the motorcycle chase.

I guess some credit goes to the fact that the (okay, seriously, here's the end coming up, so if for some reason you don't want to be saved, stop now) female scientist somehow learns motorcycle ninja tricks and kicks the bad guy to his apparent doom while Renner drives. Then they crash too, and unlike the bad guy, who we never see again and have to assume is gone, they're just fine. And then the movie ends. (They're on a boat, because Renner stole a watch and that's all it takes for Filipino boat captains to not ask any questions, it seems.)

There. The end. Did you expect Edward Norton to somehow get involved, and the two storylines to come together? No. That doesn't happen. That's just off on its own like some kind of tedious behind-the-scenes with _more_ characters you won't care about.

Don't watch this. I ended up getting a terrible stomach bug the day after I watched this (for presumably unrelated reasons), and looking back, I enjoyed the stomach bug more.",1421971200,,2470,4.487750556792873
5154552,5,B008EHZWOU,"Took no time getting this delivered to me. It was a good movie, though it kinda started off slow. I love the Bourne movies and needed this one to complete the collection.",1421971200,,170,4.34375
5154553,5,B008EHZWOU,"One of my favorite movies EVER!  Incredibly good storyline interwoven around the other Bourne movies and taking the entire series to a new level.  Excellent cast.  Jeremy Reemer is outstanding.  And Ed Norton is nothing short of perfect for this role. Plenty of action, great cinematography and soundtrack.  I have watched it 20 times - it is that good.",1421884800,,353,4.915254237288136

5154561,4,B008EHZWOU,"We were all set to be disappointed by this `bandwagon' sequel, especially as Jeremy Renner (the unedifying `Hurt Locker' and mumble-vision `The Town') had the lead role. Happily, however, we were completely wrong. The shadowy world of the Treadstone and Black Briar conspiracies are joined by the even shadier Outcome project as the prime movers try to shut down their operations before the full story breaks in the media (leaked by Pamela Landy in the last film). The plotting and narrative pace is easily as taut as the previous films in the series which really comes as no surprise given that Tony Gilroy was also a member of the screenwriting team for the previous movies. The film does not suffer from the absence of Matt D (although a cameo appearance would have been nice) as Jeremy Renner is surprisingly good as the renegade Outcome operative Aaron Cross. The plot is nowhere near as complex as the earlier films and there's very little of the ""who's side is he on"" complication beloved of the conspiracy thriller genre but the action just piles along at a relentless pace culminating with probably the best chase sequence ever. An all-round excellent film but with the emphasis on action rather than twisty-turny plot lines it isn't quite in the same class as its predecessors.",1421452800,,1287,4.8812785388127855

5154614,4,B008EHZWOU,The movie was good but seems like a stretch to be considered part of the Bourne movies.  Jeremy Renner is a great actor but Matt Damon somehow made those movies more BA.

5154649,5,B008EHZWOU,Was surprised at how good this sequel was given that Matt Damon isn't in it. Jeremy Renner does an admirable job in the lead role. The speed of plot development and Weisz' very believable disbelief and disorientation draw the viewer into her dilemma. Her relationship with Renner's character doesn't become romantic until the end which pleased me. The only predictable aspect is the ongoing dirty dealings of the Treadstone/Blackbriar program personnel. Even so was on the edge of my seat until the last scene. Gripping and intense.,1416528000,,532,5.126436781609195

5154659,5,B008EHZWOU,"THE BOURNE LEGACY and Jeremy Renner are brilliant. This film takes getting used to. This film is slow and methodical to the point that the viewer actually begins to lose interest in the details, but on repeated viewings there is more than meets the eye and it all pays off. THE BOURNE LEGACY picks up the pace and brings a lot of pieces together to what I imagined to be an explosive finale of drama and heroics and discovery of who is who in this complex film. But, that never happens. The film ends in a wrap up of events to this film and to elements of the series, but there may be more coming.  This film had a good idea and the filmmakers really pull it off. Basically, this film has a very interesting and almost intellectual narrative flow that it so incredibly conceived to entertain and draw the viewer in. Jeremy Renner gives an interesting and something of a heartfelt performance and adds a lot of back-story to the film and series. My expectations were high and this film surpassed them. THE BOURNE LEGACY is incredible film making.",1414972800,,1045,4.5

5154669,5,B008EHZWOU,"I enjoy the Ludlum based movies.  Each got better and the Bourne Ultimatum seemed to make some great action breakthroughs which other movies seemed to imitate.  Some TV movies have broke their monotony with Bourne based action.  For me these movies seem to place the issue of democracy in our face.  In a grim sense these movies are serious, the issue of where our surveillance agencies belong is brought into sharp focus as agents that work for the agency get killed, surveillance skills are displayed and used on almost anyone the agency has reason  to spy on or arrange for harm or killing.  One constantly gets the feeling that our Constitution is all hot air and that surveillance is above the law.  Snowden has raised these issues into high gear and cases like:
https://archive.org/details/NsaTransmissionsElfMindControlCancerCorruptions_4

It is too bad Matt D. has stayed out of the 4th movie, we got addicted to him and so we get withdrawals from his absence.  Jeremy Renner is a great actor too and does a great job in the 4th movie.  He has full memory at work though he is dependent on his medication.  Norton has the unpleasant job of deciding to destroy Jeremy's group from top to bottom and also using surveillance on Landy as she defends herself in court.  The politicians who work with Rick(Norton) seem to take orders from the agency and undertake projects that require political approval without the politicians approval. So the Ludlum movies as edited by the movie directors, raise the question about surveillance and the legality of their actions in a democratic society?  The movies portray the agencies as some kind of corporative gangsters.  Despite these serious issues, I like the movies as entertainment and they sell for a good reason.",1414454400,,1763,4.972696245733788
5154670,5,B008EHZWOU,"a fantastic yet believable story..........  entertainment at its best...............  I liked the first Bourne movies but this was a step up.

5154671,4,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Legacy I watched with an open mind after owning the first three Bourne movies.  The movie itself started off slow to give people enough background on putting everything together for those who don't know about the Bourne movies.  Once you get past the 30 minute mark you have mutiple action scenes one after another which made me go yeah this is amazing.  The three main actors Jeremy, Rachel, and Edward gave soem of the single best preformances of their lives.  Edward's best since American History X, Jeremy since Hurt Locket so on and so forth.  Also as for action scnes the scene that made me watch the scene so closely was the motorcycle scene like a classic cat and mouse chase good guy vs bad guy.  Now those who know the Bourne movies pretty well don't expect Bourne to be in this movie just his name mention.  Like some other people wrote reviews for Amazon either you enjoy the movie or you don't, but from my point of view it truly does stand on it's own and I won't ruin it for other fans of the series but might be another movie for the series but watch this movie to see for yourself what I mean by that statment, for your a big fan of action movies with lots of gun fights, stuff blowing up, good guy vs bad guy chase scenes in small areas so forth pick this movie up for your collection.",1414281600,,1314,4.317073170731708

5154687,4,B008EHZWOU,"Script is predictable, but Renner's interpretation makes it believable.  His expressiveness is subtle and charming - a good choice to carry the Bourne torch after Matt Damon.  He needs more opportunity to show that he is a real actor, but it is difficult to break out of the hero-mold in Hollywood.  Awesome stunts and special effects (of course) and it's good to see the spirit of J. Edgar Hoover alive and well ""(government should operate in secret and control should belong only to those in the privileged upper class"") but female protagonist is a complete disappointment. A pretty woman being cast as a scientist is fine, but she needs to be more than eye candy.  There was nothing in the script to indicate that she was any more intelligent than a high school biology student and the damsel-in-distress schtick is overdone.  Script writers have plenty of templates for the hooks that make a female character irresistible.  Bella was a fluke - stick with the traits of Buffy, Bones and Bristow.",1413504000,,998,4.841176470588235
5154688,5,B008EHZWOU,"I seem to never get tired to this series and Blu-ray is the only way to go.  When I need to action, one of the Bourne films is always great to watch since I bought the whole series of films at once with the latest one.  And on another note,  I don't like the UltraViolet cloud storage of films and never use it.  I tried it once and I keep asking myself ""Why do I really need it?""  It takes too much work to log into the account and the movie then has to stream and if the connection is not as good as it should be which is too often, the film looks bad and is no fun to watch at all.  This is also my opinion for trying many streaming services.  Netflix stream has really improved in the past year but if I were to compare the quality in viewing of streaming vs Blu-ray the disc would win every time.",1413504000,,801,3.9074074074074074

I read a review that stated this isn't really a continuation of the 1st 3.  Nonetheless,  I found it to be an adrenaline rush, riveting, hold your breath type of film.  I think it would be worth buying just this installment since it's not really a true sequel; but I had to have the entire set.  Granted I haven't seen the 1st 3 either but I heard they're really fascinating.  It won't hurt to check them out.",1411257600,,586,4.321100917431193

5154727,4,B008EHZWOU,"My wife and I both agree this is the best of the Bourne movies. This character is much more engaging and interesting (Rachel Weisz is a great compliment) than Matt Damon's character. The Jason Bourne character always, to me, came off as a bit too plastic, as though they were trying just a bit too hard to make him ""overly super"". This story and the characters' struggles are much more personal and you feel more empathy for him.

Get the blu-Ray if you can. High definition of some of the scenery is simply awe-inspiring.

The only thing keeping it from five stars was one of the chase scenes that felt overly drawn out.",1411084800,,621,4.486725663716814

5154756,2,B008EHZWOU,"My husband and I are big fans of the Bourne movies but this movie was a disappointment, to put it mildly. I think much of it can be attributed to a lack of Matt Damon. He really is perfect for this kind of role, where Jeremy Renner takes it into the hyper-masculinized, polished Hollywood direction that Damon skillfully avoids. The other movies in the Bourne series have included adrenaline-laced, unique and expertly choreographed fight scenes, whereas this one does not. And the climax at the end is about as predictable and self-aware as they get. However, worst of all is the endless stream of mysterious acronyms and confusing context, upon which the storyline depends heavily, but assumes the viewer will piece together. Overall, I was very disappointed.",1409529600,,761,5.0

5154780,5,B008EHZWOU,"I love this addition to the Bourne series, but I'm not going to review the movie itself. That's what IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and a bunch of other sites are for. I'm also not going to talk about the Blu-Ray's picture quality and sound. Both seemed terrific to me, but I don't have a fancy AV set-up and I'm not an AV aficionado.

I purchase DVDs/Blu-Rays, not just to watch the movies over again, but also for the extras, particularly commentary tracks, because I like hearing about the process of filmmaking. The commentary for The Bourne Legacy is one of the best I've heard -- informative and interesting. The track features six people -- director and co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer (and Tony's brother) Dan Gilroy, editor (and Tony's and Dan's other brother) John Gilroy, Robert Elswit (director of photography), Kevin Thompson (production designer), and Dan Bradley (second unit director).

While it can be hard to tell who's speaking at times during the commentary (hint: most of the time, it's Tony Gilroy), it doesn't really matter. The commentary covers most aspects of filmmaking, from writing the script to casting to location scouting to creation of sets to the actual filming. The filmmakers break down how key scenes were put together, melding shots from different locations filmed at different times into one. Tony Gilroy discusses his personal rules -- he doesn't believe in rehearsals; for the Bourne films, all shots should be from a character's point of view. All of the speakers are very complimentary of everyone else involved, so there's very little ""dirt,"" but they do talk about difficulties they encounter -- bad weather, running out of daylight, locations not being available, actors simply being in the wrong mood for a scene. With six people on the commentary track, it's amazing that they don't talk over one another and that the narration is so coherent.

The Bourne Legacy's commentary track is a lesson in how a big-budget film is made and an eye-opening look at how complicated and expensive the process can be. Even as the commentary reveals how so many tricks are accomplished, it made me appreciate the ""magic"" of filmmaking even more.",1408492800,,2171,4.99171270718232
5154781,5,B008EHZWOU,"I purchased this movie from Amazon for $7.00 and a bluray/ digital copy/ ultraviolet copy was included. For that price, I highly recommend this package.
The Bourne Legacy is an exciting movie that takes place soon after the events of the Bourne Trilogy movies. Jeremy Renner plays agent Aaron Cross, who has been genetically manipulated and enhanced through the use of experimental drugs. The agents in this program, known only by their number, are constantly assessed for response to the chemicals which require daily maintenance doses.
As a result of Jason Bourne's actions, the agency, now under intense scrutiny, has elected to shut the program down. The agents involved in the program, who will die if not properly cycled off the meds, are considered collateral damage. The movie is essentially about Cross dealing with the sudden loss of medication, as well as being a target for reasons he doesn't understand. Rachel Weisz plays a scientist involved in the program who becomes Cross's unlikely ally. Ed Norton plays the CIA boss in charge of shutting it all down and leaving no loose ends.
I didn't think this movie had the intensity of the original Bourne movies but, I still really enjoyed it. It is fast paced, well written and well acted.",1408492800,3,1249,4.9523809523809526

5154829,3,B008EHZWOU,"I thought is was decent, though I don't really feel it tied into the rest of the series very well. At one point they mention Jason Bourne is in in the city again and it looks as if they are going to go after him, and they cut the scene there and never go back to it. It's almost like the in-movie timing is at the same time of the the prior movie, though that wasn't very consistent either. Decent movie, but if you want to make sense of it, disregard the fact that it is part of a series, treat it as its own entity as you watch.",1406246400,,530,3.871559633027523

5154833,4,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Legacy features Aaron Cross,a member of Operation Outcome that tries to escape the people who is trying to eradicate him thereby recreating and continuing the legacy that Jason Bourne left. This happens when US Defense Department black ops program who tries to prevent from Operation Outcome being exposed after Operations Threadstone and Blackbier has become known to the public.

It is by no means a bad film despite the fact that it does not manage to live up to the legacy left by both Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon who collaborated on the Bourne Trilogy. One may find this film poor when compared to the three previous great films considering that Aaron Cross isn't as mysterious and intriguing as Jason Bourne,Jeremy Renner isn't as talented as Matt Damon and the screenplay isn't as compelling as the films in the trilogy. While it may not be a great film with the reasons stated above,I feel that it would be unfair to categorize it a s a poor film. As a stand alone,it is well-written and an entertaining action film that could be considered a good but not great addition to that Bourne franchise.",1406073600,,1118,4.762886597938144

5154871,3,B008EHZWOU,"Better than expected.

First of all, casting an actual male in the lead is progress. Matt Damon can play intellectuals, or even spooks, but action heroes? It is to laugh.

While Renner isn't Jason Statham, he's a huge improvement on that other guy. And Rachel Weisz is actually convincing as a scientist, or at least not a bimbo. Edward Norton is always interesting - unfortunately he has no scenes with Renner's character.

The first two acts are quite good, the disappointment starts with the third act, which is comprised about a 30 minute scooter chase where Rachel Weisz belts a bad guy with her motorcycle helmet.  Otherwise it is not interesting, neither in terms of narrative nor the way it's shot, and the implied hand to hand combat scene with a more advanced specimen (yes, insert all the terminator references you want) never happens.

That said, Weisz and Renner have decent chemistry and the camera likes them. Stacey Keach and Norton are fine. I think Scott Glenn has one scene and is pretty much wasted. The machinations of the different warring spook departments are interesting, and pretty realistic given what I've read about the state department in Iraq and Iran.

There IS NO PLOT

Black Brier? Why DID that guy jump out the window? What's the point of all this? Ahh...never mind. I'm going sit back and enjoy the chases and action."" In any case, you needn't worry about the plot, because there isn't one.

You demand to know the excuse for a plot? Okay. The cancelled super-agent programs are resulting in ""clean-up"" where loose ends are tied up and shot through the head. Our two likable protagonists played by the always charming Jeremy Renner and always gorgeous Rachel Weisz are hunted down by the always cool Edward Norton and his intelligence network. There. That's it.

Characters?

It is really nice to see Jeremy Renner get a starring role, even if the studio execs thought it was a throw-away. He was enormously likable in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (giving the impression of super-spy meets Brendan Fraser in one handsome friendly package), and I was ready for him to play hero. Here his character (like Matt Damon's Bourne) says almost nothing about his past, yet we come to feel we know him. He's a very friendly guy. Perhaps too friendly for his profession. He's also very, very skilled. And in snippets we come to understand where he came from, and it lends sympathy to his predicament.

The scientist played by Rachel Weisz could have been a cookie-cutter damsel and instead was played as a real human being thrust into an impossible situation with a super-spy and an army of trained killers after her. NIcely done. Edward Norton has a smaller part in this film, but nonetheless proves about to anchor things with cold intelligence previously portrayed by much older actors.

Entertainment

But let's be honest. The REAL star of this film is the camerawork, music, and cinematography. The roller-coaster ride that ensues once the kill-order goes through. And yes, THAT star is in fine form.

Bourne Identity reinvented the action film, but this film is a more enjoyable movie (to me anyway). There's some actual cinematography instead of shaky-cam. There's some beautiful good-old-fashioned-hollywood-film-making. And the film is better for it. The inevitable chase scene might not blow your mind like the one from Bourne Identity, and you're not going to see any agent vs. agent hand-to-hand insanity, but overall this film is less of a downer, and more of a film you can sit down, watch and just enjoy.

Oh don't get me wrong, there's a brutual execution of scientists who have outlived their usefulness, and plenty of other fights to be seen, there just isn't the same level of stabbed-through-the-hand-with-a-pen and strangled-to-death grittiness that pervades the other Bourne films. If you LIKED those scenes you may find this one tame by comparison. Personally I find it less stressful and more enjoyable. Mileage may vary.

My Fav

As I get older, I find myself enjoying films that are more light-hearted and just plain old fun to watch, as opposed to films that are great, but not very enjoyable. This film is on my shelf next to Men In Black 3, Mission Impossible 4, Tron Legacy, John Carter, and Prince of Persia. Yeah, to me at least, it's THAT kind of movie. Well worth owning.",1395100800,2,3659,4.808917197452229
5154916,5,B008EHZWOU,"That is the way the movies is advertised on the cover and it definitely delivers.  Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is completely and totally as kick-ass as Jason ever was.  (Mom thinks that Aaron looks much more the age Jason would have looked, she thought Matt Damon looked too young ~~~~I guess to each his own).  I love Aaron and I love the thread of Jason throughout the movie and when it gets to the end and they play ""Extreme Ways,"" I jump up and do a ""Bourne dance,""  but that's just me!!!",1394928000,,492,4.315217391304348

The movie was all about staying alive with blue and green pills rather than trying to piece together a conspiracy to hide a governmental program or expose those over it.  Tony Gilroy should have focused on further exposing the program to the public and have internal fighting over that exposure, and even go as far as having some of those fighting it also help ""Renner"" and be killed in the process.",1393200000,,516,4.648351648351649

I think a lot of people were expecting to see Matt Damon and may have thought that Jeremy Renner was replacing him. Well, that's not what I got from the movie. Jeremy Renner was a new character being introduced as another pawn/killer who happens to be part of the Tredstone experimental-conspiracy of mass producing contract killers. The Bourne Legacy lives on because they still haven't caught Jason Bourne because they believe he is dead lying at the bottom of the river. Well, I don't believe he is dead, he will be back.

5154961,4,B008EHZWOU,"I found this film to be a well put together plot, with good character development, an exceptional cast of actors, and an underlying mystery that gradually emerges. The plot involves the basic concept that a man needs some medicine or knowledge or something to keep going, to keep existing.  However, this man is being chased. Along the way he meets folks who give him clues or help him a little until he finds the maiden in distress that happens to have the major clue to his needs. This is one of the most basic narratives in storytelling and in this film it is taken to great heights with exciting visuals. Jeremy Renner, who proved his exceptional acting skills in The Hurt Locker, plays Aaron Cross (#5). He has been genetically altered by the US government to be a fighting, brilliant, quick, long endurance spy.  However he is dependent on chemicals to keep going since the genetic process did not fully integrate with his genome to become permanent. In other words he can deteriorate like the genius who becomes mentally retarded in the film Charlie. Anyway, the science project goes wrong and the US Government decides to pull the plug on all these spies which is a bit more challenging that you think. Stacey Keach and Ed Norton play retired Navy and Air Force Officers who have to dismantle the program and dispose of the genetically altered spies. In these type stories, the hero in his quest to find the magic grail, the medicine that keeps him alive, discovers the maiden in distress, rescues her and then finds she has the secret to getting the grail. Some of the best scenes are when government agents descend on the home of Dr. Marta Shearings three story house in the wild woods and gradually their sweet talk reveals homicidal government fanatics. Rachel Weisz plays the PhD biogeneticist who helps #5 in his quest to find the treatment that will keep him alive. Oscar Isaac plays #3 up in the mountains of Canada ( I guess) and these tense scenes in the snowy mountains with wolves are a visual treat. The grail ends up in Manila and the motorcycle chase scenes in Manila are outstanding. Louis Ozawa Changchien is great as the next generation genetically modified agent who pursues Renner and Weisz through Manila. So we get a great cast who perform well in a plot that is a time proven as any can be. We also get great chase scenes and an unfolding mystery that is finally revealed to our hero and the audience at the same time. It may be formulaic but it still is very entertaining.",1389916800,,2504,4.6247191011235955
5154962,2,B008EHZWOU,"Loved the original Bourne series, but this one failed for me.

Constructed of jerkily-sewn-together fragments and flashbacks, this is the worst-directed and -edited headline movie I've seen in a long time. Nothing cohesive about it; difficult to follow, without enough real action to make that palatable. Near the end there was finally a fast-paced chase scene, but the inept filming (hand-held camera too close to the action, bad angles) made it too frustrating to track.

The end was stupid. (And if you've seen the other Bourne movies, you KNOW it's the end when That Music kicks in.) Enough said.

This movie kept me engaged. The bad guys were our good guys, a group whom we don't dare ask HOW
they do their jobs, only that they eliminate our enemies. In that role, Ed Norton and the actors in his scenes were
superb. Norton deserved an award for his performance, even more so then Renner.

I still can't see anyone kicking with so much force and the bike not being effected but this is just a minor annoyance to me personally. The movie is good, the action is just right once I get over that bike scene. It has just enough suspense and surprises to make this more than a sequel.

5154988,2,B008EHZWOU,"I love the ""Bourne"" series- books and movies. Jeremy Renner is a great actor, however a ""Bourne"" movie just isn't the same (and doesn't meet my expectations) without Matt Damon. I purchased this movie because of the three previous movies in the ""Bourne"" series. I thought this movie was a waste of money and a waste of time. Oddly enough, they incorporated many actual scenes from previous movies in the series (not sure why) into this movie. Gave it two stars because I like action/ adventure movies. Maybe they should re-release it with a different title and alternate ending and then people (like me) will view it for what it is, not for what they hoped it would be.",1388448000,2,669,4.630252100840337
5154989,5,B008EHZWOU,"When Matt Damon stopped playing the Jason Bourne role, I was leary about Jeremy Renner taking over.  But I've fallen in love with him as the Bourne character.  He does an outstanding job.  This movie has a great plot, great acting, and like all of the Bourne movies, it has that ""hang-on-to-your-seat"" pace.  I say ""Buy it"".  I have it as a part of my DVD collection.",1388448000,,367,4.417910447761194
5154990,2,B008EHZWOU,"Although the acting is fine in this movie, the entire thing seems like a pointless exercise.  It seems to rather desperately refer to the previous Bourne movies, and actually depends on viewers' familiarity with them.  Jeremy Renner is an excellent actor but he really does not have much to do in this movie, as it seems a good half of his time on screen is actually a stuntman running, jumping, falling or riding a motorcycle.  And Rachel Weisz is simply reprising her role in ""Chain Reaction"" as a female scientist in jeopardy being led around by her hero.  Some of the story is slightly interesting, like the scenes on how the bureaucrats try to cover up all their misdeeds, but the long, long chase scene is mind-numbing and the movie ends just when you think something of significance is finally going to start happening.  They are obviously setting us up for a sequel, but they should have filmed a complete story of some kind to start with.",1388361600,3,947,4.6467065868263475

I jumped up and down with excitement and intrigue when I saw the first three Bourne movies. This movie didn't have the same effect. You might like it, you might not. Either way if you liked the first three you should give it a chance. Maybe its just me but It seemed hard to follow.",1388275200,,443,4.211764705882353

5154998,3,B008EHZWOU,"The first three installments shared what I think was equal success with Jason Bourne fans because of how his story continued to develop through the series. This was just flat out missing something that the first 3 had. Hats off to Renner for trying to keep things going but this was not nearly as interesting as the typical Bourne installments that preceeded it. It almost seemed to wonder a bit and even though there were some decent action sequences, it was lacking in the fluency of the overall plot. I had to watch it twice so as to comprehend a couple oddities I missed the first time. Was it watchable? Yes. If you are a big fan of the original trilogy, Will you enjoy this as much? Uh, not for me to ruin anyone's Jason Bourne fun but for me this 4th installment fell quite short and was not of the same caliber as the others. Just my two cents worth.",1387929600,,858,4.3354037267080745

I had certainly wanted to see Matt Damon once again as Jason Bourne, but this movie is not about that - it's about the entire system that produced Jason Bourne and others of his kind.  This is a fast paced , action packed thriller!  If you have seen the Bourne movies you are already familiar with much of the background.  This is exactly what the title suggests - The Bourne Legacy.  I enjoyed this movie greatly and can't wait for the inevitable sequel to this movie and an expansion of the entire Bourne universe.",1387584000,,670,4.328

5155006,4,B008EHZWOU,I like this movie. The new star Aaron is fun to watch. The movie is fast paced and keeps you on your toes. But really calling it part of the Bourne Legacy is misleading. It's good enough to be it's own story.,1386979200,,208,3.9761904761904763

I think they've done a pretty good job of it so far. Odd at first not seeing Matt Damon but this character with Jeremy Remner works. Ed Norton plays a pretty good nemesis. As with the previous 3 in the series there's plenty of action, so if you like a good action flick or are addicted to the Bourne series as I am, you'll enjoy this.",1386806400,,496,4.02020202020202

They think they can keep it ""Bourne-like"" if the mention Jason Bourne's name throughout the movie, as well as give us brief glimpses of characters from the first 3 films. It doesn't work. I wandered off in the middle and never went back.....don't buy it, watch it for free on TV, or when it becomes free on your Kindle. It's a bargain bin ripoff of the first 3 films, with NO Jason Bourne.......apparently Matt Damon was making ""We Bought a Zoo"" during the making of this movie.....don't even get me started on THAT....",1386374400,,652,4.581196581196581

Without going into spoilers, I can say that the plot was silly and it bore little to no resemblance to the previous three films, which are some of the best action movies ever made. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it had a good cast, but the script, the premise and the plot were way off.

If you liked the first three, it's a safe bet you won't like the Bourne Legacy. I hope Hollywood will come to its senses and make a new Bourne movie with 100% more Matt Damon that starts by assuming this movie was never made.",1386201600,,600,4.042016806722689

5155016,4,B008EHZWOU,"The best way I can describe this movie would be in an analogy. This movie is like torchwood is to Doctor who. It is based off of the two Damon movies, but it doesn't really bring that much closure to them. Granted, as a stand alone movie, it has it moments (lots of them) of gratuitous action scenes and eye candy. It was still an enjoyable escape.",1385856000,,348,4.208955223880597

5155018,3,B008EHZWOU,"This is the type of film that really makes you question the intelligence of the people in Hollywood, and what they want in a film. Did they even know the film they had? It was an above-average, thinking man's suspenser. So many of the scenes were done really, really well; a tad wordy, perhaps, but none of the frenetic pacing and cutting, the pounding music of the previous efforts.

All for naught. And a savvy theatre-goer knows exactly when the film is going to go off the tracks: when whatever secret agency that is after Renner/Bourne contracts the Asian to kill him. Goodbye. Totally unnecessary, 20 minutes of ridiculousness ensues. They could have -- w five minutes work on the script; saving millions!!  -- just as easily have ended it in the factory, which, w its mass production of pharmaceuticals -- can you say human error? -- was creepy enough.

I've never been a big fan of Weisz's, but this is the best performance of hers I've seen. Another actor I don't particularly care for, Ed Norton, so often it seems goes through the Ed Norton motions, but here he is good. (He was good in Frida, too.)

And did I miss something? Or did the producers? The shoot-up in Weisz's house, following her interrogation by the severe woman and the heavy, a nice scene: but the woman never gets it. I kept on expecting her to jump from a closet. Will she in the sequel?",1385596800,,1367,4.544715447154472
5155019,3,B008EHZWOU,"This latest entry in the Bourne series was very generic somehow.  Contrasted with the very first, it simply pales by comparison.  I found myself somewhat bored by the relentless action, uninvolving plot and poor dialogue.  Perhaps if it were cut by 1/3 or so??",1385337600,,260,4.863636363636363

5155021,5,B008EHZWOU,"A great, smooth follow-on to the previous Bourne sagas. It cuts in footage from the previous movies to tie them in with this one and explain why and how the black operations of our government devastate and attempt to destroy the morals of humanity of the black ops assets that they are creating and the stunning, casual, chilling manner in which people become totally expendable in a split second. The movie follows on the path of destruction that these agencies create once they have made the decision to ""roll-up"" a program and the utter lack of humanity. Given the recent disclosures of the behavior of the NSA and other secretive arms of the government, this and the rest of the Bourne series suddenly become not just fiction, but plausible explanations.

Faithful to the storyline of the series; you'll only be disappointed if you're hung up on Matt Damon. Jeremy Renner is not Matt Damon and Aaron Cross is not Jason Bourne, but this latest installation is an upgrade that retains all the original features while providing fresh enhancements (including Rachel Weisz)... go with the flow, its Bourne 2.0! Very well thought out and scripted; no mindless action here, its edge-of-the-seat all the way through. Final scene is exhilarating as Mobi's tune kicks in.",1384992000,6,682,5.324074074074074

This film shows that the original program is still alive and in fact is not the only program of its kind.  We see two more programs running at the same time.  The Renner character is in a second program that supposedly is faster and stronger than Bourne was.  There is third program which is used to attempt to take out the Renner character that is not only faster and stronger but without any emotion.  To top it off, there are additional programs out there to take over if these programs should also be shut down.  My question is why.

Example- They randomly had Aaron taking these pills which Jason Bourne never took so that kind of threw me off. But, they do explain why Aaron has to be taking the pills. I suppose I was expecting it to be more like the other Bourne movies. After seeing the Avengers were Jeremy Renner was a some what minor role, i was excited to see him in this movie with a major role. I felt like he did a good job acting in this movie and brought a lot of good energy.

It's definitely a movie you need to pay attention in or you'll miss certain, subtle information. Such as- each time I watch it I'll notice or pick up on something I missed the first time watching it.

I did expect to see Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) in the film, so it surprised me when he wasn't; other than seeing only his name carved into a wood beam in a mountain cabin or only to see just a photo of him. I will say Jeremy Renner did a wonderful job as a lead actor in this film. In that way, it was different but good. I'd like to see Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner meet and work together at securing a normal life without the threat of being killed by hired assassins.  I would recommend this film if you enjoy action packed movies that are cleverly done.",1378598400,,615,4.168067226890757

It gave it a sense of the Old West, down to earth type, and yet in our time also.  Renner is excellent and so is Weisz.  I have not tired of it yet, especially when you consider what is being offered otherwise.  The only thing I wish they would stop doing is cursing, using God's name in vain.

And, a puppet master portrayed by Edward Norton.  Hats off to the Gilroy brothers for a tight screen play... And, also to Tony Gilroy's story and directing.  The production quality is great, as is the stunts and action sequences, as it should be in an action movie.  Some will say its the same story, well, so what?  I like the story...they can continue telling it, especially if they get actors such as these to play the characters:  Jeremy Renner, Oscar Issac, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton.  The interaction between Jeremy's Aaron Cross character and Oscar's character is dynamic and very revealing... A good bit of acting. The 'in the car' scene between Jeremy's character and Rachel's character is great as well.  The desperate humanity in the characters is revealed... Jeremy shines again with the hospital sequences which tell you so much about where Aaron Cross began....and, then you have the 'running' scenes which provide the action but also move the story along.  That is the mix that makes for a good movie.  And, it really helps that Jeremy Renner did a lot of his own stunts.

I was a big fan of the Ludlum Bourne books. I was not ready to accept Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, but the movies were so good that I became a big fan again. This movie is a trainwreck. It is a complete departure from the spirit and essence of the Jason Bourne character, who although being a highly trained elite person, was nonetheless intensely human. Like so many movies, it seems the film-by-committee boys and girls stripped the film of all that is worthy, extracted the action scenes, and left the depth, character development, narrative and nuance in the trashbin.

I believe this film probably killed the Bourne franchise, unless they realize how much they screwed it up.",1377907200,2,718,4.736
5155083,5,B008EHZWOU,"Color me skeptical when THE BOURNE LEGACY was released.  I loved this paranoid, action-packed franchise with Matt Damon leading the madness and mayhem.  So I knew this installment had its work cut out for me to enjoy it, and now that I've seen THE BOURNE LEGACY several times, I truly believe it's the best of the bunch.  Jeremy Renner brings even more energy to the lead role, Agent Aaron Cross, and I never knew I would so enjoy a sneering Edward Norton as the CIA cover-up specialist determined to bring Cross down.  And to pay homage--if not much-needed continuity for plot purposes--to its predecessors, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, Albert Finney, and David Strathairn all make brief appearances in character.

Aaron Cross is not your typical Jason Bourne--he's Jason Bourne super charged.  The assassin has been genetically enhanced by his government handlers; his strength, agility, and intelligence are superhuman.  Only now, the CIA wants to cover up its tracks, destroy the evidence of Operation Outcome; to do this, every operative in the field must die.  So we have what we've enjoyed in all the Bourne predecessors--a 24/7 high tech chase, with Cross narrowly missing death at every turn.  Plus, he's accompanied by a government doctor who is herself on the Kill List (Rachel Weisz), forcing the two of them to flee to Manila in hopes of getting Cross to ""viral out.""  The climax is a heart-pounding motorcycle chase along the streets, alleys, and sidewalks of Manila--a chase that dares you not to be hanging on to your chair.  And finally, the ending to THE BOURNE LEGACY is what I enjoyed most of all.  It's open-ended, meaning another installment is on its white knuckle way.

Performances are good but I did sense the absence of Matt Damon.  This is not the same as the James Bond movies where I find the different Bonds all bonded(sorry! I HAD to do that) into a continuity of persona.  It may be that the Bond movies do not attempt a real plot line linkage from movie to movie but rather carry the mystique as the unifying basis.  Having said that, I do not come away with a negative but rather feel both the money and the time were well rewarded.  Face it - the Damon series set a very high bar",1377388800,,655,4.118110236220472

Ed Norton's character was boring and unconvincing as well.  It looked like these people just showed up and read their lines and didn't put much into it.  Perhaps it was the directing?  Even the script was poor.

The end.  About one hour into the movie, it gets interesting for about 7 minutes, then there's a who lot more talk.  No wonder Matt Damon turned it down.  Screenplay is inept and direction is mediocre.  I'm still not sure what this was about or what was at stake -- if anything.  The dialogue is a laughable attempt to use tech and military jargon.  The take-away is: Be sure and take your ""chems"" when off the grid.

5155135,4,B008EHZWOU,"I think this movie may not actually appeal to people who really enjoyed the prior films. I happened not to like those primarily because Jason Bourne was a bit more of a macho character. If you come to this movie expecting that... you may be disappointed.  This movie takes off with a bit of an older / wiser / more human lead character caught up in the CIA game. Aaron Cross. Aaron was in the army and presumably killed, but really went to CIA and became an agent. The movie starts a bit slow but I think it was necessary to telling a new story. The twist here is that Aaron was not exactly bright prior to joining the CIA. He is a hero that has been largely created via medical science -- given medication that made him smarter and more physically capable. There is a humanity to Aaron Cross that was missing with Jason Bourne. Aaron kills people for sure but you get the feeling he would have better judgment than Bourne. I believe it is also suggested that Aaron's fellow agents in a program called ""Outcome"" are trained to be more human than the typical CIA killer.

The movie starts as the CIA is in complete crisis mode as the events surrounding the first three Bourne movies convince the CIA that they have to kill all the current tredstone or treadstone like agents to cover their tracks. They kill a lot of them but Aaron manages to survive and realizes what is happening. Aaron has one large problem though he is out of medications. He goes after the doctor who has been treating him in the program... Dr. Marta Shearing who is currently being targeted as well. They both go on the run and try to get the treatment that will allow Aaron not to be dependent on the medications.

Clearly Marta is the love interest but the good news is that any romance was largely pushed off to future movies. They largely suggest that Aaron has a bit of a crush on Marta and she may have liked him too. But in this movie they are just friends that need each other.  They have bigger concerns the entire movie. I found the chase scenes interesting and intense and I think the soundtrack helps a lot with that.

For me it was quite the surprise and I was glad I watched it. I didn't go in hoping to see something like the prior films and I was happily surprised.",1374969600,,2253,4.342042755344418
5155136,3,B008EHZWOU,"He's not Matt Damon but he does a pretty good job in his place.  I guess for me, Matt Damon is Bourne.  Good action but it just didn't seem like a Bourne movie.",1374883200,,160,3.8181818181818183
5155137,3,B008EHZWOU,"I didn't have very high hopes for this film, but I was curious what they would do to go beyond the absolute perfection of the Bourne trilogy.  The Damon film, which we must contrast to this offshoot, balanced many factors:  Bourne was vulnerable but an expert killer (i.e. realistic), the shadowy CIA/NSA group was believable and timely, and the principal character's plight and search were compelling.  Unfortunately, the Bourne Legacy doesn't quite succeed at any of these.  I will attempt to go into the reasons for this without revealing plot spoilers.

First, pumped up by some kind of magical meds, the new character is more like a superhero.  His abilities and even his intelligence are enhanced by biotech.  In other words, we are almost if not quite in Spiderman territory.  So the good guys are better, the baddies badder.  Second, in its attempt to deepen the conspiracy, we learn that there is another group, never defined and perhaps more deeply entrenched, that is masterminding the new efforts.  It includes scientists, military types, and some kind of ominous organization that even Ezra kowtows to.  While the film is skillfully interwoven with events that were seen in the trilogy, advancing the story of Landy and her enemies, the new group feels grafted on.  Third, the principal characters - played by Renner and Weisz - lack the tightness of focus that Bourne had in his need to overcome his amnesia and discover the mystery behind his conditioning.  Taken together, I simply couldn't quite suspend my disbelief.

Finally, there are many holes in the film's plot - the viewer doesn't know how characters figure out certain things, e.g. when Aaron springs up in Dr. Shearing's house to save her in the knick of time.  How did the new conspirators find the couple in the Philippines?  WHere do they get their money?  Why would Shearing throw herself in with Aaron?  Presumably, some of this may be explained in subsequent films, but the effect is to lessen the film's believability further.

That leaves the viewer with the tried-and-true situation room, where a team tracks our heros as they elude everything they throw at them, and then there are chases and good fights.  And the minute you see Weisz, you know she is going to be a love interest of some sort.  Of course, Aaron will almost certainly ""bring the fight to your doorstep"" in sequels.  It has the feel of a formula film, another mega-franchise.

Oddly, it works best if you separate this offshoot from the original trilogy in your mind.  Viewed that way, it is pretty fun action/scifi.  THe actors are all good, if rather 2-dimensional.  Recommended.",1374796800,,2634,4.902714932126697

Jeremy Renner is not Jason Bourne, that role is left for Matt Damon. Jeremy plays a role for a character caught in a parallel conspiracy where at some point it ties in with Bourne.

5155168,4,B008EHZWOU,"""...But could you ever say it loud enough, and fast enough, that they'd be too afraid to finish what they started."" - Aaron Cross

I loved this movie on so many different levels; the actors, the sets, the action and the urgency of the story. The screenplay was excellent and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz bring so much to the characters of Aaron Cross and Marta Shearing.  What could have been a straightforward, no-emotion plot turns out to be a nail-biting thriller.  The cinematography is great for bringing out the details and adding depth to this incredible movie. The beginning was startlingly quick and real.  The rooftop/street chase was absolutely amazing; the best chase sequence I've seen yet on screen.  The ending was perfect.  I consider this one of my favorite films.
The only serious con to the film: The plot was slow to start.  The heart-pounding action did not really kick in--and the two protagonists didn't even meet--until about 40 minutes into the film.  (I believe a movie should be well-grounded and moving within the first 20 minutes.)  But it is a difficult thing to tie The Bourne Legacy to the previous trilogy, and it was done really well, so I'm not overly bothered.  The scenes are quick and sharp, so at least the beginning isn't bogged down.  If you are looking for an action movie that is more than a simple plot with a lot of fistfights, then this is a fantastic pick.",1373241600,3,1405,4.6938775510204085

5155172,3,B008EHZWOU,I was dissappointed.  Renner and Weiscz not withstanding this movie is mostly a rehash of all the action in the earlier Bourne movies.  If you've seen the first three you've seen this one.  True the plot is different - instead of Bourne going after a larger CIA entity  the CIA is trying to kill off all its operatives and scientific personel but misses Renner who saves Weiscz.  There's the standard motorcycle and car chase plus the flight for safety across the foof tops. The movie even ends like all the other movies with the possiblity of another episode coming since Renner and Weiscz didn't solve this films crisis.  If you are a Bourne fan you may enjoy this film but it isn't (in my opinion) as good or as well put together as the first three.,1373155200,,752,4.492647058823529

The movie is dull and boring where there's not much of a twist. It just can't tense up my nerve cells. So much chasing on the roof and bike. The assassin sent from Thailand to Manila really tried his best to look cool and cold-blooded but I really don't see the essence there. The worst part is that after a few round ( >15mins) chasing, with one simple side kick the assassin bang into a pillar and died, what a joke without even any physical contact/fighting.

I guess a good movie from the start will find it's very challenging to have a breakthrough episodes and it's better to stop at 3 episodes the most (Iron1~2~3, Spiderman1~2~3)",1373068800,2,753,4.489051094890511

BUT, the format is this squinched up strip across the TV screen with a black strip above and a black strip below; not exactly the full screen that one would expect. Also after the promos are played the format does not go directly into the movie. One has to play the promos about five or six times before the DVD plays the movie. So one gets to see the movie...is it worth the hassle? You decide.
This problem is the same with every DVD that I have purchased thru Amazon. Perhaps it's my DVD player? That's possible, but all of the movies that I have purchased at a store don't do this.",1372896000,,789,4.197368421052632

5155206,2,B008EHZWOU,"There's no reason this movie should have been included in the Bourne saga. It seemed like a cheap ploy to sell more movie tickets.

I knew going in it wasn't based on the Jason Bourne character, which is a shame. I've read almost all of the Bourne books, including the Bourne Legacy. The movie was NOTHING like the book at all! Therefore, in my mind they should not have used the title. In the book, it is titled legacy because it features Jason's son from his first marriage. This movie features a random character in one of the super secret government training programs.

Reasons I didn't like this movie:
Chems-  all of the assets are on pill form drugs that improve their strength and mental faculties. It made it extremely easy and convenient to wipe out the entire program by simply switching their pills to some variant of cyanide.
Fighting- Not much to speak of. There are always several more fights in the books than the movies. This was no different, but features almost no fighting at all. From my count: fight with wolf (if you can even count that), fight with agents to save Rachel Weisz (probably one of the best fight sequences in the movie), fight in the factory (lasted about 10 seconds), and fight in the alleyway (again, 5 seconds). Quite the disappointment.
Weaving into Bourne storyline- there were a few nods to events from the third film. They seemed very half hearted and could easily be missed, especially with amount of time that passed (in real life) between 3 and legacy. Mostly, they came off as an afterthought like ""if we have Bourne in the title, we should include this event in the storyline"". Pathetic, really.

The best scene of the movie was arguably the chase sequence at the end. But there was a point where it seemed WAY too unbelievable. Almost like the Peter Griffin fighting the chicken scene. The opposing assassin survives a major car wreck, steals a motorcycle, pounces  from one motorcycle to another, somehow manages to catch up to Cross and his companion, and then takes 1 or 2 shots and flips into a fruit stand. At that point wouldn't you simply call it a day, realize you've been beaten? Apparently not. He brushes himself off, mounts the bike, and catches up again! Seriously, I need that bike! The guy was determined to finish his contract, by any means necessary it seemed. Not surprisingly he failed, while cross and his biker buddy settle for a nasty bit of road rash.",1371859200,3,2424,4.654205607476635
5155207,4,B008EHZWOU,I do enjoy this story line.  I liked the fast pace action scenes and hoped this had the same kind.

Now, Cross needs the pills several times day . . . will he be raiding the Philippines plant every 6 months or so . . .  can he handle Outcome II ""assets"" taking green pills in hand-to-hand combat when they're sent to ""close down"" the operation, now that the CIA knows Cross can hear drones launching TV guided missiles . . . stay tune for Bourne Legacy Penultimate - the Cross Strikes Back.",1371427200,,1148,4.72
5155214,3,B008EHZWOU,"Bourne Legacy is a pretty good spy thriller. Renner is great and Ed Norton and most of the supporting cast is solid. Pacing and production values including photography are up to Hollywood standard. The director did an awful job with Rachel, who is a fine actress. He directed her like she's some halfwit sniveling emotional infant whining and whinging in every scene.
This is hardly credible since her character is supposed to be a PHD in Chemistry and Science with a heavy security clearance working on top secret defense projects.
She's directed to behave like double digit IQ employee at Wal Mart. Aside from that, the film is watchable.",1371427200,,640,4.8807339449541285
5155215,4,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Legacy essentially is a continuation of the Bourne Ultimatum, in fact much of the film runs in tandem with the Bourne Ultimatum in that there are references to Bourne being in Manhattan, Pamela Landy's work to implicate
Noah Vosen, Ezra Kramer, and Dr. Albert Hirsch in their involvement with Treadstone, Blackbriar, and other operations.  What threw me for a loop was that everything that was established in the Bourne Ultimatum, that is all of the evidence that Bourne (or David Webb, take your pick) and Landy assembled to take down those involved with the program appears to be negated in The Bourne Legacy.  Well, maybe not negated, but we see Noah Vosen slithering through a plethora of words to essentially say ""what difference does it make!"" in reference to Treadstone, Blackbriar, etc.  The last we see of Pam Landy is her getting into a car, followed by the press, and telling them that if they want any other comments to speak with her lawyer but that she did not have any regrets about the choices/statements she had made.  So, maybe this is the storyteller's way of saying that those behind Treadstone, Blackbriar, etc. will be held accountable.

That said, the Bourne Legacy centers around Aaron Cross, who is a member of another program called ""Outcome"" - essentially Treadstone but this program also uses physical and mental enhancing medications to regiment its operatives.  The events of the Bourne Ultimatum send those running Outcome to scurrying around like rats, feverishly working to scrap all evidence of the program to cover their rear-ends. Of course, their fail to eliminate Aaron Cross and one of the research scientists developing the medications, Dr. Marta Shearing - thus we have our new ""Jason and Marie"".  They discover that Aaron has been weened off of the physical medication but the mental medications requires one last treatment, which takes them to Manilia (the capital of the Philippines) in order to obtain the medication.  Once done, it is a mad dash to go dark and avoid those behind Outcome.

An intriguing idea, all in all, but the film feels like it is in need of a sequel (or at least an epilogue would have been helpful) to wrap up loose ends, maybe they are leaving that up to the audience.",1371427200,6,2249,4.851174934725848

Renner doesn't have a compelling screen presence in this type of film, which will come as no surprise to those who saw him in the Avengers or MI: Ghost Protocol.

Renner's character wasn't much to work with, either.  At one point, he confesses to innate stupidity if he doesn't take his super soldier pills.  With Bourne, one always had the sense he was an exceptional individual to begin with, pushed to his potential by extraordinary (and twisted) training.  The audience is cheering for a natural champion fighting off his oppressors.  In the Bourne Legacy, we are supposed to cheer for a dim-witted government employee rebelling against the people that saved him from mediocrity.

I think the timeline overlaps the first two? However, I think this one gives us information about the hearings that wasn't in the previous movies. Understanding all of that wasn't entirely necessary to enjoyment of this film, but I like to have my details straight. The main character was believable. His desire to remain smart was touching and gave him good motivation. If anything, I'll probably watch the first Bourne movies and then watch this one again.",1370131200,,780,4.8283582089552235

 In Renner and Weisz the film offers two protagonists who do a good job of conveying evolving understanding as their worlds are thrown into disarray and then, working together, the strength to try and survive. Norton is excellent as the adversary in what seems to be an unusual role for him.
 The many references to earlier 'Bourne' mean that it helps if you have seen 'Ultimatum' but in any event expect a top quality espionage thriller.",1369612800,2,594,4.871287128712871

The female lead - Rachel Weisz - is also portrayed as a strong character and has some very courageous portrayals in quite a few scenes.

Even with all the action, there are deeper issues raised and the character played by Ed Norton and others highlight some interesting and provocative items.

I liked it and I'd recommend it to others looking for action with great actors.",1369526400,2,682,4.714285714285714
5155255,3,B008EHZWOU,"I found it amusing that so many of the characters involved in this movie kept asking what's happening, why is this happening, what's going on?  I gave up wondering ""why"" after the first installment in this conspiracy series.  There is no purpose other than to keep repeating the same story, filled with the same types of characters doing exactly the same things for the same reasons.  It's amazing how many times they fill the same control room with the same people hunting down the same guy, having the same fearless leader order their death and no one bats an eye.  Considering their proclivity for murdering their own people, what's their job security like?  And what idiot would work for someone who's willing to kill their own!?  This goes way beyond throwing someone under the bus.

At this point, I have to say enough is enough.  This film is basically just one long, extended, endless, chase sequence.  Worse.  They present this version (of the same story!) in miniscule snippets that leave it feeling like a trailer teaser.  This miserable story jumps all over the place (and time) and is doled out with such secrecy that when it abruptly ended I was left with the sense that nothing was really accomplished.  This movie is filled with nothing but continuous subterfuge.  Liars lying to liars about secret programs and ""sin eaters,"" chromosome alterations, paid assassins belonging to heretofore unheard of secret programs, all with nifty names and decoder rings!  It's maddening.  It didn't help that the new bad guy (Edward Norton) was remarkably ineffectual as a mastermind.  The actor has no presence, especially when going toe to toe with someone like Stacy Keach.  The wolf was more menacing, and look what happened to it!

The best thing about this movie is the story. It has some deep character developments. The shooting scene in the lab is a good example. It's shocking and touching at the same time because I know why it happened.

It has quite a few suspenseful moments. The shooting in the lab is one of them.
The acting of many actors is engaging. One of the supporting actress who played a female killer is convincingly scary. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are believable. I did care for their characters.

There are a lot of gripping action scenes. For example, the scene where Rachel was sandwiched between 2 policemen in a narrow alley.

Most crucial is the startling new role of an outstanding young woman super-scientist, the main Super-Soldier designer for the dire C.I.A. enterprise, vibrantly executed by Rachel Weisz. These fascinating new factors are working toward a futuristic conflict on a cosmic scale for the nature of life itself.

Without Matt Damon I thought it was just trying to scrape-up any last $ that might be available.  After months of the movie being out and ignoring it - and bored with anything else I could find - I gave the movie a try on XBox Movies - rented it in SD.

I was shocked with the movie.  It was a great story, very interesting and believable and the acting was great.  At first I couldn't believe it might be better than the previous 3 - even though that's how I felt.  After reflection and watching it two more times - I truly like it the best - hands down.  There is not any wasted time or scenes in the movie - its never slow.  Jerremy Renner and Rachel Weiss (sp?)are outstanding.  The rest of the cast was outstanding too.  There's an edge to Renner - and a 'not so perfect' attitude that made it very appealing to me.  Weiss complemented Renner perfectly - she was not too weak or too strong.

Once I got the idea that this was a concurrently running program with the Treadstone situation, I was able to focus on the characters and situations without expecting this to be like the three previous movies. The scripting is great, and there are a host of fine actors who thoroughly do their part. The camera work and musical scoring are notable. Good stuff.

Jeremy is intense, human, believable, and obviously an athlete. Rachel does an outstanding job of combining shocked overwhelm with critical survival instincts. It is refreshing not to see ""flouncing"" when she runs. Ed Norton always delivers... the list goes on and on.

Are they serious what did they expect when they rented it. Action non-stop,special affects realistic and exciting,acting very well done,plot interesting and much better than the last one in the series. This movie was close to 2 hours long and it goes by so fast it seems like its 45 min. long. That was my experience I think the one and two star people would be the same ones who give Les Miserable 5 stars.",1366329600,,531,4.267326732673268

5155327,4,B008EHZWOU,"Good action movie. Bourne story just a teaser. Disappointing that Bourne series characters were even represented as they lead to unrealized expectations or anticipation. Like ""Iron Man Legacy"" with no Iron Man - maybe a photo, or Pepper Potts seen in a news clip. This story has the legs to stand on it's own.",1366156800,,309,4.7407407407407405
5155328,5,B008EHZWOU,Jeremy Renner is great for this role and he did this movie justice. There is plenty of action to keep you interested throughout the entire movie and the plot was well portrayed. All the characters in this movie were well suited for their roles. I can hardly wait for more. If we're not having Matt Damon then Jeremy is the man to take over.,1366156800,,340,4.328125

5155332,4,B008EHZWOU,Promising continuation of the Bourne story. If you liked the original series you should like this one. The ending leaves opening for more...,1366070400,,140,5.130434782608695
5155333,4,B008EHZWOU,This is a really good movie that caught me by surprise.  I wasn't sure which direction the series was going to take after the last movie.  Jeremy Renner pulls off a pretty good programmed killer.  Lots of action.  The plot was a bit twisted in the first third but I figured it out.,1366070400,,281,4.245283018867925
5155334,5,B008EHZWOU,"At the surface of the story of BL is pretty simple and straight forward. Basically, an Outcome agent is in need of his meds. However,for the viewers with a little higher IQ the story is much deeper than that. As the secret operations and mastermind behind those assassin programs reveal itself, NRAG, who is headed by Eric Byer played by Edward Norton. Edward does a fantastic job playing the mastermind of all those programs. His explanation of the ""SIN EATER"" was the main moral of the story.

Overall, the movie is excellent and ranks up there with the best of the other Bourne flicks perhaps even better. The movie starts a little slow trying to aim the viewer on the justification of killing their latest assassin program Outcome. Then at exactly 30 minutes into the movie the action starts and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie. Blueray makes a difference.

Jeremy Renner and Rachel Wieisz were superb in their acting. They played their parts very well. Renner was an excellent agent whose part had to stand up to the footsteps of Damon and did so successfully. Rachel as the mad scientist was very believable. I hope to see all the actors and actresses of BL along with Damon to be in the next sequel. BL is a very entertaining movie. I highly RECOMMEND IT.",1365897600,,1291,4.560344827586207

5155345,2,B008EHZWOU,Stick with the original Bourne movies. This one was crap. There was no chemistry between the two lead actors. The plot was garbage. This guy is no Bourne. Bourne isn't even in this movie. I literally was bored trying to get through this.,1365465600,2,237,4.534883720930233
5155346,2,B008EHZWOU,This movie flat out aggravated me. I like thrillers that are tough to understand but this movie had so many confusing plots to follow that I tuned out about 3/4 of the way through.

5155365,5,B008EHZWOU,"This is how action flics should be made. Renner continues to impress me since I first took note of him in Hurt Locker. He commands the screen whenever he's on it. He's even better in my opinion than Damon, and I thought Damon was very good indeed as Bourne. The story follows the Bourne formula, with the hero being pursued by his rogue government agency employers, the girl-interest well played by Rachel Weisz, the obligatory car (or motorcycle, in this case) chase down the streets of some third world city (Manila, this time). But it's all done so well it's a hoot to watch. On reviewing I especially liked the relationship between Aaron Cross (Renner) and the other ""program participant"" he links up with at the remote cabin in Alaska - good dialog and appealing characters.",1364947200,,779,4.735294117647059

The actor who played the lead character did a good job, and there a couple of exciting scenes, But it just was not the same, furthermore I personally did not like the ending.  I feel that if they are going to do any more films in the Bourne tradition, they should star Matt Damon.

They should have just given the movie some other name.  As an action type movie, it wasn't bad, but tacking the Bourne name to it to try to make more money on it was sad.  We were very disappointed in it and if there were ever another ""Bourne"" movie made, we probably wouldn't even bother to see it because this one killed the ""Bourne"" name for good.",1364860800,2,505,4.21875

As for the movie , Jeremy is a very good actor and he lived up to his name in the movie, but there was expert tracking and there was no presence of the real Jason Bourne , they both could easily fit in the movie.

The result according to some critics has been mixed but to me, this one new addition is every bit as exciting and involving as the previous films plus it has a good action hero in Jeremy Renner who in a sense reminds me of a modern day James Cagney (they're both Irish). With excellent support from Rachel Weisz and a great supporting cast which includes Stacy Keach, Edward Norton, Albert Finney and a returning Joan Allen from ""Ultimatum""--this is a worthy successor in the Bourne legacy.",1364515200,,771,4.938461538461539

The story itself is action packed and the chemistry between Renner and Rachel Weisz added an element I think the other Bourne movies lacked.

The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-rays have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too!

5155407,4,B008EHZWOU,I don't think this movie was as good as the Bourne trilogy at all but it was an entertaining show that kept my interest throughout. The ties to the original 3 movies was poorly done and not really needed for this movie. I will be interested if a sequel is made how it will play out.,1364083200,,282,4.053571428571429

5155409,5,B008EHZWOU,It is not as good as the first Bourne movie but is at least as good as the second and third Matt Damon version. Jeremy Renner is twice the actor that the self promoting Matt Damon is so that is another plus. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!!,1363996800,,241,4.148936170212766
5155410,5,B008EHZWOU,This was a great addition to this series. After seeing this I can't wait to see where they will go next. Growing up and still to this day the Bond movies are my favorite. The Bourne movies are a close second. But this is like comparing red apples to green apples.,1363910400,,263,4.176470588235294
5155411,5,B008EHZWOU,Oddly believable. Patriotism is indeed the last refuge of scoundrels. Perhaps not a good as former offerings of the series. But I would have rated them 6 stars!,1363910400,,160,4.75

5155418,2,B008EHZWOU,Nowhere near as good as the first three. If they are going to use (The Bourne) as part of the name of the movie they need to do better than that.,1363737600,,145,3.7096774193548385

5155429,3,B008EHZWOU,"After being a fan of all the other Bourne movies I was left greatly disappointed. Bourne Legacy lacks the fighting and critical thinking skills of the previous movies. For most of the movie I was bored and waiting for the action to start. By the time the movie picked up it was basically over. Towards the end of the movie when he was in action his skills were greatly crafted.

They are using experimental drugs on the patients and they become dependent upon those drugs. When they do not have those drugs in their system the affects can be life threatening. Things turn around when the hunter becomes the hunted.

I was expecting more action as we have seen previously but they really missed the mark on this one.",1363478400,,715,4.534883720930233

He pulled off the martial art scenes and conveyed the anxiousness, that would have naturally been present, as one would imagine it would actually be.  I thought Rachel Weisz complimented Renner wonderfully even though her portrayal of Dr. Marta nearly overshadowed Jeremy because she played the part so well.  I thought the movied equalled the others in the Bourne saga.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action/adventure movies.",1362787200,,598,5.1875

Rachel Weisz was excellent too. I thought she played her character with considerable nouse - plus she's very easy on the eyes. An innovative continuation from the original Bourne movies, filmed with the same slick acton sequences that are both gripping and believable. Awesome storyline and the inclusion of Edward Norton was a master stroke.

Bottom line: a top shelf movie that doesn't lose its edge even after watching it twenty times (like I have).",1362700800,,614,4.903846153846154

However, I was ultimately disappointed in the movie, as a whole, because it did not feel like a worthy continuation to carry the Bourne title. Damon set the bar extremely high, and I think it would've been better for this movie to begin a different story under a different title.

5155477,4,B008EHZWOU,"This is a very good film that I enjoyed watching. Renner plays a great and gritty super-agent and he fits the role perfectly to me. The blu-ray quality is very good. I wish it wasn't shown in letterbox, but that's a small gripe. It also doesn't have that many special features. Me personally...I was hoping for a more indepth Bourne review, so those who aren't familiar with the first three movies could get a recap. As it is, if you haven't seen the first three films I think you will be completely lost. It also makes it a bit complicated because Bourne Legacy is taking place at the same time as Bourne Ultimatum, which is the film previous to this Bourne installment. I have seen the first three films and I had to rewatch them because it was very complicated to follow the story in Bourne Legacy. You get the general gist that Renner is trying to get his super soldier drugs, but there is a lot going on that is more subtext and winks to the previous films. If you haven't seen them or you don't remember them then it's probably a good idea to catch up on them. Overall, this was a good movie and I would ignore the haters who want to find fault with it. The super-soldier part is very believable in the context of the film and it adds some intensity to Renner's chracter. Rachel Weisz is also very good and I don't mind that she just stands around waiting for Renner to save her. She's not the action star here and I liked the chemistry between them. I hope there is a sequel with these two in it. I'd definitely watch.",1362441600,,1525,4.317073170731708

5155493,3,B008EHZWOU,"not bad, not great.  The filmmaking team obviously put alot of work into it, and I appreciated that.  Liked the actors playing the leads, all the acting was good.  Thought the writers structured the story well enough, had enough action/fight sequences, and were strong in writing an engaging male character, not so good with the female lead - I thought she should have been quicker on the uptake, considering she was a highly educated doctor and scientist and knew she was testing spies, and working for the government.  I thought the lead male character yelling at her after he found out he'd been administered drugs that made continuing to take some of the pills unnecessary, rich, considering he did similar type of work, basically being told what to do by the government just as the doctor was, and doing it, but not liking it when it was done to him.  I thought the Rachael Weisz character ran unusually, as if she was an olympic sprinter, rather than a doctor.  Hard to get emotionally into these films, as the leads (the spy characters) are trained killers and kill their way through the movies.  I thought the portrayal of the fictitious government agency willing to turn on a dime against it's citizens was chilling (as they did with the doctors/scientists/spies working for them).  I would watch a sequel with these actors, and I'll probably eventually buy the movie (checked it out from the library this time), so I liked it well enough, though I tend not to like quick editing so much, and alot of camera movement, and these are used several places in this movie.  Sometimes the images move so fast and are edited so fast I can't keep up.  I also am not a big fan of the music used, especially when basic, ordinary work is being done in an office setting, and action music is played along side - I find hyper music played against ordinary images distracting, but that is done in Bourne movies.  I wouldn't go to a theater to see these films; I never have.  But as I said I'll probably buy this one eventually, as I bought at least one of the earlier films.  I like Matt Damon but I thought the actor playing Aaron was good too, he's basically written very similarly to Jason Bourne, kind of a spy with a heart of gold (to the woman in his life).  And I've enjoyed Rachael Weisz's work for years.",1362268800,,2307,4.541062801932367

Jeremy Renner is excellent and his hand to hand combat skills make Matt Damon look like a boy scout. I had no idea that these guys were genetically enhanced and not just trained to be elite assassins. I would love to see Damon and Renner together in the next Bourne movie trying to shut down the operation that wants to shut

In the end you will be glad you didn't waste your time on this time suck, without  any entertainment value. I have seen 1960 Kung Fu movies that made more connections. Was this a spy thriller or bad Sci Fi - was there even a script or did they just film a bunch of chase and fight scenes all of which go on way too long to the point you hope that all of Washington DC gets nuked by aliens so it kills everyone because you don't even care - how did this tie into the Bourne Legacy?

So after 3x trying to get the thing to play, as well as attempts @ ""download/import"" from the Amazon ""home site"", to that new Amazon Unbox-thingy, it's been a complete and utter ""wash out""...

Of course I realize that ""this"" is hardly the ""fate of Nations"" - but until we completely devolve into a socialist socio-economic system - I, like many of us, would still like to get what our harder-to-come by money's paid for!

5155509,3,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Legacy is the fourth installment of the Bourne film franchise. It introduces a new protagonist named Aaron Cross played by Renner. This film sort of runs in parallel with the ending of the third installment where Dammon's character , Jason Bourne, exposes the ""Treadstone"" and ""Blackbriar "" government operations to the media.

The newest operation is called ""Outcome"" and this is where Renner picks up as Aaron Cross. The new agent is genetically modified via science through a system of pills that makes him sort of superhuman. The problem is, he is running out of these meds and needs to find more. He basically starts to crash at about the same time the ""Outcome"" project has been terminated. This is where he meets up with Dr. Shearing (Weise) who is one of the doctors that worked on the genetic medicine which gives Renner his strength, speed, and high level of cognition. They stay on the run together trying not to be assassinated like everyone else connected to the new operation. The director over the new government operations is played by Edward Norton. His performance in this movie is barely memorable and lacks that of the previous director of operations played by David Strathairn.

Overall if you have seen the previous three movies, you will be more than likely disappointed in this fourth installment. It is very hard to follow and seems as if it has nothing to do with the original Bourne series which we have watched over and over.

The actors in this film are great actors, but I think the director is what made this movie a miss for us. In my opinion it seems as if this movie was made to take advantage of the previous Bourne movies. It also was way too long and you are almost glad that ends.",1362096000,2,1729,4.643790849673203

5155536,3,B008EHZWOU,"Should not have been released.  After Matt Damon, the movie franchise ended.  We all knew it wasn't gonna continue once he left.  I'm a Renner fan, but this was a horrible sequel.",1361836800,,179,4.53125

5155538,2,B008EHZWOU,Great potential but poor execution.  The plot seems to stall then dissipates. Good action however this film leaves you hanging. This might make a series if developed further.,1361836800,,174,5.214285714285714

5155540,3,B008EHZWOU,"I'm a fan of the Bourne series and this one just doesn't measure up. The first half is exciting and fun and interesting, especially while in Alaska--the wolf thing was pretty creative. I was just about buying this guy as a 'Bourne' type and then they hop a plane and end up in Manila, and then it just gets stupid. Lots of holes in the plot. Chasing pills/drugs and 'virusing out' is just hard for me to believe the way it was presented. The villian in Manilla with his sunglasses and white pants was just ridiculous and i didn't buy it. And it didn't all come together at the end, the ending was weak. Didn't leave a cliffhanger for another one like past movies in this series. Not that I would see a follow up to this one.",1361836800,,724,4.253623188405797

5155543,5,B008EHZWOU,The Bourne Legacy (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) (2012) is a good buy.  My husband loves the entire series of movies.,1361750400,,152,4.62962962962963
5155544,5,B008EHZWOU,this movie is action packed from the beginning to the end.  So far It is my favorite jason bourne movie.,1361750400,,104,4.2
5155545,4,B008EHZWOU,I have always been a Jeremy Renner fan and he makes a great Bourne!  I'm glad to see he was the one to take over Bourne as he has become a great action hero with several great movies under his belt like American Justice League and Ghost Protocol.  A real treat is watching his show The Unusuals to see how versatile an actor he can be.,1361750400,,335,4.0606060606060606

5155547,5,B008EHZWOU,"I loved the movie! Tech meets Bourne, amazing.  Better than the previous Bournes.  I'd compare it to the movie 'The Shooter' but with more action.",1361664000,,146,4.8
5155548,5,B008EHZWOU,"I saw the previous three Bourne movies, and while I felt that they were okay, they ultimately did not make an impression on me, and I would have trouble recalling anything but the most basic of details. Therefore, I did not seek out ""The Bourne Legacy"", nor did I have any desire to watch it. However, a friend had it, and he encouraged me to watch it. I looked at the disc to see how long the run time was, and I groaned when I saw that it clocked in at two hours and fifteen minutes. Fortunately, I gave it a chance- and I'm glad that I did.

From the very beginning, I was drawn into this story by the beautiful cinematography, the engaging way in which the plot was presented, and the subtle, superb acting. Though far from over-the-top, the action sequences are riveting, pulse-pounding, and convincing. All of Cross' moves carry a weight of absolute authenticity (probably due to an outstanding choreographer, more than anything else), which let me sink into the movie and become absorbed. Nothing in the realm of the action is outlandish, and so the movie seems ""real"".

Though juiced up with some high technology and political conspiracy, this is essentially a simple revenge movie at its core. And that's part of what makes it great. In the previous three movies, Jason Bourne kept alluding to a desire for revenge against the agency, but he never seemed to mete out appropriate levels of justice. Cross makes up for that by exacting more revenge in one movie than Jason did in three. Fortunately, there are a few high level targets still standing, which makes me suspect Cross might come back to finish the job.

""The Bourne Legacy"" is a modern action movie, done right.",1361664000,,1680,4.630872483221476
5155549,5,B008EHZWOU,Missed Matt Damon.  The Bourne Supremacy can not be out done.  With that said it was still a good movie.,1361664000,,104,4.15
5155550,4,B008EHZWOU,"classic protagonist challenges in a modern setting, suspenseful with personified layers of textural possibilities. the scope and detailed exposition of bourne's character and the story's historical implications nourished the onlookers hunger for benevolent conclusion of his heroic task.  legacy seemed well directed and edited, with scenes pared down to their crystalline essence.  but my personal preference would have guided me away from that female lead or at least a more diligent reckoning of her acting choices and thus lowered my rating by one star.",1361664000,,557,5.619047619047619

5155555,4,B008EHZWOU,Believe it or not but I liked this movie better then all the others that starred Matt Damon. This dude does a killer job but he is not trying to replace Matt Damon in this movie he is just another fighter.,1361577600,,205,4.024390243902439
5155556,3,B008EHZWOU,"The movie does a nice job incorporating parts of the last Bourne movies to bring the movie watcher into what this movie is about.

5155557,5,B008EHZWOU,This movie is so good and I wasn't sure it would be because Matt Damon isn't in it.  I wasn't sure the series could be the same without him but it was great.,1361577600,,157,3.757575757575758

5155560,4,B008EHZWOU,"It stayed with action you would expect in the Bourne movies. I would recommend it for the action. Three ending faded a little and abruptly came to a close. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the action and locations it took you.",1361577600,,221,4.55
5155561,4,B008EHZWOU,I was anxious to see the movie after I read the book. The movie was very disappointing and I really preferred the book. The book ties up a lot of loose ends.,1361491200,,157,3.9375

5155576,4,B008EHZWOU,"Love Amazon but the fact you can't use captions will keep me from paying to rent many movies. That simple. The quality of the film was great as was the sound but with some cases it's helpful to have captions when the music overpowers the talking. Amazon's menu needs work but as with many companies it's a work in progress. However the lack of captions will limit me to only rent movies I can't find anywhere else, whereas DirecTV is too expensive, Netflix seems to have a better and bigger selection of movies with captions.",1361232000,,525,4.536842105263158

The new star, Jeremy Renner is MUCH more believable as a rugged, rough and tumble super spy.  The story line is,as always, fairly modest marrying the end of the Damon saga to the new.  Lot's of Bourne action, car chases, etc.  If you love Bourne you'll love this.  If you watch Bourne for Matt Damon you may be unhappy - but then again you may need to access your viewing choices.",1361145600,,515,4.204081632653061

5155598,4,B008EHZWOU,"This an entertaining movie. Good photography and plenty of noisy pyrotechnics and a splendid motorcycle chase but it's not as concise and enthralling as Matt Damon's three 'Bourne's'. For one thing the story line is a bit confusing. I've watched this movie three times and I still can't figure out what it's about. Something to do with green and blue pills but what these have to do with anything is a bit of a mystery to me. Our hero is first shown tackling the Alaskan wilderness as a sort of initiation exercise. In this he escapes death by evading a CIA drone which is out to get him. Why is not immediately apparent. How he survives this subzero, snowy jungle is not revealed to us; but he does, which adds to the mystery.

Also,its one of those annoying productions in which the action parts are several decibels louder than the dialog bits which are spoken in a whisper. If you could make out what the characters were talking about maybe the plot would be clearer. It requires a skillful handling of the volume control at all times.",1360886400,,1039,4.55614973262032
5155599,5,B008EHZWOU,This character is easy to empathize with. Loved the action but the acting really drew me in and made it a movie worth watching over and over again. Great job. I highly recommend it.,1360886400,,181,4.352941176470588
5155600,5,B008EHZWOU,Purchased this as a Christmas gift and the receiver was so excited since this was exactly what they wanted.  Unable to comment further since it is up to the person who wants this how to judge.  I can say the person I gave this to would highly recommend the purchase.,1360886400,,266,4.3
5155601,2,B008EHZWOU,"The movie was a bit slow going with no real action scenes that I have come to expect from the Bourne Series. Since I enjoyed the first three I thought this would be of the same caliber. While it does explain the science and maybe ties the first three Bourne movies together, it was rather unnecessary and only real purpose was to bank on the success of the Bourne franchise.

5155603,2,B008EHZWOU,"Not what I expected.  This movie tries to give viewers a feel of Bourne movies but the only things it does is show movie clips from previous ones. The beginning of the movie is slow and predictable and once the whole plot comes ""into"" light you are left hanging.  This was like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and told to tune in next week to see what other crazy things may come up.  Renner and Weisz were good but not real chemistry between them.  It was funny to watch them at the end of the movie get all ""naughty"" with their cheesy lines!",1360800000,,556,4.216981132075472

I had to revisit this movie an hour later in order to watch it in its entirety. The action in this movie was captivating. It stimulated your interest at every turn. I like action movies but only movies that you can involve yourself in with a great story line . In my opinion the story is the movie and this movie meets that requirement. It was good intertainment.,1360713600,,476,4.482758620689655

I fel the movie was cast and acted well.  Some reviewers have commented on some plot holes and storyline ambiguity, but I feel all of the films have similar issues (with or without writer/director intention is speculative).

I was entertained and thought the movie met its objective of providing an entertaining action film true to the Bourne series - while amping up the seriousness characters and action sequences (similar to the recent James Bond reboot series) from the previous films.

5155613,5,B008EHZWOU,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this or not. I thorougly enjoyed the Bourne trilogy.

Jeremy Renner has some real acting talent. Hollywood has obviously recognized this as he has been in several movies since the first time I saw him in the TV series The Unusuals. That was an excellent series but was unfortunately cut short after its first year. Rachel Weisz is an excellent actress and she has gotten even more beautiful if that is possible. She is very believable and does a great job.

I liked Rachel Weisz until this movie - - she is no Cate Blanchett.

When we get toward the end and she is no longer whining and Renner is leading the scenes then, and only then, is she bearable.

5155668,5,B008EHZWOU,"***WARNING - SOME PLOT SIGNPOSTS/SPOILERS AHEAD***

There are two ways to compare this film, in relation to the previous Bourne films, and compared to other thrillers and films generally.

Firstly - how does it stack up against the prior 3 Bourne films, all of which I thought were masterfully executed by all concerned.

Answer: If anything, there was a freshness and an edge to this instalment that a fourth instalment with Matt Damon as Bourne perhaps would have carried less successfully

While Damon is obviously 'Jason Bourne' incarnate, I think it was tactically a very wise decision to leave it at three great films and not chance a fourth (The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull illustrates just how bad a great idea can misfire in execution...).

The difficult thing that the producers/director managed to traverse very well was that the latest film is, as the title says, abour Bourne's Legacy, which suggests, I guess, that it is a tidying up of the mess that unfolded in the previous three instalments,  (the Treadstone Program, unsanctioned black ops, ...).

Jeremy Remner (I think that spelling is correct) is a very different actor on screen to Damon, far less emotion on screen, there was none of the turmoil Bourne was constantly dealing with.

It therefore takes a while to adjust to the switch. But by the time the first major action set piece arrives in which Remner's character can show his wares, I was completely won over.

Remner has assumed the mantle (I don't know whether he would appreciate me putting it quite like that) with characteristic applomb.

Anyone who saw Remner in The Town or The Hurt Locker will know what a tremendous presence and intensity he brings to his roles.

Turning to a comparison to other contemporary cinema releases generally, I can say without a doubt that I thought it was falwlessly put together, great cast also including Rachel Weisz, and David Stathairn and Joan Allen reappear.

I loved especially the way the previous Bourne movies were brought in to the story to show that the unfolding drama in The Bourne Legacy was taking place concurrently with events (in the earlier film at least).

It was quite simply the most enjoyable film I have seen this Australian summer.

I would rate it 5 out of 5. For comparison, I would probably give Skyfall 3.5/5 (the Skyfall story was threadbare by comparison).

Note for parents: There are some fairly disturbing scenes in this instalment, for example where a co-worker with a pistol runs amok in a secure laboratory, which amounts to a gun spree - so as close as this is to the recent shootings in Newtown, (I am typing this in Feb., 2013) parents might like to keep such scenes away from younger eyes.

At the start I wasn't sure what this instalment of the Bourne series would amount to, but it is great to walk into a cinema and not know what is going to happen. By the end credits the next instalment had been set up perfectly, the same closing song we have come to expect kicked in, and I knew I had just seen something where everyone had done a quite brilliant job in every department.

I highly recommend The Bourne Legacy.

I have watched it a few times on DVD since, and have enjoyed it equally as much.

As we say Down Under, the next instalment is shaping up to be '' an absolute cracker'!",1360022400,,3300,4.678200692041522
5155669,3,B008EHZWOU,"This movie won't hold up over time.  There are many holes in it and it seems like they rushed to film it and get it out quickly to make some money.  The good:  Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz had great chemistry and gave top notch performances with what they were given, specifically Rachel Weisz was incredible and really lets loose in this.  The bad:  The first hour of this film may put the average viewer to sleep mumbling, ""What is this?""  Nothing happens, its choppy and barely makes any sense.  The film kicks into high gear in the last hour, but by then it may feel like, too little too late for some.  Jeremy Renner is hardly in it the first hour.  When he is, he's dodging wolves, jumping in water and you can't figure out what his deal is.  There are plot holes scattered throughout this.  Let's not even get started on why it's called, ""Bourne Legacy"" when it has nothing to do with Jason Bourne.  They shoud've called it, ""The Cross Legacy"" for the character Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner.  We all know if they did that or changed the name, then no one would have gone to see this.  They had to capitalize on the Bourne name to pack the theater otherwise this movie would have been lost in the shuffle.  This is also why there are comparisons to the Bourne series because of the name.  Edward Norton is an awesome actor and played a thankless role in this where they could've got any no name to play it.  This felt more like a Sunday afternoon TV movie.

The new guy can act, and is not nearly as super human, but more interesting. Some cool chase scenes, but I wish there were a few more fight scenes. All in all, I would still see another Bourne movie. I think the new guy here is a much better actor - at least in this series, though not as tough in some ways as the Damon character.

First of all the science behind the genetic manipulation and the ""magic"" potions to maintain the newly enhanced mental and physical abilities of this pseudo Jason Bourne is pure hogwash.  This movie is not about Jason Bourne but a ""new, improved"" genetically enhanced successor to Jason Bourne who must fight an even  ""newer"" model to the death.  What is this Superman light or perhaps Spartacus light?  The action sequences will keep your attention, so that gets the movie 2 stars.  The ending is very anemic and cries out, ""We will make another lousy sequel.""

5155706,4,B008EHZWOU,"Jeremy Reinner jumps head first into this reboot of the Bourne Identity franchise, not as Jason Bourne, but as a reasonable surrogate hero. An expansion of the Bourne universe, according to the press release, this fourth entry offers more of the same with equal amounts of pizzazz and thrills. It`s a winning formula, and if it aint broke. Hollywood aint gonna fix it.
 Taking place nearly concurrent with the franchise's previous entry, the Bourne Ultimatum, this time out we follow the exploits of Aaron Cross (Renner). Cross was a part of different black ops called Outcome, but when the Bourne scandal (now there's an interesting unused title) is broke to the press, Treadstone decides to cover their tracks by eliminating all Outcome agents as well. The Outcome agents are genetically enhanced super soldiers, Cross is the only one to escape with his life, but is in need of his stabilizing meds. This leads him to seek out Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who was in charge of the research program, and he finds her in just the nick of time as she about to have her government contract terminated for good. The two have to rely on one another to survive and escape those who are now hunting them.
 The story is as complicated as any other Bourne adventure, and yet somehow easier to follow and more straightforward. This is not necessarily an asset as a lot of the mystery seems to have been let go in favor of even more stunts and shoot outs. The movie does keep viewers tense and on the edge of their seats for the entirety of this fast moving thriller. Even at two hours and fifteen minutes, it feels brisk and is over before you know it. The pacing is so taunt that it's effortless in it's ability to disguise it's failings.
 The breakneck final chase scene, on motorcycles no less through Manila, in particular is one of the best you'll see all year. It's pulsating, suspenseful and exhilarating to the max. It will make the heart beat fast and the blood pressure sore. Finely done and a stirring achievement thanks to the dp Robert Elswit and editor John Gilroy`s fancy know how. The action scenes are the usual quick cuts to help A-list stars look like athletes, but at least the shaky cam is kept to a minimum this time.
 Renner is a thoroughly acceptable substitute for franchise regular Matt Damon. Damon's Jason Bourne is still very much a presence in the film, with many photographs of the actor seen through out, as well so much of the plot hinging on his whereabouts and as the title suggest, his legacy. Renner, who's become well known of late in supporting roles, makes a smooth transition to leading man. I would happily see future adventures starring the talented actor since Damon has in recent interviews hinted at the unlikeness of his returning  to the role.
 Weisz also is in fine form here playing a tough and smart role. Her Dr. Shearing, while not an action hero, is no damsel in distress, either. Weisz is too smart to play stupid roles anymore, she was fantastic and Oscar snubbed in a film last year titled the Whistleblower and notice the way she ditched the histrionically awful Mummy  franchise as soon as she won an Academy Award. She is a top flight actress, beautiful and a wonderful screen presence, I hope they don't make the same mistake as they did earlier with Frank Potente and keep Weisz a integral part of this new series incarnation.
 I've said before that any good thriller depends on the strength of it's villains and keeping with the Bourne formula of excellent character actors playing well written, sneering antagonists this time around we get Edward Norton and Stacy Keach. These two fine actors are enthralling enough to watch in their own right that the only logical complaint could be that we spend too much time focusing on the heroes in this movie. Also as a bonus many of the series past stars, including Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney, pop up in welcome cameos.
 Directed by Tony Gilroy, taking over from franchise helmer Paul Greengrass, Gilroy is a capable director who has showed moments of greatness. His inspired first film was Michael Clayton, one of the best movies of 2007. Gilroy misstepped somewhat with his second picture the over inflated Julia Roberts-Clive Owen vehicle Duplicity. The Bourne Legacy not only gets Gilroy back on track, but has moments that once more hint at the tremendous potential that lie within.
 Gilroy has had a hand in writing the other three Jason Bourne adventures, so it seemed a natural choice for the budding auteur to take the helm. Co-writing this time with his brother, Dan, Gilroy has turned out another adequate workman like script. They keep the proceedings at a steady pace and make Cross an acceptable replacement for the familiar Bourne, a similar cross between James Bond and Harry Palmer. Once again the film raises more questions than it answers, and adds nothing predominantly new to the franchise, it would appear to just lead us into the next series installment but it knows what it is doing and it does it well. This also ranks as the second best man vs. wolf movie of 2012.
 This entry works just fine, unfortunately that's it and really nothing more. Still, it delivers the goods and fans and novices of the series alike should get their money's worth as long as they aren't expecting too much. The biggest question that may be raise is just how long can this franchise keep on going singing the same old song and audiences will keep on attentively listening.

5155707,3,B008EHZWOU,"Well, it's just not really about anything is it. Most of the movie is taken up with Ed Norton trying to explain to everyone they could persuade to come back from the original movies, why they had to kill the operatives. They all looked bemused, as they might, I certainly was. So, its better to wreak havoc and carnage with news crews and emergency services everywhere than allow people to - this is where I got really confused - see a video clip on YouTube of two old men drinking wine (which, even more bewilderingly, they already would have as its... duh! ...on YouTube)? If you ""did"" recognized these guys and joined the dots then you would already be in the know right? Who knows? Who cares? Anyway, Jeremy Renner runs away, and that pretty much sums it up. Was it just me or did anyone else think it turned into Terminator II at one (brief) point?",1359417600,5,853,4.439490445859873
5155708,5,B008EHZWOU,"Right down my isle. If you like action movies with modern technologies twists, this is a great choice. Would watch it again.",1359417600,,124,4.681818181818182

5155710,2,B008EHZWOU,"The trailers made it look like it would be exciting and a fun move to watch, but it wasn't, the first 3 were much better and I can watch them over and over, this is a one and done !",1359417600,,181,3.55
5155711,2,B008EHZWOU,"This movie is a 45 minute motorcycle chase. It has nothing to do with the prior ""Bourne"" movies. It was a waste of time",1359417600,,119,4.0

5155713,2,B008EHZWOU,"ack...had high hopes for this one, but was disappointed...cardboard acting and a plot that kept taking sharp left and right turns made this movie difficult to sit through...let's just say we didn't bother hitting 'pause' when needing a snack or bathroom break...",1359417600,,262,5.261904761904762

5155715,4,B008EHZWOU,"I'm sure most people already know, but Jeremy Renner is NOT playing Jason Bourne. This is not a typical reboot, but more of a story-continuing character reboot. Set after the events of the Matt Damon movies, Renner's character is a product of a similar government experiment at creating perfect soldiers that doesn't go exactly as planned. Glorious shoot-outs and butt kicking ensue. An enjoyable watch.",1359417600,,403,5.2153846153846155
5155716,5,B008EHZWOU,"Why so many bad reviews? As a big fan of the first 3, I thought this movie was perfect. The writers did a remarkable job weaving both story lines together and making you actually care about the characters in one movie. Is Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) or is the director Tony Gilroy another Paul Greengrass? is this what you want - do you really need your camera shaking nausea back?

If you like a well told story (having seen the other 3) and don't mind a little change and better camera work, this is a 5 star movie!

The Treadstone and Black Briar back stories are expanded, the spy thrillers are connected what more do you want, except a sequel and continuing story lines.

If you are longing for Matt Damon and Bourne 4, all I can say is that you must see this movie since the next one can only prove Bourne's Dominion.",1359331200,,849,4.360759493670886

5155721,4,B008EHZWOU,My husband & I loved all the Bourne movies & we really wanted to see this one too. It wasn't as good as the first ones but they never are. It was still worth seeing & I'm sure we'll add it to our Bourne collection.,1359331200,,214,3.7777777777777777

5155724,5,B008EHZWOU,"We loved this movie. Saw it in the theater, ordered the DVD as soon as it was available others may pan it for not being Jason Bourne, but I think it stands well on its own. There is enough material from previous Bourne incarnations to fill in the back story, but then it takes off on its own. The ending is left open enough to allow for further exploration into the Bourne world, but was satisfying enough to close the movie successfully.",1359331200,,438,4.353658536585366

It took forever to load(several minutes), when it finally did it runs you through 10 minutes of bs screens and finally during the movie I paused it briefly and after 45 seconds it cut to a universal screensaver which I was unable to back out of by re-hitting pause or play.  I was forced to hit stop and reload the movie for  another 15 minutes.. Needless to say my friends and I were frustrated.. I have a new and updated Samsung player and have never had trouble in the past..

5155729,4,B008EHZWOU,"I like that the director didn't just make a sequel. This story takes place, around the same time as the last bourne move. It shows potential for another character to pick up where Jason Bourne left off. Plus since the actor the picked to play the role, is getting more work, from a fan prospective he's easy to fallow. As well as being a likable character, he plays an important role to the progressive story arc. I was very pleased with the film.",1359244800,,447,4.397590361445783

I can't tell what's going on, why it is, or why they need to do what they're doing. If a guy in the factory in the Philippines can identify a woman from the US as a fugitive, why couldn't anyone before she left the US ?

5155748,3,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne Identity was startlingly good - it was everything that the James Bond series should have been but never sniffed. The second and third installments were not quite as good, but close.  And despite the understandable departures from the Robert Ludlum books on which they are base, they conveyed the thrill-a-minute experiences of the books.

Just as The Bourne Legacy is not from a Ludlum book (Erik Von Lustbader - is that his real name? - wrote it), it is also not from the Matt Damon-Doug Liman team that made the first three movies must-see action cinema.  It's still an entertaining action movie, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weicz decent. Ed Norton reprises his usual detestable character.  But the plot is predictable and the suspense absent.  But hey, it's better than any Jason Statham movie (guilty pleasures, all of them).",1359072000,,841,4.9361702127659575

5155774,3,B008EHZWOU,"Not a bad movie. It is different than the original Bourne series as the theme of this one is wondering why you are being exterminated versus the original theme of getting back at those who wish to terminate you. There is plenty of action and the necessary female supporting side kick but the blood pumping revenge-heated juice is replaced only by the tension of escape. I enjoyed the film because the acting was not disappointing and the characters were likeable, but the Bourne theme of trying to balance the weight of injustice doesn't really come much to the surface here so there is a lack of satisfaction at the end. A second movie could extract my final judgement.",1358899200,,670,4.686440677966102

I wasn't a big fan of the shaky camera effect, which seemed almost worse in this movie than the other Bourne movies, but since it was in the other movies, I kind of expected it.  My only big complaint is the ending.  As soon as it ended, I was left with the ""that's it?"" feeling.  I was expecting there to be more.  At least with the other movies there was an actual mission that you can pinpoint, but this one didn't really have any resolution or even a hint at the story continuing on in the rest of the trilogy since this was a prequel.",1358899200,,593,4.068965517241379

It's smart and tight, and beautifully constructed. What happens when such a thing is possible? Another First Blood, in a way, The Terminator, and the other Bournes; what happens when you create the killers and the creators are no match for them?

But as in First Blood and the other Bournes the killer thinks, feels, has remorse, and wants to change.

The movie starts out exciting and fast paced, but eventually somewhere along the way it just falls flat.  it has a horrible ending and the plot of the movie made little to no sense at all.  If you're familiar with Anime just imagine Dragonball Z with villains that just keep getting more ridiculously powerful it is absurd what they come up with at times.  That is how I felt about this movie as halfway through they basically release a Wolverine type clone from the X-men movies to chase down Jeremy Renner's character.",1358899200,,673,4.537190082644628

I'm such a ""Jason Bourne"" fan, that nothing less will do.  I thought the way the writer tried this movie and the plot to the past Bourne movie was pathetic to say the least.  It had so many holes in the tie in that it lost me right off the bat!

This was done well as it introduced the original main characters from the Bourne series and somewhat explained the theory behind the story through flashbacks.  I can see this going on as a new series, and Jeremy Renner was excellent.  This would be a good movie to buy so you can watch it repeatedly.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it still isn't as great as the original Bourne trilogy, but it's pretty close.",1358726400,,591,4.288288288288288
5155823,4,B008EHZWOU,The film was action packed and Jeremy Renner played his part well.  The main character was not portrayed as a replacement for the Matt Damon character; Jeremy Renner's character was a continuation of the Bourne conspiracy. I Would watch it again.,1358726400,,246,5.0

5155826,3,B008EHZWOU,"This was a disaster for us.  Count us in on the Bourne list and know that we have the whole set and feel sorry about our purchase of this edition.  I had to watch it the second time just to feel as if I understood it and would not be in a good spot to answer that now.  It was mediocre at best and lacked many of the thrilling parts we have become grown to like.  There were scenes that seemed to last forever with one person chasing another.  I was told years ago by a Hollywood type that extended driving, running, kissing and excessive none verbal scenes were used to put time on the clock instead of paying the writers for writing and for the actors to get paid without having to perform an abundance of acting.

I ran the movie through the Blu-ray at first and the sound was as awful as could be.  It did not appear to have the same coding as the player.  I normally run the volume at 20 for full surround sound; however, with this one I had to crank it up to 25-30 depending on the type of scene.  Normal talking required 30 while action and shoot 'em up scenes had to be lowered to avoid blasting out the sub-woofers.  When I watched it the second time on the regular DVD it was just a crummy movie and too bad I had to actually hear all the wasted movements.

Maybe a 3 star is too high but the movie is just O.K. and not so much to be thrilled about.",1358640000,,1359,4.0335820895522385
5155827,4,B008EHZWOU,"This movie was long awaited by Bourne fans.  After the three movies of the original three-series novels were completed, we said, ""Now what?  Are they just gonna leave us hanging there with Jason Bourne floating in the East River then moving away with a couple of frog kicks into the fade out?"".  Our prayers were answered with ""The Bourne Legacy"".

The premise is that, with Jason Bourne on the loose once again and in danger of exposing the CIA program that created a group of trained assassins, this group of assassins must now be terminated, and the only way the CIA ""handlers"" can accomplish this is to terminate the assassins without them being aware that they are now the targets rather than the killers.  Jeremy Renner's character is ""called in"" for termination, just as the others are, but he discovers what the real purpose of their recall is and fights to stay alive.

This movie isn't as good as the first three, but it IS a good movie and is well worth watching.  We long to see Jason Bourne at work once again, but in truth, we don't even miss him in this movie.  We see his photo on his records, we hear his name mentioned, but we don't really miss him because the story line has moved beyond him.  I've watched ""The Bourne Legacy"" three times since I bought it and I store it in its place of honor, right next to the ""Identity"", ""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum"" on my DVD shelf.",1358640000,,1388,4.476190476190476

Much like the Bourne book trilogy, the movie trilogy should've been left alone.

5155861,3,B008EHZWOU,"Well, Renner isn't Damon, let's get that out of the way. And this is the worst Bourne film, and a obvious money grab. But, it's a entertaining money grab. This film is definitely more of a traditional movie. Differing from the non stop frantic pace of the previous Bourne films.

It's funny, when I started this review I had a 4-star rating in mind. The more I think about it, the less I'm impressed. It probably didn't help that I watched Looper the next day which absolutely stomps The Bourne Legacy in every category. The shelf life on this film is just not there. I can turn on any of the Bourne films when they come on cable these days and fall right into the plot. That just won't happen with this one.

Long story short, if you can try not to judge this film against the previous ones, have a couple of hours, and want to be mildly entertained, give it a shot. Just don't expect to feel like you gained something new from the Bourne franchise.",1358380800,,950,4.331460674157303

The story and writing are good. My only problem is with the direction and editing, which is sometimes quite disjointed. I was very disappointed with the car chase scene, which was far too long and contributes nothing to the story.

5155882,5,B008EHZWOU,"I so enjoyed this movie. I didn't watch the other Bourne movies. I had read the books and the movie adaptations were too divergent for me. I wanted Richard Chamberlain's Bourne, but time and technology had made him obsolete. So, I watched this movie, without any expectations, because I had heard that it was good. To me, it was great. Personally, I am sick and tired of ""loner"" movies; sick and tired of the lone husband or lone wife whom we're supposed to empathize with in his or her quest for revenge. What we get for our empathy are lots of special effects, CGI, high body counts and the tiresome one-liners, with the hero or heroine as unfulfilled when the movie is over as he or she was when it began.

Give me a Neo and Trinity pairing any day (The Matrix); a movie where the man and woman need each other to survive and have that special mixture of chemistry between them to make them overwhelmingly watchable. Hence, Renner and Weisz are what I loved best about this movie.  They were so natural together. They were two people working together against all the adversaries in this story, for one simple goal: helping each other to stay alive.

I also enjoyed the science that created the bionic men and women, the scenes in Alaska and in Manila, especially when Weisz had to look after Renner.  I didn't want this movie to end. I was disappointed to see there was no sequel already in the works. I only hope some smart director will pair those two people in another movie that's worth seeing.",1358208000,,1501,4.507352941176471

Jeremy Renner does a great job, he is an actor that keeps improving and is very credible as a ""Bourne"" lead. The storyline was pretty good, Ed Norton well cast as the bad guy from the Federal Government. Rachel Weisz was a real disappointment however, she is usually a great actress but in this was totally unconvincing not helped by some pretty slack writing for her character. The worst part of the movie was the endless formulaic chase at the end. It just dragged on and on with none of the tension or believability of other Bourne movies. And then... the movie ended, very strange. Maybe it was a setup for a sequel but it left me feeling like I had seen half of a movie.

Jeremy Renner is a worthy heir to Matt Damon's character and the writers manage a delightful cast of nefarious uber-intelligence types that are, by turns, ruthless and befuddled by our hero's resourcefulness and resilience. Edward Norton is specially believable as the dark ""Mr. Fixit"" and you really find yourself not minding the more outlandish action scenes ... yeah, I mean the wolf scene!

5155901,3,B008EHZWOU,"I'm a big fan of the Bourne trilogy (Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum) that starred Matt Damon as the elusive, rogue CIA operative known by his codename Jason Bourne. As such, I decided to watch this film given the success of the first three. This movie is essentially a sub-plot of the Bourne Ultimatum, as most of the events in this film overlap with those of the previous installation. Even if you didn't watch Ultimatum or any of the earlier movies, the plot I think should still be relatively easy to follow, save for some of the details concerning CIA programs and initiatives. Nevertheless, I thought that in the end it still left a lot to be desired, as it failed to tie some of the loose ends of the plot but who knows, there might be an additional Bourne installation. Action scenes are nice, demonstrating many of the main character's skills as a CIA operative in combat, navigation, and logistics.",1358121600,,911,4.7

I think what I am going to do from now on is NOT read those reviews longer than one paragraph because in my opinion, the long reviewers get extremely detailed and even somewhat anal in their descriptions.  This is a MOVIE  This is not a documentary, nor was it conceived to adhere to anyone's standards except for the writer/screenwriter.  If you don't like it, fine.  If you like it, please like it for it's entertainment value, not for how it adheres to someones script as to how it should be.  That's hogwash.  I thought it was an excellent movie, hence 5 stars.  I base this review on it's ability to keep me entertained.  My feelings may or may not be like yours, but that's why we live in a free society.

The scene where he was running on roof tops while the doctor was running from the police has already been done!  The car/motorcycle chase immediately following has also been done.

The other mistake that was made is that I wasn't bonded with the main character.  Unlike Bourne, you didn't know much about Aaron, nor are you invested in him.  So, you don't care what happens to him.

With the many referrals back to Jason Bourne in this version, it was almost like they were asking him to come back.

Had I not seen the other three movies, I would have enjoyed this one more.

Jeremy Renner was unconvincing, and Rachel Weis was just as forced.

He is assisted and assists the beautiful Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as they race for a cure and escape from the evil U.S. government cabal of know-it-alls.

No worries though. Even though Jason Bourne only appears courtesy of stock footage this movie does not disappoint. Viewers are quickly introduced to Aaron Cross, yet another good-guy secret agent on the run from mysterious forces within the US government's department of defense.

A US department of defense task force, headed by Edward Norton, attempts to tie up loose ends from a failed super solider program, and the plot really picks up from there. As secret agents are ""disposed of"" around the globe you really find yourself rooting for Aaron Cross hoping he is able to escape and find the inner peace he desperately craves.

The action is top notch including an amazing chase scene near the end of the movie that is not to be missed.  A+ recommendation to fans of action movies & spy thrillers.",1357862400,,1027,4.885057471264368

5155969,4,B008EHZWOU,"Bourne Legacy, an  action adventure, provided the action and conspiracy found in the past Hour e movies. However, it had a singular purpose of setting up another movie to come. I am no critic and enjoyed the movie for its action and intrigue.",1357862400,,242,4.627906976744186
5155970,3,B008EHZWOU,"I loved the previous Bourne films and think Jeremy Renner is quite the leading man, but this film left me frustrated and a bit sad that Matt Damon is left off screen, as he IS the only Bourne to truly care about. The exposition on this film is tedious, slow and confusing. It's not until they have Rachael Weisz's character deliver a necessary and clarifying monologue in a speeding car that you truly get what the first half of the film was about. The last act of the chase is tired and truly unconvincing. I don't care what meds you're on, you're not likely to know how to drive a motorcycle down a railing, much less stay on the bike if you're a passenger. The whole concept of YET ANOTHER SECRET AGENCY to justify sending an assassin (who has NOT ONE line of dialgoue and his presence is just there to be the EVIL BOUNTY HUNTER WITH AN ASIAN SNEER) into the story at the end was ludicrous and when the film ends, it JUST ENDS with no sense of connection to the overall map the Bourne series created. Ed Norton's character comes in out of nowhere and all he does is bark orders--the one scene where he interacts with Renner's character is limp and doesn't explain much. But the film seems to care less about explanations and just wants to push you to the final act. Even the film's opening just has you going ""HUH?"" as they never really explain the point of Renner being in the snowy wonderland other than it being an ""exercise."" An exercise in what? The use of a pretty environment? The saving graces of this film are Renner and Wiesz. Both are gifted actors and lots of fun to watch. Everyone else is so cookie-cutter that they barely register except to be mean to our tortured leads who hopefully sail into more peaceful waters without a return to the screen. Quit while you're now slightly behind and go find some other spy series to adapt....and please leave Tom Cruise off the casting couch!",1357862400,,1900,4.446991404011461
5155971,4,B008EHZWOU,"I'm a total Bourne fanboy; what can I say?  We'll just get that out of the way.  The absence of Bourne/Damon is a bit of a problem with this movie, but Jeremy Renner does a respectable enough job here to make his character interesting in it's own right.  Still, without Bourne/Damon being around anywhere, the use of the Bourne name in the title becomes something of a stretch.  Be that as it may, once things FINALLY got rolling after some rather tedious opening minutes, the movie took off on it's own momentum and I found it very well done and entertaining.  In addition to Renner's excellent performance, I really enjoyed the work of Rachel Weisz and Ed Norton.  So, the bottom line is that I feel that in spite of the absence of Bourne/Damon, Renner and company managed to pull things off well enough that I look forward to seeing a continuation of this franchise in the future.  This is a very respectable action flick.",1357776000,,925,4.569696969696969

5155981,4,B008EHZWOU,"There were mixed reviews for this one, and its understandable after the Bourne series has reached iconic status in American film culture, and to re-work the series with a new turn can lead some viewers to ask for a U-turn.  Bourne has become the epitome of an understandable spy that we have grown to admire:  super-spy and car-chase finisher extraordinaire, yet with emotional empathy we can see how the consequences of his life go out of control.  We love the tale of his amnesiac state that moves forward to finally divide the moral blur that he has had to work under for several years as a Treadstone operative into reconciling his professional and psychological state.

So when the Gilroy brothers decided to go with a new ""Bourne""-like character, it would be a huge feat to keep the momentum going while retaining the fans for future installments.  They insert rising lead-role actor Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another operative under a new program of operatives (called Outcome) who are enhanced through a regime of drug-treatments that enhance their physical and mental abilities.  When the events of The Bourne Ultimate (2007) break out, one of the heads of the program, Colonel Byer (Ed Norton), decides to shut down the entire thing, including implementing the morally disastrous decision to end the lives of the Outcome operatives who are serving their nation and unknowingly have no access what will happen to them.  Byer believes that the Bourne events will not only exploit the CIA's hidden deep cover programs, but theirs as well, so he seeks a complete ""burn to the ground"" of Outcome and re-build of it.

Cross is targeted, as well as Dr. Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who is one of the main scientists in R&D of the implementation of the drugs.  Cross goes on a Bourne-like hunt for Shearing as his body will have an eventual breakdown from the lack of medication (""chems"") as he is totally dependent on them for survival.

I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a new direction in the Bourne series. I believe that many people were not as happy with the film was because, and rightfully so, it is a Bourne film, so we expect a similar themes, action, and drama that we saw in the first three.  However, as a standalone movie this movie brings something fresh to the table with a new intelligent twist in the spy genre- the implementation of super soldier status among field operatives.  What is the moral, emotional, and physical price of creating spies for the field who are deemed expendable?  Bourne was traversing Europe and America for his memories.  Cross becomes a new hero in his own right because he is left out in the cold by his former employers and is now racing against the clock to get his body and mind back.

In terms of action, it is not original Bourne-like where there are frequent fight and car chase scenes.  But as a movie itself, it does a good job of using the similar themes of the Bourne franchise and going somewhere new with it.  It may not be for everyone, but it does a good job in my book nonetheless.",1357776000,,3048,4.677902621722846

In saying that, I found the setup of the movie quite long in the wilderness. The middle also drags a little relating to the pharmaceuticals story. The end has a great chase scene though that makes up for some of the moments that drag a little.

5156020,3,B008EHZWOU,"Given the commercial and critical success of The Bourne Trilogy, doing a relaunch of the series was a no-brainer. Whether the character of Jason Bourne could/would continue without Matt Damon was the big question. When The Bourne Legacy was announced, there were questions of whether the story would follow the plot of the novel. Starring Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, it bares no resemblance to the novel other than the title.

Renner does a nice job as Cross. He's a believable trained assassin and action star thanks to his successful roles in The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and most recently, The Avengers. He's methodical, smart, lethal, and very athletic--almost unnaturally so. The film's plot runs parallel to The Bourne Ultimatum. The aftermath of Bourne's actions in New York are causing collateral damage and Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is leading the clean-up efforts. He's as secretive as possible and his government/spy lingo is just as elusive to the audience. Filled with acronyms, code words, and projects, without having seen the first three Bourne movies (particularly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B00130UFY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>), you're likely to be completely lost.

The clean-up efforts include eliminating the remaining operatives in the field, one of which is Cross. The story jumps between the spy overlords in Washington and Cross trying to find more of the medicine prescribed in his program. It's here that we're introduced to Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). Dr. Shearing and her team run the medical side of the program (although they're not entirely clear as to what they've been doing). They work to create behavioral modification in the form of a pill, as well as to develop physical improvements on the genetic and neurological level for the operatives.

Through a series of violent events, Dr. Shearing and Cross's paths meet. Promising to help Cross in his search for the medicine, their story advances while Byer works to eliminate both of them. There are some very exciting action scenes, including one of the longest chase scenes in recent memory, lasting over fifteen minutes. Director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, Duplicity) also wrote the screenplay, as well as the previous three Bourne screenplays, so the language of the film is the same. Where the film suffers is the pacing and story structure. The continuous cutting between the Bourne clean-up in Washington and Cross's early exploits slows down the pacing. The film feels disjointed at times and the events in Washington D.C. don't feel as urgent and detrimental to the secrecy of the program as the characters would suggest.

The biggest flaw of the film is the lack of resolution to any of the story-lines. Gilroy must be under strict instructions from Universal to continue the Bourne series in a new trilogy. Everything is left open, ambiguous, or unanswered for the inevitable sequels. In the recent age of turning stories into film trilogies or more to increase profits (i.e. The Hobbit, The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Twilight), Universal and Gilroy have apparently created only one-third of a story. Without the sequels, The Bourne Legacy doesn't feel like a complete film. Despite coherently-directed action sequences and a good script that is well-acted, it's difficult for the film to stand on its own. Where as the first three Bourne films can all be viewed independently of each other, The Bourne Legacy is merely the first piece of a project that's years away from completion.",1357603200,,3621,5.369718309859155

I have no idea if this movie was done by the same director, but the movie didn't feel like a Bourne movie at all.  Aside from a similar premise, the pacing and action were very different.  As a $1 redbox rental I still wouldn't have been overly happy with it.  As a $5.99 Amazon Video Rental I'm very unhappy.

I should say, the quality of the video served by Amazon was superb.  It's Hollywood I'm unhappy with, not Amazon.",1357603200,,549,4.180952380952381

That way, we don't have to act or anything like that."" Jeremy Renner is cool. Maybe his next action thriller will be shot by a non-crackhead cameraman and director.

However, the movie often comes up wanting -- while Jeremy Renner does a great job in the movie, perhaps, the screenplay is not quite as strong as the other films in the series.",1357516800,,307,4.685185185185185
5156044,3,B008EHZWOU,"What do you do when the original director and actor of a successful franchise you're building backs out of the upcoming sequel that's already planned? It's really quite simple. You either replace the lead actor and continue on or you somehow shift the focus of the movie onto another character. How hard can it be to find a director to replace another when the series is already a guaranteed payday?

Universal Pictures made good decisions all the way around with ""The Bourne Legacy."" Instead of concentrating on the character of Jason Bourne, they altered the center of attention to other agents affected by the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs. Enter Aaron Cross, played by newly established action star Jeremy Renner (""Avengers"").

Instead of just replacing Paul Greengrass with some other random director, they chose to go with someone very familiar with the series. Tony Gilroy co-wrote all the other ""Bourne"" films and stepped in to helm and pen the latest entry. He did an acceptable job balancing these two enormous jobs.

I love a great action movie. I also love a good spy thriller. It makes perfect sense that a movie like ""The Bourne Legacy"" would appeal to me. For the most part it did. However, somewhere along the line a feeling of tedium set in. It didn't stick with me throughout the film. It just came and went. Sometimes I think I've seen too many of these types of movies and the excitement has worn off.

One thing I really enjoyed about the film was the sense of realism director Gilroy captured. He doesn't lean on a crutch of CGI like so many of these action films do these days. It reminds me of the newer James Bond films. When you see Daniel Craig and Jeremy Renner jump onto the ledge of a building or cliff and slam into it, you know it hurt. You don't look at the scene and go, ""They used a miniature for that or digitally enhanced it.""

The high-definition transfer of the film gives viewers a pristine picture and an engrossing audio experience. The clarity of the video doesn't compromise the gritty atmosphere the movie holds. The 7.1 surround sound will cause some home theater audiences to jump out of their seat frequently as explosions and gunfire ring out from different speakers.

The Blu-ray edition of ""The Bourne Legacy"" comes with some impressive bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by director / co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy, editor John Gilroy, second unit director Dan Bradley, director of photography Robert Elswit, and production designer Kevin Thompson.

Five featurettes focus on everything from casting to shooting locations and working with real and animatronic wolves. They include ""Re-Bourne,"" ""Capturing Chaos: The Motor Bike Chase,"" ""Enter Aaron Cross,"" ""Crossing Continents,"" ""Moving Targets,"" and ""Man vs. Wolf."" There are also three deleted scenes and an animated storyboard / footage reel titled ""Wolf Sequence Test.""

""The Bourne Legacy"" Blu-ray will give action fans and enthusiasts of the franchise something to satisfy their need for a fresh kick of adrenaline. It does get bogged down at times with plot-pushing dialogue, but you can't really fault filmmakers for wanting to give the audience something with substance. Although it's a great outlet for people to see Jeremy Renner in a very physical action role again, I don't think this will be remembered as one of the better entries in the series either now or in the future.

Matt Damon plays it with much less emotion and as a result I never felt much of his agony or frustration. Jeremy Renner plays it with much more emotion, though with enough restraint you still get the idea this guy is a trained killer. Rachel Weisz is excellent as the nerdy Doctor who steps up to the plate and takes on the bad guys as she should.

5156109,3,B008EHZWOU,"If you are like me, you're looking at Bourne Legacy because of the previous three films. Do not expect the same style of character that you have grown to love with Jason Bourne. Now, the film itself has some great acting, some great action scenes, and a few interesting new twists to the previous story arc. However, it is lacking the intrigue and intellect we've grown accustomed to. If you go in watching this film expecting Aaron Cross to outwit his opponents, as Jason did, you will come out severely disappointed. If you go in expecting to find a character haunted by not knowing his past and therefore following along as confused as the main character is, again you will be disappointed. So take out the ""bourne"" from the title and go in with no expectations and you may be able to enjoy it as a good action movie. I do not want to spoil the plot, but I will mention that the writers have thrown in several key plot points that never existed in the three films and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Why now? Why now do you, writers, suddenly decide that's part of the bourne world? I have seen other films more poorly done as a late sequel, so do not misinterpret what I say as that this is a bad film. It just does not live up to its predecessors and doesn't particularly deserve the word ""bourne"" on its cover.",1357344000,,1321,4.352226720647773

5156114,5,B008EHZWOU,"Here's the lowdown: (a) I liked this movie a lot, (b) liked it better than even The Bourne Identity, which was the only moderately likeable movie in the first trilogy anyway, and (c) thought that it was much more in the spirit, if not in the plotline of Ludlum's books.
Here's a bit of rationale for these statements.
First of all I actually read the original novels, and the Jason Bourne of the original trilogy of movies had little to do, except for general plot-points and miscellaneous McGuffins with Ludlum's. The novels were completely perverted in the scripts when they killed off Marie in The Bourne Supremacy. She was such an integral part of the life of the Jason Bourne character of the novels that I was totally flabbergasted at the screw-ups with the scripts.
Then there were Matt Damon and Franka Potente, neither of whom came even close to being the Jason and Marie of the novels. Nothing against Damon and Potente per se; they just didn't fit. Period.
And then came Jeremy Brenner and Rachel Weisz and it was like ""WOW! They did something right for once."" Maybe the plots weren't even close to anything Ludlum, but the characters certainly were much, much more like the Jason and Marie I recall from the novels. And characters are, after all, at the heart of everything.
Plus, of course, the awfully pretentious and thoroughly nauseating Greengrass cinematography was gone, and so we ended up with a truly enjoyable flick.
And, no, I definitely do NOT want to see a movie where Damon joins Brenner. In fact, here's a chance to pick some storyline from the original novels and let Brenner and Weisz run with it. And keep her alive for goodness' sake!",1357257600,,1665,4.705479452054795
5156115,2,B008EHZWOU,"It ended.  That's it.  But it couldn't be over, could it??  I sat staring at the screen, seeing that there were only a few minutes left, and I thought, ""Please let something MAJOR happen now"".  And it didn't.

Jeremy Renner is perfect for this role. He's believable, maybe even more so that Damon.  I loved watching HIM. I didn't like the story line (if there was one).  I hope Jeremy continues this role, but I hope that everyone else associated with making this movie are asked to step aside.

I can't believe it ended the way it did. How did this movie get approved for release??  Didn't ANYONE view it before sending it out to the theaters?  So sad that such great potential was crumpled up and thrown away, leaving a very talented actor to sit around and look foolish for picking this role.",1357257600,,795,4.458333333333333
5156116,3,B008EHZWOU,"I liked this movie but, it should've come out right after the last Bourne movie with Matt Damon, which would've shown a better connection to the Bourne series.

Better luck next time?",1357257600,,380,4.686567164179104
5156117,4,B008EHZWOU,I'm giving it a four instead of a 5 only because so many of my questions about the Bourne Legacy were still left unanswered.  Guess they will make another sequel...

My husband likes these action movies and I enjoyed this one too as it had more than just action... but some drama as well.,1357257600,,348,4.257575757575758
5156118,4,B008EHZWOU,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Coming off of the fantastic Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon I was a little skeptical when I heard that Damon wasn't going to be in this latest entry, but Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job. Having enjoyed the original trilogy, I was excited when I first heard of Legacy. I never read the books so I was fortunate enough to not have them get in the way of my enjoyment. However I do know that the movies don't really follow the books at all.

The film takes place during the time of The Bourne Ultimatum. Namely, we start at the point when Simon Ross gets shot at Waterloo Station. Now I was a little taken back because I kind of thought this would be it's own separate story, which it is in it's own right, but Bourne is mentioned a handful of times. Although, now that I think about it, I think I enjoyed the film more because they found a way to tie these two stories together.

One of the main issues people had with the original trilogy was the shaky camera during the fight sequences and even during some of the dialogue-heavy scenes. Thankfully that has been improved drastically. During some of the action scenes it does get a little crazy, but it's a big improvement from before. However, compared to the the original trilogy, the action scenes weren't as frequent. The first half was trying to shape the story and get you used to the characters, while the second half really picks up the pace. Which brings me to my next point.

Even though I really enjoyed the film I felt the story was a little weak at times and they didn't always do a great job of explaining why something happened. Which left some scenes feeling kind of pointless. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) seems to be the main antagonist, but they do very little to explain his character or even his job. From the viewers point of view he wants to kill all the participants of Treadstone, but we're left ignorant as to why. At least that's how I felt after watching it.

Even though I did have some small gripes with the story my main problem was that the ending, for me, was a little anticlimactic. I wasn't expecting the film to end after the chase scene and I kind of felt like it just ended abruptly. It did leave possibilities for another film though, which is always nice. I must say that the entire cast did a fantastic job. As I already said Jeremy Renner was amazing and Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz both gave great performances as well.

Overall Score: 8/10 - Overall this really is a solid film. It may not have been as strong as the earlier entries, but it was good in its own right. Aaron Cross was an interesting and compelling character and I look forward to seeing more of him in future Bourne films.",1357257600,,2733,4.423459244532803

Along the way, he saves and protects a research Doc who was working with the bad guys but not asking any questions.
The door was left open for another movie, so I expect to see more from Renner in this series.  The lame part was the referring to Jason Bourne on several occasions, in an attempt to tie the plot together.

Viewers compared this movie to all ""Bourne"" series which Matt Damon was an excellent actor for it.

Still, this movie entertained me to the last bit because the story was different. If you want my opinion. Buy this because it's an excellent addition to your collection.",1357171200,,605,4.5504587155963305

The newest, The Bourne Legacy, was a huge let-down.  After watching it, I felt deflated.  No WOW! factor.  It ended, seemingly in the middle of the movie, without a resolution.  The bad guys don't get theirs, and you you aren't certain if the good guys really got away.  I watched it again, with the closed caption on and got a lot more out of the movie, since much of the dialog was Project Names, Acronyms, etc. and a lot was said under breath, that you couldn't know what was going on until much later in the movie, and too late to bother going back.

The movie starts slow and doesn't give you a story to allow you to relate to the characters or even care about them.

Unfortunately, the movie not only starts slow it stays slow for almost its entirety. It only gets interesting near the end during the chase where you suddenly remember that this is supposed to be an action movie!

As for the movie's conclusion, only 5 minutes after the one and only chase... it's a complete let down. You don't get any closure nor do you feel that you can't wait for the sequel like other movies have done.

5156166,4,B008EHZWOU,Good action - I enjoyed the super-spy power and elegance.  The ending left me a bit unfulfilled but worth a watch for $5.,1357171200,,121,4.260869565217392

5156168,3,B008EHZWOU,I give the whole plot a good 3.5 out if 5. I personally liked Matt Damon to have been in this even just a cameo would have been good. Jeremy Remer and Edward Norton did a good acting job like always.,1357171200,,199,3.8780487804878048
5156169,4,B008EHZWOU,"not as good as the first 3 Bourne movies. seems to be more a side story than a sequel. also in my opinion, the chase scene at climax was a bit too long and it did not seem as exciting as other chase scenes. this is similar to the Tokyo Drift movie of the Fast and the Furious franchise, good movie, but not as good as the originals.",1357084800,,332,3.8970588235294117
5156170,2,B008EHZWOU,"The Bourne creators had a strong trilogy. It wasn't Lord of the Rings, but they had crafted a nicely-woven narrative that finishes the way it begins. Why not exit the stage and leave it alone? Money.

First off, the storyline makes no sense. And once you've thought carefully about the plot, you're left wondering why you should care at all. After watching this movie twice, I still can't figure that out.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone considering buying the movie -- but it is a sexed-up story of someone trying to get their medication. With satellites, drones and assassins mixed in.

If this movie is playing on an airplane, sure, watch it. If the neighborhood mega-store is handing out free copies, sure, take it. (And regift to someone who doesn't mind illogical action.) But don't spend money on this.",1357084800,,814,4.71830985915493
5156171,4,B008EHZWOU,"When I saw this in theaters, I mostly enjoyed it, but I found myself disturbed and I was taken out of the movie experience when the shooting in the laboratory part happened. I stopped being entertained at that point and was soberly reminded of recent shootings all over the country very similar to the one portrayed in the movie. The rest of the movie was enjoyable and I laughed at how unstoppable the really stylish bad guy at the end was. Overall, I enjoyed the theatrical experience other than that one scene that took me out of it. Having stewed on it for a few months, I came to admire the boldness of the inclusion of that scene. I was moved by the fact that because of recent events and the plausibility of a shooting like the one in the movie it was included. It just made the story more believable. So while that scene is still hard to watch, I can respectfully admire the point it is trying to get across. As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the audio was a blast to listen to. I love it when normal scenes take advantage of surround sound in addition to the action scenes. I felt completely immersed in the movie. The picture quality was great and the film grain was intact the whole time. As far as the extras are concerned, I watched every last bit of them. The audio commentary was worth a listen, but I won't be returning to it any time soon. The participants talked over each other a lot and also alluded to a lot of personal anecdotes without really going into what they meant. But, it was also really informative on certain scenes, especially the scene at Marta's house. I found about half of the commentary very interesting and the other half was nonsense. The rest of the special features were great, their only downfall being that there are not more of them. That said, the best buy exclusive disc did not have anything that compelled me to get that version. It seemed like mostly fluff stuff. So if anyone has that version, they should post what they think of the exclusive content. Overall, worth the purchase. It holds up well to repeat viewings and the Blu-ray is top notch. Make sure and watch the deleted scenes, they add some nice flavor. As far as PG-13 content goes, this movie earned it for a bunch of violence and some language. I would preview it before showing it to younger kids, due to the disturbing nature of a few of the scenes (what the people try to do to Marta at her house, and the laboratory shooting in particular). On a final note, this movie fits in perfectly with the other Bourne movies. Enjoy and thanks for reading!",1357084800,,2567,4.429175475687104

Think of the Russian police that he left alone.  Aaron, in contrast, basically killed everyone in his path. Think of the Filipino guards.  Finally, Aaron's motives were selfish - he was desperate to get meds so he would not become stupid again. In contrast, Jason was trying to figure out, and rectify, his past.  That is much more morally compelling.

5156192,3,B008EHZWOU,"For the fourth film a series, this film has a ton of exposition, which is appropriate considering they are introducing a new lead character. For much of the film's running time, it plays out like a tense white-knuckle spy thriller. A cat and mouse chase game that we've seen before, but always seems to entertain when it is done well as it is in this film. At the last half hour things change gears and we are treated to an extended action sequence that goes on about 10 minutes longer than it should and then the film suddenly ends. There is no real resolution to anything that came before it, presumably so you'll rush out when the inevitable sequel arrives. I had a blast at least with the first bit, and I recommend for streaming purposes only. A bit of a warning, there is a particularly shocking scene involving someone shooting up their workplace that happens about 30 minutes into the film that, in wake of New Town, could be rather provocative.",1357084800,,953,4.546511627906977

5156201,3,B008EHZWOU,"Sequels always invite comparisons especially when they change main characters. Also the only thing ""Bourne"" about this film is the legacy part. Bourne's out of the picture (sorry), and is replaced by his legacy, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner). Actors from past Bourne movies include Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Albert Finney. Ed Norton, Stacy Keach and Rachel Weisz are added to the credits.

This is a movie you have to watch very closely. One bathroom break or trip to the refrigerator and you're done. You will not figure this out if you fast for a month and seek the answer in a vision. I finally pick up an idea of what the movie is about with Ed Norton's character who is trying to contain a Tread stone-like descendant operation, Operation Outcome that he is afraid will get out of control with scandalous outcomes. (Sorry again). The only way to do that is to kill the next generation of agents who are chemically engineered to perform significant feats of prowess and bravery. Rachel Weisz, stunning as ever, is Doctor Marta Shearing, or Doctor Death, as I like to call her. She administers dose and drug to the agents, and almost becomes a victim of the program when one scientist targets other scientists, killing everyone but her. The CIA sends another team pretending to be concerned caregivers to help her kill herself.

Enter Aaron Cross who comes out of nowhere and we see the first real hand-to-hand combat action that is even more awesome as they increase camera speed until you can't even follow the blows and blocks anymore. Cross and Shearing join forces to discover why they have been targeted for elimination. The trail takes them to Manila with the Police and an assassin rounding out a great chase scene that begins on foot and ends up in motorcycles.

The beginning of the movie is slow before going bipolar with a pace and script that is hard to follow. Flashbacks to previous Bourne movies and characters try to tie in the past (Bourne) to what's going on today (his legacy). If you haven't seen previous Bourne adventures, it can obfuscate as easily as clarify.  The best part for me was the mortal combat, the wolves, the sound during chases, and the part in Alaska. The worse part for was the plot, the story, the script, the pace, and the part in Alaska.

You may have to watch this twice before you understand it, and three times before you like it.

For me, this was Operation Gall Stone.",1357084800,10,2435,4.677570093457944

5156241,3,B008EHZWOU,Great scenery but the plot is subpar. The Bourne series is too one sided in painting these balck ops as totally evil. Would have been better if it left the viewer with a more complicated choice whether the programs they talk about are good or not.,1356998400,,247,4.391304347826087
5156242,5,B008EHZWOU,"I bought this movie because I loved the The Bourne Movies. I was somewhat sad to not see Jason Bourne in this one as well. However, they have made the Bourne movies more interesting by adding Jeremy Renner into the series. He brings in a whole different view on what is going on in the Bourne Movies.",1356998400,3,300,4.280701754385965
5156243,3,B008EHZWOU,Not up to the caliber of the first three Bourne movies. Not a bad movie - just below our expectations based on the Matt Damon versions.,1356912000,,135,4.230769230769231
5156244,3,B008EHZWOU,"I have the other bourne movies, but i didn't like this one. it was poorly made the story was there, just not fully developed",1356912000,,124,4.208333333333333
5156245,5,B008EHZWOU,"Great movie, Jeremy Renner was great - I think even showed Matt Damon up a bit.  Definitely can see more sequels from this one!",1356912000,,127,4.291666666666667
5156246,2,B008EHZWOU,Quite disapointed in this film. Just a remake of the other Bourne films with different actors. Glad I didn't waste my $$ at the movies. The motor bike chase scene was SO long I fast-forwarded through a lot of it and it was so unbelievable. Glad it was on sale.,1356912000,,260,4.22
5156247,1,B008EHZWOU,I have loved all the previous movies. I was apprehensive about watching this movie in the first place. I should have listened to my gut feeling. This was horrible. It took almost an hour before the first fight scene. This movie is definitely a lead up to a following film in all honesty I say skip this movie. It just is not worth the money nor the time.,1356912000,3,354,4.220588235294118
5156248,2,B008EHZWOU,"This film is a poor imitation on the original Bourne series.  Then again, I wasn't a fan of the second or third Bourne films either.  The first film was a novel idea about a programed evil ""superman"" who discovers his powers and his goodness.  The subsequent Bourne films have been just a repetition of the first film.",1356912000,,318,4.543859649122807
5156249,2,B008EHZWOU,"This film, lacks the cerebral and intellectual content of the other Bourne films. It seems focused on car chases and explosions, without the substance. The premise is fantastic, but I would have liked to know more about the experiments and also more of the inside CIA operation. Edward Norton is good, and Jeremy does fine although he is no Jason Bourne.
If I had known this was just another mindless action flick, I would not have wasted my time.",1356912000,,447,4.670886075949367
5156250,3,B008EHZWOU,"But this was largely a meh experience.  In the Matt Damon helmed Bourne movies there is always a very clear rationale for why things are happening on screen.  In this version, we're meant to feel bad for Jeremy Renner but I never really bought into the Flowers for Algernon story line.  Edward Norton (who even knew he was in this movie) is totally underutilitized.  I thought they had a nice setup with the story parallelling the last Bourne movie, but it didn't really go anywhere and man does the movie just end with a dud.",1356912000,,526,4.505263157894737
5156251,4,B008EHZWOU,Not as good as the 3 previous Bourne movies but kept my interest.  Renner is very god and there is an awesome motorcycle chase.  Worth a rent at least.,1356912000,,151,4.172413793103448

5156253,2,B008EHZWOU,"If you shut your brain off, this is a great action movie.  However, the underlying political premise that our government kills it's own agents at the first sign of liability is completely ridiculous.  Did Michael Moore come up with the idea for this plot?",1356912000,,255,4.7727272727272725
5156254,5,B008EHZWOU,The characters are much better than the previous Bourne movie.  Looking forward to see the new one with even more character development and of course the actions are fantastic!!,1356912000,,177,5.103448275862069
5156255,4,B008EHZWOU,Another hit from the Bourne series. This one is almost as good as the others before it. Jeremy Renner does a fine job as the latest super soldier.,1356912000,,146,4.25
5156256,1,B008EHZWOU,"I liked the actor, but a mediocre follow on. For me actors were okay, story fell flat. Can't just wreck cars, fire some weapons and call it a movie...oh wait...Skyfall did the same thing!",1356912000,3,187,4.529411764705882

5156258,4,B008EHZWOU,They found a way to continue the series while changing our main character. I compare them to the series of James Bond films..where there is a new actor playing our hero every 3 film's with no explanation as to how or why this happened. The Bourne series is about our own government making kill squads and the politics and actions of covering them up when they go south. excellent series.,1356912000,,387,4.542857142857143
5156259,4,B008EHZWOU,To me this is the best Bourne movie yet. The plot was more interesting than any of the previous versions and wasn't dominated by special effects.,1356912000,,145,4.615384615384615
5156260,3,B008EHZWOU,"Good action movie, the ending was kinda abrupt. The movie is very similar to Bourne movie series, nothing really new.",1356912000,,117,4.9
5156261,3,B008EHZWOU,"Good try, but didn't hit the mark.  I completely understand why they made this movie and was really hoping it's surprise me.  It didn't.  I found it predictable and occasionally boring.  Too bad they burned down that gorgeous old house...bummer.",1356912000,,245,5.05
5156262,2,B008EHZWOU,"While this movie was a disappointment, I have to say, there were a lot of great things about this film.  First and foremost, the action was spectacular.  A combination of artistic cinematography, graceful and intentional editing, and well-paced choreography made for some stellar action scenes.  The Bourne movies are well known for their great fast-paced, quick-cut action scenes, and this film does not fail to continue that style.  I would dare to say that the action alone in this film warrants a viewing.  One scene in particular caught my eye.  It was a scene where a doctor shoots up the lab he is working in.  This was a very terrifying scene, even for a PG-13 rating.  It felt very realistic and although it was a dark scene, it was very well done.  A more subtle element I liked about this film was the continuation of the water theme.  Every Bourne film starts with a water theme, and they continued this into the fourth film.  It helps connect the films in a way and I really liked that.  I also liked the cast of Edward Norton, although I wish I would have seen more of his character.  Rachel Weisz's performance was good, although I greatly disliked her character.  All her character did was scream, yell, and beg for Aaron to save her in several points in the film.  I was indifferent about Jeremy Renner.  I liked him as an action star, but I don't think he or anyone else for that matter should be taking the place of Matt Damon.

Other than the action scenes, this film lacked many of the elements that made the first three Bourne films so good, specifically the pacing.  This movie was EXTREMELY slow for a Bourne film.  There was probably 15 minutes of solid action in this movie, and I expected more from a Bourne movie, whether Matt Damon starred or not.  The trailer gave away most of the good parts of the film, which is probably why I was so disappointed.  Also, for whatever reason, Matt Damon's character was repeatedly brought up throughout the film.  If we're not going to see him on screen, there's no reason to bring him up.  Every mention of Jason Bourne made me think about how cheap the writers were being trying to transition from one actor to the other.  Another complaint I had was how awkwardly the movie ended.  Immediately after an intense motorcycle chase, we are suddenly on a boat in the ocean with Aaron and Marta, and they escape, more or less, away from everything.  It seemed like there were some loose ends that needed to be tied up, rather than jumping straight from the climax of the film to the end.  That was a very jarring way to end the film and left me with a bad feeling walking out of the theater, which is something good filmmakers never do.

The latest Bourne film is more of a redundancy than a legacy.  I'm not saying that Matt Damon's absence from this film is the reason it wasn't very good, but it's hard to watch a movie of this caliber with a well-established star without having him in the back of your mind.  It is easily the weakest of the Bourne films, however, I would recommend giving it a watch solely based on the fact that the action scenes were great.",1356912000,,3127,4.483185840707964
5156263,4,B008EHZWOU,"Great addition to the Bourne movie series. Action packed, non-stop thriller that is everything great about the Bourne movies. Additionally will lead right into the next movie of the series.",1356912000,,189,5.333333333333333
5156264,3,B008EHZWOU,My hubby is a BOURNE freak and we have watched every single movie.  It's just not the same without Matt Damon and the story line was okay but REALLY SLOW to get to the point.  There was alot more action in the other movies than this one.  Even my husband said it was okay.  And just when you think it is starting to get somewhere the movie ends!,1356912000,,345,4.029411764705882
5156265,4,B008EHZWOU,The movie has everything you would expect and more from this type of action film. A must see if you've seen the other two.,1356912000,,122,4.125
5156266,1,B008EHZWOU,"This movie went nowhere. The acting was good but the storyline and directing were horrible. For me, it was even worse as I loved the original three. Complete waste of time and money.",1356912000,4,182,4.545454545454546
5156267,4,B008EHZWOU,Great movie but not as good as the previous Bourne Ultimatum. Starts off slow but eventually builds in intensity. Ending leaves the door open for the next part,1356912000,,159,4.714285714285714

5156269,4,B008EHZWOU,Anyone expecting to see another great movie with Matt will be disappointed.  The plot is messed-up and quirky.  All that being said once you get beyond the first fifteen minutes of the movie it becomes another global chase adventure around the world.  So sit back and forget about the past and enjoy the ride.,1356912000,,309,4.685185185185185
5156270,4,B008EHZWOU,"of course i chose because it's a ludlum book.  gritty, good, fast paced, typical ludlum fare so I consider it a good watch.  actually this character is probably closer to 'real' than pretty boy matt damon who did a good job as bourne.  if there is a sequel?  I'm there.",1356912000,,269,4.32
5156271,3,B008EHZWOU,It left me hanging at the end of the movie. Maybe there will be another one?? The action was still pretty good compare to the 3 before it.,1356912000,,138,3.9642857142857144

5156273,4,B008EHZWOU,"As other reviewers noted, story and characterizations are done well, and breaks away cleanly into a new story arc. Renner has done an excellent job, but direction does not stand up to the high standards set by earlier releases. Camera work is better than the earlier ones - it used to swing and jump so much during action scenes in the earlier installments that it gives a headache.

Engaging story, excellent acting and action, good entertainment. Unfortunately not enough to make it a cultish favourite.",1356912000,,505,4.9411764705882355

5156280,4,B008EHZWOU,"I felt the movie started a bit slow, but once it got going, it was non-stop action.  I realize they needed time to set up how Aaron Cross fits into the Bourne mythology.  Looking forward to the next one.",1356825600,,203,4.17948717948718

5156282,1,B008EHZWOU,"Pro: Awesome Alberta posing as Alaska winter scenery.
Con: Everything else about this derivative, pointless rip-off.
The only thing ""Bourne"" about this movie is the promoter's desire to ride Ludlum's coat tails.  Yes, I know, the Bourne movie trilogy wasn't true to the original novels, but at least it had some resemblance to the story line.  The 4th ""reboot"" is something else, and that something is no part of Ludlum's Legacy.",1356825600,10,429,5.028169014084507

5156284,3,B008EHZWOU,"The action in this movie is rare, and when it does get to the action it's not as well written as the previous Bournes. I think the biggest mistake this movie has is not keeping Matt Damon in the series. If you've seen the Bourne movies before, you know what it's about so there was no reason for the long talk and explanation in the first half of the movie. Obviously there should of been more action. And what's up with the ending, is it supposed to make you think another Bourne movie will follow? Anyways, when you have a good actor like Matt Damon doing a great job, why throw in a different main actor? I was hoping Jason Bourne was going to finish what he started...What the heck...??? Other then that some action scenes were great, some good acting.",1356825600,,756,4.368794326241135

5156288,4,B008EHZWOU,It was not as good as the other Bourne movies but they really tried to incorporated with the rest of the series.  I think that it could of had a better storyline  to explain the new program instead of the sexual chemistry build up like the first Bourne movie. On the plus side it is a action packed and explosive movie. If it was a stand alone move it would have been a 5 star movie!,1356825600,,383,4.026315789473684

I was all set to give it 5 stars until the very end when it was left rather open-ended and clearly inviting another sequel to be made. Still a great movie and well-enjoyed by men and women alike.

5156298,4,B008EHZWOU,"Excellent action movie in the ""Bourne"" tradition.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the rooftop/building chase scene at the end.  I've seen that so many times.  The motorcycle chase was exceptionally well done.  The sound was a bit spotty too.  When I would get the sound loud enough to hear the characters talking, suddenly a bomb or gunshot would blast through the room at an unbearable level.

I've always liked Rachel Weisz and like her here as well.  This is my second favorite of the series, after the original. I liked ending, which mirrors, to a degree, the end of the first of the series. I've read several critiques of the film, but don't agree with most of the complaints.

A bit confusing by interspersing scenes from former movies in a disjointed manner. Not truly enough backround to be relevant.  Hard to accept the new character after 3 Bourne films with Damon.

5156344,2,B008EHZWOU,"The plot was borderline incomprehensible even for a movie where the plot is of secondary interest.  The need to cash in on previous Bourne movies made the whole experience rather cheesy, and interesting ideas about genetic engineering were lost in the shuffle.  Abrupt ending, and a waste of good talent from Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Ed Norton.  Renner and Wiesz had little chemistry, a likely outcome of the questionable film making.  Fairly pointless character development just to have an action sequence or explosion.  Rent Skyfall when it's available on Amazon; now there's good espionage and conspiracy and good action.",1356652800,,632,5.28
5156345,4,B008EHZWOU,I wasn't sure what to expect since I'd only seen the previews.  The action was pretty non-stop and the premise was good enough to go with it for the entertainment value.  It's probably the most dialog I've heard from Jeremy Renner.,1356652800,,231,4.609756097560975

5156347,2,B008EHZWOU,"What a difference a director and actor make. Paul Greengrass perfected his frenetic, hyperactive technique with the Bourne Ultimatum, which made the original Bourne Identity look a little tame by comparison. The brilliant masterpiece that was Ultimatum stands in stark contrast to this well-meaning effort, which, despite a lot of time, money, and talent, falls flat. A big chase scene at the end does not a movie make. Also, if you are not completely familiar with the first three movies, you will be lost.

If I described the first half of this film to you, with its multiple subplots and frantic cross-cutting, you'd think it sounded pretty good. In reality, it is leaden, full of limp scenes that fail to have the intended effect. At this stage in action movies, watching a guy hiking Alaska and climbing cliffs is not particularly exciting, despite the cross-cutting to show us what was going on in the next room during the last half hour of the Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, much of the first half is glacial. One can only imagine what the editor's big brother, director Tony Gilroy, gave him to work with if this was the best he could do.  Scenes mostly never generate the feelings we assume they were going for. For example, Aaron Cross's sojourn with another mysterious program agent in a remote cabin is clearly supposed to be tense and suspenseful, but it plays out like we are forced to watch two closeted men set up on an awkward blind date. A visit to Rachel Weisz's lab is similarly boring. An interrogation scene features assassins so skillfully playing caring therapists that the suspense never builds properly.

Another part of the problem is Jeremy Renner, a fine actor but not a particularly likeable one. His odd, pop-eyed looks make him appear slightly R-word, which, we learn, his character was until genetically engineered by the world's cutest scientist. So our hero's motivation is merely to keep getting the drugs that prevent him from regressing back into Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel. Gone is the ongoing battle between Jason Bourne's programming to kill and his resurgent sense of morality, replaced here by a junkie's need to get his next fix. In a deleted scene, we see that, if necessary, Cross is perfectly willing to stab to death an innocent State Trooper who stops him for speeding. Hardly a hero to root for.

As for ""finishing what Bourne started"" as the tag line proclaimed, nothing like that happens. In fact, by movie's end, we are set up for at least two more sequels, as the villains appear more powerful and untouchable than ever, with poor Pam Landy hung out to dry and Noah Vosen back in the game.

There is a terrific motorbike chase at the end and a scary look at where your prescription might actually be coming from, but, as said before, that does not a movie make.",1356652800,,2813,4.756147540983607

5156369,3,B008EHZWOU,Jeremy Renner does a good job with his character but the whole storyline is lacking the usual Bourne punch.  The movie ending sneaks up on you and leaves you trying to comprehend what was the point of the whole picture.  The tie-in with the last movie is weak to say the least.  Another sequel has to clarify what the heck you just witnessed and where it's headed to from here!!!!!!,1356566400,,382,4.428571428571429
5156370,1,B008EHZWOU,"Bourne Legacy but NOT Bourne!

I just finished watching the latest from the Bourne-franchise and I finished with mixed emotions. Does it have a great cast? Sure! Is the story-line even passable? Absolutely! Is the action well-made? Certainly! Is it high-paced? You bet! Is this a great Action-flick or isn't it? Oh yes!

But a Bourne-movie its not. First of all it doesn't ad anything to the Bourne-universe but merely retells the story from the original movie - Bourne Identity - and even worse: How the h... is it ever going to be a Bourne-movie without Jason Bourne? I thought I could see past that, but I can't.

In the end I have to conclude: Great Action-flick which unfortunately is missing the essence of Bourne. If you can look past this you are in for a treat. If you can't you will be disappointed. I was!

So where does that leave the Bourne-franchise? That remains to be seen! Right now however it looks DEAD.  Sorry fans!",1356566400,2,935,4.608433734939759

I thought there would be a bit more fighting scenes and such ( a Bourne movie staple) and he didn't fight the operator they sent after him (also a Bourne movie staple), but it was good. It was different to have a character who knew who he was and why he was there and that took some getting used to as well, but it was a good introduction to the new character. And for people who can't figure out why the movie title is The Bourne Legacy without Bourne being in the movie obviously don't know the definition of the word 'legacy'; although I don't believe they played that up at all to the level that was suggested in trailers and interviews with the actors. That was kind of a pet peeve while watching. If this was all started with Bourne (thus LEGACY) then why didn't they flesh that out a little more?

The big issue here that kept this movie from being a 5 star film was that it took well over an hour to set up the plot in the story line and the film was too long as a result.  The premise of the movie was very good and it contained enough sub plots that this movie had a great potential.  We gain insight into the reasons Jason Bourne seemed to be super human but there is too much detail into the government's cover-up of the technology.

 My wife and I still liked the movie but it just developed too slowly and it took too long to get to the plot in the storyline.  The action scenes and the acting make the movie worth watching but it just doesn't provide the fast paced continuous action that the first three movies had.

If you like the Bourne stories then you should watch it as it does provide interesting insight into the program that created Jason Bourne.  I rate this movie as 4 stars.",1356566400,,962,4.162162162162162

Aside from the traditional car chases, fist fights, and shooting, the first part of the movie jumps around enough to keep you guessing about how all the disparate scenes tie together.  By mid-movie, you have a pretty good idea of the plot and how it will unfold.  By the end, you wish the plot had developed much further.  The movie does a great job of setting up the next few movies from the Bourne franchise by leaving you with more questions than answers.  If you liked the first three movies, you'll love this one.  If not, you won't.",1356566400,,770,4.543478260869565

5156392,5,B008EHZWOU,Great action packed movie.  It was good seeing some of the old bad guys from previous Bourne movies.  They  are really evil.  The Amazon price seemed a little high but more convienient that driving to Red Box and only paying $1.00.  The other problem was that it took over 2 hours to download the movie onto my TIVO-HD before I could watch it.  Yes I have high speed AT&T fiber optic internet connection but not the highest speed.

The movie maintains a sense of action suspense throughout but I think it takes away somewhat from the climax, in that I was surprised when the movie was over. Use of montage to set context was heavy-handed. Action was solid though I'm not really sure I buy into the way they tied the story into the original 3.

5156402,3,B008EHZWOU,A decent chase scene or two but not worth the 2+ hours.  The plot was thin and it took a while for the movie to get moving.  This movie did not live up to any of the previous Bourne's.,1356566400,,184,3.6923076923076925

5156425,5,B008EHZWOU,"As an early fan of the Bourne movies (I rated Identity a five star in 2002), I like this movie very much. It gave me the same thrill and satisfaction as the previous installments did, which are essentially good espionage conspiracy plots well packaged with great actions and high paced cinematograhy. As a professional businessman, I love it even more. With Damon's refusal to act as Bourne for a fourth time and under the pressure from Universal to take advantage of previous successes worldwide, I am obliged to praise the superb intelligence and skill of the screenwriter turned director Tony Gilroy (he wrote for all three previous ones) for the completion of such a high quality action movie leveraging on storylines of Ultimatium yet without compromsing the overall style and structure, whilst maintaining the upside in case Damon agrees to return or Renner is accepted in his new hero role as Aaron Cross. Certainly the outstanding acting of Weisz and Norton had added much value and attraction as well. Whilst many reviewers criticized that the two Oscar grade star actor and actress should not have taken part in this overstretched extension, I applaud their wisdom to appreciate the potential of it. IMHO, the final product and the updated worldwide boxoffice $276M (vs a $125M budget) had proved them right though it's still far below the $443M of Ultimatum. BTW, the chase scenes in Manila are superb! In short, highly recommended! Looking foward to a fifth or even sixth addition from either Damon or Renner, hoping that the coming one(s) will be as good as this!",1356480000,,1576,4.950943396226415
5156426,4,B008EHZWOU,Enjoyed the action. It followed the series and add a new element. Can't wait for the next one. Worth it.,1356480000,,104,4.25
5156427,5,B008EHZWOU,Good action film. The fact it had a new star was not a problem. I had seen the previous three and was not disappointed.,1356480000,,119,4.0

5156431,2,B008EHZWOU,Entire movie is about Jeremy Renner trying to get pills.  Little to no plot or substance.  Chase scene at the end of the movie seems to last for about 40 minutes. One of the worst big budget movies that I have ever seen.  Save your $5 and rent something else.,1356480000,,259,4.14
5156432,5,B008EHZWOU,"This definitely built on the Matt Damon character, and presented a likeable character in the latest adventure.  Car chase and he got the girl, what else could you want?",1356480000,,168,4.793103448275862
5156433,3,B008EHZWOU,"Interesting plot but the close quarters, fast-cuts just wore me out.  I would have enjoyed more had they kept the camera still and made the cuts twice as long.  Hard to tell who/what/where when the cuts were so fast.",1356480000,,216,4.512820512820513
5156434,5,B008EHZWOU,I loved the Matt Damon Bourne movies so was a bit skeptical of Renner and this character.  Renner nails it!  He does an excellent job of living up to the high marks earlier Bourne films have achieved.  His character is believable without being over the top.,1356480000,,257,4.543478260869565
5156435,5,B008EHZWOU,"Maybe call it ""Cross Purposes""  or in combo with Matt Damon called ""Bourne Again: Cross Purposes"".  LOL

In all seriousness, whether alone or with Matt Damon any film backed by the same producers and writers with the wonderful Jeremy Renner would have to be great.  Jeremy Renner is definitely on my ""must see"" list no matter what film he's in.",1356480000,,344,4.683333333333334

5156437,4,B008EHZWOU,"This film really filled the bill for a change of pace from many of the recent Indie films we have been watching.  Lots of intricate details requiring full attention.

5156438,3,B008EHZWOU,"The end felt like it ended in the middle of the story. It needed at least 20 more minutes to conclude the movie. I hate non endings, and this movie takes the cake.",1356480000,,163,3.9696969696969697
5156439,4,B008EHZWOU,I liked it but the chase scenes were ridiculously long and far too frequent. It felt like filler - I would have rather had the story and dialogue connect more to the earlier movies than watch at least 30 minutes of chase scenes.,1356480000,,228,4.325581395348837
5156440,4,B008EHZWOU,"I say not as realistic because in the first three Bourne movies Matt Damon played a part that was more believable.
Jeremy Renner portrays one of a group of ""super"" agents having super human abilities. So while it was a fun watch it was over the top for me as far as believability goes.
If you have not seen the first three Bourne movies you won't have a good idea of what's going on in this one.
The first three films while making the agaents look nearly superhuman were still more or less believable. The things they did seemed more or less possible. But 'Legacy' goes well into the realm of SiFi.
Again However - it was a fun watch.",1356480000,,634,4.291666666666667

5156443,1,B008EHZWOU,The Borne Legacy is copy cat writing that lacks imagination. Is hardly worth watching. Lacks a plot and what it does have is hard to follow. Save your time and money - avoid this one!,1356480000,2,183,4.257142857142857
5156444,3,B008EHZWOU,"The first 3 are better...hopefully they do another with Jason Bourne.  Renner is good and believable, Weizs is good as well.  But script had gaping holes.",1356480000,,154,4.884615384615385

5156446,2,B008EHZWOU,"While the film has some good acting and decent action sequences, the story is a muddled mess that not only fails to advance the Bourne franchise, but manages to diminish the saga.

The ending in particular is weak and unsatisfying. The producers were obviously hoping to set up another series, forgetting that audiences need to enjoy the first movie before they'll buy a ticket for the sequel. Take a pass.",1356480000,,406,4.8
5156447,5,B008EHZWOU,I wasn't sure what to expect with this being a new character. It's definitely leading to be a possible second with this character. I liked the movie overall.,1356480000,,157,4.642857142857143
5156448,3,B008EHZWOU,"Renner is very good, and the action sequences are well done.

5156450,1,B008EHZWOU,The premise of the plot is idiotic.  Decent actors phone-in their performances.  The directing by Gilroy is 1/20th of what Greengrass did on previous Bourne movies.  This was a forced studio script to capitalize on the excellent acting by Damon.  Renner is not convincing as someone remotely capable of being a super-assassin/agent.  Weiss' acting is as flaccid as a pancake.,1356480000,2,375,5.183333333333334
5156451,5,B008EHZWOU,Great new story line to the Bourne series. I have read all the books and these are always non stop action and intrigue.,1356480000,,119,4.217391304347826

5156453,4,B008EHZWOU,"I chose this rating because the movie was great, but not excellent.

5156455,4,B008EHZWOU,"I saw bad reviews for this movie, and those reviews made me want to see ""The Bourne Legacy"" because they were along the lines of, ""It's too slow, too much character development."" And that's exactly what I want in a movie like this! Jeremy Renner is excellent as the lead character, and ably supported by the wonderful Rachel Weisz. Then you throw Ed Norton in the mix and you have a riveting and intriguing action/spy/thriller that raises a lot of question about boundaries, both political and philosophical, and leaves you longing for more.

It's very much a Bourne movie, but with better camera work (yes, the last two Matt Damon ones left me a little nauseous from the ""realistic"" camera shake). Thoroughly recommended, and waiting for the follow-up.",1356480000,,753,4.8828125

5156460,2,B008EHZWOU,This Bourne movie is a mistake.  Why would you ruin the good franchise with this add-on movie?  Just because Jeremy Lenner is casted doesn't mean the movie will be good.  Ugh.,1356480000,,175,4.580645161290323
5156461,2,B008EHZWOU,"The plot was derivative of past Bournes. Further, it never grabs you.  I never found myself wondering what would happen next.  Basically, it lacked any real tension.  While it was good that they tried to tie in the previous Bourne plots, they didn't clearly delineate early whether this was a replacement, like Bond, or a new character.  I would recommend that you should wait and watch it on free TV.",1356480000,,401,4.685714285714286

While it did not seem quite as suspenseful and full of action as the originals, it was by no means a let-down.  There are nice tie-ins with the original series, and all-in-all, a great addition to the Bourne series.",1356480000,,308,4.5636363636363635

5156473,4,B008EHZWOU,"Though The Bourne Legacy isn't quite as compelling as it's preceding trilogy, it's still a well-acted and exciting action film. Jeremy Renner takes the reins of the franchise as Aaron Cross, a field operative with ties to Treadstone and Jason Bourne. The film isn't exactly a sequel to the the original Bourne films, as it takes place during the same time period as the Bourne Ultimatum. The script is smart in coinciding new plots involving Cross with events that occurred during Bourne's time on the screen.

Renner does a very good job with the lead here, displaying the physical and mental extremes we've come to expect from a Bourne film. The supporting cast is also very good; Rachel Weisz portrays a frightened yet brilliant geneticist and Edward Norton is great as the government official that's trying to put an end to the program Cross belongs to. As I said, the story is very smart and I was surprised how well it fit into the events and ideas I had seen in the Bourne trilogy. There's some great action scenes and I'm hoping we get to see a continuation of Cross' story.",1356480000,,1082,4.664921465968586

5156549,5,B008EHZWOU,"You should expect an entertaining movie with Edward Norton and Jeremy Renner in it.  Both are good actors and carry their scenes.  Both quickly establish their characters and make them believable.  The movie takes off at a rapidly fast pace.  You must pay attention or you might lose some of the plot.  While it takes a wide divergence from the Matt Damon Bourne movies, it delivers a credible sequel that actually convinces you that Jason Bourne is wreaking havoc with the CIA while Aaron Cross is finding a way to save his life.  The action scenes are fast paced and numerous.  While Jason Bourne still seems more deadly to me, Aaron Cross can kill you silently and swiftly.  I would recommend this movie to all Jason Bourne fans.  If you like Jason Bourne, you will like Aaron Cross.",1356307200,,786,4.63768115942029

But since I rented it through Amazon and this movie in HD was conspicuously devoid of surround sound, as an HD movie should be, Amazon gets a MAJOR FAIL for the delivery of this movie, especially at $5.99 and in this day an age - there's absolutely no excuse why an HD movie should be delivered in stereo only.

5156569,5,B008EHZWOU,"I rented this first because of the mixed reviews, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a fan of the original series with Matt Damon, but I encourage first-time viewers not to begin by comparing this one to those, because there are some differences. First, I thought Jeremy Renner did an excellent job. He's a much different actor than Damon, so he brought something new to the Bourne series. The on-screen pair up with Rachel Weisz was genius--I thought they played excellently off each other and their chemistry was just right. I suppose I didn't dissect the script too much because I was looking for a great action movie and that's what I got, but I didn't feel the writing was bad either. The scenery in the beginning of the movie was breathtaking, which is always a bonus for me. Those looking for another Bourne movie like the originals may be disappointed (though I honestly don't know why they would be), but those looking for a fun, non-stop action movie with some drama, and great acting by some great stars, would likely enjoy this movie. It's also clean (discounting the violence). I'll definitely watch and buy any other movies Renner does for this series--they just need to recast Weisz with him!",1356220800,,1228,4.689814814814815
5156570,5,B008EHZWOU,this movie surpassed my expectations. The action scenes are as good as the prior Bourne movies plus we get to see some amazing free-running in this movie.

It amounts to little more than a (very badass) junkie, looking for a fix. Essentially two hours of ""where can I find these drugs?"" I can see how this was more of a bridge film so that it could break away from Jason Bourne's story, but they did a shoddy job of it, as they broadly reference Jason Bourne in snippets for no real reason.

I thought it was a big improvement over other Bourne movies, because it seemed more believable, although the wolf fight scene was a bit extreme, I still loved it. Also things in the movie seemed to flow better from one scene to the next. It was entertaining and kept my interest through the entire movie. I liked the chemistry between the characters and the sets in the Phillipines were great, especially the motorcycle chase scene.

5156595,4,B008EHZWOU,Overall I would give this movie two thumbs up. My only issue is the story is a bit slow and disjointed for the first maybe 30 minutes. The action scenes are great with some great back drops. I personally see this movie as a build up to continue the series using the Aaron Cross character giving him a foot hold into the series and introduction. With the ending so wide open a follow up is in the works.,1356134400,,402,4.166666666666667

I am a huge Bourne fan, but somehow the story pulled me in and kept me there.

Sometimes, too much whirling leads to hurling, as in this case.  It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good.  The motive of the bad guys (my favorite bad guys, the guvnment) was muddy, the process ill-defined and the ending just tacked on without any closure (and without leaving us open for another movie to straighten the whole mess out).

5156610,3,B008EHZWOU,"First, let me say, I am a huge fan of the Bourne franchise and own all three of the preceding movies. That said, this movie was, overall, a real disappointment.

Others have explained the plot, and the way they have tied it to the previous movies, but that seems to be all this movie aspires to do. It's like the movie studio sat around and said, ""Okay, how can we make some more money off the `Bourne` thing?"" By the end of the movie, I could only feel a bit cheated, as if the executives grabbed the first half of one of Robert Ludlum's books and made a movie from it -- giving us plenty of character development and backstory with absolutely no conclusion.

I can only conclude that this entire movie was simply dedicated to introducing Cross as the new main character for future movies. Unfortunately, I don't share the leading lady's final sentiment of hoping they were lost, but hoped the producers would have found a way to make this movie go somewhere.

This movie, overall, had fantastic action as always, and an underwhelming story.",1356134400,,1042,4.561497326203209

This film does away with the disorienting use of the shaky cam.  It's there but not in a really noticeable way.  The best thing the film had going for it were the action scenes.

The story is a bit derivative (like an onion, peeling away the layer of one training program reveals another underneath, one with supposedly better and more ""stable"" agents.  How many layers will there be in the end, I wonder?) but it detracts only slightly from the action.  Jeremy Renner is in his element as an action hero, and Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the brainy, brave and vulnerable leading lady, as usual.  A complaint I might have had if I didn't know there will be a sequel is that I thought the story ended with too many loose ends.  Another complaint is that we didn't get to see the trademark hand-to-hand combat at the end with the other ""super"" agent.

5156663,4,B008EHZWOU,"Going into this movie I had thought that the main character was still Bourne himself (I had never read the books), and was a little disappointed that Matt Damon was being replaced...although I very much like Jeremy Renner and if I could have chosen one actor to replace Bourne it would have been him, so I held out some hope for the movie.  However, upon viewing the movie I realized that Renner was playing a completely different character and that the story just contained a matter that Bourne had been involved in, so it was one of the scenarios like ""Oh, ok...I seen now.""

Overall I found myself enjoying the movie, as did my dad, who I'd gone to see this with.  He and I both really enjoy the spy action type movies like these and the Bond movies & such and often go and see those types of movies together.  I felt the story was compelling and engaging, and I felt the overall acting within this film was top notch, especially on the part of Renner and Weisz.  If you really want a more in depth, detailed review of what I thought of the movie, read the 4 star rating at the top of the reviews by D.T. Jewett entitled A Movie In Search of a Director...I don't think I could have written a better review myself on this movie, and his opinion is basically about the same as I felt about the movie, give or take maybe one or two minor little things but it's overall about the same that I felt.

To boil it all down, if you love spy thriller/action movies I recommend this!  If perhaps you have seen the past Bourne movies and are perhaps maybe just skeptical about this, especially considering it stars a different actor, don't be!  Renner did not replace Damon as Bourne...he's a completely different agent.  I went and picked this up day one when it released on Blu-Ray...it's great!",1355961600,,1788,4.410334346504559

Like a microscope user, the movie viewer sometimes sees a world invisible to the naked eye---this world is ugly. Programmed killers. Crazed ""lone gunman"" mass murderers. Implanted chips. Dying microbiologists. CIA black op funding. Drones over America.

Bourne seems to be a ""Mr. Smith"" for the 21st century, except if  he were to ""go to Washington"" he would be assassinated by the ""government"" forces. Like the ""Lone Gunman"" TV series fictional representation of a CIA robotic airliner attack on the World Trade Center (aired months before 911), this movie gives the world a peek inside the petri dish of 21st century NWO America.

5156714,3,B008EHZWOU,"This is likely the last Bourne movie that will be worthy of a theater screening, and I have to think it only made the cut based on the series' reputation, and the start (namely Edward Norton) in this one.

The plot was far too out-sized for the movie, which didn't have the time to invest in all of the tangents that it mentioned.  At it's core, this movie is true to the series, though.  In fact, he first 30 minutes are very well done, and add value to the series.  As it progresses, more and more characters are introduced, or re-introduced from previous movies in the series.  Ignore most of these asides, and the plot flows more smoothly.

If you're an action fanatic, then yes, there is an overdone chase scene with multiple vehicles, winding streets, and even a ""bad-guy"" character introduced just for the scene to give the protagonist real competition.  In contrast to the opening of the movie, the finale is a clich and formulaic gimmick.

5156723,2,B008EHZWOU,"Don't be fooled, just cause it has Bourne in the title doesn't mean it's a true Bourne movie. I loved the first 3 movies, great intriguing deep story with intense awesome action scenes, but this just doesn't carry over ANY of that into this one. At first I found myself feeling that this movie felt empty without Matt Damon, but as the movie progressed I'm glad he wasn't in this one as it was a poor movie overall and Bourne character, I'm glad he didn't tarnish the true Bourne movies by being in this one.

The story, boring, not nearly as deep or intriguing, and actually quite action movie cliche, he has no medicine (lame story plot to begin w/) but the bad guys are after him so he has to beat them to it, even more lame. Action, barely any, without the fight scenes you never truly learn how dangerous of an agent he really is, and this just adds to me caring less about the story and character. I mean, Jeremy Renner is awesome action guy, but whoever created/wrote ""Bourne"" for this  movie is an idiot, in the first 3 movies you could tell how smart and dangerous he Really was, by how he absolutely tears through guys, speaking pretty much every language, and having great survival skills, you barely get ANY of that in this movie, there's barely a survival bit in the beginning, there's next to no action, and I don't think he even speaks another language other than English nor do we see any of his survival skills, this movie completely fails to give you any sense of who he was in the first 3 movies.

It's an odd movie if you've watched the earlier 3 many times, there are a couple of the same faces, but the new faces like Edward Norton I could just not take seriously. The head of CIA is supposed to be this corrupt jerk, but again the movie in whole kinda fails to get this across, it's like I was supposed to care about him, but I didn't.

Going on from that, it references the first 3 movies and it's plot, characters, and history, to give a back story, but all it does is serve as an ugly reminder of how good that story was and how much worse this one is.

The ending, again, lame, usual Bourne car chase that barely resembles the ones in the first 3, they send this agent that comes out of no where who supposedly is stronger *spoiler* but doesn't beat him *end spoiler*, it's like if they didn't put in the required agent that the corrupt CIA people send after him to kill him, I wouldn't think this is a Bourne movie, this can also be said for how they keep talking about Treadstone and Blackbriar like it means something to the story, it's like they just put it in to make it look and sound like a Bourne movie but never really pull it off.

If you are Bourne fan, watch it I guess, it's an ok somewhat entertaining watch, but if you're watching for a good Bourne movie, SKIP. I realized after writing this review how much this movie sucked and is truly a poor representation of the first 3. It saddens me more though seeing Bourne fanboys supporting this garbage.",1355875200,,2991,4.322638146167558

Really? with evil terrorists and out of control communist and rogue states out there all we can get is bad americans?  Fighting the cia? Actually there may  have been no real cia on cia battles ever in history. Or days of the condor. Or whatever. BUt hollywood can't get away from this type of thing. There is a new movie based on real cia people called 'zero dark thirty' coming out at the theaters soon. NOone in the cia tries to kill each other though. how wierd is that? Please avoid this movie so that they will stop making movies where a betrayed agent fights the cia. It's really old and a waste of time. Although the first 2 borne movies were great.

The movie proved difficult to follow at times, and was extremely fragmented with regard to the storyline. It was action packed, but sometimes became very predictable and it didn't begin tying in much of the prior movies until closer to the end.

It offers a good cast, good acting, good cinematography, and good action sequences. But therein lies the problem: it's just good, not great like the Matt Damon series. At no point in the film did I feel that I really cared what happened to Renner's character. Hey, I'm not a movie aficionado; I'm just a guy who really liked the three previous Bourne films and was disappointed that Damon declined to go on with it. I was curious what the new adaptation would offer, and having now seen it, largely unmoved. Perhaps if the connections go forward with another entry, they'll figure out what this effort lacked and make the necessary adjustments.

It's like watching a TV show and plot starts to unfold and then all of sudden it ends with saying ""tune in next week for the dramatic conclusion!""  The movie felt unfinished and the movie as a whole was not strong to begin with to have an ending like this movie had.

The ""Bourne Identity"" introduced and developed characters, but movie ended very well, you knew there was going to be sequel, but at the same time you felt good about the conclusion of the first movie.

Overall this movie is 2 star and worth rental, but definitely not worth buying on DVD or Blu-ray.",1355875200,,745,4.537313432835821

But as a full-grown adult, I found the complete lack of a story line completely unentertaining.

Jeremy Renner does not replace Matt Damon but he wasn't meant to as his character is that of another agent serving during the same timeline as Jason Bourne.  Renner's character does not have the same range of emotional vulnerability nor the feeling of mental toughness as the Jason Bourne charactor but that is okay as the movie makes it clear that the two characters are not competing in any way.
Rachel Weiss' character does an excellent job in this movie, even better in my opinion than the female actors in the Matt Damon movies, and that adds needed dimension in this movie.

The story, as is true with all of Robert Ludlum's created ""Jason Bourne"" character writing skills, taken up by Tony Gilroy is consistent with what we have come to expect in this series - and, the viewer is not disappointed.  Action a-plenty - and ""I-can-believe-it"" choreography; Acting abilities of all the major (and a couple of minor) ""stars"" is commendable.  AND the reality of the two major characters inter-actions are consistent (in my estimation anyway) of what intimacies would most likely transpire between two persons in like (or similar) circumstances as those depicted in the story/film.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film, which will no doubt be the catalyst for a long line of sequels - and, if those future productions are as good as this one is ...

5156786,1,B008EHZWOU,The quality was great. The action was great. However movies have to be more than that now especially if your going to continue a saga like this one. I was super excited to see this and then I ended up falling asleep in the middle of it because there was no suspence. The marketing was awesome on this one however because they managed to get me to watch it just because of the previous movies.

I was expecting them to take better care with the franchise then to have a really loose tie-in with another agent who was on the hunt for some pills(?) Yes. That was literally the plot. Finding pills. There was no main action set piece and it was just muddled throughout. I thought Skyfall was better than this and that was -eh- as well.",1355875200,,471,4.488372093023256

I do not plan on purchasing any Sony Blu-ray's in the future!  I bought the movie and I should be able to watch it where ever I want.  I wasn't aware that Blu-rays can be copied on a PC yet?

5156816,3,B008EHZWOU,"If I were in the business of making movies, I would probably keep the wolf vs. airplane duos on the cutting room floor. In the opening scene of this movie Renner's character had just scaled a precipitous mountain range on foot, in a blizzard, while being chased by wild animals. Did I then need to see him laboriously stuff a tracking device down a rabid wolf's throat in order to evade a drone bomber to fully grasp his badassness?

The Ludlum series (first three Bourne books/movies) were highly character based - plenty of internal contemplation and strife to set the pace of drama. Action in his books was relatively minimal and never gimmicky, and the first three Bourne movies captured this character-driven battle well.

Jeremy Renner was great, as he tends to be, but several silly stunts were not only implausible, but unnecessary for telling a story about a government conspiracy gone wrong. Inserting a nail into a fire extinguisher hose to craft a mid-battle MacGyver gun? His bare hands are lethal weapons!

Not a bad movie, but that's about the nicest thing I can say.",1355875200,,1082,4.806451612903226
5156817,2,B008EHZWOU,"I understand the negative reviews on this movie now that I have watched it. This movie felt like it was pieced together to capitalize off of the successful Bourne franchise. The story felt rushed and the ending was terrible. Right in the middle of an action sequence that seemed to be leading somewhere, it cuts to the star and the girl on a boat out in the middle of the ocean. And then rolls to the credits.

Otherwise, this was a decent Bourne flick, I do recommend watching at least the previous film first, as there is a lot of references and time-line cross-over to the last film.

5156851,4,B008EHZWOU,"For over a decade, action/thriller spy fans have been entertained by Robert Ludlum's ""Bourne"" series.

Featuring a film adaptation of the trilogy (""The Bourne Identity"", 2002; ""The Bourne Supremacy"", 2004; and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", 2007) by Tony Gilroy (who co-wrote each film), it was thought by many that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" would be the final film in the series.

Of course, the Bourne films were a tremendous success but by 2008, a fourth film was being planned.  But with Paul Greengrass (who directed the second and third ""Bourne"" film)  not returning as a director, actor Matt Damon said he would not do another Bourne film.

But Tony Gilroy along with his brother Dan Gilroy would begin working on writing a fourth film that didn't include Jason Bourne titled ""The Bourne Legacy"".  Not wanting to re-create a Bond series with a different actor, he would only work ona fourth film if none of the original cast or filmmakers were involved.  And with the events of ""Bourne Ultimatum"", it would lead to ""Bourne Legacy"" post-Bourne.

The film which was budgeted around $125 million would go on to earn over $276 million in the box office and now will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in Dec. 2012 courtesy of Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""The Bourne Legacy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and while watching this film, I was pleased with the clarity and detail.  Wonderful contrast and I detected no aliasing, no banding or artifacts.  No problems with the picture quality whatsoever.  Videophiles will be pleased with the overall picture quality especially the cinematography courtesy of Robert Elswit (Magnolia"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""Syriana"" and ""There Will Be Blood"").

Thanks to the many gorgeous location shots and great coverage of the action sequences, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a film that looks amazing on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

From Aaron in the the frozen area of Alaska, the sounds of a missile being shot and a cabin being blown up, wolves growling from the distance, gun shots being pumped, a motorcycle chase-scene, a laboratory being riddled with gun shots and the ambiance of crowd scenes galore, ""The Bourne Legacy"" sounds amazing on Blu-ray, great use of surrounds for panning and directional audio and also LFE for explosions.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Espanol and Francais.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that prior to the theatrical release of ""The Bourne Legacy"", I was skeptical of a film based on the Bourne Series but yet doesn't feature Jason Bourne as the primary character.  I asked myself of how would Tony and Dan Gilroy create a story without its lead character, which many of us have enjoyed!  And one can only wonder if Tony Gilroy was going to follow a similar 007 style of storyline with its treatment of the character but with a different actor.

Thankfully this was not the case with ""The Bourne Legacy"" as the Gilroy brothers really planned this film out with future potential in mind.  Consider it a storyline within the world of the Bourne series, it's storyline of hidden government black ops groups, testing of soldiers using chemical pills but then the secret side of government who wants to hide any lead to this secret black ops groups by trying to eliminate those who were involved.

Enter Aaron Cross, a member of the black ops group, Operation Outcome, one of the many operatives that is to be killed, so no traces of Operation Outcome can be discovered during the investigations of Operations Treadstone and Blackbriar.

But due to his enhanced thinking and ability due to the pills he had been taking as part of Operation Outcome, he manages to thwart his death, but letting the retired Col. Eric Byer, USAF and his staff think that he's dead.

For those who thought about comparing actor Jeremy Renner to Matt Damon in this action-role, the first half hour literally makes you forget Damon as Renner is able to show that he can do action scenes.  And it helps that his popularity as Hawkeye in the summer blockbuster ""The Avengers"" showed that he's more than capable of taking on the role as the primary operative and protagonist.

With two talented actors with Renner and Edward Norton as the antagonist, the film is strengthened by its female lead, Rachel Weisz.  Playing a geneticist, Dr. Marta Shearing, fortunately this is not your banal sexpot, short-fling character.  She's a smart intelligent woman that has been pulled into danger as she is also targeted for death and now the character along with Aaron Cross are doing all they can to survive and run.

The film not only features very good acting but also exciting action sequences.  And the cinematography to cover the fast action was exciting to see.  Robert Elswit may be known for films such a ""Magnolia"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""Syriana"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" but when it comes to action films such as ""Mission Impossible: The Ghost Protocol"" and ""Salt"", he is a cinematographer with a great eye when it comes to action films.  And so far this is one of his best best films yet.  Thanks to the many gorgeous location shots, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a film that does look quite amazing!

But what about the film's faults?  The primary fault that I found with ""The Bourne Legacy"" is not setting up of what happened in the previous three films.  For those who haven't watched the trilogy, and those who have and have not seen it in several years, will probably not remember Pam Landy's character and what took place between Jason Bourne and the CIA Deputy Director and what the CIA was secretly doing.  I suspect many viewers will be lost of what is going on and just setting up of what took place in three films, and getting people up to speed.

Also, what made the Bourne films so exciting is its plot.  While ""The Bourne Legacy"" is well-acted, I felt there was too much action over substance, too much of the cat and mouse game than delving deeply into the characters which was done in the previous three films.

Still a film that will have tremendous potential but I rather see more of the deep intelligent plot co-existing with the action, than the film being all about the action.

As for the Blu-ray release, videophiles and audiophiles will absolutely enjoy the presentation of ""The Bourne Legacy"" on Blu-ray. The video is well-detailed, amazing clarity and picture quality features no blemishes or anything problematic.  The lossless audio because of the intense action is immersive and impressive!  And there are a good number of special features included as well.  Also, the additional extra of having a DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet version is a plus.

Overall, ""The Bourne Legacy"" shows promise of being something greater for future sequels.  The first film featured good acting, clever and intelligent writing and amazing action sequences and cinematography (and also music).  But its action sequences eclipses its plot quite a bit.  Still, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is an awesome Blu-ray release and fans of the Bourne series will surely enjoy this film in HD.  Recommended!",1355788800,,8803,4.973305954825462

5156853,4,B008EHZWOU,This Movie is Good but not Great. It has great scenery and special affects but this is not a Jason Bourne Sequel and to their credit it is not advertised that way if you pay attention.,1355788800,,184,4.138888888888889
5156854,5,B008EHZWOU,"The movie is slow to get into with a lot of info being thrown at the audience who have not seen previous movies, and the ending is abrupt (leaving it open for the next chapter), but overall, I find this my favorite out of the four.  I like the relationship with Aaron and Marta much better than Jason and Marie.  And after three movies of a man not knowing who he is, it was nice to see one who volunteered, and to know why he did so and why the program is so important to him.  Renner, Weisz, Norton and the rest of the cast are excellent in their parts.  I am looking forward to a future movie now that the universe has expanded and it's not all about Treadstone.  The movie deserves a shot, and it better on the second viewing, as many are, since you know more about what's going on.  I recommend giving it a try.",1355788800,,816,4.10062893081761

I feel that it would have been better if Matt Daman was in this one.  After all, I think he was the one who made the movie.  All in all, this sequel was good.",1355788800,,302,3.746031746031746
5156857,2,B008EHZWOU,"While the Bourne Legacy has all of the elements of a good movie, it lacks much of the charm of the earlier Bourne movies.  The actors do a good job, but the movie moves along unevenly, with meager action scenes interspersed among people telling us that stuff is happening.  Many scenes contribute little to the overall movie to the point that once the protagonists board the airplane, some unnecessary 'tension building' scenes just pissed me off -- oh no!  He couldn't find her on the airplane!  He looks there!  And there!  Oh, wait, there she is.  WHY IS THAT SCENE THERE.  The climactic fight scene ends with a whimper and an unrealistic burst of CGI, as does the movie itself, which left the both of us wondering, ""That's it?""

Basically the movie watches like the director/writer couldn't let go of any of the scenes he wrote.  This film could have been much improved.",1355788800,,874,4.65359477124183
5156858,2,B008EHZWOU,"I rented this film expecting an action flick and what I got instead was a scientific thriller that just didn't make any sense to me.  There was quite a bit of talking while Renner's character, Aaron Cross pops these pills in between brief action scenes.  I'm a pharmacist and couldn't really understand what Renner was taking these pills for?  I assume it had to do with a virus, but this in itself didn't make much sense.  Also, how Rachel Weisz's character plays a role in this plot too confused me.  Overall, I would pass on this one.",1355702400,,537,4.494845360824742

I loved this Bourne movie, I think its my favorite one next to the 3rd one. Very fast paced, action packed and I love the new actor, he plays a great role.

5156864,4,B008EHZWOU,"I really wanted to see this movie mainly because it follows the Bourne Trilogy and promised to be just as fast paced. I gave it four stars mainly because it was slow starting and the editing was a little choppy. However if you sit down and really pay attention you will understand why the first 30 minutes were kinds of slow. Once the action started, it was never ending. My husband is very hard to please and if a movie can't get his attention in the first 15 minutes, he gets up and will refuse to watch it. That didn't happen this time and he sat through it. Jeremy Renner is great as Aaron Cross and really has no clue as to why he suddenly becomes the hunted until he searches for the Virologist that was also involved in turning him into another Jason Bourne. Rachel Wiez is also great as the doctor that foolishly believes the government cares about her after she is the lone survivor of a massacre. Needless to say, she is still as feisty as when she starred along side Brandon Frasier and shows how great an actress she is in action movies. She is easily a match for Jeremy Renner in the action sequences in the movie and Edward Norton is great as the man in charge of ""cleaning things up"" and will undoubtedly be back in the 2nd installment. There are many unanswered questions but as with the Bourne Trilogy, that too will be taken care of as story continues.",1355616000,,1370,4.35546875

I wasn't.",1355616000,,314,4.25
5156868,4,B008EHZWOU,It's was a good movie however it was not as good as the first three movies which starred Matt Damon.  Jeremy Renner did a pretty good job as the main character and the movie was interesting.  This movie had good action scenes and the ending leaves the movie open to continue the series.  I would love to see the next movie costar Damon and Renner.  4 out of 5 stars for me.,1355616000,3,373,4.138888888888889
5156869,2,B008EHZWOU,"This movie was mildly entertaining but only toward the end with the motorcycle sequences. The plot--such as it was--was disjointed and hardly made sense.

5156872,3,B008EHZWOU,"I am a long time fan of the Bourne franchise, and I absolutely love the first three installments. However, this latest installment doesn't quite hit the mark. Jeremy Renner's performance as an actor was great, he was very believable, as was the rest of the cast. The story wasn't bad-although it came across as slow at times, and the action sequences were enjoyable too. The fact that Jason Bourne wasn't the main character wasn't the issue for me either. The issue for me was that the movie doesn't deliver that punch that the first three Bourne films delivered. You know that feeling that you experience after watching a really good movie, that overwhelming feeling of ""WOW... what a great movie""! I'm speaking of the kind of Bourne film that you would watch a million times over. Unfortunately, this latest Bourne installment doesn't quite excite me. I'm not implying that Legacy isn't worth watching, just don't expect to be wooed by another great Bourne film, because this one leaves the die hard Bourne fans hanging. Merely entertaining is how I would sum The Bourne Legacy. Hopefully, Tony Gilroy will get it right with the fifth installment.",1355616000,4,1149,4.897435897435898
5156873,4,B008EHZWOU,"For those who do not know, and are expecting to see Matt Damon reprise his role as Jason Bourne in this movie, he does not.  He is referred to, and some of the events in the Bourne Ultimatum are tied into this movie, but this is a separate story.  I do think Jeremy Renner and (the ageless) Rachel Weisz perform well in their respective roles.  Weisz does a great job as a doctor who is somewhat naive about the consequences of her work.  Renner also does a good job as Cross and makes him different enough from Bourne that is does not just seem to be a total rehash of what we have already seen.  Edward Norton also does a good job as the government foil who is trying to hunt down Cross.

As my title says, this movie expands the Bourne Universe beyond the operatives we already knew existed.  It certainly sets up the possibility of more movies including the possibility that Bourne and Cross will team up at some point.  You get the requisite balance of action and story as were in the other movies.  Like in the other movies it does slow down in the middle, but I did not find it was dragging too much for me.  You also get the trademark Bourne chase scene near the end of the movie.  This time a motorcycle chase through Manilla.

Ultimately, if you enjoyed the other movies (as long as you are not one of those who cannot see anyone other than Damon in the lead role) you will probably find this one enjoyable as well.  While there are elements from the other movies (and even continues the story line from the Bourne Ultimatum at the end) it does for the most part stand on its own.  Like the other movies, it does take a good amount of suspension of disbelief, because there are certainly absurd moments, but if you can get beyond that I recommend it.",1355616000,7,1760,4.310030395136778

5156875,3,B008EHZWOU,"Let me first say that I think the movie is great.  This review is based on the Blu-Ray implementation.  I have never seen such a poorly thought out/bad customer experience as shown by this Blu-Ray.
I popped it into my PS3 (what I use to watch all my Blu-Rays), and it took well over a minute to load, with a little animated Universal logo. The screen resolution changed on my screen, more animated logo... another resolution change, more animated logo.
Then, I saw ""Loading some fresh movie trailers from the Internet"" message.  Wait, what? It's loading trailers, without my permission from the Internet (in HD no less), when I'm trying to watch a movie.  Fortunately, I was able to press ""next chapter"" to skip past the commercials, one after each other, with three total.
But then, it just sat there.  almost confused.  After 4 minutes, I gave up, and exited the movie, back to the PS3 home screen.

I tried it again, this time it seemed much faster, just a 1 minute delay, 1 minute for the Universal logo splash screen, then straight to ""loading fresh trailers"".  Skipped 3 commercials and it finally loaded the disc menu.

After that, the movie played fine.  But, what an annoying experience!",1355616000,,1196,4.706730769230769

5156882,2,B008EHZWOU,This movie was nothing more than a bad copy of the original series.  The action was dull and the drama and mystery surrounding the main character was absent.  They didn't even try to maintain any level of intrigue; they laid it all out for you each step of the way.  What made the original series so good was the fact that you were following Jason Bourne on an intense journey to find out who he really was.  Nothing about this movie seemed original and it completely lacked any intensity. I was bored by the time the big cookie cutter chase scene occurred.  If the movie were titled anything else I would probably give it 3 stars since it was watchable but it just didn't live up to the legacy of Bourne.,1355529600,,705,4.351145038167939
5156883,4,B008EHZWOU,"Upon seeing the trailer online back in the Summer, when the film was 1st in theaters, I was hyped-up. As a fan of the Bourne Trilogy since the 1st film (The Bourne Identity) in 2002, & as a collector of the films, I knew that I'd purchase it as soon as it was released. There are enough reviews regarding the plot of this film, so I'll leave that out. When the release date was announced on Amazon.com, I Pre-Ordered the DVD (w/out having seen the picture). I was especially excited that Edward Norton was added to the cast as Ret. USAF Col. Eric Byer, who happens to be the film's primary antagonist. Norton rarely portrays villans, so I was looking forward to his performance. 2ndly, I was thrilled that for the sake of continuity, Joan Allen (Pam Landy), David Stratharian (Noah Vosen), Scott Glenn (Ezra Kramer), & Albert Finney (Dr. Albert Hirsch) were cast in this film! Sadly to say, the amount of screen time that these 4 great actors (& characters) recieve amounts barley to cameo appearances. Heck, Finney's main scene was deleted & can only be viewed on the Deleted Scenes Special Feature! As for Jeremy Renner, his role as Aaron Cross is quite good, given the script that Renner was given. All-in-all, I was a little let-down by the film as a whole. It didn't have the Bourne film ""feel"" that the 1st 3 had, & felt more like a stand-alone picture. Although Director Tony Gilroy tried to attach a sense of continuity by bringing back actors/characters from the original trilogy, they didn't have nearly enough screen time to make it stick! In my opinion, the film's saving grace-Edward Norton! As 'Ric Byer, he's as ruthless, cold-blooded, & mechanical as ever & you can see that Norton loved playing the part. Any film buff should know that Norton is an extremley versatile actor. It is really cool to see him play the main antagonist-a role that he really hasn't done before (unless you count ""Primal Fear"", ""American HistoryX"", or ""The Score""--but those were different types of antagonistic roles than this 1).

Starts off with the character going from one place to another in Alaska seemingly on a training exercise. The journy is less believable as he progresses. Of course there is some incident that turns him against his organization and the stroy trots along with him trying to stay alive while getting to the next phase in the story, which is in the Philippines. After a few close calls everything works out just fine, as predicted.

They mention Jason Borne a few times in the movie and bring back Pam Landy just to make the connection to the original series.

Don't expect Jeremy Renner to replace Matt Damon, as this is not the intent. Renner is quite a good actor in his own right, and has risen in the ranks of action stars recently, most notably as 'Hawkeye' in the Avengers. The Bourne Legacy starts slow, but picks up tempo quite quickly as it intertwines with the plot of the Bourne Ultimatum. There is a great supporting cast including Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz. The car chase is replaced by motorcycles, but in all a great follow up to the previous three movies. If you liked them, this will not disappoint.",1355529600,170,709,4.503875968992248

Movie started off like a Senior citizen running a 100 yard dash. I was hoping this would be great like the ones with Damon. It seems like every time the main character in a great series is replaced the quality of the movie suffers(the last Spider-Man movie is an example) the acting was good but the director may need to think about a career change. Some may like it some may not. But like I said before RENT it first.,1355443200,,538,4.284313725490196

The premise of this movie is the fall out.  It tracks what normally happens when top secret programs suddenly become public in the movies.  The Agencies seek to protect what they can, and burn the rest.  So This follows that premise.  If you are looking for the more detailed plots that the previous movies had, it's not in this movie.

This movie is the establishment of the new character ""Aaron Cross"", and following his journey through the burn.  Being that they plan on continuing the story line, you know the new character is going to survive.

If you enjoy Jeremy Renner, you will most likely like this movie.  If you really liked the previous movies, you will either love or hate this movie, but only you can make that choice.",1355443200,2,822,4.530612244897959

There is far too much time spent between the two main characters arguing where I found myself thinking I wish they would just do something.  Add that to the end chase scene which seems to go on for ever and is just too unbelievable.  The guy chasing them seems like a T-1000 terminator that can't get hurt and no matter how many times it seems that he would have lost them picks up their trail instantly like in any Tommy Lee Jones movie where he is tracking someone.

Also you need to see all three of the previous Bourne movies to have any idea what is going on. The Bourne Legacy cannot stand on it's own.

5156920,3,B008EHZWOU,"Switching stars in a profitable movie sequel is risky business.  It can make for disaster (""Grease 2"") or yield surprisingly good results (""Batman Begins"").  That's the challenge faced by ""The Bourne Legacy,"" the fourth in the Bourne series and the first starring Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"").

The previous Bourne movie, ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" released in 2007, starred Matt Damon, who created the role on screen.  When Damon and director Paul Greengrass decided to take some time off from the series, Universal faced the same problem Columbia did with Spider-Man:  how do you keep a lucrative franchise alive without the star and the director who made it a success?  A lot was at stake; the first three Bourne pictures had earned nearly a billion dollars worldwide.

Rather than have a new actor assume the role, the production created an entirely new covert government-trained assassin:  Aaron Cross.  Several actors were considered, among them Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire, Garrett Hedlund, Michael Fassbender, Alex Pettyfer, Kellen Lutz, Josh Hartnett, Paul Dano, and Michael Pitt.  After a long series of auditions, Renner won the role.

""The Bourne Legacy"" isn't, therefore, technically a sequel.  Call it a spinoff, with a new protagonist and new-to-the-franchise director Tony Gilroy expanding the saga created by Robert Ludlum.  Cross faces life-or-death stakes triggered by events of the first three films.  Also new to the series are Edward Norton, Rachel Weisz, Stacy Keach, and Oscar Isaac.  Franchise veterans Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Scott Glenn reprise their roles from the earlier films.

Special features on the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include seven behind-the-scenes featurettes, feature commentary with the creative team, digital copy, and deleted scenes.",1355270400,,1816,5.501805054151625

5156925,5,B008EHZWOU,"It is understandable that there is a difference of opinion about THE BOURNE LEGACY, but comparing it to the original three Jason Bourne movies is unfair.  This is a `legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such, for this reviewer, it works very well.  The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography, has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.

As someone distilled the plot, `this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of ""Operation Blackbriar"" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. ""Outcome"", the program in question is an offshoot of both ""Treadstone"" and ""Blackbriar"" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.' 

Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting.  Jeremy Renner is excellent, always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations.  The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney, Oscar Isaac, David Strathairn, and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.

The speed of the action, the poundingly purposeful musical score and the non-stop fascinating twists and turns make this a top-notch film.  It does carry on the `legacy' of Ludlum's ideas, but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. Grady Harp, December 12",1355270400,7,2066,4.88

5156927,2,B008EHZWOU,"I'll have to watch this a few more times, to get the connection between clips of earlier Bourne movies and this one.  I don't get the connection.  Bourne's floating in the sea and all of a sudden in Bourne's Legacy, a guy is swimming with the salmon and fighting wolves. Climbing mountains and jumping stone to stone, looked particularly un-agile.  Running across a mountain top, jumping stone to stone, even Jason Bourne would look imcompetant.  Later as the story progresses, I became interested, and was cheering for the main charachter, what was his name?  Damsels in distress, Washington on edge having screwed up again, win at all cost for their own personnal gain.  Guy showing up at the right time, what was his name?  You had my attention again.  Then, turns out with this adaption, he's a drug addict.  Don't remember that being a Ludlum theme. Ludlum has got to be rolling over.  Beginning weak, story good, ending stupid.  Not at all up to a Ludlum story or movie.

I doubt, I will look forward or buy future Bourne wanta be's.  I'm truly disappointed.
I don't need to tell you that the reason for the interest on my part, was the Bourne novels, which I read years prior to the movies.  Your movie is a clear effort to commercialize and try to milk the imagination and story as told by Ludlum.

You have failed.  Your ending was clearly an opening to ""AN INHERITED LEGACY"".  Where as Ludlum, ended each with an apparent ending, and started each with a surprise, Still Alive, with a new beginning, and with some margin of continuity, with a charachter of exceptional dexterity, physical strength and training, you have brought a drug addict.  Bad choice, stupid choice. Your Bourne, isn't a Bourne at all and is just a prelude to what you think is a trilogy or more.  It's not happening your first legacy is lame. You ain't even in the ballpark. I'm sure next he'll end up in Boston, Philadelphia, Memphis, Dallas, Los Angelas, San Francisco or Fargo. Riding a bicycle.

I'm a Renner fan, so he could read the phone book for 2 hours and I would still be thrilled. I read an article where Damon poo-pooed the movie because of the focus on drugs and where could they possibly take the franchise after this? Any-bleeping-where they choose because they're not hamstrung by a whiny operative lamenting over his identity and once found, then what? Whining about how they keep coming after him?

First I think it was in poor form to use and tease the Jason Bourne character to sell and produce the movie without ever actually materializing the character.  In the movie Bourne was reportedly in NYC but there is not even so much as a cameo appearance, save Jason Bourne's picture on some paperwork and identification.  Second I was a little disappointed in some of the ""low budget"" special effects.  Some of the scenes were clearly animated cartoonish, such as the fight with the wolf in the woods.  The third and final gripe is that the film lacked the ""action and amazement"" rhythm we have come to expect from a Jason Bourne movie.  Shooting down a Predator with a rifle was an awesome start, but lengthy and mindless motorcycle chasing and difficulty taking out a few Asian rent-a-cops was just disappointing.

Some parts of the story were disappointing-Pam Landee getting arrested, but no followup on what happens to her. Ed Norton , as always, is excellent.

5156949,1,B008EHZWOU,"I never became a Matt Damon fan until I saw the Bourne Identity. I got the box set and was impressed with how wonderfully and seamlessly they had tied all 3 different stages of his life reawakening and starting to think for himself. Damon made me a believer in his talent, the intensity in his eyes, his actions and split second timing to keep himself alive against all the power his handlers were throwing against him was amazing and of course the writers, directors and camera men were obviously working in harmony on all three movies and they all Jelled together perfectly

Now the Legacy if we are to believe it, the timeline for this story is paralleling  the time that Jason was in New York still looking for answers and trying to come in out of the cold. The script is so convoluted I could barely follow the narrative. Cold Lakes, wolves, another agent killing time in a little shack totally bored with himself and stupid enough to go back into the shack even after hearing an uninvited visitor in the sky fast approaching. And then there is Edward Norton who talks about another Black Ops project called Outcome. He is afraid everything is unraveling and that all agents still out there beside Bourne need to be eliminated. And all the originals from the Bourne movies were there, the fat old white guys talking about things that I didn't understand because unlike the Bourne movies, this project Outcome was not fleshed out enough to comprehend what they were talking about at any one moment aside from the usual double-cross. These were they guys who were worrying about Bourne but if you hadn't seen the Original Bourne they really don't seem to be acting in this movie as though there was any connection.

I have seen Jeremy Renner in other films and thought he was a good actor who need to find his niche in the movie Industry. There are few actors like Gary Oldman, who can change spots at a moments notice and thats why he gets so many varied and unusual roles and does them well, sometime even without makeup you never realize its him,so well does he become his character. Remmer is not on that level. Mission Impossible, Avengers. 28 weeks later. IMHO he has talent but not fore every role and this was one of them. He was a bore, he really seemed clueless as too what was goig on. ""I fell off the Grid"" yea? and? that means what to you and the consequences. Damon seems a natural when it comes to self defense with quick lightening moves to save his skin. Renner is more the pummel punch and run, not what you expect from someone in this program, but then again he did say his I.Q. was lower then the standard requisite but they let him in anyways. Were they hard up? Dont know, I guess we don't need to know why someone who didn't measure up mentally was allowed to join a super soldier program.

And what was the geek gon postal about? Psychotic break was the cover story but again we are left to guess and why wast brain power on a totally useless scene.

Rachel Weisz, I don't care how you slice it, is not an actress of any caliber. From the first time I saw her in the mummy movies I thought she was great as a ditz, then she was  playing opposite grand actors like Gene Hackman and Bruce Davison in Runaway Jury, she was the same. She is going to be forever playing mediocre characters like a nurse in  Bourne Legacy, she is wooden and very unappealing all around and does not do movies any favors when she is in them.

Edward Norton sounded like a cross between his American History X character and Italian Job double-crosser. He is and can be even more of an excellent performer, witness ""The illusionist"" brilliant. Here I don't know what his job was because he wasn't part of the original canon. A cut scene with him telling Aaron Cross the job they do and innocent people gettig killed. A  morality speech shoved right in the middle. Was this supposed to reveal some pathos about Aaron Cross.? Were we supposed to feel some empathy for him.  He sat there all sad and sweaty as Norton lectured him about the realities of war and the job they do.

This movie should not be considered Canon in my opinion. The chase scene was the lamest I have ever seen, with some number 2  on the list with low empathy who just as bad as Cross, one of their supposed better operatives they copycat the Moroccan chase scene which was well coordinated  and just made it into a stupid chase down Manilla streets, with motorcycle jumps that were so laughable it was sad.

In my final summation I think they screwed up because they didn't really know what to do with Remmer. They focused a lot of chatter on coverups and in the end you have this aborted Legacy. They should have never done this move. They should have waited and cajoled Matt Damon to come back on his terms and make another fabulous Bourne movie. This film should not be the Legacy of what happened to Jason Bourne and all others like him.",1354924800,10,4914,4.451612903225806

The movie isn't supposed to be easy to understand - it's one of those movies that you need to see a few times.

5156953,5,B008EHZWOU,"I give this and all Bourne movies a five star rating. Why? Because of the concept, character, and Genre. These movies have a sense of reality and action that others don't. They have a theme that runs through them all, and that is Government misuse of not only people they don't like but even their own. They use their assets for their agenda and then when that asset becomes to knowledgeable or independent they are expendable. Covert ops and black ops are a Pandora's box for the Government, and no one wants to get caught with their hands in the cookie jar. These movies are all based on the writings of Ludlum who himself had an agenda of exposing what really went on behind the scenes and the dirty little secrets they kept from the public at large. These secrets are not secrets anymore but are becoming all to evident in our lives as we look around and see tell tale signs. My only complaint is that these movies take bits and pieces of Ludlum's novels and create their own story lines and screen plays which bear little resemblance to his brilliant writing or his books. For instance it is never shown in the movies what the origins of the character Jason Bourne really are. Nothing is said of his life with the secret organization called Medusa in the killing fields of Vietnam, how he developed his skills, and how he really acquired the name Jason Bourne. The movies finally show us his real name of David Webb but fail to mention that he assassinated the real Jason Bourne who was in the group Medusa and turned rogue. Nothing is said of the government operation to use David Webb as bait to draw out Carlos the Jackal by using the name Jason Bourne and building a reputation as a rival assassin. These facts are just the tip of the iceberg regarding what's in the real stories or novels upon which these movies are based. His companion Marie is never killed in the novels as she is in the movie but becomes his wife and fellow comrade. But again having said all that, the essence of the novels is somehow captured enough to make these the best spy / covert ops movies around. So far!",1354838400,3,2095,4.458333333333333

5156959,5,B008EHZWOU,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi
I can't imagine how Tony Gilroy, the director of The Bourne Legacy and Jeremy Renner, the actor who would replace Matt Damon as the lead felt.
The previous three Bourne films were top notch. It's a lot to live up to. But the director and actor didn't just match the previous three films, they surpassed them with more action, more thrills and high intensity stunts you'll have trouble wrapping your brain around.
There are various photos and snippets of Borne (Damon) throughout the film but it's clearly Jeremy's reign as he enters as Aaron Cross, a member of a black ops program whose agents are genetically enhanced.
Cross soon comes to realize the U.S. Defense Department is shutting down the program and terminating all agents involved.
The pills he's been taking have run out. He knows his seemingly super powers will soon follow, and he will go through withdrawal. They send a drone to destroy him in a remote cabin in Alaska. He eludes the first drone only to be cutoff by a wolf pack.
He eventually gets back and teams up with the only surviving geneticist Dr. Marta Shearing. He knows she's on the list for elimination too. He must get them out of the country and off the grid fast, but his withdrawal is giving him flu-like symptoms. They wind up in a flophouse, where Cross attempts to recover while consoling Dr. Shearing.
The final motorcycle chase is the finest to ever enhance any screen. Be prepared to be thrilled beyond compare.",1354752000,2,1512,4.752851711026616

I really like how they merged, in part, Ultimatum with this one. Gives you a time line to start with and then takes off from there. Rather well done. Jeremy and Rachel are the perfect people for the parts. The gradual progression of the experiments from pure physc to DNA re-sequencing, is rather frightning, especially when, Lorax, is said to be ""without the side effects"". Ya, like we haven't heard that before. No matter what, this movies grab's you from the first to the last. Don't worry about the popcorn, you'll never have time to enjoy it.

Judging it on its own merits however makes it a damn good action thriller, Jeremy Renner slides into the Agent/Operator role naturally displaying the demeanor of a elite operator as much as the physical know how to back it up.

I adore the first 2 Bourne Movies in this series, the 2nd being my favorite (it had feeling, vision, and purpose) , the third feeling a little too handheld even for me, but it ends very well.. ""Bourne Legacy"" is muddled and so far afield from what was introduced in the original movies that it's indecipherable. Had they not transplanted Jason Bournes picture in this I would have never even guessed this was the same series.. different colored pills/medications/dosages? Where did this come from? The movie moves at a snails pace, and although I've liked Renners' performance in everything up until now, particularly ""The Town"" I have got to steer as many people away from this mess as humanly possible.. not the worst movie ever but one of the worst sequels in recent memory.",1352073600,4,861,4.785234899328859
5156970,3,B008EHZWOU,"The new installment of the ""Bourne"" franchise stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an ""Operation Outcome"" agent, and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing responsible for his medical check-ups. The filmmakers of ""The Bourne Legacy"" should thank their luck that they were able to have these gifted players, for without them, ""The Bourne Legacy"" would have been a total mess.

The storyline of ""Legacy"" itself is not complicated. Now that some of the CIA's top secrets are publicly exposed, Edward Norton's character Eric Byer is hired to erase all the evidences that would lead to further investigation. ""The Bourne legacy"" is not about Jason Bourne, but a chain of events that was triggered by his action seen in ""Ultimatum.""

However, despite several fine action sequences, ""Legacy"" tends to be tedious, taking so much time trying to explain everything. Locations are interesting, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are both impressive, but the film lacks suspense, suffering from the heavy-handed narrative. Also, the character of Aaron Cross is not very interesting, lacking the complexity that Jason Bourne is allowed to have.

To make a new Bourne film means to give a new story and characters to the audiences who have enjoyed the Jason Bourne story arc. Tony Gilroy (screenwriter of the three previous Bourne films) is in charge of this difficult job of expanding the trilogy's universe. To do so, he not only employed ideas like brainwashing and chemicals; the new director called back some of the franchise's supporting players including Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Scott Glenn. Neither of them works. The scientific elements are pretentious and clichd while, as to the presence of these veteran actors, they only help remind us of the merits of ""Ultimatum,"" which knew how to entertain the viewers.

After all, what is the point of making another ""Bourne"" movie when Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is not coming back? In spite of the electrifying acting from Jeremy Renner, ""The Bourne Legacy"" will not answer that question. Perhaps things would have been better with someone as director, who remembers the Bourne trilogy was first and foremost made for entertainment. As it is, ""Legacy"" remains a so-so action movie with A-list actors.",1351900800,3,2239,5.126027397260274
5156971,4,B008EHZWOU,"Now, in 2012, a NEW chapter has arrived to the Bourne franchise: The Bourne Legacy. Directed by Tony Gilroy, the man responsible for writing the previous trilogy, and starring Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, and Joan Allen, The Bourne Legacy is an action-packed, globe-trotting, entertaining, action spy-thriller.

The action scenes are kinetic, explosive, and exciting. They feel less brutal then Matt Damon's fights in The Bourne Ultimatum, but they are in no way less entertaining. In particular, a motorcycle chase in the Philippines will grip you by the tongue and pull you to the edge of your seat, your pulse-pounding. The suspenseful, hand-to-hand fights do NOT disappoint, filmed in shaky-cam, and filled with splintering, brutal blows and chops between 2 or more combatants.
Action: 4.9 Stars! (Juuust short of a perfect score!)

But the real reason why you should watch Legacy is Jeremy Renner. He gives a commanding presence to his character Aaron Cross, and of course, genuine badassery! His character is well-formed, memorable as far as action heroes go, and has a few half-decent one-liners (""Come with me if you want to live"").
Of course, the inevitable comparison with Bourne arises. What do you expect? Nobody could ever beat Jason Bourne, even Aaron Cross. But he's cool, fit, charismatic, can fire a gun, beat up a bad guy, get the girl, and drive fast vehicles. What more could you ask for?
...

The Bourne Legacy is NOT without it's problems, however. I felt that Rachel Weisz's character was handled particularly clumsily, not doing much more than plot dumping and screaming during action scenes.
The peerless Edward Norton (who usually rules every role he plays) is given no room to shine, and plays a cliched, one-dimensional villain. And that leads me to the main problem with the film - the script. Tony Gilroy is under NO circumstances a bad screenwriter or director, but this script is too small in scope to make much of an impact.

The core of the film is Aaron Cross trying to ""viral off"" his chems. That is to say, retain the physical and mental benefits conferred by them, without actually having to consume them. Cross and Shearing spend the main portion of the film evading capture and travelling the globe from the US to Canada to the Phillipines to perform the operation needed for Cross to viral off. After I saw the film I got the feeling that Jason Bourne could have done the same thing in less than half the time. He would have gotten in, gotten on with it, gotten it over with, and gotten out in time for dessert.

So in conclusion, Legacy suffers from some character and script problems.

...

But don't let that deter you in the slightest! I urge you to watch The Bourne Legacy, preferably in HD on a big screen. It's one of 2012's best action-spy thrillers, with great action set pieces, exotic locations, (on the whole) great characters - both reccuring and original, and a stellar turn from Jeremy Renner!

5156972,2,B008EHZWOU,"This movie isn't that good because this movie tries to tie in the last Bourne movie wayyyy to much and then tried to create a new start using Jeremy Renner. That makes this movie a snooze fest and for what seems like the first half of the movie everyone just sits there and talks about what pretty much has happened. Then, they talked about what is happening now and what will happen. There's NO ACTION. You just think about what they are saying and wait to hear the next part of what they will say...that is, if you are still AWAKE!!!

If you really enjoyed the Bourne movies before, you don't want to watch this. It's not as good. Don't waste your money or time as you be asking yourself why did I watch this at the end???

Also, I really hate the ending in this movie. It's so bad and forced to have a good ending. If they want to have a good ending they should do it right and just end it like that. That's so bad that it's shouldn't had happened like that. But, since they pretty much bored us to die in the first half of the movie, they just had to quickly end the movie because obviously running out of movie time and it's sinks already.

---Minor spoilers---

So, the movie can't be saved. At the end, they just like to end it at a happy ending and try to make the viewer dumb down a little by saying forget about what you saw for the movie. Umm NO! Why should one main bad guy dying be a problem for the true people in charge in their offices. They have a ton of people. They tracked down Jeremy Renner's character so far from around the world, they would still be tracking him down after the main bad guy dies. What's one bad guy down going to do to the true people in charge? Nothing. They have a ton of people. They should still be able to send another or even more after Renner's character and continue on with the movie, but no, can't do that. Running out of budget on the movie, no more money, and the movie can't be saved. Got to end it at that. Man, this movie bad. No, movie should just end like that and expect to be good.

5156976,4,B008EHZWOU,"This movie is awesome in some aspects, and there are a few things that I didn't like. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are excellent in this movie - the chemistry between them is awesome! Personally, I think that the relationship between Aaron and Marta is much sweeter than what's between Jason and Marie. The romance (not overly drastic) between Aaron and Marta is tender and inspiring; I like Aaron and Marta's characters better overall than Jason and Marie's too. Jason was really cold in the first Bourne movies, while Aaron is sensitive and caring. And no offense to people who like Marie from the first Bourne movies, but you can't even compare Marie with Marta- Rachel Weisz plays a much better character.
On another note, this movie is a bit hard to follow and is a bit confusing, but if you take it as a side-story to Bourne, and you know the creators (people that are the heads of different government-based programs) of these super-humans are hunting one of their ""creations"" down, and you're there for the ride, it's awesome. (I saw this movie three times in theaters) I'm not much of a fan for the ending of this movie either - I think it is too abrupt like the writers couldn't decide what to do next with the story line.

5156977,4,B008EHZWOU,"This film is in the perfect continuity of the first three in the series by its title which has the same structure as the first three. But I am disappointed in a way.

The action is probably perfect though it is only an escape and not a chase to impose a positive end, only to get away from those who are chasing you. That's weak. For sure we have Manilla and the cars, the motorbikes, the hunt on the roofs and even a long hike in Alaska. I must say that the wolves are superb animals and that it is a shame so many are killed. Though a drone and a missile for one wolf seems slightly expensive.

The plot is simple but unexplained at all. The secret security services of the USA have set up several programs to fight against terrorism, each one of them totally entangled into the others but with one probably slightly more central than the others. A hostile foreign agency that is not identified is trying to get this program and this program has a fair chance to get out because the main people who devised it are not under control. So the decision is taken to destroy the program and to get rid of all those who have been in touch with it, no matter how little.

The worst part is that even the uniformed generals (note the only one that is brought up is black: no allusion to the president that we all know to be powerless) do not know about the situation and it is a handful of bureaucrats of these security agencies that have no public front who take decisions and implement the decisions they take under absolutely no control from whoever you may imagine. The President is not even mentioned. In other words they are, these bureaucrats a state in the sate. The USA have reinvented ,the KGB, the STASI, and those had a public front, even the SS was not completely invisible.

Unluckily this theme has already been explored vastly in the genre over the last fifty years.

It goes slightly further when we learn that this program aimed at producing super human people who did not feel pain, who had an IQ over 200 and who were as strong as aliens. These prototypes were nine and are still six and they have to be eliminated along with all the people who worked on this program. These prototypes were produced by some genetic manipulation of viruses or retroviruses to change the human genome of the individuals who are infected with these genetically modified viruses. But here again that has been used and overused, some could say abused, over the last fifty years in all media imaginable.

To amplify this lack of originality we have to regret the very editing of the film that lines up short sequences that have no relation whatsoever one to the other, no ellipse possible, and that do not make sense for at least a good fourth of the film. This is also quite surprising and disappointing. Jason Bourne had made sure in the previous films that we should know the targets and agents, who is who from the very start and to have a real objective that brought down these security bureaucrats and gave decisional power back to those elected and appointed for that under the strict control of the Senate.

That explains my slight disappointment. Where is the American dream in that fantasy?

The movie has been out for some time now but I still go to see it and half the theater is still filled.  Norton & Keach were great picks for their characters, Norton's acting ability speaks for itself, (American History X and Primal Fear).  Renner is a shy, likeable, naive  person on talk shows but a little bit awkward.  Nevertheless his acting is first rate and the film is very difficult not to like a great deal.

5156981,4,B008EHZWOU,"""The Bourne Legacy"" doesn't really break much new ground in terms of what fans have come to expect from the gritty, violent trilogy of films that preceeded it, but it's still an entertaining diversion. It's a testament to Tony Gilroy's screenwriting savvy, as well as the acting skills of the superb cast, that, although much of the material is familiar and doesn't really deviate from the structure of the preceding films, it's still fun watching a new spy (well-played by Jeremy Renner) kick ass while on the run from a new U.S. government adversary (Edward Norton). Norton especially brings some real strength to the proceedings, and is riveting in all of his scenes. The viewer really buys into his character's well-meaning, but overzealous patriotism. Rachel Weisz is decent as the love interest, although she is basically reduced to acting helpless all the time. Stacey Keach is great as always, but seems sadly underutilized. The action scenes of hand-to-hand combat, car chases and shootouts are well-staged and exciting. Bottom line -- as familiar and perhaps formulaic as all of this is by now, I still want to see more of Renner's Kenneth Gitson.

The movie is action packed with intelligence intertwined, totally enjoyable watching compared to the previous Bourne series. Rachael Weisz is a great addition to the movie too.

If you have seen the trilogy then there are really no spoilers in this film. The movie picks up where the last one left off, meaning this will be difficult to follow if you are not familiar with the trilogy. Treadstone, a secret CIA assassin operation is being shutdown and all loose ends are being eliminated...meaning anyone who can spell ""Treadstone.""

The film concentrates on one operative Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who fakes his death to survive. Now a great flick would have been Jeremy going back and taking out the CIA men who seek to kill him. But they didn't do that...yet. Instead they interject Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing to create a bizarre plot only to end nearly the same as the first Bourne film.

In the next film, Rachel will be killed and Aaron will have to go after the assassin and then apologize to the families of people that he has killed... unless they can convince Matt Damon to come back. Hopefully this is just a tie-in film like ""Star Wars 2"" and not meant to be great.

What we loved about the Bourne series was the ""MacGyver"" aspect of Matt Damon being able to create something out of just about anything due to his elite training. I didn't get enough of that. I didn't ""feel it"" like I did during the original trilogy. There were no great lines like, ""If you were in your office we would be having this conversation face to face."" I was disappointed in this film which can be added to the list of lame blockbusters that has come out this summer, with a few exceptions.

5156989,5,B008EHZWOU,"I was skeptical when I first heard about the Bourne-less Bourne film, but when I went to the theatre and watched this film I was amazed. Jeremy Renner was a surprise as well and a pleasant one. I found myself wishing about half way through that they would stop talking about Bourne and get on with Aaron Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing's story.

Aaron Cross' personality is anything but Bourne-like...He has a sense of humor for one that I enjoyed seeing. He has personality that doesn't involve whinging over his lost past. We get the rounded character from Cross that was missing in Bourne; Cross though lured in at first while at his most vulnerable goes into the program with open eyes and a true desire to serve his country. Over time he becomes disallusioned, but he still serves because that is who he is. However, he begins to see the writing on the wall and question the actions he is ordered to preform. All in all, I want more Aaron Cross and less Bourne in the next film.

Dr. Marta Shearing is an intelligent woman blinded by science and naive enough to let that be her moral compass. She is the picture of many a successful woman who is on-point in the work place, but stumbling around in her private life. She isn't the normal Bourne-Chick being dragged around by the arm at every turn waiting for the hero to save her. She is strong enough to fight to survive at all costs. Rachel Weisz was the perfect choice for this roll and I hope that she continues with this franchise.

There was an easy chemistry between these two, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, that compelled you to root not only for them to reach Manila and succeed but to care for each other.

I hope they continue this story even with the Bourne tag, but I think that they could simply break-away and create deeper/darker more real Cross films.",1346198400,6,1821,4.492447129909365
5156990,3,B008EHZWOU,"Both Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon joked sometime around the release of The Bourne Ultimatum that there would be a fourth movie entitled ""The Bourne Redundancy"". After all, the Bourne book series did go on after Ultimatum, but it wasn't without changes in writers and, sadly, character. And such a book named The Bourne Legacy would indeed be released, except it wasn't released until after Ultimatum. Now I myself will admit I've only read the first two books in the series but not Ultimatum, and it looks like after The Bourne Redundancy... whoops, I mean Legacy, I won't be any time soon.

That isn't to say, however, that The Bourne Legacy is, in any way, a bad movie. Because it isn't. It's got quite a lot going for it. It's just a tad disappointing, is all. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the summer, aside from The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers, both of which were absolutely stellar efforts. I mean, for one, I love the Bourne movies. I remember when my dad and my uncle took me to see The Bourne Supremacy upon its release in 2004. Since then it has become my favourite film in the series and my favourite of the series thus far. The movies it was sandwiched between were great too, though I do consider Ultimatum to be my least favourite of the original three.

The Bourne Legacy takes place at about the same time as the events in Ultimatum. While Bourne is on the run, Alex Cross (Jeremy Renner) is one of a few selected people put on a super soldier program entitled ""Operation Outcome"", run by the CIA. He stays chemically enhanced physically and mentally with a set of multicoloured tablets that he stores in a necklace, named ""chems"". He is to take a different colour at each different stage in the day. While deployed in Alaska for a training program, he pretends that he has run out of chems and stumbles upon another like him, named Number Three, staying with him to get some more chems before returning to civilization.

Meanwhile, the CIA has been giving others in the program a pill that they convince them will mean more chemical enhancement, without having to take multiple pills. This is really their way of shutting the program down, killing them, run by Eric Byer (Edward Norton), a retired air Forster commissioner. After he sends a drone to kill Number Three, he realizes Cross is still on the run, and will do whatever he can to finally kill Cross off. Cross comes across the doctor who provided him with the chems, Dr. Shearing (Rachel Weisz), and finds out a shocking secret about the process of being chemically enhanced and the way his body takes in the drugs, which leads them to Manila for one hell of an explosive climax.

There is quite a bit to like about The Bourne Legacy. For one, Jeremy freakin' Renner. He is instant man crush fuel and this film does not disappoint in that regard. He can act up a storm and he is great for action scenes. And boy, is he beastly in this movie. He has a fair share of great action sequences throughout and if you came specifically to see him slap up some bad guys, then you're in for a treat. Weisz is great as she always is and manages to do an American accent well, with no noticeable slips. The action sequences and chase sequences are fun to watch too, even if the movie becomes just a tad too reliant on action.

But there's too much to hate for the movie too. For one, the story seems to not make much sense. The idea of super soldiers is interesting but they don't do much to explain it, like when they bring in this idea of ""viralling off"". They give a quick description of what it is, they do it, bam, it's left in the dust as if it never existed. And it's never really explained why they want to shut down the program. There was lots more they could have done with such a sinister subject.

Another issue is the characters are flat and boring. Cross himself isn't even that interesting of a character. Even when it's explained how he was put in the program, there isn't much to salvage. It's never a good sign when you don't care about the antagonist too- as the saying goes, ""a movie is only as good as its antagonist"", Byer doesn't do much to lift himself from that trap.

In the third act, the term ""an embarrassment of riches"" comes to mind- the third act is too long, and is just chase scene after chase scene after chase scene and while the climatic motorbike chase is thrilling, at the same time it's just... It's like, the writers forgot the plot and just threw in as many chase scenes as they could.

If anything, think of The Bourne Legacy as a good chase movie. Because that's what it is. It's a decent film that's entertaining and has plenty of great chase scenes and action. But as a Bourne movie... well, it's that in name only, and despite Renner, is just a chase movie disguised in spy movie faff. And while it could have been a much, much worse movie,theres lots of ways it could have been better. By that, I mean ""lots"".",1345939200,2,4946,4.43942731277533
5156991,4,B008EHZWOU,"The fourth film in the Bourne Legacy series (originally authored  by Robert Ludlum), was written and directed by Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, Extreme Measures), along with his brother Dan Gilroy (Real Steel, City of Light), and has a simple but direct approach to making the entire film about eliminating everything that was set up in the first three films. The entire organization of specially programmed people with double agendas is cancelled and this includes killing everyone involved.

Taking the seat front and center now is Jeremy Remer (The Avengers, The Hurt Locker) playing Aaron Cross, a character who starts out with one idea of what his purpose is and then suddenly realizes that he has to avoid the very people who are programing him with drugs. He does a great job as the impartial, intelligent and super-athletic man-killer he is programmed to be while realizing he's now the target of the organizations destruction.

Ironically he finds a friend in the very medical community that is inducing him with his super-human drug addiction, artfully played by Rachel Weizs. Her initial ignorance to the big picture of what she is actually contributing too changes abruptly and she soon learns that Jeremy's character is sincere in his attempts to beat the system that built him.

The movie is filled with fights, killing snipers, running and car chases of incredible detail but with a wonderful visual flow that makes some of these sequences seem a little too unlikely to actually happen in real life.

Some other notable performances include Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legecy) and Edward Norton (The Incredible Hulk, Fight Club) as the people in charge of the agency that decides it needs to shut down its super-spy program. Donna Murphy (Star Trek: Insurrection, Tangeled) put in a small put tough character who realizes Jeremy has figured out that they are after him and he in turn goes after them.

The film is completely more action than story and has some good moments of double jeopardy that you really can't guess which way the action is going. Overall the feel was different from the original Matt Damon series of films which, for me, worked better overall. But this film has some interesting and intense moments and, if you like action, it's here!",1345852800,10,2287,4.973821989528796
5156992,2,B008EHZWOU,"The original Matt Damon BOURNE trilogy is probably the only trilogy of films I've ever seen that got progressively better as the films went on. Doug Liman's THE BOURNE IDENTITY is pretty darn good, and Paul Greengrass' THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is excellent, but Greengrass' finale, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, has become one of those films that I will watch every time it's on. It's just that good. But the unsung hero of all of those films was writer Tony Gilroy, who wrote (or co-wrote) the adaptations to all three previous films and is the co-writer/director of this film. He was smart enough to adapt the books for a more modern era, and make Robert Ludlum's novels cohesive and spry enough to work on the screen by stripping them down to the essentials. When the finale of the BOURNE series hit theaters in 2009, it seemed like a shame since A: star Matt Damon said that he would not return to the role if it wasn't directed by Greengrass and B: Universal would be losing a very lucrative and critically-pleasing franchise. Now, whether doing a Jason Bourne-less BOURNE film was something of a studio decision, or if Gilroy felt that there was more story to tell about the shadowy government programs that birthed agents like Bourne. Either way, we were given THE BOURNE LEGACY, a film that does what it proposes to, but not what it's supposed to do.

From the opening moments of the film, we are given a recognizable image: a figure floating in the water, immobile. But it starts to move and swim and we are introduced to Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), an agent of Project Outcome, which is either the progenitor of agents of Treadstone or Blackbriar, or is one of the newer kids on the block. While he is at a training facility in the wilds of Alaska, all hell is breaking loose at the CIA. Eric Byer (Edward Norton), the head of Project Outcome is looking to destroy all evidence of his program due to the chaos that Bourne unleashed on the agency at the end of ULTIMATUM. This leads to several agents of Outcome being killed, but Outcome isn't just deep-cover agents; it's science. Via gene therapy, each agent takes ""chems"" that alter their intelligence and strength; it doesn't make them superhuman, but it does make them better than your average agent. All the research involved is done at a secret facility within a pharmaceutical conglomerate, and one of those doctors is Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). When the call comes to remove the evidence, all of the researchers are killed except Shearing, and all of the agents except Cross. If we just look at the formula of the BOURNE franchise, it's obvious that these two are destined to meet and form a reluctant partnership based on the mutual needs of the other. With Shearing, she needs Cross to protect her. With Cross, he needs Shearing because he needs his chems so that he can remain strong enough and smart enough to protect himself and her. This leads her to a crash course in Tradecraft 101, leads him to see how he dreads becoming what he used to be, and leads everyone on a collision course.

From here on out, there's going to be some SPOILER territory, so be careful.

As I was watching the film, there were a great many small moments I appreciated; the nail in the fire extinguisher, whatever Cross was doing with the electrical wire and the passports, the use of the laminant on the airline safety cards to create a fake ID, etc. I also really liked the people in it; I think that Renner did a terrific job with what he had to work with as a character. When we see who he was before, it's easy to understand why going back to his previous level of intelligence scares him. He's an effortlessly physical actor, and I appreciated the way that both he and Gilroy differentiated his character from that of Jason Bourne. Cross is inquisitive, talkative, charming and allows himself to be fun, as opposed to Bourne's eternal ennui of identity. Same can be said of Weisz and Franka Potente, but where Marie was more or a free spirit and a passionate woman, Marta is more rigid, a little colder and more fearful because she knows who's out there and I daresay gives her a stronger arc than Marie. Sadly, while I love both Renner and Weisz, I didn't feel a great deal of chemistry between the two. Norton, while still being very good, sadly is very underutilized in this film. He's basically a less screen-active David Strathairn from ULTIMATUM; eternally frustrated with his plans going awry but still calm and seemingly a step ahead. He has no room to breathe, performance-wise, but that's less to do with him and more to do with the script.

The script isn't bad, but it's not good either. Gilroy is an extremely gifted writer and perhaps an even more gifted writer/director as evidenced by the phenomenal drama/thriller MICHAEL CLAYTON and the breezily entertaining espionage rom-com DUPLICITY. But this, co-written with his brother Dan, while exposing us to some new ideas also doesn't bring us many new things. It also lacks the big moments. I liked the introduction of the idea of people like Bourne and his ilk actually being medically enhanced (there's a moment early on where it's pointed out that Bourne was actually the first agent of the program to go as long as he had without the chems, but it's quickly glossed over because this isn't his movie any more) and that the science behind all of this doesn't seem so unreal. The scene at Marta's home is extremely well-done and executed. It had genuine surprises, real tension and some very deftly choreographed action. I also admire the way that this film tried to get away from some of the formula of this franchise, but in doing so, it abandoned some of the things that made it so successful. The first is a lack of a formidable physical antagonist. Where all the previous BOURNE films had that one BIG fight that may have only taken about four or five minutes of screentime, you were breathless for those moments. This film doesn't have any of those; it just has the mini-moments where Cross is fighting multiple opponents, and while that's neat, it doesn't have that impact. You do get something like that in LEGACY, but it becomes a motorcycle duel, and it's just kind of blah. Second, it lacks a mental antagonist that Cross can effectively match wits with. Third and most importantly, it lacks any real emotional journey. Bourne has three films with at least three different journeys of the soul: With IDENTITY, it was literally identity-driven; with SUPREMACY, it was vengeance; with ULTIMATUM, it was the search for truth. With LEGACY, we have fugitives-on-the-run complex where the film gives them the reason to run, but it gives them no place to go to, and that essentially ruins the ride. Does that make the journey entirely not worth taking? No, but it doesn't really give us any reason to want to see what happens with these characters either after the credits start to roll.

Where the film also trips itself up is with all the new ideas it introduces. There's a lot of story they try and pack in to this one film to get it to where they think it needs to progress, but none of it really seems organic.

While there are certainly worse ways to spend an evening, THE BOURNE LEGACY, while having some really good ideas, has far too little to offer the brain and the heart to give you the satisfaction of a good film.

5156993,4,B008EHZWOU,"THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!

""The Bourne Legacy"" begins on the right note:

An inert body floats on the surface of a body of water, seen from underneath--much as Matt Damon did in the opening scene of ""The Bourne Identity,"" which began the previous trilogy.

But, as he abruptly dives down into arctic waters to fetch an important submerged packet we quickly see that this movie is going to be different from that one, though not overly so.  In the end, the opening scene will have let us in on that, too: we're different, but we're similar, too.

First of all, this is a more than enjoyable film that is capably handled and well directed.  I did have some caveats, but you can rest assured your money will be well spent.

This time around, Jeremy Renner is our ""Bourne,"" though in the name of Aaron Cross (or sometimes Number Five).  What's interesting is that this movie takes place in approximately the same time-frame of ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" the final member of the trilogy, which ended with Bourne and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, as a high up muckity muck who has been investigating CIA shenanigans) outwitting the creators of a secret corps of high dollar super soldiers tasked with black ops missions like assassinating foreign bigwigs unfavorable to the U.S., etc.  Cross is a member of Outcome, a fittingly named project in which its agents have been systematically ""enhanced"" genetically, giving them higher mental and physical performance than any previous agents have ever achieved.

Including Bourne, I guess.

Like the previous trilogy, the government officials in charge of these clandestine activities have grown frightened of exposure, and the movie details the officials' cold, calculated murders of Outcome operatives rather than risk their identification.  As one might guess, they let one get away, and for that they will pay dearly.

I suppose, that is...as the movie doesn't show that.  In fact, while Ed Norton is, as always, terrific in the role of one of the bureau chiefs, the old cast of the ""Bourne"" trilogy simply hit their marks one by one and are dismissed, their parts probably taking up a collective minute or two of screen time.  Bourne himself (Matt Damon) was shown only in still shots--I wonder what he got paid for that?  Landy and these others (played by Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Stacey Keech, and David Strathairn) are merely the window dressing meant to show us the tie-in is all part of the same kind of shadow government we all fear are running things anyway.

As to agent Cross, Jeremy Renner looks the part and does a nice job capturing the essence of a trained killer who is as lethal with a gun as he is with a pen, a nail, or whatever else he can get his hands on.  I was a little disappointed that this movie never really tested Renner other than some very clever parkour scenes across the rooftops of Manila to rescue the female scientist who is helping him (Rachel Weisz).

Toward the end of the movie, as our bureau chiefs get really nervous and demand results, they dig up an operative from a NEW government program called Larx (his number is Larx-03), and his use even draws gasps from his handlers, as we find that the Larx(ians?) are bred to be even MORE highly developed physically and have been programmed not to feel pain OR remorse.  This seems a sure setup for a great battle that will let  us check out just how good our Mr. Cross is.  Yet--and I'm not going to tell you how it ends--I was disappointed there too.

All in all I felt ""The Bourne Legacy"" was a worthy spin-off, yet I don't think it really hit its stride.  It took a little too much time setting itself up, held very few real surprises, and didn't have that same improvisational cleverness that Damon's character always seemed to possess--the buffer ""MacGyver,"" if you will.

But Renner looks the right man for the part.  He's got a sweet yet well-traveled face, he certainly seems to be physically capable, and he seems to have the smarts for handling a complex role--if you have any doubts, see him in ""The Hurt Locker.""  And Rachel Weisz is a fine actress, possessing the skills to be both vulnerable and competent at the same time.

But the one I'm looking forward to seeing is any remnant of the Larx  program (gasp!) as his nemesis.  Maybe Larx-04 will test his mettle.

Of course, we could maybe sometime see one of these Gazillion Dollar Soldiers just carry out an actual mission.  I know I'm asking a lot, but in these Recessionary times it would be nice if our Gazillion Dollar Soldiers actually stopped killing each other and actually tackled some enemy bad guys.

This movie is a pathetic attempt to revive a story that has already been told. The first half hour to 45 minutes is mind numbing talk that tries and fail to reel you in with Bourne Ultimatum flashbacks. Renner and Weisz have little or no chemistry. After an hour and a half of agony, I finally left, went home and watched the Bourne Identity.

The people in charge of ALUR didn't know that LOAX was operational (surprise!).  The story is so old, that by the time LOAX 3 becomes operational, we don't even get introduced to his mind-problems, he just does his roof-jumping,motor-biking thing without any sympathy of any kind.  OMG.
Edward Norton is very good, very menacing without having to leave his office/data centre.  Poor old Rachel Weiz, even though she is a very clever doctor, gets to sit in the passenger seat of cars and wince and scream, like all the other Bourne-girlfriends.  She gets to administer medicine, mop furrowed brows, not fall off motor-bikes, and scream for help.  Why can't she be empowered, a-la Catwoman? The Bourne-type character is ok, but suffers from not really being Bourne (Could Bourne be Bourne, with such a plot?  I think its very intelligent of Matt Demon to stay away from this; perhaps he should only return if there's a plot-twist in the next movie, e.g. Jason Bourne becomes a celebrity-chef, and poisons bad guys, or fights obesity or something).

But, that never happens. The film ends in a wrap up of events to this film and to elements of the series, but there may be more coming.  This film had a good idea and the filmmakers really pull it off. Basically, this film has a very interesting and almost intellectual narrative flow that it so incredibly conceived to entertain and draw the viewer in.

And, given the super-soldier treatment he's been subjected to wins in the end.

Some of the stereotypes get a bit thick. Agents of the covert agency wrap themselves in a bizarre patriotism, to swaddle their consciences from the evil they knowingly do - as long as it serves the greater good, as they define the term, that's good enough. The representative scientist within the program has an idealistic naivete about being in it only for the science, and that her personal career sacrifices somehow justify something. There's reality in those characters, though - I've seen similar beliefs, in less exaggerated form, in people I've known.

But I didn't come for a morality play. I came for plenty of adventure, running around, blowing things up, and maybe a side order of chaste romance. I got it. Maybe a few plot elements seemed gratuitous (like LARX, a suitable foil to Our Hero seemingly conjured from nowhere), but the whole came together well.

5156999,3,B008EHZWOU,"I had high expectations for this move and it did not come close to meeting them. Spoiler alert! I talk about some things you might not want to read.

Action: B
The pace of the movie was all wrong and it was way too long for what you got. Some parts really seem to drag out, and just when you think things are finally picking up, they slow down again without any heart racing climax.

Music: D
I don't even think it was the same soundtrack as previous movies. There were no intense moments where the music kicked in and I was like: ""Yes! This is Bourne! This moment right here is proof that this is the best spy series ever made!""

Cool spy stuff: C-
 Remember Jason Bourne taking over the U.S. Embassy, grabbing the map, taking the earpiece, outsmarting his enemies? There weren't many of these moments which is surprising since Aaron Cross was supposed to be super smart from his brain chemicals.

New Bourne: C
It is hard to judge Renner's performance because I did not like the character Aaron Cross. They gave him way too much personality. I mean come on, aren't ""assets"" supposed to be trained killer, human cyborgs with no emotions? Cross was telling jokes and he was questioning the moral implications of his orders/actions way too much. Just shut up, go into killer machine mode, and destroy everything as efficiently as possible. That's what I want to see, not your ethical growth as a character.

Fight scenes: B
Not as good as part 1 and 3, but way better than part 2 which had that weird camera thing going on.

Chase scene: B -
A few good ones, but I think the producers are starting to equate the length of the chase with the quality of the chase. The roof jumping was something we have seen before (better) in part 3. The motorcycle scene had intensity, but I was kind of disappointed when Marta killed the toughest, baddest, assassin ever trained by man. We should definitely have seen a hand-to-hand combat scene or knife fight with this guy.

CIA (Or whoever they were): C -
Norton was good in the beginning of the movie, but didn't bring it the second half. The woman CIA agent who takes over Landy's job of ""quarterbacking"" things gave a poor performance. I didn't find her believable at all, but that was probably because the actress playing Landy was perfect for that role. The rest of the intelligence crew seemed weak too. Someone dropped the ball here. This was something the first three films all got right.

Overall: B -
Lecacy was still a good flick and I will probably still buy it on DVD. Had this been the only Bourne movie ever made, then maybe this movie would have gotten an A -. But by comparison, this movie was definitely the worst of the four movies.",1345161600,3,2688,4.480572597137014

Gilroy casts experienced competent actors that give depth to the film, and he employs a minimalist style that works with well the action scenes, which are by far the best part of the movie.  There's a lot of continuity with the last movie of the franchise, and subtle twists that suggest that the sequels will be much darker and much more global.

By the way, the Bourne movies have very little relation to the Robert Ludlum series.  If you enjoy the movies, you ought to check out the books as well -- entertaining reads.",1345161600,3,696,4.634146341463414

5157003,4,B008EHZWOU,"I wanted to see ""The Dark Knight Rises"" but lost to this picture. It turned out to be nicely presented.

This Bourne refresh does a fine job of living up to its legacy partly through the acting abilities of Jeremy Renner who does a great job of playing the guy who can emotionally disarm people and/or even calm them down, as well as through the acting abilities of Ed Norton, who  plays the main antagonist trying to shut down a special operation gone bad. Norton's character keeps the pace moving when we are not focused on Renner's ""adventures"" in the film.

It's a fun, sometimes introspective cat and mouse picture that spans all over the globe with some definitive focuses in various parts of Asia which felt like a fresh enough touch.

Action scenes are creative enough and the story is pretty good for its plotting and payoffs (look for the gold watch he gets off the Aussie and then changes wrists at the end) rather than its overall idea. That's probably a good thing as the really good ideas of Hollywood are sometimes poorly executed. Stringing the various elements together is much harder to pull off.

It's hard to talk about the story without giving things away so I won't say much of anything. That said, if you want spoilers read below. The trailer talked about DNA and genetic manipulations so you should go in without any general surprises in that area.

Ed Norton's character, one of the distant antagonists, had the best metaphorical dialogue. It also starred a number of known names which included: Albert Finney, an older Rachel Weisz and Joan Allen.

The budget for this film was $130M and after only several days it has already made a bit over $88M at the Box Office. Impressive by Box Office standards but don't expect it to get Best Picture.

The Jason Bourne character incidentally was created by novelist Robert Ludlum though this particular move title was based on a novel by Eric Van Lustbader. The movies deviate greatly from the actual novels.

There are number of homages to the movie trilogy especially in the music. Notice the ending song by Moby.

CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; ACTION SCENES: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2012 (at the movies); OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.

SPOILERS: I liked the idea with the pills and how the special ops needed them to survive (though this is by no means a super original idea). The ending finale had a good enough action scene in which the female lead got to control how things would go down versus the enemy special ops dude. Obviously, these special ops were all modified. I liked how the enemy special ops actually stopped to sniff for the main character and then tracked him on scent.

I suppose I will always know Rachel Weisz from the first two ""Mummy"" movies of the trilogy with Brendan Fraser so that look has stuck with me. I didn't recognize her until the credits rolled. Sorry, Rachel.

5157006,4,B008EHZWOU,"SPOILERS!

First off, Jeremy Renner's physical prowess is mesmerizing!  His action shots in the movie are simply breathtaking. His character Aaron Cross is also more interesting than Jason Bourne, in that Aaron had intelligence issues prior to being introduced into the program - Outcome.  He also appears to have had a brain injury - so he is no wunderkind to begin with.

The movie is slow and they spend a lot of time unnecessarily showing Aaron roaming around in Alaska - we get it - within 2 minutes we understand what he's doing.  No need to drag it out for 40 minutes.

Edward Norton doesn't seem like the right fit - he's simply not commanding enough in his role.

Rachel Weisz - I love her but I wish she would stop using a fake American accent - it's too distracting when her emphasis is wrong.  She often sounds like a Brit doing a bad mocking impression of a US accent.  I was also surprised at how she fumbled around with some of the medical paraphernalia while looking very unsure of herself.  Strange for an actress at her level.  She should have paid a few visits to a hospital prior to filming to see how it's really done.  It looked like she had never touched medical equipment before.

What is nice is that there is tenderness between her character Marta and Aaron Cross that develops during the course of the movie - much more refreshing than all out awkward love scenes could possibly be.

The whole movie is basically a setup for the next two movies when the fun will really begin.  This is a filler movie.  The weakest of the four so far, but still very entertaining and very much worth watching.",1344902400,,1619,4.493150684931507
5157007,3,B008EHZWOU,"Apparently not as we keep paying to see them.  And you're going to get a couple of them in this movie with the likable stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Shearing doing the running as the big, bad secret government agency tries to track them down and kill them.  Renner, an engaging actor who has shown some chutzpah in a variety of movies including ""The Town"", ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"", and ""The Hurt Locker"", does not play a copycat Bourne here.  Renner's Cross character has his memories and knows who he is and rather likes himself; he's also capable of making his own moral choices.  As such he floats above the proceedings here.  Gone is the jigsaw fuzzy puzzle of finding out his identity which made the original Bourne and it's sequels sharply compelling.  In its place is Cross' need to get his hands on a drug that will keep his mind sharp and he saves Weisz's Dr. Shearing so that the two become a team and accomplish this mission.  But there isn't any real saving the day here as it is about saving the man; it's Bourne lite actually.  It's got a lot of action and some moments of intensity and you can follow it (as it jags back and forth a few times with memory revelations the main story seems to be taking place and progressing as the other Bourne actions were taking place) but there is a lot of throwaway references to Treadstone and Blackbrier and such by a lot of good actors in board rooms that amounts to essentially a bunch of talking heads repeatedly telling us how critical it is to stop the public from finding out the big, bad secrets.  Gone is the dogged determination of the Pamela Landy character's determination to find the truth and the truth here is that the film suffers for it.  Renner gives some cool and light humor touches to his uber-agent and is the real reason to see this film but it does pale in comparison to the Damon outings.  And that, my friends, is the honest to Bourne truth.  3.5 stars, at least for its pedigree.",1344902400,,2000,4.464285714285714

It honestly felt like an arthouse film. It could have been saved with massive editing. Honestly, I can't ever recommend watching this film. The acting was superb, I will let that be clear.

5157009,4,B008EHZWOU,"Has Matt Damon given up the Bourne movies? He excelled as Jason Bourne and is a hard act to follow. Bourne Legacy is less of a sequel, and more of a spin off.

Certainly elements of it work very well. Jeremy Renner brings his own brand of intensity to the role, and I like Rachel Weisz as the doctor with whom he goes on the run. I loved the way the scene in her house unfolded with all its twists and turns.

Renner plays a character not named Bourne, but a former soldier named Aaron Cross. Unlike Bourne he remembers everything but seems to be unaware that he was part of a sinister experiment testing for biological weaponry, and he constantly needs medication or something bad will happen.

It's several years later. Treadstone has become an embarrassment, requiring clean up before it gets even more embarrassing.

In covert parlance cleanup means kill. He has been part of a biological warfare experiment though he seems unaware of this, and has to take certain medication. He does have mad lethal skills like Bourne, and he is extremely resourceful. So he becomes the loose end that fights back.

Edward Norton brings his A game as the spook on his trail, giving an outstanding performance and the array of technology at his disposal is impressive.

Matt Damon's Bourne movies are a hard act to follow, nevertheless Bourne Legacy does have its moments. I liked the fact that the answer to the problem lay in the Phillipines, and Cross is resourceful enough to fake a passport with new identities while both he and the doctor are being searched for at the highest levels, and the impressive technology being used to catch them is actually pretty scary. I also found the drone sequences in the wilderness very engaging.

Can they really do all this?

I particularly liked the action sequences particularly the motorbike chase scene in the Philippines, and how the doctor initially lacking any defense skills before she meets Cross, now gets some aggression and contributes realistically to a memorable action sequence, while will probably be the strongest memory I take from this movie.

If you are a Bourne fan, and seen all the movies, your reaction might be similar to mine, I found it a worthwhile experience, and I think that most people having enjoyed the previous Bourne movies will enjoy this too. I hope this was helpful.",1344729600,3,2336,4.762376237623762
5157010,4,B008EHZWOU,"Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are excellent. Edward Norton may just be the best actor on the planet. So where does this movie go wrong? There are two problems with the latest Bourne entry: The script and the editing. The basic premise of ""shut the program down"" meaning ""kill everyone involved"" is unoriginal, unimaginative, and basically just plain stupid. Mass murders lead to more congressional probes, more attention, greater risk- not less. Oh, and let's murder all the lab geeks and send a 5 man highly trained hit team in to take out the lone surviving tech. Sure... why not? That sounds like a great way to avert suspicions.
  The second problem is the editing. It starts out with promise. The opening scenes are well done, and it felt like ""Bourne"" should feel. Tense, highly technical, state of the art and beautifully shot. Later on however, things just bog down. We didn't need to see a bald lab tech taking out everyone in the room- not for 10 minutes. Hey, this guy wasn't Arnold Schwarzenegger- someone should have thrown their pocket calculator at his temple- scene over, everyone's safe! Then it gets good again- the scene at the Doctor's house is once again ""Bourne"" like- very well shot, and Renner is just great!
  My final gripe- the chase scene in Manilla is another ""editor gone wild""- just awful. You throw about 1,000 ""cut shots"" at us in rapid machine gun fashion, and we're supposed to be in awe. No, we're just nauseated. This same mistake was made in the car chase at the end of Bourne 2 in Russia. Rapid cut shots...arrrrrgh!
  The set up for a sequel is a good thing. We want to see Aaron Cross and Jason Bourne in the same movie. Bring back Pamela Landy and several other old characters from the Bourne trilogy and it could be fantastic! Please bring back Edward Norton but give him a better script. We want to see him as the grand master, playing a life and death chess match against Pamela, Jason, and Aaron. Can't wait!",1344729600,,1955,4.619596541786744
5157011,4,B008EHZWOU,"With Matt Damon having departed as the charismatic Jason Bourne after three movies, the producers had to come up with a clever way to keep this franchise moving forward. They could either simply take another actor continue the role of Jason Bourne (much in the same way that the James Bond franchise keeps it going), or they could come up with a new story line separate (but not apart) from Jason Bourne. The producers decided on the latter.

""The Bourne Legacy"" (135 min.) introduces us to Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), who is another Jason Bourne-like former Army soldier rescued and enhanced by an experimental CIA program. For reasons not entirely made clear (to me anyway), the decision is made to shut down this program and all of the field agents are cast off, with the sole exception of Aaron Cross, who manages to dodge the various attempts on his life. Meanwhile we are also introduced to Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz), who is involved in the running of the program, and for reasons I don't want to explain so as not to spoil too much of the plot, now also is running for her life. Aaron and Marta team up, and how exactly it all plays out, you will just have to see it for yourself.

Several comments: there are a number of hair-raising action scenes, none more so than in the last 45 min. of the movie, at which point all of the action takes places in Manila, the Phillipines. The action scenes are staged brilliantly and are never so over the top that they become laughable. Jason Renner does a great job in bringing us ""the next Jason Bourne"". But Rachel Weisz is the REAL star in my opinion. This is the 3rd time in short order that I've seen her recently in the theatres (after Dream House and The Deep Blue Sea), and she completely transfixes me, as she does again in this movie. Kudos also to writer-director (and ""Bourne"" veteran) Tony Gilroy, for bringing it all together in a credible and thoroughly enjoyable way. In the end, ""The Bourne Legacy"" exceeded all my expectations, and as such is an outstanding addition to the ""Bourne"" franchise. Can't wait for the next installment already!",1344729600,4,2131,4.605263157894737
5157012,4,B008EHZWOU,"""The Bourne Legacy"" is an artful attempt to add to the Bourne movie series by taking the story sideways. A secret project called Outcome has improved on the super-agents of the original Project Treadstone through chromosomal manipulation. We meet one of its products, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on survival training in Alaska, as the movie begins. As the movie unspools, we further learn that Cross's agency has decided to terminate the Outcome project with extreme prejudice, due to the unfavorable publicity of Jason Bourne's struggle with the CIA.

In a suspenseful action sequence, Cross will survive a termination attempt in Alaska and escape. Inside the Outcome Laboratory, somewhere near Washington DC, Doctor Marta Shearing (Rachel Waitz) and her co-workers are also assaulted. Marta survives the attack in the lab, only to be pursued to her home in the country. In a second very good action sequence, Marta will be forced to trust her rescuer Cross and to face the consequences of her scientific work. Cross and Marta will go on the run to the Philippines, with Outcome in close pursuit, paving the way for a final, frenetic chase sequence in crowded Manila.

""The Bourne Legacy"" features a number of well-executed action sequences. Renner and Waitz make a good team and are backed by a strong supporting cast, including Edward Norton and Stacy Keach. However, ""Legacy"" never quite achieves the compelling, suspensefully paranoid atmosphere of the original Jason Bourne movies. The heart of the mystery has already been given away, while the uneven pacing, the simplicity of the plot device that drives Cross's sense of urgency, and the flat ending were a little disappointing.  ""The Bourne Legacy"" is entertaining but not quite in the class of its predecessors.",1344643200,,1773,5.170731707317073
5157013,5,B008EHZWOU,"I did not want this film to end. I love action movies, but I usually want them to stop 10-20 minutes before they do. Not this one. Seriously, I just wanted the story to keep going.

I have greatly admired Jeremy Renner's acting ability for years, but I was worried about anyone following Matt Damon. I need not have worried.

Fabulous story, beautifully filmed (all over the world), and Renner is once again one of the best actors around. Rachael Weiz has the unenviable role of the beautiful helpless woman caught up in a mess, and she makes the character worth caring about. Ed Norton creates a complex bad guy with layers of ethical conflict making it impossible to hate him.

Tony Gilroy wrote the screenplay and directed it--he wrote the first three screenplays too. Boy, he did a darn good job of all four. Gilroy is the third director to take on Bourne (Identity-Limon, Supremecy and Ultimatum-Greengrass) and I would be hard pressed to choose a favorite. Like the 1st three, it moves fast and assumes you have a brain. No hand fed information here. You gotta keep up.

Also, I must mention, when Jeremy Renner smiles it's nigh on to impossible to look away...",1344643200,4,1167,4.650485436893204
5157014,4,B008EHZWOU,"After seeing this movie, I took a peek at several professionally written reviews.  Some of the criticism was that the movie was loud with too much action.  Others said it was too wordy or dialog driven and short on thrills.  For me it was just about perfect.  Another criticism is that the studio is milking the 3 Matt Damon led predecessors.  Of course that's true but so what?  The Bourne franchise has plenty left, so let's just go with it.

Helmed this time by Tony Gilroy (""Michael Clayton"") who was a screenwriter for the previous Bourne's, the film does start slow and without much explanation.  Our new hero is secret agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner, ""The Avengers""), who like Jason Bourne is a military/CIA medical experiment.  He is in the snowy mountains of Alaska (actually shot in Iceland) on a survival training mission, but is running low on pills (""chems"") he needs to survive.  He doesn't know that he and a small group like him are being eliminated as a super duper secret layer of the American intelligence network is about to be outed by Bourne (never seen) and his boss from the previous film, Pam Landy (Joan Allen, briefly).

The new boss man is Eric Byer (Edward Norton) who pulls out all the stops to get Cross, the last of his class of spies.  I've given up trying to filter through the various government spy agencies.  If you think the CIA is it, think again.  There are secret levels and layers that I don't think anyone can keep count of.  And forget about trying to understand the medical/genetic/viral mumbo jumbo.  Just understand that Bourne needs ""chems"" or a variant to survive.  Aiding him in his quest and escape is his government provided doctor (Rachel Weisz doing a fine American accent) who's also on the run.

Once the action begins it rarely lets up.  Unlike the Bourne films where close combat is one of the tent poles, ""Legacy"" relies more upon the Parkour style of running across rooftops of slums for some of the action.  We've seen this in too many films.  Enough already.  Having said that, the film enjoys some excellent action sequences that slow down just enough to allow everyone to catch their breath and calculate the next move.  More Bourne?

5157015,2,B008EHZWOU,"This movie was a huge disappointment.  It was just a rip off of the earlier Jason Bourne movies which I enjoyed. There wasn't much plot or suspense, but plenty of ridiculous chase scenes. The motorcycle chase at the end lasted forever. So did the movie which ran two and a half hours.

Jason Bourne is referred to, but this plot had nothing whatsoever to do with him. A new agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is introduced. When the scientific research supporting genetic testing on agents is discontinued, everyone on the project must be eliminated.

I guess they tied this movie to the popular Bourne movies to pull people in. That's not a good idea if they ever intend to do another real Jason Bourne film.",1344643200,5,718,4.637795275590551
5157016,2,B008EHZWOU,"Jeremy Renner is Aaron Cross; the new Jason Bourne. It feels like Renner is trying so hard to make this character work. Cross is so sarcastic, quick witted, and smart mouthed. It's difficult not to like him and Renner does the absolute best job he can with the character. Producer Frank Marshall has been so adamant about a fifth movie possibly seeing Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner team up. The issue is ""The Bourne Legacy"" seems to be banking on that idea so much that this just feels like filler. You have this new character who knows exactly what he signed up for and realizes what can and will happen when everything goes wrong; he's essentially the exact opposite of Jason Bourne. But the Aaron Cross character doesn't really go anywhere. As soon as things finally start to get somewhat interesting, you find yourself walking out of the theater.

The rest of the cast mostly just feels like they were thrown in to act astonished at Aaron Cross' actions. Edward Norton was a huge drawing factor, but really only has a few memorable one-liners. His ""moral excrement"" conversation with Cross is quite possibly the most intriguing scene in the movie though. Rachel Weisz can usually be counted on to give a great performance, as well. Her character, Dr. Marta Shearing, seems so melodramatic though. Nearly everything that happens to her before she meets up with Cross is so ridiculously overdramatic and she does nothing but cry. Thankfully, her chemistry with Jeremy Renner saves her performance from being a complete waste. Their conversation in the car as Dr. Shearing explains the specifics of the blue and green pills is fascinating and fairly intelligent.

""The Bourne Legacy"" does do a few things right. It does have a few semi-long one-take shots. ""Semi-long"" meaning longer than the rest of the ridiculously fast edits scattered throughout the rest of the film. The best example is when Aaron runs up the side of a house, climbs up the roof, opens the window, gets inside the house, and immediately shoots somebody in the head. There's also this pretty great motorcycle chase that had shades of ""Terminator 2"" in it. Cross's interaction with the wolves seemed like this huge shout out to ""The Grey,"" which should only be seen as a good thing.

The problem with the Bourne franchise is that the camera work is so dizzying; the camera tries to move faster than Jason Bourne or Aaron Cross does and it leaves you feeling kind of nauseous. ""The Bourne Legacy"" doesn't have an ending. Everything just stops. The biggest action sequence in the entire movie transpires, then it gives you a calm moment to catch your breath. But it doesn't follow up with anything afterward. It is pretty much left at, ""I'm just seeing what our options are."" If your movie has a bigger open ending than the average horror film, then you've got a problem.

""The Bourne Legacy"" mostly just comes off feeling as disposable as the agents in the program. It's a dull excuse of a thriller that is incapable of satisfying that fictitious salivating gland deep within your soul that craves heavy action and adrenaline pumping adventure. The ball has officially been dropped. Now we play the waiting game to see if anyone even noticed.",1344643200,5,3211,4.811594202898551
5157017,4,B008EHZWOU,"Other reviewers have already recounted much of the plot.  So, I'll skip that and go to a critique of the production itself.

I gave this an overall rating of four stars because I found the movie to be interesting, engaging, with a good story and some really good action scenes.  I found that I cared about the primary characters - Renner and Weisz.  This tells me that the characters were fairly well developed and interesting

Renner's character, Aaron Cross, would have been more compelling if more of his backstory came out sooner, and if his pathetic origin were presented differently.  I think Weisz' character could have used more backstory too - all I know about her is that she's an attractive scientist with a top secret clearance.

The story is really good.  But this movie could have been a classic if the plot were tightened up and presented differently - too much dialogue where 'showing' instead of 'talking' would have got it across to the viewer better - this is especially true during the first part of the film.

The camera work was excellent.  With more experience, I think Gilroy's skills in this area will improve to a level near Greengrass' excellent abilities.  Also, there's lots of good acting in this movie.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the critics are currently tabulating at 51% positive, while the audience is at 70%.  I think the critics (overall) are getting it wrong - primarily, I think, because they're comparing it to the high standards set by the previous Bourne movies.

This is a high-quality production that tells a good story.  In addition, I felt an emotional connection with the main characrters - I cared about them.  For these reasons, I strongly recommend it.",1344643200,192,1696,4.8166089965397925
5157018,2,B008EHZWOU,"Going to the midnight showing of The Bourne Legacy I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I had with other movies I've had doubts with. Like I had doubts with when I went to see the Bourne Identity, but before I get to my opinion of the film I must first talk about the films that came before. After all Legacy is a continuation and a direct sequel to the Bourne films, so I must first talk about the previous films a little first. Back in 2001 and 2002 leading up to the Bourne Identity I had only remembered seeing Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan and Good Will Hunting nor had I heard of the books Identity was based off of, so I had my doubts about the film. Still I took a chance and was happily surprised. The Bourne Identity was a great film. The action wasn't over the top like much of the action films of the 1980's and 1990's. It had a unique story, which at the time I don't remember it having been done like it had with this film. The characters were interesting, and the music was great. The film led me to Robert Ludlum novels the film was based off of. I read his three Bourne novels and I must admit I enjoyed the Identity and the rest of the films more then I like the novels. Right now I can only think of one other time that has happened, and it was with The Lord of the Ring series. I enjoyed the novels, but they weren't truly great books. The films on the other hand were great especially the first two. When The Bourne Supremacy came out in 2004 I had no doubts about the film or Mat Damon this time. It was a great film, and that was even with them killing of Marie an important character from the books and a character I liked. That's how good Supremacy was for me, and who could forget the car chase seen in Moscow with Karl Urban. It's one of the best car chases scenes of all time along with the likes of Bullitt, The French Connection, Ronin and The Road Warrior. When The Bourne Ultimatum came out in 2007 it had a lot to live up to, and through I thought it would be good I didn't think it could surpass Supremacy, but again I was wrong. Ultimatum was as good if not better than its predecessor. That's a rarity in films and franchises for a third sequel to be as good if not better than the film that came before. Right now I can only think of a few films like The Revenge of the Sith, The Dark Knight Rises and Alien 3. Ultimatum was a great film and had a good ending. I know the studio and director left an opening for another film, but in my opinion they should had let sleeping dogs lie. Robert Ludlum had stopped writing Bourne novels back in 1990. I know Eric Van Lustbader is a capable writer, but Ludlum had finished Bourne's journey and the novels feel forced. Matt Damon was moving on, and so was Paul Greengrass. If Universal really wanted to continue with the franchise it should have gotten down on its hands and knees and begged those two to come back, and pay them whatever they wanted. You can see why I had my doubts about Legacy. Still with that being said I'd still gave it a chance like I had with Matt Damon and Identity back in 2002, which leads us to Bourne Legacy.

Where to begin? Where to begin? I could start with the lackluster action, the uninteresting characters. No I'll start with the forced story. When I saw the trailers it looked like they were trying to turn Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) into some kind of super soldier. If I want to see a movie with super heroes in it I'd go to see any of the super hero films that come out every few months now a days. That was what was so good about the Bourne films. Sure Jason Bourne was government trained killer, but he was still human, and could get hurt. It's one of the reason's the films were so good. In Legacy they tried to destroy what was so good about the previous films with the story about genetics and drugs turning people into super soldiers. Then there is Gilory trying to force his failed story into the Bourne universe. It's like a child trying to force a square peg into a round opening it just isn't going to work. That's what it feels like in this film as director and writer Gilory tries to force his story with Bourne's. Sure Gilory was the writer for the previous films, but he had inspiration from Ludlum's books. If he created this screenplay on his own then he needs to stick to adapting screenplays from novels, because he can't do it on his own. Maybe Universal forced him to do it this way after all I know they were desperate to keep this franchise going. If so then I can forgive him for his lackluster to bad screen play. The only thing or person that truly saves the story is Aaron Cross. His story is compelling especially how he came to be part of the program and who he was before it. The character kept me interested in the film.

I like Jeremy Renner. I remember him from the average S.W.A.T. remake along with his good performance in 28 Weeks Later, and his great performance in The Hurt Locker. He is a really good actor. He was one of the truly bright spots character wise in The Avengers as Hawkeye. Sure he should have, but didn't have a lot of screen time, but he did a lot with what he had, and in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol again he was one of the truly bright spots. It's the same with Legacy. He brings emotion and depth to the character, but just like in The Avengers and Ghost Protocol I thought he was short changed as Gilory didn't spend enough time with the Renner/Cross as he spend most of the first part of the film trying to force his story into the Bourne Universe. Besides Renner I can't think of anyone who had a good performance, and that's a shame because this film had a pretty good cast of actors. Edward Norton was forgettable in this film. Stacy Keach was underused. Scott Glenn who I like as an actor was pointless in this film as again he was only used to try and force this story into the franchise. The only one who remotely came close to truly standing out was Rachel Weisz (Marta Shearing). Her character was interesting, and I do like the actress and character, but she reminded me a lot of Marie, which is another thing about the story in this film. It's as if Gilory was trying to reboot the franchise and made it similar to The Bourne Identity.

The action which was great in the previous films felt underwhelming in The Bourne Legacy. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that were good. One in a lab which was riveting, and one in a house out in the woods, which I thought was well done. Still the rest was just underwhelming, and the climax, well the climax action scene was just a letdown. Gilory could have done so much, but it was basically a rehash of a scene in one of the previous films. I expect better action from the Bourne franchise.

I'm not sure what involvement Universal had in the directing and writing of this film, but if they didn't have much it speaks to what kind of director and writer Tony Gilory is, and like I said earlier as a writer Gilory had the benefit of a source material with the previous films. Now Gilory was on his own with the story. Trying to create his own story that fit into the universe of Bourne and it doesn't work. As a writer he's basically adapted screenplays from their source material and I think he should stick to that. As a director again I question why Universal chose him. Sure he has made one good film in Michael Clayton, but he has directed only two films before. He's never directed action scenes before and you can tell from watching the Legacy.

Overall watching this The Bourne Legacy is watching the death of a franchise. There are only two ways this franchise is going to continue/survive. One is that it makes a ton of money, which I don't see happening or Universal gets on its hands and knees and begs Matt Damon to come back to try and save this franchise. That being said this isn't a horrible film. It's just a representation of a studio trying to keep a franchise alive out of greed. I think the Bourne Legacy could have worked if they had hired a better writer and director and didn't try to force the story into the Bourne universe. It's sad because Jeremy Renner is a really good actor and does a good job in this film with what he has. Still I think the studio should have let the franchise die after Matt Damon and Greengrass didn't come back. The Bourne Legacy isn't a terrible film or bad one it's just a below average action film that shouldn't have been made, and I can't recommend anyone see in the theater. Wait for Redbox.",1344556800,10,8537,4.28359133126935
5157019,4,B008EHZWOU,"(Note: I will update this when I get the Blu-ray).

The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance, as even more memories start to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken). Actually, for a while Universal Studios had been negotiating another Bourne movie with Damon, but he said he'd only take the role if Greengrass was directing. The two of them had signed on for something, at the very least, but things never fell through for another sequel, and the tandem would go on to make Green Zone (a pretty engaging military conspiracy thriller in itself, but that's for another review).

Instead of Damon and Greengrass doing another Jason Bourne entry, we have something of a spinoff. The Bourne Legacy was written by Eric Van Lustbader and merely inspired by Robert Ludlum's work, so I guess you can't say there's really a ""direct"" correlation in terms of source material deviation. On the other hand, this new entry was written and directed by Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplays for the first 3 films, wrote/directed Michael Clayton, and wrote the story for State of Play (both being excellent thrillers in their own right). He also wrote/directed Duplicity, which I guess could technically fall under the thriller genre, but the romantic comedy elements made it feel like something else entirely. So how did Gilroy's third directing project go?

The story begins in the snowy mountains of Alaska where Outcome agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is undergoing survival training. Meanwhile, news of Blackbriar's demise and the controversy surrounding it have forced Outcome's director Eric Byer (Edward Norton) into action after evidence had surfaced linking the founders of both Treadstone/Blackbriar and Outcome together. In an effort to stop this trail from leading back to them, Byer decides to shut the program down and burn it to the ground, eliminating any and all personnel involved. When a scientist for the program, Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), witnesses the murder of her colleagues, she and Cross become the remaining loose ends and must survive on the run to discover the answers behind the conspiracy.

My favorite thing about the movie is its maintaining of realism. Just like how cool it was for Bourne to escape every situation by a hair's breadth or for him to set up the ultimate of break-ins and steal something vital, I'd say this was about as realistic as what was shown in Greengrass' films. Not ""realistic"" in the sense of believability, per se, but in the sense of how things could work out. The element of improvisation is still there in Cross, and while his end results may not be as flashy as when Bourne is outsmarting or outwitting an entire task force, many of Cross' scenes are still entertaining to watch. And a lot of it has to do with Renner's performance. The character he portrays isn't nearly as mysterious as Damon's originally was, but it's a very likeable one. This is only the 4th movie I've ever seen him in (the others being The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and The Avengers), but it's really the only other starring role I've seen him do, and I think he does a great job. He has a good amount of charisma and enough ferocity in his action sequences to be revered and feared, and depending on where they go after this, I hope he really gets a chance to shine like Damon did as Bourne.

I also love that they got Edward Norton to play the antagonist. He's a brilliant actor to begin with, and to see him as something of a villain was a real treat. He's always had a natural ability to take command on screen, and his role as Byer is no exception. Pretty much any time he's talking, it's hard not to pay attention to him, even if the other characters on screen with him are of a higher rank. His performance feels very intelligent and shadowy enough, but I was hoping the story would've allowed for him to show a meaner side every now and then. It's a very convincing role, and again, if they end up making a sequel I would love for him to return and hope that they write even more opportunities for him to become a well-developed character.

And finally, I thought the scientific approach to the black ops program was a nice touch. Jason Bourne was more about the personal side of a cold-blooded assassin re-discovering his humanity and atoning for all the people he killed, which, symbolically, makes for great cinema. But the explanation on how he became so skilled in everything was just a given. We're to assume he's just good at what he does, and that's that. Here, the capabilities of an agent are, perhaps, less cool to think about in terms of ""yeah, he kicks ass,"" just because he can. Aaron Cross seems more like he has the knowledge of things, but the lack of extreme force makes the overall tone of everything he does seem more down-to-earth. Although, I guess a lot of it has to do with the cinematography and editing as well (most of the trademark Greengrass shaky-cam is gone this time around). All in all, it feels nice to know where some of these talents and skills are coming from.

Now on to the actual movie. It's slow, but fast. I know that's a weird way to describe it, but it really is. When I say ""slow,"" I mean the pacing is at about the same speed as The Bourne Identity. Throughout the film, you're given pieces of the plot, the occasional flashback to fill in some of the gaps or to develop Cross, and it all slowly builds towards a climax. And when I say ""fast,"" I mean that I was so engrossed in trying to fit the pieces together, by the time I knew it, the movie was over. It's odd that for barely over 2 hours I was really wanting to know more about Cross' and Byer's pasts, what the true scope and reach of the genetic engineering project was, and just how many of these black ops programs really existed. And then there was this big chase sequence at the end, and it was done. I will say that if you go into this expecting a similar style to Identity, you'll be disappointed. The amnesia thing for Bourne was unique and his working backwards to find the truth was even more so. It was a plot of mystery and intrigue that was kind of pre-established already and Bourne just had to pick up the pieces. That's not the case here with Cross.

As a character, the flashbacks work as a device to build him, slowly and thoroughly, but he already knows who he is. I firmly believe that if this film is financially successful enough that they'll continue to try and develop his character forwards, instead of backwards. I think that if they're smart enough to write a good story arc for his character, they'll include more and more flashbacks working their way up to a realization of what he can or does become. And to achieve this, I'm a little on the fence about the inclusion of Shearing. As talented as Weisz is, her character felt a tad over-reactive and panicky at times, which added a little too much of a ""damsel in distress"" quality to the rest of the film (i.e. makes her look weak). I suppose it makes sense to mimic the male-female coupling for the search of truth so they can rely on one-another. But like Franka Potente said about playing Marie, her character wasn't as clich and the chemistry between Bourne and her was purposely sporadic. I just hope the relationship between Cross and Shearing doesn't become too melodramatic at some point. Then again, they could always kill her, too.

Picture-wise, I saw this on a digital projector at my local Cinemark. The movie itself was shot on 35mm and processed digitally and looks pretty spectacular. As much as I loved the documentary shaky-cam aesthetic Greengrass employed in his films, the one drawback to it was that the picture never really stayed still long enough for you to just look at something in a still frame and enjoy it, aside from the occasional scenic overhead shot of a city that lasted for all but 2 or 3 seconds until it zoomed in and cut to the next shaky shot. Here, Robert Elswit's photography has a much wider lens view, and yes, more static shots. Elswit also worked on Mission Impossible 4, which also starred Renner, ironically, and I think that may have influenced the wider shots after working with the IMAX cameras for that one. In terms of editing, the task is performed by Tony's brother John, and is also a lot less kinetic. Closeup shots are used about as much as they had been in the other Bourne films since the dialogue is so important, but I like that even without the quick cuts during action sequences, it sacrifices intensity for appreciation of the actual choreography. For the stunts, they brought back Dan Bradley who directed all the stunt work in the previous films, and the fights were coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio who was an assistant in the fights of Ultimatum and the lead choreographer for Haywire (really love the fights in that movie).

Music-wise, James Newton Howard takes over for John Powell. I will stress that I absolutely loved Powell's work for the first 3 movies and that Bourne's main theme and the pulsating drums of his action pieces are one of the best sounds I've heard for any action movie outside of Hans Zimmer. Howard doesn't quite capture the same essence, but again, this is a completely different cast of characters. Thematically, he does manage to sneak in a little bit of Bourne's theme into some of his pieces, but only faintly and probably as a reminder that this movie is part of the franchise. The overall sound, however, is a lot more contemporary and even has some electric guitar in it. The more upbeat percussionist pieces used for the action sequences also carry a similar beat akin to Powell's, though are a little more variant with other instruments around it. In listening to the soundtrack, there doesn't seem to be a central theme or motif within any one piece to represent Cross' character, which is a little disappointing. As a whole, though, the score makes for great ambiance. And hopefully, if any sequels are made and become more action-packed, Howard will reach into his bag for some more up-tempo tricks.

Overall, my expectations weren't set too high, but I was pleasantly surprised at this new character. The story has less mystery and intrigue, but instead a more linear approach to it, with Jason Bourne only being a reference point. The ""Legacy"" is more so about the super-soldier learning to think for himself and bailing a corrupted system as per Bourne's example. Even Greengrass stated in his commentaries that the villains weren't really bad guys, they were just part of a bad system. And with the potential to take the franchise in, hopefully, a newer, even fresher direction with Aaron Cross, something will come of it, be it Gilroy returning to write, direct, or whatever. Nowhere left to go now, but forward.
