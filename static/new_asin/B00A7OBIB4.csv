5392726,3,B00A7OBIB4,"Abducted is about what you would expect for a movie made for TV.  The film was first broadcast on Lifetime as ""Layover"", but the name was updated apparently so that the DVD might appeal to a broader audience. The DVD cover features a member of the cast (Tara Erica Moore), but it in no way reflects any parts of this movie. For the most part, Abducted is a cross between ""Taken"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada.""

Abducted follows the story of a pampered executive of a luxury hotel chain who constantly mistreats her personal assistant. After her plane trip is diverted by bad weather, the mean-spirited exec ends up at a cheap hotel in Detroit. She becomes tangled up with Russian sex traffickers, and it's up to her assistant, her security chief, and the FBI to save her.

The good news about Abducted is that it's actually shot fairly well by a first time director, with good lighting and color correction.  Which is a surprise considering this was a film by Asylum, responsible for such past gems as ""Snakes on a Train"", ""Transmorphers"", and ""Titanic II"" (I'm not making this up). Film veteran Lauren Holly does a decent job as the snarky executive, and most comments from women I've read seem to be excited by Joe Lando being cast as the exec's security chief.

The bad news about Abducted is that it isn't any different from most low-budget movies that go straight to DVD. The story isn't very memorable, most of the acting is average at best, and a great deal of what happens in the movie is laughably unrealistic (the clues about the abductor's hideout in particular).

As a Lifetime Network movie, Abducted is noticeably geared towards a woman audience, but I think guys like myself could still enjoy. Amazon doesn't list the rating, it's TV-14 for violence (no nudity, occasional b-word). Overall, it was shot better than I would expect, but it's still not remotely what you would expect to see in theaters. It's solidly average, yet worth watching once. Just don't expect a fast-paced or very memorable hostage flick.",1364947200,8,2024,4.735795454545454

5392729,4,B00A7OBIB4,"I watched this movie on television where it debuted as Layover. I thought it was a bit choppy in sections but it wasn't a total mess like some television movies can be. I mostly turned in because Joe Lando was in it. But I decided to purchase the DVD,even though the name was changed and the front cover picture has nothing to do with the plot.  I have to say I am glad I bought the DVD. The chopped out scenes were added back and it made the movie flow and more interesting to me. Things about the kidnapping and character attitudes in places were made to fit more easily.  And I was pleasantly surprised to see a new scene with Joe in it. The disc also has some bloopers and the making of for added fun.",1358294400,7,705,4.138686131386861

8547938,5,B00A7OBIB4,"Abducted (or Layover as it can also be found) follows the formula of most budget DVDs in that the cover image is not a scene in the movie and has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot.  Only one character gets abducted in this one and it's Lauren Holly's who is not the chick on the DVD cover.  Layover is actually a much better title, as the movie is about Suzanne Hollingsworth, a self absorbed Devil Wears Prada style boss (Holly) who inherited a luxury hotel chain and thinks the world is beneath her and everyone in it is there to serve her.  She mistreats, belittles and constantly fires her personal assistant, and blames everything that goes wrong, such as the private jet she had borrowed from some other rich dude  suddenly needing to be used by him because his father died so he can fly to the funeral on the assistant.  So Suzanne's forced to fly commercial and is furious that security is making her remove jewelry, that the flight attendant makes her stow her dog and get off her phone, and that the pilot is not diverting their plane to Chicago, which suits her better, than Detroit which she despises, during a severe weather event storm.  Her past behaviour has blacklisted her from every major hotel in Detroit, so she's forced to stay at a place that likely usually rents rooms by the hour where the guy on reception is behind bullet proof glass.  A woman being beaten by two men and obviously held against her will in the next room annoys her and her dog's precious solitude, with her loud screams for help and violent noisy fight for survival, so Suzanne bangs on the door to tell them off. The woman escapes while a too dumb to know what is going on Suzanne is pulled into the room to take her place.  Suzanne wakes up drugged in an abandoned hospital, there's some local bimbos in the room next door, who think they're contestants for a trip to Europe and a years modelling contract.  They aren't impressed with this old woman contestant who keeps trying to tell them there is no modelling contest and they are going to be sold to the highest Russian bidder. For an originally made for TV movie, this is one of the funniest movies you'll buy for a dollar or two. Not due to the jokes, sight gags, physical comedy or witty lines, but just by how unrealistic every character in the movie acts which is just hilarious.

This is easily Lauren Holly's most fun performance since Pickett Fences.",1528848000,,2413,4.513761467889908

Starring Lauren Holly and Kaylee DeFer, the movie is full of action and includes kidnapping, murder, female empowerment, and a happy ending. ... Movie Review: Abducted (2012)  Katarina Nolte

8547947,3,B00A7OBIB4,"This one had me scratching my head. It is an Asylum film, but didn't have the usual screw ups. It seemed like a Lifetime film then I found out this was a made for TV movie called ""Layover."" However using a picture of a pretty girl in a cage and calling it ""Abduction"" appeals to my perv factor, and that is what makes money.

Suzanne Hollingsworth (Lauren Holly) is a rich luxury hotel owner is forced to stay in Detroit, a city she loathes. She happens to be in a room next to the proverbial Russian sex traders who abduct her. Rebecca (Kaylee DeFer), Suzanne's thrice fired kickboxing assistant springs into action. Add a few more girls to the mix, water down the story for TV, apply the abduction formula and presto you have a mediocre film where Lauren Holly visibly struggles with the poorly written role.

Could we add a gay gut to this too? They are so in vogue. Maybe we could trash Detroit some more too. In a good way, it is better than most of Asylum films, but then that is not why we watch them.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Rated TV-14 for topical material. They could have at least had one of the girls in a cheerleader outfit. What did I do with my D.E.B.S. DVD?",1369008000,6,1194,4.321428571428571
