8461185,1,B0057YCQWO,Very dated! Did not hold daughters attention at all. She is used to taking yoga classes.,1457049600,,88,4.5625
8461186,2,B0057YCQWO,VERY amateur production. my kids can't stand this video even though the content itself is fine. The production value is just abysmal.,1362873600,,133,5.090909090909091
8461187,5,B0057YCQWO,"This is the most awesome kids yoga video I've seen. Being a kids fitness coach and Yogafit kids instructor this has help  me incorporate  fun into my routines. Stephanie Adams makes the yoga games, poses and each hill that is climed into a game that is fun and the kids enjoy doing.",1277510400,3,282,4.403846153846154
8461188,5,B0057YCQWO,I was watching my grandson of five years doing the routine with the children on the disc when his two year old sister joined in on the action.  Nothing in this is too hard and the children can do it alone with the children on the disc.  Great deal,1264896000,5,247,4.020408163265306
8461189,5,B0057YCQWO,"I have never had any experience with kids yoga before, so this was a great introductory dvd.  Hearing the language of how she interacted with kids was very helpful.",1241308800,5,164,4.655172413793103
