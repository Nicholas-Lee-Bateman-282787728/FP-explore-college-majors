8162564,1,B000LP4Z50,"I purchased this dvd as I'm trying to gain a vast knowledge of the arts, especially international arts. There are very, very few traditional Oriental arts dvd's available with English subtitles and I thought I had found one and was almost overjoyed. But to my huge disappointment, I played the dvd only to find that there are no English subtitles. What I don't understand is why the information on the box is given in English as well as Chinese and there is no mention in the advertisement that there are no English subtitles and you don't find out that there are no subtitles until after you've purchased it. I found the seller (it wasn't Amazon.com themselves) to be of no help. What I finally did was pack it up and mail it to a Chinese couple that I happen to know and I wished them luck. I do not find Amazon.com to blame for such things but I have had experiences such as this with other sellers and I resent it when products are under-advertised and critical info is left out. I don't like having to guess at what's going to arrive. Again, this video is only for those who can understand it in Chinese.",1377993600,3,1109,4.414634146341464
