8758700,5,B01EGQABBG,"Product wise: Acceptable. A little worn on the edges, but not more than what you would expect even if you bought the movie in a store. Nothing worthy of taking away a star.

Movie wise: This is a favorite! My wife and I watched this while we were dating and still love it today. I had a copy of it but lost it so we had to go out and order a new one. In my top five movies of all time, this is either number one or two (""Singing in the Rain"" is a hard movie to beat). Excellent movie for date night or just a good movie night.",1521331200,,526,3.7818181818181817
