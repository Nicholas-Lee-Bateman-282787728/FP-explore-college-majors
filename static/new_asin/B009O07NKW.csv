5358180,1,B009O07NKW,"I wanted a paper copy of a book not a DVD book.
We enjoy reading a book to our child - not having her sit in front of a computer!",1372204800,,129,3.3333333333333335
5358181,5,B009O07NKW,"My granddaughters and I watched and laughed at the wit, the excentricity of the teacher,  the magical transformations the bus makes, and they learned some things they would not otherwise have come across.
The children are well defined, the colors are bright, the whole story stimulating.
They are still at an age when they can watch a movie a hundred times and not get tired of it. In fact,
they discover new things to enjoy each time, until they know some passages by heart!
A welcome gift for any child, even if that child is too young to read.",1372204800,4,546,4.515151515151516

5358185,5,B009O07NKW,"We own several (ok, like six) magic school bus DVDs, and my son likes all of them so far. He is 6 years old and it's extremely difficult to make him sit still- he gets bored quickly- and he actually watches these videos from beginning to end (and is learning in the process). I wish I had just bought the package deal to start with because all the videos are good.",1369612800,2,364,4.140845070422535
