8758022,3,B01E7ZORYS,"I agree with what other reviewers have indicated: a ridiculous staging, changing the story and the characters, and losing in the process a lot of the magic and charm that the story has to offer. That is why this version cannot be considered as a success.
But I do not want to dwell on the negative, and there are huge positives in this production.
One is Thielemann's direction, bordering perfection. In my opinion it is far from his 2003 DGG recording, vastly improved, bringing a lot of depth and understanding of the score. The pace and the colours are artfully defined through a Bayreuth Festival Orchestra that sounds absolutely stunning. One of the finest renditions I have ever heard.
The other positive note is one that will get systematically discarded because of the silly excesses of Katherina Wagner, and it is Georg Zeppenfeld rendition of King Marke. Just so you know, in this version King Marke is a bad guy, he imprisons and tortures both Tristan and Isolde in the second act, and he takes violently away Isolde just after the Liebestod; but follow my advice, close your eyes during the second act monolog and listen. The nobility and beauty of the voice cannot be hidden, and the singing of Mr Zeppenfeld is stunning, with a beautiful and nuanced tone that borders perfection.
I am not a fan of Stephen Gould, but I accept he delivers a solid performance with some hiccups here and there. A similar comment can be made for Evelyn Herlitzius, but in my opinion she raises her standard significantly for the Liebestod, which is beautifully rendered.
I like a lot Christa Mayer, I think she delivers an excellent Brangane (particularly in the second act), and I do not like Iain Paterson, that gives in my opinion a bland rendition of Kurwenal.",1473638400,3,1758,4.767213114754099
8758023,1,B01E7ZORYS,"First of all the mise-en-scne is absurd, meaningless. In Act I, for example, Isolde says: ""Herr Tristan trete nah '."" (Mr Tristan, come in) For what? He is on the scene with her all the time. The attempt of King Marke to force Isolde to perform oral sex at the end of the second act is a complete lack of common sense. Evelyn Herlitzius sings well when hatefully but gross to sing the lyrical passages. Stephen Gould is out of tune all the time, and in the third act screams like a madman. The end of the Liebestod with King Marke leading Isolde though grossly conflicts with the soft music that Wagner wrote. The only good thing is the musical direction of Christian Thielemann and the magnificent orchestra. Another eurotrash from Bayreuth. Poor Wagner",1471651200,4,754,4.634328358208955
8758024,3,B01E7ZORYS,"Execrable staging which often has got nothing to do with the spirit of the opera and is an exercise in futility and, probably, fulfils the self-centred ego of Katharina Wagner who is of course in the position to have her antics accepted by the many who parade in Bayreuth during the summer months.
I am just sorry for Christian Thielemann to be drawn into this mess.
Still, remains his remarkable direction and the great singing of Evelyn Herlitzius.",1471305600,5,450,4.782051282051282
8758025,3,B01E7ZORYS,"In my view there are two things terribly wrong with this disk.  First, Katharina Wagner's production is, predictably, heavy with symbolism (gratuitous blood, steel bars during the love music),and light on anything suggesting time or place (the first act set is a land-bound jungle gym).  Evidently Ms. Wagner thinks that, without such distractions, the audience will become bored with nothing but her great grand-father's music to engage the mind.  Second, Evelyn Herlitzius is an inadequate Isolde, lacking power and having a tremulous voice that becomes close to a shout on many high notes.  These are of course most serious detriments, and it is questionable whether they are off-set by the performance's undoubted  merits.  High among these is the strong conducting of Christian Thielemann, the playing of marvelous Bayreuth orchestra, the famous Bayreuth acoustics, the splendid Tristan of Stephen Gould, and the generally fine supporting singers, all well captured by Deutsche Grammophon's cameras and microphones.  DGG has announced a multi-year partnership with the Bayreuth Festival under which it will issue DVD/blu-ray versions of most or all of the Festival's new productions.  One can only hope that it, and the Festival, will choose these productions with critical care, especially in the matter of casting",1468454400,4,1320,5.5
