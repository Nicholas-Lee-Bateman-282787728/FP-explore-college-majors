8027301,5,B0002EJ7LC,I have waited so long to see this movie again on TV and it has not been on in so long. I was so thrilled to be able to buy it and now I can watch it every day. One thing is that ...  they left out about 30 - 45 min of the original movie and that is sad. I do not know why they did this. This movie is a long one but I love it and sad to not get to see the parts that were cut out. i hope that one day they will make another one with the whole movie.,1308960000,,449,3.276190476190476
