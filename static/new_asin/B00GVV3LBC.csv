8627889,4,B00GVV3LBC,"I recently purchased this skin & it is baby/sky blue, like the first reviewer mentioned. Although the case is not the same color, it still is silicone and provides a nice comfortable grip for the controller. I haven't had to worry about sweaty palms yet, but im also not playing 8 hours of the day. For 3 or so bucks, its definitely not worth the effort to ship back, or even really bad mad.. just beware the color change if interested.",1481068800,,436,4.395061728395062

8627896,5,B00GVV3LBC,"Work great, feels great, looks great, improves controller feel and doesn't sweat my hands.  Note: If you have a Sony PS4 controller charging dock, you will have to trim it slightly to get it to seat properly in the charger. I used a short curved pair of hobby scissors to do it.  Works great.",1388620800,,292,4.388888888888889
