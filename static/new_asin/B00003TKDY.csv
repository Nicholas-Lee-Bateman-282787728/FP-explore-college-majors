1332895,3,B00003TKDY,It isn't Pierce Brosnan's best movie but it gets the job done. It has a good plot and gives a decent twist at the end that leaves you satisfied that the good guys still win!,1202342400,6,173,3.9714285714285715
1332896,4,B00003TKDY,"This is a very clever, enjoyable movie.  Pierce Brosnan is good, as usual. It is a well done who-dun-it.  I will watch it over and over.",1181347200,,136,4.1923076923076925
1332897,5,B00003TKDY,"MURDER 101 written and directed by Bill Condon (who would later grab an Oscar for GODS AND MONSTERS) is a great little movie that I had never heard of.  Suffice to say, Condon's neat little script gives us two big surprises at the end.  The murderer is hard to spot and the ending is just ""Wow, did I just see what I think I saw?""
At any rate, Pierce Brosnan in his pre Bond days stars as a best-selling crime writer who teaches a class in how to write the perfect crime novel.  Brosnan gained famed writing a true crime thriller that sent his friend to prison for murdering his wife.  Brosnan returns to teaching, to meet his estranged wife, played sweetly by Dey Young, who has taken up with another professor, played smarmily by Mark L. Taylor (Fangs).  Another friend of his is Detective Mike Dowley (played with a surly masculinity by Antoni Carone).  Soon, though, things take a demonic twist when Pierce is set up for murder by one of his students.  Rachel Sbarge in a crafty performance seems to be the one who is setting him up.
The pace is good; the script witty and inventive; and overall, a tidy, surprising mystery.",1073347200,49,1128,4.4731707317073175
1332898,4,B00003TKDY,With another actor I may have given this 3 stars for me... as in a good little mystery.  With brosnan in it i give 4 stars.,1055894400,5,123,3.730769230769231
1332899,4,B00003TKDY,"This DVD was purchase for entertainment, plus you can't beat the price.  I was very pleasently surprised with the film, Pierce Brosnan's performance was exceptional.  If you are a Movie buff this is a must see.",1010016000,10,210,4.805555555555555
1332900,5,B00003TKDY,"finally a very good thriller with very famous actors. Brosnan of course much better than as our beloved 007 is just great in this movie. How he uses his knowledge to write a thriller and uses it on the real murder is  fascinating and very enjoyable. If you in the mood for a great thriller  DON'T MISS ""MURDER 101""",961545600,17,314,4.305084745762712
1332901,4,B00003TKDY,"I really enjoyed this 1991 t.v thriller starring Pierce Brosnan, before  stepping into the role of suave secret agent James Bond, Brosnan was  College professior Charles Lattimore returning back after a leave of  absence due to writing his novel. No sooner when he gets back he tries to  ignite his relationship with his ex-wife but she is with someone else. As  well he's back into teaching. His first assigment he has for his students  is to plan the perfect murder, no sooner one of his students is murdered  and he comes under fire from the local autothies. Be prepared for the  surpirse ending is nothing you would expect. This film does examine that  even people of high moral integrity can still fall for the usual mind games  inoving love and passion. Pierce Brosnan in this role has all the  crediabillty and durabilty for the viewer to sustain beief. It is indeed a  well made film.",960508800,21,892,4.683870967741935
1332902,5,B00003TKDY,"Murder 101 is an awesome suspense film mixed in with some aspects of comedy, drama, and romance. Pierce is an awesome actor as any sensible female knows, and he certainly put in enormous efforts in this film. It's a  great movie that keeps you in suspense with wee twists and turns along the  way, then comes out with a great surprise ending. Marvelous film for any  movie buff.",955843200,3,378,4.529411764705882
1332903,5,B00003TKDY,"I have this one in my video also.  I purchased this one about the same time I purchased ""Goldeneye.""
I loved this character.  It was a completely drama based character.
You feel sorry for him that his wife,  Laura has decided to take up with a creep like Henry.
Henry is the exact  opposite of Charles.  Henry only thinks about Henry.  He does lack a soul.  Eventually, Laura comes to realize that her heart truly belongs with  Charles.
It's great the plot twists and turns, because in the end the  killer is the person you least expect it to be, Mike Dowling.
The  character of Charles is romantic, sexy, but minus the Remington Steele  dress.
His relationship with Laura is very interesting the way it is  portrayed.  She thinks she no longer cares about Charles, but she really  does.
He was great as a teacher.",928454400,5,814,4.524137931034483
1333018,2,B00003TKDY,"Very 1980s TV-movie quality of writing and acting. While it does have some twists and turns, overall it has the feel of a movie made so everyone could take home a paycheck and add a flick to their resumes that isn't awful, but isn't worth remembering, either.",1477353600,,259,4.531914893617022

1333122,2,B00003TKDY,Another poor Pierce Brosnan effort.  I just found this annoying and got bored about half-way through.  Figured out the real murderer pretty quickly and the over-acting on Pierce's part really got to me.  Not my cup of tea.,1344902400,,222,4.7894736842105265
1333123,4,B00003TKDY,One more great performance for Pierce Brosnan.  Pierce is at his best when he plays complicated characters.  Well worth an addition to your movie collection.,1331769600,,157,5.24
1333124,5,B00003TKDY,This is one of those movies I like to pop in the DVD and watch from time to time on a cold afternoon when I want to be entertained but not confronted by the story line. It is a well constructed murder mystery with the usual twists and turns. A bit corny in places but that's OK. The cast is great and Pierce Bronsnan is the flawed hero who saves the day in the end.,1300320000,,365,3.88

1333126,3,B00003TKDY,I would have to agree with the review of the person who said it was 'weak' but got the job done.  It's what our family terms a 'mindless' movie .. something that is fun to watch without having to invest a lot of thought.,1257811200,,220,4.0
1333127,5,B00003TKDY,"We are die hard fans of Pierce Brendan Brosnan, Irish born actor who is one of our favorite James Bonds. We have been collecting his movies and Murder 101 is an excellent thriller, murder mystery.

Pierce Brosnan plays the part of a recently separated from his wife English professor by the name of Charles Lattimore who teaches students how to write, but encourages them to develop characters involved in crime and challenges these young aspiring authors to write about how to do the perfect murder.

Charles Lattimore has returned to teaching because he still loves his wife who now dates a professor at the same school. Thanks to his teaching job, he has access to her as he tries to mend the relationship.

We know that the professor has written a best selling book about a real case that ended up sending a friend to prison for killing his wife. Some of the students are brilliant and they take this professor head on to plan a murder in such a way that the investigating officers are unable to solve it. One female student attempts to date the professor and the plot thickens for she is murdered and now the professor is involved in the plot.

To give other details would detract from the thrill of following this fast paced mystery but you will enjoy it because it is well written and masterfully executed. Don't miss it!",1240012800,7,1328,4.614406779661017
1333128,3,B00003TKDY,"This was a moderately entertaining film, but with a limited cast of suspects, the resolution wasn't too much of a shock.  The premise is pretty interesting: how does an expert crime writer (and college professor) deal with being involved in the Hitchcockian nightmare of being falsely accused of murder and investigating on his own to protect himself?  Add in the complication of a previous ""unrelated"" murder and the fun starts.  Brosnan is pretty good as the hapless professor.  Never a great actor, he certainly added life to the role and kept the momentum going.",1220832000,8,566,4.98936170212766
