5740216,5,B00CTUIXMG,"This was my 5th pregnancy. I worked out after having the baby, but never threw a pregnancy. I always gave up in the 1st trimester because I got tired and lazy. I would end up gaining 40 pounds and have 10 to 11 pound babys. I decided to work out this pregnancy and to eat a healthier diet to see if it would help with my wight gain and the size of my baby. I was excited to find Lindsay Brins new pregnancy DVDs because I use her DVDs regularly after I have a baby. I did it and was very consistent with her 1st,2nd, and 3rd trimester DVDs. I really enjoyed them. It was one of the best choices I ever made for my baby and I. I had so many good results from working out with her DVDs. I think its funny because I still gained 40 pounds and my son ended up being 10 pounds 1 oz. But I felt wonderful, had a sense of well being I never had with my other pregnancy's and had a super short 3 hour labor. I feel good postpartum too. I'm going to always work out during pregnancy now and use her DVDs. I highly recommend this DVD set!",1388966400,,1028,3.923444976076555
5740217,4,B00CTUIXMG,My wife had already bought Lindsay's first pregnancy DVD and loved it. So I gave her this one for her birthday and she loves it !,1387152000,,129,4.0
5740218,5,B00CTUIXMG,"I purchased this product from Lindsay's website directly.

I have been using these DVDs for almost seven months and love them! I ordered them during my first trimester, but continued with my normal exercises until they became a bit too difficult. Then, I switched to Lindsay's first trimester DVD. At first, it was a bit easy; however, she gives you so many ways to modify to increase (or decrease) your intensity that I was still getting a good workout. Plus, with how most of us feel during the first trimester, it's nice to have a video that we can modify for those horrible days when we feel like zombies.

As my pregnancy has progressed, I find the DVDs more and more challenging. The only DVD I have not yet used is the Bonus DVD as my son isn't due for about a month. I'm sure it will be great, though, as all of the trimester DVDs were extraordinarily well thought out. I also own Lindsay's Pretty Fierce Weight Loss set (which I had started about a week before I realized I was pregnant) and I loved every minute of it (so far). Lindsay seems to understand the ""mommy body"" much better than anyone else out there, and I have tried a lot of different workouts. Plus, she does her research and provides plenty of tips to make certain of your safety (and the baby's in her pregnancy DVDs).

Currently, I am at the end of my third pregnancy. With my previous two pregnancies, I gained almost 70 pounds each time. I have less than a month to go and am at 30 pounds total. The only thing I've done differently is Lindsay's DVDs, so it's all due to her expertise. Additionally, I still have ab muscles in month nine thanks to her focus on the core during the pregnancy workouts. I still am not having a problem picking up my children at 45 and 38 pounds which is insane to me! I can't wait to go through labor this time as I know it will be much easier with actual ab muscles there to help me. Plus, day-to-day has been much easier due to exercise. I've also had no issue with retaining water this time around which is nice.

I highly recommend these DVDs to anyone who wants a diverse workout (you never complete the same routine two days in a row) and a much healthier pregnancy overall. Thank you, Lindsay!!!

********UPDATE*********
I had my baby a couple of weeks ago, and I'm happy to announce that I had no interventions even though he was 10 lbs. 3 ozs. with a 15 1/2 inch head! It only took 20 minutes of pushing as well, and I attribute that fact to the ab work I did with these DVDs throughout the pregnancy. Also, I appreciate all of the aerobic conditioning I did throughout the pregnancy as labor was about 27 hours (he had to turn around as he was posterior to begin with). I was pretty tired when I started pushing at 2:30 AM, but we all made it. I ended at 35 pounds of weight gain. Exercising with Lindsay made all the difference!",1386115200,33,2850,4.3395872420262664
5740219,3,B00CTUIXMG,"I love Lindsay's other workouts, so I was excited to get these.  I've only started the 1st trimester DVDs, but so far they're pretty repetitive and boring.  The aerobics routine is on a loop, and the workouts are so short that I barely break a sweat.",1381017600,,250,4.413043478260869
5740220,4,B00CTUIXMG,"I'm really enjoying this program so far.  I've been using different Beachbody programs to stay fit at home for several years.  Upon getting pregnant, I wanted to continue to stay fit and active but with a program that would be safe throughout pregnancy.  This series provides that with a different set of workouts for each trimester.  Cardio days alternate with strength training days for 5 workouts and 2 rest days per week.  Lindsay is very knowledgeable re: maintaining safety while working out during pregnancy.  My one complaint is that the workouts are short, even those labeled ""advanced"", none longer than 1/2 hour.  But I simply add my own from the other programs I own or add a walk, with my goal being about an hour of physical activity 5-6 days per week.  I recommend this program to anyone wanting to maintain their fitness during pregnancy.",1374710400,12,854,4.841379310344828
5740221,5,B00CTUIXMG,"I'm pregnant with #2 and have been working out to Lindsay Brin's DVDs since my first pregnancy. She helped me get super fit in between pregnancies, too. I love these workouts, and they keep me fit so at the end of the pregnancy when the baby comes, it's easy to lose the baby weight. She keeps you motivated, and my goodness she got my diastisis recti stomach back to normal in no time. And I even managed to get a defined abs in after baby #1. This, from someone (me) who hated sit ups. She makes working out DOABLE. We're all busy moms, with very little time, and she gets it all in in short workouts. I went on to Boot Camp 6 weeks after the baby and eventually I did the Pretty Fierce DVD. I felt great. And now with baby #2 doing Lindsay Brin's  pregnancy DVDs, I feel the benefits (I have a tidy bump), and am totally unconcerned about getting my pre-baby body back because I know Lindsay Brin will help me get there. And I'll have fun doing it.

Oh plus you get loads of info through email...nutrition, pregnancy weight, and if you join her Facebook and Pinterest pages she shares even more stuff. She clearly loves what she does and is passionate about helping moms get fit and feel great.",1442448000,,1197,4.315555555555555
5740222,5,B00CTUIXMG,"Perfect! Challenging, but focused on safety for mom and baby. Will get her postnatal DVD, as well.",1440028800,,98,4.823529411764706
5740223,3,B00CTUIXMG,"Exercises are repetitive so they get pretty boring, pretty quickly.",1439078400,,67,5.8
5740224,3,B00CTUIXMG,"I purchased this DVD based on reviews that stated this was great for women who were already working out.  I was doing fitnesblender before this, incorporating hiit, weight lifting (18lbs on bicep curls for example), barre, pilates, cardio, kickboxing.  Never bored, lots of variety.  Many pre-natal workouts I found seemed way too beginner-ish so figured I'd try this one.  It (looked like it) had tons of workouts with a very good price.  In general, I liked it.  I did.  I'm glad I bought it.  But in short it gave me just three different easy workouts to use.  Not what I thought. There were some fatal cons to this series of DVDs. Let's start off positive though.

Pros:
The workouts were pretty good and basic moves, yet she doesn't take forever to explain a simple squat like some other videos.
The workouts are easy to split up if you just want to tone, or do cardio, or just yoga.
The price is really competitive compared to other pre-natal DVDs (note, there are plenty of free ones on youtube though!)
The cardio portion wasn't bad. It was pretty fast paced and in 45 on 15 off format.

Cons:
You do not get nearly as many workouts as you think.  I thought moderate vs advanced would be a fun way to have different workouts - NOPE!  The advanced is simply the moderate repeated twice!  And I mean, it just played it again so she wasn't even saying different things.  It was just a loop.  The toning yoga blend and yoga and flexibility are the same for all DVDs with demonstrations throughout for each trimester.
The workouts are short and I think there could be much more toning moves.
It is very low on toning, but there are ""stackers.""  She states to not add these to toning workout, but on different day.  I disagree, the toning is quite easy and the stackers would actually make it a decent full workout.
The cool down is actually on your own.  She instructs to walk around the house 3 minutes then do the short stretches.  This defies the purpose of a workout DVD - to follow along all the way through easily.
The stackers are also not put into the videos, its more instruction type so you'd have to do them on your own.  She doesn't even do a full set of each.  Again, to me defies purpose of a workout DVD.
The warm ups are the same per trimester.  So though there's a different warmup for each trimester, they are similar and the same for that whole trimester.
It was hard to download the calendar; it was hard to find even with the link.
Video needed lots of edits, and could have been setup better.  It looks low to mid budget, but the actual content is still good and well filmed.
The pregnant lady wore a weird top.  Didn't look supportive at all, it was backless with a couple thin straps across.  Not a huge con, but was just weird when she had just said in her rules to wear supportive bra and footwear.

In short, I cannot imagine doing the same exact workout for a whole trimester at a time.  This will just be in rotation for a day an easy workout.",1438905600,10,2975,4.3893967093235835
5740225,5,B00CTUIXMG,I have only used the first trimester video so far. Finally a prenatal workout that made me sweat! It is a great workout video. I completed one of Lindsey Brin's other prenatal series with my first pregnancy and loved it too but this one seems to be more hard-core. I am doing the advanced version. I absolutely love it!,1437177600,,319,4.423728813559322
5740226,5,B00CTUIXMG,"This DVD kept me fit throughout my pregnancy. I felt great, had energy and all of the exercises were safe for each trimester. A definite must have. Her post pregnancy DVD is excellent too!",1435104000,,188,4.5588235294117645
5740227,5,B00CTUIXMG,"I've been using these DVDs for my most recent pregnancy and I love them! I love feeling like I'm keeping my body healthy, while also staying safe throughout my pregnancy. The workouts can feel pretty repetitive, especially when segments just repeat instead of filming the exercises twice, but I don't really care. The point is I'm staying healthy and fit without leaving the comforts of my home. I'm a big fan of the trimester specific exercises and that I can use moderate or advanced exercises, depending on my general fitness level. I'd recommend these workouts for any of my pregnant friends.",1433721600,,596,4.910891089108911
5740228,5,B00CTUIXMG,"I love this DVD set! It has toning, cardio and yoga for every trimester of pregnancy! I own about 5 different prenatal DVD's and this's is the only one I use!",1432598400,,158,4.129032258064516
5740229,1,B00CTUIXMG,"I am only currently using the first trimester DVD, as that's how far along I am. The DVD so far is redundant. For example, I selected the 25 minute cardio block, thinking it would be 25 minutes of different moves, but it's just Lindsay doing moves for 12 minutes and then that exact same footage loops for another 12 minutes. Her version of a cool down is to have you pause the DVD player and walk around for 3 minutes. I could do that without having spent $25 on this workout. The cool down continues with her doing stretches for 2 minutes, then closing by saying ""As always, you can do a lot more stretching. It is totally up to you."" To me, that is just a cop out.

Prior to pregnancy I was exercising 3-4 times a week: cardio, bicycling and strength training. I had been following this regimen for two years, and consider myself to be fairly fit; but not at all on the level of an advanced athlete. That being said, I do not find the moves in the first trimester DVD to be challenging; even on the advanced level. The moves in this DVD are sometimes awkward and clunky. I'm not willing to give up on this series yet. I will attempt to use the 2nd and 3rd trimester DVDs. Perhaps those will be more challenging? After I finish one of Lindsay's workouts, I don't have that sense of accomplishment that one often gets from exercising; instead I am just annoyed.

Every time you start the video, you are forced to watch a 1 minute and 30 second disclaimer. In the different workouts, Lindsay's dialogue is overly repetitive; it's as though she recorded these sessions thinking you would only ever watch it once. By the tenth time you do the workouts, it's irritating to listen to her say the same things over and over again ""The baby is getting bigger; You should be able to talk during your workouts; Are you still talking? etc."" I have other prenatal workouts and they manage to convey the same concerns and information about safety while pregnant and exercising without being as bothersome as Lindsay.

Production value: looks as though it was produced on a very low budget. The exercise sessions are just Lindsay, and sometimes a pregnant companion, exercising in a windowless gray room. Cheesy music plays in the background. Sometimes you are just listening to Lindsay breathe. Overall this video looks like it was produced in the early 90's despite the back of the case saying copyright 2013.",1432512000,2,2398,4.572093023255814
5740230,5,B00CTUIXMG,The most challenging of the pregnancy workouts I've tried. I feel like I'm keeping my muscle strength without overtaxing myself.,1427673600,,128,5.45
5740231,5,B00CTUIXMG,"This is exactly what I was looking for!!!! I am a fairly fit pregnant woman. I have been regularly working out in group exercise classes for more than a year. Weight lifting, Body Shred, core, Spin or yoga classes. I am now going into my third trimester and am feeling a little limited with what I can do for cardio (besides an elliptical or treadmill at the gym) as well as safe core workouts. I was also wanting a workout that I could do at home for those extra busy weeks when I don't get to the gym as often as I'd like. I was frustrated with the choice of pregnancy fitness dvd's as they were either not challenging enough or else the cardio was too many dance type moves that had me more frustrated and not sweating enough. I'm used to doing Jillian Michael's dvd's where you do something for 30 seconds to get your heart rate up.

I did the 3rd trimester advanced workouts and I like that I have all those options. I was sweating and yet my heart rate wasn't sky high. For some of the moves I added some light hand weights to challenge myself a bit and it worked totally fine.

Lindsay had good explanations and modifications and the moves were challenging but not frustrating to do.

 I really, really, really recommend this for active pregnant women that want to continue to feel like they are getting a good workout.",1426377600,,1326,4.378048780487805
5740232,5,B00CTUIXMG,"What a huge bang for your buck! This workout set is awesome. It is everything you need to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy. Lindsay Brin knows her stuff for prenatal workouts. I am currently in my second trimester and I am feeling so much better than previous pregnancies. Plus, my weight gain is staying in the recommended range, which I didn't do in previous pregnancies when I wasn't working out as much.  Before becoming pregnant I was working out with P90X3 and Jillian Michaels Body Revolution. These workouts are a little on the easy side compared to what I was doing before, but I still get my heart rate up and finish feeling energized. She shows lots of ways to modify the workouts to fit your fitness level, so thus set is totally appropriate for beginners to advanced exercisers The set includes upper body, lower body, cardio and core workouts for each trimester, plus two yoga workouts that are appropriate for the whole pregnancy.  I really enjoy each workout.  I suffered from diastasis recti in the past and I love that she addresses this common condition in her workouts. I love that she has included some basic core recovery movements you can do in those first 6 weeks postpartum. I am excited to try her post pregnancy slim down after baby arrives!",1424131200,,1273,4.699551569506727
5740233,5,B00CTUIXMG,"I did Lindsay's MIF Pretty Fierce Lean Out series when I was about 10 months postpartum with my 2nd child.  I had a tiny pooch that I could not get rid of even though I was below my pre-pregnancy weight.  Those workouts kicked my trash, but were amazing and I finally saw the results I wanted! So, now I'm pregnant with my 3rd and wanted to do more of her workouts.  I'm 17 wks along and have been doing these workouts and they're great!  Not too difficult for a pregnant person, but they are still a great workout and I love the fact that I'm still incorporating weights and core into my workouts.  I love Lindsay and her DVDs!

5740236,2,B00CTUIXMG,These workouts didn't work out for me. It didn't keep my attention and the moves are awkward.

My first two boys were born premature and so I was a little hesitant to work out through out this whole pregnancy but I am so glad I did. Not only was this baby full term but I am already back in normal pants (not my pre-pregnancy size but close) and only 6lbs away from my pre-pregnancy weight.

I have found a lack of guidance in the area of in prenatal workouts -- some are so tame, you don't even break a sweat, and if you've been working out consistently before you became pregnant, you really miss getting sweaty!  When I have a lot of energy, I do two segments; when I don't have a lot of energy, I do one and still feel so much better than before I worked out.  In addition, the segments are just the right length to fit into a busy schedule -- even if you just want to sit down with ice cream on the couch, you can almost always find the motivation to do 17 minutes of yoga or 25 minutes of strength training.  And if you want to bust out a super motivated 40 minutes, you can do that, too!  When one trimester gets too difficult to keep up with, just switch to the next.

5740243,5,B00CTUIXMG,"Background on me: I would consider myself a high-intermediate level exerciser. Before this pregnancy, I was working out 5 days a week for 30-40 minutes each session.

I've only tried the 1st and 2nd trimester workouts so far because I'm only in my 2nd trimester. So far, I really like these workouts, and I would imagine the same would be true for the 3rd trimester as well. Lindsay is upbeat an encouraging in these workouts. She provides helpful modifications and general information on exercising during pregnancy as well. You also get a workout calendar that creates a workout schedule for you for each day.  I like having the option to do either the Moderate workouts when I don't have as much energy or am not feeling so well or to do the Advanced workouts when I have a lot of energy.

From what I have seen so far, the Moderate version of the cardio and strength workouts contains one set of each exercise, and the Advanced versions of the cardio and strength workouts contain two sets.  So in the cardio workout, for example, the Moderate version goes through all the drills once. In the Advanced version, you go through all of the drills once, and then you repeat all of the drills again.

The yoga relaxation and stretch workouts are the same for all the trimesters (Lindsay tells you this during the workout), but you are given trimester-specific modifications for each pose. I have only done the yoga toning workout from the second trimester, so I am not sure if it's the same for all trimesters. I thought the yoga was fine for a change of pace, but I prefer more traditional yoga workouts, so I am not sure how much more I'll use them.

I think the workouts are great for pregnancy, and I like that there are trimester specific sets of workouts. I can even see using these workouts, particularly the first trimester and second trimester sets, during the early postpartum phase when you are ramping up in intensity to your exercise level pre-pregnancy.

Overall, this set has quite a lot of variety, and it's a great value.",1390262400,5,2037,4.641666666666667

The only downside is that the stackers are the same this trimester as the first so I am getting a little bored of them. Some of the other workouts did change though. With a toddler that takes short naps, these are perfect to fit in. Lindsay has done so much research, I trust her to have safe workouts.",1390262400,3,567,4.2592592592592595
5740245,4,B00CTUIXMG,I think these are good workout DVDs for pregnancy. I did not follow the pregnancy schedule and instead just did the cardio and yoga a few times a week (I do not rely on this for my only form of exercise). The workouts have been good through my pregnancy (I am currently 33 weeks and have been using them since early in my pregnancy).

The calendar is easy to follow and she has routines for advanced and moderate levels. She has days for upper or lower strength, cardio and yoga.

The warm up and cool down are the same exact clip for every one of the workouts, and they take up 8-9 minutes of the total workout time (which is only somewhere between 20-27 minutes).
If you are a beginner and like routines that will be easy to follow and do - this will be fine for you. But if you want a little more variety and challenge, I'd skip this one.",1465344000,,692,4.25
