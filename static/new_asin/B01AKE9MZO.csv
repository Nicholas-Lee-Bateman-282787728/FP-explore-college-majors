7606129,3,B01AKE9MZO,"Ava was possessed for 28 days by the demon Naphula, but she's better now. Everywhere she goes, people hate her, fear her, or mock her. Not only did she lose her job, but also her boyfriend and all of her friends. She's being faced with numerous criminal charges and opts to join a rehabilitation program for possessed people instead of going to jail or paying back all the damage she caused. Ava starts on her journey trying to piece together the last 28 days, figure out why she became possessed, and see why her floor is stained with blood.

I'm not usually a fan of possession stories, but this one is unique in that it takes place right after the possession where most films end. Considering how possessions usually go (attacking people, acting grotesquely sexual, yelling obscenities, among other horrific things), it's safe to assume that the transition back to normal life isn't going to be easy. Ava has no memory of any of the things she's told she did, but her entire world has changed. Everyone looks at her like she's dangerous and so many people have been hurt by Naphula with her face. She has practically no support system left except a court appointed counselor, a lawyer, and her horribly judgmental mother. Everyone else either hates her, fears her, or mocks her and nothing she does can change the damage that's been done. Along with the emotional fallout, Naphula wreaked havoc and racked up quite the list of criminal charges as well. Now, she has to go to what amounts to Possession Anonymous or face the full brunt of crimes she didn't commit.

The film loses a lot of steam near the end with completely predictable revelations and simply underwhelming events. Ava also insisted on making horrible decisions that wouldn't even help her. I liked that the story explored people who like being possessed and even work with their demons as a different perspective not seen in possession stories. The ending was unimpressive and clumsy, but the majority of the film is enjoyable and a different fare than the usual in the genre.",1465257600,,2046,4.76056338028169
7606130,3,B01AKE9MZO,"Odd horror comedy about a woman dealing with the aftermath of being possessed is one of those unfortunate neither this nor that films in that it isn't particularly creepy or funny, but rather a smidgeon of each and a lot of screen time that never really comes close to qualifying as either.  It's a shame, actually, because Ava's Possessions shows signs that it could have been effective as a relatively straight horror movie or as a zany comedy, but it ends up working as neither.

After Ava is exorcised she doesn't remember anything that happened while she was possessed but finds her life irrevocably changed.  Her boyfriend has broken up with her.  Ava's friends stay far away.  She no longer has a job.  She's facing criminal charges for things she has no memory doing.  One of the few decent gags has her lawyer show her an under the  demon influence surveillance video where she floats behind a man at an ATM and attacks him while her lawyer explains the list of charges against her which include two counts of possession...of narcotics.  To avoid jail time Ava is forced to join a sort of AA group for the formerly spirit inhabited and she tries to piece together the mystery of what she did when she was possessed and lost an entire month of her life.

So far so good.  The problem is that Ava's Possessions never tries very hard to be scary or funny--it seems instead to be going for some sort of quirky indie film fest quality, like something you would expect to play Sundance...but with demon possession.  I suspect that some people will find it easier to get on this movie's wavelength than I did--the tone and material should certainly appeal to people who are into dramedies about aimless twentysomethings trying to navigate a path in life.  Unfortunately, I'm not at all into those films and kept finding myself wishing Ava's Possessions was trying to be scary or funny rather than quirky and charming.",1463875200,,1919,4.692537313432836
7606131,4,B01AKE9MZO,"MY CALL:  A fine possession-themed horror comedy with enough good qualities to interest me in what the director does next.  Featuring a great premise but shaky writing, it's a nice little indie that explores legal consequences and support groups aimed at possession victims.

REVIEW...

Meet Ava (Louisa Krause; The Abandoned, The Babysitters).  Ava has just been exorcised and awakens to the harsh reality that often goes completely unaddressed in horror movies on the topic: so what happens now?  You were possessed, the spirit has been banished, but you did some things and the real world packs consequences for our actions.

There's a most welcome dark dryness to the humor in this exorcism/possession satire and these scenes are truly precious when you think about it.  Her mother (Deborah Rush; Orange is the New Black, The Box) and father (William Sadler; Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, Bordello of Blood, episode The Man Who was Death) come visit, make sure she's eating enoughblame her possession on her use of marijuana.  Ava asks if anyone called in sick for her during her weeks long possession.  No?  Probably out of a job.  Want support from your friends?  They're probably afraid of you.  And did you try to sleep with your besty's boyfriend while that demon was inside you?

And then we meet her wonderfully deadpan attorney JJ (Dan Fogler; Hannibal, Hellbenders), who illustrates that yes, she faces a lot of vandalism and assault charges from when she was rampaging the streets with the devil in her.  It's basically jail, or join a group a lot like AA but for possession victims: Spirit Possession Anonymous.  Ava must now make amends with those she affected during her possession and take action to see that the spirit does not re-enter her.  That's the purpose of Spirit Possession Anonymous.  Besides, even The Last Exorcism (2010) had a sequel--aptly named The Last Exorcism 2 (2013). SMH

Written and directed by relative newcomer Jordan Galland (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead), this very low budget horror comedy comes with a healthy share of style.  The staging and heavy-contrast colored lighting of some scenes smacks of a hybrid between a Broadway horror play and an episode of Tales from the Crypt.  And like both, this film was clearly produced on a low budgetbut it works just fine.  At least for the first 30 minutes

Yes, that's right.  The first act of this film is good.  I liked the opening style, meeting the characters and being introduced to the consequences of possession and the notion of a support group designed for it.  The problem was that the story quickly spun into a mystery of sorts that found no sense of synthesis. Sure, I liked seeing John Ventimiglia  (The Sopranos, The Iceman), Carol Kane (Scrooged, The Princess Bride) and Alysia Reiner (Orange is the New Black), but their parts were over-filled with over-exposition delivered with uninspired dialogue.  This mystery of murder and informant prostitutes started feeling like a bad episode of Silk Stalkings.

This is where I have to say it.  Jordan Galland, I like you as a director but I think you need someone else penning your scripts after you dream up your story.  You have cool edgy ideas, but after the premise is painted your brush was stricken with acuity-warped palsy.  I loved the first 30 minutes and then got lost in the stale convolution of the next 30 minutes.  I found some redemption in the end where in a whirlwind of 15 minutes all the convoluted mess was explained in fine detail--but a little late to save the film.  Galland's story is a deep one--too bad it takes 75 minutes before you realize it.  Leave some breadcrumbs along the way of the plot next time.

There were enough good qualities here to leave me very interested in seeing what Galland does next.  I just hope he's not writing it alone and that someone gives him more of a budget.  He made the budget work for him, but we would have benefited from better (and more frequent) gore or makeup.  Overall, it's a nice little indie!",1463529600,,4033,4.8391812865497075
7606132,2,B01AKE9MZO,So many laugh out loud moments that I forgot that they were serious about this film.  Simply awful acting and writing.,1463270400,,118,4.619047619047619
7606133,4,B01AKE9MZO,"When I read the premise of this movie, I knew I had to see it. I thought the idea was so unique, and I personally don't know of any other movies that show what happens to a person after the spirit they are possessed by is exorcised. If you know of any, please let me know in the comments, because I would love to see them.

The movie starts out with the typical scene of a girl tied to the bed, and the priest doing his thing. (My mind just went to a bad place when I typed that maybe its all the cold medicine Im on.) Then a month has passed, and we see the aftermath of Avas destroyed apartment, and her family physically pulls back from her when she approaches them. Avas mom has a patch over her eye, and you just know it was Avas fault.

Avas then talks to her lawyer, and he tells her that she has three options; go to prison for harming people and property damage, go to a crazy home, or go to SPA and get help so her demon doesnt come back. She chooses SPA, and we get to see how other people react to their lives after the spirit leaves their body.

I will say I wish there were more scenes in the SPA group. I think a lot more character development could have been done here, and seeing how the different people were coping was very interesting, and in some cases, humorous.

Although this is a horror movie, to my it was more of a mystery. Avas family wants her to leave it all alone, and just get better, but she wants to find out why a demon possessed her. The mystery itself was done okay. For me the clues were laid out very quickly, and were not hard at all to figure out.

The reason Im giving it four stars instead of five, is all the unanswered questions at the end. But I would say to definitely give this one a watch.

Major Spoilers Ahead.

There are various ways that you can get possessed. They put forward the idea that it might be genetic, and another way is for someone other than yourself, to do a ritual and burn an object from your childhood that meant a lot to you.

Ava has a creepy bear go missing before shes possessed, and she keeps having waking dreams of the burnt bear talking to her, trying to give her information. If someone did burn the bear, who was it? Im thinking her sister, because towards the end, Ava sees a mark on her sisters neck. But if her sister did do it, why? They seemed to get along well, and there was never any motive given at to why she would want her sister possessed/out of the picture.

Then Ava stumbles across a file towards the end of the movie, that pertains to her mom, hinting towards the genetic aspect. If this was the case, was Avas sister possessed at one time too. But if so I would think the family would have realized it.",1463097600,,2699,4.1257142857142854

Facing multiple criminal offenses, Ava opts to go into ""Spirit Possession Anonymous"" where she meets Hazel who liked being possessed and wants to embrace her demon.

The film is a light demonic possession as compared to ""Repossessed."" There are a number of good scenes and lines, but it tapers off. There is a mystery aspect to this, one that is fairly easy to figure out, and doesn't really add to the film as the comedy aspect outweighs the mystery aspect.

Louisa Krause, who plays poor Ava, is outstanding. The story follows Ava, post demonic possession, who must attend an AA support group for the formerly possessed. While the scary supernatural plays a large role, the movie unfolds like a mystery with Ava trying to understand who, if anyone, caused or possession. I loved this movie and I would love to see a movie sequel or Amazon or Netflix making a series out of Ava's ordeals. This is a gem of a movie that deserves a wide audience. One more thing: Sean Lennon does the soundtrack, which is quite good.",1457568000,5,722,4.6484375

8747599,3,B01AKE9MZO,"When I first ran across a review of Ava's  Possessions on Looper, I was really intrigued as they listed it as one of the buried gems of Netflix and explained why. The concept is stellar - how do people cope with the ""after"" of being possessed?

 The movie starts out looking like a tongue-in-cheek slightly Buffyesque romp, with Dad saying pot may be a ""gateway drug"" to possession, Mom bringing over a cabal of vitamins, and the cleverly overturned apartment that Ava sort of blithely ignores for a bit, even though it's clear evidence of her rampage. The support group is also a brilliant idea, and the commentary on the effectiveness of such groups is quirky and makes its point.

But after that the movie slowly devolves. It can't decide if it wants to be a dark, quirky comedy, a just plain dark comedy, a mystery, a crime investigation, an incongruous romance, or an actual possession movie. As a result it wanders all over itself and never gets a grip on any genre.

The actors try hard to make it work, and there are some good but not great moments. But the writing is largely lackluster outside of a few really good lines, the character chemistry is lacking, as is the character depth, and our protagonist does some splendidly stupid things.

I did like how she handles her problem at the end (even if it was too all or nothing), or near the end, and felt a LOT more could have been done with that. Actually a lot more could have been done here period. This could have been an excellent cult classic that might have spawned a TV series. But it's largely flat. There's some interesting cinematography and music, but it can't carry the film.

What I disliked the most was the ending. It seemed to make the entire story rather pointless. It's supposed to be a cliffhanger, but I just felt disappointed and frankly rolled my eyes.

I will say this movie cured me of my fear of possession movies, so if you want some Beetlejuicy therapy along that line, by all means, watch it. But it's not worth the sticker price. If it comes back to Netflix (apparently it left), watch it for free instead.",1530662400,,2096,4.526455026455026
8747600,4,B01AKE9MZO,"If you liked. Fido, youll probably like this. Its not high budget but very good production values. Decent acting and a very entertaining story that was well developed. Absolutely worth watching. The soundtrack is great.",1518825600,,219,5.285714285714286
8747601,4,B01AKE9MZO,"Beginning where most, if not all, exorcism-related horror movies end, ""Ava's Possessions"" travels the path less taken, chronicling its titular character's recovery from a brutal bout with a demon name Naphula. It's an interesting angle to take and director Jordan Galland makes considerable hay with the concept, even if some elements fall flat. But in a genre where possession is old-hat, it's rare to see a fresh and unique take on the material. If nothing else, this film is quite unlike anything you've ever seen before.

With a style that owes considerably to Nicholas Winding Refn's retro-noir ""Drive,"" ""Ava's Possessions"" works with a brilliant color palette, numerous cockeyed and crazy angles and a moody, atmospheric score by Sean Lennon. Galland is a relatively inexperienced director (his time spent in the entertainment business has been mostly musically related) but he shows a steady hand here, establishing a style that is familiar yet titillating. Even when certain threads of the film's plot don't quite hold together, the film is an audio/visual feast. Whether it's the gory make-up and effects or simply the pouring of an orange soda, ""Ava"" is quite a sight to behold. As far as little-seen horror films you stumble upon in Netflix's library in the middle of the night, you'd be hard-pressed to find something this colorful and unique.

Where the film stumbles is in its overly complicated story. Clocking in at under 90 minutes, there's no reason for this film to be as cluttered with needless plot debris. While watching Louisa Krause find her way post-exorcism is compelling, we are constantly tripping over side characters who insist on telling us their story, too. Problem is, this is Ava's story and that story should be compelling enough on its own merits. After all, the film is essentially a metaphor for recovering from drug addiction, and that ambitious angle is never quite fully capitalized upon in favor of characters who, quite frankly, aren't really all that interesting. Sure, we are treated to veterans like Carol Kane and William Sadler, both of whom are solid in their roles, but comedic actors like Dan Fogler and Deborah Rush (""Strangers With Candy,"" represent!) are given so little to do with their talents, its a wonder they were even cast in the first place.

Flaws aside, ""Ava's Possessions"" is still a nicely made, fresh and enjoyable take on a tired genre. It tries to break new ground and mostly succeeds. Genre fans will appreciate a new spin on familiar material, while bleary eyed late-night viewers will find themselves possessed by its aesthetics. Amidst all of your Netflix binging, this one should definitely not be purged.",1508544000,,2679,5.070294784580499

8747608,5,B01AKE9MZO,"Absolutely loved it. I had seen this movie recommended a few times to me on netflix - but at the time I finally decided to watch it I didn't have access to my netflix so I went ahead and purchased it through Amazon. There is also quite a good cast, I recognized a fair number of them so it was surprising to me that this movie hadnt been on my radar sooner. Everyone played their roles brilliantly.

I laughed through most the movie and I would definitely say it falls into the dark comedy category. Ava is a normal girl except for the fact that she is facing a multitude of criminal charges for all the ""fun"" things she did while under the possession of a demon. When they gave her the option of going to a support group for other people who have been possessed I almost completely lost it. It could just be that I have family currently going through narcotics anonymous and the parallel to real life is just to comedic to pass up. I mean OF COURSE you would have the option to go to rehab to prevent yourself from being repossessed by a demon - I mean its NOT YOUR FAULT that you did all those terrible things...murder, assault, etc. Just attend these meetings and we can fix you!

I could see how this movie might not be for everyone but it had a very ""heathers"" like feel to me when it comes to someone coping with being chased by a demon who for some reason is just hell bent on making your body his. If you are looking for a good time to just sit back and enjoy a supernatural dark comedy that is so absurd you probably wouldn't be surprised if it was really going in your hometown I would recommend this movie. Plus now you have something you can question your friends about - would they still love you if you were possessed by a super aggressive, sex loving, demon? That's how you found out who your true friends are of course.

""Spoilers""
The girl who is simply begging to be repossessed because she is convinced her and her demon really made a connection and love each other - like WTH hilarious. There is always one in those groups so it should be of no surprise that there is one in this one. Now granted I have no idea what her end goal was there but she seemed happy to let him take her again - though they never made clear if it was possible to have supernatural sex with a demon who had taken over your body  /shrug who knows.

It was also pretty apparent that there was something off with the entire family and if you pay attention it is quite easy to put most of the clues together before the end but it was such a great watch. From her family helping her to cover up the murder of the hitman and then calling pot a ""gateway"" drug - for the record, i don't know any stoners who have ever been possessed by a demon but maybe we don't hang out enough.",1468368000,,2767,4.183864915572233
