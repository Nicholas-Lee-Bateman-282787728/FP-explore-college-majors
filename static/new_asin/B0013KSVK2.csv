8326076,5,B0013KSVK2,This is a great movie that reviews the great riders contests of that year in the 500cc FIM grand prix motocross schedule. Great narrating and although not every race is shown it tells the stories of the personalities and constant rider action. Highly recommended for the old schooler who missed these races when he or she was working but great for new guys who want to learn from excellent examples and now icons of the sport.,1246060800,,426,4.618421052631579
