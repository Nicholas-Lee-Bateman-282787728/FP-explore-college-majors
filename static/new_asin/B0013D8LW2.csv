It seems to me after seeing almost a dozen of his movies, that his signature style is his ability to work in any style, now confirmed by this stage play peopled by film actors who are just as good in live theater as they are in his and other directors' films.
Some of the things I most appreciate about Japanese cult director Takashi Miike are his vibrancy, his energy, and his willingness to work in various mediums and genres. He's one of the most prolific directors working today, and he still shows no sign of flagging. DEMON POND is one of his most unusual productions, a filmed play shot in 2005. Although this is very much a static production with a handful of actors sharing dialogue on stage, Miike shoots from various angles to keep it interesting.",1523750400,,906,4.633540372670807

8250050,4,B0013D8LW2,"This piece of theatre is about a small Japanese village that fears the ancient evil inside of the Demon Pond. The bell ringer of the village is rumored to keep the evil at bay with his bell, but the villagers do not believe this and fear the drought that has besieged them. The story is brilliant, even if you can see where it's going at times and it plays so smoothly that you can barely tell it was over two hours long. The acting is great and features some excellent humor from both the story and some wonderful improvisation. Great all around and beautifully captivating, I would love to see this in person someday.",1256860800,5,619,4.43859649122807
8250051,1,B0013D8LW2,"This is not the movie I remembered from the 80's. It is a live theatre stage version of the same story not the amazing live-action fantasy movie that slipped back and forth from our world to fable through the pond. I'm very disappointed, but hope to someday find the film I saw 25 years ago.  On its own this production is OK, but I'm never impressed with filmed plays.  The dialogue is too fast for subtitles over all not happy.",1240617600,20,429,4.35
