1087427,5,630581001X,"Don't listen to those other people, this is a really good film.  Since when do you have to walk away from a movie feeling different?  Since when does a movie have to MOVE YOU to be ""good""?  I went to this movie  and got exactly what I wanted: 2 hours of unencumbered escapism.  No lavish  special effects, no figuring out who Keyser Soze is, just a good use of $7  for a movie ticket.  So there!  Enjoy this movie, it's entertaining!",953856000,,433,4.246913580246914
1087428,1,630581001X,I will never watch Ally mcbeal or the practice and i will never see a Russel crowe movei beacuse the story in this was so cliched and the acting so melodramatic it makes you hate hockey,953510400,5,185,4.166666666666667

1087430,1,630581001X,The only Mystery about Mystery Alaska is who greenlighted it. Every fake movie cliche you could think of was used in this. At least few people were fooled by this joke of a movie.,951696000,10,179,4.294117647058823

1087432,5,630581001X,"This film has something for everyone. This story of the Saturday Game in the small town of Mystery, AK unfolds into a wonderful story, not just of a pond-hockey team playing against the New York Rangers, but of the pride of  an entire town. It is full of light hearted humor, but this movie is no  joke. You become a citizen of Mystery as you not only laugh, but also cry  and of course, cheer. Mystery Alaska has enough hockey to keep any sports  fan entertained. The movie also has plenty of action and drama to please  the crowd that asks ""Wayne who?""  It truely is a movie for all.  If you are a hockey fan, I am here to tell you, this is the new ""Slap  Shot"".",951436800,18,664,4.1328125

1087701,1,630581001X,"Basic guide to sports movies: at least 50% of the movie should depict people playing the sport or training for the sport. I didn't time it exactly, but I don't think there is even 25 minutes of actual hockey playing in this film. The rest is just people whining about about how terrible their lives are, and then when the mayor catches his wife in adultery he plays the total cuckold and the wife blames the victim. Blech! I can't call this a bad hockey movie because that assumes it IS a hockey movie and it isn't.",1503532800,,515,4.319587628865979
1087702,3,630581001X,it would seem that they didn't have a way to make the story fit the length of the movie so the writers ran parts of the story over and it detracted from what could have been a decent movie.,1502928000,,189,3.871794871794872

1087875,4,630581001X,"I was a teenager in the 90s, so I have a soft spot in my heart for the comedies and action-comedies I first saw back then. They didn't need to be x-rated to be sweet and funny. Not that I'm against gross-out humor and sex/nudity. I like that stuff, too. But after the 90s, those things became a crutch that movies used in lieu of cleverness or humor.

This movie has its slightly raunchy moments, too, but they feel real and thus funny. The movie could have used more hockey action, but it's still a good film.",1485820800,,510,4.257731958762887

Then, one day, the prodigal son returns with a brokered deal for the pond hockey team to play the New York Rangers.  Cue ex-boyfriend drama, montage of new pond/arena building, and a really funny cameo by Little Richard.  Definitely worth checking out.",1482883200,2,421,4.635135135135135

Excellent cast, loads of great characters, wonderful direction, beautiful scenery, and just the right balance of humor and drama.  They did an especially good job with the ending of the movie, which doesn't turn out exactly like many sports-related films do.  I discovered this movie many many years after its initial release, and it was a delightful surprise.",1445385600,,448,4.96
1088585,5,630581001X,"This is one of the all time best sports movies ever made. The story is original and unique (even if the plot is a play on the common David vs Goliath theme, the story it's put to is creative)

It's well acted. It's well made. The hockey scenes look fantastic. The characters are all interesting with very diverse back stories and motivations.

Of course the entire idea of a small town group of hockey players being able to compete with an NHL team is insane, but it's a movie.

The cast is a long list of people you'll recognize. Russel Crowe plays the role he was born to play, a quiet tough guy. He may stink as a French cop in musicals, but as an Alaskan hockey player he's dead on the money.",1445299200,,696,4.2180451127819545

I like many of the characters. Burt Reynolds is not great. Hank Azaria's character is stupid but he does well with it. It tends to paint an odd picture of rural communities which is too bad.

I will say that I was entertained. There are a lot of fine actors in the movie that do admirable work. It's the ham-fisted story and canned visuals that are the real problems. Alaska is a beautiful place... how they made a movie that at least didn't showcase a little bit of that rugged visual beauty is the real mystery.

1088869,4,630581001X,Good Movie but not for kids! I ordered it to watch with my 8 & 12 yo hockey boys even though it was rated R. I based my decision on the other reviews that said it was good for all. I thought maybe the R was just for language which I can deal with. The sex scenes and locker room talk  were uncomfortable. I made them close their eyes. The 8 yo fell asleep and by the third time I told the 12 yo to cover his eyes he decided to just go to bed and not watch the move. Disappointed as we were looking forward to a good hockey movie for family night.,1430438400,2,546,3.789473684210526

1088994,2,630581001X,"While the film is beautifully shot--the scenery is quite stunning--it is far too busy with too many character side plots to go into any depth that give this movie any meaning. There is the Russell Crowe character and his wife, and his wife and the-guy-who-left-small-town-Mystery-and-comes-back relationships. There's the Mayor, his wife, and the town womanizer who slept with the mayor's wife. There is the young kid and his ""coming-of-age"" love story. There is the fat lawyer. And, there is a Judge (soullessly acted by Burt Reynolds), who apparently used to be a great coach but now isn't but comes back? Nothing he does or says is inspiring, likable, or make one believe he was ever even a coach. None of these people and relationships get fleshed out enough to really understand or care much about these characters--which would be fine if this film was like, ""Slapshot,"" ""Major League,"" ""Caddy Shack,"" or some sports comedy--but this movie, apparently, is trying to be something else. What that something else is, was a Mystery to me.",1425945600,2,1039,5.011560693641618

1089363,5,630581001X,"My favorite Hockey Movie. I've read some criticisms of the authenticity of the hockey scenes. To that my response is ""Who cares?""
All movies takes artistic license. But after seeing this movie I, sincerely, searched for a town that this might have been based on, loosely. No such place exists.

Back to the movie. This movie is much more about relationships in a small town and within families than it is about hockey. The game is simply another backdrop. Maybe all the hockey scenes are not 100% accurate, however, the relationships are. Having lived much of my life in small town America I have seen these sorts of characters from many walks of life.

The interactions in the locker room are represented pretty faithfully to the actual beer league hockey locker rooms that I've been in. And the film captures the sights, sounds and sense of urgency when playing a game that matters to you. To the people that complained I suggest you rewatch the final game scene listen to the skates on the ice, the sound of the puck on blade during the passing, the puck hitting the goal post, the final buzzer, and most dramatically the puck hitting the ice. These are the details that were not overlooked and add dramatic effect. If you love hockey at this level you'll be intimately familiar with these sights and sounds. This moment in the film captures them beautifully.

It would be no exaggeration to say I have seen this movie more than 100 times. I have gone through a DVD, Blu-ray and bought two digital copies (1 on Amazon and 1 on iTunes). When Maury Chaykin's character is describing, in court, the town's passion for the game of hockey he could well be describing my own.",1411344000,,1672,4.641891891891892

1089417,4,630581001X,"This movie is fluffy, romantic, funny, tragic and moralistic...all the things that normally make up a mediocre film.  All of these things combine in this particular movie to create a tableau for some masterful performances made to look easy by Russel Crowe and a truly gifted ensemble of excellent actors and actresses.  The backdrop of sports and the rugged craggy Canadian Rocky Mountains are dramatic elements ever present and perfectly inserted to form a strong foundation to support the plot.  I lived in Alaska and visited dozens of remote areas in that marvelous state and the village community presence they use in the movie nails the isolated small town ""everyone is aware of everything"" environment right to the wall.  I have seen this movie at least 5 times and will undoubtedly watch it again.  Even though this film is an old friend, it still leaves me with a comfortable sense of fulfillment each time I see it.",1410566400,,925,4.86624203821656

Burt Reynolds plays the Judge in Mystery and who also has a love of Hockey.  I think this was Burt's best part, you got to see many sides of his character I can't imagine anyone else playing his part.
Colin Meany always brings something special to the characters that he plays.
You understand who these people are and why Hockey is so important to them.

I like the humor and the hockey aspect is pretty well done. I don't understand why some reviewers gave it poor ratings because it wasn't accurate as far as the hockey story goes. Really though since when do movies have to be accurate to be good, the whole reason behind a movie is to escape for a little while and be sucked into a story.

It's about the little guy, the one that wants to win for the whole town. Burt Reynolds is great as the judge who takes over the team after the coach has a heart attack, Frank Azaria plays  the home town boy who's made good, and returns the conquering hero, or not. But Russell Crowe is wonderful as the town sheriff, trying to hold it all together until the big game. All of the actors playing the parts of the young hockey players, are simply perfect in their parts. The citizens of this Alaskan town, Mystery, all mesh together  like a spider web, I think it's a good analogy, spiders, spinning a web. Story is about a small town's local hockey team that gets the chance to play the professionals, in Mystery, on the home pond. Things don't go too well for the organizers. Towns people dream of big things for Mystery's future. Heck, everyone's future. There's so much going on that it's hard to keep up.

Russell Crowe stars as John Biebe, one of the players on a rag-tag team of amateurs based out of Alaska, who somehow end up playing the New York Rangers in an exhibition game.

I am a huge hockey fan, but you certainly don't have to be to enjoy Mystery, Alaska. It's just as much about community as it is about the game. And I'm not a huge Burt Reynolds fan, but I do enjoy him in this movie. In fact, the cast from top to bottom is great. Ironically, it's not Hank Azaria that provides the big laughs, it's Michael McKean -- and he is hilarious.

A hysterical story to tell, a small handfull of quirky-funny chararacters with action (of all types) including the glorious sport of ice hockey, drama & suspense, located in beautiful Alaska.  That's a mouthful to say & this movie is absolutely everything a movie should be. Mr. Russell Crowe makes acting appear effortless with so little said.  Flawless & smooth Burt Reynolds, Colm Meany... all the actors are spot on.  It's a great movie & the kind where ya sit on the edge of your seat, laughing & excited for the coming scenes.

This is by no means a bad movie, just don't expect anything out of the  ordinary. They set up the situations in the first 20 minutes or so, so the viewer can pretty much see where things are headed. The only real question is how they are going to deal with the big showdown between the New York Rangers and the locals. I did rather enjoy the outcome.

The ensemble cast is good. The directing is adequate and Carter Burwell's music score is very good. He chose to write the pieces with a Native American tinge to them. It put a very nice touch on things. Though Russel Crowe is the headliner he does not get the screen time one might expect. Quite a few of the characters get heard throughout.

My biggest disappointment was the big game itself. It really wasn't choreographed or directed all that well. Was it lack of budget or was it merely trying to get actors to skate well enough to convince the viewing audience that they knew what they were doing. At any rate, that was quite a letdown. Plus you get to see nothing of the New York Rangers and how they perceive the game from their end. They're faceless.

So this is NOT recommended for fans of the Mighty Ducks.

You also have a chilly Little Richard making an appearance, an old woman who complains a lot, cheating housewives, Russell Crowe playing with his hair (what a weird guy) and then serious stuff like the hockey team training on the ice and facing the Rangers.  The movie wants you to get into the small town and absorb the feel of the people and the way they go about their lives, but it never really works because the story is supposed to be about ice hockey.

It's no Rocky, though. That movie had real gravitas.

Russel Crowe is great, of course, but his acting is beside the point. He's only one small part of this larger town, and the movie doesn't focus on him, not like it should in order to be labeled a good movie.

The fact is, though--I guess I should admit it--I enjoyed Mystery, Alaska. It was a feel good movie about how it's okay to live in a small town. The people in small towns are just as good as the jerks from the big cities who look down on them and call them ""hicks"" or even ""lumberjacks"" in this case. Being from a small town in South Carolina, I sympathized with that point. It made me feel warm inside.

And the characters are likeable, too. I found myself caring about them. I wanted them to make good. I wanted their lives to be enjoyable. I wanted them to win their big hockey game.

He is not particularly talented and makes the same faces in every film, and it drives me CRAZY! In this case, we have what could have been an okay movie, but Russell Crowe poisoned the whole thing with his very presence.

""Mystery, Alaska"" has the potential to be a decent movie. It's about the small Alaskan town of Mystery, a place where everybody knows everyone else and each resident is obsessed with the game of hockey. One day a former Mystery resident turned sports promoter returns to town with very exciting news: he's set up an exhibition game between Mystery amateur hockey players and the New York Rangers. The people of Mystery must learn to put aside their various differences and pull together in preparation for the event of a lifetime.

This film is sentimental and can basically be summed up in one cliche: ""It's not about whether you win or lose; it's how you play the game."" There are several strong performances in this movie, including Hank Azaria as Mystery's prodigal son and Burt Reynolds as the town judge/coach. However, Russell Crowe spoiled the whole film for me. He plays the town sheriff/hockey player/coach, and he's basically just a big cocky oaf on ice. There's this one scene where Crowe's character is supposed to have a ""touching"" moment with his wife. He crosses out a bunch of words in a newspaper column and instructs his wife to read the remaining characters out loud. I think the intention of the scene was for Crowe's character to come across as being all sentimental and deep, but it was just incredibly stupid and serves as a perfect example of how every movie Crowe is in basically turns to garbage.

The game sequences toward the end of the movie are worth the wait. However the film does turn to many of the underdog cliches so common to sports themed movies. The pace tends to slow a bit when the focus turns to some of the romances going on in the small town of Mystery.

1090471,4,630581001X,"A very pleasant surprise, Midnight, Alaska, brings to the screen the story of small hockey town in Alaska as it prepares for an exhibition game against the NY Rangers.

What the townsfolk do not realize is that their lives are about to change and not necessarily because of the sudden media attention...

I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant and entertaining movie!

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Russel Crowe, Hank Azaria, Colm Meaney, Burt Reynolds and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

In short, Midnight, Alaska is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1137456000,5,1370,4.751054852320675

Hank Azaria's final realization about Mystery, Crowe's deftly played performance as the approximately 30 yr. old Captain.

There was nothing really bad, it was just that after all the emotion and laughter churned up during the entire movie, it just sort of ends nicely, not bad, but not a terrific ending either.  Just sort of lackluster ending.

The husband/wife interraction between McCormack and Crowe was especially realistic.  Crowe has not had such great chemistry with anyone since Meg Ryan in PROOF OF LIFE.  Mary McCormack would have been the perfect wife in his upcoming ""CINDERELLA MAN"" film!",1117324800,4,882,5.041379310344827

He garners the small town some big time noteriety when the announces that the New York Rangers will challenge a game against the locals pond hockey team.  Typical small town chaos ensues as all prepare for the big event.

Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Mary McCormack all turn in fine performances contributing nicely to the oddities inherent in any small town.

1090589,5,630581001X,"What makes MYSTERY ALASKA such a joyful movie experience is its heart, and the remarkably good cast.  In the vein of such films as ROCKY, the story of the Mystery Alaska team facing the New York Rangers is merely a means to the end.  What this movie is really about is pride, loyalty and the sense of courage to go against seemingly unreachable odds and come out with your pride and honor intact.  This is not a ""Russell Crowe"" movie, although the Oscar winner is superb as John Biebe.  This is a group effort and the cast has some shining moments:  Ron Eldard (The Runner) plays Skank, the team's sexually active member, who is screwing the mayor's wife (Lolita Davidovich).  In a memorable scene, Eldard confronts the Mayor (Colm Meany) and apologizes to him, with a sense of sincerity you hadn't seen before.  One expects Meany to throw a punch or yell and scream; watch to find out how it plays out.  Lolita Davidovich and Meany also have a tense but touching moment when she tells him why she slept with Eldard; Crowe and Mary McCormack as his wife share several touching scenes that show how deep a love can go; Burt Reynolds as the gruff judge/coach has a shining moment when he addresses the townspeople in a trial of a player who shot a visiting department store magnate in the foot; Maury Chaykin as Bailey Pruitt has key scenes and a very poignant one in the courtroom; Judith Ivey as Reynolds's wife has a wonderful moment when she's discussing sex with her teenage daughter (Rachel Wilson).  The movie is full of nice scenes, and refreshing changes of pace thanks to the screenplay by David E. Kelley (Picket Fences).  Even Hank Azaria as the homeboy producer avoids the expected cliches of his role---one can tell he really did love Beibe's wife.

A real surprise of a movie, one that should entertain and make you feel good.",1092960000,6,1839,4.610429447852761
1090590,4,630581001X,"""Mystery, Alaska"" juggles quite a few cliches, but it does so with wonderful charm and a constant nudge in the ribs.
A small town in the frozen North of Alaska, Mystery loves its hockey beyond all reason.  The famed ""Saturday Game,"" played each week with religious fervor, has been brought to the pages of Sports Illustrated by a Mysterian (Hank Azaria) who has left the town for bigger and better things -- although it may be because everyone in town says he plays hockey ""like a homosexual"" (this is an example of the surprisingly frank and profane language Mysterians like to use, which can be jarring in what is otherwise a sweet movie).
The team, led by John Biebe (Russell Crowe in a nice understated performance), is your typical bunch of loveable small-town lugs, each given either one defining characteristic (babe hound, son struggling with sense of inadequacy, hot young prodigy nervous about playing with the ""big boys,"" etc.) or is mere entertaining window dressing.  Otherwise content with the local fame brought by playing in the Saturday game, the guys are exhilirated and terrified to learn that the NHL wants the New York Rangers (at the time, a good team!) to visit Mystery to play the locals as a publicity stunt.
Biebe, who is also the town sheriff, is our lens into this quirky town going through this tumultuous development.  A fixture of the Saturday Game for years, he is surprisingly demoted and asked to coach.  One of his best players 'accidentally' shoots a representative from Price World, a Wal-Mart clone.  Another player cuckolds the mayor of the town.  And Azaria returns to make overtures to Biebe's wife.  The tranquil little burg has never seen such excitement.
All of this unfolds in a lighthearted manner and builds to the ""big game"" against the Rangers -- which is only brought about by the untimely demise of a lovable local resident.
The game is handled very well, with the proper ""underdog"" notes played, but not overly so.  The hockey action flows quickly, and feels like a game rather than someone filming a pretend game (a common problem in sports movies -- the action is not realistic enough).  One problem - we rarely see Russell Crowe actually skate, which undercuts his status as the team leader and reminds us that he's a Hollywood star in a hockey film.
Perhaps the movie's most inspired moment is the mayor's unique way of invoking Mystery's home-ice advantage during the national anthem (with a hilarious cameo by Little Richard - yes, you heard me).  Watch also for a great cameo by Mike Meyers, who has worked with director Jay Roach on the Austin Powers films.
In the end, all loose ends are tied up nicely . . . and perhaps too conveniently for some.  Nothing in the movie is a great shock, but that's life in a small town for you.
While in many respects a good family movie, the language and humor is definitely not for younger viewers.  And the ""romantic"" overtures of Skank, the team horn-dog, can be quite shocking to some.  Still, a good movie and a fun time.",1085097600,5,3022,4.733333333333333
1090591,5,630581001X,"If you're interested in this movie, it's probably because it stars Russell Crowe. But if you thought that was the only reason to see this film, have I got some good news for you.

Mystery, Alaska, population 633, is a town obsessed with hockey. From the time they're children, every Mystery boy's dream is to be a member of the town's unnamed hockey team in the weekly ""Saturday game."" Through a sequence of events only slightly farfetched, the Mystery team is scheduled for an exhibitition game with the visiting New York Rangers, an event of only slightly less importance to this hockey-struck town than the Second Coming. One of the many great things about this movie is the town's reaction to news of the impending game. They're not awestruck by the Rangers, the visiting demi-gods; their first reaction is, ""Can we win?"" If Mystery plays, they intend to win. The Rangers might be big league American hockey, but Mystery has faith in its boys. It knows they're great even if the rest of the world doesn't.

The movie is about how the town and its inhabitants are affected by the upcoming game. The game itself, though perfectly realized in the film, is almost incidental. Colm Meaney (late of Star Trek: The Next Generattion and Deep Space Nine) plays the town mayor who discovers his wife (Lolita Davidovich) is sleeping with a member of the hockey team. Hank Azaria is Charles Danner, the home town boy who was never respected growing up, became a reporter out in the great big world, brings back to Mystery the NEW YORK RANGERS....and finds he's still not respected. Donna Biebe (Mary McCormack) is the girl Charles loved in high school, now married to team captain and town sheriff John Biebe (Crowe). Burt Reynolds, who still has it, and in spades, after all these years, plays town judge Walter Burns. Walter as a young man wasn't good enough for the Saturday game, a fact he's never forgotten and a source of conflict with his son, who's made the current team. But Walter was good enough for minor league hockey in the lower 48, making him the perfect choice to coach the team for and through the big game. He's the only person in town who really understands North American hockey. For his own reasons, he refuses.

Then there's Russell Crowe as John Biebe. The big game comes at the tail end of John's career. After 13 years in the Saturday game - a Mystery record - he's cut from the team just before news of the Rangers' visit hits town. And the town fathers, whose most solemn duties involve administering the hockey team, don't want him back. A man of quiet strength but not good at expressing his softer emotions, John doesn't know how to tell his wife how much he loves her when he sees Charles flirting, and her flirting back. The way he figures out finally to do that is both inventive and touching.

Though this movie ""stars"" Russell Crowe, it's not a star driven vehicle, it's an ensemble piece. And while Russell is wonderful as John Biebe, for my money the best performance in the film is Ron Eldard as ""Skank"" Marden, Mystery hockey player and dedicated fornicator. The scene where Skank appears on the mayor's doorstep one frozen night to apologize to the man he's cuckolded is, I think, the highlight of the film. It's fascinating to watch the unexpected decency, sensitivity, and dignity emerge from what til then seemed an indecent, shallow, undignified man.

The hockey game footage is convincing - thrilling, actually. Russell learned to ice skate for this role, and, with the help of some careful editing, looks pretty darn good on the ice. Numerous Rangers play themselves.

Mystery, Alaska has been called ""Rocky On Ice"" and that's a fair description. Yes, the film deals with a hockey game, but that's not what makes it special. This isn't a dumb, gimmicky, braindead hockey flick like The Mighty Ducks. It's a character driven, imaginative, well-acted drama....that happens to work within the framework of a story about a hockey game. By the time the Rangers arrive in Mystery you're totally on the home team's side, rooting for them because you've come to care for the Mystery boys, and respect the sacrifices they, and the town as a whole, have made for this game. Like Rocky, Mystery, Alaska shows you don't need a huge budget to make a good movie when you have a great script, solid direction, good actors, and the film possesses that quality indefinable but impossible to mistake or ignore: ""heart.""

On top of that, the story is really very good, and the script is expertly written; the movie tells the tale of a small town (Mystery, Alaska), where the central fact of life is the game of hockey. This obsession manifests itself in an event called the Saturday Game, where the town's hockey team plays teams from neighboring towns on a frozen over pond in astonishingly cold weather. But the game, and the town that depends on it for its common bond, becomes strangely manipulated by a turn of events that proposes that Mystery's team play the New York Rangers a game of hockey on the small town pond.

There is a hockey game played every Saturday by the ten best hockey players in town. The players are chosen by a committee which presides over the game.
The story centers around John Biebe (Russell Crowe), who gives an awarding performance as an aging hockey player who just happens to be the town's sheriff.
The conflict starts when John is described in an article featured in Sports Illustrated, as a great passer, being slow of foot and the only player without lightening speed.  The article is written by the town's outcast Charlie Danner (Hank Azaria) who also happens to be his wife Donna's old boyfriend.

I was in Blockbuster, locating movies for my own Crowe film festival and the cover caught my eye before I realized he was even in it. So back went the wonderful ""The Insider"" (filmed partially in my hometown) for another day.
I am so glad I did because ""Mystery Alaska"" was such a surprising discovery that I'm constantly suggesting it to friends and family, particularly to see Crowe in a role quite unlike his more famous Bud White, Maximus, Jeffrey Wigand and John Nash. Once again, the talented Aussie reveals his wide range, and the fact that he is a true actor and not simply a movie star.
This time he is not the savior of Rome, or courageous whistleblower, or multi-faceted Fifties cop, but John Biebe (Bee-be), sheriff in a tiny Alaskan town where hockey is as much a religion as college basketball is in Kentucky! For thirteen years he has been on the Mystery hockey team and played in the ""Saturday game"" -- made up of townsmen -- but as with many athletes, although in his thirties, he is replaced by a younger, up and rising player. On top of that blow is the return of Hank Azaria as sleazy hometown boy who got away, became a writer, and returns with a publicity stunt to bring the New York Rangers to Mystery to play the local team. (Azaria had written a Sports Illustrated article on the Mystery team, and that attracted attention). Azaria dated Crowe's wife (Mary McCormick)in high school, and Biebe's jealousy surfaces. So not only does Biebe have to accept his new role on the team, but his feelings towards his wife's old boyfriend, as well as other little incidents going on within their small town.
As he's done with other characters, Crowe gives Biebe several layers so that we see a man at a crossroads in his life. In fact, it's watching scenes with Crowe that make this movie as beautiful as the scenery! The man can express more with his facial features than most so-called actors can with a page of words: whether a smile, the glow of love in his eyes, his jealousy, his hurt, the permanent loss of a good friend. In one scene, when you see the tears and how red his eyes are, then hear the emotion in his voice, you feel his pain as well. But let's face it ladies, you can't help watching one locker room scene several times to *clears throat* study Crowe's physical talents! *bg* (Okay, he has great arms. LOL)
Seriously, the movie is a small charmer, from Crowe and Maury Chaykin (of ""The Insider""), to the Canadian views portraying Alaska, to some rather humorous lines (""Women don't like to be referred to as fat mammals..."") John Biebe has become one of my top three Russell Crowe characters, even more than Maximus and Bud. After seeing this movie, he may become one of yours too. I regret the DVD doesn't contain more special features but I can deal with it. Definitely pick this one up for your Crowe collection!",1021939200,2,2956,4.568738229755179
1090708,4,630581001X,"The glistening white world of "" Mystery, Alaska"" presents us with a tale of a hockey town its quirky characters, and the opportunity of their local team to play the New York Rangers, presented to them by Hank Azaria's cocky sports reporter, Charles Danner, a former resident of Mystery.
 Amid this pure, alabaster-looking world is a community dominated by the members of its hockey team. It's not an easy town for women to live in, and many a local lass, including the Mayor's wife, has compromised or almost compromised her virtue with the town heroes, who are full of crass fraternity hijinks and like many townsfolk, equally crass language.
 Burt Reynolds gives a great performance as Judge Walter Burns, the town mentor, who taught numerous kids to skate, and who tries to keep his teenaged daughter, played by Rachel Wilson, away from the lecherous hockey players whereas Judith Ivey's Mrs. Burns seems slightly more passive about the situation, although she confronts her daughter about it at one point. Scott Grimes plays Reynolds' son who feels his future lies in hockey rather than academics.
 Colm Meany hides his Irish accent well as the Mayor who is betrayed by his wife, played by Lolita Davidovitch when she sleeps with the notorious Skank Marden(Ron Eldard). The depths of betrayal don't seem to affect the couple as much as they might in real life once they come to terms with it.
 Russell Crowe's mastery of the subtle, smoldering glance is not lost in his portrayal of the town Sherriff and hockey team Captain, John Biebe. Tossing his moreno-colored, chestnut- streaked mane of hair, squaring shoulders as mountainous as the Canadian scenery(which doubled for Alaska), and speaking with an accent that sounds slightly Nova Scotian, he is one of the more dignified characters in the film with one of the most solid marriages. Azaria's return to town threatens him because his wife, Donna, is Azaria's former girlfriend. Mary McCormack gives a warm-hearted, sympathetic portrayal of Donna Biebe, eventually reassuring her husband that she has no regrets about marrying him. Their reconciliation after a heated argument is poignant, coltish, and downright sexy without revealing too much flesh.
 Maury Chaykin's Bailey Pruitt is the lawyer who gives his life trying to secure the hockey match when it is nearly cancelled. Michael McKean plays the wounded Price World Representative who shows us how not to behave when accidentally shot by a hockey player in a hockey town, if we want a jury to decide in our favor. Kevin Durand's Tree is the stereotypical dim-witted but kind-hearted jock. Comical moments include Megan Price's Sarah Heinz putting the disreputable Skank in his place, and Crowe's unsuccessful attempt to suppress his laughter when dealing with the case.
 There are fun cameos by Little Richard and Mike Myers during the game. Perhaps the best moments of the game are when Crowe's tender family man pauses to signal ""I love yous"" to his wife and sons while on the ice, and flash that brilliant smile to the audience.
 The outcome of the match is unsatisfyingly realistic. But when Sheriff Biebe places a puck on the grave of the man who fought to prevent the game's cancellation, a bit of foliage before the cross, pushing its way up through the relentless snow, somehow symbolises the determination of the Mystery team in the face of great odds. --A great metaphor for the citizens of Mystery within itself.",1020038400,3,3440,5.003496503496503
1090709,4,630581001X,"I love hockey, and I love David E. Kelley, so it's no great surprise that I also loved ""Mystery, Alaska."" Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Colm Meaney, Ron Eldard, and Kevin Durand all turn in convincing, heart-warming performances, and the setting (in Banff) is just spectacular.
The story takes places in the fictional town of Mystery, deep in Alaska's mountains. It's incredibly cold there, and the town's favorite pasttime is hockey. The Mystery boys are undefeated on pond ice, and the Saturday game is a huge deal for the little burg. Hank Azaria's character had left Mystery to pursue a writing career, and made the town famous with an article in ""Sports Illustrated,"" which caught the eye of NHL bigwigs. The bigwigs signed the New York Rangers, one of the NHL's long-standing great teams, to come up and play an exhibition game against the Mystery team.
The results of that decision are what drives this movie, and in the end, winning or losing the game itself isn't what's important. It's a story about communities, relationships, and the strong bonds between teammates. Don't let this fool you into thinking it's a chick flick, tho; it's a movie that men and women alike will enjoy. There are laugh-out-loud moments, and lot of big grin moments, and a few very heart-touching ones as well, but nothing overly-sappy.
The DVD extra features are sadly lacking, though, the only one of interest being an exceedingly brief behind-the-scenes featurette, which has a few moments of interest, but generally doesn't have anything overwhelming to offer. I would have loved to have seen some outtakes of skating mishaps and cut-ups. Alas.

The best players participate in the ""Saturday Game"" where citizens play 5-on-5 hockey on a small pond with no lines, no boards, but lots of fans.  A former Mystery resident, now a promoter, comes back to his home town with a proposal that the hometown boys take on the New York Rangers.  What are the chances--but who cares when the town joins together in mutual pride to face down their vaunted rivals.  Nothing too deep here, but just good fun and old-timey, small-town spirit.

Secondly, I loved this movie because of it's casting...BEFORE Russel Crowe was ""Russel Crowe,"" where it seems the actors were cast to best fill their roles rather than to bring up numbers at the box office.

Eventually we get to see the game, and it was nice to see them not end it with a total ""feel-good"" ending.  You can probably guess what I mean by that, but you should buy or rent it anyway.

Of all the hockey initiated films that I have seen, Mystery, Alaska is the most accurate.  The lives of the hockey players in the movie are just like my true life and my life is sad.  At about the age of 14, hockey becomes very vicious, brutal and intimidating.  A lot of my teammates were dirty goons who only played the sport for it's open violence and, off the ice were sex obsessed.  This is just how the movie is portrayed and that's just what hockey is like.  It isn't a topic that should have been made into a movie unless it was proving a point. It doesn't tell in any way, tell that the greatness at all levels of hockey is diminishing, but it is.  Soon enough, it won't even be a sport anymore. This movie just repeats the sad truth.  It is damned sad that most players either don't care about anything but hockey, or don't give enough respect to the sport. Mystery, Alaska reinstates this and by making this movie, they worsened the chance of hockey shaping up.  As for the plot, the pond game was boring and having the heroes lose didn't give it any kind of original cleverness or genius ending.  This movie is a shame.",977443200,11,1220,4.288209606986899

When a former  neighbor returns home bringing the New York Rangers to play against  Mystery's legendary hockey team, the town sheriff, recently bumped from the  team for a younger player who's got ""jump"", agrees to coach. The  members of the team are fleshed out well by an ensemble cast of virtual  unknowns, with the exception of Russell Crowe. The ending is exciting, and  surprisingly unpredictable.  For me, the actor that stole the show was  Ryan Northcott, a barely credited character, who plays the pivotal role of  the high school skating whiz who takes Russell Crowe's place on the team.  He has a couple of the most amusing, and embarassing, scenes in the movie,  and handles them with humor and grace.

1090963,5,630581001X,"It's cold in the small hamlet of Mystery, Alaska, but there's plenty of warmth in ""Mystery, Alaska,"" the film, directed by Jay Roach, about the  town and the sport that is ingrained in the collective consciousness of the  community.  Hockey is the game, and when a former resident, now a  journalist, writes a story about Mystery's home-town team and their  ""Saturday Game,"" and it ends up as a three page spread complete with  pictures in Sports Illustrated, it has far reaching effects on the populace  of this small dot on the map.  Soon the town is turned upside down,  embroiled in an event, the proportions of which, to them, are huge.  Needless to say, it involves hockey and an encounter with a high-profile  professional team.  Yes, there is a lot of hockey in this movie, but be  advised, this film is not ""about"" hockey; this is a movie about people-  real people- and what makes them tick.  Roach has crafted a  thoroughly entertaining and emotional story of want and need, dignity and  desire, obsession and love, and he's captured it all through the winning  performances of a stellar ensemble cast, the most prominent of which is  Russell Crowe.  The charismatic Crowe, finally on his way to superstardom  thanks to his turn in ""Gladiator"" plays John Biebe, Mystery's sheriff and  captain of the hockey team.  His rugged good looks and persona fit the  character perfectly, and he puts all of his myriad personal resources to  work to put it across, and that he does.  Also notable is the personable  Mary McCormack as John's wife, Donna, who does a great job of fleshing out  the character of this woman who made what she deems to be the right choices  in her life, without regrets or apologies to herself or anyone else.  It's  a refreshing portrayal, and the chemistry between her and Crowe is  unmistakable.  Also adding to the overall texture of this film are Hank  Azaria, as Charles Danner, the journalist who gets the whole thing rolling;  Burt Reynolds, as Judge Walter Burns, a man forced to deal with his own  personal issues, which include a son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), a member of  the hockey team; Colm Meany, as Scott Pitcher, Mayor of Mystery, and Lolita  Davidovich as his wife, Mary Jane; Maury Chaykin, as Bailey Pruitt, the man  who seems to personify the very essence of Mystery's spirit; and Ron Eldard  as ""Skank,"" another member of the team who's good for two things-suffice to  say that hockey is one of them.  Mercifully, ""Mystery, Alaska"" never  pursues the beat-the-dead-horse cliched mentality that sports ""teaches one  to be a team player and builds character.""  Instead, Roach has given us a  worthwhile, memorable movie with a human touch, and because of that, in the  end these are people you care about, as individuals as well as a community.  The climactic game is exciting and far from predictable, beginning with  the celebrity they bring in to sing the National Anthem.  This may not be  one of Russell Crowe's biggest or highest profile movies, but this is one  he's going to be able to look back upon with pride, because it's right up  there with his best.

Being a member of the team is a prestigious and revered position in  Mystery. There is no pay or  world wide fame gained from being in the  Saturday game, but the men  play because their fathers played, and their  fathers played.

David Kelley's ability to capture the essence of a place through  interesting characters has long been demonstrated on television, and he's  in good form, here.  Mind you, his characters here are somewhat ordinary by  PICKET FENCES or ALLY MCBEAL standards, but they're still more  attention-grabbing than characters usually offered up in sports movies.
Indeed, if the film has a real fault it's that Kelley has so enjoyed his  own visit to Mystery that he's written about almost too many characters.  The film would probably have been helped by a little judicious editing, or  by more closely linking the subplots, but the meander is far from  unpleasant.
This is no doubt because these many characters are played by  fine actors.  The cast is fairly loaded with talent, and all of them get  at least a few memorable lines.  By far most impressive is Burt Reynolds,  whose acting continues to improve even after decades in the business.  He's clearly gone to some effort, here, creating a precise vision for his  character that goes so far as to include an especially subtle Alaskan  accent.
Parents should be warned, however, that amidst what is  otherwise a family film are some fairly long stretches of adult language  that, while character-appropriate, may be objectionable to some. This  should be a minor concern to most parents, however, as the ultimate message  of the movie is entirely praiseworthy and could spark useful and  instructive family discussions.

And the film has a good plot.. but only if it was carried out  just a little bit more stronger.. it could of been a better in my oponion..  but this movie is really they type where the ending definately makes the  movie worth seeing...,959644800,,965,4.312849162011173

Great acting, believeable characters, laughs, sadness, and  cheers.  What a heart-warming movie that did not drag for a second! A movie  that gals and guys would find wonderful! What a great town and wonderful  scenery in this small and cold town!  I would recommend it to anyone.  The  only downside is that it has some language and a few scenes that might not  be good for small children. But these scenes are needed in the movie.  When  this movie is discounted, it will be a purchase for me! 5 STARS",959558400,,668,4.421487603305785
1091045,3,630581001X,"Mystery Alaska was a good film about Hockey.  It kind of reminded me of The Bad News Bears meets the NHL.  Instead of kids however, the Mystery Alaska hockey team are a bunch of Adults all with problems of their  own...which you will find out about by watching this.  The cast is good,  and I would say the 2nd half of the movie is much more fast paced than the  first.  It was another good performance by Burt Reynolds.  Die Hard Hockey  fans will love this movie.  ALl others I would recommend renting this  before purchasing it.",959385600,,531,4.371134020618556
1091046,4,630581001X,"Well, I'm a woman and I'm NOT a hockey fan and I was pleasantly surprised when I found that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I came to care about the characters (and they are real CHARACTERS) in this little Alaskan town.  The movie was very funny while also very touching. There were so many  special touches added (like a couple surprise cameo appearances) which add  to the fun.  The acting was topnotch, especially Russell Crowe and even  Burt Reynolds.  I found myself laughing outloud in more than one scene and  cheering for the 'underdog' team during the final game. This movie isn't so  much about hockey as about the human spirit, value of relationships and  hometown pride.  I'll definitely buy this movie when the price comes down.",958694400,4,743,4.771653543307087
1091047,3,630581001X,"Pretty much what you'd expect. Small-town guys who excel at one thing get a chance do good, prove themselves. I thought the idea of the almost-ritual tradition of the town's Saturday hockey team was interesting and wished  they'd developed the idea a little.  That's my big complaint: the  characters and themes are underdeveloped in favor of moving along with the  hackneyed storyline of amateur underdog versus professional goons. Still,  the film is entertaining enough, and the hockey game at the end is  well-paced and exciting without becoming outrageous. I wouldn't shell out  the bucks to buy a copy, but worth renting.",958608000,,627,5.148514851485149
1091048,4,630581001X,"after seeing lake placid, i was weary about trying another one of his featured films.  However, I was pleaasnatly surprised.  I actually really cared about the characters and to see the NY Rangers fly in by helicopter  was a great and cool scene.  The ending was great although unexpected.  Worth a rental!",958176000,,306,4.8076923076923075
1091049,4,630581001X,"This is a likeable film using the hackneyed ""obscure underdog"" storyline.  David E. Kelley tries his hand at writing another feature film after the bizarre `Lake Placid'.  This is certainly better than that abomination, but  the plot presents us with nothing new or fresh and meanders around town  doing random character studies on unimportant characters.  Still, it's hard  not to like a film where a small town hockey club roughs up the New York  Rangers.
The story revolves around the small town of Mystery, Alaska  where the only thing to do or talk about is hockey.  John Biebe (Russell  Crowe) is the sheriff and a veteran of the Saturday hockey game, which is  the focal point of Mystery's culture.  As a result of an article written in  Sports Illustrated, the NHL and the NY Rangers think it would be a good  promotional gimmick for the Rangers to play this scrappy bunch of amateurs.  So now the town is in a tizzy over this defining moment in their  history.
Kelley's script expands this film to be much longer than it  should have been.  He spends far too much time following the gossip of  who's sleeping with whom among ancillary characters, and not enough time in  character development of the players other than Biebe.  Director Jay Roach  does a good job, however of keeping the viewer engaged through the use of  excellent hockey action shots that take you right onto the ice.  Also, how  can you not love the majestic mountain backdrops in just about every  outdoor scene.
Once the film at long last gets to the game, it succeeds  at accomplishing what the formula intends, that is, it gets us to pull hard  for the underdog.
For Russell Crowe, this was much less intense than his  roles in `The Insider' and `Gladiator'.  He did a nice job of portraying  the old warhorse, giving the character steadiness, dignity and  determination.  I wonder where a guy from Australia learned to ice skate so  well.  Colm Meaney gave a good performance as the mayor but Burt Reynolds  was a little stiff as the judge (maybe it's rigor mortis).
Though there  is a lot to criticize about this film, it is still entertaining and for  those who love hockey, it does a good job of providing some up-close action  footage of the game.  I rated it a 7/10.",958003200,3,2254,4.636132315521628
1091150,4,630581001X,"This is a terrific movie for any hockey fan to own.  Until now I have watched the very old ""Youngblood"" with Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze over a dozen times this hockey season alone. Is it real life? Of  course not!  However, it is a movie that inspires you as any true sports  movie  such as ""Rudy"" or ""Brian's Song"" or ""Bull  Durham"" or ""Tin Cup"" does.  This is a fantastic film that  easily fills the gap in anyone's sports film library.  Why didn't I give it  a 5?  I always leave room for improvement not matter what I am rating...",957916800,,535,4.198019801980198
1091151,4,630581001X,"If you were looking for a movie about hockey, sorry.  This movie is much better than that.  It is about friendship and the bonds people form when they spend their lives together.  The small town atmosphere is so true.  I  was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was.  I laughed and I  cried.  Russell Crowe is a great actor.  This is a movie to watch anytime  with your friends and the ones that you love!",957916800,,413,4.315789473684211
1091152,3,630581001X,"The last 30 minutes of this film really saved it for me.  It has action packed hockey, and moving drama.  In the last 30 minutes, I finally sensed the bond and brotherhood theme of the movie.  Unfortunately, the first hour  and a half are not as good.  The story doesn't go deep enough into the  characters, there is an inconsistant mix of drama and comedy, and, even  though gratuitious sex can be fun in some movies, it really hurt this one.  My main point is, this movie was supposed to be about brotherhood and  hockey, and it shows in the last 30 minutes, but the first part of the  movie could have been better.  Also, the gratutious sex and select language  is why this movie got rated R.  It would have been a great PG-13, and still  would have got its theme accross without the gratuitous stuff.  As for the  DVD, you get a small ammount of features: a trailer and a 5 minute  featurette.",957830400,3,897,4.33939393939394
1091153,4,630581001X,"I figured Mystery, Alaska would be an okay movie, something to see with my wife on a Saturday night but nothing to write home about.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying Mystery, Alaska; it's actually  a very well-edited, well-written film which overcomes its cliches through  good acting and an unusual plotline.
Anyone who has lived in a small  town and experienced small town sports will immediately find a soft spot  for this movie.  Much like the boys in Hoosiers, the heroes of Mystery,  Alaska are the over-achieving yet mysteriously talented local boys who play  an entirely different brand of hockey than the glitzy millionaires from New  York. Yet the millionaires don't get villified; the movie isn't about them  at all. This is a movie about community more than sports.
One of the  most effective elements of the film is the opening credits. The stunning  visual imagery of a young man skating a frozen river in the middle of  nowhere is just plain cool, in my humble opinion!
Mystery, Alaska is a  movie about friendship and support in adversity, and how you can always  forgive one of your own when they set off for ""bigger and better  things.""  I would highly recommend Mystery, Alaska for anyone who  sometimes just wants to go home again.",957830400,5,1275,4.824074074074074
1091154,5,630581001X,"I am a woman, and yes I love hockey, and yes I love this movie. The cast is made up of loveable and endearing characters, not the least of which is Russell Crowe, who love hockey so much they play every weekend on their  small home pond. Crowe gives a strong performance as the elder statesman of  the group whose position on the team is threatened when a former resident  (Hank Azaria) returns to stage a challenge of the Mystery, Alskan team  agains tthe New York Rangers. All the while, Crowe is left feeling  vulnerable because of the success Azaria's character has acheived, and he  wonders if his wife longs for her former love.
Burt Reynolds is great as  a former hockey coach who refuses to help coach the Mystery team because of  personal issues.
