5970869,5,B00F98FOI6,"I pre-ordered this because I always want to ensure I see Altman releases on Criterion ASAP.  Glad I did.  I'll leave it to other reviewers to talk about the film itself.  I am inclined to review the Special section.
For instance you get the demos by Carradine for 2 of the songs he wrote for the film plus another song which was left out don'know why, They're great.  So are most of the other songs, all of which were written by the actors themselves.
Also included is a docuentary about making  Nashville.  The interviews with those involved are both enjoyable and educational.
You get 3 interviews with Altman himself.
I was a 21 year old junior in college in Boston in 1975 when this was released,  I was saddened by the haunting ending.  Now I'm 59.  Nashville gets the same response from me.  This film is relevant as ever.

5970870,5,B00F98FOI6,"A quick review of the new Criterion Blu-Ray release of the classic ""Nashville,"" considered among critics (and me) as one of the greatest films of the 70's.  If you a lover of film, you probably know the name ""Criterion,"" a company that specializes in taking noteworthy films and creating outstanding versions of them through film and audio restoration.  Let me state that I have all available versions of the film, including VHS, Lazer Disc and the original DVD transfer.  This release by Criterion is nothing short of amazing.  Many films from the 70's suffer from deterioration that is greater than other decades due to the type of film stock utilized and other factors. That is not the case with this transfer.  Criterion has created an almost pristine restoration from both a video and an audio standpoint, gaining access to the original magnetic audio tracks and creating a very nice 5.1 surround mix, not available on previous releases.  Although the mix lacks a little low end, my source at Criterion informs me that they could have sent a little more signal to the sub artificially, but they wanted to stay true to the original recordings.  They have done a superlative job establishing a surround audio field that sounds natural. I won't go into the extras that are reviewed here elsewhere.  Just know that if you love this film, you will treasure the manner in which Criterion has preserved Altman's masterwork. If you haven't seen it, by all means, buy this film and see one of the greatest films of the 70's, if not one of the greatest of all time.",1386633600,8,1560,4.773234200743494
5970871,5,B00F98FOI6,"This is one of my all-time favorite films, and I've always hoped Criterion would choose it as a release.  They finally did.  The DVD is magnificently presented, along with a commentary by Altman, home movies of the production, three interviews with Altman, and a long ""making of"" documentary. Criterion has done an incredible job remastering it. Altman made some great films - he also made a number of not-so-great ones - but ""Nashville"" ranks as an American classic.  The ""hazy"" look in his movies made for terrrible transfers to VHS and DVD's... the picture has been sharpened and the contrast heightened, and it looks better than I ever recall it looking onscreen.",1386288000,3,667,4.9375
5970872,5,B00F98FOI6,"This new Blu-Ray transfer of Nashville looks fantastic. The folks at Criterion should be commended for the excellent work on this print, which has incredible detail while still retaining its filmic look.

Ported over from the Paramount DVD is an audio commentary by director Robert Altman. He points out that the cast wrote most of the songs for their respective characters. All of the songs were done in-house and when Nashville came out, local musicians hated them. He mentions the numerous collaborators he worked with in front of and behind the camera and explains what they contributed to the film. Altman talks about his approach to filmmaking on this engaging and informative track.

Also included is a fantastic theatrical trailer.

The Making of Nashville features various cast and crew members recounting their roles in this film and what they think of it now. They talk about getting involved in the project and their impressions of Altman. The likes of Keith Carradine, Lily Tomlin and Michael Murphy (among several others) tell fantastic filming anecdotes and address Altmans famous habit of encouraging improvisation among the cast.

Robert Altmans Interviews include one from 1975 when Nashville was released and he talks about the films origins and how hard it was to get made. Theres another from 2000 where he talks about various cast members and their characters. The third one is from 2002 and Altman points out how Nashville was the first big film where he had complete creative control.

There is Behind the Scenes footage of the opening traffic jam scene and the final one. Its pretty grainy and has no sound, but does provide a glimpse into Altmans working methods.

Finally, there is Keith Carradine Demo. Altman recorded three songs that the actor created fro the film in his office and you can listen to each one.",1386028800,10,1840,4.996732026143791
5970873,5,B00F98FOI6,"Having just again watched Nashville, I am floored by the brilliance of this film. Altman catches a season, an era and an attitude and most importantly, he does all of this while presenting a nuanced and insightful depiction of human beings in all of their striving, fatuous and self-centered glory. From the wonderfully wacky BBC reporter asking crushed, junkyard cars if they are trying to tell her something, to the dance of the veil being momentarily pulled from the eyes of the off-keyed Sueleen, the film presents scene after scene of comedic pathos.

This is also a film, to a great degree, about women and the roles that women are asked to play out in our culture. The fragile and broken dove, the second in line, the sweet and never complaining wife are several of the many female roles depicted. The women who act the scenes out rise above and slap away the grubby and grasping hands of the men around them. Even the shape shifting Shelly Duvall in the role of Martha uses her female abilities to always move ahead.

A must-see film for all. It will change the way you look at film forever.",1382832000,3,1099,4.6020408163265305
5970874,5,B00F98FOI6,"Is NASHVILLE Robert Altman's greatest work? When you have a maverick filmmaker like Altman, who has a unique sensibility, which leads to unique films -- M*A*S*H, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Quintet, Short Cuts, Three Women, Cookie's Fortune -- and the list goes on and on, how do you choose a ""greatest?"" His films are ground-breaking, entertaining, poignant, and always incredibly photographed and acted. NASHVILLE is certainly up there -- one of the top five, and one of the most haunting. It's stayed with me all the years since I saw it during its premiere run in New York.

Criterion is the best video label in the U.S., and buying/owning their disks is my biggest vice (since I periodically ignore my bank account to do so). The fact that Criterion has chosen NASHVILLE is both fitting and exciting news. It's a natural for their collection. I'll be one of the first on line to buy it, and am looking forward to the bonus materials as well.

I note with strong interest that NASHVILLE, along with a couple of other releases coming in December, will be released in dual-format DVD and Blu-Ray editions -- a change in policy at Criterion. Although it raises the price point a bit, I think it's a good idea for someone like me who doesn't have a Blu-Ray player but is always just about to buy one. All my Criterions (about 100) are in DVD, but NASHVILLE is one of those releases that makes me feel like it's time to upgrade. I'm personally glad I don't have to choose DVD (current) versus Blu-Ray (near future) and pay all that money again if I want to upgrade certain disks. I assume Criterion will be doing dual-format releases with everything new from this point on . . . and that's fine with me.",1382313600,17,1698,4.582236842105263
5970875,5,B00F98FOI6,Nashville is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and it was born in the midst of America's most remarkable period of filmmaking. I know little about the city of Nashville or country music and I loved this film. It's far bigger and more universal than country music so don't let that keep you from experiencing something very special.,1382140800,3,338,4.65
5970876,5,B00F98FOI6,"As have others, I too am excited beyond belief that Criterion is honoring NASHVILLE to be part of its series.  I will never forget when I first saw the film in New York City. I was stunned by it and stood in line a second and third time. It became one of the most astonishing metaphors of our political climate at the time.  The film, created in Altman's improvisational style, is flooded with truthful work: Lily Tomlin, Keith Carradine, Ronee Blakley, Henry Gibson, Shelley Duvall, Geraldine Chaplin, Karen Black, Ned Beatty, and the list goes on --- all contributed enormously to the mosaic.  With echoes of the Kennedy assassination, the film marches on as a panorama of the sixties. The film almost ridicules Nashville and I can understand why the country capital was not celebrating its perspective The plot occurs in five days with intertwining story lines and the Grand Ole Opry as a backdrop. The finale is a political rally for one Hal Philip Walker, a radical conservative, a kind of Ted Cruz candidate, who we never see, but who's presence is always felt. His 'appearance' at the end is symbolized by a black limo surrounded by men in dark suits.  It is very eerie and, we sense, not good for America. With this incredible work, Altman paints a haunting vision for our country's future that makes one weep for our fore fathers.  This is a kind of Requiem Mass to the powerful climax that makes it almost without equal.  The film feels like an accident which is part of its delight.  But really --- it is a calculated vision by one of America's most misunderstood directors.  Robert Altman is a 'genius' and I do not use that word without it being earned.  My favorite moment?  Oh, there are many.  Gwen Welles sad striptease, the long shot of Ms Tomlin's lost face as she hears Carradine sing ""I'm Easy,"" the Oscar winning song.  The film also won the Oscar for best Original Score, each actor writing his/her own songs, an astonishing feat!  Should we discuss Altman's sense of risk taking or collaboration?  Do your film collection a favor and buy NASHVILLE.  I hope that Criterion has recent interviews with cast members. The great Pauline Kael, the Moses of film critics, called the film, ""The funniest epic vision of America ever to reach the screen."" I did not sense Altman's humor as much as I felt his sadness. But, it is the kind of film, that creates another more personal film is those who witness it.  I hope that Criterion dissects the Altman process.  I would be interested to know how much of a script the actors received since Altman was very secretive about this project.  Do I sound excited?  Yes.  I cannot wait to watch this film again, as only Criterion can do it right.  I hope that they don't disappoint us.  --Robert Brewer",1380326400,28,2759,4.645360824742268
5970887,5,B00F98FOI6,"A poetic indictment of country music at the time. Notice how all of the bad music was played by the elite ""Stars"" and all of the good stuff was played in the local bars and clubs.",1446595200,,179,4.0
5970888,5,B00F98FOI6,Brilliant performances and great musical interludes take us on a tour of the music scene as well as the political.  Shows how far a good country music performer can get people elected this side of the Mason and Dixon line.,1438992000,,222,4.55
5970889,5,B00F98FOI6,"Brilliant, funny, sad and epic look at 1970s America, following 24 characters over a few key days in Nashville. An amazing combination of political satire, hysterical send up of the country music business and touching and moving character studies.

If one wants to quibble there are minor flaws; overstated performances at moments, ironies that are a bit too easy, but the overall sweep, power, the great performances and the sheer number of moments that make you want to laugh and cry simultaneously, are overwhelming.

Certainly one of the great films of the 70s, and arguably among the greatest American films ever made, I think this is the film Altman will be remembered for 100 years from now, the pinnacle of his semi-improvistory, humanistic style.

Thanks to Criterion (and Masters of Cinema in the UK) for finally giving this the kind of loving treatment it deserved.  It was bizarre that for so many years this was only available on a mediocre DVD, but between the terrific new transfer to blu-ray, and a bunch of incisive and entertaining special features this portrait of who we were as a nation (that still has a lot to tell us about who we are today) gets a release that does it justice.

If you know and love Nashville, you owe yourself the upgrade.  And if you don't know Nashville, and have any serious interest in films now's the chance to get to see it right.",1436486400,,1378,4.720833333333333

5970894,3,B00F98FOI6,"The movie is a little slow for me.  I do really like the song ""I'm Easy"" that Keith Carradine sings in the movie.  The Bicentennial buildup and all the
hoopla of America and country music upstarts and the old establishment musicians like the one played excellently by Gibson are fairly interesting,

5970895,5,B00F98FOI6,"Wow. You always hear ""You gotta see Nashville"" or ""I love Altman, but I really loved Nashville."" Now I know. I watched this as part of a self programmed triple feature which I recommend. ""Bob Dylan: Don't Look Back,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" and then ending which ""Nashville."" These three movies take you on the rise and fall of the 1960s. My boyfriend and I read Joan Didion's ""The White Album"" that weekend as well just to properly frame it all. This was a totally random scenario, but it all fell into place perfectly. It started out with us randomly deciding to watch Madonna's ""Truth or Dare,"" which is so much less horrible that I had prepared myself for. During which I kept saying, they are doing the 'Don't Look Back' thing. It was painting by the numbers, and yet it felt like great homage should. So I said, let's watch ""Don't Look Back"" just to be sure. Then news came in that Al Maysles died. So the next day we watched ""Gimme Shelter."" It is a haunting non-sequel to the Dylan film. Historically and socially the films work in sequence. ""Nashville"" then became another unintentional step in a perfect sequence. Which plays like a call and response to the previous films. Anyways, this isn't a review, just an account of a great weekend capped off by ""Nashville.""",1426636800,,1268,4.615044247787611

One rainy night, it occurred to me that I still had not watched my gift blu-ray of Nashville. I enthusiastically unpacked the disc and settled back for a great viewing experience! An hour later, I was still trying to understand the point of the film. The characters with the most development were not likable (at least, not to me), the music seemed like it was satirizing Country Music and the rest of the incoherent cast of thousands just went by in a blur. I kept asking myself, what was the point of it all. It did not seem realistic enough to be making any social comment... I realized that this was one of the least entertaining 'masterpieces' that I have ever pulled the plug on. I have read other reviews and many said something like, you either get it (whatever that is) or you don't -- I am in the latter category!",1412294400,3,976,4.392265193370166
5970901,5,B00F98FOI6,"I don't know if BluRay adds to the simplicity of the profound film achievement, but I'm so glad to have it in my collection.
Brilliant acting, superb editing, carrying the multi-plot devices that Altman is known for, and a somewhat improvised screenplay by Joan Tewkesbury, all add up to one of my absolute favorite films. If I had to pick favorite actors, they would be Keenan Wynn and Barbara Harris. It's also notable that Keith Carradine's Oscar-winning song, ""I'm Easy"", plays an integral part of the drama. Most Oscar songs are simply ""thrown in"", or played over credits. Carradine's song has a tension and power that most don't realize.

The beauty and poetry of Altman's direction is how he can find dozens of characters and, somehow, make all their lives interact. He brought this idea to perfection in the brilliant ""Short Cuts"".

I LOVE this film, and the great Altman.",1409443200,,880,4.86
5970902,4,B00F98FOI6,This mastering of the film is the best that's ever been available. But making the Blu-Ray and the DVD available as one package is a ripoff. You should be able to purchase each on their own.,1403395200,2,189,4.277777777777778
5970903,5,B00F98FOI6,"He didn't get much love from hollywood but Altman was clearly way ahead of his time. Amazing ensemble here and a great film about America. I will leave anything based on story up to other reviewers. This is one of the first major large ensemble productions from Altman that many imitate today.

The Criterion bitrate is a tad low at about 23Mbps. For this 2.35: 1 ratio, though, I suppose it isn't too bad, but the Euro release does look sharper and with more resolved grain. That another version, from Masters of Cinema region B, exists with basically the same transfer and 30+ Mbps bitrate. More bitrate is always welcome, but for smaller screens the Criterion encode does look to be a solid job. Really, all you can tell is that it has less grain if you are watching on 40 or less inches. The detail is still present and fairly sharp.

To me Criterion is doing pretty good compression jobs these days, better than the first few years anyway. This one looks to have been done right, and the wide aspect ratio also helps the bitrate keep up no doubt.

Not really sure how I feel about getting DVDs as I have absolutely no use for them. The packaging is digipack style, different from most of my Criterion collection as well. What the Criterion has over the other releases is extras and you will not be disappointed. This one is jam packed with stuff. All in all a really great package.",1399852800,,1386,4.492063492063492
5970904,5,B00F98FOI6,"One of a kind and one of the most outstanding films of the seventies, this is Robert Altman's masterwork.  A truly great film that has not diminished over the years.  Makes me feel rather old when I realize I first saw this in Melbourne  just on forty years ago; one of a few because the film was bumped after a disastrous three day run in  a first-run cinema! I think a lot of locals thought it was a film about C & W music and didn't recognize the performers.  A pity because this is a brilliant social and political drama with an unforgettable ensemble of actors.  Just about everyone could have received an Oscar nomination but special nods should go to Lily Tomlin, Barbara Harris, Henry Gibson and Ronee Blakley. A truly remarkable achievement and best of all, an important American film.

5970905,5,B00F98FOI6,"Nashville is probably my favorite film which is why I gave this disc 5 stars.

The blu-ray looks great and for that I'm grateful, but the 5.1 mix is truly vile.  One of the worse I have ever heard.  I don't know who the tin ears are you did this mix, but they should be seeking other career opportunities.  The sound is hollow and shrill with excessive reverb.  It's tolerable during dialogue scenes, but the musical numbers sound terrible.  The only way it became listenable was by hitting the stereo switch on my receiver.

I don't want to discourage anyone from watching and enjoying this movie, but I care enough about it that I felt I had to say something about the crappy sound mix.  This is a great movie.  I first saw it in a sneak preview in Boston some weeks before it's official opening.  I can honestly say that I felt like I had never seen anything like it.  I kept going back to see it again and for months afterwards most other movies seemed trivial and dull.  This is a film with so much going on that even after all these years I find there are still little pleasures to discover that I haven't previously noticed.",1396224000,4,1131,4.358851674641149

5970908,5,B00F98FOI6,"It's been some months since I've had good reason to use my Blu Ray player, but if there's an occasion that would move me to fire up the machine, it's the release of Altman's singular masterpiece in a high-def format.  From the outset, I must caution fans of the movie--especially those who, like me, are already sitting on the double VHS version and the subsequent DVD edition--not to over-elevate expectations.  This latest edition strikes me as occasionally grainy and overly dark, especially for the interior shots, and the sound doesn't seem as open and crisp as Altman's more recent ""Gosford Park,"" which I recently had occasion to re-screen.  In fact, the present edition is making me all too aware of some ""dated"" qualities about ""Nashville"" that may require me to reconsider my conviction, ever since its release, that ""Nashville"" eclipses even ""Citizen Kane"" as American cinema's crowning achievement.  But, first, the case for ""Nashville"" (freshly written in 2014):

It was the summer of 1975, and the buzz was all about two films: ""Jaws"" and ""Nashville.""  The former was an entertaining afternoon at the movies; the latter, which delivered disappointing numbers at the box office, was an experience that left me shaken for days after.  I returned to ""live"" in this cinematic Nashville two additional times within the first two weeks of the film's opening in Boston.  Each time was more instructive, revealing critical details of the film that I had missed and teaching me more about the ethos of the disco-crazed / country-western American culture of the 1970s.

Today's younger audiences are unlikely to recognize themselves in Altman's 1975 microcosmic criticism of life.  In fact, the characters' dialog and and dress are likely to strike many of today's viewers as almost ""cartoonish.""  But as the former owner of several light-colored leisure suits with flared pants legs, I can attest that the film is dead accurate in its portrayal of the era, its style and tastes.  Nashville was the new ""Hollywood"" of America, with hundreds of wannabe recording stars coming to this Mecca every day--and just as many leaving disillusioned.  Music had completely severed its ties to the ""Great American Songbook"" of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, George Gershwin, and Richard Rodgers.  Frank Sinatra had gone into retirement and simply stopped making records (before coming back after a wise decision to focus exclusively on ""live"" concerts).  But for most fans of the America's new popular music, there was no longer a separation between the professional composer and the performer.  Everyone was a potential composer-performer, with reductive or prosaic tunes like ""Little Green Apples"" and ""Gentle on My Mind"" becoming the new chartbusters while shows like ""Hee Haw,"" ""Glen Campbell Hour,"" and ""Sonny and Cher"" were the prime-time favorites of America's television viewers.

Younger viewers of the film simply must try not to get hung up on the ""period piece"" aspects of the film and be open to the film's undeniable resonance with today's ""Nashville mentality""--a culture with many ""proud Tea-Party"" Americans; Fox News ""addicts,"" Glenn Beck/Ted Nugent followers; ""hillbilly-themed"" shows on cable TV; a fixation on cars and guns; a right-wing suspicion of, and political bias against, ""the government.""  And, as if further proof were needed of the ""rightness"" of Altman's vision,  country music (a multi-billion dollar industry) is now so prevalent in virtually ALL popular music that we scarcely take note of it.  A pessimist might observe that as a society we've moved too deep in Plato's allegorical ""cave"" (configured like a modern day movie theater) to see the light of day.  Altman's camera, however, will suggest otherwise in the film's suddenly calm and quiet, reflective yet ""prospective,"" final shot (the most memorable example of Altman's long takes with an uninterrupted moving camera).

Almost 40 years later, Altman's vision has not simply ""proven out,"" but it remains equally relevant to our own lives and future. The stunning ending of ""Nashville"" at the New World's Parthenon (an exact replica were it made of marble instead of cement) must still provoke the viewer to question the meaning--of being an American;  of celebrity worship and the American Dream; of attachment to ephemeral machines like the automobile; of the ""democratization"" of music-making; of our ephemeral attachments to celebrities and inattention to causes like the plight of the poor; of the narcissism that is the basis of adulterous ""relationships""; of a populace that hears less than the deaf children of Lily Tomlin's character and that lacks, above all, self-reflection much less ""vision.""

[Warning: This paragraph contains a ""spoiler""]: Altman's film is, in sum, a criticism of the unexamined life, a stinging slap in the face of those who base their likes and dislikes, or their very identity, on slogans and bumperstickers, on status and power, on abundant rather than ""sufficient"" wealth, on superficial pleasures and the ""denial of death.""  Kenny, the loner with the violin case who is intermittently shown enjoying his personal adventure away from his mother in tinsel town, does not come to the political rally at the Parthenon to assassinate the country music diva, Barbara Jean, the country queen so unforgettably played by Ronee Blakey.  His shooting of her is an impulsive act, motivated by a Freudian desire to destroy the maternal Oedipal ties that have thwarted his growth.  Ironically, he may be the most thoughtful, introspective character in the entire film.

But there are no villains.  The poignant final tilt shot of a camera moving from the mayhem on stage up to the American flag and from there to the unobstructed skies is a poignant reminder of the genuine freedom that, though elusive, is still there for the people of the United States of America, despite the narrow-minded self-interest and the thoughtless pettiness that prevent us from realizing the dream of a harmonious melting pot in which each individual is equally respected for his potential but also for his unique character and contribution.

Robert Altman was, at his best, a ""critic"" and a ""visionary,"" and he was also a gifted but radically independent filmmaker who refused to be guided by either money or celebrity.  If he was underrappreciated by movie-goers despite his prolific legacy, it's because he refused ""to tell stories"" or to entrust his message to a familiar ""star.""  Rather, he used the medium to provide us with all of the material needed to create stories thaat would otherwise be too big and urgent to fit into the usual formulaic scripts use by honored, more famous and wealthy, contemporaries like Scorsese, Spielberg, Coppola.  All of them, worthy ""story-tellers.""  By contrast, Altman was a ""maker see.""  He shows us Nashville's actual ""life""--not a frozen,  documentary-like a tabloid imitation--but a dynamic, vital, unfolding moment in time that connects with our own.  Yet ultimately he leaves it to the viewer to put these rich and fruitful, provocative and ""meaning-full,"" pieces together until, along with a narrative that makes sense, we experience an ""epiphany"" about our own place in the stories within Altman's brilliant images and scenes.

The foregoing is merely a beginning attempt at an introduction to Robert Altman and, more importantly, a guide through ""Nashville."" The film references three major areas of American experience--the political, religious, and entertainment worlds.  It includes the young and the old, the healthy and the sick, the military and the anti-social.  Humor abounds in the film, yet Altman seems to have sympathy for all of his 20+ characters.  No one can watch the film without taking away an indelible moment, whether it be Geraldine Chaplin's meditation on rusty old cars in an auto graveyard or Ronee Blakey's deeply affecting performance of the country song-waltz ""Dues"" (uncredited in the present Blu Ray packaging), just prior to her break-down on stage.  And for some of us the film has become so completely lodged in consciousness that it seems to replay itself practically every day of our lives.

If I had to settle on one film in my collection, it would still be ""Nashville,"" which has a further and deeper-reaching resonance, at least for this viewer, than any other film of any nationality.  At the same time, nothing can replace the experience of viewing it in a large theater in 1975--not even a print superior to the present one.  Curiously, the makers have included the ordinary DVD version that preceded this Blu Ray edition, for a total of 3 discs.  The Blu Ray is less grainy than the DVD version and the sound is clearer (always a consideration because of Altman's frequent use of multiple, overlapping dialog).  Although the film should be seen in its original ratio, I can't help myself:  I keep zooming to a ratio that fills my screen, the better to see my favorite moments and characters. (Why Ronee Blakey didn't become a huge star after a stunning performance captured by Altman's enrapt, steady camera still eludes me.)  Perhaps I finally have sufficient reason to look into one of those 50""-60"" mammoth TV sets with 5:1 surround sound.  That's probably what the residents of ""Nashville"" would do. (Mindful of the possible offense to the citizens of Nashvile that was registered by film reviewers like Rex Reed, I use quote marks to clarify that my comments are of Altman's cinematic ""representation,"" or ""interpretation"" of Nashville and not of the proud city itself.)

Days, and now decades, after viewing this film, other spectators have dismissed it as ""confusing,"" ""weird,"" ""patronizing"" more often than they've agreed with me about the film's power, universal imaginative vision, and permanent hold.  But I'll continue to defend the movie, which even now leaves chills and conflicting but very real emotions about life in America in the 21st century.  Most importantly, it's movie-making at its extemporaneous, least-contrived, most candid and honest best. Even as Hollywood continues to grind out the same cookie-cutter scripts with a twist or two (I'm just as happy not to have met ""The Fockers,"" and only Robin Williams' performance in Altman's ""Pop-Eye"" helps make up for the offensive ""Patch Adams""), ""Nashville"" is a reminder of one of cinema's most shining moments.  It's also a challenge to any young talent who is not overcome by the smell of money to think like this deceptively gentle and soft-spoken, seemingly casual man who was also a radical, courageous filmmaker, a creative artist not afraid to ""hold up the mirror"" to the world as he saw it.  In spite of a few bombs (e.g. ""Pret-a-Porter,"" a sophomoric, overstated attempt to satirize the world of fashion), Altman was the medium's Shakespeare, realizing the potential of film not merely to entertain but to enable us, above all, ""to see.""  God bless Robert Altman.

CODA: As a musician, I'm especially attentive to film scores.  Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" and, above all, Hitchock's ""Vertigo"" would not register such profound impacts upon the viewer without the scores provided by Bernard Herrmann.  ""Nashville,"" on the other hand, is a film without a traditional score, so true to its times that it relies solely upon ""source music,"" or the characters themselves to provide the film's score.  The music comes from both musicians and non-musician characters in the film, gradually rising to the level of a collective chorus being sung by the people themselves.  It  expresses their heartaches and dreams, their disappointments and yearnings, their fears and the lies they tell themselves in order to cope.  And the music is as accessible as it is omnipresent, so contagious and insistent that we find ourselves sharing in its ownership, like Henry Gibson's character becoming caught up in the melodic strains that urge us, as a community of good Americans, simply, to ""Keep A-Goin'.""

Yet Altman's challenge to the viewer is not to allow these intoxicating strains to cloud judgment concerning complex problems that simply can't be solved by the lyrics of a country song or any other form of avoidance and denial:

""It don't worry me; / It don't worry me.
""You may say that I ain't free, / But it don't worry me.""

Spectators who have been fully engaged by the film's chronology (a visit of only 3 days, which heightens the film's immediacy) are, at least initially, likely to join the people of Nashville in their song, carried along by the musical strains without a thought to the words. The lyrics of this ""choral finale,"" sung at the replica of the Greek Parthenon, would seem to fit perfectly in a modernist poem like T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" or the widely-taught ""The Love Song of J. Afred Prufrock,"" in which the monologist offers a mock-heroic challenge--""Let us go ... to an overwhelming question... Let us make a visit...Oh, do not ask what is it.""  Prufrock just as quickly backs down, dodging ""all"" questions, lamenting that ""the mermaids will not sing to me."" The people of Nashville at least ""Keep A'Goin'"" but with little thought to their destination.  As spectators, we're left to ask the tough questions even as we leave the film with the fading strains of music still ringing in our minds.  The present edition includes legendary film critic Pauline Kael's insightful review of ""Nashville,"" which she entitles ""America Singing.""  Enduring art--whether jazz, poetry, or film--is like music, or a melody that never wears out its welcome and never ceases to invite our participation. In that respect, ""Nashville"" rises to the level of timeless lyric art.",1389830400,30,13629,5.127428829643018

5970912,5,B00F98FOI6,"A rich, towering kaleidoscope that weaves the stories of twenty-four characters into one grand epic, ""Nashville"" is one of the best and best-loved American movies of the 1970s. The pinnacle of not only Robert Altman's career, but also the New Hollywood movement that crystallized that decade, ""Nashville"" has everything a good movie should have: memorable characters, strong themes, relevant political subtext, high entertainment value, a seamless blend of drama and comedy and, of course, unforgettable music. What it DIDN'T have was a DVD/Blu-Ray that did the movie justice. When it came out on DVD by Paramount, the movie was given an extremely weak presentation. It was too dark, the colors looked muted and the audio quality was strongly uneven. As a pivotal movie from an illustrious period and one that was instrumental to the advancement of narrative and sound, ""Nashville"" was a movie that deserved better treatment.

That's why The Criterion release of ""Nashville"" is a cause for celebration. After having been forced to watch ""Nashville"" in its unimpressive Paramount DVD, watching ""Nashville"" on the Criterion Blu-Ray is like seeing a new movie come to life. The 2K restoration of the picture is absolutely spectacular and the remastered sound now makes you feel like you're in the presence of the performers, especially if you have strong speakers. When Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) records his jingoistic ""200 Years"" track in the music studio, you feel like you're in that studio as he sings. Listening to Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakely) perform her songs at the Opryland USA park is like sitting in the stands watching her sing. ""Nashville"" was shot with each of the actors having mobile mikes, creating a different approach in sound recording that has become trend today. That wasn't noticeable in the clunky Paramount DVD, but the Criterion edition makes it palpable. In the end, ""Nashville"" has never looked AND sounded good until now.

In addition to its marvelous picture and audio quality, ""Nashville"" also has the privilege of being presented with supplements that honors the movie's legacy and importance. There's an insightful one hour-plus documentary on the making of the movie featuring many of the cast and crew members that worked on the movie. You also get to see behind-the-scenes footage of how the movie was shot and an enjoyable demo of Keith Carradine performing a song. As an added bonus, all the extras that were in the Paramount DVD (including Altman's audio commentary) are added here as well. Best of all, ""Nashville"" is one of the first Criterion movies to be released in a dual Blu-Ray/DVD format, meaning that you can get the Blu-Ray AND the DVD discs at the same time. In contrast to the disappointing ""Heaven's Gate"" release, Criterion really pulled out all the stops in distributing this marvelous movie.

And what about the movie itself? The movie remains a landmark in American cinema, a stunning masterwork that rivals ""Taxi Driver"" and the two ""Godfather"" movies as amongst the best and most influential movies of the 70s. Many movies of the 70s have become dated and forgotten in cinema history. ""Nashville"" is one of the movies that gets better with age. With its hugely successful blend of political ambition, strong satire and outstanding characterization, ""Nashville"" seems more relevant today than it did back in 1975.

Everybody who loves ""Nashville"" remembers the characters - the delicate, vulnerable country singer (Barbara Jean) and her controlling husband (Allen Garfield); the pompous but ultimately caring Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) and his grating companion Lady Pearl (Barbara Baxley); the good-hearted but tragically tone-deaf singer (Gwen Welles) who aspires to be the next country star; Barbara Jean's popular but supremely mediocre rival Connie White (Karen Black); the dysfunction country trio (Keith Carradine, Allan F. Nicholls, Cristina Raines); the obnoxious BBC reporter and comic-relief Opal (Geraldine Chaplin); Linnea Reese, the gospel singer who has the misfortune of marrying her deceitful husband Delbert (Ned Beatty) and mothering two deaf children; the lonely uncle Mr. Green (Kenneth Wynn), who tries to get his heartless niece/groupie Martha (Shelley Duvall) to talk to her aunt; and last but not least, Winifred (or Albuquerque in the movie credits), played with child-like innocence by Barbara Harris, who is denied a chance to prove her talents but winds up being a factor to rise people's spirits in the movie's climatic sequence. And there's still more characters that I haven't mention.

These characters are not simplistic stereotypes or stock characters; they are real people. These characters have emotional depth and they inhibit human strengths and weaknesses that make them identifiable. In the movie's most famous sequence, when the womanizer Tom Frank (Keith Carradine) performs ""I'm Easy"", Altman cuts close-ups to the faces of most of the movie's female characters' whom Frank had established a relationship with. Even though Frank is singing for Linnea Reese, we see the rest of women in awe, believing that the song was meant for them. It's a beautiful sequence that is simultaneously funny and believable because how many women have had someone sing for them, only to find out it was not the case? Gwen Welles' character initially begins as a sweet but naive singer clueless of her limited talent but in the end, when she is forced to not only be stripteased but be denied the spotlight that was promised to her, there's a sense of pathos. In the beginning, you laugh at her, but in the end, you feel bad for this innocent character.

That's what makes ""Nashville"" a great movie - the movie, for all its politics and satire, is about the characters. As the movie develops, so do the characters. They deceive, they have affairs, they disrespect and bully, but in the end, they do the best they can to survive and succeed. And in the pivotal Parthenon concert, when tragedy strikes, characters we thought we knew wind up taking us by surprise. This powerful tapestry of comedy, tragedy, musical and satire hits us because we've not only become attached to the characters, but we ARE those characters in real life.

""Nashville"" is one of those great movies that leave you with an emotional high, a feeling of discovery and elation rarely seen in American movies today. For many years, ""Nashville"" was only available in the mediocre Paramount DVD. Thankfully, Criterion has righted all the wrongs and presented ""Nashville"" in the best picture and audio quality possible, breathing new life and bringing more audience to this cinematic treasure. Don't miss out on this indispensable American classic.

5970915,5,B00F98FOI6,"This movie is the ultimate Altman,  a kaleidoscope of 24 eccentric,  fully drawn, oddballs, going about their lives in the weekend's time in mid a 70's  version of the Country-Western capital.  Hilarious, complex, innovative, and amazingly well acted.  So, it's a modern GRAND HOTEL, times five, and told in modern terms; each of the characters  is just dropped into the story with no elaborate exposition. Although this technique has become almost cliched in the 38 years since its debut (think of the structure of PULP FICTION, which is just a rip-off of NASHVILLE with blood and coarse language instead of parody c-w music,) the original is still a landmark. It's one of those movies that come along and are so different that they make changes in the way we perceive movies , like SUNSET BLVD. or BONNIE AND CLYDE, two films that were way out-of-step with normal Hollywood pictures at the time of their release and became classics that influenced everything afterward.
One of my top-ten movies, along with SHORT CUTS, Altman's '93 re-do, in LA, with an even bigger, more exotic cast of loons.  Both of them are cut form the same rare, elaborate, highly-colored cloth and are essential for your wardrobe, if you have an attention span that can stand the challenge of the style.
The new Criterion repressing is vastly superior to the earlier Paramount release, with the same commentary track as before, but a wonderful making-of documentary with cast members and production people. The colors are wonderful, and the sandpaper grain that was present in the theatres (and i saw it five times when it was in release) has been sanded down, very nicely, except for the first few frames of the titles, which are supposed to look well-worn.

Altman knew the conservative and backwoods and backwards version of Nashville was the nearest version of truth ever presented in film in the 70's and beyond. The politics have not changed since the 70's vision ...Not only in the country music industry...but also the right wing politics of today. Republicans continue to rule the airwaves on AM and FM radio across the God Bless America Landscape. Altman used the best talent available to entertain his audience and reach across the airwaves to communicate his message of truth and the real American Way.
Country music needs a real shake up. As the rest of the country, stuck in the dark ages. Wake UP America.
Altman would love the treatment of his masterpiece if he could see this wonderful Criterion Collection revision. The picture quality is high quality as always with Criterion. Beautiful Blue-Ray treatment and great extras. ENJOY.",1387238400,2,957,5.0251572327044025

8613291,5,B00F98FOI6,"With a presidential election upon us, I thought Id take a spin watching this brilliant Robert Altman film again.  It not only has some elements of politics, but an assassination and gun violence have key parts in the movie.  Altman actually came upon this movie somewhat by accident.  Based on a thin script provided by United Artists, he agreed to do it if they would distribute Thieves Like Us which he wanted to shoot in Mississippi.  Once he finished that film, he started on Nashville, in Nashville using a journal kept by his screenwriter, Joan Tewkesbury when she visited the city.

The film was unique in many ways including the casting.  Altman assembled a couple dozen actors, most not well known.  There is no lead or star, and each have important roles in the story.  Karen Black, as country singing star Connie White, was probably the best known actor at the time and Lily Tomlin, perhaps the most recognizable from her TV comedy routines.  Tomlin actually was a last minute replacement for Louise Fletcher, and earned an Oscar nomination for her performance.

Im not telling much in the way of a plot here, because frankly there isn't much of one.  The film offers a collision of characters set during a political campaign that involved a third party candidate who had surprised everyone by winning 3 primaries.  His platform included replacing the National Anthem with something people can sing and understand.  He also wanted to tax churches and prohibit lawyers from serving in Congress.  Sounded crazy at the time, but not so much now.  Michael Murphy plays John Triplette who is organizing a fund raiser for the candidate and country singers are the main attraction.

Altman and his sound guys (Jim Webb and Chris McLaughlin) placed mics on each of the 24 actors and used the various dialog, often together and over each other at times.  Altman and cinematographer, Paul Lohmann, also used long lens shots.  Like with the sound, the actors were never quite sure when they were going to be used in the final product, so stayed in character.  It was very effective.  We are led from scene to scene usually by 2 characters.  Sometimes it is the silent (no dialog) Tricycle Man played by Jeff Goldblum, an amateur magician.  Other times it is Opal (Geraldine Chaplin), who claims to be a BBC reporter making a documentary.  Shes always chatty and seems to be present more often than not.

Altman provides a few hints as to what will become a shocking final scene.  Lady Pearl (Barbara Baxley) is the wife of the king of country music, Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson).  Haven is singer whose songs revel in patriotism and who wears a white jump-suit adorned with rhinestones, topped off with a two-toned wig.  Lady Pearl had worked for JFK and Bobby Kennedy and laments their early deaths.  Opal seems to love being in America and makes a second hand comment about all of the guns she sees.  She say something to the effect that, while the gun toters seem like normal people, wouldnt it be easy for someone on the fringe to acquire one.  Prescient of the films conclusion and still relevant some 41 years later.

There are a couple scenes worth highlighting.  One involves the womanizing folk-rock singer, Tom Frank (Keith Carradine).  Hes part of a trio consisting of Bud (Dave Peel) and Mary (Cristina Raines).  Bud and Mary are married, but Mary is sleeping with Tom.  Tom also has one night stands with Opal and skitzy L. A. Joan (Shelley Duvall), in town to see her dying aunt.  But hes also bedding Linnea (Tomlin) who is a lead singer of a black gospel choir and the mother of 2 deaf children.  In an emotional scene which takes place in a rowdy night club that becomes eerily quiet, Tom dedicates a song he just wrote (Oscar winner, Im Easy) to someone in the audience.  The camera closes in on the faces of Mary, then Opal, then Joan who offer slight smiles, clearly thinking hes singing about them.  But as the song continues, Tom focuses his eyes on the back of the room where Linnea is sitting.  Quite a scene.

Another is at the very end.  As the career of the queen of country music, Barbara Jean (Oscar nominee Ronee Blakley) is perhaps coming to an end, another rises.  Throughout the film a character called Albuquerque (Barbara Harris) drifts in and out of scenes.  With a short skirt, and torn nylons, shes usually drunk and appears to be just another star struck voyeur.  But during the chaos she picks up a microphone and begins singing It Dont Worry Me, another song written by Carradine.  And the girl can sing!

Speaking of which, all of the actors did all their own singing and did it live.  Altman believed it would be more authentic.  It is.  Not only that but most of the songs were written by the cast and usually by the actors who would perform them.  There are too many actors to mention, but this is a great ensemble performance and one of the best movies to ever hit the screen.  A shrewd satire and highly recommended.

I also recommend the Criterion Blu ray collection package.  The film includes a Blu ray version, a DVD version and a second DVD which has the supplements.  The Blu ray includes a new documentary of the film as well.  The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  Without getting into the technical aspects of the transfer (included in an accompany booklet), the film looks as good as it ever has.  I have nothing on hand to compare it to but I could find no annoying elements worth noting.  The picture is clean and clear if a bit dull at times.  Really, it is very easy to watch.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is also excellent.  This is quite an accomplishment given the variety of musical settings.  Sometimes in a studio, then in a noisy club, then outside.  No hiss, dropouts or other issues.  Clear and crisp dialog.  In addition to the documentary, there are 3 separate Altman interviews, some soundless Behind the Scenes footage, Carradines song demos, a commentary track with Altman and the booklet featuring an essay by film critic Molly Haskell.  There is also an English SDH track.",1468195200,,6113,4.651401869158878
8613292,5,B00F98FOI6,"This has to be not only Robert Altman's best film but also one of the best of all time and now it's been given the Criterion treatment giving the sound quality a real boost in 5.1 surround DTS-HD MA and while the picture quality isn't perfect there isn't much wrong with it except for a few artifacts at the beginning and here and there but you'd have to really be looking out for them to pick them out.  The special features disc is also a treat with some very nice documentaries and interviews with Altman and some of the cast as well.  Some aspects of Altman's previous success, M*A*S*H, are carried over here like the use of the loudspeaker to move the action along as well as to provide comedic commentary throughout and like that socially conscious and anti-war film we get a similar almost documentary type film even to the extent of Geraldine Chaplin's character who is apparently making a BBC documentary about the Nashville scene involved in exposing the various levels of selfish exploitation and manipulation that goes on in society from the individual relationship to the relationship between the citizen and its government.  As any great film does this one rewards repeated viewing.
