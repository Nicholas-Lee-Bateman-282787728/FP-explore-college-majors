8760744,5,B01FGRB1F4,"Cathy Palmer's husband Kevin Palmer (James Staley) is the same type as the husband in ""Shirley Valentine"" (1989) and ""Enchanted April"" (1992). You know the kind. Not so much atrophied as just preoccupied with their business and own life that wives like Cathy (JoBeth Williams) become an after thought. However, as her husband says, ""The important thing kid is that you are doing something that you like to do"" as he nonchalantly brushes her off on his way out the door.
Naturally, Cathy's head is full of Rebecca Ryan novels and after winning a Rebecca Ryan writing contest she adds language skills needed for her trip to Europe.
This is where the story begins and I stop. I would like to describe more however, let us say that Cathy mysteriously disappears in Europe and Rebecca Ryan suddenly appears with Dimitri to fulfill her mission to save The Count.
Move over 007 here come Rebecca Ryan and she always gets her person.",1496620800,,925,4.751552795031056
