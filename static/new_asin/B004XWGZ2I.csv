8447511,5,B004XWGZ2I,"First rate screwball comedy, although it was reportedly neither a critical nor a commercial success in 1942.",1444348800,,108,5.411764705882353
8447512,3,B004XWGZ2I,"Irene Dunne was a talented, beautiful woman. Unfortunately, her character in this movie can't compare to her better screwball comedies, and the plot is so contrived that I grew weary of all the leading actors by the time heiress Jane Palmer (Dunne) decided she was in love with psychiatrist Enright (Patric Knowles).

Ralph Bellamy looked appropriately chagrined at his thankless role that called for warbling and wearing the most ridiculous cowboy duds on film. Knowles was almost 15 years younger than Dunne, and tries in vain to seem older and more staid. Only Queenie Vassar's performance as Dunne's grandmother kept me watching. She and the old gold miners have the best lines.

The screenplay tries to mock psychiatry, bankruptcy, wealthy women and scruffy Westerners with situations that make no sense and don't connect with each other. It has the same disjointed feel as ""Joy of Living"" (1938); buy it only if you must see everything Dunne has done.",1396396800,,957,5.050632911392405
8447513,5,B004XWGZ2I,"I was unaware of this Irene Dunne movie until I stumbled upon it as a recommendation. I immediately ordered it. Classic romantic screwball comedy with one of the greatest, underappreciated actresses of all times.",1372377600,4,212,5.264705882352941
8447514,3,B004XWGZ2I,"This Universal Vault DV-R is in excellent condition: the original material seems in good condition, and the transfer is fine and there were no problems with running the disc in my DVD player. But the movie itself...! It's too obviously a late (VERY late)  entry in the screwball comedy sweepstakes; unfortunately, Irene Dunne seems all wrong, she's too mature to be playing a dingbat debutante, and there's an essential sanity to her that makes her crazy antics seem worse than demented. (Irene Dunne was charming in her previous La Cava collaboration, UNFINISHED BUSINESS.) And the direction seems slack, with the gags seeming to be mistimed. It's sad to see La Cava, who was at the peak of his career a few years earlier (with MY MAN GODFREY and STAGE DOOR in 1936-37), winding down his career on this misfire.",1316304000,8,812,4.841726618705036
