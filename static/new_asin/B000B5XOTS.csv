2400708,4,B000B5XOTS,"On the first two disks there are a couple of episodes where the half the bar falls into darkness, i.e. alternating camera angles coincide with switching from a well lighted scene to a dimly lit scene. How did this happen? Regardless, if you own 6 seasons, you don't need anyone to comment on the content of the seventh. Just go buy it.",1137628800,7,335,4.419354838709677
2400709,5,B000B5XOTS,"I highly recommend this season of cheers.

Kirstie Alley is just terrific.

2400710,3,B000B5XOTS,"Cheers' original concept was the running plot: it was sort of a mix between a sitcom and a soap opera. In the Shelley Long era, the show delved deeply into the lives of its characters and really made you care about them. For example, in one of my favorite episodes, Don Juan is Hell (season 4), you actually feel sorry for Sam when he has to hear Diane's analysis (the episode is hilarious, but touching as well). In one of the first episodes ever, Coach has a very touching moment with his daughter.

However, once Rebecca joined the cast, those moments became farther and farther between. In her first season (season 6), Rebecca was almost human, although her ""love"" for Drake was really unbelievable (especially considering what a jerk he was). In this season, she's a completely unrealistic character and, furthermore, there's absolutely no chemistry with Sam whatsoever (aside from the ""definite maybe!"" moment). The rest of the cast is more wooden, too, with only Woody really eliciting anything close to a real emotion from the audience. All the others just exist to be made fun of or to crack one-liners or do silly sight-gags.

In short, the show is still funny, but by this point it really began to lose the element that made it unique among sitcoms: its heart.

Note: Marcia Cross (the redhead who's currently on Desperate Housewives) did look pretty hot as Rebecca's sister, though!",1133222400,8,1394,4.824267782426778
2400711,4,B000B5XOTS,"A small group of Bostonians once again congregate at Cheers to share and muse themselves over the oddities that take place within the walls of this basement bar. In the seventh season these people are spearheaded by the former baseball pro Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and the power-hungry Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) who came to the show in 1987.  In season seven these two continue to bang their heads with each other, as the season kicks off where season six ended.  Rebecca looses her beloved Evan Drake to Japan while her new boss gives Sam her job.  However, Rebecca finds a way to get back at Sam in a different episode, which amusingly backfires.

The conflicting personalities of Sam and Rebecca would be too heavy to handle if it was not for their two best friends: the living with mom and trivia-spitting mailman Cliff (John Ratzenberger) and the beer enthusiastic conundrum Norman (George Wendt) whose wife nobody ever has seen.  The thoughtful psychiatrist Fraiser (Kelsey Grammar) brings contrast to the show with his objectively Freudian view on life.  The sarcastic waitress Carla (Rhea Perlman) continues to shoot sharp lines to those who irritate her, and everyone does.  There is also the kindhearted and mindless Woodrow Boyd (Woody Harrelson) who tries to jump into the conversations, but is with complete disconnection with the world.  Together these characters bring new life to the seventh season, as they become the wheels of the sitcom under motor of Sam and Rebecca's quarrelling.

Cheers displays a well-written TV show that offers large amount of chuckles and laughter, as the environment of the bar fosters a sarcastic and quick-witted humor.  The different characters bring a backbone to the jokes and situational humor that allows for the audience to make personal connections.  Episodes such as ""Norm, is that You?"" and ""What's Up, Doc?"" allow the audience to connect with the characters in an hilarious manner, as Norm comes out as an interior decorator and Sam fakes impotence to get to know the aloof Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth).  All of the 22 episodes offer similar terrific humor that will have the audience laughing hard.  However, the seventh season shows signs of minute exhaustion, as it does not reach the same level of entertaining quality of previous season.

Cheers - The Complete Seventh Season offers wonderful comic relief for an audience, especially if the viewer feels a little tired and drained.  Some episodes are better than others, but that is to be expected.  The seventh season seems to suffer a little from some performance fatigue.  It might be a consequence of having had this show on the air for seven years, as it might have caused the audience to become too familiar with the characters.  Thus, this may make many of the comic experiences feel a little repetitive.  Nonetheless, the seventh season offers a very good sitcom experience, which is a must see for Cheers fans and those who simply enjoy well-written humor.",1132963200,17,2981,4.997975708502024
2400712,5,B000B5XOTS,"Whats wrong with you people?!!Cheers is a brilliant show, excellently written and acted, yet it can't even get in the top 100 on the amazon.com Top Sellers TV list? What the heck? I mean some shows that made the list are awful, and some I never heard of. Cheers won more Emmys than any other show ever except two. Its the longest running sitcom of all time tied with Cheers spinoff Frasier and M*A*S*H. Its finale episode is still ranked second all time for a series finale, only behind M*A*S*H. I see stuff that doesn't come out until like December ahead on the Top Sellers list. Cheers The Complete Seventh season is phenominal! Cliffs girlfriend Margaret makes her first appearence and is hilarious. A fantastic season. So why isn't a best seller? Very curious. I don't get it.

Ernie was written out shortly thereafter.

2400715,5,B000B5XOTS,The seventh season includes some of the very best Cheers episodes: Sam coming back from exile in Cancun (The indians there write songs about him ?) to save Rebeca from an unwanted marriage.

Woody singing the unforgettable Kelly song (my favorite all time Cheers moment!).

At times the characters do crazy and funny out of this world stuff but because they seem to build on their written personality--you just float on through their dumb actions.

2400920,5,B000B5XOTS,I watched this season years ago when I was in college. We used to get together as a group every Thursday night to watch it and Coach after. Good to relive such a laugh outload show. Thanks Amazon.,1375574400,,196,4.184210526315789

2400923,5,B000B5XOTS,"One of the best shows of its time, never gets old. It's better than most shows that's currently airing on TV (comedy shows anyway). Shows now days just don't have the same humor as the classics like Cheers, if you've never watched it then I highly recommend it!",1373932800,,261,4.458333333333333
2400924,4,B000B5XOTS,Show is pretty funny.  Especially the episodes with woody and the bar batteles -bar wars.  Coach is pretty good too.,1367625600,,116,4.75
2400925,5,B000B5XOTS,"All eleven seasons of this classic show are fantastic. I had no intention of buying all eleven season but wanted the first five, until Shelly Long left the show. After watching the first five seasons, I bought seasons six, seven, and eighht. Very enjoyable although I never thought the character of Robin Colcord was necessary or very funny. I also thought that sometimes Kirstie Alley went over the top with her Rebecca character, like she watched too much I love Lucy and was imitating Lucille Ball sometimes. All she ever needed to do was play the part and say the lines, and she would have been very good and funny. All in all this is one of the best shows ever done with one of the best casts ever assembled. I bought seasons nine, ten, and eleven and was sad all over again when I saw the last show. Now I can watch it as many times as I want however. There are no out takes in most of these discs just the first season.",1365292800,,926,4.297142857142857

2400928,5,B000B5XOTS,"I chose this rating because the originality of the script writers.  The writers keep the audience laughing with many subplots and themes.  Sam Malone is true to character as an arrogant womanizer and Rebecca is constantly shirking his advances.  Ocasionally, there are remarks which reveal the subtlier and humane sides of characters.  Overall, this is a great show for comic relief.",1362441600,,383,5.229508196721311

2400941,4,B000B5XOTS,"Great series - great season!  But there are some REAL inconsistencies in picture quality in several episodes... to the point where it should be pointed out on the cover art as an alert to the buyer!  I love this show, and it's only a problem in a few episodes, so I will overlook it, but those interested in buying should know this.  It's been about 8 years since I posted an Amazon review, so consider that as well.",1263081600,,416,4.3076923076923075
2400942,2,B000B5XOTS,"While Cheers is one of my favorite series and I would have bought this season anyway to have the whole series (when it is complete), I have started to notice the picture quality issues one prior reviewer noted.  While I have not watched the whole season yet to know how often it happens, the picture quality changes are very noticeable and do take away from the enjoyment of the episodes impacted.  I have no idea why this would happen but it looks like they did a poor quality splice to reinsert certain footage.  Buyer beware",1226793600,4,527,4.526315789473684
2400943,5,B000B5XOTS,"If you're a Cheers fan, you can't beat having the entire set on DVD.  If you've never seen Cheers, it is set in a bar in Boston with a cast of quirky characters that you will soon grow to love.  My husband and I pull out the Cheers dvd when we just want to relax and need a good laugh!",1219017600,,285,3.7333333333333334
2400944,1,B000B5XOTS,"I won't comment on the contents of this season, or on the show in general. Cheers was one of the greatest shows ever and this season was one of the highlights of the series' run. What I will comment on is the horrendous picture quality evident in two of the episodes that I watched from the first two discs- 'One Happy Chappy in a Snappy Serape' and 'Bar Wars II: The Woodman Strikes Back'. There may be more examples of poor picture quality throughout the rest of this set, but I've only managed to watch a few episodes so far.

  In several instances, when the camera angle cuts from one vantage point to another, it appears as if we move from a completely pristine image quality to one that was taken from a 20 year old VHS dubbed copy (of a copy, of a copy). During these scenes, the picture quality is nothing less than pathetic. I'm not knit picking over a slight decrease in quality here. It's so bad that you wonder what kind of engineer could watch this and permit it to be released as a final product. Absurdly darks hues, fuzziness, graininess, etc plague these particular scenes, after which the episode jumps back to another camera angle to show an absolute pristine image. This almost makes it worse than if they were to show the entire episode using the poor quality footage, because it's so inconsistent. You get the idea that you are watching a show from the early 1970s spliced together with something currently on TV. Through the entire sequence however, the audio remains unchanged.

  The most angering part of this situation is that I've seen these episodes on TV in syndication countless times and this image quality issue was never present in those airings. So why is this now a problem? It just doesn't make sense that the DVD presentation should be so much worse than the syndicated version on television. After all, we are paying to see it on DVD. I'm surprised that the other reviewers did not make more of a stink about this. Again, I'm not knit picking over some minor picture flaws. The picture quality is nothing short of offensive. Absolutely unacceptable.",1167177600,7,2089,4.617250673854447
2400945,5,B000B5XOTS,"This is my favorite season of Cheers by far!  Every episode in this season is hilarious and deserves to be watched over and over again.  Running plotlines from season seven include: 1) Rebecca's climb up the coporate ladder after Evan Drake leaves for Japan, 2) the introduction of Kelly and her subsequent romance with Woody, and 3) the pregnancy of Lilith.

As I said, this season is filled with classic episodes.  If pressed, I would say the three best remembered episodes are ""The Gift of the Woodi,"" ""How To Win Friends and Electrocute Yourself,"" and ""Norm, Is That You?""  ""Gift of the Woodi"" features Woody singing the infamous ""Kelly Song"" at Kelly's birthday as Kelly learns the hard lesson that ATMs are not endless supplies of money.  ""How To Win Friends"" is perhaps the funniest episode of the series as Cliff tries to change his behaviour around his companions by having a doctor give him electrical shocks whenever he says something sarcastic or annoying.  Hilarity, of course, ensues.  ""Norm, Is That You?"" has Norm acting as a gay interior designer in order to win over some wealthy, potential clients that are friends of the Cranes.

Season seven is full of good episodes though.  Two memorable episodes feature prominent guest stars.  One has Marcia Cross of ""Desperate Housewives"" fame as Rebecca's sister, and boy was she a hottie back in the late 80's!  The other features then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Crawley, and has the first kiss between Sam and Rebecca.

If you're looking for the ""best of the best,"" then look no further than season seven of Cheers.",1154304000,4,1598,4.830882352941177
2400946,4,B000B5XOTS,"For many years, Cheers filled that Thursday night at 9 time slot that is so key to the biggest night on television. It anchored the NBC lineup for years and even spawned a great spinoff upon its last episode.

Sadly, these days, they don't make sitcoms as good as Cheers anymore.

Season Seven of Cheers finds the gang hitting their stride with new cast member Kirstie Alley, who joined the cast a year earlier as new bar manager Rebecca Howe. Season seven features some memorable moments, but above all, plenty of chances to laugh.

With the bar again changing hands and people moving up and down the corporate ladder, early in the year, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) Cheers' bartender and former owner, finds himself in charge again, while Rebecca finds herself out of a job. Throughout the year the relationship with Sam and Rebecca continues to sizzle, much like that of Sam and Diane in the earlier seasons. It is quite obvious that Sam is attracted to Rebecca, but the feeling certainly isn't mutual. However, the games are fun to watch as Sam tries everything in his book to get Rebecca out on a date.

Carla (Rhea Perlman) celebrates two years of marriage to her husband, former hockey player turned ice show performer Eddie LeBec (guest star Jay Thomas). She also gets to experience the finer side of life thanks to an elegant dinner with Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) and his wife Lilith (guest star Bebe Neuwirth). Of course she wouldn't be Carla without her biting remarks, which are generally thrown in the direction of lonely mailman Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger).

Cliff and Norm Peterson (George Wendt) continue to occupy their seats at the end of the bar, coming up with weird schemes and ideas to get back at their competitor's bar, or to avoid work, or to do just about anything. Cliff also finds love with a fellow postal carrier, only to have it snuffed out when he has to lie to protect her job and she leaves for Canada. Norm finds his calling as an interior decorator, though can't quite learn how to be gay to impress his yuppie clients.

Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), Cheers' lovable but slow bartender, meets rich girl Kelly Gaines (guest star Jacky Swanson) at a party he is working at and the two fall in love. Though Woody has no money and Kelly is loaded, the two are almost a perfect match, as they seem to have the same simple minds, and they compliment each other very well. This relationship is one that continued for a number of years on the show.

Frasier and Lilith also are on the cusp of becoming parents, as Lilith is pregnant with their son as the season comes to a close. They go through their normal bickering, as viewers of the show came to expect over the years. The two of them are great comic foils for each other and bring a level of sophistication to the bar, a welcome addition for sure.

As has been the case with the last few seasons, there are no extras on this set, which is one of the reasons this doesn't get five stars. Additionally, there are a number of scenes that appear really, really dark, particularly on the first disc, though there is no reason for it.

Also, look for a pre-Melrose appearance by future Desperate Housewife Marcia Cross.

All in all, it is great to look back over these episodes and remember when television was capable of producing great sitcoms. It is a dying breed, but one that Cheers mastered so well for so many years.",1151366400,4,3400,4.586490939044481

FANTASTIC SEASON!!!

As usual, Sam's sex-crazy,

Rebecca's power-hungry and tense,

Carla's grungy and snappy,

Cliff's boring and numb,

Norm is lovable and wasted,

Lileth is flat-voiced and tight-bunned,

Woody is so stupid he's lovable,

and Fraiser's blossoming in hilarity!!!!

I love The Kelly Song!

And one of the best lines is:

""Well, there IS some crap up with which I will not put!""

It just keeps getting better and better!!!
