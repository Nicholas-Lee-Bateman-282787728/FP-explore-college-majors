2640789,1,B000HT3P56,"Forget the X-Files, CSI, Kolchak the Night Stalker.. you want to see the Creepiest show on television.. you got it right here! I've tried my damnest to get into this show, being somewhat of a lewd male myself, but even I can't get passed the idea that for every case they take on there should be equal or greater the number of sexual harrasment suits during every single episode! That's not what makes it ""creepy"" though.. granted, a little sexual tension is amusing when it's portrayed by attractive actors or actresses that at least show a good deal of ""CHARISMA"".. the characters that Spader and Shatner play are not only visualy Repulsive in their bloated forms, they also portray their characters as stuffy, Nueotic and flat out Weird.. which doesn't make it appealing when they molest a client or two, it simply makes them Creepy! You can almost imagine this is how Ted Bundy must've appealed to his contacts. In one episode they actually had Shatner and another partner played by Robert Wagner simultaneaously feeling up Jeri Ryan as she squirmed helplessly in the courtroom as a defendant (DURING A CASE) And exactly HOW in God's name is this suppose to be funny?? Especially to families that have any idea of what good taste is??? (I've read reviews were people talk about their kids ejoying it... great, you're raising future molestors - of COURSE they're interested!) Of course getting back to that scene, even though Jeri squirms for her life in the defendant's chair between two disgusting bloated old farts, she accepts the attention of Spader instead.. who always has the look on his face like he just slaughtered three co-workers, drank their blood and is trying to get the one he's talking to not to look down because he's wearing their skull as a Jock strap... How in God's name did a show get people this addicted when the leads are complete psychotics? At least they have Julie Bowen to drool over.. if you can take the creepy shivers the rest of the cast gives you.",1164499200,4,1986,4.726224783861672
2640790,4,B000HT3P56,"Just finished watching season 2 and I was glad I bought it. The first few episodes were okay, didn't really like the story lines. Too much time spent with new members of the cast. But once the series got rolling all the old magic came back. If you loved season 1 you will not be disappointed with season 2. I wish there had been some commentary tracks, the extras are weak but the shows are solid.",1164412800,4,397,4.2368421052631575
2640791,5,B000HT3P56,"I absolutely love this series.  It has the quirkiness of ALLY MCBEAL and the legal drama without all the pretentiousness of THE PRACTICE.  Even when I watch this show ""live"" I still record it cuz the court scenes that James Spader is in are worth watching over and over.  The writers are fantastic--the social and political commentary are what I wish our own elected officials would think and say.  Alan Shore and Denny Crane are definitely a Dynamic Duo.",1164067200,3,455,4.7215189873417724
2640792,5,B000HT3P56,"There's nothing like it.  You'll have a great time enjoying this series.  It's meaningful, hilarious and well-written.",1163721600,,118,5.882352941176471
2640793,5,B000HT3P56,"The best combination of comedy, drama and social commentary the I've ever seen. I love it!!  I will be buying both seasons for the social commentary alone, not to mention how the James Spader character has developed over the two seasons.  You don't see that too often.  William Shatner is GREAT one of his BEST ROLES EVER.  Anyway, great show, you won't be dissappointed.",1160092800,22,371,4.75
2640794,5,B000HT3P56,"The folks are back for a second season, although there are some departures and arrivals of a few cast characters.  The writing continues to be top notch during this second season.

David Kelly's signature is all over Boston Legal.  The key to this series is interesting characters.  Many have some really bizzar bahavior which is compelling to witness. L.A. Law, which was where Kelly got his start had the same hook which was why I also loved THAT show. If only they would release that someday soon.

Anyway, I'll wait until this second series goes on sale just like the first before picking it up...",1160006400,8,601,4.685714285714286
2640795,5,B000HT3P56,"Boston Legal is such an intelligent, brilliant and funny show.  This second season is equally as good as the first, and I still watch it each and every week.  The witty banter and the bizzare cases and relationships are hilarious.  William Shatner and James Spader steal the show but all of the cast is really good.  They all have the perfect timing and delivery that makes for a great comedy/drama.

My favourite episodes in this season are ... There's Fire (where Denny is caught in a closet with another woman on his wedding day) and the one with Tom Selleck who wants Shirley back in his life even though he's now getting married.  There are also other great guest stars on here like Robert Wagner, Jeri Ryan, Leslie Jordan, Betty White, Michael J Fox, Ed Begley Jr, Parker Posey, Freddie Prinze Jr, Adam Arkin and Shelley Berman to name a few.

How they keep this show getting better all the time is beyond me.  It's not just your average courtroom drama, but a fantastic show that will keep you glued to the screen everytime it's on.  I really love it and hope you have as much fun with it as I do.",1158019200,97,1104,4.425742574257426

2640826,5,B000HT3P56,"This is a great series, although shown in 2006, it is a timely demonstration that political issues really don't change. There are two Americas. During the time of this series, it appears the two side can talk to one another.  A far cry from todays political discourse which has turned bitter without any real polite social discourse.

I'm not a liberal, and I don't care for the in-your-face liberal agenda that comes across, not to mention the ribaldry and anti-religious elements.  Denny Crane was quickly turned into a ridiculous caricature of what conservatives stand for.  I found these things deeply offensive.

The characterizations were hilarious (in a good way), and the relationships and interweaving ""cases"" were cleverly crafted. Season Two is even better with a change in some of the personnel and additional wacky characters. Betty White is a hoot!

First is the characters: they are just outstanding, so intriguing and interesting, not only the headliners but, unusually, also all of the minor characters as well, from judges to clients. My favourite of this season is Judge Jibber Jabber, what a hoot. There are some great guest stars, including Betty White, Michael J. Fox, Leslie Jordan, and Al Sharpton. Star Trek fans will notice heavy casting of minor and major characters from other Star Trek series, including Jeri Ryan (7 of 9 - Voyager), Rene Auberjonois (Odo - DS9), Armin Shimerman (Quark - DS9), Ethan Phillips (Neelix - Voyager), and of course William Shatner (Captain Kirk - Star Trek).

Second is the wit of the writing: there are brilliant little jabs thrown in here and there that aren't done obviously, and that not everyone will catch, including references to the news, history, other shows, and the previous roles of some actors (including the very occasional Star Trek reference for Shatner).

You will enjoy yourself thoroughly.",1360800000,,1232,4.829383886255924

About the discs delivered from Amazon on Prime: Boston Legal - There must be problems in Amazon's warehouse or distribution center or supplier. Both Season Two and Season Three arrived in damaged packaging with discs loose and scuffed. I am extremely displeased, as these are gifts that I fortunately opened to inspect.

2641194,3,B000HT3P56,"This series is great fun if you can get past the political partisanship.

The Hollywood writers seem to make a jab at the Bush Administration (or just Bush and Cheney personally) every episode. Their criticisms about the 1)loss of our rights, 2) loss of our freedom, 3) lies about the war on terror, 4) evil torture of terror suspects, and 5) evil spying on every American by Bush are even more humorous consider the stories were written after Bush won re-election. So of course the writers then take to task the ""stupid"" voters for re-electing the guy. (in the ""Jibber Jabber"" episode.)

Never mind that the voters also elected a fully Democrat congress in 2006 to supposedly head off this river of abuses. And never mind that the Obama administration today continues every single program that led to the death of Bin Laden, and continuing the war on terror. The Hollywood writers do their part, to try to get Democrats elected, while making up the facts as they go along. One can be assured the tone of every political episode would have been written from the opposite side, with Obama as President.

Denny Crane, lovable as he is, is the typical Hollywood straw man conservative who must be knocked down with false positions and false statements misrepresenting 1/2 of the potential television audience for the show, if the writers were interested in writing for all Americans and just not their favored political party.

If it seems I'm lingering on national politics on what is supposed to be entertainment, surprise! You just got a preview for 9/10ths of the episodes from this season. Good thing I got it at a discount.",1305331200,2,1626,4.796428571428572

I learned that Texas has no state supreme court - important since TX executes more prisoners than any other state (VA is next in line).  The case about the smoker being fired because she was an ""at will"" employee was so true.  Ageism was also covered and at the end, the show itself was subject to this and added a few lines of dialogue alluding to it.

Season 2 is longer, slicker and much more of an entertainer than the first season. The show churns out one gripping case after another, not forgetting, in its trademark fashion, to also introduce us to some of the strangest, most oddball characters in the world.

The story arcs, relationships and cases are well written and complement the craziness of the show and of the dynamic duo heading it. While every episode is great, some of the best ones come midway through the season when Michael J. Fox sweeps the show away with his cancer-ridden yet profoundly charming special appearance.

Overall, the some of the best work to come from the cast and writers of the show and the only season that's worth the watch for any Boston Legal or Practice fan. If that's not enough, here's the two words that clich every deal -

2641257,5,B000HT3P56,"Hi,
Must I say I was a bit wary of seeing a series notoriously depicting lawyers' professional and private life at large? Be they Bostonians, or whatever. Attorneys boringly tend to be the same, worldwide, and that's an understatement when it comes down to believing in simple ethics, for starters.
Now, be it a make-believe or not, I had a feeling I was coming closer to the real world, which I kinda got to know in the past. These people have a lot of shortcomings, they make a very profitable business out of the ordinary people's shortcomings, there's no telling where they will go to outsmart the shadowy fringes of law.
The fact is the screenplays are usually very smart, asking real questions and giving sometimes not-so-satisfactory answers, the way it definitely goes in the day-to-day reality. I like that. That's real life, with real bright non-nonsense, no-heroes who are definitely knowing this business brings a lot of difficult daily choices to be made along with it.
I also like the way people there skid at times a personal reflection or two about the powers-that-be. Denny Crane's references to ""Antonio"", ""Dick"" or ""Jebb"" are choice pickles to keep in mind when the time comes to look back at what these last unfortunate years really were.

2641287,5,B000HT3P56,"Boston Legal is without doubt the best television writing I have ever seen.  It is the story of every day shenanigans in a law firm in Boston and is absolutely hilarious.

 It makes you laugh, it makes you think, it is enlightening on a wide variety of issues and backs them all up with hard facts.  All the characters, even the minor ones are well developed and highly entertaining.  Their strengths and weaknesses are dealt with incredible warmth and humour without becoming in any way melodramatic.  It is also surreal and quirky at the same time, and all of that in 40 short minutes!  Each episode is perfectly spaced and complete.  It has the best one-liners I have ever come across.  The closing arguments are clear, concise and so very eloquently delivered; you can discuss each one for days.  The acting is of a very high standard and brings that wonderful writing to life and does it total justice.

I was hooked after 2-3 episodes and ended up watching all of them.  Season 2 certainly doesn't disappoint, but I also highly recommend seasons 1 and 3.  It is now in its 4th season and I find it incredible that with each new episode they still manage to hold our interest as if it was the first.  It is like watching a never-ending comedy feature film, and you just don't want it to ever end!  You can watch it over and over again and still laugh out loud.  Nothing I can say can recommend it highly enough.",1202428800,,1416,4.47265625

2641299,5,B000HT3P56,"This is one of my favorite television series.  Kelly has done it again!  Season 2 is every bit as entertaining as Season 1.  This all-star cast with frequent guest appearances goes beyond expectations.  Alan Shore (Spader) consistently delivers his lines with such passion and realism, that it's hard to forget he is not an attorney!

Betty White and Michael J. Fox are among the Season 2 guest stars. The story lines surrounding their appearances present viewers with controversial issues with a humorous and endearing spin.  The writing on this show is extraordinary!

At the end of each show, Alan Shore (Spader) and Denny Crane (Chatner) spend a few minutes on Crane's balcony discussing whatever's on their minds. The banter between the two is demonstrative of the special bond they share.  It is rewarding to watch programming where two adult men can be ""macho"" and touching at the same time.  Shore's practical approach to Crane's bizzare remarks make for excellent dialogue.",1199059200,,982,5.0875

The relationship between Denny and Alan takes on more dimensions, and the cast includes females that aren't simple throw-away characters.  The balcony scenes still close every episode.  The humor is as topical and timeless as ever; at times irreverent and always almost-too-dark.

I'd recommend not watching the whole season at once.  This season has Denny and Alan trying to figure out their relationship, so they get on each other's nerves more.  If you watch it straight through, the struggles and reconciliations between the two start to seem a little too brief to be even fictional-believable.  With a little time between viewing, however, I think you'll really appreciate what great scripting and direction this show has.

'Let's hope they pick us up for another season' Why did that even have to be said, because this show is fantastic! The fact of the matter is people are just not watching as much tv as they use to. Today however if they are, they are watching the right shows and Boston Legal happens to be one of them. After numorous nods from the emmys this show bursts onto the small screen better than ever. With a minor cast change unfortunatly letting go of Monica Potter, the cast is just as sharp and witty. With a new full time cast member in Julie Bowen and plenty of appearences from very famous faces, including Michael J. Fox, Tom Seleck and Robert Wagner every episode expands the story of the law firm of Crane Poole & Schmidt and even does justice by wrapping up older stories from the first season. There are very few shows I would recomend to purchase on dvd, but I assure you this is one you will want to watch more than once and I am only sure that eventhough I saw not a single episode of season 3 it will not be a dissapointment.",1187049600,,1174,4.222222222222222

The comedy is much more in the foreground, however (certainly much more than it was in the comparatively serious Practice), and the manic quirks of Alan Shore, Denny Crane and Co. are very much central to the show's charm.

The actors break character and acknowledge their parts in a tv show more than has been seen on any popular show since Moonlighting, and there is always something for the Star Trek fans out there (check out the cling-ons quip when Alan and Denny go fishing in British Columbia), especially since Kirk and Odo ore joined by Seven of Nine in the last two episodes of the season.

Stars of the show are Alan Shore (James Spader), Denny Crane (William Shatner) and Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen). Especially the friendship between the first two is unlike anything ever seen on tv. Alan is a democrat, who bends the rules whenever convenient. Denny is the most stereotypical right-wing republican you could possibly imagine. He always carries a gun. Or guns. Patriot is his middle name, and everything purely American is good. Like Texas. Or cowboys. Or the war in Iraq.

But despite the huge differences between the two, the most special friendship is shown in Boston Legal. And it's not something the writers could have possible imagined before the series started.

For this friendship alone, watch Boston Legal. And otherwise you can watch it for the amazingly fascinating story lines, for Candice, for the hilarious humour, for the drama, for the music...

2641575,3,B000HT3P56,"Having enjoyed the predecessor to this show, ""The Practice"" I had high hopes for Boston Legal.  Granted it made the jump from drama to sitcom, but it also morphed from entertainment to liberal propaganda.  The intelligent characters are staunch liberals, while the only known republican is suffering from ""mad cow,"" and is unable to control himself, often making lewd remarks, shooting people, and womanizing

  Aside from the preachy speeches given by the writers to promote a liberal agenda and the not-so-masked attempt to portray Republicans as gun toting sexual deviant bumbling fools, Boston Legal has an excellent cast of characters to depict outrageously humorous scenerios.  The actors are of the highest calibur, and the roles were perfectly cast.  Shatner and Spader have a very believable relationship as friends, and it warms the heart to watch them together.  You have to see it for yourself to fully appreciate the charm these two men bring to the show.

  Overall, this show is a gem.  The only criticism to be made about this program is the conversion from entertainment to liberal propaganda.  If, in the future, the writers see fit to abandon the political persuasion, this show would certainly warrant a full five stars.

2641686,5,B000HT3P56,"Like ""Scrubs"" (another vastly underappreciated series), ""Boston Legal"" enters each week into a loopy alternate universe where the most insane comedy brilliantly and smartly illuminates this other world in which we mere mortals are presently stuck.  I believe this show started out as another TV legal drama, but it has exhilaratingly mutated into a wonderful mixture of the two sides of David Kelley--soap opera and berserk farce.

The main reason for me to tune in is James Spader as the ""ethically challenged"" attorney Alan Shore.  Spader was stuck being typecast as yuppie scum for the first era of his career (but he was always eminently watchable).  In the recent movie ""Secretary"" he reinvented himself and his persona as The Perv With The Heart Of Gold, and this is also the basis for Shore.  He is a cold barracuda with a basilisk stare and a rampaging libido who hides his essentially kind heart.  He also has that Don Rickles tongue--he will say anything to anybody.  In season 2, which is on this DVD set, we get to see several sides of Shore: his aid to the beleagured ""Hands"" Espenson; his clown phobia (with Spader's priceless horrified facial expressions); his night terrors; and flirtation with his foxy, wholesome, crazy assistant Melissa (Marisa Coughlan).

Spader's unexpected partner in crime is the Captain himself, William Shatner, as senile egomanical blowhard and wily legal genius Denny Crane (DennyCrane!). Shatner and Spader turned out to be as terrific a comedy team as Abbott and Costello (or Ackroyd and Belushi, or Spade and Farley.)  Spader's cerebral introvert plays off Shatner's wild extrovert, and vice versa.  And Shatner's larger-than-life performance gets to break through the ""4th wall"" of the TV screen, just like Bugs Bunny (""I'm actually a pretty good actor"" he tells Spader at one point; ""I won an Emmy, y'know."")

This season also marked the arrival of the excruciatingly charming and pretty Julie Bowen (fresh from ""Ed""; where in the hell is that DVD?) as attorney Denise Bauer.  Candice Bergen nicely underplays her tart adversary to the boys, Shirley Schmidt.  And there are the usual cascade of stellar guest appearances in Kelley's always inventive storylines (Tom Selleck, Jeri Ryan, Heather Locklear, and Kelley regulars Betty White and Peter MacNicol to name a few.)  This is just a rollicking good time and an excellent show, and you should acquire these DVD's as soon as you can.",1166918400,12,2434,5.067669172932331

2641740,5,B000HT3P56,"First, I have to agree with everything Amazon's Editorial Critic, Jeff Shannon, had to say in his review.  I wish I'd written it myself.  I absolutely love this show.  It's brillantly written, acted, directed, designed, and filmed.  I quickly became a fan of the Alan Shore (James Spader) character during the last season of The Practice.  I then followed him to Crane, Poole & Schmidt, where he blossomed into the type of lawyer that you have to stand up and cheer for, no matter how naughty he is at the office.  Though his long trial closings may tire him, they bring pure joy to my heart with the sense of justice embedded within each word that he utters.  Great writing!  In Season 2, Alan Shore also became more human with his fear of clowns, night terrors, and a level of stress that causes him to mix up his words.  More thought was definitely put into Denny Crane's (William Shatner) character this season, as well as his friendship with Alan and the get together on the balcony at the end of each show.  They both embody the true meaning of friendship between men, while kidding about it at the same time.  Though I didn't particularly like the characters played by Mark Valley, Candice Bergen, and Rene Auberjonois in the first season, I grew to respect them much more in Season 2 as their characters were fleshed out and given more to do.  The scenes where Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois) confronts his daughter about her drug addiction was the type of acting that brings tears to one's eyes with the truth, love, and sincerity that are protrayed.  Adding to the cast of regulars was Julie Bowen as Denise, who hopes to make partner within the firm.  She brough a new edge to the series with her intelligence and sexiness, and I was surprised by what happened in the last episode.  I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Boy, was this also the year for guest stars: Tom Selleck (you could definitely see the chemistry between him and Candice Bergen), Michael J. Fox (who can still knock you out with his acting, charm, and boyish good-looks and ends up saving the day at the end), Joanna Cassidy (still as beautiful and sexy as ever), Jeri Ryan (I don't know about Alan Shore's breath, but she literally took mine away), Ed Begly, Jr., Robert Wagner, Henry Gibson, Howard Hesseman, Betty White, Freddie Prince, Jr., and even director, Wes Craven.  Parker Posey's addition to the cast at the end of the season was a stroke of genius.  Think of the movie, Blade III, but without the fangs.  She's going to be a match for Alan Shore!!!  The only complaint I have about the disc collection is that the two featurettes only total about fifteen minutes.  There should've been two-to-three hours of extras.  One clear thing that has happened with Season 2 (I don't know if it's the writers or the actors doing it), is that the characters acknowledge that this is a TV show through comments here and there.  Rather than pulling me out of the moment, it causes me to laugh along with them and to enjoy the tongue-in-cheek jest.  In my opinion, Boston Legal is the best series on television today.  As much as I dislike lawyers, I love the ones on this show and often think that I'd like to be Alan Shore with his firm sense of justice, equality, integrity, and sexual pervertedness.  When he gives you his promise, you know that he'll keep it no matter what the cost.  I'd rate this collection 10 Stars, if I could, but five will have to suffice.  Highly Recommended!!!",1164499200,8,3475,4.588330632090762
