8475992,4,B005JTE33C,I liked the plot and the ending though I know the direction I thought I would go (sadness and crying) but I was upset the hero died and the villain will strike again and no one to stop him.  Very good movie. Thought the camerawork needed some better and dialogue was a bit dry the kid just held my heart and Blair with end me to believe he would survive.,1454112000,,354,4.057142857142857

8475994,5,B005JTE33C,"This is a movie worth buying.  Every person that I know that has seen this movie said ""You never told me it would make me cry"" as well as ""Wow, it was great!""  I say this because this is not a high budget film and in my mind that means it is low on content.  Well this is a truly wonderful movie, very well but together.  From the very start of the film I had thoughts of dislike but that made me watch harder and as that first part was done I found myself taken by surprise by the little 5 year old boy that the movie is based on.  This little man will make you laugh and make you cry.  Keep and eye on young Ryan, he is going places and keep your eye on Erica Summers who directed this movie.  I hear she has started a new film.",1316563200,,730,3.8266666666666667
8475995,5,B005JTE33C,"This movie was well done and depicted a story of an unfortunate child (the taboo subject of child sexual abuse is dealt with but in a tasteful manner) who is befriended by a hired hand. This story will pull you in and take you for a ride of all emotions. The child is adorable and the friendship is heartwarming, it will give you that warm fuzzy feeling and then rip your heart out. The ending isn't predictable and it is a good watch that will  either leave you speechless or talking about it for weeks to come.  The proceeds from the movie all went to help sheltered abused children.  It is a must see!",1315353600,4,604,4.280701754385965

You'll laugh, you'll cry, it's got everything! Oh, and check out the actress in the first scene...she's awesome!",1315008000,3,249,4.555555555555555
