8183038,3,B000O5B4EW,Had no idea there were so few episodes on this one disc.  I have other vintage TV shows on dvd and they have a lot more shows than this disc has.,1377734400,,145,3.6774193548387095
8183039,5,B000O5B4EW,"Gale Storm, who also starred in The Gale Storm Show (Oh, Susanna) was a cute, pert actress who, like Lucille Ball, was always getting into hilarious situations. In this series she played the daughter of a well-off businessman who had to keep a watchful eye on her capers. Amazon should be highly credited for providing us with a number of DVD's of the greatest TV shows of the '50s and '60s before programs had to provide 'messages' and propagandize the writers' views, just be funny and entertaining without offending some viewers or cause them to worry that little ears might hear objectionable or offensive language. They make great gifts, especially to the older generation (my parents love them).",1351382400,,701,4.9491525423728815
8183040,4,B000O5B4EW,I always enjoyed these shows as a young girl and they are still funny to me.  I think Gale Storm was very cute and funny.  Very enjoyable DVD.,1306713600,,142,4.035714285714286
