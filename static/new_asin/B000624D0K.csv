2158730,5,B000624D0K,"This video is a must buy if you want to learn the Irish fiddle from one of the best. Kevin burke teaches you each tune slowly than takes you up to full speed with some great slides, jigs and polkas. He teaches the correct way to bow that enhances that Irish sound along with all the grace notes and left handed techniques that will make your fiddle playing very impressive.",1200096000,4,373,4.3428571428571425
2158731,5,B000624D0K,My 11 year old daughter enjoys this because it offers information that she's not getting from her traditional lessons.  She thinks he's a better teacher than her piano teacher.  We watch a portion and pause the DVD while she practices what she just learned.,1194307200,4,257,4.818181818181818
2158732,5,B000624D0K,"This is a great DVD piano course, as long as you have basic music theory and basic keyboard knowledge.  After about 3 weeks I'm playing blues on the piano!!",1193184000,2,156,4.379310344827586
2158733,5,B000624D0K,"I've collected several instructional fiddle/violin dvds over the past year, and this one is by far the most enjoyable and clear to learn from.  The tunes are easy to pick up for an advanced beginner and yet they are complex enough melody-wise for friends and family to enjoy. I actually LOVE playing each of these tunes. This was a nice change of pace from the Suzuki books I'm currently using.  Good job, Kevin Burke and Homespun! Can't wait to get Kevin's #2 DVD.",1183852800,11,465,4.590361445783133
2158734,4,B000624D0K,"Cohen uses a fair amount of musical terminology (like diminished chord, 6th chord, 7th chord, minor scale, major scale) and if you don't know those terms you're likely to feel lost.  If you do have a basic grasp of musical terminology and theory, however, then you can use this DVD to learn some cool piano blues.

I've only been working on piano for a couple of months now, but this DVD helped me to learn some basic shuffles with the left hand and some of the less-challenging comps with the right hand, and it's enough to motivate me to work even harder to conquer the harder stuff.  (Disclaimer:  At this point I'm playing stuff very slowly, and chord changes and turnarounds are still pretty awkward and frequently flubbed.  I don't want to make it sound like I've mastered anything.  I'm just...on my way.)

Cohen moves fast and takes no prisoners, so be prepared to use the pause and rewind buttons a lot.  He doesn't spend much time on any given topic, but his explanations are clear and helpful.  I keep moving from the piano bench to the couch, playing then watching.

There's no secret magical formula here to make blues piano easier.  It was quite a struggle for me to make that initial breakthrough, and I have a long, long way to go to be able to play smoothly and up to speed.  But if you're determined and motivated, the material here is definitely enough to get you well on your way.",1171843200,36,1400,4.511904761904762
2158735,4,B000624D0K,"I agree with the other reviews here, if you are not into sheet music you can learn from this very quickly especially if you already know something of the terminology of 1 3 5 7 and how it applies to your keyboard activity. My son is tinkling away as I write inspired each time he watches a bit more of the DVD.

My only criticism is that the overhead camera would be better about 10 or twenty degrees off to one side to give a better idea of the finger movement.

if not that then maybe lighting from the side to give some shadows for the same effect.",1171411200,10,551,4.092592592592593
2158736,5,B000624D0K,"I've found this DVD well-suited to my learning style. It's oriented not around sheet music, but demonstration & explanation.

The presenter is personable, communicates well, and introduces some fun & interesting blues piano in a way that sends me dashing constantly back to the keyboard to try things out.",1168300800,14,305,5.224489795918367
2158737,5,B000624D0K,"I play by ear and am taking fiddle lesson from a Sukuki Violin teacher. That is not the direction I want to go, although I am learning some basics. Kevin Burke's style of teaching and music is more the direction I want to go. I live in a rural area, so do have lots of choices for teachers and don't have time to drive far for lessons.

I have used DVDs successfully to help learn difficult software programs -so I thought I'd give this a try.

Was pleasantly surprised....just right for me.",1165881600,7,491,4.326086956521739
2158738,5,B000624D0K,If you are like me and play by ear - this is an excellent learning video.  A background in music theory will help you take this even further.  Highly reccommended.,1127952000,7,163,4.4
2158739,5,B000624D0K,I have had no musical training and cannot read any notes yet after watching this DVD i can play these blues chords and notes.  The instruction is so simple and practical.  You will have to pause a few times to practice the notes and chords you just learned before going on to the next step.  As he is teaching the camera will view down on the top of the piano and  keys so you can see exactly what you are being taught and exactly where to place your fingers.. I think its a very helpful video and very fun!,1109721600,38,507,4.090909090909091
2158760,5,B000624D0K,I am a great fan of Kevin Burke and new to violin playing. He does an excellent job in teaching the tunes and shares a lot of good pointers and tricks to playing Irish music and violin in general. He plays each tune at its normal speed then slows it down. The camera person did a good job in showing what Kevin's hands were doing. I highly recommend the DVD. It's great that a master at playing Irish fiddle decided to share what he knows and meet the users at their level.,1286150400,2,473,4.1521739130434785
2158761,5,B000624D0K,"Although Mr. Cohen won't hope to hear it; he's been around for a hundred years and is a HUGE pro.  His thumbprint on the music scene for my (baby boomer) generation is indelible.  Learning a new instrument at 50+ takes patience and repeated example. This format is entirely useful and beneficial.  Although it will take me a long while to gain accomplishment before moving on too-much to the next level, I'd surely acquire (hook or crook) the next series of lessons from Cohen.",1265414400,3,477,4.72289156626506
2158762,5,B000624D0K,"Just what I needed.  A jump start.  I feel like I can play blues piano after just this one lesson.  It tought me some basic comping ideas, great licks, scales and endings that really got my creative juices flowing. 'Well worth every penny and then some.

Unlike another reviewer, I found the dvd menu and chapter breaks well placed and useful for jumping to material I wanted to review.  I will be purchasing more of David Cohen's instructional material.  If it's half as helpful as this dvd, I'll be happy.",1257638400,2,507,4.5777777777777775
2158763,4,B000624D0K,Mr. Cohen delivers an easy to follow instructional dvd on how to play proper blues piano. I am about half way through and have already learned alot. My main goal in obtaining the dvd was to learn some licks and tricks. I am doing just that while also learning the theory behind what I am playing.,1248825600,3,296,4.303571428571429
2158764,2,B000624D0K,"For an absolute beginner this DVD was difficult to follow (the Homespun catalog description says no prior experience necessary). The first 15 minutes were easy to understand and very helpful. However, after the first lesson, he stops explaining everything and basically plays various notes with his right hand while continuing the left hand pattern used before. I have skipped ahead a few chapters to see if he ever gets around to explaining what he is doing but he just seems to be continuing the trend of not explaining things. I was greatly disappointed as I can watch anyone play piano and guess as to what they are playing. I have tried numerous times to figure out which keys he is playing, but I am always unsuccessful. The whole experience has been very frustrating because I just want to play my piano, not decipher his playing. I wish I could recommend this product, as Homespun has a generally good reputation, but unless you already have some experience in piano I would not purchase this product.",1238630400,8,1009,4.804597701149425
2158765,4,B000624D0K,"This is a nice DVD to learn a few tunes from. While I'm not new to the violin, I'm relatively new to Irish fiddling, and only in the last year or so have been making any effort to develop my ear. Thus, the hardest part for me is to learn by ear, and that's what I'm focusing on right now. This DVD was great for that purpose. Once learned, the tunes were not really difficult for me, although there are some technique and stylistic emphases which took a little getting used to.
Kevin Burke's style is indeed rather 'laid-back'. It creates sort of a homey atmosphere, which is nice. On the other hand, it means there's not a whole lot of verbal explanation. This is a little annoying, but the net effect is probably positive: it forces you to *listen*! He plays the tunes first at a slowed-down pace, repeating each complete musical phrase twice, and then plays through the whole tune. He also introduces each tune at full-speed, so you have the feel for what it 'should' sound like.
 I found it was a perfect pacing for me, but I would not recommend it to a true beginner. It would have been enormously frustrating. Get some lessons first and get comfortable with fingering, and smooth bowing patterns, then buy this disc and learn from the best!",1235606400,11,1246,4.488986784140969
2158766,2,B000624D0K,The content was excellent but the artist moved to fast. Without any written documention it was difficult to retain the information without constantling pausing the dvd to write notes. The dvd also lacked a  logical menu and smooth access to chapters.,1215820800,6,250,5.097560975609756
2158767,3,B000624D0K,"Frankly I haven't viewed the whole video because he almost put me to sleep with his laid back approach. Also, it is hard to see exactly which notes he is pressing on the fingerboard of the violin when he is teaching a tune. I guess this is the way people are supposed to learn this type of music but I would have preferred an actual reference to music and notes as opposed to just see him pressing down on the strings.",1215388800,,418,4.172839506172839
2158768,5,B000624D0K,"This is an excellent introduction to blues piano. I agree with other reviewers that some music theory knowledge will be helpful (knowledge of intervals, etc.), but Mr. Cohen does a good job of illustrating these concepts as far as they are required to learn the material presented in the lesson. The material is simple, fundamental and it is REALLY GOOD STUFF. If you can play a root/fifth at the keyboard, you will be doing blues shuffles immediately. All of the examples are in the key of C to keep down on the accidentals. As an adult beginner on the piano, I am very pleased with the instruction. Pick this up and start developing the ability to improvise some blues piano. This also makes a great companion to his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Bennett-Cohen-Teaches-Blues-Piano-A-Hands-On-Course-in-Traditional-Blues-Piano-Listen-Learn/dp/0793562570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Bennett Cohen Teaches Blues Piano: A Hands-On Course in Traditional Blues Piano (Listen & Learn)</a>.",1203033600,3,1040,6.13013698630137
2158769,2,B000624D0K,"This DVD, like a lot of others, assumes that you already know how to play the fiddle.  I do wish that beginner videos were really for beginners.  It would have been a total waste of money had it not come with sheet music so I could at least figure out what he was doing.  I do not recommend this for anyone who does not already know the note placement on the finger board or for anyone who cannot play by ear.",1201478400,3,409,4.0246913580246915

8036775,5,B000624D0K,"I was skeptical buying this DVD at first seeing as how I can count on one hand how many times I have picked up a fiddle in my life, but, my boy, was I surprised! Kevin Burke is a master and teaches you the barebones tunes without all the fancy Irish ornamentation. You don't need to be able to read a note of music to use this DVD(though there is sheet music included in the DVD-ROM for each tune). In all, this is a GREAT introduction to fiddling. Learning these tunes will get you headed in the right direction in regards to Irish and Scottish music, bluegrass music, and country music.

Words of wisdom: if you ever get frustrated, play slower.",1454457600,,647,4.347107438016529
8036776,4,B000624D0K,"Difficult to follow. Love the teacher. If you have a good music background, it's an informative-type DVD. Otherwise, don't waste your money.",1452470400,,140,5.409090909090909

8036778,5,B000624D0K,Recieved this item very quickly. I would encourage anyone wanting to learn the fiddle to buy it. Excited for my grandson to learn,1392768000,,129,4.6521739130434785
8036779,5,B000624D0K,I love this guy.  He is the best Irish fiddle player and teaches you some great licks and slows down to help anyone learn,1388534400,,121,4.041666666666667
8036780,3,B000624D0K,"What a disappointment. I bought the 2nd DVD too after I heard from someone say it was better. It's slightly better. 3.1 Stars.

I agree with comments about putting you to sleep. To be honest I couldn't make it through either DVD.

His explanation on Roll's on the 2nd DVD is just awful.

If you already know how to play Irish Music and Ornaments you might enjoy this DVD to help understand his style simple by watching and listening and skip extremely terse explanations.

I can't believe there isn't something better out there. Kevin Burke isn't the only Fiddle Training DVD that has the same issue.

Pretty rare to find ones with really good instruction, exercises etc. to get you there.

If you are just starting on Irish Genre, this is not your DVD.
If you are just starting Fiddle this is not your DVD.

If you have some experience picking up tunes by ear and want to learn more Irish tunes strictly by ear. Go for it.
If you have experience with Irish Music and want to learn more about Kevin Burke's sound and how he might bow something. Go for it.",1385683200,,1055,4.435233160621761
8036781,5,B000624D0K,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that some previous musical knowledge is necessary for utilizing this DVD. This is not for the rank beginner. However, if you're fairly well versed in the blues and have some familiarity with New Orleans & Gospel piano styles, this is really an excellent way to help fill up your blues toolbox and expand your capabilities. This can open up whole new worlds to you and really helps to make you a better player.",1330992000,,450,4.567901234567901
8036782,5,B000624D0K,These are some Good Old Irish Fiddle Tunes.  Good Instruction with a slow pace which I think in good.  However some previous fiddle playing experience or previous lessons would be very helpful.,1291852800,,193,5.0
8036783,5,B000624D0K,"What a treat - a 90 minute private lesson from one of the greats of Irish fiddling, Kevin Burke.  I'm sorry some reviewers felt his delivery was too laid back.  I happened to enjoy his relaxed attitude and delivery.  He clearly loves what he does and shares some wonderful insights into his playing style.  Mr. Burke makes it clear from the outset that there is no ""set"" way to play these tunes; he simply shares his thoughts and techniques.  Tunes covered are Bill Sullivan's Polka, Britches Full of Stitches, Saddle the Pony, Connaughtman's Rambles, John Leary's Slide, Micko Russell's Slide, and The King of the Faeries.  A booklet accompanies the DVD with all the tunes in standard notation as well as recommended bowing patterns.  Each tune is broken down phrase by phrase.  I'm buying DVD Two very soon!",1286928000,6,809,4.811594202898551
