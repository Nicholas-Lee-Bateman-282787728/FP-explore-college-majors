8601702,5,B00E65M5OY,"There was a time back in the day when there were many questions about Shakespeare and a time when his sonnets and plays went through some differences and this speculation is as good as any other. We have Rupert Graves as Shakespeare, chillingly well done. We have Indira Varma as the possible woman he loved and referred to as the dark woman and then we have Tom Sturridge as who he may have referred to as the ""Fair Youth"" also seeming to have some kind of infatuation with him too which went seemingly unrequited. The beauty of the young earl and the exoticness (is that a word) of the dark lady who was a call girl enthralled him so much. I loved the story and the acting and the scenery. So good.",1485129600,,700,4.3106060606060606
8601703,3,B00E65M5OY,"Not bad at all but not quite what expected.  The acting was very good, the scenery lovely in the country and 'slummy' in London - in other words, pretty darn realistic.  Not sure if this was supposed to be a drama or a documentary but it worked fairly well as either - just not brilliantly.  That said, it was (and is) worth watching.",1428364800,,334,4.26984126984127
8601704,4,B00E65M5OY,"The identity of ""The Dark Lady"" and ""Mr. W.H."" in Shakespeare's sonnets has been a mystery for centuries. Any number of writers (most famously Oscar Wilde) have presented their own theories and conjectures. In ""A Waste of Shame,"" directed by John McKay, screenwriter/novelist William Boyd (A Good Man in Africa, Any Human Heart) presents his own poignant, intriguing answer to the mystery.

As ""Mr. W.H.,"" Boyd selects one of the more usual suspects--William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. For ""The Dark Lady,"" he creates a French-Moorish courtesan, Lucie. Revealing the identity of Shakespeare's objects of desire, however, is not Boyd's purpose in writing ""A Waste of Shame."" He is far more interested in Shakespeare the man, and how these lost loves affected his life and his work. Boyd's Shakespeare isn't always admirable; when his shrewish wife Anne calls him a ""whoremonger,"" she's not far wrong. But this Shakespeare obviously is a man of deep, conflicted feelings and burning passions--a man who believably could have written those sonnets and those plays.

""A Waste of Shame"" provides a rare starring role for the much underrated actor Rupert Graves, who with seeming effortlessness persuades us completely of Shakespeare's genius. Also admirable are Indira Varma as Lucie, Tom Sturridge as Will Herbert, Anna Chancellor as Anne, Nicky Henson as Shakespeare's father, Andrew Tiernan as Ben Jonson, Nicholas Rowe as Richard Burbage, Zoe Wanamaker as Herbert's mother, and a very young Tom Hiddleston as Shakespeare's doctor. I wish Boyd had filled in a few more of the blanks in his portrait of Shakespeare--this is one of the very few movies I have wished to be longer--but his presentation of early-17th-century London is persuasive, and the dialogue sounds authentic to the period without leaving modern audiences behind. ""A Waste of Shame"" is a film that deserves to be better known than it is.",1383177600,,1907,5.208469055374593
8601705,2,B00E65M5OY,"Even though this matches exactly my theory-of-sonnets (really based on the intro to the Cambridge University Press 1966 edition of the Sonnets) [...], the execution is so graceless as to make this a waste of money and time. Well, it is almost worth it to see Indira Varma doing a French whore (aka the Dark Lady) with tremendous panache, but all in all, not. Rupert Graves acts like he would rather be anywhere else, probably because the clunky script doesn't help him find his way to his character (yes, only Shakespeare) and more importantly his motivation. In the opening scene, he makes writing sonnets look like misery, rather than (as I imagine), being focused with some detachment, and then tickled by his own trimuphant word-play.  Nor are the sonnets themselves really explored, just snippets.  And it was a shame to see Anna Chancelor, who is so brillant and naunced in The Hour, thrown away on the most one-dimensional and unrealized interpretation of Shakespeare's wife I have ever seen.  A better what-if Shakespeare romp is Tim Curry's 1979 Life of Shakespeare, which opens with a delicious and beautifully deivered double-entendre, which would be impossibly un-PC in today's climate.",1380844800,,1198,5.071065989847716
8601706,1,B00E65M5OY,"I was hoping this would be a way to introduce my students to Shakespeare's sonnets, but it only seemed to have one mood, dark, seedy and depressing. It had none of the multitude of moods of Shakespeare, of which darkness, of course is one, but there is no hint of humor, lightness of touch, soaring love, joy, anything else. It makes the master of many life forces into a very flat and boring character. This man could not have created Falstaff.",1362441600,,445,4.506172839506172
8601707,5,B00E65M5OY,"Why did Shakespeare leave London when he was in his prime?
I always wondered if he had the pox. Apparently, I'm not the only one. Since we know so very little about the bard, any number of theories are worthy of speculation. History or lack of it aside, the film is great. I do believe that the great Rupert Graves can take any character, historical or fictional, and give that person a living, complicated, brilliant and unforgettable persona. The rest of the cast is also excellent. I will watch this film again for all the little bits that I may have missed at the first viewing. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see great acting and an interesting interpretation of the mysterious life of Shakespeare.",1302998400,10,717,4.609375
8601708,5,B00E65M5OY,"This is really a wonderful piece of movie making.  Shakespeare is best known for the plays but anyone who's read the poems has wondered at his raw passion unbridled in the telling of his own lust and longing for both the youth and the dark lady at their core.  It's almost as if this story had to be done to set our minds at a kind of rest so we could return to the poems and truly enjoy their open and brilliant examination of the emotions Shakespeare must have felt as he lived the moments that inspired his written word.  The acting is top notch on all counts. The three leads are played to perfection with a special nod to Tom Sturridge for capturing all the nuances of the lad becoming the man understanding Shakespeare on different levels at each stage of his own development.  He can't top Rupert Graves commanding performance but for one so young he shows an incredibly detailed understanding of his place in this story.  An actor to watch...given the chance he'll go to the top.  Mr. Graves of course has full rein over his Shakespeare and I never for a moment doubted that he wrote those poems.  Indira Varma occupies her bodice with talent rather than physical assets (tho they are formidable) and you can undertand her own torn desires as easily as either of the men, but she, even more than Shakespeare, knows her place in her society and ultimately bases her decisions on the realities of her life. This is something Shakespeare seemed loathe to do yet unlike the other two he had the release of his pen...thus the pressure they must all have felt...he could vent more easily.  If you haven't read the poems this will probably make you do so and that is what really counts in the end...the poems...and their universal emotional relevance....",1293667200,12,1755,4.584664536741214
8601709,5,B00E65M5OY,"Both my daughter & I enjoyed it - and our tastes are quite different at times. Great movie, unexpected delight for a Saturday night movie fest together.",1283731200,,152,4.666666666666667
8601710,5,B00E65M5OY,"From the known facts of Shakespeare's life, scholarly theories and his own imagination, screenwriter/novelist William Boyd has fashioned a fine speculative drama about the creation of the Sonnets. He's done this by projecting the poems' concerns onto the lives of two historical figures, ""Will S."" and ""Will H."" (William Herbert, future Earl of Pembroke), and an invented one, a Frenchwoman named Lucie - the ""Dark Lady."" Yet this 85' TV film is best enjoyed not as an attempted solution to ""The Mystery of Shakespeare and his Sonnets"" (as the subtitle has it) but as a fictional story on themes of love, lust, disease and mortality, and on the relationship between personal experience and artistic creation. And while there is plenty of wit and humor in both script and performances, the choice of title - from Sonnet 129: ""Th'expense of spirit in a waste of shame / Is lust in action..."" - signals the fundamentally serious tone of the project.
 Though handsomely designed and shot, ""A Waste of Shame"" is less a grand period spectacle or costume drama like ""Shakespeare in Love"" than a modest, intimate chamber piece for three actors. Rupert Graves makes a wonderful Will S., suggesting in subtle ways the complex character of a ""country boy"" who has learned the proper way to act (in all senses) in order to further his career in London. In voiceover, Graves reads fragments from the Sonnets, and reads them beautifully, yet some of the most memorable moments are silent, with the camera focused on his highly expressive face. Tom Sturridge as Will H. projects the right air of adolescent androgyny in the early scenes, and later finds a satisfying balance between aristocratic arrogance, seductive charm and deference to artistic genius. Indira Varma conveys both Lucie's sexual allure and her hardheaded practicality convincingly.
 The strong supporting cast (with roughly a dozen named roles) includes Zoe Wanamaker  as a warm Countess of Pembroke, Anna Chancellor an embittered Anne Hathaway, Andrew Tiernan a fiercely competitive Ben Jonson and Ian Hughes as publisher Thomas Thorpe, whose dismay when Will S. brings him poems instead of a play is delightful. John McKay has done a fine job directing, and there's an exceptionally good musical score by Kevin Sargent. In the credits, you will see listed as ""Academic Advisor"" Katherine Duncan-Jones, who as editor has written an excellent introduction to the current Arden Shakespeare edition of the Sonnets. One of the pleasures of ""A Waste of Shame"" is that it may prompt you to (re-)read these extraordinary poems.",1271376000,29,2575,5.111638954869359
