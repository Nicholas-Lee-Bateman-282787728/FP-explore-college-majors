4082015,5,B0037SR3N4,"Finally!  Someone with real-life experience and the talents of composition and production has communicated the real picture!  This is an excellent video of living with depression & bi-polar disorder as told by real men & women with real-life problems. This is the video that will change the way the world sees mental illness, remove the stigma and recognize these as medical problems.",1276300800,15,384,5.17741935483871
4082016,4,B0037SR3N4,"This documentary described the stigma of depression in a very compassionate and enlightening way. The broad range of circumstances that the individuals faced in their day-to-day lives, and the family dynamics that were described, helped make me understand that this is truly an epidemic that is not being acknowledged properly in our society. The very thought of an individual with clinical depression knowing that their current medication could stop working for them and they would have to start all over pains me. After talking with friends that know this first hand, it takes 3-4 weeks for the current meds to leave your system, another 3-4 weeks to start a new set, and you hope to God that in another 3-4 weeks you're in a good place again. This is frightening. The scenes with Peter Yarrow (Peter, Paul & Mary), and the revelations that Diane described were especially moving.",1273622400,16,882,4.966216216216216
4082017,5,B0037SR3N4,Should be seen by everyone!!!!! Those who do not suffer with depression have no Idea what those that do deal with.,1361404800,,114,4.476190476190476
4082018,5,B0037SR3N4,"This was an informative documentary.  I have used it on my unit for clients dealing with depression.  I enjoyed the individual stories and the positive outcomes experienced by the individual stories in the video.  Depression affects individuals from all cultures, ages and economic backgrounds.  I felt it dealt with depression accurately through the stories of those affected with this mental illness.",1359072000,,402,5.540983606557377
4082019,5,B0037SR3N4,"Great teaching tool.  I like how it shows all cultures, because there is depression everywhere and this shows you that it can happen to any and everyone.",1358899200,,153,4.666666666666667
4082020,4,B0037SR3N4,"I was seeking out some kind of documentary that could explain what depression technically is, how it feels, that it's a real disease, how to help, etc, etc for some family that don't understand or can't relate. This documentary was 95% of what I was looking for to show my family.",1358121600,4,280,4.509803921568627
4082021,3,B0037SR3N4,"This video did not make a big impression upon me.  It was well done, but I expected more.  I believe that if you are looking for information about a mental illness, a collection of information is better than one source only.  I have no better suggestion at this time.",1353369600,2,267,4.408163265306122
4082022,5,B0037SR3N4,"This excellent documentary brings human faces and situations into the light and offers an unblinking look at a potentially devastating illness. I appreciated the lack of pat answers, bumper sticker slogans, and canned ""magic"" that seems to pervade so many other resources.",1348790400,2,272,5.5
4082023,5,B0037SR3N4,Excellent! Just what I needed and exactly what my family needs to understand and cope better with the torment of  this illness.,1343260800,2,127,4.7727272727272725
4082024,5,B0037SR3N4,"I bought this to use for a group to educate people about depression, and it was well received. People can identify with the problems and stigma of depression. It was spot on in many ways that resonated with the depression support group I am in. Don't just keep it to yourself, share with friends, family, neighbors.",1336867200,,315,4.642857142857143
4082025,5,B0037SR3N4,"My husband I were watching PBS one evening when we caught this documentary. This film impacted us powerfully because of the expressive, emotional individual stories told by those who have had firsthand experience with the long-lasting effects of depression. In just an hour's time, we felt that we had a much better understanding of a disease (just the word ""depression"" causes most people ""dis-ease"") that descends mercilessly on people of all ages. A dear friend of mine has an adult son who has fought this disease for many years. What is even more wounding than his pain is the abject apathy of those around her who tell her that he  just needs to  ""snap out of it.""  Depression isn't a ""respectable"" disease so we are too often muted by our ignorance to offer solace or understanding. I bought the film for her so that she can begin to educate those around her but I wish that EVERYONE would see this film.  What truly stunned me was learning that the producer of the film is the very talented Susan Polis Schutz!  I recognized her name immediately from her Blue Mountain Arts line of cards which I sought out for years.  Her messages on those cards were tender, moving, reaching-into-the-depths-of-your-heart expressions for loved ones and she always managed to put into beautiful words what so many find difficult to articulate.  How she penned messages that were virtual insights to our souls - while battling overwhelming depression - is beyond my comprehension. She has apparently devoted herself to helping others understand the darkness of depression and I admire her even more for those efforts. The more we understand, the better able we are to reach out just as we would with a disease more familiar to us.",1303171200,26,1721,4.833333333333333
4082026,4,B0037SR3N4,"I purchased this to help my family members understand what my sister is going through, as they really didn't know how to handle depression. It helped open their eyes to see it from the perspective of someone suffering from depression.",1289088000,5,234,4.875

8390731,5,B0037SR3N4,"Gifted to my friend whos having side effects having to now take.... Paxil and many more like it thru the years and she suffers from Bipolar. This gives her a way to explain it to her husband who just calls her,"" lazy"". When I watched this, I heard her very words repeated here on this dvd.

8390733,3,B0037SR3N4,"I've shown this video to my patients many times in the educational groups. It can be very depressing to watch. Lots of people say that they feel worse after watching it. Also, there is patients, who discuss their struggles with finding the meds that work for them and their anger towards the psychiatrists, who prescribe their meds. It can create havoc in your group, so, be cautious.",1420588800,2,384,4.746268656716418

8390736,5,B0037SR3N4,"This is the best, most open, honest, significant look at depression I have ever come across.  I have bi-polar myself, and am sharing the dvd with family to give them a better look at the illness and its many effects.

So glad to own this important dvd.",1379116800,3,252,4.340425531914893
8390737,3,B0037SR3N4,I only gave this DVD 3 stars as it did not actually give much insight into depression.  It described how some people feel during the depression stages......it only gave the similar feelings of what people experience during depression but no solutions or suggestions on how they got over their problems.........Sophia,1370995200,4,316,5.32
