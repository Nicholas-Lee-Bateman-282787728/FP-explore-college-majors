7922413,5,B00004TB0I,"This a very well done film about children on the rivers and broads of eastern England in the 1930s, trying to save the nests of river birds from boorish tourists, hence the title.  A young brother and sister from the London area are sent to visit a family friend who has a sailing yacht on one of the rivers. They befriend a local youngster fleeing the wrath of the tourists whose boat he had moved from a nesting site of coots.  He teaches them the joys and complexities of boating on the rivers and broads and they meet his friends, all while trying to avoid the vengeful tourists.  The climax comes when they all run aground during a fog on the bay and their friends show the tourists the meaning of compassion.  The film presents the era very well and follows the book very closely, with only the editing necessary to fit into a feature length film.  I thought the twin girls were a little younger than described in the book, but I think the producers did well to find twin actresses anywhere near the right age.  A very enjoyable film .",1468540800,,1041,4.395833333333333
7922414,5,B00004TB0I,First read the Swallows and Amazons novels more than 40 years ago. I was happy to find out that they have stood up well over the intervening years; this is one series that has NOT been visited by the 'suck fairy' as the saying goes,1453075200,,231,4.155555555555556
7922415,5,B00004TB0I,"I'm sure there are lots of things wrong with this movie ... I just don't know any of them. This DVD was bought to replace an earlier VHS version bought in the late 90s from Newport, RI's Armchair Sailor bookstore for our very young daughter ... along with the Big Six. The VHS versions went south after having been frequently used as rainy-day videos at a local historic marine museum summer sailing camp.
These are lovely, innocent period movies that take an historic look at a simpler time in England through the lens of Arthur Ransome's Swallows & Amazons tales. Whether or not they're accurate against the books is irrelevant, it seems to me. They are, in spirit, right on target & the characters and plots are perfect for a time that's nearly impossible to imagine today.
We controlled our daughter's TV/video viewing for as long as possible, & I did not get the sense that these were favorites of hers. She tells me now that I was very wrong ... she loves them dearly & will pop them in every now and again when she wants to relive her early sailing experiences.",1420329600,,1068,4.538860103626943
7922416,4,B00004TB0I,British TV must have done a series on the Ransome books.  Coot Club not my favorite but a nice story.  Transaction was fine.,1403308800,,124,4.3478260869565215
7922417,2,B00004TB0I,"After reading previous reviews I was very disappointed in this DVD. The storyline was fairly true to the Ransome book although being only 90 mins a lot was missed out and I don't think had I not read the book that I could have understood all that was going on. Some of the footage could of birds, in flight, or nesting etc. was too long add didn't really add to the story. The sound quality was very poor, I had to continually adjust up and down",1386028800,,445,4.186046511627907
7922418,5,B00004TB0I,"I have read and re-read all of Arthur Ransoms Books with the Swallows & Amazons,and enjoyed them very much. The Coot Club TV/Movie version portrayed the books so well.  Made in the 1980's but portrayed the 1930's was well done and some good acting by the younger cast. If you wish to turn back the clock to those lovely days without TV's and computer games and escape to 'simpler' times and to the back waters of rural England, and are still a kid a heart, then this is for you.",1361577600,,478,4.311111111111111
7922419,5,B00004TB0I,"My husband had this on VHS and loved it as a great entertaining family movie.  So, when we got rid of our video player when we moved and replaced it only with a DVD player, I bought this for him and he loved watching it again.  Thank you for the prompt delivery.",1359590400,,262,4.019230769230769
7922420,4,B00004TB0I,"I don't like this episode as much as the 2nd (Swallows & Amazons), but wanted the grandsons to have the first one to see whether they liked it.  Oh my gosh!  They've been raving about it, watching it multiple times, ""can't believe I wasted my summer NOT learning how to sail!""  Begging their parents to buy them a sailboat - they live on Puget Sound...So I guess the 2nd episode will be on its way to them ASAP  :)",1345075200,,414,4.2025316455696204
7922421,5,B00004TB0I,"This video, and it's pair, ""The Big Six"" are great.  My 9 year old daughters and my wife and I really love these.  They do a great job capturing the feeling of the Ransom stories.  While my daughters and I are currently reading the Ransom stories, I think these videos would be great for virtually any child.  The combination of relating to the independance of the children and a vision of a different, simpler time make these videos very appealing.  I can't recommend these enough!",1010448000,3,482,4.623529411764705
7922422,5,B00004TB0I,"That is the word ""delightful"" for the books and the video.  They are technically childrens stories, but they are fun, and well acted.",977788800,5,133,4.782608695652174
