2476093,1,B000E0LLEA,"UFC 58 is full of decisons decision and more decisions.  On top of that, Zuffa decidedly to idioticly dub the title of this event ""USA vs Canada"" meaning that you have drunk buffoons chanting ""USA"" in every fight.  That main event is basically one man fighting while the other runs away for 25 minutes.  You can tell that these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.

Pride FC is the top organization in the world.  Sadly, the UFC is far behind.",1152403200,,512,4.462365591397849

Mandalay Bay Events Center, Nevada

UFC 58 lays out a great fight card. We have the highly anticipated return of ""The Prodigy"", BJ Penn and a title bout between Rich Franklin and David Louseau. Along with some other good matchups, this promised to be another exciting UFC event that would contribute to the meteoric rise of MMA in mainstream media.

Yves Edwards v. Mark Hominick:
These are two very strong strikers with excellent speed going head to head. The fight surprisingly ends with a submission! This was the first time I'd seen Mark Hominick in action.  He should do very well in the UFC lightweight division...

Joe Doerksen v. Nate Marquardt:
This is an even matchup... even their MMA fighting records are nearly identical. They provide some good action throughout the fight. It ultimately goes to a decision.

BJ ""The Prodigy"" Penn v. Georges ""Rush"" St. Pierre:
The Prodigy returns to the UFC and takes on the top contender in the welterweight division. St. Pierre, in my opinion, has been the champion in waiting since he lost to Matt Hughes. He has taken down every single opponent he has faced since then - and made them look bad in the process. BJ Penn is obviously an amazing fighter, so I was looking forward to this fight even more than the main event here at UFC 58. The fight begins and GSP is poked in the eye early on. He begins bleeding (a sight we are not used to seeing) and appears to lose the 1st round to Penn. He comes back strong during the fight, but it remains fairly close in a mostly standing bout. This fight goes to a split decision and the better, more talented fighter, I believe, is indeed awarded the victory.

Mike ""Quick"" Swick v. Steve Vinegault:
Mike Swick is coming off the hype of winning his first 2 UFC fights. He comes out to 2Pac and lives up to his nickname, ""Quick""... Pretty bad@ss.

Rich ""Ace"" Franklin v. David ""The Crow"" Louseau:
Louseau is very deserving of this title shot. He has had many impressive performances in the octagon - and his time finally comes on this night, at this event... Franklin intends to dominate the middleweight division and he certainly has the skills to stay on top. Franklin looks good in the 1st round. He loves to stand and Louseau appears to be caught and hurt a few times. This is an exciting fight throughout, although it is pretty one-sided, with the exception of a brief moment in the 3rd round. Franklin breaks his hand in the 2nd round, yet it doesn't appear to hamper his performance too significantly. He looks great against a great opponent and makes a mess of Louseau's face with his striking. This fight is a war.

Great event. Great matchups. Highly recommended!",1150761600,13,2697,4.615866388308977

USA VS CANADA

This was the event that the UFC held that pit US fighters against those from Canada, and for the most part it was a good event. Of course like another time BJ Penn would get cheated in my opinion. I don't think their should really be a country vs country thing going on in MMA because it is [Mixed Martial Arts] and that is styles from all over the world that every fighter has to be well rounded in, this isn't wrestling [which I love] that can have a story line like this. Any way this event would see the first BJ Penn vs GSP fight and still to this day I believe that Penn won, that is just me though.

1. ICHO LARENAS VS TOM MURPHY-we get a good first round with back and forth action and we even get our first blood of the night. A decent first round with Tom coming out on top I think. The second round starts with Icho getting taken down by Tom, Tom controls from the top for most of this. The rest of the round is them getting stood up and Tom getting the take down. The third round looks just like the second one with Tom winning by a referee stoppage, USA takes this one I guess. 4/5

2. ROB MACDONALD VS JASON LAMBERT-the fight starts out with these two just banging away at each other with Jason swinging for the fences. Then Jason slams Rob hard but both pop up right after that, but once they are back on the ground Jason sinks in a nice kimura. This is an excellent but short fight, nice and exciting and USA takes another. 5/5

3. SAM STOUT VS SPENCER FISHER-the first round starts with Fisher just coming in and taking Sam down, but he gets up quick. Fisher throws Sam masterfully but gets nailed as Sam is coming back up, then they trade blows. These two guys battle it out standing and on the ground for the entire round, great first round. The second round is just like the first and is very close, and Fisher try's some nice submissions, excellent second round. The third round is just as exciting as the first and second and they even show some good sportsmanship when one losses his mouth piece. The fight goes to a split decision and Sam Stout ends up taking this hard fought battle, Canada takes this one. 5/5

4. MARK HOMINICK VS YVES EDWARDS-if you are an MMA fan then you know who Yves Edwards is, he is a deadly man in the octagon. Good first round between these two as they exchange blows for the entire round and stay in the clinch for a good amount of time while throwing some blows. In the second round Yves takes this to the ground after he is rocked but Mark lays in a tight triangle choke and forces Yves to tap, great fight, Canada takes this one. 4.5/5

5. JOE DOERKSEN VS NATHAN MARQUADT-these two came to entertain the crowd in this fight as they both just go at it full force. Both deliver a great stand up game and also go at it on the ground, great first round. These two put on another great showing in the second round as both take the other down and sweep each other, and go blow for blow. The second round is just as competitive as the first, maybe more so. The third round is just like the previous two as Nathan Marquadt takes the victory for the USA.5/5

6. BJ PENN VS GEORGE ST. PIERRE-this fight was to see who would be taking on Matt Hughes for the welterweight title, GSP wanted to avenge himself against Hughes and BJ wanted his belt back that he never lost. An excellent first round as these two just throw blows with each other and GSP get s bloodied pretty bad. A wonderful first round that BJ takes as he lands the most shots, and bloodied GSP. The second round is extremely exciting and if you really look at it this is a very close round. They both are very close on the striking but BJ lands more times clean were as GSP gets most of his punches and kicks check by BJ, but GSP did deliver some nice strikes particularly a high kick. The debate comes in were the take downs are concerned and it is very close as well, really think about it. GSP gets two take downs on Penn one of quick is right before the round ends, and while he gets points for that fighters are also judged on their defense and what they do from the bottom. BJ gets up after the first showing amazing defense and recovery time and on the second one kept working angles preventing GSP from doing any real damage. The call is yours on who won that masterfully crafted second round. The third round is full of suspense and when I was watching it live I was getting really anxious and awaiting what the final verdict would be. As far as striking goes it is another even looking fight but Penn lands the cleanest blows, and both getting take downs two for GSP and one for Penn. That right there evens it up in my mind but after GSP's second take down he gets caught in an uma plata attempt and then a gogoplata submission attempt. Once again it is your call but by my scoring that makes it a 3 to 2 round for Penn, the two of the three judges thought differently, Canada takes this one by split decision. This was an outstanding fight no matter who you were rooting for, I love both of these guys so I was happy but I still feel like Penn won this fight even if by the littlest bit. 5/5

7. STEVE VIGNEAULT VS MICK SWICK-this is a pretty good fight as both exchange blows for most of the first round, with it looking pretty even. But around half way through the first round Steve shoots in and is caught up in a tight guillotine choke and Swick the victory for the US, good but short fight. 4/5

8.[MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP]-RICH FRANKLIN VS DAVID LOISEAU-this was the biggest fight of Franklin's career since Ken Shamrock in my mind because these two are very similar, great stand up and explosive fighters. Pretty good first round as they pretty much feel each other out with some nice exchanges and combos but Rich gets the upper hand, he even drops David right as the round ends. The second round ends up looking much like the first round as Rich dominates the match and even gets on top of David twice. The third round is a little more exciting as David drops Rich and starts to give it to him, but Rich recovers and gets back into the fight. Also Rich has his back at one point, still Rich takes the round, very good round. The fourth round looks much like the first two as Rich controls this fight for the most part. The final round is another Franklin round as he controls most of this round, but still it goes the distance and Rich keeps his belt and gets a win for the US.4/5

This was a pretty good event that saw competitors from the US and Canada go at it, and in my opinion saw BJ Penn defeat GSP in a close fight.

There is a great behind the scenes feature that shows Penn coming back to the UFC, as well as other things.",1234051200,,6687,4.21640625
8103137,5,B000E0LLEA,"This was a great event! Everyone is complaining about half the card going to decision but those fights were the best ones on the dvd! Rich Franklin is one of the best fighters ever to step into the octagon and he shows his dominance in his fight with Loiseau. I guess GSP vs Bj Penn turned out to be an upset because everyone was expecting the prodigy to win! The card also features Yves Edwards, Mike Swick, Sam Stout, and Spencer Fisher! Don't let the other reviews fool you, this was a great event so buy it now to add to your UFC collection!",1208995200,4,545,4.25
8103138,4,B000E0LLEA,"This is a great UFC card for the fights themselves.  They are all action packed and interesting.  While several of the fights go to the decision, in most cases they were very close calls.  This card also introduces two very exciting new (to the UFC) Canadian fighters Sam Stout and Mark Hominick.

Unfortunately, this may very well be the poorest quality modern day UFC DVD yet.  For starters, literally everything but the fights is cut out, no post fight interviews, no commentary between matches, or anything like that.  In addition, the quality of the filming itself is clearly off, it's as if it's a bootleg copy.  This will be immediately obvious open viewing of the DVD.

In any event, it's still not to be missed for the fights.",1167264000,,735,4.6875
8103139,4,B000E0LLEA,"With the title dubbed ""USA vs. Canada"", it was a Canadian fighter who won the crowd over with his comeback performance and post-fight speech in which got on his hands and knee's and begged for his title shot. George St. Pierre's popularity sky rocketed in this event. This was the event where he went from a fighter to a star. He didn't have to overcome the crowd who was partial for both BJ Penn and himself, what he had to do was overcome the former Welterweight champion, BJ Penn. St. Pierre showed great heart after taking a beating in the first round as BJ was one step ahead of him through the round. But BJ seemed to have relaxed and let the final 2 rounds go to St. Pierre, which led to St. Pierre getting his rematch with Matt Hughes, which is a topic that'll be discussed another time.

The fight of the night in my opinion was Nathan Marquardt vs. Joe Doerksen. Marquardt was boo'ed in his UFC debut when he faced Ivan Salaverry in the inaugural ""Ultimate Fight Night"", but didn't dissappoint this time around. Doerksen lived up to his word by keeping this fight from being dull/boring. These 2 went toe-to-toe on the ground and standing. They were timid at first, but they let their hands fly as the fight progressed and the ground game was fantastic.

The other fight that I loved was Spencer Fisher vs. Sam Stout. Stout's original opponent was Kenny Florian who was forced off of the card due to a back injury during training. On short notice, literally 2 days, Fisher made the cut from 170lbs+ down to 155lbs. Fisher dominated the first round, but the short notice and weight cutting took it's toll in the final 2 rounds. A valiant effort by both men which took the fight to a split decision....great fight, other nominee for fight of the night by die hard fans.

In this event, you can see one man run 2.7 miles in one fight. David Loiseau looked more like a cross country runner than a mixed martial artist. You can't blame him, he was out-gunned by the stronger, hungrier, and more skilled defending Middleweight champion Rich Franklin.",1166140800,,2054,4.545945945945946
8103140,5,B000E0LLEA,"This has a great battle between Rich Franklin and #1 contender David Loiseau.  5 rounds of full action.  It's funny are the only 2 negative reviewers is from jenspulver11 and masakatsufunaki7.  Who seem to only obsess and write negative reviews about the ufc.  Look at there review history.  It looks like all these two do when they are bored is look for ufc DVD's to write bad reviews on.  Pride is a great organization but ufc puts on way better shows.  Yes pride does have better fighters but none are as interesting as the fighters in the UFC, except for just a few in the Pride organization.  It seems all those two other reviews just love to obsess about pride and probably *** it to Mirko ""Cro Cop."" You two *** need to go get a life.  He better yet just go *** each other. Last I remember is that Jens Pulver established his career in the UFC so obviously you must like the ufc with a name like jenspulver11.  Anyway enough ranting about those to *** bags.  This is a great UFC card with some memorable fights.  Definitely worth your time to check this one out.",1156723200,5,1069,4.370558375634518

They fight in a caged octagon not a boxing ring. On pride the action is always stopped then restarted when they are on the ropes, I am suprised they don't fall through the ropes more often. The ring announcers speak Japanese not english.

Anyway this fight card is excellent, and the fights are always action packed.",1152921600,9,468,4.571428571428571
