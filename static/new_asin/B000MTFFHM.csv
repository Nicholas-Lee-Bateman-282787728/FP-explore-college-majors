You see the fury and passion in a human spirit unwilling to be dominated. Meiko is a terrific actress. What was most impressive to us was the inventiveness in the plot and and direction of the storyline in each one considering when these movies were made. I do recommend getting the missing #2 in the series and watching them in order. I thanks the previous posters who steered me to do this. Glad I did.

Each one is unique and watching them one after the other is a bit of a treat.",1304640000,2,636,4.170731707317073
8171978,3,B000MTFFHM,"The three films in this set are excellent, absolute classics of the genre.  But because this set is incomplete, what is the point?  They should be watched in order to really understand the story, and to see Nami's experiences in the order in which they played out.  However ""Jailhouse 41,"" the second film is missing.  So when you watch the first film, and then skip to the third, (Beast Stable) it makes no sense, because it starts out with ""The Scorpion"" outside of jail.  Part 1 ended with Nami being returned to prison after dispatching the men who raped her, and the cop who used her.  Not to mention, many consider the missing film to be the best of the series, and is certainly the most artistic.  I believe there are copyright problems with ""Jailhouse 41,"" because it is never available.  This is a fine set, but i just don't see the point of it being released with the middle part of the story missing.  why did they bother?",1276560000,7,933,4.4733727810650885
