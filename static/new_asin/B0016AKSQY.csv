3154868,4,B0016AKSQY,"This is indeed a great movie by director John Sayles, that sometimes reminds of ""Hallelujah"" with its almost all-black cast and the central place it gives to music. But the atmosphere and point are completely different and unique, meandering through comedy, suspense and romance. Most enjoyable!",1247616000,,295,5.434782608695652
3154869,5,B0016AKSQY,"I really liked how John Sayles went about making this movie and the acting
was very impressive. There are plently of sub plots that are going on while the main plot unfolds and to give some props to the director and the actors they pull it off without a hitch. This movie is a pleasure to watch
and I recommend the movie Honeydripper highly.",1245888000,,341,4.34375
3154870,4,B0016AKSQY,"In an era when the southern blues are giving way to rock and roll,
this is a story of a small cotton town.
The young guitar player comes in riding the rails, the older piano player is running (badly) the honeydipper club.
The story is about the coming together of the forces in the town to make something new.
""Time to make way for what is coming next.""
I liked the plot and the music here.",1233619200,,390,4.144736842105263
3154871,3,B0016AKSQY,"This is the first film I've seen by John Sayles, whom I've heard good things about over the years. Unfortunately it will be my last. Other reviewers refer to this film as ""leisurly paced"" and ""takes time with character development."" The scenes ARE played far too slow, the actors need to pick up the pace, the edits need to move faster. I gave it a chance, I sat through the entire thing, but not only was it boring, it was predictable. I was drawn to this movie due to the subject matter, but it was highly unrealistic. Despite its PG13 rating this IS a family picture, pure ""fabricated history"" ala Walt Disney television movies from the early 60s. This is a good movie for families with young children who wish to create revisionist history for their kids to protect them from the harsh realities of the Black experience in the American Rural South of the early 1950s. Overall the acting is good, the characters are well cast, but it's obvious they were encouraged with their slow delivery of lines to the point where it almost seems Gary Clark Jr. is actually trying to remember his next line. During the opening credits it says written, directed and edited by John Sayles...it would have been better if someone else had edited the film and would have been better still if someone else had directed it.",1232755200,2,1306,4.609442060085837
3154872,5,B0016AKSQY,"I saw Honeydripper last year and really enjoyed it a lot. It isn't your regular hollywood film. I haven't seen many of John Sayles' films but will probably check them out. Don't want to spoil anything, it's a really good film! :)",1229212800,,229,4.476190476190476
3154873,5,B0016AKSQY,"Having lived in the south for many years, ""Honeydripper"" was a nostalgic trip for us. Thought the acting excellent for the most part. Certainly the setting rang true. There is a long wait for the music, but the reward is worth it.",1217980800,6,230,4.5
3154874,5,B0016AKSQY,"John Sayles is a true independant filmmaker who not only finances, directs, edits and writes his movies but often times acts in and writes music for them. For ""Honeydripper"" Sayles did it all, and he wrote a couple of songs. He has dealt with the African American experience in movies before like: ""Brother From Another Planet"", ""Passion Fish"" and ""City of Hope"", but since most of the characters in ""Honeydripper"" are black he delves even deeper into the issue and the film is written more like a play with echoes of the work of August Wilson.
It's 1950 in the deep South and Danny Glover's Tyrone is barely making it and his Honeydripper lounge featuring aging blues players can't compete with the popular Jukejoint next door. To make matters worse the Honeydripper is about to close down unless Tyrone can come up with some serious money.
Most of the story revolves around the conflicts and relationships Tyrone has with his wife ( a powerful performance by Lisa Gay Hamilton), his partner (an excellent Charles Dutton), his daughter (a nice debut by model Ya Ya DeCosta), a young musician stranger (effectively played by young bluesman Gary Clark Jr.) and the white sheriff (a tailor made role for Stacey Keach). My favorite character is played by veteran bluesman Keb' Mo', a sort of bluesy greek chorus muse who appears at pivotal times only to Glover and Clark.
Sayles always takes his time developing his characters and the world in which they live, and though it may seem slow at first this lets you begin to care about what will happen to them. A big plus is the terrific music, and except for Glover, it is all played by the actors themselves and surprisingly it was all done live while filming.
Yes the movie, like a play, takes it's time to develop, but the payoff was one of the most uplifting times I've had at the movies in a long while.
I read that Sayles has decided to stop making movies and just write. I'm sure it must be getting harder to get these kinds of movies made and harder still to get them released, unfortunately no one makes movies like John Sayles.",1215820800,36,2082,4.629729729729729
3154875,5,B0016AKSQY,"John Sayles, perhaps more than any other American filmmaker, has his finger on the pulse of what make this country special.  A gifted storyteller, not one of his films is alike, but hes's at his best when he takes a small moment in time and uses it to explore a major change.  EIGHT MEN OUT uses the Black Sox scandal to reflect the loss of innocence of our nation.  LONE STAR uses a murder mystery to unearth skeletons long hidden, etc.  With HONEYDRIPPER, Sayles latest, he explores the moment Blues Became Electric, opening the door for Rock & Roll, the dominant music of the last half of the 20th Century.  He does so in the style of the late August Wilson, using quiet rhythms and essentially one locale to tell the story.  In the process, he gets allows his stellar cast to deliver some great performances, including Danny Glover, Charles S. Dutton, Keb Mo, Vondie Curtis-Hall and newcomer YaYa Dacosta, as China Doll.  Gary Clark, Jr. is a little stiff in his acting debut, but once he picks up the guitar, he puts a smile on your face.  Parts of the story may move a little slow, but Honeydripper's built for comfort, not for speed.  Once you know the plot, you'll begin to pick out minor details in the fabric of the film that absolutely glow.  Mind you, this is a film that could never be made within the Hollywood studio system, so if you're looking for Rush Hour 3, then move along.  But if you like a good story told well or just love the Blues, Honeydripper deserves a spot on your personal video shelf.",1214870400,18,1517,4.4601449275362315

The story line and the dialog left a lot to be desired, but the actors made up for that by delivering strong performances.  Danny Glover and Charles Dutton were believable in their roles and sold their characters.  If you like blues and early Rock n Roll, this is the movie for you.  By the end of the movie I got into the rhythm with the movie and enjoyed the time I spent watching it.",1485388800,,494,4.051546391752577

3154934,5,B0016AKSQY,"I didn't expect to enjoy this movie half as much as I did.  It was really excellent and I am not one to heap unwarranted praise on anything.  I have a strong disapproval of Danny Glover due to his politics, but I must admit he is an excellent actor and he manages to keep his politics out of the movies I've seen him in.  This story is about the owner of a black-owned bar called the ""Honeydripper.""  Since the owner is under financial duress and is about to be foreclosed on, he needed a big event that would bring in a large chunk of money over the weekend so that he could pay off his loan by Monday.  So he advertises beginning the week before that he will have the celebrity ""Sam the Guitar Man"" as entertainment over the weekend.  It turns out that ""Sam"" is indisposed and fails to turn up, so the bar owner grabs a drifter with a homemade guitar to stand in and pretend to be ""Sam.""  As it turned out, the drifter was a big fan of Sam's and knew all of his music very well, and he turned out to be an excellent guitar player.  When the people heard him play, several other townsfolk joined in and formed a band around the pseudo-Sam.  They had piano, saxophone, drums, accompanying the drifter.  The folks enjoyed the music and so did I.  In the end, the loan shark let the cat out of the bag that the drifter wasn't Sam, but by then the locals no longer cared, they liked this guy and his music.  In the end, the bar owner was able to pay off his debt on time.",1485216000,6,1468,4.130281690140845

3154941,5,B0016AKSQY,"Honeydripper was a little gem in the John Sayles catalog of film making. He has a unique style of story telling and his characters are always complex and nuanced. Danny Glover as Tyrone, trying to make a go of his little club against all odds has you rooting for him with all his human flaws. The performances from Charles Dutton,Lisa Gay Hamilton, Stacy Keach, Yaya Charles, Gary Clark and a slew of supporting cast bring to life the dilemmas of the black man's struggles in the Deep South of the 50's. The music is a vital part of bringing this story to life as well. Keb Mo almost steals the show as Possum. Very enjoyable and the music was a blast.

By not giving up they each have opportunities for each other. You will need to watch to see how it plays out both musically and dramatically. This could be any time period but it is the 50s and situated in the South and is the Southern Blues of the Juk era. Danny Glover delivers, as usual, a great performance.

Danny Glover as Tyrone, trying to make a go of his little club against all odds has you rooting for him with all his human flaws. The performances from Charles Dutton,Lisa Gay Hamilton, Stacy Keach, Yaya Charles, Gary Clark and a slew of supporting cast bring to life the dilemmas of the black man's struggles in the Deep South of the 50's.  The music is a vital part of bringing this story to life as well. Keb Mo almost steals the show as Possum. Very enjoyable and the music was a blast.

Banksters and gangsters loaning money.  24 hours left to pay the debts when an unknown, hotshot guitar playing singer is drug out of the cotton fields and to the stage at the last minute to save the day and win the girl.

This movie seems to have been written for the stage.  There's only few sets in which most of the action takes place and most of the action is dialogue between 2-3 characters.  Unfortunately, in the end it was just too hard for me to continue to listen to Danny Glover's raspy, whispery delivery.  My hearing's not too good these days so most of the time I never understood what he was saying.

However, having said all that, Guy Clark Jr., the unknown, cotton pickin guitarist, makes the movie worth watching.  It was worth the price to hear him play.",1441584000,4,836,4.483443708609271

Tyrone, or Pine Top as he's known, plies his trade at the Honeydripper Lounge.  PineTop owes just about everybody including the landlord.

Purvis claims to have hired a big name guitar player in order to lure more customers in.  Nothing is that simple.  Plans go off their mark and Tyrone has to improvise.  Charles S. Dutton and Stacey Keach also star.

It was a bit short, but it ended well. I have purchased this movie to send to a friend. I watched it from a Netflix rental after seeing about 6 minutes of it on a recording following a movies that I taped on television. I wished that I had set the tape time to continue but I saw enough to know that I wanted to see more and so I rented it. The movie covered many areas of life in its depiction of the down home south backwoods of the south. The wooden juke house, lazy dialogue, injustice, death, laughter, music, flashbacks, hominess, church and everything country was a delight. I grew up in the dirt of the country in the Delta of Mississippi and the word ""Delta"" is mentioned in the movie. I never experienced all the things like in the movie, except I know what a field of cotton feels like and looks like (I was there once or twice) and I know how hot the sun is in those fields. This movie is refreshing because it's not really predictable, but it is a little bit mainly because the scenes aren't predictably set up, but if you comprehend what's going on you will nod your head to what happens next.",1359072000,4,1269,4.24793388429752

3155155,2,B0016AKSQY,"I was looking very forward to this movie, the cover made me think it would be about a guy playing cigar box guitar, but no, its some sort of modern looking pseudo-hobbled-together guitar.  It uses modern cigar box pickups with an Epiphone or Gibson neck.  Check out wikipedia to get an idea of what was happening in guitars in 30's to 50's.

Aside from that, the first half hour is full of cliches - did the writer actually do any research on Alabama in the 1950's?  Not even a trace of accent, a mixture of 30's and 70's clothing, the actors use phrasings which are contemporary.  I laughed for the first 45 mins or so.

The whole thing rolls out like a 50's version of ""Booty Time"", except Booty time was a lot funnier.  Should I say, somebody's fantasy of the 50's?

The entire plot ""situation"" is painfully foreshadowed, we know from the first 15 minutes how this is going to end.

The whitey sheriff who likes Glover's wife's cooking (apparently she invents KFC), reminds you of ""Smokey and The Bandit"", which may have served as research material.

What movie about blacks would be complete without a rich white women donating an un-useable dress to her maid: I was surprised it wasn't torn, but it was too small...

There were a few genuine moments, but this movie is a bit too Disney - a fantasy world somebody cooked up.  Some of the scenes have a surreal look and the featuring of a few big name performers was nice.",1300060800,,1425,4.48062015503876

Danny Glover was made for the part and Stacy Keach was unforgettable as the sheriff. I would put this in a class like ""Cinema Paradiso"", just a gem of a movie.

3155160,5,B0016AKSQY,"I love movies that provide insight in how 20th-century American music developed in the transitional period between the heyday of blues and the coming of rock and roll! It's fascinating to see, looking back, how people were dumbfounded at the idea of an electric guitar (""How does it make a sound? There's no soundhole!"") The 50's and 60's were definitely the most exciting decades for being a musician--new ideas, musical styles and technology were developing at rapid speeds all over the place. What this movie does is provide an insight in how these kind of changes impacted a smalltown community in the south in 1950. The famous Guitar Sam (a character very obviously inspired by real blues artist Guitar Slim) backs out on a gig at the Honeydripper. No problem, some local upstart kid with an electric guitar can fill in for him--as Guitar Sam! The people in the community are so technologically deprived that they don't even know what Guitar Sam looks like, even though they eagerly flock to the club to see him perform!

Danny Glover does a great job in portraying the down-on-his-luck club owner, who needs to free himself of debt and his own demons stemming from an incident in his past. Keb Mo also does a great job in playing the guitar-playing character who embodies these demons.

Great music from Keb Mo and the other artists who supply the music. The piano playing during the end credits is some of the best blues piano playing you will ever hear! Fantastic! Great movie! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1256428800,7,1505,4.806949806949807
3155161,4,B0016AKSQY,"In the recent past in this space I have gone on and on about the old country blues performed after a hard, hard week's work on a Saturday in the local `juke joints' down in the southern United States in places like rural Mississippi and Alabama before World War II. Of course, then the music took the road north, especially after the war and got electrified to fit the needs of the new black migration that was heading up river to find work (and get the hell away from Jim Crow) in the newly unionized (in most cases) industrial plants. But what about those left behind, or those who did not or could not go north? Or just wanted to, or had to, keep away from the cities with their treacherous ways? Answering those questions, in a nutshell, forms the plotline to this entertaining little saga about the trials and tribulations of modernization, blues version.

Okay, here is the plot line. A struggling juke joint owner, Pine Top Purvis (also the house piano player), played by star Danny Glover, is financially in deep trouble and needs a quick fix to keep the wolves from the door. Nothing seems to be working for the man, especially when a regionally well-known early R&B hot shot who is suppose to resolve all Danny's financial problems is a no show. Not to worry, an itinerant R&B wannabe just happens to ride the blinds into town, gets himself into trouble (mainly for being black while seeking a work-some things never change), and in the end is Danny's salvation by performing a successful  Saturday gig  and saving the day.

Along the way we also get small glimpse of black rural life including, naturally, the ardors of plantation life, -that means cotton picking, the tough times of small time musical talents, the role of the religious tent revival in rural life and needless to say, the confinements, large and small, of Jim Crow, physically, mentally and spiritually. I have reviewed plenty of film documentaries in this space that touch on the blues and the social milieu that it derived from. While those vehicles still give a historically more accurate account of what went into create that special blues idiom just before it got electrified this film is not a bad take on what that was all about- a little prettified up to be sure.",1249344000,,2250,4.659949622166247
3389365,4,B0016AKSQY,"This is indeed a great movie by director John Sayles, that sometimes reminds of ""Hallelujah"" with its almost all-black cast and the central place it gives to music.

3389368,3,B0016AKSQY,"This is the first film I've seen by John Sayles, whom I've heard good things about over the years. Unfortunately it will be my last. Other reviewers refer to this film as ""leisurly paced"" and ""takes time with character development."" The scenes ARE played far too slow, the actors need to pick up the pace, the edits need to move faster. I gave it a chance, I sat through the entire thing, but not only was it boring, it was predictable. I was drawn to this movie due to the subject matter, but it was highly unrealistic. Despite its PG13 rating this IS a family picture, pure ""fabricated history"" ala Walt Disney television movies from the early 60s. This is a good movie for families with young children who wish to create revisionist history for their kids to protect them from the harsh realities of the Black experience in the American Rural South of the early 1950s. Overall the acting is good, the characters are well cast, but it's obvious they were encouraged with their slow delivery of lines to the point where it almost seems Gary Clark Jr. is actually trying to remember his next line. During the opening credits it says written, directed and edited by John Sayles...it would have been better if someone else had edited the film and would have been better still if someone else had directed it.",1232755200,2,1306,4.609442060085837

3389370,5,B0016AKSQY,"Having lived in the south for many years, ""Honeydripper"" was a nostalgic trip for us. Thought the acting excellent for the most part. Certainly the setting rang true. There is a long wait for the music, but the reward is worth it.",1217980800,6,230,4.5
3389371,5,B0016AKSQY,"John Sayles is a true independant filmmaker who not only finances, directs, edits and writes his movies but often times acts in and writes music for them. For ""Honeydripper"" Sayles did it all, and he wrote a couple of songs. He has dealt with the African American experience in movies before like: ""Brother From Another Planet"", ""Passion Fish"" and ""City of Hope"", but since most of the characters in ""Honeydripper"" are black he delves even deeper into the issue and the film is written more like a play with echoes of the work of August Wilson.
It's 1950 in the deep South and Danny Glover's Tyrone is barely making it and his Honeydripper lounge featuring aging blues players can't compete with the popular Jukejoint next door. To make matters worse the Honeydripper is about to close down unless Tyrone can come up with some serious money.
Most of the story revolves around the conflicts and relationships Tyrone has with his wife ( a powerful performance by Lisa Gay Hamilton), his partner (an excellent Charles Dutton), his daughter (a nice debut by model Ya Ya DeCosta), a young musician stranger (effectively played by young bluesman Gary Clark Jr.) and the white sheriff (a tailor made role for Stacey Keach). My favorite character is played by veteran bluesman Keb' Mo', a sort of bluesy greek chorus muse who appears at pivotal times only to Glover and Clark.
Sayles always takes his time developing his characters and the world in which they live, and though it may seem slow at first this lets you begin to care about what will happen to them. A big plus is the terrific music, and except for Glover, it is all played by the actors themselves and surprisingly it was all done live while filming.
Yes the movie, like a play, takes it's time to develop, but the payoff was one of the most uplifting times I've had at the movies in a long while.
I read that Sayles has decided to stop making movies and just write. I'm sure it must be getting harder to get these kinds of movies made and harder still to get them released, unfortunately no one makes movies like John Sayles.",1215820800,36,2082,4.629729729729729
3389372,5,B0016AKSQY,"John Sayles, perhaps more than any other American filmmaker, has his finger on the pulse of what make this country special.  A gifted storyteller, not one of his films is alike, but hes's at his best when he takes a small moment in time and uses it to explore a major change.  EIGHT MEN OUT uses the Black Sox scandal to reflect the loss of innocence of our nation.  LONE STAR uses a murder mystery to unearth skeletons long hidden, etc.  With HONEYDRIPPER, Sayles latest, he explores the moment Blues Became Electric, opening the door for Rock & Roll, the dominant music of the last half of the 20th Century.  He does so in the style of the late August Wilson, using quiet rhythms and essentially one locale to tell the story.  In the process, he gets allows his stellar cast to deliver some great performances, including Danny Glover, Charles S. Dutton, Keb Mo, Vondie Curtis-Hall and newcomer YaYa Dacosta, as China Doll.  Gary Clark, Jr. is a little stiff in his acting debut, but once he picks up the guitar, he puts a smile on your face.  Parts of the story may move a little slow, but Honeydripper's built for comfort, not for speed.  Once you know the plot, you'll begin to pick out minor details in the fabric of the film that absolutely glow.  Mind you, this is a film that could never be made within the Hollywood studio system, so if you're looking for Rush Hour 3, then move along.  But if you like a good story told well or just love the Blues, Honeydripper deserves a spot on your personal video shelf.",1214870400,18,1517,4.4601449275362315

The story line and the dialog left a lot to be desired, but the actors made up for that by delivering strong performances.  Danny Glover and Charles Dutton were believable in their roles and sold their characters.  If you like blues and early Rock n Roll, this is the movie for you.  By the end of the movie I got into the rhythm with the movie and enjoyed the time I spent watching it.",1485388800,,494,4.051546391752577

3389431,5,B0016AKSQY,"I didn't expect to enjoy this movie half as much as I did.  It was really excellent and I am not one to heap unwarranted praise on anything.  I have a strong disapproval of Danny Glover due to his politics, but I must admit he is an excellent actor and he manages to keep his politics out of the movies I've seen him in.  This story is about the owner of a black-owned bar called the ""Honeydripper.""  Since the owner is under financial duress and is about to be foreclosed on, he needed a big event that would bring in a large chunk of money over the weekend so that he could pay off his loan by Monday.  So he advertises beginning the week before that he will have the celebrity ""Sam the Guitar Man"" as entertainment over the weekend.  It turns out that ""Sam"" is indisposed and fails to turn up, so the bar owner grabs a drifter with a homemade guitar to stand in and pretend to be ""Sam.""  As it turned out, the drifter was a big fan of Sam's and knew all of his music very well, and he turned out to be an excellent guitar player.  When the people heard him play, several other townsfolk joined in and formed a band around the pseudo-Sam.  They had piano, saxophone, drums, accompanying the drifter.  The folks enjoyed the music and so did I.  In the end, the loan shark let the cat out of the bag that the drifter wasn't Sam, but by then the locals no longer cared, they liked this guy and his music.  In the end, the bar owner was able to pay off his debt on time.",1485216000,6,1468,4.130281690140845

3389438,5,B0016AKSQY,"Honeydripper was a little gem in the John Sayles catalog of film making. He has a unique style of story telling and his characters are always complex and nuanced. Danny Glover as Tyrone, trying to make a go of his little club against all odds has you rooting for him with all his human flaws. The performances from Charles Dutton,Lisa Gay Hamilton, Stacy Keach, Yaya Charles, Gary Clark and a slew of supporting cast bring to life the dilemmas of the black man's struggles in the Deep South of the 50's. The music is a vital part of bringing this story to life as well. Keb Mo almost steals the show as Possum. Very enjoyable and the music was a blast. Well worth watching.",1484870400,,673,4.435483870967742

Banksters and gangsters loaning money.  24 hours left to pay the debts when an unknown, hotshot guitar playing singer is drug out of the cotton fields and to the stage at the last minute to save the day and win the girl.

This movie seems to have been written for the stage.  There's only few sets in which most of the action takes place and most of the action is dialogue between 2-3 characters.  Unfortunately, in the end it was just too hard for me to continue to listen to Danny Glover's raspy, whispery delivery.  My hearing's not too good these days so most of the time I never understood what he was saying.

However, having said all that, Guy Clark Jr., the unknown, cotton pickin guitarist, makes the movie worth watching.  It was worth the price to hear him play.",1441584000,4,836,4.483443708609271

Tyrone, or Pine Top as he's known, plies his trade at the Honeydripper Lounge.  PineTop owes just about everybody including the landlord.

Purvis claims to have hired a big name guitar player in order to lure more customers in.  Nothing is that simple.  Plans go off their mark and Tyrone has to improvise.  Charles S. Dutton and Stacey Keach also star.

I watched it from a Netflix rental after seeing about 6 minutes of it on a recording following a movies that I taped on television. I wished that I had set the tape time to continue but I saw enough to know that I wanted to see more and so I rented it. The movie covered many areas of life in its depiction of the down home south backwoods of the south. The wooden juke house, lazy dialogue, injustice, death, laughter, music, flashbacks, hominess, church and everything country was a delight. I grew up in the dirt of the country in the Delta of Mississippi and the word ""Delta"" is mentioned in the movie. I never experienced all the things like in the movie, except I know what a field of cotton feels like and looks like (I was there once or twice) and I know how hot the sun is in those fields.

3389652,2,B0016AKSQY,"I was looking very forward to this movie, the cover made me think it would be about a guy playing cigar box guitar, but no, its some sort of modern looking pseudo-hobbled-together guitar.  It uses modern cigar box pickups with an Epiphone or Gibson neck.  Check out wikipedia to get an idea of what was happening in guitars in 30's to 50's.

Aside from that, the first half hour is full of cliches - did the writer actually do any research on Alabama in the 1950's?  Not even a trace of accent, a mixture of 30's and 70's clothing, the actors use phrasings which are contemporary.  I laughed for the first 45 mins or so.

The whole thing rolls out like a 50's version of ""Booty Time"", except Booty time was a lot funnier.  Should I say, somebody's fantasy of the 50's?

The entire plot ""situation"" is painfully foreshadowed, we know from the first 15 minutes how this is going to end.

The whitey sheriff who likes Glover's wife's cooking (apparently she invents KFC), reminds you of ""Smokey and The Bandit"", which may have served as research material.

What movie about blacks would be complete without a rich white women donating an un-useable dress to her maid: I was surprised it wasn't torn, but it was too small...

There were a few genuine moments, but this movie is a bit too Disney - a fantasy world somebody cooked up.  Some of the scenes have a surreal look and the featuring of a few big name performers was nice.",1300060800,,1425,4.48062015503876

Wrong. The story is transparent, the characters are fairly empty, the whole thing just dragged on and on...

3389657,5,B0016AKSQY,"I love movies that provide insight in how 20th-century American music developed in the transitional period between the heyday of blues and the coming of rock and roll! It's fascinating to see, looking back, how people were dumbfounded at the idea of an electric guitar (""How does it make a sound? There's no soundhole!"") The 50's and 60's were definitely the most exciting decades for being a musician--new ideas, musical styles and technology were developing at rapid speeds all over the place. What this movie does is provide an insight in how these kind of changes impacted a smalltown community in the south in 1950. The famous Guitar Sam (a character very obviously inspired by real blues artist Guitar Slim) backs out on a gig at the Honeydripper. No problem, some local upstart kid with an electric guitar can fill in for him--as Guitar Sam! The people in the community are so technologically deprived that they don't even know what Guitar Sam looks like, even though they eagerly flock to the club to see him perform!

Danny Glover does a great job in portraying the down-on-his-luck club owner, who needs to free himself of debt and his own demons stemming from an incident in his past. Keb Mo also does a great job in playing the guitar-playing character who embodies these demons.

Great music from Keb Mo and the other artists who supply the music. The piano playing during the end credits is some of the best blues piano playing you will ever hear! Fantastic! Great movie! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1256428800,7,1505,4.806949806949807
3389658,4,B0016AKSQY,"In the recent past in this space I have gone on and on about the old country blues performed after a hard, hard week's work on a Saturday in the local `juke joints' down in the southern United States in places like rural Mississippi and Alabama before World War II. Of course, then the music took the road north, especially after the war and got electrified to fit the needs of the new black migration that was heading up river to find work (and get the hell away from Jim Crow) in the newly unionized (in most cases) industrial plants. But what about those left behind, or those who did not or could not go north? Or just wanted to, or had to, keep away from the cities with their treacherous ways? Answering those questions, in a nutshell, forms the plotline to this entertaining little saga about the trials and tribulations of modernization, blues version.

Okay, here is the plot line. A struggling juke joint owner, Pine Top Purvis (also the house piano player), played by star Danny Glover, is financially in deep trouble and needs a quick fix to keep the wolves from the door. Nothing seems to be working for the man, especially when a regionally well-known early R&B hot shot who is suppose to resolve all Danny's financial problems is a no show. Not to worry, an itinerant R&B wannabe just happens to ride the blinds into town, gets himself into trouble (mainly for being black while seeking a work-some things never change), and in the end is Danny's salvation by performing a successful  Saturday gig  and saving the day.

Along the way we also get small glimpse of black rural life including, naturally, the ardors of plantation life, -that means cotton picking, the tough times of small time musical talents, the role of the religious tent revival in rural life and needless to say, the confinements, large and small, of Jim Crow, physically, mentally and spiritually. I have reviewed plenty of film documentaries in this space that touch on the blues and the social milieu that it derived from. While those vehicles still give a historically more accurate account of what went into create that special blues idiom just before it got electrified this film is not a bad take on what that was all about- a little prettified up to be sure.",1249344000,,2250,4.659949622166247

 It is regrettable if one intellectualizes the humanity  to diminish the emotional impact.",1517616000,,328,4.909090909090909
