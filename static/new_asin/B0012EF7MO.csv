The Dutchman and Daland are saling on actual ships through actual water; there's as much emphasis on acting as singing, and there are some truly thrilling dramatic orchestral moments.

3087021,3,B0012EF7MO,"First: 8(sic) EIGHT CUTS IN THE SCORE!

1)The steersman song's 1st strophe - consequence: the delicate balance of a strict strophe (1st) and the 2nd ""corrupted"" strophe (by insertions of one the ""tempest"" motives) is broken!

2)The usual (but not more tolerable for that) in the final part of the last Daland/Dutchman duet.

3)The also usual (and also intolerable!) on the 2nd of the 3 spinning song's strophes.

4)The 1st of Erik's aria 2 strophes (revolting!)

5)At the Dutchman/Daland/Senta trio ""stretta"".

6)At the 1st phrase Dutchman's Crew song!

7)The most stupefying one: the 2(sic), two bars that separate Erik's aria and the Dutchman's entrance (""Verloren, ach verloren"" etc.)[note-this is actually a Wagner option for the very 1st version (http://www.amazon.com/Wagner-fliegende-Hollnder-Paris-version/dp/B0006PV5SA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1220440752&sr=8-3) which has NO PLACE HERE!].

(Please Amazon! The Weil recording isn't the """"""Paris Version"""""" at all!!)

8) And the also also usual (and also...intolerable) right in the middle of Senta/Erik/Dutchman trio.

If one doubt that things really grow old, this movie gives ample evidence of the contrary; gritted teeth for despair, half-open mouth for sadness, confusion, despair. The major reason for this editing is that, back in 1975, opera people thought that Wagner operas form his first compositional period should be ""corrected"" (a kind of  ""wielandities"")...this is a complete nonsense, because Wagner knew  exactly how and what music he wanted to write in this period (the changes from the very first version [link above], the 1843 one and its """"Tristan-like-ending"""" later version show preciselly the necessary alterations).

The press-release claims that this is the 2nd(1843) version, but it isn't, because the descending instrumental line just before the Dutchman's phrase (""...Erfahre das Geschick..."") is played only by the strings, not by the brass section...on the other hand, senta sings the ballade  a whole tone higher (A minor), a choice in the 2nd version, and the soprano's line just before the ballade, when she addresses the chorus, is also from the 1843 version.

This, Sawallisch 2nd recording is a ""via-media"" between his savage Bayreuth version and his late, sleepy one (on Laserdisc, no longer available). The conductor's unique use of rubato in Wagner, his intelligent view that this is a work from the beginning/middle of the 19th century (the conversational passages are really classical im articulation and tempi), his structural  and textural clarity are the main assets here; the sound picture is warm (a little agressive sometimes, probably due to the limitations of the DVD medium, as far as the sound is concerned), with a acceptable ""holographic"" image, that just recedes at the loudest moments (the clash between the nowegians and the ghost crew). Transitions are expertly done, although the above-mentioned sleepyness raises its head already at some points. The  conductoris at his weakest by the final trio and the Dutchman statement, when things are rushed and McIntyre, consequently, sounds a little puny.
This singer was at his height by then, with a true homogeneity of timbre, easyness in the whole tessitura, and a real understanding of the character's more fragile side (his ""...weit komm'ich her, verwehrt bei Sturm und Wetter..."" sounds almost with no vibrato, like a child), not flinching at any  part of his monologue's, no matter how difficult it may be. His combination of text and articulation is also a paragon for the role, although he has some problems with ""Umlaut"" vowels.

Ligendza is second only to Varnay in the soprano part, for she not only sings it at its original pitch (as mentioned above), but hits all the notes dead-center, specially at the high B's (""...treu dir, bis zum Tod!""). His acting is a little stiff, but she isn't alone...

Winkler and Rundgren are what they are: top 2nd clas singers, Ek is a wide-eyed Steersman, chorus and Orch on ""B"" form.

How old the movie is? Well, suffice to day that the scene between the dutch and norwegian crew are a good teaser of what might be the ""Night of the living dead; the musical"", and the actual Senta's jump was like the one who is going very carefully inside a very cold bath, and, since this s ""original"" Staged performance, why the Dutchman and Senta sink into a seemingly bubbling hot sea?

McIntyre is very good as the doomed captain and Ligendza with her cold beauty is a marvelous Senta. The acting is of a very high quality and visually the production is certainly inspired. I find this as a great alternative to Kupfer's Bayreuth production which was also very imaginative and powerful.
But actually I am very happy to possess a strongly faithful adaptation of this magnificent opera, made by a director who certainly knows how to build the harmony between visuals and the music.
The audio recording is also first rate. Sawallisch is a great wagner conductor as usual, Ligendza with her huge voice delivers thrilling results especially in the famous ballad. McIntyre is an intelligent singer who manages to perform Hollander's menacing and terrifying aspects but also his melancholy and tragic fate. The orchestra is not bayreuth but still provides grandiose moments under Sawallisch's command. The chorus and the rest of the cast are also excellent.
Dts sound is brilliant providing a very organic sound experience. English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese subtitles are also included. Highly recommended.",1211500800,22,1247,5.303030303030303
3087023,5,B0012EF7MO,"You can taste the salt spray and feel the waves heave beneath your feet. You can almost see Captain Jack Sparrow mincing saucily on the fo'c'sle deck. This brilliantly evocative 1975 film of Wagner's tale of the Flying Dutchman, replete with mighty square-rigged ships, storm-tossed waves, pea soup fog, ghosts of dead sailors who are reanimated and the grisly green corpses of dead sailors who are not, breathes life into Wagner's early score, making for a splendidly atmospheric musical experience. Filmed in the studio, with the singers lip-synching the score, it is blessed with wonderful period sets and costumes, its 19th Century hyperreality heightened by mighty ocean waves and their tempest-swept ships, an effect filmed in two huge water tanks. Der Fliegende Hollander lightens our burdens aboard ship as if it were a two hour long sea shanty. Wagner lends himself to full-scale film presentation (as opposed to filmed stagings). His Ring Cycle seems to be especially ideal for some future CGI film extravaganza.

Directed with visionary zeal by the Czech opera director Vaclav Kaslik, a veteran of 150 opera productions in the theatre, usually working with the great Czech scenographer Josef Svoboda, he exhuberantly tackles any of Wagner's stage directions or text that call for a special effect. Distinctive examples of visual intensity are the phantom ship with its red sails approaching the shore at speed and anchoring and the ghost crew arising from the dead in response to the taunts of the Norwegian sailors at the end of Act III. The conductor of the splendid Bayerisches Staatsorchester and Chor is Wolfgang Sawallisch, a Hollander specialist since his first performances of the work in Augsburg in the 1940s. He utilizes as his musical text Wagner's earlier thoughts on the score as it was originally performed for its premiere in Dresden, which Sawallisch has come to prefer over the years as being more effective. This version includes the so-called 'blunt' ending to the Overture and the performance of Act III without the harp-dominated Tristan-influenced redemption music, as well as louder and wilder brass commentaries throughout the entire opera. It makes for a much more visceral experience, a gutsier opera that seems to scrape against the nerves as one listens, causing one to sit-up and take notice as the supernatural tale unfolds.

Donald McIntyre is a charismatic Hollander, dressed in black leather and tall boots. He sings the part well. Senta is played by Catarina Ligendza, who appears troubled and confused, not quite grasping the attraction she feels for this strange man. Her voice is good, although it wobbles ocassionally. Daland is the very fine Bengt Rundgren. Erik is Hermann Winkler. The cast is quite good, which is especially important because so much of this film depends upon their acting as well as their vocal work. The superb orchestra is always right there to comment on the action, bringing dramatic unity to the performance. The result is an effective whole that is often quite riveting in its totality.

The digitally remastered film is crystal clear, as is the sound in PCM stereo and DTS 5.1. The disc lasts 117 minutes and is coded 0 worldwide. The usual DGG menus, catalogs and translations are here, along with a booklet.

This beautifully filmed, visually evocative performance is an especially atmospheric Fliegende Hollander. Strongly recommended.

3087044,5,B0012EF7MO,"Donald McIntyre is one of the greats, and it's really fun to watch him acting his heart out underwater in the opening sequence. The later acts, inside, are less fabulous, with rather stiff acting from Senta, but it's totally worth it for the brillliant beginning.",1392940800,,263,4.866666666666666
3087045,5,B0012EF7MO,"I really did not expect this video ""movie"" style opera to be as good as it is. The singing is very good and the acting is excellent. The weakest character, in my opinion, is Senta. She seems neither crazed nor obsessed. She appears a bit confused, perhaps emotionally stunted. In other versions of this opera I've seen ranges of totally whacked out Sentas to rather ethereal characters. This one just seems flat to me.

The scenes are great and make me wish opera and technology would collaborate on more productions like this. First, it's not untrue to the opera. They haven't produced a Disney version here. I like that. The movie aspect merely allows the producer to do things impossible on stage such as the use of actual water for storms. If movies can be made and remain true to the opera, it is a great marriage of art and technology.

This work is almost 40 years old! Why haven't more movie operas been produced? A Ring Cycle, true to the opera would have huge potential though I suppose the market might be limited.

In all, this is well done and very interesting. Both the spinning and helmsman songs are hard to get out of your head after watching!

One note---when the hunter drops the deer, did anyone note that it twitches? Geesh, did they actually shoot a deer for that scene? Yes, it's THAT realistic.

I recommend this video highly.",1380240000,2,1350,4.5850622406639
3087046,5,B0012EF7MO,"I think my title says it all.

The disc contains not the usual effort to translate a staged production to the broadcast medium. Instead, this production was intended for the screen: the big screen and then down to the littlier ones we have in our homes. It is a film with all the advantages of film and sound productions. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1378684800,,343,4.622950819672131
3087047,5,B0012EF7MO,"This is undoubtedly the best version of the opera to SEE. I have other versions I prefer to hear. But visually this is a great video and captures the essence of Wagner's work. If you want to SEE the Flying Dutchman this is the only version to get. If you want to HEAR a great version of this opera then get the Met Opera version with James Morris in the title role. Maybe I am partial to that version as I saw it live and James Morris is my all time favorite Wagnerian bass-Baritone. But I am reviewing this video.

I like this video for the atmospheric presentation which brings the opera alive the way a stage presentation cannot.

What I didn't like was the 1834 version of the opera which basically omits, among other things, the transcendant ending and the glorious redemption music as the souls of Senta and the Dutchman ascend from a dark, and stormy sea into a golden glow of eternity. The Dutchman was one of the first operas I ever saw and it was at the ""old"" Met. I still remember that glorious remdemption music and the golden sky with the sun rising out of the sea. So I really wanted that ending in this movie. I think the 1934 version has become more popular these days.

I am still giving this 5 stars as I think it is a great visual realization of an opera which is really hard to stage even with all the modern tools of stages today. Because of the staging demands, it lends itself to a film.

The singers are very good, but not great. I am not partial to Donald McIntyre in Wagnerian roles, although many like him. His voice is much lighter than I like. I prefer Morris or Franz Grundheber in the role. The best Senta on CD is still Leonie Rysanek, actually one of the best Senta's ever.

But although this does not represent my ideal cast or conductor, they are still very good and the visuals alone make it a great introduction to the opera and worth 5 stars. Too many operas on CD are Eurotrash, updated stagings which cater to the ego of the director rather than the vision of the composer.",1344038400,3,2013,4.314814814814815
3087048,1,B0012EF7MO,"This is not a typical opera performed on stage, but a ""movie"" where actors pretend singing on a lot more realistic settings, with real water, miniature ship, and so on.

In the beginning, I thought it was a good idea.... but as soon as singing started, oh man....

The singers hardly move their lips! So fake! and the songs are cut to make this DVD to fit in a single disc!

I cannot believe anyone recommends this production!!!",1328054400,11,428,4.461538461538462
3087049,1,B0012EF7MO,"I impose two criteria before I'll even look at a Hollaender DVD :  (1) It must be the revised version with the Redemption motif at the end of the overture and the opera itself; (2) it must not be Regietheater, i.e. it must be a ""traditional"", i.e. authentic as opposed to fraudulent, performance.  This recording  fails Test 1, thereby obviating the need for further critique.  As if Wagner had nothing better to do that day than revise his beloved early operas with his  magnificent new techniques!  (He did the same with Tannhaeuser'; if you want to get that one be careful it's the 'Paris' version and not the original 'Dresden' version.  I recommend the Met recording.)

As for Hollaender, I recommend the one performed within the walls of a Finnish castle, with Behrens as Senta.  I just watched this one yesterday, expecting little good judging from the reviews, but was most pleasantly surprised.  It's a world-class performance in every respect, easily the equal of the best Bayreuth can crank out, and the few 'gimmicks' are tasteful and, with very few exceptions, not distracting.  Disregard the negatives you read on this board - it's a great performance and - most important - a labor of love, obviously.  That's important with Wagner - this composer cannot be performed successfully by people who don't appreciate the greatness of his creations.",1278720000,6,1358,4.933920704845815
3087050,1,B0012EF7MO,"This ""filmed"" version is actually a studio-bound performance shot on videotape. The production team used a Broadway aesthetic that I found glib, cliched, cynical and unimaginative. For instance, during the spinning wheel number, the camera pans 360 degrees to show the women in a circle. Cute, but it's an empty gesture which only serves to make Senta appear unsympathetic (the the director ""clever"", I suppose).
The actors play to the back rows, eschewing the subtleties that can be caught on camera.
I didn't find the singing to be strong, either.
And the producers chose not to use Wagner's revised version, so the redemption motif is missing from the overture and the end.

For Wagner on film, I would highly recommend a wonderful, traditional Meistersinger (Hamburg Opera 1970), or a real masterwork, Syberberg's Parsifal (1982).

3087053,5,B0012EF7MO,"This is a wonderful DVD, one which has already been reviewed (and superbly so) by Mike Birman.  This review is of another performance of ""The Flying Dutchman"", one which I remembered and thought about this morning while walking to work in lower Manhattan.

New York City Opera's fall season in 2001 was scheduled to open with a new production of  ""The Flying Dutchman"", a rare excursion into Wagnerian repertory for that company.  The premiere (as well as the entire opening week) was cancelled, due, of course, to the horrifying events of September 11th; that cancelled performance was rescheduled in late October as a 9/11 benefit.  The opening ceremony that evening was very moving, with the entire cast (in full makeup) and backstage crew gathered on stage, underneath a large American flag which hung overhead.  After a speech or two, it was announced that the flag hanging above the stage had covered the coffin of a member of the opera company's crew, who died on 9/11 while performing his duties as a member of the New York City Fire Department.  The deceased firefighter's son, who also worked backstage at City Opera, was present onstage.  Needless to say, there was not a dry eye in the house.

And then the opera began.  For those not familiar with the ""legend"" of the Flying Dutchman, here is the Cliff Notes version:  centuries ago, the Dutchman, a sea captain, while rounding southern Africa during a great storm, cried out that his ship would continue sailing, Satan be damned.  Well, Satan heard him, and punished the Dutchman, his ship and crew, consigning them all to sail the seven seas for eternity, with no hope for salvation.  In Wagner's version, an angel of mercy intervenes and tempers the sentence somewhat, giving the Dutchman a chance at salvation and redemption:  every seven years, the Dutchman is permitted to bring his ship ashore.  During his time on land, if the Dutchman can find a woman who will be faithful to him until death, his soul will be saved.  Along comes Senta, who has been obsessed with the legend of the Flying Dutchman all her life; she meets and falls in love with him when he mysteriously appears, forgetting, for the moment, she is already engaged to someone else.  The Dutchman becomes enraged upon learning of Senta's previous engagement, and sails off, disconsolate, for another seven years of torment.  Senta, watching the ship sail away from a nearby clifftop, cries out to the Dutchman that she will remain faithful to him for all eternity, and leaps to her death into the sea.  The Dutchman's ship sinks in the distance, and the curse has been broken:  the Dutchman, due to Senta's devotion, sacrifice and selflessness, has finally found salvation.

While this very well mounted performance of an opera I have long loved played out before me, I began to think about how appropriate Wagner's redemptive storyline was for the occasion at hand:  we were assembled that evening to honor and pay tribute to 400+ men and women, heroes all, who selflessly climbed the stairs of the Twin Towers that terrible day, all in an effort to protect and save their fellow New Yorkers.  Before dying in the line of duty, these brave members of New York City's Fire Department and Police Department helped save the lives of thousands of New Yorkers on the morning of 9/11.  It's very hard to believe that seven years have passed.

New Yorkers will never forget their Bravest and Finest, who selflessly gave their all to help us on 9/11/01, many of them paying the ultimate price in doing so.  This is written in tribute to them.

May God bless them all -- they will never be forgotten.",1221091200,11,3628,4.790996784565916

Dts sound is brilliant providing a very organic sound experience. English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese subtitles are also included. Highly recommended.",1211500800,22,1247,5.303030303030303
3321520,5,B0012EF7MO,"You can taste the salt spray and feel the waves heave beneath your feet. You can almost see Captain Jack Sparrow mincing saucily on the fo'c'sle deck. This brilliantly evocative 1975 film of Wagner's tale of the Flying Dutchman, replete with mighty square-rigged ships, storm-tossed waves, pea soup fog, ghosts of dead sailors who are reanimated and the grisly green corpses of dead sailors who are not, breathes life into Wagner's early score, making for a splendidly atmospheric musical experience. Filmed in the studio, with the singers lip-synching the score, it is blessed with wonderful period sets and costumes, its 19th Century hyperreality heightened by mighty ocean waves and their tempest-swept ships, an effect filmed in two huge water tanks. Der Fliegende Hollander lightens our burdens aboard ship as if it were a two hour long sea shanty. Wagner lends himself to full-scale film presentation (as opposed to filmed stagings). His Ring Cycle seems to be especially ideal for some future CGI film extravaganza.

Directed with visionary zeal by the Czech opera director Vaclav Kaslik, a veteran of 150 opera productions in the theatre, usually working with the great Czech scenographer Josef Svoboda, he exhuberantly tackles any of Wagner's stage directions or text that call for a special effect. Distinctive examples of visual intensity are the phantom ship with its red sails approaching the shore at speed and anchoring and the ghost crew arising from the dead in response to the taunts of the Norwegian sailors at the end of Act III. The conductor of the splendid Bayerisches Staatsorchester and Chor is Wolfgang Sawallisch, a Hollander specialist since his first performances of the work in Augsburg in the 1940s. He utilizes as his musical text Wagner's earlier thoughts on the score as it was originally performed for its premiere in Dresden, which Sawallisch has come to prefer over the years as being more effective. This version includes the so-called 'blunt' ending to the Overture and the performance of Act III without the harp-dominated Tristan-influenced redemption music, as well as louder and wilder brass commentaries throughout the entire opera. It makes for a much more visceral experience, a gutsier opera that seems to scrape against the nerves as one listens, causing one to sit-up and take notice as the supernatural tale unfolds.

Donald McIntyre is a charismatic Hollander, dressed in black leather and tall boots. He sings the part well. Senta is played by Catarina Ligendza, who appears troubled and confused, not quite grasping the attraction she feels for this strange man. Her voice is good, although it wobbles ocassionally. Daland is the very fine Bengt Rundgren. Erik is Hermann Winkler. The cast is quite good, which is especially important because so much of this film depends upon their acting as well as their vocal work. The superb orchestra is always right there to comment on the action, bringing dramatic unity to the performance. The result is an effective whole that is often quite riveting in its totality.

The digitally remastered film is crystal clear, as is the sound in PCM stereo and DTS 5.1. The disc lasts 117 minutes and is coded 0 worldwide. The usual DGG menus, catalogs and translations are here, along with a booklet.

This beautifully filmed, visually evocative performance is an especially atmospheric Fliegende Hollander. Strongly recommended.

3321541,5,B0012EF7MO,"Donald McIntyre is one of the greats, and it's really fun to watch him acting his heart out underwater in the opening sequence. The later acts, inside, are less fabulous, with rather stiff acting from Senta, but it's totally worth it for the brillliant beginning.",1392940800,,263,4.866666666666666
3321542,5,B0012EF7MO,"I really did not expect this video ""movie"" style opera to be as good as it is. The singing is very good and the acting is excellent. The weakest character, in my opinion, is Senta. She seems neither crazed nor obsessed. She appears a bit confused, perhaps emotionally stunted. In other versions of this opera I've seen ranges of totally whacked out Sentas to rather ethereal characters. This one just seems flat to me.

The scenes are great and make me wish opera and technology would collaborate on more productions like this. First, it's not untrue to the opera. They haven't produced a Disney version here. I like that. The movie aspect merely allows the producer to do things impossible on stage such as the use of actual water for storms. If movies can be made and remain true to the opera, it is a great marriage of art and technology.

This work is almost 40 years old! Why haven't more movie operas been produced? A Ring Cycle, true to the opera would have huge potential though I suppose the market might be limited.

In all, this is well done and very interesting. Both the spinning and helmsman songs are hard to get out of your head after watching!

One note---when the hunter drops the deer, did anyone note that it twitches? Geesh, did they actually shoot a deer for that scene? Yes, it's THAT realistic.

I recommend this video highly.",1380240000,2,1350,4.5850622406639
3321543,5,B0012EF7MO,"I think my title says it all.

The disc contains not the usual effort to translate a staged production to the broadcast medium. Instead, this production was intended for the screen: the big screen and then down to the littlier ones we have in our homes. It is a film with all the advantages of film and sound productions. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1378684800,,343,4.622950819672131
3321544,5,B0012EF7MO,"This is undoubtedly the best version of the opera to SEE. I have other versions I prefer to hear. But visually this is a great video and captures the essence of Wagner's work. If you want to SEE the Flying Dutchman this is the only version to get. If you want to HEAR a great version of this opera then get the Met Opera version with James Morris in the title role. Maybe I am partial to that version as I saw it live and James Morris is my all time favorite Wagnerian bass-Baritone. But I am reviewing this video.

I like this video for the atmospheric presentation which brings the opera alive the way a stage presentation cannot.

What I didn't like was the 1834 version of the opera which basically omits, among other things, the transcendant ending and the glorious redemption music as the souls of Senta and the Dutchman ascend from a dark, and stormy sea into a golden glow of eternity. The Dutchman was one of the first operas I ever saw and it was at the ""old"" Met. I still remember that glorious remdemption music and the golden sky with the sun rising out of the sea. So I really wanted that ending in this movie. I think the 1934 version has become more popular these days.

I am still giving this 5 stars as I think it is a great visual realization of an opera which is really hard to stage even with all the modern tools of stages today. Because of the staging demands, it lends itself to a film.

The singers are very good, but not great. I am not partial to Donald McIntyre in Wagnerian roles, although many like him. His voice is much lighter than I like. I prefer Morris or Franz Grundheber in the role. The best Senta on CD is still Leonie Rysanek, actually one of the best Senta's ever.

But although this does not represent my ideal cast or conductor, they are still very good and the visuals alone make it a great introduction to the opera and worth 5 stars. Too many operas on CD are Eurotrash, updated stagings which cater to the ego of the director rather than the vision of the composer.",1344038400,3,2013,4.314814814814815

In the beginning, I thought it was a good idea.... but as soon as singing started, oh man....

The singers hardly move their lips! So fake! and the songs are cut to make this DVD to fit in a single disc!

3321546,1,B0012EF7MO,"I impose two criteria before I'll even look at a Hollaender DVD :  (1) It must be the revised version with the Redemption motif at the end of the overture and the opera itself; (2) it must not be Regietheater, i.e. it must be a ""traditional"", i.e. authentic as opposed to fraudulent, performance.  This recording  fails Test 1, thereby obviating the need for further critique.  As if Wagner had nothing better to do that day than revise his beloved early operas with his  magnificent new techniques!  (He did the same with Tannhaeuser'; if you want to get that one be careful it's the 'Paris' version and not the original 'Dresden' version.  I recommend the Met recording.)

As for Hollaender, I recommend the one performed within the walls of a Finnish castle, with Behrens as Senta.  I just watched this one yesterday, expecting little good judging from the reviews, but was most pleasantly surprised.  It's a world-class performance in every respect, easily the equal of the best Bayreuth can crank out, and the few 'gimmicks' are tasteful and, with very few exceptions, not distracting.  Disregard the negatives you read on this board - it's a great performance and - most important - a labor of love, obviously.  That's important with Wagner - this composer cannot be performed successfully by people who don't appreciate the greatness of his creations.",1278720000,6,1358,4.933920704845815
3321547,1,B0012EF7MO,"This ""filmed"" version is actually a studio-bound performance shot on videotape. The production team used a Broadway aesthetic that I found glib, cliched, cynical and unimaginative. For instance, during the spinning wheel number, the camera pans 360 degrees to show the women in a circle. Cute, but it's an empty gesture which only serves to make Senta appear unsympathetic (the the director ""clever"", I suppose).
The actors play to the back rows, eschewing the subtleties that can be caught on camera.
I didn't find the singing to be strong, either.
And the producers chose not to use Wagner's revised version, so the redemption motif is missing from the overture and the end.

For Wagner on film, I would highly recommend a wonderful, traditional Meistersinger (Hamburg Opera 1970), or a real masterwork, Syberberg's Parsifal (1982).

3321550,5,B0012EF7MO,"This is a wonderful DVD, one which has already been reviewed (and superbly so) by Mike Birman.  This review is of another performance of ""The Flying Dutchman"", one which I remembered and thought about this morning while walking to work in lower Manhattan.

New York City Opera's fall season in 2001 was scheduled to open with a new production of  ""The Flying Dutchman"", a rare excursion into Wagnerian repertory for that company.  The premiere (as well as the entire opening week) was cancelled, due, of course, to the horrifying events of September 11th; that cancelled performance was rescheduled in late October as a 9/11 benefit.  The opening ceremony that evening was very moving, with the entire cast (in full makeup) and backstage crew gathered on stage, underneath a large American flag which hung overhead.  After a speech or two, it was announced that the flag hanging above the stage had covered the coffin of a member of the opera company's crew, who died on 9/11 while performing his duties as a member of the New York City Fire Department.  The deceased firefighter's son, who also worked backstage at City Opera, was present onstage.  Needless to say, there was not a dry eye in the house.

And then the opera began.  For those not familiar with the ""legend"" of the Flying Dutchman, here is the Cliff Notes version:  centuries ago, the Dutchman, a sea captain, while rounding southern Africa during a great storm, cried out that his ship would continue sailing, Satan be damned.  Well, Satan heard him, and punished the Dutchman, his ship and crew, consigning them all to sail the seven seas for eternity, with no hope for salvation.  In Wagner's version, an angel of mercy intervenes and tempers the sentence somewhat, giving the Dutchman a chance at salvation and redemption:  every seven years, the Dutchman is permitted to bring his ship ashore.  During his time on land, if the Dutchman can find a woman who will be faithful to him until death, his soul will be saved.  Along comes Senta, who has been obsessed with the legend of the Flying Dutchman all her life; she meets and falls in love with him when he mysteriously appears, forgetting, for the moment, she is already engaged to someone else.  The Dutchman becomes enraged upon learning of Senta's previous engagement, and sails off, disconsolate, for another seven years of torment.  Senta, watching the ship sail away from a nearby clifftop, cries out to the Dutchman that she will remain faithful to him for all eternity, and leaps to her death into the sea.  The Dutchman's ship sinks in the distance, and the curse has been broken:  the Dutchman, due to Senta's devotion, sacrifice and selflessness, has finally found salvation.

While this very well mounted performance of an opera I have long loved played out before me, I began to think about how appropriate Wagner's redemptive storyline was for the occasion at hand:  we were assembled that evening to honor and pay tribute to 400+ men and women, heroes all, who selflessly climbed the stairs of the Twin Towers that terrible day, all in an effort to protect and save their fellow New Yorkers.  Before dying in the line of duty, these brave members of New York City's Fire Department and Police Department helped save the lives of thousands of New Yorkers on the morning of 9/11.  It's very hard to believe that seven years have passed.

New Yorkers will never forget their Bravest and Finest, who selflessly gave their all to help us on 9/11/01, many of them paying the ultimate price in doing so.  This is written in tribute to them.

May God bless them all -- they will never be forgotten.",1221091200,11,3628,4.790996784565916
8245456,3,B0012EF7MO,"I'm partial to the recording with George London, Leonie Rysanek, Antal Dorati conducting. This recording with Donald McIntyre is troublesome; in part due to the lack of affect in the performance of Catarina Ligendza as Senta. There was very little nuance in her delivery. The  Act 2: 'Johohoe! Traft Ihr Das Schiff Im Meere An' was totally lacking in desire. She was just adamant. I think much of the problem is in the stage direction. For example when the Dutchman enters and sees Senta for the first time, the two of them just stare at each other waaay too long. They are more transfixed (and ""staring"") rather than filled with emotion of what this meeting could produce. They are essentially, when it comes to acting they are delivering a (pardon my reference) ""one note"" performance. McIntyre's voice is strong and compelling, but I found Ligendza'z sound a bit harsh.

Of note, the performance staging is interesting with the Dutchman actually wading in waist-deep ocean water ostensibly checking the anchor. You could see his breath implying he was singing in a cold environment. I guess I would have expected this to cause a problem with delivery, but it didn't seem to. Herman Winkler is a pathetic figure as Eric, and there is absolutely no indication that he and Senta were on a marriage path. While Eric wines about his concern for 'his' future if she rejects him, she shows no conflict or affection for him. All she wants, apparently, is to save the Dutchman (who she has never met) from his fate by dying with him. Okay, I know it's opera and operas can instantaneously or impulsively include a change in plot, in character, in... (you name it). But how much more interesting if we see the conflict and emotions at war within her.",1506902400,,1743,4.749174917491749

8245461,5,B0012EF7MO,"Wagner's musical/dramatic sensibility was rooted in the concept of ""Gesamtunstwerk"" -- the idea that everything -- the words, the music, the production values -- everything should combine to create a seamless work.  This is similar to Aristotle's view that drama must be characterized by ""magnitude"" -- that unity of dramaturgy so integrated that everything contributes to the integrity of the whole.  That said, I have to say that Wagner would have loved the idea of filmed versions of his work -- if they're done right!  I like the filmed operas of Franco Zefferelli.  But after seeing this film version of Hollander, however, Zefferelli's Traviata and Otello seem garish.  In every moment of this movie the sight and sense echo one another.  I could write pages about the richness of detail.  How else but in film could one see the Dutchman deliver his monologue in the water, clutching an anchor?  The singing and acting and playing are superb, with no less than Wolfgang Sawallisch conducting?  Everything looks and sounds right.  Even the steersman looks like what one imagines when hearing his music.  I was shocked that some reviews were negative -- way too cerebral.  This is opera, folks, written when composers sought to touch the human heart and reach a wide audience, unlike today's music which is too often written by academics for academics.  What this film achieves is what Wagner wanted at Bayreuth -- a cohesion of what one sees and what one hears.  Yes, I'm a groundling -- a philistine who seeks goosebumps -- not fodder for dry intellectual discourse -- in opera.  I loved this movie!  Like the Met's recent representational Ring -- before all of those god-awful wooden panels they have now -- it represents the composer's vision awesomely.",1438819200,3,1761,4.97945205479452
