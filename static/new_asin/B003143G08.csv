4048042,5,B003143G08,"From start to finish you will loose yourself in the spectacular scenery and the music of this journey. Like ALL Rieu' productions, he brings the authenticity of the location/country through the costumes, songs and music, and the scenery that is edited into the DVD. His wicked sense of humor with his audience, which is prevalent in EVERY DVD HE HAS EVER MADE, is woven through the program and will draw you into the midst of the reverie. His ability to speak the main language of the country he is performing in is nothing short of genius. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EVERY DVD HE PRODUCES HAS SUBTITLES IN WHICH EVER LANGUAGE YOU PREFER.  Highly recommended.",1398211200,,654,4.6869565217391305

4048048,5,B003143G08,"I have been a fan of this great musician since he first appeared on the world's stage. This one joins many others by being set in places with which I am familiar. When I served with the U. S. Army, I spent a fair amount of time in Heidelberg; being a fan of Romberg's

4048049,5,B003143G08,"My husband and I adore Andre Rieu and his orchestra. We have never yet been disappointed in a performance, and ""I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg"" has happily been added to our collection of DVDs (about 17 now!).

If you want to enjoy delightful music (ranging from operetta to grand opera and classical), performed by wonderful singers and an orchestra filled with musicians who obviously enjoy every moment, lots of fun, and exuberantly appreciative audiences that sing along and dance in the aisles, Andre Rieu's performances are the best place to find them.

No matter how tired, ""down,"" or even sick feeling we may be, a good dose of Andre leaves us feeling joyful, peaceful and relaxed.",1374364800,,688,4.871794871794871

4048051,5,B003143G08,"One of the nicest concerts by Andre Rieu's Johaan Straus Orchestra. The cutaway videos around the town with Mirusia and Andre as well as her with the Bass players in the car were very lovelyand added to the whole video of the concert. Again the music was as always wonderful, I have several concerts now and enjoy them almost every day. The orchestra is a joy to watch and listen to I have never seen any orchestra have so much fun playing and especially seeing all the most beutiful young ladies dressed in their pretty dresses. A lot of talent in this orchestra.",1355270400,2,564,4.485436893203883

4048057,3,B003143G08,"I have been disappointed with only two of Andre Rieu DVD's and this one was second in line of the 'not pleased'. The pause inbetween songs was the longest of all the DVD's I have collected. It was lacking of his humor and comical spurts from both he and his musicians.
The one I was most displeased with was the DVD with clips from previous presentations copied and pasted onto one and to delete the introductions and humerous comments from Andre was a mistake.
Next one I purchase I will view the music presented.",1307145600,4,514,4.4787234042553195
