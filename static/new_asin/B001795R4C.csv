Even though it show cases that they really do sing, & dance,  I wish they would release this & other Fame kids items, such as all they're live performances on Dvd, right now.
How long have we waited, for someone to care to do so? It's a crule misjustice to only release some things, but not everything on to Dvd. The fans, & the Fame kids deserve better treatment, and concideration, for this beloved production, for real Multi tallents gone un- sung, but never forgoten.

The American MGM releases of seasons 1 and 2
Since America's Fame fan feels gyped, out of getting the entire series on Dvd. After years of waiting, & hoping, & less liked shows not of this caliber released in they're completions.

The true artist in all of us,(Fame being an insulting monicer, & misnomer.) Given that such a more real, and complex mix of ideas, & values. Not one dimenssional people put in front of the camera. We got to love & missed our Fame family & friends, but when the original writers, and staff got the axe, after 1 & 2, MGM cancelled Fame.

But American Fame fans left unaware, at the time, that the Cast continued on. & they're were 4 more seasons, we were never allowed to see, or be a part of. Because no matter how faithful our veiwership was
were just fans after all, & apparently to the Network we don't count, & our oppinions be dam'ned, we were never meant to find out the decietful actions taken, with our beloved Fame Family, or that MGM sent the last 4 seasons over to Europe?!

I only heard about this misjustice reciently, & feel appalled by the Net works interferance, in Censoring what we are allowed to watch, and what we are not, still to this day, cause they don't care to release the whole Fame catolog to Dvd, for some stupid reason. If you care about undoing this misjustice, & it does go against the Constitution by the way. Un American, like me bother MGM, who I hear are bank rupt by the way, & would only benefit by this real Complete release, & Fox too. A lot of people would. I, have already tried. But one voice, does not HELP!! The Fame family fandom out there, need to speak out, & not give up on those Coorperate unfeeling idiots. Let's make this a realization, & really get the tribulation, that our beloved Fame family deserves.
Cause they don't care, not even the prospect of making more, from the sales of such a profitable undertaking, & peaceful finallity, to such a wonderful show.

Okay, so maybe the show wasn't the same integrity driven concept anymore, the Cast had grown, in more ways then one, and some of the leads in the Cast were being gyped too, with poor cheesey redo plots from other shows. But there were still heart felt episodes, that some of us only dream of watching, & owning, no matter how foolish, stupid or baddly it turned out. After all like Such as the wear, & tear war time, (which, don't be fooled, is all the time.) for both family, & friends, when the ROTC- program get's out of hand, in the school of the ARTS?! This was an important ep for kids to see, then, & saddly still today.

The question is, is it right to be in a war, that kids have no involvement with, or in. My Dad was a Vet, he received the Bronze star, for his valor in battle. When he lost half his battalion to the enemy, and only wished he died along with them, he threw the star over board, in a act of defiance, for the way his Army friends demises were treated. This ep. is as important as that little message. I would have liked to see peter Bradey have been drafted into a war he has no business being in. & what his dim witted family would have been going through, if he was missing in action. Fame at least tackled the prospect, of kids going to war, & misunderstanding, they may never live, or having to live through it, shell shocked, ruined, denied help from a Govenment they went to war for, & to be ignored by a America they were forced to fight for, in the first place. After that, there is no Peace time for these Vets, ever again.
Yet, we're denied, & thrown a tidbit of the Fame world we once loved, and knew, 1 & 2 the Complete boxed set, which fails to even show a retro spective in the only bonus we get as beloved fans, now & then. It's just about the new film?

All because they released the new film, which has less heart felt, care & friendships, the human qaulities that we loved in the first, are somewhat dismissed & a more competive edge, for the me Generation. which can't compare. We loved Fame cause we felt for the Characters, they became our family every week. And we cherished that they existed, where we were fed insipped, fake family entertainment down our throats, like The Bradey Bunch. I felt not only far removed from these carbon copy, pathetic character family. And wanted them and they're horrible acting to change, and GO AWAY...
Fame was refreshing, inspiring, & the performers in the leads & supporting cast, they're experiances, & multi tallented realistic problems, were more palitable, & believable, because it was heart felt.
And each person, young, and old was concidered, to have faults, to have real emotinos, and real love for performing, teaching, and excelling & going for what they believed in. & it had good hearted humor as well as desperation, & the fears that the kids expressed each week. This show deserves a better revival, and so do us Fame, family fans, Fame lives forever for us, because it was so real, and special for us all. It was a better time, and I miss it, nothing todaze- can hope to compare to the oringinality the Fame kids had. It's too bad that even today they miss they're rightful place in Tv history as being one of the greats & we miss out on seeing & getting it all on Dvd- Lo F 4 evr- BB",1273536000,3,5812,4.360110803324099
