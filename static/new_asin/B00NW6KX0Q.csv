6682173,5,B00NW6KX0Q,"Little Busters Refrain is the second, final season of Little Busters that cover Yuiko, Rin and the Refrain routes from the original visual novel by KEY. Fans of Clannad, Angel Beats, Kanon and AIR will surely enjoy this if you already watched the first season.

My only hope from Sentai Filmworks now is that they will license the EX 8 episode OVA series that covers Sasamis route, Kanata's route and Saya's (my fav) route based on the extra Ecstasy port of the game. So Sentai, please license Little Busters EX!",1417996800,6,512,4.688888888888889

8680633,5,B00NW6KX0Q,Beyond exceptional wrap to an already exceptional series. I don't believe a single thing could have been done differently to improve Refrain. I was floored...and so happy to have added the series to my ever-expanding collection.,1431043200,,228,5.361111111111111
8680634,5,B00NW6KX0Q,"Deceptive anime, starts out as a gentle slice of life, then evolves into an action packed sci fi thriller. Do Riki and Rin have what it takes to survive the friendship of the Little Busters? All is revealed in the final episodes.",1430265600,,229,4.476190476190476
8680635,5,B00NW6KX0Q,"Little Busters Refrain is the sequel to Little Busters.  Do NOT watch Refrain if you have not finished the first season, it is not the kind of anime where you can start watching at any time.  That being said for those who watched the first season and are wondering whether or not they should watch season two, the answer is yes, you should.  Had I rated Little Busters! just off of season 1 I probably would have only given the series 3.5 out of 5 stars, however, after watching Refrain I would rate the entire series as 5 stars.  Watching refrain will make you look at the events of season 1 in a completely different way.  Also, beware that after watching a few episodes of Refrain, you will not want to stop until the end, it is that good.",1428969600,,742,4.309352517985611
