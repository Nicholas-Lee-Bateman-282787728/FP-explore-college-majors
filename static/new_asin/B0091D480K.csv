5241673,3,B0091D480K,"This film was released as ""Expecting Mary"" in 2010.
It it the story of 16 year old Mary who is pregnant and running away from a domineering mother.
We meet Mary as she is 8 months pregnant and hitches a ride with truck driver Hector to travel to L.A. to see her rock star father and have her baby. Along the way Hector stops to see his showgirl friend Darnella. Darnella forms a motherly bond with Mary and when Mary's father leaves to tour with his rock band, Mary returns to Darnella and her eccentric companions at a trailer park to have her baby.
While the acting is good and the story is pleasant enough there are questions left unanswered.
Who is the father of Mary's baby and what was Mary's relationship with him? Was it a one-night stand or a broken romance? Does the father know that Mary is pregnant? The Father of Mary's baby is not mentioned.
Mary has been on the run for 3 months before we meet her. How has she survived? Why hasn't she reached her father in L.A. if that was her goal?
When the baby is born Mary's mother suddenly transforms from the wicked Witch of the West to the sugar-sweet Witch of the East. A gradual transformation would be more realistic.
While this is a feel-good movie with a happy ending is doesn't rise to any great heights. 3 stars",1351036800,6,1275,4.361344537815126
