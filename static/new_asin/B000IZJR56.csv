All is done successfully in a style of its own. born and bred in India. It's neither Bollywood nor parallel cinema. Very mature and fulfilling unlike 95% of current Hindi films. It's quite violent at times, and has some possibly (politically) offensive dialogues, but it's all done sincerely and never feels over the top.

The story is revealed through letters exchanged between the three protagonists Siddharth, Geeta and Vikram. Everything unfolds through their eyes, anecdotes and views about the politically charged atmosphere in Eastern India during the first part of Indira Gandhi's Administration. Siddharth is from a multi cultural wealthy family. Geeta is from a large traditional south Indian family, but has studied abroad, has lived little in India. Vikram is the son of a Gandhian congressman who respects his father's ways, but constantly struggles to break free of his inheritance.

After graduation, Siddharth and Geeta decide to take part in the Naxalite uprising in Bihar. They start working amongst peasants fighting disease epidemics and constant persecution from Thakurs and the police. Meanwhile Vikram grows into a witty opportunist who deals with corrupt politicians and aristocrats. The backdrop perhaps contributes more to the film than the love story. The viewer is  left with a memorable impression of the social make up of India in 70s in all its complexities. I won't write more about the story. It's an experience and deserves repeated viewings.

Ghalib's 'Hazaaron Khwahishein aisi' sung by Shubha Mudgal appears from time to time. It's simply the essence of the story distilled into a Gazal. Rest of the album is made of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's Qawwalis and piercing aalaaps, another really good song at the end by Swanand Kirkire and Bihari folk songs.

Watch it.

By the way, the DVD cover here couldn't be more misleading. It might make one think they're ordering something like Dabang or Golmaal 6.",1290470400,,2064,5.164670658682635
