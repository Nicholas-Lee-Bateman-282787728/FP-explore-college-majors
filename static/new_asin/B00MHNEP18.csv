8672385,5,B00MHNEP18,"Years ago I was stationed in Osaka, Japan.  So my japanese isn't that bad.  So I could follow the story without english subs.  If you enjoyed ""A Woman Called Fujiko Mine"" (from Funimation).  You'd like this very much.  If you're a Lupin the Third fan, you'd probably love it!  It's directed by Takeshi Koike (same director for Woman Called Fujiko Mine).  His dedication to detail is known the world over.  This is a very good looking anime!  If you can wait, Discotek Media will be releasing it around spring of 2016.  It will be their first english-dub production.  I definitely recommend anything that Discotek does.",1447632000,2,618,4.79047619047619
8672386,4,B00MHNEP18,"I enjoyed this DVD very much.  I love the designs, the characterization, the action, the style of animation, you name it.  If you liked the 'Woman Called Fujiko Mine' TV series, you should give this a look.  Just make sure you have a working knowledge of Japanese...

On to the reasons why this doesn't get 5 stars even though it centres on one of my favourite anime characters of all time...  While a lot of people referred to this as the 'Jigen Movie,' that is a bit of a misnomer.  It's actually set up as a continuation of the previously mentioned TV series with this being two additional episodes, complete with two sets of opening/end credits.  The entire 'movie' is less than one hour long.  Honestly, I knew that going in.  What I didn't know is that for a significant portion of the movie - let's say over one third to possibly one half - the character the anime is supposed to focus on isn't even present.  Seriously, Jigen don't get no love.  It's starting to get a little annoying.  The story gives us a very good reason for why that is, and I do like the story, especially the 'surprise' ending (viewers will need to have studied their Lupin history or it will be a bit puzzling), which I found enjoyable.  I just feel that perhaps a little less emphasis on Fujiko-naked-in-the-perv-club-covered-in-lube-and-being-menaced-by-a-disturbing-thing and more on the title character.  Of course, it helps that Fujiko is not my preference.  For those whose eyes just bugged out of their heads at the thought of naked Fujiko covered in lube, you really, Really need to buy this DVD.  You will have satisfaction.

I need to mention that I have minimal need for translation, so the fact that this DVD is in Japanese only is not a problem.  Do NOT purchase this DVD expecting a dub/sub/anything not in Japanese.  Yes, there appears to be some writing on the box that is in English, but that's as good as it'll get.  As to the box and its contents, that was both pleasant and surprising.  Japanese DVDs/Blu-Rays are notoriously thin on extras.  Usually the most I see is a movie trailer, possibly a few TV advertisements.  This has commentary tracks (I hardly ever see that) and two art/note books that are printed nicely on decent paper.  Very good stuff.  I found the entire package to be very much worth the price.  Highly recommended to Lupin III fans, so long as they understand the caveats I've mentioned.

WARNING:  There are two books included in the box set, as I said above.  One has a cover with line art printed on a black background, the other has colour art printed on a white background.  The book with the colour art/white background has a MAJOR SPOILER in it for the 'surprise' ending.  If you want to experience the surprise, Do Not Look Through That Book Before You Watch The DVD.  Remember: it's less than an hour long.  Exercise restraint.",1421020800,,2860,4.644710578842315
