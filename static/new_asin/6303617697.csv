7852615,4,6303617697,"If you liked the ""Alien Nation"" t.v. series (and I can't imagine why you wouldn't), then you will like this movie because it finishes all of the questions that were left unanswered when the idiot network cancelled the series.  However, I only gave it 4 stars because parts of it are a little disjointed and because of the four made for t.v. movies that they made after the series ended, this one is my least favorite.  If you want to see an absoulute fabulous movie about the alien nation series, then you should watch ""The Udara Legacy"".  It's REALLY cool.  Also, there were several books that were written to continue the stories (some of them from the writters who worked on the series), and of those I HIGHLY recommend ""Extreme Prejudice"". I always wanted them to turn that book into a made for T.V. movie.",1161216000,,810,4.56551724137931
7852616,3,6303617697,"""Dark Horizon"" has an exceptionally well-written plot, but the characters leave something to be desired.  Aphassno, sent to Earth to retrieve the slaves, is a fascinating character even if he ocasionally  moves his head like Michael Myers.  However, the symbolism gets VERY  heavy-handed at times and I was forced to fast-foward.  Cathy and Sykes  have no chemistry, and the time wasted on developing their relationship is  incredibly boring.  She and Aphassno are far more believable as lovers and  I wish their affair had been more developed.  Still, it is a fascinating  movie and worth your while, especially if you were a fan of the show.",956620800,3,643,5.0285714285714285

However, if that could happen, it would not be without it's predjudices as depicted in the movie. It was so  realistic! Watch it and I gurantee you the Tenctonese will seem just like  your next door neighbors! This is a very thought provoking,emotional film.  I highly recommend it!",937526400,4,385,4.632352941176471
