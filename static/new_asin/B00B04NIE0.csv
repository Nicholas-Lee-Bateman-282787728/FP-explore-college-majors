8560126,1,B00B04NIE0,"Awful. Just Awful.
Before viewing the DVD I thought it was impossible to screw up and NOT convey the natural beauty found in the Boundary Waters.
I was wrong.
The videography doesn't even approach one-star rating. Poorly shot. Poorly written. Poorly constructed as a documentary. And I never warmed to the narrator's voice, pacing or inflection. Check out narrator's pronunciation of ""Isle Royale"".
It is readily apparent that the people who produced this did not venture far from shore. Some of my personal favorites are the ""B-roll"" shots of a paddle dipping through the water with the side of ""the boat"" - not canoe - in the frame. And the man walking and pondering shots are hilarious. My bet, the man deep in thought is one of the ""videographers"" for this waste of your time.

This video is not a representative tour of the Boundary Waters. I would give it less than one star if given the option.",1422576000,,901,4.7025316455696204

8560128,5,B00B04NIE0,"Howdy;

Don't know if it was 4th released, but fourth in ""Eagle's View"" video.

Again, the narration and music are great even for Dolby 2.0.  The video is all it should be for HD.

The price is outstanding for a running time of 70 minutes.

Hope this helps, L8R daze...",1378080000,,269,4.3
8560129,1,B00B04NIE0,"I am taking a trip to the Boundary Waters and wanted to learn about the place so bought this video. I was hoping for an experience that would provide me not only beautiful landscape videography, but also compelling AND comprehensive information and facts about the park's history, geography, flora + fauna, and other pertinent information for someone interested in a unique biome.

This DVD had nothing of that. The videography was poorly filmed (ever heard of a steady cam?). Most of the chapters decided to focus on people's feelings and subjective interpretations about specific topics instead of detailed informative explanations.

The only thing I learned was that Beavers, Elephants and Humans are the only 3 species to alter their landscape to create a more livable environment.

Any other DVD, if one exists about the Boundary Waters, is worth it.

Don't buy it.",1374624000,3,870,5.105633802816901
