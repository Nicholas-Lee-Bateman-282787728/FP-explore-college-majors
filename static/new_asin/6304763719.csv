7877043,1,6304763719,"THE WONDERS OF WILDLIFE...AT THE EXPENSE OF PLOT.

Action of this traditional adventure film is set in strife-rent Angola, where James Mallory (Stanley Brock, with a vigorous performance), his wife Karen (Anne Collings) and their three teen-aged sons make their residence while operating at the site a private wildlife preserve, until their lives are disrupted by members of a militant political faction. James and his offspring are asked to assist a neighbouring rancher, Lars (Ivan Tors) who needs help with moving his large herd of elands to safety past the nation's border and away from the encroaching insurgents, but their vehicle breaks down and the four men are segmented in their attempts to seek aid, while Karen is isolated as residents flee the spreading combat zone. As the youngest son, restricted by a broken ankle, remains with the incapacitated vehicle, his brothers attempt to return, through perilous jungle, to their home and mother, while James wends his solitary way, made hazardous by wild animals in addition to brutal soldiers, to an outpost wherein government forces are stationed, the storyline moving about among several foci of danger. A genuine fondness by producer Tors for Africa is manifest here through the many scenes of wild fauna, easily the most interesting portions of the work, although his acting is wooden as is that of the three brothers from the Tors clan who portray the scenario's sibling trio, with the film's strongest performance delivered by Collings. Suspense is a requirement in order for a work of this type to be successful, but several factors are operating against this effort, notably its frequent essays into comedy involving animals; a score that is continually sprightly and inconsequent for scenes of potential danger; flawed continuity; but all in all, it is a fairly pleasant movie, offensive only to aesthetic touchstones, despite its predictability.",1206489600,,1914,5.254901960784314
