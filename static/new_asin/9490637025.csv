7901678,5,9490637025,"I've always been an admirer of film title sequences, but never knew it's a stand-alone form of art in the film making process.
Well, now I do. And this DVD provides for the first time an opportunity to appreciate this art through a collection of some of the most creative work samples in this field.
The big surprise was that most of the titles belong to movies and projects that I've never heard about before!.. an additional benefit as I intend now to search and watch these movies.
You wish there are more. The amount of creativity - sometimes bizarre - and craftsmanship is outstanding. You'll come to appreciate this art form and after watching this DVD you'll pay extra attention to the title sequences in movies from now on.",1296172800,,731,4.630769230769231
