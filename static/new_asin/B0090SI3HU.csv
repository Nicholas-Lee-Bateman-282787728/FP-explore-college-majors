5217000,5,B0090SI3HU,"Now THIS is one to watch for! It is witty, intelligent, well-acted, adult, textured and beautifully acted, with a gorgeous soundtrack. Our 2012 Seattle International Film Festival audience could scarcely contain ourselves as we exited the theater. We had watched decent people trying to cope with the vagaries of growing up, each at his or her own pace, each with his or her own degree of success.

Let's look at some of these nice people:
  * Josh Radnor (""How I Met Your Mother"") is Jesse, an Admissions officer for a New York City school, called to give a speech for a former professor who is retiring at his old alma mater. He is a bookworm who says a dual English/History degree should make a graduate fully unemployable. He meets a couple of undergrads while visiting his old campus.
  * Elizabeth Olsen (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") is Zibby, a young woman wise for her years but who views a relationship with our hero as a possible short-cut to maturity. She gives him a mix-tape filled with works by dead white males, i.e., European composers Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart, Vivaldi and Shubert. That is his FIRST surprise from her! She is smart, decent and has great insight. And she LOVES ""snail mail.""
  * John Magaro (""My Soul to Take"") is Dean, the other student our hero meets on campus. This guy hates hyperbole and is terminally depressed! He keeps re-reading a book written by an author who killed himself. He's attending college because he got a ""full ride"" scholarship and his single mom is ""soooo proud!""
  * Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"") is Peter Hoberg, the professor trying to make the difficult transition to retirement.
  * Allison Janney (""The Help"") is Judith Fairfield, the acerbic professor who helped our hero learn to love dead white males (in this case the Romantic poets). She thinks he has a ""gooey heart!""
  * Elizabeth Reaser (the ""Twilight"" trilogy) is Ana, who works in a bookstore. She notices he reads dead white males, authors who shall remain nameless.
  * Zac Efron (""The Lucky One"") is Nat, who may or may not exist....

Writer/director Josh Radnor (""Happythankyoumoreplease"") has a great future ahead. He doesn't talk down to his audience, his characters are literate, witty, decent and earnest. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and Radnor's bittersweet views on aging and age differences are very realistic. We laughed at his stunned reaction to a ""Vampire"" trilogy. This is top notch! Amazon.com will notify me when the DVD is available.",1348444800,23,2487,4.913875598086125

5217122,5,B0090SI3HU,"Not a fast-paced movie by any means and I'm not a big fan of Josh Radnor's by any means but good watch.  It resonated with me as I'm one of the staunch supporters of the stance that paper books will never ""go out of fashion"" to be replaced by digital media.  Each has it's place but there's just something about the excitement of a book, whether it be classical or modern fiction, non-fiction, or whatnot.
I think there's also a good nod to the fact that connections happen when we least expect them and, oftentimes, in places we look the least.  ;)",1461888000,2,549,4.362745098039215
5217123,3,B0090SI3HU,"It was a cute, yet deep story.  I just think it moved rather slowly at some points. It was sadder than I thought it would be. I'd recommend it if you like fairly intellectual stories.",1461024000,,183,4.228571428571429
5217124,4,B0090SI3HU,"There's no ""Plastics"" moment in Josh Radnor's smart, under-the radar gem Liberal Arts, you know, the moment when the entire artifice of youthful idealism is left in shambles by the impending compromises of adulthood - captured forever in the genius of one, eternal catch-phrase. What the film delivers is a deft, finely crafted screenplay full of uncanny wit and wisdom that examines the intersecting lives of five past and present citizens of Ohio's leafy green collegiate oasis, Kenyon College.

Through the prism of a forced retirement ""party"" for Political Science Professor Peter Hoberg (another gem from veteran character actor Richard Jenkins) Radnor's, Josh, a Kenyon Alum who is now battling the first stages of mid-life ennui as a university admissions officer in NYC, returns as reluctant toastmaster for his mentors party. Josh is a slightly sullen man of letters who reads while he walks and can never pass an independent bookstore unexplored.

While there, he meets Elizabeth Olsen's ""Zibby,"" a precocious, lithe and winsome 19 y/o undergrad who can't wait to fast forward through her messy twenties straight into Radnor's mid-thirties world of importance and intellectual rigor, or so she thinks. I have to admit that very early on I was eyeing the exit button on the remote fully expecting this potentially over-the-top, girl meets world gabfest to make me regret the ""talkie"" was ever invented. To my eternal surprise their conversations and old-school letter writings were surprisingly realistic and genuine almost foreshadowing a relationship better suited to the intimacy of unbreakable friendship than the intimacy of the darkened room.

Along the way Josh runs into a philosopher-stoner named Nat (Zac Efron doing his best Jeff Spicoli) and the manic-depressive, perpetually suicidal campus genius, Dean (an engaging performance by John Maguro) who are there to give color and dimension to the edges of the plot-line but are not essential.

The only sour note is turned in from a usually reliable scene-stealer, Allison Janney who was Josh's favorite professor as an undergrad but is now nothing but a loveless husk, whose joie de vivre has been drained by a life of too few human connections and too many barrooms. She is the bold-face (and wholly unnecessary) Mrs. Robinson to Radnor's Benjamin Braddock who almost single handedly upends the poignancy of a remarkable script.

For what could have very easily been a throwaway rom-com dressed in oxfords and chinos, Liberal Arts is a slyly perceptive take on human transitions and the endless forks-in-the road that many seldom see. It is extremely well produced and scripted, minus of course the manic ride in the Alfa Romeo and is well worth your time.",1460937600,2,2727,5.2027334851936216

5217126,5,B0090SI3HU,"This movie is much more than some feel good college movie. The title ""Liberal Arts"" gives the impression this is some typical indie movie about people going nowhere. Perhaps something along the lines of the show The Community. The truth is, this movie should appeal to all walks of life. Olsen nails the role of the student in a rush to grow up. Radnor is a great lead, riding a whimsical line between nostalgia and responsibility, and Richard Jenkins delivers some amazingly relatable lines about what it really means to be an adult. The cast is all at the top of their game, the writing is intelligent and thought provoking. I don't think I've seen a movie this spot on and sincere since High Fidelity. Absolutely delightful.",1455062400,2,727,4.732283464566929
5217127,5,B0090SI3HU,"This is such a great movie! There are so many things I appreciate about it. It's realistic, it's nostalgic, it illustrates what it's like to revisit a wonderful experience from the past, while also accurately showing what it's like to wonder about the present day and what will come of the future. It's great to see how the characters cross paths and how their relationships develop. It's really nice when a movie slowly takes you through experiences so you, as a viewer, also get to experience what they're experiencing. I think there are a lot of real life topics in this movie and I just can't say enough good things about it. I recommend this movie to others all the time!

While the romance of these two was clever and charming...in the end it wasn't as interesting if the focus would have been on the way the professor deals with his retirement/life.",1447200000,,536,4.393939393939394

I rate this one a star above Radnor's last film (HappyThankYouMorePlease), because it is more personal and formed by story-telling, as opposed to theme-oriented. Don't worry about ""The New York Times"" rating, since I'm sure the author didn't write for them as much as for you. I think every artist has a biographical piece or two tucked away in his heart, and although I don't know Josh Radnor personally, I'll bet this is one of his.

5217273,2,B0090SI3HU,"After listening to the wtf podcast with josh radnor talking about this film, it's easy to see that he got way off track with this movie because he didn't stick to his guns on the professor story. The love angle this movie takes is so boring on the face of it and never amounts to much.  You intuitively know he'll end up with someone else who is foreshadowed very early in the movie and he has morality problems with taking the virginity of a nubile improv starlet? Uh huh, you just wasted anyone's time who came to the movie expecting an honest situation. The reality is the 30 year old usually does the bidding of 19 year old and enjoys it as attachment-free sex as a coming of age lesson. What we have here is platonic flirting with romance. I hate that.  Zac Ephron is ok as the Spirit guide, but he's still wrong for the role no matter how quirky you make him up.  Preppy don't get dirty like the bohemians, they still look like they belong in a catalogue, or calendar. Radnor should stop writing from a muse perspective and just do standard plot lines spiced up with his quirky lines and characters. That way we don't feel we watched a film with little to no progression and feel our soul slowly leaving us.  Instead, we feel that the filmmaker understands the concept of kinetic motion through plot and we enjoy his quirky, left of center take on enjoyably contrived situations. He's a talented man, but he can't play it by ear and this movie is the proof.",1415318400,,1463,4.407407407407407
5217274,4,B0090SI3HU,"I don't know Josh Radnor, but judging from his role in ""How I Met Your Mother"" and his freshman outing with ""Happythankyoumoreplease"" I'd guess him to be a decent guy. Now with this endeavor ""Liberal Arts"" it really seems to drive that home.

Here's the scoop. Jesse Fisher (Radnor) Is an admissions officer at a New York college who heads back to his Alma Mater in Ohio to speak at the retirement party of one of his old professors. While there he meets a young student, Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen) with whom he feels a strong attraction. This, coupled with much else that is going on around him, causes him to rethink the road he's on.

This is a cool flick. Maybe a bit too cool. Much of the padder is a bit too insightful and clever. The characters are a bit too self aware. Don't get me wrong. I like this sort of thing but it strayed a little too far from reality in the way people are. One character was fun, but he was so over the top he was difficult to swallow. To its credit it tackles some heady stuff. Such as: How much difference should age make? Can a job become a prison? Should people only read ""good"" literature even though it might not be as fun as pulp literature? These are just a few of the subjects he tackles and he does a nice job of it. I have more than a few years under my belt and it had me looking at these things in a new light.

I did like the writing and acting The characters are all distinct and played well. Radnor's retiring professor, played well by the penultimate character actor Richard Jenkins, has one scene that is painful to watch in its depiction of a man afraid to enter into retirement. The movie is shot nicely. The scenes depicting the greenness of Ohio are beautiful. The music, editing and so forth are all on par with the project.

What is happening here, as in most indy endeavors, is the writing and the acting. My hat is of to Josh Radnor here. This is a noble effort. It's probably not quite worth the four stars I gave it but I liked it four stars worth. Put this on your list. It's well worth your time.",1415145600,,2058,4.24234693877551
5217275,2,B0090SI3HU,"Tries too hard to seem witty. The scene with the written letters back and forth was the worst...this directing just reminds me of Zachary Braff's films, where he is always dealing with younger, attractive women who would never actually be interested in him in real life.",1414368000,,270,4.891304347826087
5217276,2,B0090SI3HU,"I tried to like this. No, really. I wanted to like it so, so badly. Josh Radnor is a really talented guy, and Roger Ebert gave ""Liberal Arts"" a good review.

Yeah. Well. The movie wasn't completely hideous. It had its good points. There just weren't enough to make it all worth it. First of all, I absolutely get Jesse's desire to go down Memory Lane and reconnect with what made life exciting. We've all done that at one point (or several). However, Jesse makes some bizarre choices along the way. As a writer, I understand that characters don't always do what they're supposed to, but some actions are so out of left-field that the audience can't help but get weirded out. The weirdest moment for me in ""Liberal Arts"" was seeing Jesse turn down sex with a nineteen-year old, but then jump in bed with his former lit professor. This is a slightly disturbing chain of events as it is, but what made it jump the shark was Jesse's own incredulous expression when Professor What's-Her-Name is seducing him. How does he go from that to watching her light a post-coital cigarette from the other side of her bed?

Again, I get where Radnor was coming from here, but the overall product was disappointing. Just a little bit of tweaking would have made this film a winner. But, hindsight, right? I still like Josh Radnor, and I'm looking forward to seeing whatever he's got ahead of him.",1414368000,3,1379,4.578947368421052
5217277,4,B0090SI3HU,"Every five years I return to my alma college for our class reunion. While there I feel like I'm 20 again. When I watched ""Liberal Arts"" I could relate to the character played by Josh Radner.

The story line is familiar: young (sophomore) girl falls for older guy (back on campus for the first time in more than a decade), ""older guy"" has too much respect to have sex with younger woman, and ends up having a one-night stand with an older, world-weary woman, who was one of his professors (and apparently an idealistic one) when he was an undergrad.

The characters make this an interesting story. Each one wants to be what they are not . . . older or younger. No one is quite satisfied with life at the moment.

The various messages in the movie--the shallowness of current youth culture, the disillusionment of the aging, and the loneliness of people who are surrounded by people--could have been a bit heavy-handed. Thankfully it wasn't, although the themes are spelled out clearly. Like a truly good story, the characters show . . . don't tell.

There's not a lot of comedy in this film. It is romantic and bittersweet. It's worth an hour and a half of your time. Good acting all around.",1414108800,,1190,4.546728971962617

Admittedly, the 5th of the stars I'm giving this flick probably has something to do with my having been, like our hero here, a Liberal Arts English major at an Ohio college who's been long gone, never went back and has sometimes wondered what doing so might be like.  Well, now I kinda sorta know,  at least from a warm and fuzzy opposite gender perspective.

Though Radnor will always be Ted Mosby in my eye, his portrayal of a post college graduate is quite convincing.  His performance is one that says he is well aware of HIMYM audience and that he is type cast, and owns it.  He is that stuck up professor type who has to tell stories and thinks what he likes is universally liked by everyone.  Only when he meets Olsen does he learn that it is okay to just enjoy things, even if they aren't that great (Twilight Novels).

5217414,5,B0090SI3HU,"This movie is smart in many ways.  The plot is neatly laid out - no complicated flashbacks, just developing the story line from A to B.  The characters - most of them at least - are intelligent and witty. They don't sit around and talk about sex and relationships all the time like they do in some movies. Books, philosophy - a lot of ground is covered in their conversations.  I write novels in my spare time and I like to fill them with characters I wouldn't mind spending time with - and this movies accomplishes the same thing.  It also reminded me of when I went to college and why I liked the atmosphere there so much.

I won't go over the plot in detail; read the description above for that.  This movie didn't use the normal romantic comedy formula.  The two leads didn't fall into bed early on before running into the standard problem that causes a break-up.  In fact, Jesse is 16 years older than student Zebby, and he actually gives the age difference serious consideration in a great scene before going back to visit Zebby later in the movie.  Even when I was ready for the two leads to become lovers, there was a plot twist waiting for me there.  You get used to shallow characters in movies sometimes, but Jesse is a genuinely caring and thoughtful person,

If you can write a smart and witty script, avoid the romantic comedy cliches and surprise me here and there, you've created a great movie. For example, in most films of this sort, the lead character has to do some grand gesture at the end to win back their true love. Often this gesture is a repeat or reworking of something from early in their relationship. In this movie, Jesse sort of reworks a scene in a bookstore from earlier in the film, but it isn't to win Zebby and it leads him in a totally different direction. If that sounds vague - well, I don't want to spoil anything for you.

Another smart thing about this movie is that it doesn't neglect the secondary characters.  A few other characters Jesse meets on the college campus could have been just thrown in and discarded, but the characters recur. One of them is a sort of magical character who advises Jesse on life, another is a former teacher who he admired but finds less reason for doing so now, and the third one emerges as a character who not only develops in the course of the movie, but who also helps Jesse grow.

The ending was another surprise to me, though as it drew closer I began to realize where it was headed.  It surprised me because it didn't take the easy way out.  It reminded me of the book Circle of Friends, where the main character forgives the boy who broke her heart and allows him to return to the circle - as just her friend. But when the movie version was made, they couldn't resist pushing it into a typical (and rather unrealistic) happy ending. This movie has a happy ending, but not the easy one I might have expected.",1391817600,,2889,4.392120075046904

5217468,5,B0090SI3HU,"With so many heartbreaking films in the cinema today, it is refreshing to encounter and engage with Josh Radnor's Liberal Arts, a heart mending film.  A film that dares to say that things aren't that bad, in a time when cynicism runs rampant through the streets.  And I don't know about you, but I could use a healthy dose of optimism in the movies I watch.  Josh Radnor grabs cynicism by the shoulder and gently leads him out of the movie theater, while calmly embracing compassion, awareness, and unabashed optimism.  Josh Radnor may just be the soul that saves all of our weary souls.  Josh's innate ability to create and inspire is one of the most over-looked talents today.  How is this guy not on the front page of the newspaper every day?  If you haven't seen Liberal Arts, then you need to get on that.  It is by no means a run of the mill romantic comedy with cliched dialogue and unrealistic dramatic debacles.  It is a beautiful symphony of impeccable directorial finesse, precise subtle nuanced acting, and a wonderfully aware script with resonant quotes that stay with you long after you leave the theatre.

Josh's clear vision for Liberal Arts really paid off.  The beautiful cadence with which each actor speaks is unmatched by any other movie(not that it's a competition, but it's totally a competition, and Liberal Arts wins, by a landslide, a very peaceful landslide that has no casualties, just bruised egos perhaps).  With these unique, intriguing characters, it's no wonder there is never a dull moment in this movie.  Jesse Fisher(Josh Radnor), is a 35-year old college admissions counselor, who is less than enthused about his career, and returns to his alma mater, Kenyon College, for one of his favorite professor's retirement dinners.  While on campus, he becomes entranced by the spirited, effervescent Zibby(Elizabeth Olsen), a 19-year old student, and complications ensue.  A pleasant surprise in the film is the affable, ethereal Nat(Zac Ephron), who extoles wisdom effortlessly and with grace, as if he is plugged in to some universal truth.  The cast is rounded out with Richard Jenkins, Allison Janney, Elizabeth Reaser, and John Magaro, who each give stellar performances in their own right.  Richard Jenkins is an absolute delight, bringing his trademark wonderful energy to the film.  He plays Professor Peter Hoberg, who is struggling with his retirement from teaching.  Allison Janney is at her best, playing a spit fire of a character as Jesse's former teacher.  Elizabeth Reaser gives an endearing performance as a lovable bookworm who crosses Jesse's path.  And last but definitely not least, John Magaro gives a moving performance as a student struggling to find his place in the collegiate world.  With so many great characters, it is difficult not to relate to them all (note: unless you are emotionally devoid).  A beautifully sad common thread that strings these characters together is their dissatisfaction with the way things are.  Perhaps the real message behind Liberal Arts is that if you can stop struggling against life, and just go with the flow, you will be happier for it.  You will realize that, ""Everything is okay,"" as the ever-present Nat reminds us.

Liberal Arts is not only about love and the intricacies of relationships, it's a celebration of books and music, while also being a great mirror for some self-reflection.  It deals with a multitude of subjects such as:  morality, grace, rejection, self-esteem, divinity, ethics, and aging.  With the jaded perspective of our society being that youth is good and aging in any way, shape, or form is bad, it is uniquely refreshing to hear that aging can be a lovely process that you get to take part in.  Beyond just that, I believe that Radnor is also trying to reveal to his audience that any part of life can be enjoyed, even if, or perhaps, especially if, society has marked it as unenjoyable.  It is all about your perspective, and how you perceive the event to unfold.  In addition to being just blatantly brilliant, Liberal Arts has these delectable morsels of inspirational quotes sprinkled throughout the film.  Here are just a few of my favorites: ""Any place you don't leave is a prison"", ""Grace, I realized, is neither time nor place dependent; all we need is the right soundtrack"", and ""Fortune never smiles on those who say no"".  These lovely, luminous gems in this soul-satisfying movie carry with them an enduring resonance.  Don't be surprised when you find yourself, days later, contemplating them in a reverie.

You can enjoy the ninety-seven minutes of Liberal Arts and then go back to your normal everyday life, or you can fully embrace the sage advice that lives within the movie, let it permeate your soul, and permanently improve the circumstances of your life.  Simply allow your mind to ruminate on the heartfelt wisdom of the movie.  Let the words and ideas roll around in your head and in your heart, like clothes in a dryer, until they are carefully arranged and neatly folded in your mind.  Watching Liberal Arts is like eating a delicately planned out meal in a restaurant.  You may not know how it was made, or what exactly is in it, but by the end, you leave with a delightful feeling in your gut, a happy smile on your face, and an overall pleasant feeling of satiety.  Feeling like you are in on a life secret.  While watching it, you get this feeling that you are basking in greatness; that there is something greater than yourself struggling to emerge.  Like any great movie, you walk out of it not only with a huge grin on your face, but also believing that the characters really do exist somewhere out in the world.  To me, there is no greater compliment to a writer than that.

It's as if somehow Josh Radnor found his way into your mind, extracted all the worthy treasures of your subconscious, then took everything that you have wanted to express and say to the world, and turned it into this wonderful, heartfelt movie.  Pinpointing emotions you didn't know that you had.  Extoling wisdom that you wish you had been able to put into words.  Josh Radnor is daring to blaze a trail into uncharted territory in Hollywood, creating a genuinely uplifting film.  Trying to break down the walls of cliched, predictable, explosion-driven movies, and attempting to build up the confidence of the audience.  A rare trait for any filmmaker to exude these days.  And he does it with such elegance and grace, finding a way straight into our hearts.",1372896000,31,6487,4.846503178928247

5217546,4,B0090SI3HU,"This is a very charming film about the nostalgia of youth and the paradox that everyone wants to be young, except the young themselves. Josh Radnors script is well written and witty in many parts. Radnor plays his character Jesse quite blank and though he is in almost every scene he makes room for the supporting actors. Both Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney stand out as middleaged academics unhappy with the way their lifes have gone. Zac Efron does a surprisingly good cameo as a wacky non-stundent hanging around the campus befriending Jesse and giving him alternately good and weird advice. But the true deal is Elizabeth Olsen who is stunning as the 19-year old student Zibby who is attracted to Jesse. Everytime she is on screen the film radiates. Zibby is the dream girl that's almost to good to be true. Beautiful, charming and in most ways wiser than Jesse. It's impossible not to fall in love with her.

SPOILER ALERT: Their friendship slowly moves towards love until the moment of truth arrives. The scene when Zibby opens up to Jesse and wants to make their relationship physical is the most moving scene of the film. I have thought backwards and forwards about the ending. Josh Radnor is probably trying to make a point about growing up and motivates Jesses refusal to go to bed with Zibby on moral grounds. But I really think that Jesse (or Radnor) made the wrong choice. Zibby was so delightful and mature. Her feelings for Jesse where sincere. No man with a sane mind should turn her down. I don't understand how Jesse can leave her after severla months of romancing without a single regret.

In Martha Marcy May Marlene Elizabeth Olsen proved her ability to handle dark material. In Liberal Arts she shows that she is equally good in lighter films. I really look forward to seing more of her.",1367020800,2,1813,4.69811320754717

5217603,5,B0090SI3HU,"Walking across a college campus is an evocative image, conjuring halcyon days of unfettered didactic discourse and effortlessly lateral social expansion.  I felt that way before I had been to college, imagining it as some cobblestoned Shangri-La, splendid in both its verdant summers and the spartan white of its winters.  Once I was in college, and despite all evidence to the contrary, I continued to feel this way; with the right song on my iPod, the long humps across campus to get from one class to the next became the expeditious moments of my personal bildungsroman, the interstitial digestion of the knowledge upon which I had voraciously gorged myself.  Half a decade removed from the annals of higher learning, I still wrap the image in a soft patina of wistful yearning, understanding now, more fully than ever, that those were the moments that most perfectly encapsulated the impossibly dichotomous quintessence of university: the languid vagabonding and the rigorous intellectual pursuit, the freedom from consequence and the promise of progress, the movement outward as well as upward.

That these ephemeral, inconsequential promenades retain their gilded aura is a testimony to the promise of college more so than the actuality, as anyone who has ever crammed for a final or stayed up all night to finish a thesis can attest.  But that promise was a beautiful one, trimmed with the satisfaction of self-government and willful diligence.  Josh Radnor, no doubt, acutely understands the power of that image as a metaphor, and employs it beautifully in Liberal Arts, his second feature as writer-director-star.  What makes it a good film is his ability to illustrate the discord between the Platonic ideal and the objective reality of the university machine; what makes it a great film is Radnor's lack of cynicism and variegated perspective as he does so.

Radnor plays Jesse Fisher, an admissions officer for a university in New York, who spends virtually every waking moment of his life with a book in hand.  Recently separated from his girlfriend and worn down by the numbing redundancy of his job, Jesse, personally invited by one of his former professors to attend his retirement dinner, jumps at the chance to spend a weekend back in Ohio, traipsing about his alma mater.  The professor in question, Peter Hoberg, is one of the great collegiate archetypes: the baby boomer to whom higher education was a means of political protest and social activism who has returned to breed a generation of literate, conscious, and progressive minds.  As Peter, Richard Jenkins lends an aloof and credible ease to some of the script's broader characterizations, giving him just the right touch of integrity, authority, and self-efficacy.

While staying with Peter, Jesse is introduced to Zibby (a radiant Elizabeth Olsen), a drama student whose mother was in Peter's class years before.  Zibby has many of the trappings of the manic-pixie-dream-girl, and yet avoids all of the common pitfalls of such a character.  Assured and sprightly, Zibby senses an immediate connection between herself and Jesse despite their sixteen year age gap.  Following a chance meeting on campus later that night, Jesse agrees to meet Zibby for coffee the next day.  Zibby speaks of herself in the beautifully distilled expository manner only afforded by first dates and the movies.  She explains how her improv class has taught her to ""say yes to everything,"" and to approach life both on and off the stage with an openness to all of its possibilities; she enthuses about her Introduction to Classical Music class, which has acquainted her a world of beauty previously unknown to her.  Despite his better judgment, Jesse finds himself under Zibby's spell.

When Jesse returns to New York, Zibby leaves him with that ultimate totem of modern courtship: a mixtape.  Handing him a burned CD of pieces by Mozart, Vivaldi, Wagner, and other composers, Zibby urges Jesse to write to her -- to really write, with pen and paper.  The relationship that unfolds between them via post is innocent, erudite, and sincere, as they elucidate and share their personal relationships to the works of these great composers.  ""Grace, I realized, was neither time nor place dependent,"" Jesse writes, ""all we need is the right soundtrack.""

Radnor's deep love and respect for both the written word and the profound impact of music are apparent, but his wide-eyed, rapturous zeal for the pillars of western art prevents his appreciation from becoming too dry or scholarly.  To put a finer point to it, there is nothing snobbish about Liberal Arts, a quality which was no doubt of concern to Radnor in its writing.  In fact, ""snobbish"" is the very term Zibby lobs at Jesse when he tells her that college is not simply about understanding different points of view, but ""also about developing taste.""  That his delivery belies the implicit condescension of such a statement speaks to Radnor's strengths as both an actor and a director.  Rather than take sides with either Zibby or Jesse, Radnor recognizes the truth in the great Dylan lyric ""You're right form your side / I'm right from mine"" and the role of perspective in determining truth.  Jesse wonders aloud whether he and Zibby connect because she's advanced or because he's stunted; Radnor realizes it's because they meet somewhere in between.

I dare not reveal how Jesse and Zibby's relationship unfurls; though it is not quite unexpected, it is absolutely right, and it is rare for this sort of film to eschew the more impractical tropes of relationship films in favor of a more considered, authentic, and earned resolution.  ""Guilt before we act is called morality,"" Jesse says at one point in the film, and this struggle with the weight of consequences both real and perceived -- the ""struggle between sacred and profane love,"" to borrow his description of Wagner's Tannhauser -- comprises the film's ethical and philosophical core.

Allison Janney is reliably impeccable in a small but significant role as the British Romantic Literature professor with whom Jesse briefly reconnects and John Magaro is memorable as Dean, a sensitive, literate college student who opens up to Jesse after discovering a shared admiration for David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest.  Through Jesse's interactions with the both of them, Radnor is able to explore the pitfalls of idolatry and the moral imperative of a deep interpersonal connection.  It is in these scenes that Liberal Arts is its most altruistic, humane, and assertive in its promotion of benevolence and generosity.

As an actor, Radnor has a perfectly restrained and affable demeanor that plays well with everyone in the cast.  He's equal parts Cusack and Piven, alchemizing their strengths and downplaying the cartoonish exaggerations native to the broad suburban fantasies of the eighties.  He never feels like he's playing the straight man, but his careful understatement perfectly frames Olsen's endearing turn as Zibby.  While less natural and unaffected than she was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martha-Marcy-May-Marlene-Blu-ray/dp/B006OV7S1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martha Marcy May Marlene [Blu-ray</a>] (an appropriate choice for playing a genial drama student), Olsen is just as confident and sublime as she has ever been; she continues to be one of the most interesting and promising young actresses working today.  Zac Efron plays delightfully against type as a new-agey deus ex machina, stealing most of his few scenes.  But it's Elizabeth Reaser's effortless charm as an introverted bookstore clerk which ultimately makes her the warmest and most touching character in the film.

With Liberal Arts, Josh Radnor has not only shown significant growth as a writer and director, he has miraculously managed to romanticize both the past and the future in a manner that is both engaging and reaffirming.  ""This right now, all this stuff you're feeling,"" Jesse tells Dean late in the film, ""this is a footnote.""  That may be, but sometimes the footnotes are the most interesting parts of a story.

If you were privileged enough to attend a small, private, liberal arts college -- e.g., Kenyon, where the movie is filmed -- this movie will resonate as mostly true. Characters include the aging professor who can't function outside of academia; the alumnus who can't leave; the maturing but virginal undergrad; and the weird social outcast kid who sits alone in the dining hall and reads. Zach Effron does a small bit as an enlightened -- and somewhat mysterious but fun -- tree hugger; he plays one of the more lovable characters in the film.

This rom com has a few nice cinematic tropes -- Josh's return to college parallels his professor's inability to leave -- but it's hard for me to endorse it as anything other than a movie which will appeal to those with similar experiences.

Jesse's character  is gorgeously flawed, more of an idealist than a romantic. He still lives in a hopeful world of literature and prose, forgetting about the author's real lives that they mostly escaped from through their writing.

He's lost and struggling when he meets Zibby, a much younger college student studying at his Alma Mater. Zibby's intense and decided and everything he's looking for in the world. Her passion for classical music revives the mundane routines in his life and brings back his fervor for living. Their strong feelings for one another, connected mostly through music, letters, and books, is a natural progression that makes sense and doesn't feel awkward to viewers.

It does become awkward once their world's collide and you begin to realize they can't quite fit. When he leaves Zibby, heartbroken and raw, they begin to take their experiences with one another and help build better lives on their own.

While Jesse's later relationship with the bookkeeper who (surprise) has been under his nose the entire movie feel authentic and logical, I would have liked to see more development.

Little did I know prior to watching Liberal Arts, this is actually Josh Radnor's second film. I love him on How I Met Your Mother and almost instantly went to pick this up when I saw a preview of it on the Why Stop Now DVD. Not only does Josh Radnor play one of the main roles in the film, but he also wrote and directed the film as well. That seems like a lot of work to take on by one man, so how does the film hold up?

In my opinion, Liberal Arts is wonderful. The film follows 35 year old Jesse Fisher (Radnor) through what is essentially a turning point in his life. He works in New York City as a college admissions counselor when he receives a call from one of his old college professors, Peter Hoberg (Richard Jenkins). Peter is retiring soon and he wants Jesse to be at the retirement dinner that the school is throwing for him. Jesse, obviously somewhat disappointed with his life thus far, accepts.

As Jesse arrives in Ohio he meets a young 19 year old woman named Elizabeth (Elizabeth Olsen), or Zibby for short. As luck would have it, a spark emerges between the two and they become pen pals for a couple of months. That is, until Zibby asks for Jesse to come and visit her. As I type this short summary it feels weird and, please believe me, it really isn't. I won't go into further detail, but as odd as the premise may seem in text, in motion it's wonderful to watch.

I'm a sucker for movies like this. I like to consider them diamonds in the rough because there obviously won't be a huge following for Liberal Arts. It isn't an over the top action flick, it isn't an unbelievable love story, there are no good guys, and there are no bad guys. Liberal Arts is a heartfelt story about one man realizing that things in life can be good and that it's ok to actually enjoy life. All he needed was the help of two college students, Zibby and Dean (John Magaro), an old Romantics professor (Allison Janney), and Nat (Zac Efron).

From start to finish this film, for me, was a joy to watch. The story was sincere and everyone, and I do mean everyone, gave fantastic performances. The most surprising to me, though, was Efron's performance as Nat. I've only seen Efron in two roles, that god-awful High School Musical and the mediocre 17 Again. Nat's character is somewhat of an enigma so I won't attempt to describe him in words, but Efron nailed it and definitely gained some respect from me.

No matter who you are you're bound to have seen Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney in a movie or two. Both gave their usual performances and they were both a joy to watch. The only actors I was unfamiliar with in the main line-up were Elizabeth Olsen and John Magaro. Olsen was phenomenal, as was her character, and she's definitely one of the most adorable actresses to come out in the last few years. Magaro was equally enjoyable as the psychologically troubled Dean.

As I said already I did enjoy the film's story, but towards the end things got a little `eh'. Throughout the first two-third's of the film the pacing is amazing. So much so that I was surprised an hour had already passed. Once you hit that hour mark, though, things get a little jumbled. I wasn't expecting the relationship with Zibby to take the course it did and the ending felt a little rushed. Liberal Arts definitely could have benefited from another ten or fifteen minutes added to the overall running time. This would have allowed the ending to be fleshed out a little more.

Overall Score: 8.5/10 - To fans of over the top commercial films, Liberal Arts may come off as pretentious. To fans of indie films, Liberal arts may seem a bit cliched. With that said, for me, Liberal Arts was an enjoyable little love story with a great cast. It may not be breaking new ground, but it's definitely something you should try out.",1360800000,,3856,4.436440677966102

He acquits himeslf well and it's hard to find a moviemaker these days willing to deliver this kind of redemptive message.

Plus she overplays the role, behaving more like a fifteen year old than a nineteen year old.

Jesse then travels from NYC to the chillaxed, idyllic Ohio campus. While visiting, Jesse meets Zibby, a 19 year old sophmore who takes an active interest in him. With a few relevant, contributing subplots, this movie is a realistic portrayal of growth for characters both young and old. For a while, in fact, the movie makes you think it's going to go certain places that lots of movies go to for these realizations, but then takes some realistic, morally grounded turns that I appreciated. The acting was really good here, including a noteworthy supporting performance from Zac Efron. The only minor complaint I have, which I didn't actively think about until the movie was over, is that there were a few too many coincidences of characters running into one another.

Movie Review....the movie started out promising. Something lighthearted, not too deep or serious, had some characters that were likable such as the 'wise man in the red hat', characters had some issues that conceivably would be easy for many to relate to, refreshingly not full of foul language or any explicit scenes (in the beginning at least), laugh-out-loud moments, and music that fit the mood of the film. (!!Spoiler Alert!!)....All of this was dampened when the film arrived at the bedroom(s) scene: he won't sleep with Zibby, a young woman of 19/20, because of their age difference and her lack of experience, explaining to her it was based on ""morality"", which he apparently somehow forgot when in the same night, he quickly and easily sleeps with a female professor who is many, many times older than he.
I can understand his refusal in the first instance, after all he truly liked and respected the lovely Zibby, had a good friendship with her that looked like it easily could have turned into a wonderful, long-lasting friendship, and he didn't want to ruin that. But then after speaking of having ""morality"", to immediately turn around and bed an old, bitter, mean, selfish, man-user of a professor (who he had absolutely no friendship with) simply because he liked her romantic literature class she taught and because of some twisted infatuation based on the wrong assumption that she would be 'romantic' because of the class she taught, well it seemed hypocritical, far-fetched, unbelievable, unnecessary, and just plain gross. It actually made me dislike his character, and consequently the film too.
Had the movie cut out that bar/bedroom scene with the female professor, it would have been a good film, and would have still made all of the meaningful points it was trying so hard to portray with that one horrid scene.",1358985600,2,1934,4.9907120743034055

5217809,4,B0090SI3HU,"Josh Radnor wrote, directed and has the lead in this seemingly personal story of a guy in his mid-30's returning to his small liberal arts college in central Ohio.  This at the request of one of his favorite and now retiring teachers (Richard Jenkins).  Jesse (Radnor) is a college admissions officer in New York City whose romantic (marriage?) relationship had just ended.  Feeling somewhat depressed by his crummy job and lack of a social life, he agrees to speak for Prof. Holberg at his retirement party.

While having dinner with Hoberg, he meets a couple and their 19 year old daughter Elizabeth (Zibby) played with her usual acumen by Elizabeth Olsen.  They are close friends of the professor and their daughter goes to the same unnamed college.  Jesse and Zibby immediately hit it off, especially when it comes to books and authors, well at least until Zibby confesses to being fond of a certain series of novels revolving around a human girl and her affection for a young vampire.

Jesse returns to his moribund life but can't get Zibby (he insists on calling her Elizabeth) off his mind, nor she him.  They write each other, send music mixes and talk on the phone.  Jesse finds excuses to return more than once but when Zibby wants to take the relationship to the next level, Jesse balks due to their age difference.  Radnor doesn't break any new ground here but as usual Ms. Olsen breathes life into her character and overcomes the sometimes dour feel of the movie.

Jenkins character is an interesting diversion as he reconsiders his retirement.  Allison Janney plays another former teacher of Jesse's which adds another age appropriate relationship question.  This is another one of those small personal stories that provides film comfort food but will have you looking for something else soon after.  Enjoy.

The Blu ray version of the film conveys its digitally shot image to a 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks very good with adequate sharpness and clarity.  There are no imagery issuees.  The color is strong and vibrant.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  As the movie is dialog centric we don't get much from the surrounds.

It is true that it is probably more relevant for those people over thirty who have ""been there and done that,"" but it's a good thing to think about for the younger crowd. It's a film about trying to find one's place in life at any age. I am in my sixties, but I had the same feelings at 19 as the 19 year old, the same feelings at 35 as Jesse, and the same feelings in my sixties as the 60 year old. I just wish I had known what Jesse found out at age 35 when I was 19. I also liked the fact that the film showed that no matter what your age is you can still have meaningful relationships with those who are younger and older. I am a professional who has 20-something aged children, and I am friends with their friends. I am friends with my contemporaries, and I take care of elderly people, with whom I am also friends.

5217981,1,B0090SI3HU,"Simply put, the movie is poorly written, and that's where all the problems come from.  There is no real conflict at any point in the film, and the characters drift between indie-rom-com set pieces until the end.  The writer/director/leading man and a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' (if you don't know what it is, Google it.  Pretty much it's a shallow and underdeveloped female character who is inexplicably attracted to the typically reserved male protagonist, and she 'brings him out of his shell' and 'teaches him how to live life.)

The characters don't develop at all really.  Jesse is a wimp and a loser throughout the film, and he shows no real development until he finally asks a girl out at the end.  (But this isn't development because in the beginning we see he's had an established relationship, and he had no trouble asking out the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.)

There are no stakes.  Nothing is at risk.  The best scene takes place with his former college professor, and the only reason it's good is because it's ripped straight out of *The Graduate.*

In fact, the entire film could be seen as a vastly inferior remake of *The Graduate.*  (A college grad comes back to his home town/college, meets a younger girl still in college, has a fling with an older woman from his past, obsesses about what he's going to do with his life, etc.)

The characters just sit around.  Almost every scene of dialogue is just the characters sitting next to or across from each other.  It's not interesting to watch, and shows that Radnor needs to improve his directing.

It was the type of movie that makes you think about the various choices that we have in life, and how difficult it is to always make the right one. It's the story of Jesse, an admissions director at a NYC college, who's lost his zest for life. When asked by a former college teacher to attend his retirement dinner, Jesse heads out to Ohio and confronts a number of individuals who change his life forever. Jesse, who's an avid reader, mingles with one of his past professors, but also ends up meeting and getting into a pretty serious relationship with a 19 year old student, Ziggy. Jesse ends up questioning his every move, but fortunately thinks things through before making any mistakes that would have been detrimental to his life. In the end, it's a movie about salvation and how by being honest with yourself and others, you're drawn naturally toward making the right decisions. This was a feel good movie that makes you think about your life. Through the various interactions that Jesse has with the people that he meets, he goes from being bored and dispassionate, to finally coming to terms with his decisions and having new direction and purpose to his life. By doing so, he once again lives a passionate life and all ends on a happy note.

5218064,3,B0090SI3HU,"""How I Met Your Mother"" star Josh Radnor's second film as writer-director is a genial tale of a New York City college admissions officer asked by one of his former professors (Richard Jenkins) to return to their idyllic Ohio college to pay tribute to his retiring teacher. There, he's infatuated with Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen), the 19-year-old daughter of Jenkins' friends, who's currently enrolled on campus. Radnor is likeable as the 35-year-old trying to settle down but navigating rocky relationships in order to get there; his movie is a bit rough around the edges but has plenty of perceptive dialogue and amiable performances, making ""Liberal Arts"" worth seeing (Zac Efron also makes an unbilled appearance).

Here in ""Liberal Arts"" Radnor wrote, directed and stars in the film.  Judging from the quick synopsis that I read before seeing the movie, I was expecting a bit more of a romantic comedy but was pleasantly surprised to find a film with a little more heart and soul to it.

Josh Radnor plays Jesse Fisher, a 35 year old New York college admissions officer who, fresh off a break-up, jumps at a chance to return to his alma mater in Ohio for a retirement dinner for one of his favorite professors.  There he is introduced to 19 year old Zibby, played by Elizabeth Olsen, who is passionate about improv, classical music and reading.  The two connect over their love of reading, and as Radnor heads back to New York Zibby gives him a mix CD of her favorite classical music in order to broaden his playlist beyond unknown Indie bands.  She writes her phone number in the CD case, but tells Jesse how much she loves the handwritten word so the two start exchanging letters discussing the music.

It is through those letters that their relationship builds.  It is interesting that this simple act of exchanging handwritten letters really does change your perception of the relationship.  There is just something so much more personal, so much more romantic when pen is put to paper.  We are living in a society where text messages and Tweets are the preferred method of communication so it was refreshing to see two people communicating through long, thought-out letters.

In one of those letters Zibby invites Jesse to come back and see her.  It is then where things start to get interesting as it was easy enough for Jesse to not define his relationship with the young coed through their written correspondence, the case could still be made for them just being friends, or kindred spirits or even that Jesse was just a mentor to young Zibby.  To say much more might spoil the movie.

I thought that the movie dealt with the process of growing up in a poignant way.  When Jesse's old professor lets him in on the dirty little secret that nobody really feels like an adult, that we all mostly feel 19 years old even as we age well past that number.  I think that really hit the mark here as Jesse decides the path he should take with Zibby and his life in general.

This is not your typical romantic comedy, it is more a story of finding the path that you are meant to be on and how it is sometimes much easier to retreat and find yourself back on familiar ground.  It is a quiet little movie filled with characters that you can relate to and characters that you care about.  I would highly recommend seeing it!",1356825600,,2918,4.776892430278885

5218164,4,B0090SI3HU,"Though I didn't fall in love with Happythankyoumoreplease, I think Josh Radnor has a lot to add in the world of modern film. He, like John Cusack, has an admirable everyman quality and the fact that he writes and directs, brings an auteur like approach to his cinematic presence.

Firstly, I enjoyed this movie despite what I felt were some of the film's flaws (which I'll get to shortly). Josh plays Jesse, a wider-eyed but more down-to-earth, bearded romantic version of his Ted Mosby character on How I Met Your Mother. He lives in New York City, the greatest city in the world, a place where his laundry is stolen in the first ten minutes of the film by a chubby kid. He is recently dumped and yet still, he forges on, happy to get a call from a former professor, Peter Hoberg (Jenkins). Hoberg is having a quasi-retirement party and wants Jesse up there in Ohio as a guest.

Not long after his bucolic drive through the Arcadian countryside of Ohio (a nice contrast to the drab and dour apartment and city scenes in New York), Jesse finds myself back in his favourite professor's presence. Through Hoberg, he meets friends of the said professor and their precocious, equally wide-eyed daughter, Zibby (Olsen), a theatre student with a love of improv. Though the retirement dinner isn't the most exciting, Jesse finds himself on nostalgia lane, wandering the campus at night, bumping into Nat (Zac Efron). Nat is somewhere between a stoner and a Zen Master sage, a bit of a trickers and urges Jesse to follow him. Nat hears music. Let's go check it out. Jesse doesn't want to but Nat convinces him to be adventurous.

At the party, coincidentally and pleasantly, Zibby bumps into Jesse.

From there, the relationship blossoms, in montages of campus walking scenes and then through letters. Zibby introduces Jesse to classical music and through various montages of New York, Radnor has Jesse walking the street, ear-budded, listening to the likes of Mozart's 'Cosi Fan Tutti' and Beethoven's Pastoral, not to forget Massenet's 'Meditation' from the opera Thais.

Of course, crunch time has to come because Jesse isn't nineteen and Zibby is certainly not thirty-five and though they've been writing letters, epistles does not a romantic-comedy, let a lone dramedy make.

Again, I really enjoyed this film but I found the dramatic moments added little weight or substance to the film. For instance (my first flaw): Hoberg's attempt to get out of retirement struck me as a bit pathetic and out of character. There was a kind of mean-spirited desperation to his argument with the head of the department. I found this a bit distracting and though it tried to balance the love-interest going on between Zibby and Jesse, I didn't find it necessary and more off-putting.

Moreover, Dean (Magaro), the depressed college student, a closet-bibiophile who is more Holden Caufield than anything, suffers in this film without being offered a solution by the film's end (my second flaw). Dean's presence grounded this film during the time when the precarious love story got off the ground and instead of focusing on Hoberg, I wish Radnor had explored more of Dean. The depression is deeper and can't be solved with anti-depressant drugs and a pep talk by film's end (doing my best to avoid spoiling anything). I related to Dean the most because I was very similar to him, longing for university to be just over. He was a fascinating character and had something to offer.

Returning to Zibby and Jesse, the relationship of course has to either blossom or die and it's up to the viewer to find out what happens.

Allison Janney playing a now-cold-hearted but still revered English Romantic professor was perfect in her role and could have been the character to best show the soullessness and bureaucratic nonsense of being a tenured professor. Janney's presence was enough in this regard. Having her preach the message of being anti-faculty meetings and politics, this would have opened up possibilities for the script to focus on Dean and give his character some hope as opposed to giving him the Sitcom, Full-House-esque-we're-getting-near-the-credits advice.

Still, I'll watch this movie again. It's definitely better than the latest bland, rom-coms without their challenging narrative arcs. Also nice to see Zac Efron do something a bit more looney, less romantic. Though, despite the chemistry of the leads and some rather honest depictions of university life, I didn't think Radnor truly challenged the viewer the way excellent cinema does. I do have a feeling he is on the way and he needs to distance himself from his Ted Mosby persona. This is a fun movie, a great movie at times and definitely one I'll watch again because despite my criticism, Liberal Arts embraces an intelligent audience without being pretentious or annoyingly esoteric.",1355788800,2,4837,4.9604938271604935
5218165,3,B0090SI3HU,"This lightweight 2012 dramedy marks the sophomore effort of screenwriter/director Josh Radnor who is better known as being part of the ensemble of the long-running CBS sitcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-I-Met-Your-Mother/dp/B003L77G6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How I Met Your Mother</a>.

He cast himself as Jesse Fisher, a 35-year-old admissions counselor who leaves New York to visit his bucolic alma mater in Ohio to attend the retirement party for Peter Hoberg, one of his favorite professors. In a decidedly nostalgic mood, Jesse strikes up a platonic relationship with Zibby, a 19-year-old sophomore who appreciates classical music, loves her improv class, and unapologetically enjoys vampire romance novels. Radnor deftly wraps his story in the romance of academia and cultural discernment at the same time showing his character's discontent about growing old without fulfilling the dreams he held in his youth on the same campus.

Radnor must think Jesse's discontent is endemic since he also shows Hoberg grappling with post-retirement life as well as the harsh cynicism of Judith Fairfield, a Romantics professor who reveals herself as a cougar holding no sentiment about former students who worshipped her in the classroom. There's also sad-eyed Dean, a suicidal student whom Jesse sees as a kindred spirit, and a new-age eccentric named Nat who pops up now and then to tell Jesse to go with the flow. Meanwhile, the courtship between Jesse and Zibby is handled with chaste affection until they face the inevitable moment when they face what their relationship is about. Radnor is amiable as the sometimes condescending Jesse, but his puppyish manner doesn't leave an indelible impression. He got lucky with the superb actors he was able to secure. Richard Jenkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor/dp/B001N406EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor</a>) plays Hoberg with fierce pride and vulnerability, expertly handling a scene where the humiliated professor asks for his job back.

She brings a smart, zestful quality that helps the film glide over its potentially more unsavory moments. John Magaro plays Dean close to the vest since the part appears ill-defined, while Zac Efron is merely distracting playing strictly against type as Nat. Playing what amounts to a convenient plot device, Elizabeth Reaser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Land-A-Love-Story/dp/B000P5FH26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Land - A Love Story</a>) has a few brief scenes as an age-appropriate bookstore clerk back in New York.

5218166,4,B0090SI3HU,"If you are looking at the Amazon page of ""Liberal Arts"", maybe you heard that this is a little indie movie about a thirty-something guy striking up a relationship with a college student. At least, that is what I thought went I went to see this movie in the theatre this weekend. Boy, was I in for a surprise!

""Liberal Arts"" (2012 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Jesse Fisher (played by Josh Radnor), a 35 yr. old college admission officer at some school in New York. One day he gets a call from a retiring professor at his alma mater in Ohio, and Jesse agrees to come for the farewell dinner. While spending the weekend there, Jesse gets to meet Zibby (played by Elizabeth Olsen), a 19 yr. old sophomore, and wouldn't you know it, they hit it off. Soon Jesse returns to NY, but Jesse and Zibby start a penpal relationship the old fashioned way, by actually handwriting letters to each other. There are a number of secondary characters in the movie that are of some interest, none more than the retiring professor (played by Richard Jenkins), who may be regretting his decision; then there is Nate (played by Zac Efron), in a very small role as a non-student college hanger-on with some unique views of the world. At some point Zibby invites Jesse to return for a weekend. Will Jesse and Zibby become romatically involved? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. But I dare say that you will be surprised. That aside, Elizabeth Olsen continues her winning ways (check out last year's ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"").

This movie may be marketed as a ""romantic comedy"" but it is so much more than that. In the second half of the movie, Jesse reflects on the age difference with Zibby, while Peter (the retiring professor) reflects on the life that has passed him by. There are a number of scenes involving the topic of ageing (Peter reflects ""the dirty little secret is that nobody views themselves as an adult"") that really spoke to me. This movie must be a labor of love for Josh Radnor, who not only stars in it but also wrote and directed it. By the way, the Ohio scenes were shot in and around Kenyon College here in Ohio. In all, this movie was quite the unexpected but nice surprise for me. If you are in the mood for a quality indie movie, ""Liberal Arts"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1351900800,5,2358,4.494172494172494

Usually, if I see a movie in the theater, I don't get the DVD, but I will buy this one.

Unlike most American movies - even indy's these days - this is a movie that respects its screenwriter. As a result, in plot and dialogue, it is like many foreign movies: designed for serious minded people, grown-ups, which is appropriate for a movie about growing up (no matter how old you are) and the limits of intellect without character. It is hard for me to define the ideas of the movies without making it sound dull, but it is also extraordinarily funny. Even now, 24 hours after I saw the movie, lines of dialogue or certain scenes keep coming back to me, alternately making me laugh or ponder the wisdom of the film, from the hilariously unromantic date with an inspired professor of romantic literature to the trenchant observation that ""guilt before you act is morality,"" this will be a movie I will want to watch many times.",1348963200,22,1249,4.478070175438597
8533491,3,B0090SI3HU,"First of all, Elizabeth Olsen was superb.  Every line was delivered with pure genuineness and casual confidence.  Wow!  Josh Rogan was also good, but he had a difficult task in front of him.  He had to pretend to be a hesitant 35 year old in the face of a romance with a beautiful 19 year old, which is pure fiction.  In fact, the writing that made the 19 year old the one who initiated their romance (hugs, sex, etc.) with the 35 year old is utterly ludicrous.  The writers were trying to make the 35 year old look more redeeming by being hesitantly suggested/pressured into a romance with a younger woman, but that was just so implausible.  Men simply don't do that and neither do 19 year old initiate so much.  So the movie plot was so unrealistic that the good acting could not shine as much as it should have.

As a side note, the element about futility and arrogance of the 35 year olds views on his taste being superior was well done.  It artfully showed how believing ones own tastes to be superior to someone else's is grossly incorrect and immature, which was intentionally done to portray him as emotionally stunted, but it was still a very valuable point to make.",1529193600,,1175,4.4485981308411215

The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to Jesse so much.  And I'm not sure what people's problem is with the relationship between him and Zibby, because I think most people are just looking for a connection with a kindred spirit in this life and some can have a hard time finding it and become ""desperate"" (been there).  The interesting thing is, despite me being much older and male, I probably related to Zibby at least as much as I related to Jesse (sue me, haha).  Especially when it came to her feelings concerning her romantic feelings for Jesse.  Just about everything she said to him in that one climatic scene, I predicted what she'd say before she said it, because I was thinking the same thing.  Love when you have that kind of telepathy with a character.

If I'd been Jesse, I know I'd have been flattered to have someone like Zibby interested in me in that way.  I honestly do think (though there's always exceptions) people make way too big a deal about age differences.  Maybe just the romantic idealist in me (shame most people seem to lose that when they ""grow up""), but if you can make a connection with a kindred spirit in this world, what's the problem?  It doesn't always even have to be about sex at all anyway.  And I did think Jesse could be a bit of a snob regarding Zibby's interests.  So maybe he wasn't as young at heart as he thought?  And maybe I actually am? :)

Anyway, I love Radnor's 2 films he's directed and starred in so much.  So full of heart, optimism, and humanity.  Just wish he'd make more.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,2587,4.502145922746781

Liberal Arts was written and directed by Josh Radnor, primarily known for his role on the CBS TV sitcom How I Met Your Mother. Radnor's protagonist here is Jesse Fischer, a 35 year old college admissions officer at an unnamed NYC institution of higher learning, presumably NYU.

Radnor goes very light on Jesse's backstory, only cluing us in that he's dissatisfied with his job (the opening sequence features Jesse speaking to a coterie of unseen students about the pitfalls of the admission process) and that he's in the last throes of an unsatisfying relationship with a girlfriend.

The inciting incident occurs when Jesse receives a call from his former English professor, Peter Holberg (Richard Jenkins), who invites him up to his Alma mater to attend the professor's retirement ceremony. Jesse drives up to the school (the scenes were filmed at Radnor's Alma mater, Kenyon College) in Ohio. At this point you might likely presume that Radnor's protagonist is based on autobiographical material.

The principal thrust of the story concerns Jesse's relationship with Zibby, a 19 year old student at the school and daughter of Professor Holberg's friends played by a miscast Elizabeth Olsen--who was 23 during filming and looking much more mature than a co-ed in her sophomore year. After initially meeting, the two, both literature mavens, agree to correspond through regular snail mail. In a series of montages and voice overs, Zibby clues Jesse into the wonders of classical music (for some reason while growing up Jesse never became familiar with any well known classical composers), and he ends up traipsing about NYC enraptured with familiar sites while listening to noted classical music compositions on his headphones.

Eventually the mismatched couple have a disagreement over taste in literature: Jesse feels Zibby is wasting her time indulging her inner aesthete by embracing a ""Twilight-like"" vampire trilogy; Zibby on the other hand makes no bones about enjoying such mindless but entertaining ""literature."" The dark moment at the end of the Second Act occurs when the earnest Jesse refuses to sleep with Zibby, who reveals she is a virgin.

Radnor injects a series of secondary characters and subplots to perhaps spice things up a bit considering how thin his main plot between Jesse and Zibby turns out to be. Jesse meets Nat (Zac Efron) a non-student hipster who teaches Jesse how to loosen up. And then there's Dean (John Magaro), a depressed, bipolar student who Jesse saves from killing himself, after he ingests a gaggle of unidentified pills. Finally, there's Professor Judith Fairchild, who Jesse reveres as his number one professor, from his heady days as an undergraduate. Fairchild invites Jesse back for a one-night stand but cynically kicks him out of her home afterward, deriding him for not being manly enough and as world- weary as she.

Somehow Radnor would like us to be impressed with Jesse's ""growth,"" although it's difficult to perceive such progress when we learn so little about his protagonist in the first place. As it turns out, Jesse at film's end meets another woman, Ana (Elizabeth Reaser), a bookstore employee and lover of books (just like Jesse), and they walk into the sunset happily ever after (Ana is strictly there as Jesse's love interest with little to no character development).

In the end, the nature of Radnor's vanity project becomes clear. Jesse really was a mensch all along, only peripherally led off course by the allure of a nubile 19 year old co-ed. The earnest Jesse rejects having ""casual"" sex which would of course have dire consequences for the perky but immature Zibby. Throw in playing the mentor to the confused Dean, a buddy to the semi-zany Nat and a disillusioned but now world wise ""Benjamin"" to Professor Fairchild's ""Mrs. Robinson,"" and one is left with another typical indie replete with the obligatory glacial pacing and comatose narrative.",1482624000,,3986,5.091883614088821
8533499,5,B0090SI3HU,"I really liked this story of a guy (played by Josh Radnor) who loved his college experience, he was still stuck in the academia mindset, and relished his invitation to go back to the campus to attend the retirement party of one of his favorite professors. While there he becomes friends with a student (16 years his junior) and debates whether to take it beyond friendship. My favorite part is when he gets back to New York and narrates a letter he sent her giving her his mobile experiences while listing to the classical music CD mix she gave him. Those narrative scenes scored with the music excerpts from the CD were very good. I didn't recognize Zac Efron as the guy playing the crazy campus hippie until I read it in one of these reviews. Didn't really get that casting decision or his desire to play the part unless it was to show his acting skill beyond the stereotype hunky, sexy leading man. The sub-plot of the Josh Radnor character, who loved college, helping a bi-polar genius student who hates it to the point of attempted suicide, was a nice touch.",1468022400,,1063,4.541666666666667

I found it to be so unrealistic and the characters so unlikable that I forced myself to view it to the end and that was a chore in of itself. I guess its the artistic, romantic version of modern romance that the filmmaker was aiming for. There wasn't one character that I liked or could even relate to. The majority of them were self-indulgent, narcissistic, judgemental and simply downright miserable. Whats even worse the characters weren't even true to their own selves..Pathetically unrealistic

Essentially this was a millennial mid-life crisis......Lordy",1466208000,,711,5.076923076923077
