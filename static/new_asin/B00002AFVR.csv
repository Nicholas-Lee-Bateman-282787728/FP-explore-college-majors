7943623,5,B00002AFVR,"Today in Washington D.C., in glass cases behind panes of special glass to protect them from the light, are two handwritten documents getting along in years. Their words are dim, hard to make out, but not their meaning--- Liberty, Freedom. and rights for the individual few other countries have ever granted their people.
""The colonies are not to be emancipated from their dependence on the supremacy of England,"" said King George III, but Jefferson, Adams, Franklin and other patriot leaders couldn't picture a brand new Republc being led by someone 3000 miles away. George Washington's leadership was what America needed.
He served two terms as President, then voluntarily gave up his power setting a precedent that lasted until the 1940s. King George III couldn't believe it. But King George couldn't believe Americans needed to chart their own course.
He went mad, you know. Absolutely mad. Had to be kept in a straightjacket there for awhile.",1354060800,,946,5.109677419354838
7943624,4,B00002AFVR,"This documentary is a solid intro to U.S. Constitution. It is mostly about basic facts, and as such is aimed at a high school audience. There is little nuanced analysis of various Constitutional provisions. Its basic mission is to introduce the viewer to the Constitution, or to make sure that one remembers basic facts about it, if one has to take a relevant exam. If you teach a college course in American politics, as I do, then this video can be useful as a refresher on what the Constitution actually says. I am not a constitutional law expert, and the U.S. Constitution per se takes up one week of a sixteen week course, so I never explore the document in-depth. These tapes remind me of the basics, the foundation--and without such foundation the beautiful edifice of more elaborate knowledge cannot stand.",1028332800,,813,4.773049645390071
7943625,5,B00002AFVR,"This is an excellent synopsis of the uniqueness, magnitude and importance of the U.S. Constitution.  Taking the viewer through each Article and Amendment, these videos clearly and easily explain why the Framers found it  important to separate and limit the powers of government and what each  branch of government is responsible for providing to the American people.  The controversy over state versus federal rights and individual protection  from the government is also well presented.  Filled with great  pictures and footage, the Constitution and its amendments are outlined with  the added comments of two articulate and insightful professors.  The videos  are easy to follow and lend themselves well to student note-taking.  These  are a definite asset to any government teacher's video library.",956102400,,801,5.528925619834711
