3119505,5,B0013UNBOS,"I must say that this is the best African Dance workout I have ever done off of a DVD. I took African dance classes at a studio in Boston, and also as part of my high school's dance team. This video really made me feel like I was back in a dance studio. The dance is fast paced, fun, and will definitely get your heart rate up! What I really like about this video is that the dancing DOES NOT STOP. I hate workout videos where the instructor pauses endlessly for explanation. Debra talks while you're moving and you get the full 40 minutes of dancing. I'm not sure I would recommend this for total beginners, but it's fun, fun, fun!!",1339372800,14,632,4.231404958677686
3119506,5,B0013UNBOS,"Wow!!  I absolutely love this DVD/Workout. I have been trying to find an exercise routine that keeps me wanting more and more and Eureka!!  I have finally done just that. Debra is so lively and just makes you want to get every single step...  The energy is AWESOME and you feel your metabolism rise immediately no matte how ""in shape"" you may think you are. My maximum calorie burn was 742 doing 46 minutes and the warm up and I rested a few times during the routine..  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good cardio workout, loves a motivating instructor with loads of energy and loves dancing!!  Oh not to mention the beats are incredible!!",1331164800,9,652,4.491525423728813
3119507,4,B0013UNBOS,"So it's slightly cheesy, but Debra is great, she is very encouraging and if you push yourself you can really get your heart rate up. Plus its fun and goes by fast!",1305072000,5,163,4.125
3119508,4,B0013UNBOS,"I don't know if I would call this an intermediate video.  None of the moves are that difficult, just energetic.

I cant say I was really feeling the music. kind of disney lionking. but I killed the audio and put on some of my fav music.  so no problem.

I'm more of a dancer than a workout guy.  So I was slightly disappointed that the video has more of a workout emphasis.  the moves are toned down, abbreviated, streamlined.  A dancer can still pick up some root movements, and learn to shift body weight and etc.  but you have to add your own style (i recommend youtube for peeking more stylized dance versions of the steps).  But again, thats my own taste rather than a problem with the vid.

Overall, I really like this video.",1216771200,25,731,4.348148148148148
3119509,5,B0013UNBOS,"This is my second Debra Bono DVD and so far my favorite!  This DVD starts with 7 minute warm up that includes some of the movements that you will be doing during the aerobic section and then a light stretch for muscles.
The 40 minute aerobic section consist of two different workouts.  If you (like me) have a very extensive home DVD library and look for DVD's to create a little variety and also muscle confusion this is it!  I love doing the moves that swing your leg in circle (while standing) or work your shoulder forward in a lunge, or even a kick back with attidude.  The dance is well cued, the studio is beautiful and the music is perfect for the dancers.  This is advertised as an intermediate DVD and I would say that's about right, although advanced beginners may want to give it a try only because the workout is so interesting, you would not mind practing with it a few times.
There are plenty of hops for those of you who like high impact, but there is also a modifier in the back (sometimes hard to see) who does a low impact version.
I also like this one more than the other that I purchased because there is no down time.  No stopping for creative moves..just full aerobic dance...and the dance is fun and beautiful.
If you want to try a workout that is differnt than what you have (march, march, side step, side step) this is it.  I will use this DVD frequently and keep it in my library.",1212624000,50,1407,4.306818181818182
3119510,5,B0013UNBOS,IT WAS A GIFT,1433462400,,13,2.5
3119511,5,B0013UNBOS,"I bought this hoping to find something different so that I can stop being bored with the same old same old. This workout delivers. It's definitely high energy so it is more for intermediate. The steps are easy so good for dance challenged people like myself. I get a good sweat trying to keep up with her. It's very fast moving. Some moves are done once in a set so you need to pay attention. What I like are when she's quiet and you have to remember the moves, although she does cue a bit with her hands. Overall, I'm very happy with this.",1428796800,,540,4.201923076923077
3119512,5,B0013UNBOS,"I love this DVD! Ms. Debra gives perfectly timed instructions and the movements progress at just the right pace. If you fully engage, you will definitely get a great workout. I love African dance but it's been ages since I've been able to attend a class. Fortunately Debra Bono is right here in my living room. No embarrassment. No judgement. Just powerful, creative African movement. Love!!!",1427068800,,392,4.954545454545454
3119513,5,B0013UNBOS,Great video!,1426550400,,12,5.5
3119514,5,B0013UNBOS,OMG!  Great workout!  Its fun and a very fast workout.... You look up and complete 45 mins of dance ;-),1425772800,,103,4.1
3119515,4,B0013UNBOS,This is a great workout dvd for beginner and intermediate exercisers/dancers. You will definitely work up a sweat.,1424822400,,114,5.388888888888889
3119516,5,B0013UNBOS,"Awesome, will make you sweat!",1423440000,,29,5.0
3119517,5,B0013UNBOS,"This video is loads of fun. It's energetic, varied and provides a good workout about 50 minutes long. It includes a warmup followed by two dance routines that Debra teaches incrementally followed by a short cool down. If you want shorter workouts, you could easily just do one of the dances. If you need to be able to do it perfectly the first time, this video probably not for you. It's a little confusing at first. With each repetition, it gets a little easier to follow. The challenge of getting better at the dances as you go is what makes it fun for me. It's a little high impact with a lot of bouncing and hopping, but it is easily modifiable if you have foot or knee problems or are just not feeling right one day. There are three demonstrators and one or two of them are demonstrating modifications that Debra points out occasionally. There are a few times where the leader flubs the cues ""left, I mean, right"" or once where she calls something a ""combo"" and then says it's a ""repeater"" because it ""three,"" but it actually is a combo. A little distracting, but not a big deal. Generally, the leaders cues and demonstrations are easy to follow. She teaches a step with lots of repetitions, and adds it to the routine so it's easy to learn. The DVD includes a short set of upper body exercises at the end that seem out of place, but easy to skip. It uses weights and a step. I do the upper body occasionally and it feels good. Her guidance on the weights seems good and safe.",1422662400,,1481,4.369565217391305
3119518,3,B0013UNBOS,I found this video to be fun however about half way through I completely gave up the moves became to difficult and I was exhausted...I think if someone sticks with it tho they will be in great shape!,1422057600,,199,4.2631578947368425
3119519,4,B0013UNBOS,"It doesn't feel like a work out at first because the instructors energy is pretty ""low key"" compared to other dance dvd's, but you'll be tired before you know it.",1417392000,,162,4.433333333333334
3119520,5,B0013UNBOS,"I took African dance several years ago from a performance troop from Senegal.  It was very difficult and the teachers didn't speak English which made it fun.  I usually ended each class lying on the floor being laughed at.  I really enjoyed it.

 I almost didn't get this DVD due to some negative reviews.  There was a complaint about the music. My opinion: The drums are great just what is appropriate for African dance.  The other complaint was about it being simple and not like dance.  I'm confused about that.  It's what you put into it.  With each step, even side to side, she demonstrates a constant head and torso movement along with a bounce.  If you're not doing that then it would just seem like stepping.  I can see the multiple levels of exertion.  The more you do the better the workout.  The dance moves I learned years ago, I saw the Senegalese perform for an audience.  They performed some of these moves in the air.  How much can you bend, how high can you jump?  Though I doubt I can ever become aloft, I'm sure I've got a lot of energy to put into this before I ever get bored.  I have to say that I love the syncopation of African drums which are very different from the marching style of Anglo drums.",1414022400,,1222,4.355555555555555
3119521,5,B0013UNBOS,"This video is great. I had low expectations because it's a bit low budget but the instructor is amazing - really clear and easy to follow. It's not easy, though - it's definitely a serious workout, but it's very fun.",1401062400,,216,4.425
3119522,5,B0013UNBOS,"to be honest i have back issues but always wanted to see how they dance the african way,if you want to lose you will with this dvd just watching them i was tired...lol :)",1389225600,,170,4.029411764705882
3119523,4,B0013UNBOS,I like the African Dance Workout! The dances are a little hard to follow but with practice it will become perfect!,1384560000,,114,4.476190476190476
3119524,5,B0013UNBOS,"Good workout. The instructor is charming and engaging. The dance routine is fun to do. It's long, but the instructor breaks it into easy-to-chew bits. Of course, you can only do parts of the routine at a time if you want. I enjoy workout out with Debra Bono on this video. I'll look for more of her work.",1384041600,,304,4.258620689655173
3119525,3,B0013UNBOS,When you can remember all the steps it's nice but there are so many that it's difficult to keep up with the instructor.  Moves a bit too fast for a beginner.,1370476800,,157,4.064516129032258
3119526,5,B0013UNBOS,"Debra Bono rocks! I have wasted money on so many workout routines (VHS/DVD) in which the instructor goes too fast, is boring, or tells you to do something that can only be seen by the person operating the camera or there in the room! This DVD is absolutely great. Not only does Debra Bono explain every step ahead of time, constantly keeping you in the loop, but she makes the routines fun! Compare the faces of the people working out with her to other DVDs you've seen...many times the people in back of the instructor are miserable, but all the people dancing with Debra Bono are smiling because they are having fun as well! I'm so happy that I bought this and will be using it regularly.",1370304000,,690,4.440944881889764
3119527,5,B0013UNBOS,"I thoroughly enjoy this video! After taking Zumba (because I love to dance) and feeling like I wasn't getting enough out of the workout (it didn't make me feel like I wanted to repeat the experience), I went investigating dance workouts. I remembered that I have found African dance very invigorating and soul-awakening in my past, so I decided to look for an African dance-based workout. I found Ms. Bono's videos, and to my delight, I wasn't disappointed...it was wonderful! So if you're tired of the ""artificial and commercial buzz"" from Zumba, you should try reawakening that spark you had for dance by getting this video! Thank you, Debra!",1363564800,,644,4.91743119266055
3119528,5,B0013UNBOS,"This is absolutely one of the best aerobic dance DVD's I own. I just purchased it and did it this morning and it was face paced, easy to follow, energetic, fun and went fast. This is one I will go back to over and over and am looking forward to getting the moves down more than first time try. What I like about Debra Bono is she does not dawdle; she explains the moves clearly and I can follow her but she moves through them quickly so the explanations blend into the overall workout. Some DVD dance workouts takes a long time for the explanations in the middle of the workout so once you learn them fairly well, it slows you down when you go back to it. This is not the case with Ms. Bono. She's awesome. It's awesome. I would go to her classes if I lived where she does but I don't because I live in remote Alaska. So, Ms. Bono, if you are reading this, thank you for such a fun and energy driven DVD. I love it. You're the best.",1354233600,5,932,4.043243243243243
3119529,5,B0013UNBOS,"Wow! This thing goes by very fast and I am apparently too slow to keep up!! LOL...Well, today was my first time so hopefully I will eventually catch up!! I had a lot of fun doing this and Debra Bono is a joy!! The moves were fun (although I felt a bit stupid having a little trouble catching on..LOL) and different from what I usually do. I found this to be a great workout...I was so sweaty but felt energized and empowered when I was done!! I highly recommend this workout for anyone who likes to dance, wants to learn to dance, or just wants something different. I like the 5 minute arm workout at the end too!!!

It'd be nice if this had a separate instructional part to learn the moves before dancing, but I think it this was created for VHS originally and transferred to DVD.",1518480000,,303,4.735849056603773
