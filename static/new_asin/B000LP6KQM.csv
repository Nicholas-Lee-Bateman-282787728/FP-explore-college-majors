2711571,5,B000LP6KQM,"I just tried this for the first time yesterday and am feeling the ""good"" sore.  This was a fantastic work out.  It's so hard finding at-home workouts for the intermediate/advanced level, but I would say this is defintiely for the advanced exersizer.

I did not find this as difficult as some of Jari Love's workouts (Get Ripped 1000 and Get Ripped and Chiseled, in particular), however, because of the legnth (about 120 if you do the entire thing) and the number of sets (usually 3 sets of everything), this is still a workout that will be added to my regular rotation.

This requires a lot of equipment: a step, dumbells, bands, body bar, and plate loaded bar.  I do not have a step, body bar or plate loaded bar, but most of the sets that used this equipment was very easy to modify with what I had (plus a ball).  I only had to skip about 2-3 of the exersizes (mostly with the body bar).  Keep in mind, though, the only reason I knew how to modify was because I have been exersizing for a while- Amy does not show modifications with other types of equipment (like Jari Love does), so you're on your own for that.

There are pre-mized NRG workouts, so if you don't have time to do all 120 minutes, you can select to do a shorter workout (ranging from 45 minutes to 80 minutes).  This would be a great time saver, I think.  But don't be afraid of the whole 120 minute workout.  Yes, it's a tough workout, but, unlike any other DVD I've done, about 20% of the time is spent changing out and setting up equipment (for example, adding risers or putting weights aside to grab a band).  This is great because you don't have to rush around or pause the dvd so that you can get things set up for the next set.

Amy is great with cues and explaining correct form and is very motivating.  The music is also great and keeps you moving.  The only thing that could be improved is to show more modifications, as mentioned above. It would also be nice to know how much weight to use for the exersizes.  Amy mentions what she's going to use for some of the sets, but not all.  It would be nice to know if we should go heavy, light, etc. or maybe see what Amy and everyone else in the room is using.

I would definitely recommend this for the serious exersizer.",1217462400,6,2246,4.281990521327014
2711572,3,B000LP6KQM,"I was disappointed with this video for one reason. I purchased it for the adjustable barbell strength training. Amy is featured on the cover with the barbell and has it in with her training equipment during the video, but never once picked it up and used it. I feel the cover should be a reflection of the contents.",1207353600,3,315,4.448275862068965
2711573,4,B000LP6KQM,"This was my first Amy Bento video, and it was a bit different than I thought.  From viewing the clip, I had been expecting a lot of compound moves and thought that the workout would have a functional fitness feel.  This was true a bit, especially with the opening move (see below), but overall, this workout wound up feeling like a shorter, slightly intense version of a Cathe strength workout to me, right down to the use of a lot of equipment (barbell, 2 sets of dumbbells, step, stability ball).

This DVD is well-chaptered; I've listed the chapters below and added my own descriptions after.

Warm-Up.  Includes basic moves such as shrugs, squats, and knee ups.  Ends with a series of stretches held for a nice long, slow 4-count.

Multi-Joint.  This is a compound move:  holding light dumbbells, you  step up with one foot on the step, raise the other knee in the air, and extend that leg twice while doing a front raise.  Amy does several sets on both legs.  She also does a series of squats with lateral side raises that really fried my shoulders!

Legs.  Amy begins with a split lunge with one heel on a small dumbbell (Cathe does this move in Push Pull).  Next comes a barbell squat series which I found very challenging due to the high number of reps:  she does 15 squats in the center, then 8 cursey dips to each side; she repeats the sequence once the same and once with half as many reps.

BIs and TRIs.  Amy does several variations of bicep curls (hammers, center, and concentration) while seated in a v-sit position on the step, so you work your core as well.  Tricep work includes kickbacks and tricep push-ups.

Chest and Back.  Begins with uneven push-ups (one hand on step).  Then, with one hand on the step in a standing position, Amy does a row using arm rotation followed by a lateral raise.  She also does a similar sequence with one hand on the stability ball.

Core Work.  Beginning with your feet on the stability ball, you'll do tough tuck-ins, first just in and out, then bringing your knees from side-to-side--whew!  You'll also place your elbows on the ball and roll them in and out for the core.  Then it's back to a v-sit position on the step for ""sunshines,"" moving the ball in a rainbow overhead, and several quick sets of v-sits in and out to finish.

Cooldown.  Amy offers a nice series of stretches, mainly for the upper body (the lower body is stretched between sets).

Overall, I really enjoyed this workout.  Although Amy worked me hard--especially with that tough squat segment!--because she pauses to stretch between virtually every exercise, I never felt overwhelmed or out of breath.  I also liked how she added in some unique variations on moves and emphasized the core as well.  I'd rate this workout at an intermediate level, and I'd recommend it to someone who likes a bit of variety in their strength routine and prefers a shorter (just  over 39 minutes) full-body workout.",1158019200,9,2922,4.620622568093385
8162849,5,B000LP6KQM,Love this workout.,1410566400,,18,5.333333333333333
8162850,4,B000LP6KQM,"How much longer that this go on? This was my question when I first attempted to do the entire workout without realizing that the workout clocks at more than 2 hrs.... rookie mistake!!!! hahahaha

Anyhow, I love the variety of the premixes and the effort put into the DVD to offer a solid toning/sculpting workout. I like the variety of equipment used, but I would have loved to hear or see alternatives. Not everybody has every single piece of equipment needed, and it is a bummer not to be able to follow along in some cases. I can see this one becoming a go to for overall body sculpting and toning.",1357084800,,601,4.414414414414415
8162851,3,B000LP6KQM,"It's a 45 minute exercise video. Pros - good variety of body pump techniques. Really works out the muscles. Short, sharp and intense. Cons - you need a decent sized exercise room to do this workout. You need the workout weights, the bar, a work-out bench and a medicine ball. How many homes can spare this type of space? Also it can get a little monotonous after a few weeks - doing the same workout day in and day out, unlike a live class where the routines vary and there's interaction. Also it is a 45 minute workout video whereas most pump class I've been to go on for an hour. At the end of the day it depends on what your needs are - if you prefer variety and some interaction with the instructor, then it may help to enrol at a gym instead. If you want a pump work-out at home varied with other types of activites that are more interactive then this should work out okay.",1335052800,,878,4.201183431952662
8162852,3,B000LP6KQM,This workout has a large varitey of weight-lifting moves.  I am an advanced exerciser and found the work-out to be semi-challenging.  I would do this workout on a down-day.,1281398400,,172,4.896551724137931
8162853,5,B000LP6KQM,"This is a 40 minute total body workout and the time just flies!  I was having so much fun; I was disappointed when it was time for the final stretch.  This workout was one of the first one Amy produced and it has stood the test of time.

What I enjoyed about this workout:

**Amy is enthusiastic and encouraging.  She looks like she's having a blast, so I can't help but have fun too.

**The multi-joint warm-up, which comes right after the warm-up.  It's called a warm-up, but you're really diving right into the workout. You're doing delt raises while lunging and then doing a knee lift on the step.  It's tough, works your core and a great warm-up for the rest of the workout.

**The unusual exercises.  I especially liked the ""sunshine"" exercise where you sit on the step, lean back a bit and move a stability ball in an arc.

**The upbeat music.  Amy has a special talent for choosing great workout music.  Its quick beat helps me really push myself.

I would call this an intermediate workout.  However, Amy doesn't give a lot of form pointers, so you need to be aware of good body alignment when doing the exercises.  This is just fine for me, since I don't like to keep hearing form pointers; I'm pretty good at reminding myself.

I would categorize this as more of an endurance workout than a strength building one, since I don't think you're working your muscles enough to get big strength gains.

If you're looking for a workout that will work your entire body, as well as energize you, this may be for you.",1281312000,,1518,4.458181818181818
8162854,5,B000LP6KQM,"It's so hard to find tough, advanced strength training workouts that are also fun.  Amy has produced another winner with her All Pump Extreme workout.  There are over 2 hours of material.  If you're feeling especially brave and strong, you could attempt the whole thing.  There are 8 great premixes, ranging from 45 to 80 minutes as well.

The premixes:

**Total body
**Upper body
**Lower body
**Upper body timesaver
**lower body timesaver
**3 day split - Chest & shoulders
**3 day split - Back, biceps & triceps
**3 day slit - Legs & core.

What I love about this workout:

**the versatility.  I use the 3 day weight split the most often.  I alternate these splits with Amy's Slo Mo Weight workouts for a killer rotation.

**the unique exercises. Amy has a gift for making tough weight training fun.  She also does sets with different counts, e.g. chest presses doing 3 counts down, 1 count up and then doing 1 count down and 3 counts up.

**fun core work.  Amy has a special talent for coming up with different core exercises.

**Amy's enthusiasm.  She loves what she does and it comes through on the DVD.

**Amy tells you what weights she's using.  She also does the equipment changes right on screen with you so you're not scrambling to get set up for the next exercise.

**the great music.  The music has a driving beat and inspires me to crank out that last rep.

Some things to be aware of with this workout:

**this is for the advanced exerciser who has good form and body knowledge.  Amy gives a few form pointers, but she is not constantly reminding you about form.  I like this style, but it is not for everyone.

**you should use lighter weights than you think on some exercises; otherwise you may tweak your back.  This is especially true for the leg routines, e.g. bucket squats, hack squats and curtsy lunges.

**a lot of equipment is used in this workout.  Dumbbells, barbell, body bar, medicine ball, step, tubing and glider discs are used.  If you don't have all that equipment, you should watch the DVD before doing it, so you'll know how to substitute.  This wasn't a problem for me, since I have all of that equipment.  I love using lots of different pieces since it makes the workout more interesting for me.

I highly recommend this workout for advanced exercisers who want to try some fun, new moves.",1280188800,,2324,4.579075425790754
8162855,5,B000LP6KQM,"Amy will lead you through a multi-joint workout for only 40 minutes!  Every traditional move used, Amy comes up with a creative twist to it, so. it isn't the same old move.  For example, bicep curls are done sitting on the step lengthwise as we sit incline.  Her moves are simple and athletic, yet creative.  I like her enthusiasm and this workout is something I go back to because it's not too long and it works the total body.",1263686400,,428,4.379746835443038
8162856,5,B000LP6KQM,"This is a great workout! I love Amy Bento! She's encouraging and fun, but tough as nails! I'm an advanced DVD workout person. That's all I do so I need them to be fun, interesting, and difficult enough to keep me coming back for more. I really loved this one because it's broken up in sections of the body so you can do different sections on different days and mix and match however you choose. Amy looks great and the girls she works with make you feel like you can do it too. I totally recommend this Dvd!",1262736000,,507,4.183673469387755
8162857,5,B000LP6KQM,"This is an intense weight lifting DVD--not for those with weak spirits, but great if you really want a challenge.  I prefer to divid the DVD up amoung 3 days/workouts (1 bi's/tri's, 2 shoulds/chest, 3 legs).  Amy does use a large variety of equiptment, but I found that I could modify any of the moves that I did not have the exact equipment for.  (For example, I do not own a body bar, but used hand weights or my husband's pull up bar that grips onto a door frame instead.  I also do not own a large ""bench press bar,""  but have found ways to modify with hand weights.)  I used to strictly lift weights in a gym weight room, but now I get a much tougher workout w/amy (or Kathy Smith) in my living room!  I am stronger, more toned, and weigh about the same, but am overall smaller and leaner (down a pant size and a bra size).  I find Amy to be a very motivational instructor!",1259280000,,878,4.153846153846154
8162858,5,B000LP6KQM,"As stated below, this workout does use a good bit of equipment.

Body bars, Plate loaded bars, a Step with Risers [Amy uses between 2 and 4 most of the time.  One exercise though (chin-ups) uses 10 risers on either side (20 total) with a body bar on top for the chin up bar - a modifier uses two chairs instead of step riser], two or three sets of dumbbells, and resistance bands.  They also use an optional medicine ball (dumbbell is shown as an option) and Glider Discs for the ab work (They look like Frisbees to me. You place your feet in them to add an unsteadiness to the ab moves which works your core more. - I used tin pie plates instead but I believe the DVD says a folded towel would be a possible substitute).  I do not have a weighted body bar, so I modified with a light amount of weight on a regular bar.

On to the program:

The two hours goes by pretty fast, as you are challenging yourself for the entire program. Every muscle group has a segment featuring multiple exercises that are easy to perform (though some do require setting up your equipment.)  but provide a great burn - my butt really felt it the day after. The DVD calls it ""The Good Sore."" The NRG mixes are a great alternative for the time pressed or for someone who would rather split up the muscle groups they are working over a few days instead of working them all at once.

This became my favorite weight training DVD the first time I did it.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a superior challenge.",1226016000,,1495,4.254416961130742
