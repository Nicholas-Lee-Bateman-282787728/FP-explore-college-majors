2294108,4,B0009J6OQ6,"Raj is supposed to get married and falls in love with the woman that functioned as his matchmaker. She loves him, too, but has a secret that threatens to ruin their new found relationship.

I was rooting for them, too, but until the very end I was not sure how it would turn out, given the strong emphasize on marriage, family and sacrifice.

This is definitely up to par with most of what Hollywood churns out these days. The production values are outstanding and Rai is just gorgeous. This is one of the most, if not the most, beautiful woman on any silver screen. Loved the costumes, the locales... No foul language, absolutely nothing inappropriate is going on (at least that we can see). This is maybe my third ""Bollywood"" movie and I am actually surprised the PTC has not discovered them for family viewing.

Check it out to see if the genre, the subtitles and the long musical interludes are something you can live with. Maybe you'll become a believer. Escapist fare at it's best.",1121558400,4,987,4.596590909090909
8061763,4,B0009J6OQ6,"I'm enjoying Bollywood movies! Never realized they were so colorful and happy.  Oh, and yes, silly.  But i don't mind that. My husband doesn't even mind that! The love stories are compelling and they usually don't even kiss.  How refreshing. I now have 4 and will be ordering more.  Thanks India.",1394323200,,296,4.745098039215686
8061764,5,B0009J6OQ6,"This was one of my first bollywood purchases and it continues to be a favorite.  The story is good, the music is great and the actors shine.  One that I recommend to others who are just coming into bollywood.",1198454400,,208,4.3076923076923075
8061765,3,B0009J6OQ6,"This movie is about Raj (Abhishek Bachan) who lives in New York. Raj's Mom and Mamaji really want him to get married. He takes a trip to India to see his cousin's wedding.  Raj's Mamaji sets up blind dates for him to meet various women.  An assistant of his Mamaji, Namrata (Aishwarya Rai) goes along with Raj on the blind dates.  Raj falls for Namrata.  But Namrata has a past.

There are some definite funny parts - like the blind dates. But there were holes in the story and bad acting in some parts. Arbaaz Khan has absolutely no conviction and his voice sounds emotionless the whole time.  During most of the last half hour, Aishwarya Rai just gapes lifelessly and looks around not knowing what to do. She acts like a doormat but suddenly she gives a speech about a women's status.  Abishek Bachan is ok, he is likeable in the movie and you do get the feeling he really loves Namrata in the movie. Why does Aishwarya Rai dress in ""hip Western clothes"" in the first hour, but suddenly she switches over the saris?  And why does she slap a Sardarji who happens to walk in her direction?  And the obvious Western Union ad and the annoying Coke product placement in the movie gets tiring. The sound track is nice. Most of the movie is fun to watch, but the second half starts to slightly drag because of bad script and acting issues.",1172534400,2,1334,4.412244897959184
8061766,5,B0009J6OQ6,"If anyone feels that Hollywood has forgotten how to make quality films that are pleasant to watch such as the kind that Hollywood used to put out regularly up until the late 60s, then you can feel assured that Bollywood is picking up the slack.

In many ways, this movie reminds me of the films that Doris Day and Rock Hudson put out, like Pillow Talk.  Abhishek Bachchan (Raj) has the suave sophistication of a Cary Grant.  He plays the role of Raj with charm, class, and sophistication.  Aishwarya Rai (Namrata) has the beauty, intelligence, and charm of an Ingrid Bergman.  The woman is multi-talented.  Rai can act, sing, dance, and speak 3-5 language fluently.  You may think these comparisons are a stretch.  Watch this movie and see for yourself.  I'm the biggest fan of both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and these two delightful, Bollywood actors, in my opinion for this particular movie, deserve the comparison.

When was the last time you found a fun, entertaining film for the whole family that could also inspire?  More and more of these little Bollywood gems are coming to light.  Most the world is already more than aware of them.  It's only here in America that we are still a bit in the dark when it comes to International Cinema.

This is a wonderful tale of Raj, who is an Indian man living and working in the United States.  The furthest thing from his mind is settling down and getting married.  His young cousin is getting married in India.  Raj knows better than to attend, because he knows that his Uncle will have a line of potential brides lined up for him a mile long!  Nikki, his cousin, brilliantly schemes a way to get him there as she bawls to him on the phone that she needs his help to break up the marriage because she doesn't love the guy.  It isn't true, of course, which leads to some hilarious misunderstandings when Raj does go and tries to find an excuse to break up the marriage.

In his attempt to get to India as quickly as possible, Raj meets Namrata at the airport.  She is also going to India.  Little does he realize that she is attending the wedding as well as she is a fashion designer working for Raj's uncle.  Raj finds a way to get Namrata to give him her airline ticket by making up an incredible story about his dying son!

The fun has only just begun, as Raj's uncle does, indeed, find a way to get Raj to meet eligible women.  He decides to send Namrata along to help.  The way Raj sabotages his chances with these women is brilliant and downright hiliarious!  Obviously, we understand what is coming next: he begins to develop feelings for Namrata, even though she isn't aware of it for a time.

This may seem like a typical storyline, but there is a twist to this story that I won't mention in this review for those who haven't seen the film yet.

The song and dance numbers are wonderful in this movie.  As explained by a popular Bollywood actor, ""A movie without music and dance is like a movie without special effects for westerners.""

This movie is just pure, genuine fun.  It does, indeed, carry a powerful message about the perception of women, and hopefully, this might serve to influence the Asian belief system about women in many of their societies.  What does it mean to be a husband?  What does it mean to be a wife?  Are they simply titles or should they mean something?

Every now and then, I find myself watching the old classic films.  The stories and performances had a wonderful charm that I find is sadly lacking in most of today's films.  I'm happier now that I can start setting my sights on Bollywood films for the same thing.

If these are the kinds of movies you love and enjoy, then you simply can't go wrong with Kuch Naa Kaho.  You'll find it to be one of the most wonderful three hours you've spent watching a film in a long time.  At least, I did.",1164067200,4,3835,4.444763271162123
8061767,5,B0009J6OQ6,"I love this movie. It's one of the first Bollywood movies I watched and I just fell in love with it. I enjoy the dancing and music in this movie. Aishwarya and Abhishek are  perfect together. When I want to introduce people to Bollywood I have them watch this and they genuinely like it, even guys.  Bollywood movies are long, like 3 hours.  If your like me, you can drag out the movie for 4 or 5 days and pretend it's a mini novella. Same style as Mexican novellas.  I would recommend this movie to someone unsure of what these movies are like, because this one is sooooo good.",1163030400,,578,4.275229357798165
8061768,5,B0009J6OQ6,It is a great movie to watch and time will not matter when you are watching a good movie. I love watching Ashiwarya Rai and I thought she did a great job in this movie and she has great onscreen chemistry with Abhishek Bachchan. It is a beautiful comedy romance and I love the songs and dance number. Great movie to watch.,1145404800,2,322,4.209677419354839
8061769,5,B0009J6OQ6,"This movie was great. Kuch Naa Kaho (Say No More) was my second bollywood movie (if you count Bride & Prejudice as full-on bollywood) and I enjoyed it so much I've actually sat through it twice already (to inform the reader, i am a manly man who lives and breathes sports; watching a 2 and half hour flick with sub-titles is a big deal for me, as well as a step up in my social evolution, 'cording to my girl). I'm not saying that I've become a full-on bollywood fan, just an ardent Aishwarya Rai slave.

Anyway, the basic plot: Raj lives in America and is tricked into going to India to go to his sister's wedding, suspecting all the while that his matchmaking uncle'll try to marry him off. He meets Namrata (Aishwarya Rai) by a cute coincidence; later, Namrata is talked into guiding/babysitting the reluctant Raj as he dates the five women set up by his uncle; of course, it turns out the perfect chica for him is Namrata; but then there's a little twist...

The first two hours mostly pass in comedic fashion, now and then interrupted by song & dance numbers, then it segues into soap opera drama in the final 30-40 minutes. By the way, I just realized I haven't even mentioned the lead actor's name. It is Abhishek Bachchan and, apparently, he is the son of a famous actor (the director, Rohan Sippy, is also the son of a famous director). Abhishek as Raj does a pretty good job. I found myself liking the fella, even though he was romancing the girl of my dreams (I'm sure I have a shot; after all, I am a manly man). Abhishek's sense of humor shines through (check out the ""making of"" on the bonus dvd to see how laid back and cheerful this cat is) but he also holds up well in the dramatic scenes. Some friends more refined than me and who, therefore, have seen multitudes of foreign films have commented that Kuch Naa Kaho is actually ""a refreshing confection added to the bollywood genre, flavored with up-to-date themes and values and peppered with more modern styles of music."" Me, I just get hungry with that kind of talk. The thing about a lengthy movie like this is that, if you're enjoying it, you fall deeper into the story so that by the end, you're truly wrapped up into the tale and you have a deeper investment in the characters and what befalls them. Now let's go into the movie's not so secret weapon. For that, I'm gonna start a new paragraph.

Aishwarya Rai makes this movie work. I'm a layman when it comes to acting; basically, I know what I like. But, to me, Rai has that light, deft touch that is desperately needed with romantic comedies such as this. She is luminously beautiful, yet refreshingly down-to-earth. She makes the musical segments a sheer pleasure to watch. I've replayed the songs so often I could probably describe every dance step and hum every note right now...but I won't. And Omigosh her eyes! ...look, I've obviously degenerated into this rambling mode now so do yourself a favor, dear reader, and order this movie. This woman gets 10,000 e-mails daily worldwide. You're gonna make it 10,001. Cheers.",1141430400,,3051,4.533575317604356
8061770,5,B0009J6OQ6,"Raj (Abhishek Bachchan), is a 26 year old non-resident Indian (NRI), living in New York City.  We learn, from the beginning, that Raj is opposed to arranged marriages, and the very concept strikes him as very disagreeable.  He travels to Mumbai, to be at the wedding of his cousin, and has a chance encounter with a beautiful stranger, Namrata (Aishwarya Rai), on the way there.  They become reacquainted, when it turns out both of them are attending his cousin's wedding.  Namrata is hired on as his would-be ""matchmaker,"" but it turns out she might be the best match for him, after all.  Will love conquer all, even if a secret from Namrata's past threatens to keep them apart?

This is a well-done, well-acted and thoughtful film.  I really reccomend it. It has, both, drama, comedy, romance and beautiful dance numbers.",1134345600,4,823,4.835714285714285
8061771,4,B0009J6OQ6,"Aishwarya Rai knows how to pick her movies.  She does a brilliant job in every single one of them.  Kuch Na Kaho is no different.  There's plenty of charm, heart-warming moments, heart-breaking moments and several light, but romantic interludes.  Not as romantically oriented as ""Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam"", but defintely a great story about love in modern India.

At his mother's request, Raj begrudginly goes to India for his cousin's wedding only to be pressured by his uncle to find a bride.  His uncle orders his favorite and very lovely employee, Namrata, to do the match-making.  Neither of the two are thrilled about the idea, but over time Raj falls deeply in love with her. However, Namrata holds back because of some baggage in her past that eventually comes back to haunt the both of them.

The plot is enjoyable and you can't really see which way it'll end until the very last moment.  As always, great musical numbers. Definitely worth the watch.",1134172800,5,957,4.786585365853658
8061772,5,B0009J6OQ6,"For anyone who would like to see a light-hearted comedy that stresses the importance of family and relationships, this is a must see. I absolutely loved this film, and would watch it over and over again.",1121644800,3,203,4.666666666666667
