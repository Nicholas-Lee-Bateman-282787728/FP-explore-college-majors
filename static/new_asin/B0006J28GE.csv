There is a scene of a Carnaval parade that lasts a minute or so and that's all the Carnaval cultural background that you will find. This video was shot in the 1970's, and I don't find it funny at all!! I gave the video to a Puertorican friend. Hope he will enjoy more than I did!",1240099200,,411,4.15

Mexican comic figure Tin Tan (German Valdes) and his ever-present straight man Marcelo enjoy the festival atmosphere in PUERTO RICO EN CARNAVAL. The International Airport in Puerto Rico on the day of carnival is the setting of this musical comedy. The general manager of the airport no longer wants to deal with the craziness that the annual holiday brings, so he promotes his assistant and secretary to deal with the myriad problems. But this strategy, of course, backfires, leading to a series of hectic and comedic misunderstandings and difficulties.
