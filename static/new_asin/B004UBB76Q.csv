8441368,5,B004UBB76Q,This is the best music video that I've ever seen.  I'm prior military and I'm very proud of our flag and everything it stands for.  I wish there were more videos like this one.  We need to get back to being proud of our country and what our ancestors did to make this a great place to live without fear of being shipped off to a place like Siberia because we might disagree with the current President.,1394064000,2,401,4.181818181818182
