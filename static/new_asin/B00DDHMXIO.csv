8592164,5,B00DDHMXIO,"I am a fan, so had to have this.  Blue Ray works on US devices.  Don't buy a DVD unless correct region.  Excellent document of 1st major tour of Japan.  I think that Perfume's best era was pre-debut to maybe just before the first tour.  All subsequent releases are great, but the first precious few are the best of the bunch... As pop groups get bigger, they  start getting over-produced.  This tour is Perfume starting to get more production help from their company.  This I suppose is normal, but the ""spontaneity"" which is Perfume's biggest strength is starting to get replaced by production...
Now, don't get me wrong, over-production extravaganda have their places... but.... alas they need to entertain more and more people simulaneously as they become more famous.  So, those of you who can afford to travel to their ""WORLD TOUR"" or the most recent ""NORTH AMERICAN TOUR""... DO IT!!!!  The OUTSIDE OF JAPAN TOURS show the best of PERFUME...",1477094400,,946,4.819875776397516
8592165,5,B00DDHMXIO,"I bought this in 2015 after being a Perfume fan for nearly 9 years, and out of all the tour/live discs I've seen, this one is the most beautiful, cinematically shot concert recordings of Perfume's career. Glad I didn't buy this until it came out on Blu-Ray -- the HD quality is highly deserved. Triangle tour's tracklist is also one of Perfume's best, dishing out banger after banger of now fan-favorites like NIGHT FLIGHT, Electro World, Dream Fighter, love the world, and that's just the first couple of songs. Since I managed to get the 1st press limited edition (might be out of print by now), it includes some nifty behind the scenes footage (now in HD) on Disc 2 and a sticker that I'll surely never use. Highly recommended for anyone's Perfume collection.",1428796800,2,762,4.6940298507462686
