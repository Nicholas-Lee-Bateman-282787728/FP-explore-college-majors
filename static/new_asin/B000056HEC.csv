1397034,5,B000056HEC,"At a time when Hollywood was producing giant epics with fantastic sets and ""casts of thousands"" there stands a monument to the essentials of great drama and film making.  This film is perhaps the antithesis of its contemporaries.  Like its main character and protagonist, it stands in quiet defiance against the multi-million dollar productions that have faded from memory.
It was filmed in black and white at a time when color film was standard.  There are three simple sets with one very long major scene taking place in one room.  No casts of thousands.  The only special effect is a little late afternoon shower that serves to ease a midpoint climax and help transition the various tensions to resolution.  There is no great musical score either - no great soundtrack.  One very plain jury room, twelve men, a hot day in July, no air conditioning, and more drama and tension than any film I have ever seen.  You literally get sucked into the jury room even on a small screen TV.  It is a pure masterpiece.
I have watched this film dozens of times and I find something new each time.  Even though I know the outcome, the suspense and emotional tension never fade.  The acting is outstanding.  Each actor was superb and well chosen for the role played.  Each actor not only created a memorable character but portrayed, in classic Greco-Roman tradition, a moral-ethical standard.
Twelve angry men is what is advertised and is what you get.  Experience this great film and see that it out-shadows even today's productions.  It is a must for anyone who loves drama and appreciates fine film.
PS.  I must confess - I find this film so enthralling that whenever I come across it while ""channel surfing"" I watch it.  This despite the fact that I own a video and DVD.  Its that good.",1006560000,3,1778,4.680645161290323
1397035,5,B000056HEC,"Twelve Angry Men is a masterpiece of the basics in filmmaking - script, direction and acting.  Set almost entirely in a sweltering courtroom, Reginald Rose's script is perfect in its execution.  The twelve jurors are developed as fully rounded individuals.  Some are developed further than others but each one of the talented actors gets a chance to shine.
Henry Fonda as juror no. 8 is astonishing.  His belief in the American Justice system is what sets him apart from his peers.  He doesn't know that the accused is innocent, but he has a ""reasonable doubt"" and this is enough for him to vote not guilty.  We never learn whether or not the accused was innocent.  It is possible, he actually was a murderer, but such a theory destroys the high morale of the film.
The outcome of the film is never in doubt so it is remarkable how the director, Sidney Lumet, manages to still create so much tension.  When Fonda agrees to a guilty verdict if the other eleven agree on guilty, there is a frightening suspense.  Also the approaching heatwave is valuable in creating the claustrophobic atmosphere.
This ranks alongside Dog Day Afternoon as Lumet's best work and both films share similarites.  To say they're as good as each other is to pay both the highest compliments.",1001548800,4,1267,4.744292237442922
1397036,5,B000056HEC,"This movie shows you a simple truth. Take a fantastic script, twelve fine actors lead by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, no special effects, a very sparse setting that will not distract from the characters and the story and you have a great film. Being filmed in Black and White rather than color also added to to the greatness of this film. What 11 jurors believe to be an open and shut case of homicide turns out not be be so simple when one juror (Fonda) votes not guilty. He is not sure whether the boy is guilty or innocent but he has a reasonable doubt and believes that a capital crime with someone's life on the line deserves more than 5 minutes of the other juror's time. This movie is like an onion; it strips the characters bare and slowly as they talk and listen in the hot and stuffy jury room statements they thought were conclusive begin to become hazy. It's like a mystery being untangled. Even at the end, you really don't know the truth but you do know that the lives of the 12 men have been irrecovably changed. Rose pulls no punches in his dialogue. This movie will still be a classic in 100 years.",998524800,11,1115,4.289099526066351
1397037,5,B000056HEC,"this film is absolutely the best courtroom drama ever produced. i promise you, if you have any intellect at all, you will enjoy this film immensely.
the story is told almost entirely, (with the exception of the first few minutes), within the confines of one room, the jury deliberation room. almost immediately the film captures and demands your attention and holds it.  it is very engrossing. the basic premise is the jurors' deliberation whether to have a young boy convicted and executed for the murder of his father. to divulge anymore of the plot would be ludicrous. watch it for yourself.
as for the DVD, it's an excellent transfer. it offers no special features however, except for the theatrical trailer. this seems to be the standard for films released under the ""VINTAGE CLASSICS"" distribution. it is still worth the price. a very worthy addition to your DVD library.",997660800,4,877,4.925675675675675
1397038,5,B000056HEC,"I was made to watch this movie in my sophomore year of high school by my history professor and after sitting through what I thought would be ""just another early, black & white movie,"" I was stunned to find that there was a gem sparkling underneath. I believe that this is probably one of the best movies ever made, wholly in story. I couldn't care less about who acted in it or how it was filmed or whether or not it is in color. Simply put, the story for ""12 Angry Men"" is one of the most important stories written recently. (I use the word recently in a loose sense.)
Here we have 12 ""average Joes,"" pulled into jury duty from various walks of life to watch a murder trial and decide whether or not the defendent is guilty. It's a story you might hear a friend talk about. The defendent, in this case, will be put to death if found guilty; probably one of the toughest choices any conscious human will ever have to make. The 12 jurors argue the case, its sometimes shaky evidence and their morals, just as jurors would do in real life in such a case. And that's where the gem lies - it exposes the flaws in our judicial system.
""12 Angry Men"" might as well be a true story, as something like this has to have happened before. The film shows how easily some people accept the word of people like them and how easily they condemn people different from them - how easily they let their views get in the way of rational thinking. Our justice system is supposed to provide every defendent with a fair trial, in hopes that the truth be exposed and the proper sentence be judged. ""12 Angry Men"" illustrates the fact that sometimes, defendents aren't always given fair trials. And, in the case of the Puerto Rican boy charged with the murder of his father in the movie, sometimes innocent people are put to death based on simple prejudices. If not for Henry Fonda's character, the boy would have been put to death; even though there *was* reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the crime he was charged with.
If not to discourage people from favoring the death penalty, I believe that ""12 Angry Men"" should be seen to open some people's eyes and help them think rationally. This movie was way ahead of its time in story, in the vein of ""Gentleman's Agreement."" I recommend it to anyone of any age because there are no swears, nudity, or guns in any of the scenes. The only ""violence"" it has is created by the tensions between the 12 jurors and there are no fights of any kind. A masterpiece and a timeless classic.",994809600,2,2508,4.372591006423983
1397039,5,B000056HEC,"While dated in some of it peripheral items, the story and its lessons in prejudice, justice, and certainty are timeless.  And even if that weren't true, the assemblage of talent -- some at their prime, some just starting out -- makes this a classic, all the moreso for being a single set piece with no car chases, no explosions, no gunfire, no sex.  Hollywood should take notes.",991353600,,378,4.626865671641791
1397040,5,B000056HEC,"Throughout its deceptively short 1 1/2 hours, ""12 Angry Men"" keeps the viewer captivated with the simple story of the deliberations from a young man's murder trial. Director Sidney Lumet does a fantastic job of keeping us involved in what amounts to a filmed play, held in the confines of a medium-sized room. He manipulates the ebb and flow of tension (and what tension!) brilliantly, never leaving any doubt as to the title of the picture. The camera moves nimbly among the actors playing the jury, and provides a great illusion of action in what is really a static atmosphere. Henry Fonda heads the ensemble cast of solid actors; the team of men deliver memorable performances. By movie's end, you'll have a definite sense of each character. It's truly wondrous how all involved take an ultimately limited tale and infuse it with a life that lasts far beyond 1957. The film retains an uncanny vitality, and remains provoking to this day.
(A bit of trivia: Fans of ""The Odd Couple"" TV series might remember an early episode that uses ""12 Angry Men"" as the basis for a story about how ""Felix"" and ""Oscar"" met. Part of the humor was, of course, that ""Oscar,"" Jack Klugman, had a role in the classic film.)
MGM is starting to put out a series of releases that it calls ""Vintage Classics."" Despite the reverence of this label, they seem not to value the films' cinematic significance very much. Although this DVD displays an excellent picture and contains good sound (for its age), the movie house hasn't seen fit to equip it with any special features. Indeed, this seems to be par for the course with the ""Vintage Classics."" The ONLY supplement included with ""12 Angry Men"" is a trailer. They don't even provide a booklet! Nevertheless, considering the DVD's technical strengths, the greatness of the film itself, and the price of the product, I don't hesitate to make this ""12 Angry Men"" disc a hearty recommendation.",985219200,7,1917,4.77710843373494
1397041,5,B000056HEC,"The terms ""great"" and ""classic"" have become redundant in ""viewers reviews,"" but what can a person do when confronted with such a marvelous film as ""12 Angry Men.""
I've seen this film dozens of times while working on an elaborate viewing guide for use in senior high school theater arts and social studies classes.
Since I didn't have a VHS copy in my collection, I jumped at the chance of purchasing the newly released DVD version.  As expected this film is beauifully restored and presented on DVD.
For those unfamiliar with this play, they should be alerted to the ""fact"" that virtually every single speech in this drama is of critical importance and lasting meaning, making this one of the most significant films ever produced.
The closeups of sweaty faces magnify the intensity and bitterness.  Lee J. Cobb gives what must be the best performance of his great career.
Why this film didn't win a number of Oscars will always remain a mystery.
Fonda deserves special mention for his role in producing the film.
Why ""Showtime"" went to all the trouble to remake this splendid classic is also a mystery.  I think the 1957 film, it's theme, performances, etc. remain as fresh, alive, and pertinent today as they were in the late 1950s.
The film should be required viewing in ""all"" civic classes, high school and college. The DVD version would make replaying various scenes easy, encouraging indepth examination of the various issues confronted in the film.
C-SPAN should (could) build a three-hour special around ""12 Angry Men,"" with law professors and students discussing the film and the role of juries in our justice system.

There are no emotional appeals in it, just straight deduction and common sense, and willingness to look at facts as they are.

Watch as the excuses, laziness, prejudice - all those things that make us judge people unfairly - get stripped away.  It takes an hour and  a half, so that's enough time to get into some suspense.

1397150,5,B000056HEC,"This film was made in 1957.  It is black-and-white.  The story takes place almost totally in one room--the jury room.  The set consists of a table, chairs, some ash trays, a fan, some windows and a couple of notepads.  The jury consists of, yup, you got it, 12 angry men.

Although this will seem outdated to many with its all-male jury, smoking allowed, no air-conditioning and no fancy meals, the story line transcends all that.  It's a story of reasonable doubt, deductive reasoning/thinking and discovering that things aren't always as they seem.

The 12 men don't start out angry.  One juror is not convinced of the guilt of the accused.  In the process of discussing the details of the crime, tempers flare.

The photography is wonderful--the use of shadows & light and camera angles is a joy to behold.  The interaction between the very diverse men is engaging, and although some of the scenes seem a little stilted (remember this was made in 1957), overall the acting is stellar.

I think this is a great movie to watch with young people to help them learn about tolerance, analyzing information, patience, critical thinking, humility and redemption.

1397179,5,B000056HEC,"This is probably the most successful movie ever filmed 95% in one room, and has probably spawned more parodies than any other (it inspired episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and ""Here's Lucy,"" just to name two of my favorites). I am going to write this review based on the assumption that everyone knows what the movie is about and how it ends, since it's so well known. If you've never seen it, it's not like you can't figure out what's going to happen from the beginning, anyway. Part of the beauty of the movie is it's still compelling anyhow.

While I enjoy special effects, a lot of movies today are beginning to get on my nerves. A movie like this is the greatest proof of what you need to make a good movie. Spectacular acting. Talent. Plot. A strong script. Special effects can help, but you need the rest.

The plot in this movie is so compelling. To go from an open-and-shut case to a case full of holes... simply amazing. Thank goodness for that one angry man. I've never been on a jury, but if I ever am, I would hope my group would take the case just as seriously. It's horrifying to think that they would send a human being to the electric chair without giving it any thought. They're busy; they have a ball game to get to. Guilty or innocent, a person's case merits discussion, and I think that was the whole point.

The weirdest thing was, he was so clearly guilty in the beginning. But in the end, there were problems with absolutely every piece of evidence against him. He was almost clearly innocent. Which was it? It was frustrating not having someone else to convict, as the jurors also commented on. But then, that wasn't their job. If only they could have asked their questions to the witnesses!

I would skip the 1997 remake. It was practically a word-for-word remake. They didn't really add anything to make it their own. Jack Lemmon even kind of looks like an older Henry Fonda! The only way they really improved it was by adding color. (As much as I love classic movies, black & white can be a bummer sometimes.) Of course, they added skin color too. It was a more racially diverse jury. If they wanted to modernize it, they might have thought about adding a woman or two to the jury also. I was confused as to whether or not the new version took place today because of the diversity. I kind of thought the glasses argument was a bit silly, if so. Maybe women were embarrassed to wear their big clunky black glasses in public in the 1950's, but in 1997, that's just not true. Now they're more of a fashion statement. I don't know if the remake knew when it took place. The remake was good, with good acting and great characterizations, bit only if you haven't seen this one.

1397187,5,B000056HEC,"This sterling production is, from beginning to end, one of the very best and easily one of the more topical motion pictures ever made.

Set mostly within a sixteen by twenty-four foot jury room, it introduces us to twelve men of varying background who are called upon to decide the fate of a teenager accused of fatally stabbing his father. The seemingly air-tight nature of the case stirs all but one of these gentlemen into believing the boy deserves nothing but swift and decisive death. The sole standout among them, portrayed distinctively by the legendary Henry Fonda, is left with the unenviable task of steering his peers toward accepting the opinion he has presented: that this very same kid might very well be innocent of the charge against him. This understandably complicates the deliberations and, as an unavoidable result, triggers heated resentment and deeply-rooted prejudice.

To say I simply enjoyed this movie would be a severe understatement. It works on so many levels, the foremost being the absolutely incredible and intricately structured character study it offers. The supporting cast of Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman and all the rest work sheer wonders in breathing the necessary reality into each and every one of these individual men. But I was especially impressed with Lee J. Cobb, who delivers some of the most memorable and quotable lines this side of ""Gone With The Wind."" His character's stubborn worldview, along with Begley's steadfast racism, is just as unfortunate an aspect of today's society as it was way back in 1957 when this film was initially released. I think that's why it's retained such remarkable staying power over so many years. It's an altogether timeless story.

Reginald Rose, it should be mentioned, penned this drama soon after serving in a jury of his own. The film went on to capture four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and has remained a personal favorite of mine for as far back in my life as I can honestly remember.

1397196,5,B000056HEC,"Henry Fonda stars with Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall and a nine other fine character actors in this classic courtroom drama from 1957.  Despite the black-and-white filming and dated costume and props, this story still packs a terrific punch, mainly due to terrific writing and careful attention to dramatic unities of time, place and action.  The story itself has an elegant simplicity to it: a young man is on trial for the murder of his father, and as the film opens we see the jury (12 white men of various distinctive types) being ushered into the jury room to decide his fate.  Eleven of these men are outraged by the brutality of the crime and anxious to return a ""guilty"" verdict.  Only one (Henry Fonda) questions the defendant's guilt.  Using various debating techniques, Fonda reveals his doubts about the various pieces of evidence offered by the prosecution, and gradually begins to put ""reasonable doubt"" into the minds of his fellow jurors.

The conflict in this film (which is pretty much a recording of a stage drama) is between the jurors, not between the alleged murderer and his father, so there's no action in this film beyond 12 angry men heatedly arguing the case.  Some viewers may be turned off by the story's preachiness - admittedly the film is pretty heavy-handed in its liberal bias - but it's still a powerful and soul-stirring evocation of one of Americans' crucial human rights: the trial by jury.  Our judicial system may not be perfect, but this film certainly is.  A must for high school civics class, and a stunning rebuttal to those who doubt that one man can make a difference in this world.",1223337600,2,1626,4.73758865248227

1397210,5,B000056HEC,"This is a beautifully written script. This 1957 movie is all about holding to principles, articulating what you believe and the power of reason and communication. Fonda's ""He can't hear you, he never will. Sit down."" was a powerful example of how ...(read more)one can treat unreceptive people and retain personal dignity. The jurors aren't bad people; most of them have paid attention to the six-day trial and are familiar with the evidence, which is fairly compelling. They are able to discuss it intelligently. The writing is showcased by Sydney Lumet's excellent direction and the glorious, gray cinematography.

A crusty old Anglo-American juror complains of the young defendant, ""He's a common ignorant slob. He don't even speak good English.""

""He *doesn't* even speak good English,"" gently corrects an immigrant juror.

When the juror (played powerfully by Lee J. Cobb) most vocal in support of finding the defendant guilty accidentally, in a pique of passion undermines one of the primary witnesses, it's one of the many sterling moments in the film. Lumet masterfully directs the subsequent silence and reaction among the other jurors.

""You think too much, you get mixed up."" Well, this movie does a fine job of simutaneously ordering and confusing very important matters. It's also respectful of ""the other side""; E.G.

1397215,5,B000056HEC,"Twelve Angry Men was groundbreaking drama when it appeared on CBS's Studio One in 1954. The script, by television writer Reginald Rose (The Defenders), features an all-male ensemble cast in which the characters are nameless jury members in a murder trial. A teenage boy has been accused of knifing his father, and the evidence includes the body, the boy's knife and several witnesses.

The film rights were bought by Henry Fonda, who co-produced the film with Rose in 1957. It was directed by Sidney Lumet and it was his first film. Previously, he had directed television dramas. He went on to direct some very famous films, including Serpico, Murder On The Orient Express, Network, Dog Day Afternoon and The Verdict.

When the 12 Angry Men begins, the jury is filing into the jury room to consider their verdict. The camera angle is wide and high, creating a sense of  space. But as the drama progresses, it tightens to a long, low lens. Lumet says he did this to create a sense of claustrophobia.

Only one member of the jury believes the boy on trial may be innocent (Henry Fonda). The others are totally convinced of his guilt. Over the course of the film, they debate the evidence and, one-by-one, change their minds. How that happens is what makes this such a remarkable film, and one of the true gems of screenwriting.

The cast is practically a Who's Who of character actors, including Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. Some of the performances - like Fonda, Cobb, Marshall, Klugman and Warden - are remarkable.

The script is masterful, as it weaves the psyches of the twelve jurors into one taut drama. Even though the entire story takes place in a single room, and there is really no ""action"" per se, it is spellbinding to watch each man wrestle with his own conscience in light of his ever growing doubts over the evidence. It is pretty obvious where the film is heading: but how it gets there is what makes it so fascinating.

12 Angry Men should be required viewing for every man, woman and child in America because it shows our legal system in action better than anything I've ever seen. It is a story about how easy it is to presume someone's guilt based on prejudice, anger or circumstantial evidence. The power of questions - and a reasonable doubt - is all it takes to turn a jury dead set against a defendant totally around.

The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay Oscars, and won the Writers Guild of America Award, among others.

The story keeps you in and the fonda rallies you to his side with every minute of the movie. I loved it and gladly watch it from time to time and stands as a classic among a sea of movies of old.,1189814400,,453,3.778947368421053
1397231,5,B000056HEC,"The word ""classic"" is thrown around a lot these days; we're expected to like something simply because some jamoke with a film degree tells us it's a classic, whether the film itself is actually any good or not.  So it's rare indeed to find a movie like 12 Angry Men that actually deserves to be called a classic.

Chances are good that you already know the plot, even if you've never seen the movie: Murder trial, 11 jurors think the kid's guilty, one thinks there's room for doubt, and he proceeds to spend the next couple of hours convincing the rest to see things his way.  He wins out in the end against overwhelming odds, everyone goes home secure in the knowledge that justice has been served to the best of their ability, and the credits roll.  I'm massively oversimplifying things, I admit, but that's the gist of it.  So why does this movie deserve to be called a classic?

For one thing, it's one of the few films of the 1950's to address the issue of racism, and although it's addressed somewhat obliquely (the characters never actually come out and say the word ""racism,"" relying instead on somewhat less volatile terms such as ""their kind""), the fact that it's addressed at all is noteworthy, to say the least.  Several of the jurors are convinced of the kid's guilt not because they seriously have reason to believe he did it, but because of their preconceived notions about his background: ""He's a poor Puerto Rican kid from the wrong side of town, so he must be guilty.  QED.""  Of course, other jurors reveal that they themselves came from exactly that sort of background, which forces the others--and, by extension, the viewing audience--to reexamine their world view.  The message may seem a little heavy-handed by today's standards, but for the time it was a revolutionary notion.  (It's also a message that bears repeating today; I'm reminded of the man--I use the term loosely--who was convicted of murder not long after 9/11, and his only defense was that ""it's what every real American wants to do anyway.""  The victim was a gas station owner from India whose faith required him to wear a turban.)

More than any of that, though, the film succeeds because of the absolutely unpretentious performances of the actors, particularly Henry Fonda as the sole dissenting vote.  He plays his character not as a man who is convinced that he's right and will fight to the death if he has to, but as a man who knows full well that ""reasonable doubt"" doesn't automatically mean the kid is innocent.  He's always aware that the kid may indeed be guilty, and even says as much at one point; but his conscience will not let him condemn another human being to die simply because he's been bullied into it.  The cause he's fighting for isn't just to protect the innocent, but to protect the sanctity of the process itself.  On the other hand, his foil throughout much of the film, played by Lee J. Cobb, is his polar opposite, his moral compass colored as much or more by his emotions as his sense of logic and reason.  He reveals early on that he's been estranged from his son for a number of years, and that estrangement (the defendant is around the same age his son was when they parted ways) drives his desire to find the defendant guilty even when he's presented with evidence that the kid might be innocent.  When he finally breaks down at the film's end, the result is a performance that will leave even the most jaded viewer with a tear in their eye; in an era when boys were taught from an early age that men don't cry, such a performance would have been almost unheard of, but it's delivered with absolute candor and sincerity.

The DVD release doesn't include much in the way of extras, just the original trailer, but that doesn't matter.  The film itself stands up so well on its own that anything else would just seem superfluous.",1188950400,2,3849,4.597953216374269

It was inspiring to see people's prejudices begin to melt away as the discussion continued.

Everyone should see this film, especially those who are about to serve as jurors and those who are interested in the justice system.

1397234,5,B000056HEC,"1957's ""Twelve Angry Men"" is the story of a jury confined to a small room on a hot, humid summer night to decide the fate of a young man accused of knifing his father to death.  The jury's initial poll has eleven jurors for guilty, one for innocent.  The ensuing drama revolves around the struggle by the dissenting juror, an architect played with characteristic understated determination by Henry Fonda, to convince the other jurors of the presence of reasonable doubt.

The outstanding cast, a collection of experienced 1950's movie and tv actors who may not be familiar to today's audiences, each bring their particular insights and prejudices to the debate.  An elderly man, played by Joseph Sweeney, sides with the Henry Fonda character because he admires the younger man's grit.  Lee J. Cobb has an outstanding role as an angry father who sees his estranged son in the actions attributed to the young man on trial.  E.G. Marshall plays a confident businessman who gets a lesson in the limits of memory from the Henry Fonda character.

The confining atmosphere of the jury room adds to the tension.  Sidney Lumet's brisk but deliberate direction allows each man a turn in the spotlight to examine his conscience as well as the case in front of the other jurors.  The end result is a tense, insightful drama about the nature of man and justice.

1397238,4,B000056HEC,"The plot of 12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trial of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities.  The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems.

1397254,5,B000056HEC,"Twelve Angry Men succeeds on a number of levels. First, it serves as an excellent lesson in civics. In particular, it illustrates the application of the Seventh Amendment, a component of the Bill of Rights (see below).

Seventh Amendment. In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

Twelve Angry Men also can be used to illustrate an application of Right number nine, in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the document that served as the basis for the French Revolution (see below).

Right Number Nine. As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, if arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all harshness not essential to the securing of the prisoner's person shall be severely repressed by law.

During the story, Henry Fonda repeatedly emphasizes that the correct standard of guilt, for use in a criminal trial, is the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard. In fact, the main focus of Twelve Angry Men is on Henry Fonda's burden of persuading the other jurors that they should be applying this standard, and not, for example, the less stringent standard of guilt that us used during civil court cases. Again, the film provides an excellent civics lesson, for those interested in how to apply the ""burden of proof.""

Furthermore, the story is good for children (ten and up) in that the plot follows a predictable path. One by one by one, each of the jurors explains why he believes that the suspect, a boy, should be found guilty of murder. And one by one by one, each of the jurors is persuaded, by a parade of evidence, that the boy is innocent. The parade of evidence includes the character of the switchblade thrust, the elevated train that drowns out the scream, the slow velocity of an elderly walking witness, and the pinched nose that demonstrated that a key witness needed glasses and couldn't see well, especially when rising from bed in the middle of the night. The plot is easy to follow for most kids who are ten or older. The story plods along with great delibration, just like the little engine that could, who cried out, ""I think I can, I think I can."" The story is also good for kids in that there are no bad words. Despite the fact that the story is about ""anger,"" especially Lee J. Cobb's anger and Ed Begley's anger, the dreaded ""F word"" does not even make a cameo appearance.

The story also succeeds on a dramatic level. This is an ensemble piece, similar to John Hughes' The Breakfast Club. We are introduced to twelve different personalities. Lee J. Cobb's personality is ferocious, while Jack Warden's personality is goofy. Jack Warden wears a striped hat and coat, and his mind is not much on the trial, but more on the baseball ticket that is ""burning a hole in his pocket."" Robert Webber, an advertising man, also provides provides goofy comic relief. Ed Begley is the archetypical bigot, shamelessly spouting stereotypic rantings typical of any bigoted fanatic. John Fiedler also provides variety, as he has a whispy high voice, similar to that of Sterling Holloway. John Fiedler served as the voice of Piglet in Winnie the Pooh cartoon movies. (Sterling Holloway played the voice of the bear, Winnie the Pooh.) The thunderstorm, which makes its appearance at the halfway point, also contributes to the drama. Viewers will also be glad to see Jack Klugman, a familiar face from several Twilight Zone episodes. Jack Klugman, a former child of the urban ghetto, provides the insight that the alleged murder weapon, a switchblade, could not have been used by the accused, because of the fact that the wound was from a downwards thrust, whereas switchblades were designed to be used mainly for upward-moving thrusts.

The story also serves as a good illustration of theater techniques. For example, we see the technique of symbolism, where Henry Fonda is dressed in white. We also see another theatrical technique, in a scene where most of the jurors stand up in unison and turn their backs to a juror who harbors an unpopular view. Certainly, this strange mannerism would never appear in real life. It is a theatrical technique that symbolizes the fact that most of the jurors disagree with the one man.

The story has a surprise ending, wherein Lee J. Cobb's motivation for cherishing his guilty finding is revealed, and when Lee J. Cobb comes to terms with his own motivation, and where he changes his mind to not guilty. FIVE STARS.

If you truly admire TWELVE ANGRY MEN (which I do), then I might recommend seeking the corresponding episode in the television series of THE DEAD ZONE.  TWELVE ANGRY MEN was re-scripted, somewhat, for this sci-fi television program.  Anthony Michael Hall plays the Henry Fonda role.  One might remember Anthony Michael Hall for his role of the geek, in SIXTEEN CANDLES.  Before seeking the episode of DEAD ZONE, it might help first, to see the original movie, THE DEAD ZONE, starring Christopher Walken.",1172880000,3,5139,4.80634201585504
1397255,5,B000056HEC,"I watched this movie last week as part of my coursework on Influence. This film is often used at business schools as a case study in negotiations, conflict management, team building, persuasion, etc.
The story is about twelve jurors who need to decide whether a teenager accused of killing his father was guilty or not. A guilty verdict would result in a death sentence. The preliminary vote is eleven to one in favor of guilty. The only juror who votes not guilty is an architect played by Henry Fonda. He is unsure and proceeds by asking probing questions. The rest of the movie takes you through their decision making process.
I will not spoil the story for you but will elaborate on what you should look out for while watching the movie. Pay close attention to the 12 characters. Each has a unique personality, influenced by their prejudices. Observe how they interact and how the coalitions are formed. Be aware of when public voting and private voting are used. Observe how Henry Fonda remains calm and impartial throughout the process and attacks issues and not people. Overall, observe how interpersonal and procedural tactics influence group decisions.
The 12 jurors - referred to by juror number and seated in clockwise order on the table:
1. The foreman - an assistant football coach
2. Bank teller - has a high-pitched voice and wears glasses
3. Businessman - who is aggressive and has a broken relationship with his son
4. Stockbroker - arrogant, self-confident and driven by the facts
5. Man from the slums - quiet and self-conscious, dressed in a suit
6. House painter - strong physically, stands up for his principles
7. Salesman - wears a straw hat and cares primarily about a baseball game he might miss
8. Architect (Henry Fonda) - calm, impartial and rational
9. Old man - weak physically but with a strong sense of justice
10. Garage owner - aggressive person who harbors a prejudice against slum people
11. Watchmaker - of European origin, speaks with an accent and has a strong ethical obligation to do his duty as an American citizen
12. Ad executive - sits on the fence and contributes more fluff than substance.
This movie is on my list of the five greatest movies ever made. Great script, direction and acting. I highly recommend it, especially to managers and leaders.",1172880000,11,2296,4.785894206549118
1397256,5,B000056HEC,"No film ever ever made has told a more in depth story with so little attention to anything beyond the bare necessities and managed to pull off anything of this caliber.  This little film easily ranks up there with the best of all of them, including Casablanca -- and this comes from somebody who really loves the film Casablanca.  And yet, the entire film, save for a few short seconds of the very beginning and end, takes place in a small stuffy little room filled with 12 people -- 11 of which don't want to be there.  And there lies our movie.

When there are less components in a given whole, it is more important for each component to do its job well.  This film really only has three components, the script, the cast, and the direction.  The reason this is such a good film is because all three are superb, with the cast arguably being the strongest.  Most of the people in this movie are people you have seen before and will recognize -- Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, and Jack Klugman are some of the more familiars faces.  Most notably however is Henry Fonda in the leading role.  He is the one man willing to stand against the tide.  While he played many good roles in his life, this one has to rank near the top.  Its hard to believe that this is the same guy who played the grumpy old codger in ""On Golden Pond"", or even the frustrated Tom Joad in ""Grapes of Wrath"".  Fonda's performance is as cool as his character -- whose every argument is a case study in logic and reason.

The rest of the cast, along with the claustrophobic setting, bring to mind Hitchcock.  Each member has a distinct personality and offers a different perspective on society -- A businessman, a salesman, an immigrant, an elderly gentleman, a man from a poor background, a bigot, and a few men from various working class jobs.  As different as each one is however, they all agree for one reason or another that the kid on trial is guilty and they all want to go home.  When Fonda's character, a remarkably stoic and clear thinking architect, starts engaging the other jurors, both collectively and individually, things get tight.

As the title states, this movie is about twelve men who get angry.  And over the course of the film all of them do, some frequently.  Even the cool headed Fonda has a few short but dignified outbursts.  This movie clearly illustrates the fact that nothing can blow another person's stack like a compelling argument.  And this is where direction gets showcased.  There are no wasted scened or lines in this film.  Every camera angle is perfect.  I particularly like the shot of Henry Fonda sticking the knife into the table. It personifies the entire film in a single shot -- very simple but effective.  It is moments like these that crescendo as jurors start defecting one by one offer to Fonda's side.

There is sort of an equilibrium that seems to take place.  As there become fewer jurors holding onto their guilty votes their anger increases, particularly Lee J Cobb's.  Although personally of all the jurors that hold on the longest to their guilty vote I like E.G. Marshall the best.  He is almost the alter ego to Fonda.  He is a cool calculating person who will not let go of his reasons until he has a compelling argument to force him to do so.  He also holds no loyalty to other jurors because their votes happen to agree with his.  One is the best lines in the movie comes just after Lee J Cobb complains about Fonda baited him into an argument.  Marshall doesn't even look at him.  He simply turns away and remarks, ""he did an excellent job.""

As far as the DVD itself is concerned, this is an excellent representation of a classic B&W film that has been nicely restored. This film probably did not look this good when it was first released.  There are no extras to speak of on this disc -- just a clean transfer of the movie.  Ordinarily this would warrant the loss of a star.  In this case however, is seems to fit very nicely with the ""Less is More"" theme.  Like the movie itself, it is all that this disk requires.",1172361600,6,4058,4.461956521739131

As is not surprising the theme of justice takes center stage, but looked at from a unique angle, the eyes of twelve jury members who have to deliberate on the matter of guilt of a teenager who supposedly killed his father and is up for the death penalty. One could say this is the entire movie in a nutshell, but what drama unfolds! None of those present will ever forget this particular hour and a half, nor will the viewer I dare say.

The amount of evidence against the boy seems overwhelming:  a weak alibi, a knife,which looks exactly like one he used to own and which he now claims to have lost, found at the crime scene and even an old lady maintaining she saw him commit the murder.

One might conclude a clearcut case and it is with no surprise that the first voting round results in 11 of 12 guilty verdicts. As a unanimous vote is required the 11 are annoyed that one of them is what most of them deem to be wasting their time. That one jury member turns out to be Henry Fonda, who is not so much convinced the boy to be innocent, but feels they should at least discuss the case for a while as a life is at stake.

Obviously clearly fighting an uphill battle an analysis of the case commences, raising an increasing amount of doubt in most jury members' minds, but what is more interesting about this movie is the character study of these pillars of the community, of which one couldn't care less as long as he still makes it in time to the ball game, while another is consumed by racial hatred (the accused is black) and yet another projects his own personal drama with his own son on the accused. One could argue therefor that the whole judicial process has not so much to do with justice as with personal predispositions of its dispensers.

The film adheres to the classic unity of time and place and clearly shows its theatrical history. The cast is sublime and especially Lee J. Cobb as the embittered father makes an unforgettable impression. Same goes for Ed Begly as the bigot and last bot not least Henry Fonda playing the common man with simple dignity. Ah well, there simply is no weak link in this terrific ensemble piece.

This is the kind of movie that contains dialogue like metal sparks coming at you from the tv screen, where social commentary is still taken seriously and mankind is viewed in all its weaknesses and prejudices, taking a moral stance without cynicism, which may seem outdated in our day and age, but in no way deminishes the impact the movie still has to this day.

Doubt 2: The defense attorney was not aggressive and vigilant in his defense of the defendant.  The defense attorney had not financial incentive to perform.

Doubt 3: The expectation to remember the names of actors and movies the boy saw on the night of the murder was unreasonable.  The boy was under emotional stress hampering his ability to recall information.

Doubt 4:  The knife was not unique and the exact knife could be purchased locally at a store in close proximity from where the defendant lived.  Shattering the associated connection that the boy had purchased a unique weapon.  Prosecution had discredited the defendant's claim that he lost the switch-blade through a hole in his pocket.

Why would the defendant careful clean the weapon, leave it at the crime scene, and then return; only to be captured by the police.

Doubt 7:  The killer used a downward strike to kill the victim.  The defendant was an expert knife fighter and would have used an upward thrust.  Secondly, the defendant was about 5 feet 7 inches and the killer knife entry angle suggested a taller person.

1397269,5,B000056HEC,"I first saw this movie years ago on the late late when I was around [...] years old.  It impressed me and gave me a lot to think about.  Today, and over the years, it still does.

It achieves something which the best writing does-but it achieves it in a way that is fully cinematic.  A book could not substitute for it.  What makes it stand the test of time--and have appeal to many personal ages and stages--is its multiple layers.  This is not just one story.  It is actually several stories overlapping-and interpenetrating.

Having watched it many times, it seems that every frame counts for something.  Virtually the whole story takes place in one small jury room, of which we are given the benefit of seeing from virtually every perspective.  The same for the characters, which are themselves anything but two dimensional.  The film does not have a dull moment--not even when the characters themselves are doodling and  bored!

When I first saw the movie, I thought that it had something to do with human perfection always being within reach even in an imperfect situation.  An imperfectly conducted trial with a selection of angry and biased jurors working within an imperfect system of law is brought to perfection as the jurors gradually realize that doubt is always possible and so the law itself forbids the death penalty-it merely leaves the decision in the hands of the jurors.  That was my understanding when I was nine.  I have since seen many other ways of looking at it and, though I still think that in some way the theme of perfection under imperfect circumstances is part of it, I also think there are many other layers.

Though I all but have the dialogue memorized, I still notice new things when I watch it again.  This was a very studied production, from the exact wording of the script, to the body language of the characters and direction and camera angles--again from the smallest details, beginning with simply the jurors trying to get comfortable and make their ""space"" as they are locked in the jury room-along with the small interpersonal exchanges--right up to the involved discussions and passionate confrontations.

An important story layer lies in the theme of how conformity shapes human opinion, and what an individual can and cannot do to effectively awaken the use of reason in a group of people-not simply establishing another conformity or fashion.  This is perhaps the predominant layer, insofar as it coincides with what the film is most famous for: one lone juror, voting not guilty, holding out against and eventually persuading the other 11 who were voting guilty.  Here it is an exceptionally good character study, showing how different possible psychological motives and dispositions may result in more or less flawed perceptions of, even concern for, truth.  The film has been called optimistic, and it is in the sense that it suggests that under the right circumstances, this concern can be rekindled in everyone-that it is universal.

Another story layer lies in the theme of how leadership works and what it means.  There are several characters who, for different reasons, represent ""natural leaders,"" and several others who, for different reasons, represent ""natural followers.""  But things never quite naturally fall into place, and the struggles between the characters as they vie for position never quite works out as they, or even the audience, expects.  But what happens is very believable, and there is not a cheap shot taken in the whole plot.  Ultimately there is a showdown between the hero and his chief nemesis, but the nemesis winds up performing what is perhaps the most morally heroic act in the whole film.

It is also an excellent detective story, an excellent whodunit.  The guilty verdict which seems cut and dried at the beginning is gradually and effectively analyzed as it is supplemented with details so that it does become questionable-and not in a cheap way; it still leaves you thinking.

Acting is very good.  I'd rank Henry Fonda's low key performance his masterpiece.  Also the masterpiece of a number of masterful character actors.

1397274,5,B000056HEC,"With the recent deaths of Jack Warden (just this past week) and John Fiedler, only Jack Klugman survives from the original 1957 movie cast of this blistering, uncommonly well acted drama, a triumphant first feature for now-revered director Sidney Lumet. Written by veteran TV scribe Reginald Rose, the story takes place almost entirely within the confines of a Manhattan jury room. Already overheated by the scorching weather, the twelve men are locked in heated debate over the fate of a ghetto youth accused of murdering his father. Over the course of ninety minutes, we get to know the individual personalities of the jurors in ways that surprise even themselves in a most claustrophobic setting.

The chief battle occurs between Juror #8, who believes a comprehensive discussion of the evidence is necessary before coming to a verdict, and Juror #3, who is convinced it is an open-and-shut case. The drama unfolds as the others move from one side to the other, as questions of objectivity and neutrality are put to the test with each character. It certainly helps to have a sterling cast of familiar faces inhabit the roles of the nameless jurors. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8 with his becalming dignity constantly stretched by the ongoing pressure of a fast verdict. Never the most subtle of actors, Lee J. Cobb is a blustery force as Juror #3 as he slowly reveals his own personal issues leading to his seemingly intractable guilty verdict.

E.G. Marshall plays the cold-blooded elitist stockbroker, while Edward Binns is the inarticulate house painter intent on maintaining a sense of fair play in the room. Warden is a small-time hustler only interested in making the baseball game, Fiedler (later memorable as the meek Mr. Peterson on ""The Bob Newhart Show"") is the eager bank teller who demands to be heard, Martin Balsam is the overly accommodating foreman uncomfortable in his role as the foreman and Robert Webber is the glad-hand pre-yuppie willing to go with the crowd.

The most vivid impressions are left by Ed Begley's unapologetic racist, George Voskovec's dignified watch maker, Joseph Sweeney's seemingly befuddled senior; and Klugman's shy juror who more than anyone else, comes to empathize with the accused. The film's one slight flaw is that it tips its hand at the outset with the tone of passivity emanating from the judge and the wide-eyed fear in the accused's face. The black-and-white film comes in a clean print on the 2001 DVD but little else except the original theatrical trailer. A masterful work of economy and escalating dramatic tension.",1154390400,6,2574,5.037558685446009

That being the case, exactly how than did the 1957 film '12 Angry Men' become such an American classic?

First of all, it's directed by Sidney Lumet. That's definitely an excellent beginning. Add to that one of the most erudiate, well-conceived scripts ever with some of the most memorable, quotable lines of all-time and you're halfway to success. Lastly, collect an ensemble cast of some of the greatest character actors of all-time to surround the legendary Henry Fonda and you've got a hit.

I'm actually not crazy about the message this play sends (by extension, nobody should ever be convicted of any crime, as there can always be some tiny element of doubt) - it sort of undermines prosecutors, although with good intentions.  Good intentions always bring the worst consequences.  And it is simply not possible that even an assistant prosecutor would have missed all the blatant details discovered by the jurors.  The beauty of the plot is in the unmasking of each juror's motivations and fears leading to his particular intitial guilty pronouncement.

1397288,5,B000056HEC,"For a movie based mostly in the necessity for repetition and seeing both sides of the issue, it does not, like it would seem, make one tired of hearing the phrase ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""  This is an issue of objectivity, the idea that has taken centuries of philosophers to finally understand doesn't exist in a subjective standpoint.  I can say nothing about this film that isn't repeated, with full clarity, in the dialog under many different contexts.  They hold a man's life in their hands, and in the process are going to learn a lot about what must go into the proof.

To be a bit honest, and a little hesitant, I must say that a lot of it strikes me as pretty liberal.  I think this film is strongest when it doesn't get into politics, so the constant repetition of the phrase ""bleeding heart"" kind of gets to me.  However, it's something of a necessity, because one of the things that these characters have to overcome is personal politics and prejudice to figure out where exactly to take a stand and where to leave be.  And as a product of its time, it's immensely profound.

What I like most about it is that it is not a criticism of the American system, it's actually in full support of it.  If it criticizes anything, it criticizes the people who take it aloofly and don't understand the power they hold when they operate within said system.  Responsibility is something I personally find quite lacking currently, and it's nice to see a movie expound the virtues of personal responsibility towards lawful conduct.  This does not mean falling into hegemonic status quo, for that would mean the boy dies because nobody takes the time to question him.  This means making sure you understand what you know and what you can't know.

Beyond the writing itself, the directing and the acting really shine.  It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera shows the audience EXACTLY what it needs to know when it needs to know it.  It's art to be beheld.  Also, all of the actors maintain their characters and the characters' mood swings amazingly, making it fluid and above all, very real.

For a director to make his debut into Hollywood, Sidney Lumet sure made a huge splash with this masterpiece. The concept of 12 jurors in a courtroom for the entire film, without any of them knowing each other at all at the beginning of the film, makes this movie worthwhile. The character advancement throughout this film is perhaps what makes it so interesting. Also, the variety of the characters involved makes for a truly remarkable viewing experience.

The main concept deals with the trial of a boy who has been charged with first-degree murder. The jurors must decide the boy's fate, knowing that if he is accused, he will face a death sentence which will send him to the electric chair. For 11 of the jurors, the verdict seems simple. Guilty as charged. But for the other juror, played by Henry Fonda, he feels that there is still a possibility the boy is innocent.

As the movie progresses, the facts are laid out on the table so to speak. But also the possibilities are explored, leading to a jury divided. The growing unity of the characters throughout this film is once again, true brilliance. This script could not have been written any better than it was.

All in all, this is a film that someone of any age can enjoy. The story hooks you from beginning to end, and the characters are ones that many people can relate to. This is a must-watch for any film fan or someone just wanting to catch a great movie.

1397291,5,B000056HEC,"This is a courtroom drama with a difference. Apart from a very brief scene in the courtroom itself, the film takes place in the jury's deliberation room. The whole film revolves around the deliberations of a jury in a murder case in which a guilty verdict will lead to the death penalty for the accused. Initially it all seems very clear-cut with an all male jury having decided on a the young mans guilt before they have even sat down, all that is except for one man (Henry Fonda). Although he believes the accused may have possibly committed the murder, his values and ethics won't allow him to agree with his fellow jurors without thrashing out all of the evidence. Gradually he forces the other men to confront the evidence in front of them and to admit the situation is not as clear cut as it seemed. At the same time they are brought face to face with their own prejudices.

Filmed in black and white and shot almost entirely in one room, this film allows the viewer to concentrate entirely on the dialogue with nothing to distract from the story. It is a credit to the acting skills of the cast and to the direction of Sidney Lument (in his directorial debut) that the film remains gripping throughout.

This usually is deadly in the case of a movie but it is definitely needed to make this movie work.  A claustrophobic atmosphere is required for this to work.

To eleven of the jurors this is an open and shut case but to one (Henry Fonda) things don't quite shape up.  Most of the jurors have other things to do and just want to get this over with.  But as they go over the evidence one by one the jurors must face the facts don't add up.

This is a brilliant look at the jury process.  Each of the twelve jurors were given their own backstory and personality.  This was an early directorial effort of Sidney Lumet and he shows early on what he is capable of doing.

Fonda once again gives a well measured performance.  He shows that he has a great command of drama.  Add to Fonda, film an stage veterans Lee J Cobb, Ed Begley and EG Marshall plus newcomers Jack Klugman and Robert Webber and you have a powerhouse cast.

1397298,5,B000056HEC,"12 Angry Men is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their lives.  For those of you who have never heard of it, here is a synopsis: After hearing a fairly ""open and shut"" trial about a boy who is accused of murdering his father, the 12 jurors have to decide whether or not to convict the kid.  A conviction will mean the death penalty.  Acquittal means putting a potentially dangerous teenager from the bad part of town back on the streets.  11 of the 12 jurors immediately vote to convict the kid.  But Juror # 8 (Henry Fonda) votes in favor of ""Not Guilty"".  While he isn't convinced that the kid is guilty, he also is not convinced that the defendent is innocent either.  He merely wants to discuss the trial before sending the kid to the electric chair.  He is met with hostility by the other jurors who want to get back to their lives.  But, he keeps at it, and the result is a movie fueled by great dialogue and brilliant acting.

The 12 jurors go over the details of the case, trying to find the truth of the matter.  They discuss the witnesses and whether some things they testified to could be exaggerated.  They bicker at each other about personal bias and each other's motives.  By the end, each juror will find themselves questioning what they once believed to be fact, and they reevaluate some prior prejudices.

While Fonda definitely carries the movie, the other 11 men do extremely well in their supporting roles.  Ed Begely and Lee J. Cobb are great as the two ignorant men who want to put the kid to death no matter what, while John Fielder (the voice of Piglet in Disney's Winne the Pooh films) is great as the timid banker who tends to get pushed around by the other jurors.  Also, Jack Warden does a great job as the juror who will do anything to get out as soon as possible in order to get to a ballgame.

1397300,5,B000056HEC,"How many times have you seen the ""One Juror Holdout"" theme played out in movies and (especially) on TV shows? Probably quite a few. But none done quite so well and so very convincingly as 1957's wonderful ""12 Angry Men"".

This black-and-white classic court drama was directed by Sidney Lumet and co-produced by one its star actors, Henry Fonda. The film premiered in movie theaters on April 13th, 1957.

This was Sidney Lumet's very first feature film as a director. He had only directed television programs up until ""12 Angry Men"". Lumet's first theatrical effort turned out to be a very good one indeed, belying its low budget and short three-week shooting schedule.

Did you know ..... That ""12 Angry Men"" was originally written for a TV program? The teleplay version was aired in 1954, as an episode of the TV series ""Studio One"".

The film was remade in 1997 (as a Made-for-Cable-TV movie), with Jack Lemmon starring in the Henry Fonda role. In many scenes, that newer version is pretty much a word-for-word duplication of the '57 film. The '97 version is OK, too. But the original is superior overall (IMO), with better jury-room atmosphere and that certain 1950s-period detail and aura that could never be replicated in later decades. William Friedkin (one of my favorite movie directors) directed the '97 version of ""Angry Men"". I hadn't realized that Friedkin was involved in the remake until doing some research for this Amazon review.

The '57 version of ""Angry Men"" earned three Oscar nominations, including one for ""Best Picture"" of the year (it lost out to ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"").

Henry Fonda stars in the film as ""Juror #8"". Fonda's arguments, as he attempts to persuade his fellow jurors of the defendant's ""possible"" but by no means ""certain"" innocence, play out exceptionally well in this film. This is due in no small part to Fonda's fine performance. Each of his eleven fellow actors (jurors), to a man, do quite nicely in their respective parts as well.

Very nearly all of this 96-minute film was shot in the ""jury room"", a perfectly natural setting for the movie considering the subject matter, of course. From what I've read, an actual jury room was used to shoot ""12 Angry Men"", which further enhances the gritty, realistic look of this B&W classic. The old-time jury quarters come complete with high ceiling and big (sticky) windows. Another realistic touch was the rickety and troublesome electric fan that juror Jack Warden just can't seem to get started (until the light switch is flipped on).

We get to see outside of that confining 16x24-foot jury room for only a very few minutes -- at the beginning and end of the movie. Those brief scenes include a nicely-done courtroom segment which depicts the trial's judge (portrayed by Rudy Bond) giving the jury the appropriate instructions before turning the murder case over to them. Note the bland, banal, and seemingly-uncaring manner in which the judge issues his instructions to the jury. I thought this was a good piece of writing here -- to have the judge, at the end of another long day in the sweltering non-air-conditioned courtroom, speak to the jury in a rather detached way. It's obvious that this judge has given out these exact same instructions many times prior to this trial. It's become merely ""routine"", and his robotic-like words are telling us that he could probably say this stuff in his sleep.

After the jury files into the back room, we get our only look at the defendant in this murder trial -- a young 18-year-old Hispanic boy who is accused of knifing his father to death late one night. The boy glances at the jurors as they leave the courtroom; and it's hard at that early point in the film to not feel some compassion and sympathy for this young man whose life is in the hands of the twelve men he just watched leave the room. It's another fine piece of (silent) writing here, to give the audience one brief look at the person whom the film's story is really all about. The young defendant, played by John Savoca, never says a word here, and never utters a sound, but he says a lot with just his facial expressions during those few short seconds he's on camera.

Very little music accompanies this movie (besides the low-key theme that plays under the opening credits and some additional music at the end of the picture). I'm guessing that Mr. Lumet was of the opinion that the tension in the jury room was ample enough to propel the film forward, and that a minimal amount of music was required. I think that's correct too.

The cast here is comprised of all men. Not a woman juror to be found. Even the two ""alternate"" jurors who were dismissed at the start of the picture are men (we get a brief glimpse of those two male alternates in one shot during the short courtroom scene).

I think it might have been interesting if one or two female jurors had been inserted into this Reginald Rose screenplay. But it was decided to go with an all-male jury instead. And I certainly can't fault the results. It's a film that works extremely well, despite the cliched premise (i.e., ""11 vs. 1 in a jury room"").

Screen time is divided up pretty evenly between the ""Twelve Angry Men"" throughout the film. And each and every one of these twelve actors is worth watching here. They're all very good. If the words ""top-notch ensemble cast"" ever applied to a motion picture, that phrase certainly would adequately describe this film's troupe of actors.

It's a cast filled with familiar faces (or soon-to-be-familiar faces, from a ""circa 1957"" perspective). As I look over this cast of 12, I'm reminded of something from a TV fan's standpoint .... and that is the connection between 8 of these 12 actors and one of the best-written television series ever aired, ""The Fugitive"" (which ran from 1963 to 1967). Eight of these ""jurors"" made guest appearances on ""The Fugitive"", some of them appearing in multiple episodes of that TV show.

The majority of this ""angry dozen"" also showed up on lots of other TV programs in the years following the release of this film -- including many episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"", which (like ""The Fugitive"") proved to be a familiar stomping ground for several of these actors, with five of them logging guest appearances on that Rod Serling-created anthology program.

Here's a rundown of the film's exceptional cast (complete with some random chunks of miscellaneous info and bio data re. each of these ""jurors""):

""Juror #1"" (The Jury Foreman) -- Played by 37-year-old Martin Balsam. .... Martin was one of the last ""holdouts"" in the film, changing his vote from Guilty to Not Guilty quite late in the movie. .... Martin is possibly best-known for his part as ""Detective Milton Arbogast"" in 1960's ""Psycho"". His ""meeting"" with ""Mother"" on the stairs is a memorable scene in that Hitchcock shocker. .... Balsam passed away of a heart attack in February 1996. He was 76.

""Juror #2"" -- John Fiedler. .... John was the youngest of the twelve jurors (at age 32), besting Robert Webber for this ""youngest"" honor by just four months. .... Fiedler made scads of TV guest-starring appearances, including his memorable recurring role as ""Mr. Peterson"" in ""The Bob Newhart Show"" during the 1970s. .... He was also famous for providing voices for cartoon characters. .... The Wisconsin-born Fiedler died, at the age of 80, in June 2005.

""Juror #3"" -- Lee J. Cobb (age 45). .... A distinguished film actor (""The Exorcist""; ""The Three Faces Of Eve""; ""The Dark Past""), Cobb was the very last ""Angry"" juror to have his vote swayed. His emotion-filled breakdown at the end of the film put a cap on the roller-coaster ride of feelings he exhibits throughout the movie. An extra nice touch is when Henry Fonda's character helps Cobb on with his jacket after all the other jurors have left the room. Fonda shows his compassion toward Cobb here, despite the violent outbursts Cobb aimed at Fonda earlier. A nice finishing touch of humanity here. .... Cobb was 64 when he passed away in 1976.

""Juror #4"" -- E.G. Marshall (42 years old). .... Marshall acted in dozens of movies and made over 130 TV appearances (mostly in the early days of the medium). .... Was born in Minnesota in 1914. Died in 1998.

""Juror #5"" -- Jack Klugman (34 years of age during filming) -- Famous for his TV characters (""Oscar Madison"" and ""Quincy""), Jack's acting career began in the very earliest days of television (in 1950). .... Klugman is also remembered fondly by this writer for his parts in the TV series ""The Twilight Zone"". .... Klugman, like two of his jury-mates, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the other two Philly-born actors in the cast being Ed Binns and Joe Sweeney).

""Juror #6"" -- Edward Binns. .... There's a nifty little ""connection"" between Binns and Henry Fonda (besides this picture) -- i.e., both appeared in the 1964 film ""Fail-Safe"" as well (""Grady, this is the President!!""). Binns was playing bomber pilot ""Grady"" when he was being screamed at by ""President"" Fonda. Another ""Fail-Safe""/""12 Angry Men"" tie-in is the fact that Sidney Lumet directed both movies. .... Ed Binns passed on in December of 1990 (when he was 74). He was 40 when he played ""Juror Number Six"".

""Juror #7"" -- Jack Warden. .... Jack provides most of the comic relief in this movie. He gets in several zingers at the expense of Baltimore Orioles' baseball fan Jack Klugman -- ""Baltimore? What have they got, except good groundskeeping?"" -- ""And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits wherever we look!"". .... Warden was 36 in early 1957 when ""Angry Men"" was filmed. .... Jack's acting career, in both TV and in the movies, extends back to 1951.

""Juror #8"" -- Henry Fonda. .... The most recognized name in the cast, Fonda was 51 when he made ""12 Angry Men"". .... Henry was famous for his many highly-memorable big-screen roles, in such films as ""Mister Roberts"", ""The Grapes Of Wrath"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", and ""On Golden Pond"". .... I'm also very partial to Fonda's performance in ""Fail-Safe"", in which (as mentioned previously) he portrayed the President of the United States. .... Henry Fonda left behind a legion of faithful fans and a legendary roster of film roles when he died on August 12th, 1982, at the age of 77.

""Juror #9"" -- Joseph Sweeney. .... Sweeney was the oldest (72) and one of the most likeable of the 12 jurors in the film. .... Joe was one of only two jurors whose name was revealed in the movie (Mr. ""McCardle""). .... Sweeney only made six movies, with ""12 Angry Men"" being his last. His first film was a 1918 silent flick called ""Sylvia On A Spree"". .... The 79-year-old Sweeney passed away on November 25, 1963 (the very same day that America buried its assassinated President, John F. Kennedy).

""Juror #10"" -- Ed Begley (Sr.). .... Begley, 56, played the bigoted ""Juror Number Ten"", whose ""Not Guilty"" vote does not come without a vigorous fight (""Ya know what I mean?""). .... I've always liked this guy in everything I've seen him in, from Barbara Stanwyck's father in the screen version of the famous radio play ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" (1948), to ""Patterns"" (both the TV version in 1955 and the film adaption the following year), to a skillful performance in ""The Fugitive"" in 1964, to his very funny part as a court judge in a 1965 episode of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (""Mr. Petrie, is it your intention to go through the ENTIRE alphabet?!"" LOL!). .... Ed Begley, in April 1970, died at the age of 69.

""Juror #11"" -- 51-year-old George Voskovec. .... The Austrian-born Voskovec was the only juror (actor) who was not a native of the United States. .... His lineup of credits includes several movie parts and better than fifty TV roles. .... Date of death: July 1, 1981 (age 76).

""Juror #12"" -- Robert Webber (age 32). .... Like many of these other actors, Webber's list of TV acting credits is about a mile long. Just prior to his death (of Lou Gehrig's Disease) in 1989, Robert had been a regular in the TV series ""Moonlighting"". .... He was also a common sight in 1970s-era television crime dramas.

THE DOPE ON THIS DVD...........

""MGM Home Entertainment, Inc."" placed this DVD on the home-video market on March 6th, 2001. ""12 Angry Men"" is part of MGM's ""Vintage Classics"" series of DVDs.

The disc sports a very-pleasing Widescreen (1.66:1) image and two Dolby Digital audio soundtracks (English 2.0 Mono and French 2.0 Mono). It's not an Anamorphic video transfer we see here, but picture detail looks excellent nonetheless. Very little to complain about, IMO. French and Spanish subtitles are on the disc, too.

The Original Theatrical Trailer for ""12 Angry Men"" is the lone bonus supplement offered up on the disc. Run time for the trailer is 2:13. As with many trailers of this era, watch for the ""alternate"" takes of scenes (which are not quite the same as what end up on screen in the final cut of the movie). Lee Cobb's ""fuming tirade"" scene, for instance, is a different ""take"" than the one in the finished film, with some extra (snarling) dialogue added as well.

I get a kick out of old trailers. And while this one for ""12 Angry Men"" doesn't include the melodramatic screen-filling written passages that some (even older) movie trailers contain, the narration we find here has that same 'overdone' effect. An example being when this completely-inaccurate narration is heard in the trailer: ""Twelve men turned into twelve clawing animals!"" ... Huh?? 12 clawing animals? This is not true at all. Only one of the jurors would even remotely fit that description (Cobb).

The overly-dramatic music used for the trailer is not to be found in the movie itself either. Fun-to-watch stuff though.

The DVD Menus are quiet and static in nature. Four choices are available from the disc's Main Menu screen -- ""Play""; ""Scene Selections"" (four Menu screens used for the movie's 16 chapters); ""Theatrical Trailer""; and ""Languages"".

No paper insert is included.

I'd also like to point out a mistake in the movie description that is found on the back of the DVD case. For some reason the author of that descriptive blurb claims: ""Eleven jurors are convinced that the defendant is guilty of murder. The twelfth has no doubt of his innocence"".

The above passage is not accurate. The 12th juror referred to there (Fonda) is not at all completely convinced of the defendant's innocence. Fonda's character (revealed as ""Mr. Davis"" in the final reel) states numerous times during the movie that he ""isn't sure"" if the boy is guilty or innocent. In fact, he says ""I don't know"" when asked point-blank by a fellow juror ""Do you really think he's innocent?"". So, I just wanted to point out this erroneous info being given to unaware DVD buyers who might take the package's blurb to heart. Certainly not an Earth-shaking error, but still worth pointing out.

There's another minor error on the packaging as well. The box claims that the film received ""four"" Academy Award nominations...which is wrong. It received three.

To close this ""Angry"" dissertation ;) .........

""12 Angry Men"" has been one of my favorite motion pictures for a long time now. It's certainly one of the best-written and competently-acted dramas of its kind ever produced. And this sparkling-looking DVD edition only makes me want to revisit this film all the more. And I'll bet that the odds are 11-to-1 in favor of other DVD owners feeling that same way after viewing this Digital Disc.

Pretty good odds, huh? (Or are they?) ~wink~",1130976000,24,15453,4.769749157618869
1397301,4,B000056HEC,"Through the high drama of the deliberations of the jury on a slum kid's murder trial, this surprisingly intense film illustrates how the American court system helps protect individual rights through objective law, while at the same time glorifying heroic individualism through Henry Fonda's character, at first the sole juror to hold out for reasonable doubt.

All twelve jurors are perfectly--i.e., intriguingly yet consistently--characterized.  The plotting is masterful, as key points are revealed at a suspenseful yet breathtaking pace.  Throughout the deliberation, inconsistencies in the case are subtly revealed so that the viewer can arrive at some of them before the jurors get to them.  The only flaw is that, probably in an attempt to maintain suspense, the key point casting doubt on the testimony of the key witness is not available to the audience until the last moment so that it sort of comes out of nowhere, unfortunately having the opposite effect on the suspense of the film's climax.  It might have helped if they had shown the key testimony during the trial itself for the first five minutes or so of the film.  Nevertheless, it's amazing how much drama and tension they manage to put into a film that's essentially just twelve men sitting in a small room talking for an hour and a half.

The Ox-Bow Incident, also starring Fonda, makes an excellent companion piece to this film, as it shows the importance to the protection of individual rights of objective law from a negative perspective (i.e., it more directly shows the evil of anarchy and mob rule).",1130112000,6,1576,5.015325670498084
1397302,5,B000056HEC,"I've been watching a whole bunch of Sidney Lumet films lately and I got to tell you: 12 ANGRY MEN, although being his ""debut"" attempt, is also one of his finest.  It is one of the finest courtroom thrillers ever filmed.  Part of the reason I enjoyed it so much has to do with its setup: rather than drag us through courtroom drama, the film decides to begin its tale with the judge issuing orders to the jury.  We do not know the facts of the case; we have not seen the swaggering attorneys battling it out; we only get a glimpse of the defendant before following our twelve stars into the jury room.  Thus, the film does not distract us with the courtroom antics.  Instead, we get the feeling that the trial must have been a quick one.  The defendant appears guilty to everyone.  Except, of course, to one jury member (Henry Fonda)-a man who seems to be the only one who has given the case any ""real"" thought.

12 ANGRY MEN really exploits the ignorance of the audience to its advantage.  As the jurors battle out the facts of the case, we slowly come to understand what crime has been committed until we feel as if we have the whole picture.  This ""discovery"" process keeps the audience actively involved.  In fact, we feel like a 13th jury member.  Lumet's camera work, additionally, aids this story.  We begin as a fly on the wall, above the jury members (at a distance).  But as the film winds up and becomes more and more intense, we slowly begin to tighten in on the jury members, moving from wide-angle shots to tight ""zoom"" shots.  The effect that Lumet manages to create is one of tension.  Merely by his choice of camera shots (and lenses) he is able to slowly bring the audience to a boil as we begin to feel more and more confined by the claustrophobic jury room.  It is an amazing effect and one that completely involves the audience in the film.

Moreover, the acting in 12 ANGRY MEN is superb.  And why shouldn't it be?  The script and storyline are a launching pad for good performances.  Take twelve interesting, complex characters, employ twelve of the best character actors in town, and place them in a one-setting performance in which the film depends upon these twelve men for everything.  You will enjoy 12 ANGRY MEN.  It is a great story that is told in a masterful way.  In its wake, I just don't think any movie can focus upon the ""jury"" in the same way.  This film leaves much too big of an impact for that.",1129420800,4,2434,4.403587443946188
1397303,5,B000056HEC,"amazingly this was the great sydney lumet's directorial debut.this is a great film that epitomizes perfection and deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made.i've never seen another film ever showing the jury process before and this one does just that.the entire film,with the exception of the very beginning and very end,takes place in the jury room.once they go to the men's room for a couple of minutes but otherwise the bulk is in this one particular room,creating a bit of claustrophobia.the building isn't air conditioned and the rooms fan doesn't work,both adding extra tension.than comes to voting for the 18yr. old puerto rican kid who stands trial for murdering his father.if they find him guilty than he will be sentenced to death.before the vote we get to learn about each of the 12 jurors.there's a hot-head who hasn't spoken to his son in 2 years,there's one who has a cold,another is self involved,another has tickets to that nights baseball game,another seems to be passive,there's an old man, another who seems to be a perfectionist, and there's a latino.the rest can go either way.they all vote guilty except for one and the story takes off from there.a great cast,all are great.henry fonda believed in this film so much that he put up $350,000 of his own money to see it get made,seeing as how noone wanted to touch it-big suprise.how unfortunate it is that even back than movie studio executives only thought of profits instead of integrity and vision.fortunately today there are independent companies out there putting out films.you might have to put a little effort into finding out about them,but as this film shows,it definitely is worth it.give me a 100 more films like this over another ""fast and the furious"" any day.if you can be entertained with films without having to see explosions,car chases and people getting shot to death than this film is a must-see.",1128988800,2,1908,4.928571428571429
1397304,5,B000056HEC,"What a great film.

""Twelve Angry Men"" tells the story of twelve jurors selected to decide the fate of a young man accused of murder.  At the start of the film, everyone but one of the jurors in convinced of the young man's guilt.  But the sole juror refuse to budge until he's gotten the other jurors to at least consider that the young man really MIGHT be innocent.

Almost the entire black-and-white movie takes place in a small room around a table, and is obviously based on a play.  However, the story and the dialogue are so suspenseful, and the themes of guilt and innocence and judgement so skillfully explored, that the movie never feels long or boring.

And the end--the end is a classic, every moment of it.  You will finish it feeling great.

This is one of my very favorite movies, and I would recommend it to almost anyone.  To anyone cool, anyway.  You're cool, right?

It shows that you don't need car chases or sex appeal or anything beside a room and some people to absolutely saturate a film with suspense and tension.  The characters are fully realized, and their interaction is better than real life.

Do yourself a favor and watch it immediately.",1128643200,,1168,4.5576923076923075
1397315,5,B000056HEC,"Sidney Lumet makes a film from a script that essentially remains a radio play. Any criticism of this film will say that you can essentially hear it without watching it and you'll still get most of the information you need to understand the story. The film at times film like a real-time recording of a process and in a reality-TV society this feeling will be more immediate for today's viewers.

That may be true. But the strength of this film is that its filmic touches are so subtle as to be almost invisible and yet entirely successful. The occasional twitch of a nervous eye, the single drop of sweat on a calm forehead, the perceived pressure of walls closing in on the 12 anonymous characters.

CONTAINS SPOILERS:

In terms of story the whole concept is quite straightforward. 12 jurors are called in to decide on an 'open and shut' case of a young adult of unidentified ethnic origin. 11 of them start off convinced he's guilty and are confronted by the doubts of the only one of them who is not so certain the case is open and shut.

In the process of the discussion imposed by the single doubter they confront the natural concept of justice, the consitutional concept of burden of proof and social realities such as group prejudice, poverty and racial profiling.

The film remains oddly impartial and we are not quite sure who is 'wrong' or 'right' as such. It may very well be that the final verdict of not guilty liberated a patricidal murdered. The only encouragement we are given by the juror who leads the doubters is that ""it's possible"" the boy is really guilty. But it's also possible he isn't and the prospect of putting an innocent man to death is even more horrifying.

Perhaps a contemporary American audience should think about the viability of the death penalty while watching this film. It is possible for any verdict to be wrong even in a case that may look like an open and shut case: after all ""it's possible the defence lawyer is stupid"", ""it's possible the eye witnesses are wrong"" and it's possible that the jurors selected to judge their peer may be governed by prejudices they are not themselves aware of.",1127692800,2,2137,4.62532981530343

Yes, the majority of this film flows by in near 'real time.'  In other words, this movie draws you right in by making you feel like you are there for every second of the deliberation.

Fonda has never been better as the voice of reason, and his fellow jurors are played by some of the best character actors of the day, including Jack Warden, E.G Marshall, Martin Balsam, and Jack Klugman. Finally, as Fonda's nemesis, Cobb projects the savage fury of a man too often wronged, a victim of his own blinding ignorance. A big triumph made on a small budget.",1125878400,,455,4.62962962962963
1397318,5,B000056HEC,"""12 Angry Men"" is worthy of an all-star cast led by Henry Fonda, who also produced this 1957 classic.

It is the powerful story of 12 angry men inside a jury room deliberating on the fate of a teenager accused of murdering his father in cold blood.  A kid who has been in nothing but trouble with about nothing to live for.

Henry Fonda plays a juror who from the very beginning that the kid in question could not have committed the murder because of the circumstances involved but not before trying to convince his fellow jurors with reenactments and surprise facts.

Led by Henry Fonda, who is then followed by some of the following: Ed Begley, Joseph Sweeney, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Webber, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, et al.

Particularly of the angry repartee between Fonda and Cobb make for explosive drama.",1124064000,,838,4.673469387755102
1397319,5,B000056HEC,"Always keep in mind that the verdict could easily go the other way. Instead of one juror sewing the seed of reasonable doubt, as Henry Fonda does here, a lone holdout for guilty might well convince the other jurors to convict. That's the genius of the teleplay, screenplay and play by Reginald Rose. His courtroom drama has traveled expertly from television to motion picture to live theatre, where a 2004-05 Broadway revival earned critical acclaim. Justice seemingly triumphs, but what if our lone holdout isn't in your jury pool? What then? By subtle implication, ""12 Angry Men"" is a disquieting primer on the American jury system.

Fonda, who played variations on this part over a long career, and Rose co-produced this Oscar-nominated film. In his directing debut, Sidney Lumet assembled a dream cast that included Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Jack Klugman. Under his taut direction, their ensemble work is flawless, as is the claustophobic black-and-white cinematography by the great Boris Kaufman. It gets a bit stagey and preachy but not so you notice. If you've ever served on a jury, and Henry Fonda wasn't there, you know how scary the experience can be. So is this provocative film.",1123632000,3,1236,4.971014492753623
1397320,4,B000056HEC,"12 Angry Men is one of those classics that many hear of but never watch.  Sidney Lumet's first major film takes place entirely in a sweaty jury room where Henry Fonda slowly works 11 other jurors around from a snap 'guilty' vote to a more careful consideration of the case.  Bigotry, impatience, age issues, and personal problems all surface.

One star off the top for being a bit stagey and seeming a bit too much like a play turned into a movie.  But otherwise, this is a top film.  Obviously, this is a dialog-centered film, since it never leaves the steamy jury room.  Nonetheless, it is riveting, and grows more engaging, right up to the end, when it resists what must have been a stong temptation to put out excess explanations or some bogus bonhommie.

You can't say too much about the cast.  Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are wonderful and totally credible, but so are jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, and others.  The 12 jurors are almost a police line-up of best male dramatic actors of the era.

The film seems a tad dated now, but in a good way--I found myself wishing the jury system was actually that good and that modern jurors weren't chosen based on being too witless to evade community service.

1397321,5,B000056HEC,"First of all, ""12 Angry Men"" shouldn't really be considered a courtroom drama. It does not even show a courtroom in it. Its lone setting is dimly lit juryroom, where 12 jurors are about to decide the fate of a young man accused of murdering his father. 11 of them are convinced that he killed him are itching to fry him. But there is one juror out to prove him, who is willing to reexamine every testimony, every piece of evidence involved in the case.

That man is Henry Fonda, who gives quite possibly the greatest performance of his career in this powerful piece of cinematic excellence. As the one man who is out to save a young man from having his life cut short by a stubborn panel of ordinary working class men (played with finesse by actors such as E.G. Daily, Jack Klugman, Martin Balsam and of course Lee J. Cobb), Fonda's character (none of them have names) skillfully examines each piece of evidence, and one by one, Fonda convinces each member of the jury to go along with him, climaxing in Lee. J.

Watching these superb actors, led by Henry Fonda, interact in a small, convincingly hot room for virtually the entire running time of the movie almost feels like a privilege.  Some details jar -- an all-male jury, the cigarette smoking, of course, and the fact that the sweat stains on Martin Balsam's shirt seem to disappear the longer he stays in the room -- but the transcendent issues and the film's ambitions overwhelm those dated moments, all the more so in this age where the civilizing impact of doubt about the rightness of one's own views and motives has all but disappeared.  Henry Fonda may well have led his jury colleagues to free a guilty man and one of the small beauties of Lumet's film is that Fonda wrestles with that reality from the first moment he raises his doubts.  Script, issues, intelligence, direction, and acting -- they all come together in Men, without a single scene of graphic violence, without a single whiz-bang special effect.  Lumet may have equalled his work here on a couple of occasions in his long career (The Pawnbroker and Serpico come to mind) but his rookie directorial debut was a first time grand slam.",1118016000,2,1190,4.757281553398058

After a trial of a teenage boy accused of murdering his father is completed, the case is handed over to the jury to decide if the boy is innocent or guilty.  All of the jury members think he is guilty except one, Juror #8.  Can he convince the other jury members that maybe this boy is innocent even though all the evidence points to his guilt?  This movie is almost completely different from any other movie of the 60's or now in 2005.  The whole movie takes place in a hot, smoky room as the jury debates the boy's guilt.  Besides for a brief intro and outro, the whole movie is in one room.  What makes this possible is the tight, snappy dialogue throughout the movie.  For a movie that could have been deathly slow, the dialogue and cinematography gives it a breakneck speed as the jury argues back and forth.  Classic movie and highly recommended.

  Henry Fonda stars as Juror #8, the one jury member who believes the teenage boy may be innocent of the crime he's accused of.  It is a pleasure to watch Fonda slowly convince the rest of the jury about the idea of ""reasonable doubt.""

1397325,4,B000056HEC,"It was a curiosity piece even back in its day, a trying time for the movie industry when the studio moguls were trying desperately to compete with TV any way they could think of.  If huge screens and stereophonic sound couldn't put those asses into the seats, then maybe actual rip offs of already aired TV programs might.  (We see this same thinking today with studio remakes of such old TV series as BEWITCHED, SWAT, THE MOD SQUAD, DUKES OF HAZZARD, really anything that is remembered fondly).  Here they sent in TV director par excellence Sidney Lumet, with a limited budget, to film Reginald Rose's controversial teleplay he called ""TWELVE ANGRY MEN.""  They gave him one bona fide movie star and for the rest of the parts they hired a bunch of so called ""character actors"" including Broadway's own Lee J. Cobb, a man tormented by the role he had played in the McCarthy Era, when to save his own skin he had named name after name to anti-Communist inquisitors and ruined countless careers.  When he sweats in this movie you can see the guilt streaming from his pores, it's almost as though you can touch your finger to the screen and it woild be wet.

The movie wasn't an overwhelming box office hit, but it had its partisans, and it launched Lumet's career as a reliable film director who could bring projects in on time AND work well with ""difficult"" talent.  When we watch the show today we see the faults in the play's mise-en-scene, but we note the skill with which Lumet puts the cast through their paces and manages to bring some variety in his endless re-stagings of conversations between angelic Fonda and the all-too-human rest of them.

As other reviewers have noticed, if it was today, one of the jurors would have early on beaten Fonda to a pulp and had a mistrial called.  Especially if, like Ed Begley, they had tickets to an important ball game they didn't want to miss.",1112745600,2,1889,4.598214285714286
1397326,5,B000056HEC,"One of the best character studies ever filmed is ""Twelve Angry Men,"" written by Reginald Rose and directed by the great Sidney Lumet.  An eighteen-year-old boy is accused of killing his brutal father.  On the hottest day of the year, eleven men file into a stifling jury room convinced that this is an open and shut case; the boy obviously did it.  They are all anxious to go home as quickly as possible.

The one dissenting voice is juror number 8, a thoughtful individual with a conscience.  He doesn't know whether the accused murdered his father or not, but he thinks that it is the jurors' duty to carefully examine the facts before condemning the young man to death.  Can they be absolutely sure that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?  The other jurors, with great reluctance, agree to discuss the details of the case.

As they deliberate,  the jurors reveal their frustrations, hopes, disappointments, and prejudices.  Every part in this film is perfectly cast.  Lee J. Cobb is a standout as a man who is estranged from his son and who wants all ungrateful children to pay for their sins.  Ed Begley is juror number 10, a vicious individual who proudly parades his bigotry before his fellow jurors.  Joseph Sweeney, juror number 9, is the oldest of the twelve.  When juror number 8 starts making some good points, the old man is quick to acknowledge that there may be more to this case than meets the eye.  Also noteworthy is E. G. Marshall as juror number 4, a low-key and dispassionate individual who never seems to sweat, no matter how overheated the jury room becomes.  Henry Fonda, in one of his finest roles, is the embodiment of integrity, courage, and compassion.

Certain aspects of this film are dated, particularly the hokey music which is jarring to the modern ear.  However, the give and take between the men is mesmerizing, and the questions raised are still valid today.  How can twelve ordinary people effectively separate fact from fiction?  How much time and effort should the jurors expend before they bring in their verdict?  If they are not one hundred percent sure that the defendant committed the crime, should the jurors let him go free?

Since this movie was filmed in 1957, there was no DNA testing or detailed forensic evidence to consider.  With juror number 8 leading the way, the men consider the credibility of the eyewitness testimony, the behavior of the accused after the crime, and even the methodology of using a switchblade knife.  Soon, disagreements erupt; the jurors start shouting at one another and they nearly come to blows.

""Twelve Angry Men"" is about one individual's ability to stand up for what he believes, even when others ridicule him.  It is also a powerful study not just of our criminal justice system, but also of the diversity of human experience, the nature of peer pressure, and the difficulty of ever fully knowing the truth.",1110067200,3,2908,4.789156626506024

Practically the entire film is set in the single jury room, on a hot and humid day, with these twelve incredibly diverse men, and shows how their backgrounds color how they arrive at their conclusions. Truth is very elusive in this case, and it's a matter of questioning if there is ""reasonable doubt.""

There are many things that point out how times have changed in 50 years; it has been decades since a jury would be chosen that would only consist of white men, and a few years since a table full of ashtrays with cigarette butts would be allowed, but the basic truths remain the same, and if one places twelve strangers to come to a verdict in a difficult case, tempers are going to flare. The hot head in this film is Juror # 3, Lee J. Cobb, who sees the events through the lens of his relationship with his son, and he gives a fiery performance, but each actor has a lot to contribute to the success of this film.
This was the first feature film in Sidney Lumet's long career, and he was nominated for a Best Director Oscar; the film was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, but lost in all three categories to David Lean's ""Bridge on the River Kwai."" Lumet was to work with Fonda again in '64 with the riveting cold war thriller (and my favorite Lumet film) ""Fail-Safe,"" which also had in its cast Juror # 6, Ed Binns.

1397330,4,B000056HEC,"I recently saw this movie for the first time and I was impressed.  It is has the appearance of a fine stage play brought to the screen.  It has a powerful script, excellent direction, and 12 outstanding actors playing an intentionally diverse group of jury members.  It had all of the makings of a ""5 Star"" except for the ending.

""12 Angry Men"" is the story of 12 jurors that meet to decide the fate of a man tried for murder.  They meet with the impression that it is a simple matter given the evidence that they have heard; an eyewitness, a person below the apartment who heard the person threaten to kill the victim, the murder weapon that he claimed to have lost, as well as a few other significant bits of evidence.  As they prepare to issue their decision, a member of the jury suggests that maybe they not act so quickly.  It's a hot day in a hot room and everyone wants to go home, back to work, or to the ballgame.  No one, except one, seems interested in ""wasting"" time discussing the evidence.  No need to itemize what happens next.  This is the story of how one man can make a difference.  It is also a story of how we distort our reasoning with our prejudices.  The alleged perpetrator, you see, is from a minority and we see that this was reason enough for some to believe his guilt.  As the lone man begins to gather support, we all start to see things through a different perspective.  A strong element of the movie is the diversity of the characters.  I bet most people know someone who would fit about every one of the personalities profiled.  The actors all deserve a near-equal credit for bringing such vivid life to their roles.  My problem was the last two converts (you saw this coming didn't you?).  I'll be glad to watch this movie again but I could not detect and sound reason why the last two changed their verdict.  I think it had to do with the need to wrap things up more than anything else.

The movie is a bit dated in my opinion.  The element of prejudice is very strong in this movie out of the 1950's.  It may have been right on track for its' time.  Today it looks anachronistic.  I may be wrong but my impression is that the OJ Simpson verdict showed us that it was money, not race, that determines the outcome.  There are many legal issues that are raised but not thoroughly discussed.  That's to be expected given the time constraints of the standard length of a movie.  However, it enables the writer to present debatable issues in a one-sided perspective.  For some, the writer (Reginald Rose) may be right on the money.  For others, there may be a tendency to call out, ""Now wait a minute!"".  Whatever the case may be for you, I will say that I found this movie to be one that gripped my attention and held it to the very end.  It's failure to finish strong cost it in my ratings scheme.

1397332,5,B000056HEC,"A record hot day and a man's life is at stake as he is about to be sentenced to death by 12 jurors from various backgrounds.  These 12 jurors, all men, represent Caucasian America of the 1950s, and the values within the American fabric.  The 12 men are all assembled in a small conference room after the trial where they should all agree upon the man's guilt or innocence.  Juror No. 3 (Lee J. Cobb) spits out that it is an open and shut case as the man is obviously guilty as the jurors sit down to discuss the man's guilt.  The only person that seems to disagree is Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda), who feels that the man might not be guilty after all.

The battle of persuasion begins as the majority of the group tempts to pressure Juror No. 8 into submission as they all want to leave the hot room without a fan and return to their daily tasks.  However, Juror No. 8 believes that when a man's life is at stake, one should take more than a few minutes to ponder the guilt as they could be wrong.  This notion is exactly what the film wants to depict as it becomes a lesson of the Constitution and people's right to a fair trial.

12 Angry Men takes place in the small conference room where the audience is to be enlightened about the characters and their values.  As the story unfolds it becomes apparent that the values of the jurors' influence their decision making.  The decision of sentencing a man to death will be a reflection of their own background, education, and upbringing.  In essence, the decision is a reflection of each juror.  This decision making is drawn into the light through lengthy discussions based on their personal notions.  This means that the audience is presented with meticulously brilliant character study.

Sidney Lumet directs a brilliant post-courtroom drama, which is supported by an excellent script.  The cast carries the script to higher grounds as the cast's performance is outstanding.  The cast consists of talented actors such as Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, Henry Fonda, and Lee J. Cobb.

The cinematography enhances the hot claustrophobic atmosphere in the conference room, which pushes the film to the top.  For example, the camera is being held with a slight superior angle in the beginning which progressively moves to an inferior angle toward the end. This intensifies the claustrophobic atmosphere as the ceiling is being observed within the shot with constant use a closed shot.  The slow movement of the camera into an inferior angle also augments the importance of the characters, which is essential as character traits are a dominant part of the film.

In the end, the audience will have received an important political story of people's rights in a democracy, which will offer much to ponder.  The film also offers a terrific character study as the many jurors' decisions will reflect upon their character.  Lastly, 12 Angry Men offers a solid introduction into film making as it displays brilliant use of the camera, mise-en-scene, and performances in front of a camera, which comprises a complete and brilliant cinematic experience.",1099008000,4,3100,4.787593984962406

This film should be seen by all of us, especially those in the younger generations, as it's themes and motives still ring true... even some 47 years after it was released.

The film's all-star cast ignite the storyline with 12 completely different attitudes and personalities.  The banter and the expressions, the calmness and the rage, the outbursts and the silences, the joy and the shame.. all of these combine for a litteral tour-de-force that, in today's world, would require explosions, aliens, and nudity to achieve the same results.  Do not be fooled by the simplistic nature of this film.. yes, it's twelve guys sitting around talking... yes, there is (for nearly 100% of the movie) only one setting... but to say that it is boring, or outdated, is a crime.

1397350,5,B000056HEC,"""That cause is strong which has not a multitude, but one strong man behind it."" (James Russell Lowell)

 Henry Fonda is that one strong man in this absolutely riveting drama that unfolds in one single room where 12 jurors - the ""12 angry men"" of the title - are assembled to decide on the fate of a teenager accused of having murdered his father. At the outset, 11 jurors, for various reasons, are in favour of the verdict of ""guilty"", the lone dissenting voice being Fonda's, who believes there is enough room for doubt regarding the boy's guilt to warrant a verdict of ""not guilty"".

 The ""facts"" of the case are few and simple, and the logic by which Fonda and - in due course of time - other members of the jury unravel the supposed indisputability of those facts is also simple. What makes this film different and, in my view, important is that it deals with the subject of our implicit prejudices and inappropriate priorities and the way they affect our every judgement. Supposedly ""indisputable facts"" are very often the products of our selective memory, which in turn is dictated and coloured by our prejudices and priorities.

 Take, for instance, the character played by Jack Warden - a man who will go along with any verdict as long as he can catch the baseball game that evening to which he's got tickets. He ""believes"" the boy is guilty only because the majority is in favour of the ""guilty"" verdict. When later the opinion of the majority has turned in favour of the verdict of ""not guilty"", he sees fit to side with the majority not because he now believes there is enough reason to doubt the boy's guilt but only because it will help the jury reach a unanimous decision quicker and enable him to reach the baseball game on time. Warden's priority is baseball, and the fact that a teenager's life is at stake holds less significance for him than watching the game.

 Ed Begley's character believes the boy is guilty because the latter comes from a slum and, according to him, slum-dwellers are all the same - violent, antisocial, dangerous beings genetically inclined to stealing and murdering - and the boy therefore deserves to be condemned to death for the safety of decent society.

 Then there's Lee J. Cobb's character, who lets his own deep personal anguish cloud his reason and prejudice him towards wanting to see the teenager sentenced to death.

 What I gathered from this fascinating film is this: We frequently see, hear and recall events not as they have actually occurred but in a manner that will help fulfill our priorities or reinforce our existing beliefs and prejudices. While making decisions and passing judgements, we often choose to ignore the objective reality and to replace it with our own subjective (and unreliable) interpretations of the same, in order to support those priorities and prejudices.

 This film must rank as one of the greatest and most important films of all time. Henry Fonda's quiet strength and dignity pervade the film, but it is Lee J. Cobb who turns in an astounding performance and steals the show as far as I am concerned.

1397351,5,B000056HEC,"It always pisses me off when people give The Matrix as a philosophical movie, when there are so many much more rich sources of artistic exploration. 12 Angry Men is one such example, a great movie about epistemology.
During an unseen trial, a young man of a negatively-seen ethnicity (which is never specified) is accused of the murder of his father. It is an ""open and shut case"", and all the jurors agree that he is guilty, except juror #8, played by Henry Fonda.
In 95 minutes, almost shot in real-time, we observe as the jurors' prejudices and emotions churn and crash in mighty waves, as each piece of evidence is examined and examined again, as every actor plays against the others. In the process, we witness an object-lesson in epistemology : what is doubt, what is evidence, how do we prove or disprove a proposition, and how people in groups act in group dynamics that sometimes are not conductive to the truth.
Politically speaking, 12 Angry Men is a testimony against juries and capital punishment, but that is not the point of the movie. It is a movie about how we judge events and how we filter the truth. And that's something that you won't get from any action movie.",1083715200,,1182,4.606635071090047

IF you can believe it, the movie (except for the very beginning and end) takes place and was shot in one room. The plot: a realtime jury deliberation for a murder trial where the one man out of 12 who votes 'not guilty' faces that burden of convincing the others that despite how the evidence appears, he is right.
There are a few things that make this film unique (besides the said plot, which is as fascinating on the tenth viewing as it is the first). The cast does a truly marvellous ensemble job as every one of the 12 jurors has their own ideosyncracies and moments that form a brilliant tapestry of emotion and suspense. The direction is perfectly suited for the 'small room' feel. That is, the shots are quite long - panning left, panning right, but staying on the same angle for minutes at a time. The script is also well done, letting each of the 12 personalities collide as we watch them switching their votes back and forth with each new revelation.
A film like this really wouldn't make it today (and there was a modern adaptation a few years ago that despite being good, predictably flopped). Why? The plot is small by today's standards (2 hours of jury deliberation). There are only twelve characters and as for scenery, there is...one room. But that's part of what makes the film so super. The smaller the stage, the bigger the play. I suppose it is 'common wisdom' that successfull films in the '00s need big money, plots, and settings.

The basic plot is a group of men who are placed in a locked room to decide the fate of a young man facing a murder charge.  Beyond a reasonable doubt, this movie shows you what happens behind the closed doors.
This film is ideal in the classroom for facilitating discussion on decision making and group dynamics.  Although you don't hear the legal argument, you hear the pieces of it from the jurors' discussion.  I highly recommend watching this.",1076457600,2,760,4.641791044776119
1397366,5,B000056HEC,"Both the play from which this film was adapted, and this film appeared in the 50s, when America was flying high and the paranoia of McCarthyism was still palpable. TWELVE ANGRY MEN is a clarion call to stop the rush to judgement on individuals based on appearances or flimsy evidence. Henry Fonda, who believed so much in the project that he financed much of it, embodies the cool, unbiased American who doesn't take the easy way of going with the crowd. (Interesting note: none of the jurors are referred to by their names, although Fonda and Sweeney introduce themselves at the end. This anonymity, however, doesn't prevent their individual personalities from coming forward.)

Under Sidney Lumet's meticulous direction, all 12 jurors come to a boiling point in the claustrophobic, pre-air conditioning jury room. And all 12 actors are given their moments to shine several times. To reinforce what everyone else has been saying, Fonda, Cobb, Marshall and Begley are the stand-outs here but they and Lumet are careful not to let anyone steal the show.

Nearly 50 years later, this movie still remains fresh and relevant. It is an important reminder that jury duty is not an excuse to take time off from work, nor should it be viewed as an inconvenience which we should shun. Most of the time the system works, and the system works because 12 people, as Juror No. 11 explains, decide the fate of another citizen based on objective evidence, and, most importantly, they have no stake in the outcome.

1397368,5,B000056HEC,"As clearly illustrated by viewer reviews previous to mine, this is a brilliant example of filmmaking. Not only for the classic theme of courtroom dramas which became an important element in the late 50s followed with WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, ANATOMY OF A MURDER, JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG and many others, but 12 ANGRY MEN clearly dramatizes the elements present behind closed jury room doors.
Picture a scenario: 12 people, complete strangers to each other, different ages, different backgrounds, different values, different personalities, and different occupations are all sitting together in a cramp room seriously lacking of air conditioning on a rainy afternoon. 11 jurors with the exception of Henry Fonda vote guilty immediately. Therein lies the tale.
This is more than film entertainment. It serves as a life's lesson to be learned. Henry Fonda's Juror #8 serves as a charactization of a person who sees different sides to every question, and believes in proper and sheer analysis of the facts before a death sentence of the accused felon is to be determined. His motive is not merely to change their votes, but to get each of them to rethink their hasty convictions. Along the way, each character is slowly but surely beginning to see more in common with themselves with Fonda than meets the eye.
His main opposition consists of Robert Webber as a smug advertising man who thinks of people in terms of percentages, Jack Warden a marmalade salesman who is more concerned about ballgame tickets, Ed Begley as a bitter garage owner who has little or no respect for his fellow man, E.G. Marshall as a stockbroker who is very quick to support the defendant's guilt, yet is unwilling to admit his own conscious guilt in such matters. Finally Lee J. Cobb stars as a gruff, bitter Messenger Service Exchange merchant who is simply determined to have the defendant committed.
There have been many dramatizations and repeat viewers following, but this adaptation remains the very best of all of them - more importantly it should (in my opinion) serve as a model for other films to follow, and a moral to analyze the facts before you know the truth, and never set passions before principles.

The beginning of the movie starts out with the jurors leaving to deliberate, and a single shot of the man whose fate they have to decide on. I normally would have been bored with a film that takes place in a single setting, but the director does an incredible job of presenting the different characters, and brings a lot of personality to every one. The viewer begins to understand each of the jurors as the movie progresses, and their reasonings for their verdict.
The other great thing about this filmn, is that none of the facts of the case are presented in the court, and all of the knowledge the viewer has about the case come from the jurors. As they present their arguments, we begin to learn more about what might or might not have happened. At the end of the film, we still don't know what actually happened, which shows that the movie isn't about whether or not the man is guilty or not, but the reasoning and logic that produces the final verdict given by the jurors. The tension in the jury room is amazing and you find yourself siding with certain jurors, almost as if you were actually in the room.

Guess who triumphs in the end?
The ensuing conversations are fascinating. Sidney Lumet had complete mastery even then. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped at work there.
The cast is natural: sweaty, down-to-earth folk putting on their smart hats. You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable. Yet the plot presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant.

A true classic and it shows that even against all odds one person can make a difference.",1060560000,2,468,4.269662921348314
1397375,4,B000056HEC,"When considering a movie like ""12 Angry Men,"" it is difficult to separate a critical perspective from a sociological one.

As a look into the sociology of this demographically similar collection of jurors, the movie is profound. It hits the oft-discussed issues of prejudice based on age, country of origin, economics and education. It came out in 1957, a time when racial unrest was brewing in a way we had never seen, and when fear of people from another country (Russians) was heightened through the bigoted efforts of Joseph McCarthy.

""12 Angry Men"" needed to be made and viewed, but it isn't perfect. The ideas put forth are necessary to discuss, and worthy of response, but it misses the power of ""Inherit the Wind"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""

We are introduced capably to the inner sanctum of the juror room, where decisions are made by ordinary men, each with agendas and biases. This room is where justice happens, or fear prevails, and screenwriter Reginald Rose shows us how fragile justice can be. However, in that fragility, Rose also lets us see the hopeful side of it all, that even the most biased of men is more than his sheer ignorance.

As a movie to be considered for its screenwriting and directing, the criticisms come easier. Though the actors are among the best America has ever had together in one movie, they occasionally come off canned and overscripted. Fonda's soliloquies don't always seem sincere, and this reduces their impact on the audience. He reminds me of a prototypical Phil Donahue, pontificating from a bully pulpit. He even has the pose in one crucial scene where he leans on his leg while standing to make his point.

In fact, as each juror presents his views, the viewer is forced to see not a complex character develop, but a projection of one aspect of American society. It isn't as natural as it could be.

One character who needs highlighting is Jack Klugman. His role as a guy who grew up in the ghetto, but broke out and made good is impressive. He is plausible. He looks like a clean-cut suburban man, but speaks with authority when addressing the others about his background as it relates to the case.

Should you watch it? Absolutely. Watch it with others, especially students, then talk about the film.

1397376,5,B000056HEC,"""12 Angry Men"" is a masterpiece of stage production to film transition.  It is the quintessential one-set, one-act story, where the power of the story and the quality of the acting are so gripping that you never even notice the sparse setting.
Group dynamics are the theme of this story, as leaders emerge, personalities change, and text-book scenarios of group communication unfold.  However, there is no sense of stodgy academia or creative exercise.  It truly is a powerful, edge-of-the-seat type of story.
Unfortunately, the DVD adds little, although with a film this great extras are not needed.  The film looks good, and has aged like a fine wine.",1057017600,6,653,5.018518518518518
1397377,5,B000056HEC,"12 ANGRY MAN is a sophisticated, undoubtedly interesting, clever and exciting film. It's interesting how a court drama can be so full and emotionally charged with no actual trial footage, simply using 12 amazing actors which have wonderful chemistry and a terrific script and directing. it's a must!",1055548800,,299,5.25
1397378,5,B000056HEC,"Now this movie represents everything a classic should be.  Not only was it well directed, it was also very well written and has superb acting.  ""12 Angry Men"" is a great film that never gets boring and never loses its impact.
The story's pretty simple.  The film is about a murder case that accuses a teenager of murdering his father.  The evidence against him is overwhelming.  When it comes to deciding the verdict in the Jury Room, eleven jurors think the boy's ""guilty"" without any hesitation.  There is one, however, who believes there's a chance that the boy is innocent.  It's up to one juror to convince the other eleven of why he believes the way he does in this explosive drama with brains.
I really do consider this a great film.  I liked it when I first saw it in high school, and I like it now in my early twenties.  It has a solid script, breath-taking acting, and an authentic look and feel to it.  Sure, there's some dramatics to it all and some of the dialogue can be wishy-washy at times, but for the most part I think it's pretty solid.
The DVD doesn't have much to offer since it is an old film.  The picture and sound quality is pretty good considering how long ago the film was made.  There is an original theatrical trailer included but that's about it.  It would be nice to see this film get the ""special edition"" treatment and I believe that its time will come.
""12 Angry Men"" is a great film that I really enjoy.  Sure, not everybody's going to like it.  For those who like films with more action in it will most likely want to pass on it.  If you don't like it when a movie takes place in one room for the majority of the time there's a chance you may not be impressed as well.  If you're looking for a classic b&w film with a great script and fabulous acting, I recommend ""12 Angry Men.""  It is something I can watch numerous times.",1054944000,2,1860,4.295977011494253
1397379,4,B000056HEC,12 Angry Men is a great movie in my opinion. It is NOT for everyone. 12 Angry Men is about 12 jury men who decide the fate of an 18 year old boy accused of killing his father.,1052611200,,175,3.6315789473684212
1397380,4,B000056HEC,"Some stage plays translate well to the big screen; the sweaty, claustrophic atmosphere of the jury room works even better on TV.  The vagaries of eye-witness testimony have been handled in better depth elsewhere; the Father Flanagan take on juvenile delinquency is especially dated.  It's an astonishing conceit to probe 12 different personalities in a movie's span. That said,  Henry Fonda's unwavering exploration is most compelling. E.G. Marshall's conversion is pivotal and perfect.  Please suspend belief for a little while; you will be gratified.",1048464000,3,552,5.535714285714286
1397381,5,B000056HEC,"Many times we see a black and white film or read a production date and think, ""That's a picture from a by-gone era"", but ""12 Angry Men"" is as revelant, or moreso, than when it was relased in 1957.  It is also a very educational piece, and in fact I was introduced to it in high school (also a by-gone era).
Children and adults will be educated as they see our system ideally work, as well as unlearn ugly myths about people based upon location, economic status, or age.  It is the kind of film, like a good book, that should be enjoyed as a group or family, and then discussed.
And I thought I'd only like Henry Fonda in ""Yours, Mine, and Ours"".",1048464000,2,645,4.193548387096774
1397382,5,B000056HEC,"To be perfectly honest, the scenario for this movie actually doesn't sound very appealing. A common reaction would be to think - just watching 12 men in a room for the whole movie? How exciting can that be? Well, believe it or not, when the 12 men are impeccably cast, able actors and are given interesting and insightful things to say it can be VERY entertaining.
Additionally, besides managing the seemingly impossible feat of holding the rapt attention of the audience in such a limited setting, 12 Angry Men is an inspirational, perceptive movie with much to say about the power of democracy and our court system.
Anyhow, the basic plot, as indicated earlier, may appear dull - basically the film is about the meeting of a jury in which 11 out of the 12 men, for various reasons later explored, ranging from the sensible to the silly, vote guilty. The particulars of the case are really not as important as the way the characters of the men are explored in the discussion that follows after one of the men refuses to back down in his vote of not guilty.
So, this is truly a memorable film - and not just because of the way it handles a potentially uninteresting topic with great skill. 12 Angry Men is just, quite simply, wonderful entertainment that leaves one thinking afterwards! Lastly, one other thing that is worth noting again is the cast - Henry Fonda is excellent, but the overall effect is only as good as it is because of the combined work of the experienced character actors involved. Enough raving already - just go ahead and see the film!",1030838400,2,1556,4.600719424460432
1397383,5,B000056HEC,"This is truly one of the most inspiring and awesome movies I have every seen.  Although basically every minute of the movie is in one room I was hanging on its every word.  The acting is great, but the real message is the there is a little bit of each of those characters in all of us.  Henry Fonda's character exposes the fact that all of us have our own issues and prejudices which guide each and every decision that we make.  Those 12 angry men are truly a microcosm of today's society.",1026432000,,489,4.225806451612903
1397384,5,B000056HEC,"TWELVE ANGRY MEN is unique in being one of the few films based on a television screenplay.  The movie developed out of Reginald Rose's 1954 teleplay for ""Studio One,"" and was just a critical success that it was filmed for general film release in 1957.
This film is all about one thing:  great acting.  The plot itself is as simple as any in the movies:  a jury convenes to render its verdict in a murder trial.  The initial vote is eleven guilty and one not guilty.  The remainder of the movie consists of the lone not guilty overcoming the prejudices, the biases, and the inner personal demons of the other eleven.
The ostensible star of the film is Henry Fonda, but all twelve actors do stunning jobs in their respective roles, and the way that these twelve extremely distinct personalities interact is one of the great joys of the film.  The film ends up a character study, as the moral and emotional make up of each individual is reveals as each personal reveals his reasons for defending his guilty or not guilty vote.  Many of the actors were stalwarts of the American stage.  Henry Fonda is best known as a film actor, but he frequently in his career made trips back to the stage.  Lee J. Cobb made nearly a hundred films, but far and away his greatest achievements were on stage, in particular in arguably the greatest role in an American stage play in the 20th century:  creating the role of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN.  E. G. Marshall is another actor familiar on screen, but whose greatest work was in theater.  The same is true of Martin Balsam and Jack Warden, who made his film debut in this movie.  But it isn't fair to do anything but praise all twelve actors.  Every single one leaves his mark on this film.
Any fan of great cinema or great acting needs to see this film.
There was later a first rate recreation of this film in color done for cable TV.  Jack Lemmon capably performed the Henry Fonda role and George C. Scott one.  Not quite as good as the original, but still exceedingly watchable.",1025913600,5,2039,4.482384823848238

Either you like old movies or not. If you belong to the first category chances are you have seen this one. If not, do it! This is the thriller of thrillers!
If old movies do not appeal to you either listen up or miss something really special! This movie goes back to basics, where the moviemakers actually had to think to create an exciting plot (No offence but most movies today tend to compensate a lousy story, bad dialogue or acting with hitech effects). They had to carry the stories on with well thought dialoges and characters.
I mean, we are talking about a movie talking place in one room (!), has the same 12 actors in it, an obvious ending (at least that is the impression you get!) and it is still so exciting that you forget the clock ticks! It's a thrill to see the story develop and to get to know the characters and what motivates their behaviour!
This movie has few modern counterparts, but I know one -- the usual suspects. If you like movies like that, go for it! If not, give it a shot anyway!",1023753600,3,1193,4.213973799126638
1397396,5,B000056HEC,"""12 Angry Men"" is an all time classic. It outshines all of the modern movies that have focused on court drama because it does what no other movie can do. It accurately informs the viewer of the movie about what really goes on in the back room where the jurors of a case discuss the trial and also gives a lesson on human nature. The movie is about a court case in which a young man is accused of killing his father. The movie picks up at the end of the hearing, right before the jurors go back into that back room. Of the 12 men that made up the jury, all but one man thought that the defendant was guilty. The man that thinks that the accused murderer is innocent is all by himself and over the course of this enthralling movie, we see how one man can overcome a majority and bring about what may be the truth.
 One of the great things about ""12 Angry Men"" is that it shows human nature at its best. 12 men are given the task of deciding whether or not a young man is guilty of murder. On man, as stated above, thinks that the defendant is inncoent of the crime. As the movie progresses the man that believes that the accused is innocent is the only man that will talk about the case and share his opinions. He uses logic and his own beliefs to prove what he wants to prove. The other 11 men start to think about what has been said and they start talking about the case. This is what shows human nature. This film shows that it takes just one person to help bring about the right way in doing something.
 This is a classic that nobody that is interested in the judicial branch should miss. After watching this film you get a good feeling inside because this is an all around great film. I strongly recommend this film because it gives accurate information on the jury system and reveals some information on human nature and physcology. I insist that you see this film, it is really worth it.
Happy Viewing!",1019606400,,1907,4.221917808219178
1397397,5,B000056HEC,"Most thrillers focus on the drama that happens in the course of a murder, or the drama that happens in the courtroom afterwards.  In 12 Angry Men, all the action occurs in the closed doors of the jury room after the murder and after the court-room theatrics.  It might be hard to imagine how a black and white movie shot virtually entirely in one jury room might be dramatic, but ""12 Angry Men"" certainly achieves a level of drama achieved by few other movies.  There are no special effects, no elaborate settings, and yet it's a movie with more power and passion than most contemporary multi-million dollar productions.
Much of the initial drama revolves around the murder case that the twelve jurors have to decide on.  Is the accused young man guilty or not-guilty of murdering his father with a knife?  Eleven of the twelve men are firmly convinced that he is guilty, and only one has doubts.  It is here that the real drama begins, as the jurors discuss the case, breeding personal conflicts as the lone juror (acted by Henry Fonda) pleads his case.  This is the movie's real strength, as it portrays vivid and brilliant characterization of the jurors.  They become frustrated and angry, with varying emotions and temperaments.  But one by one they begin to break under the burden of ""reasonable doubt.""  As the evidence is weighed in increasing tension, the jurors begin to change their guilty verdict to not-guilty.  The tension is shared by the viewers, because we don't know whether or not the accused is guilty, and like the jurors need to weigh the evidence as it is presented.
Is the accused guilty or not-guilty?  In the end, what happens in the jury room isn't so much about murder mystery, but about personalities, personal pride and egos. The sweltering heat and enclosed jury room proves to kindle emotions of anger and rage.  In fact, in the end we still don't know the final answer about the accused's guilt, who really did it and how.  Nor does Fonda's character argue that the defendant is innocent, but merely that there is not enough proof to determine his guilt.  But the fact that the question about guilt remains an open question at the end of the movie really doesn't matter.  It is the conflict of personalities that makes the movie so powerful: the 12 angry men in many ways represent ourselves.  Just as in the real world, these 12 men are composed of an assortment of personalities and people: such as the sports fan, the slum dweller, the mathematical thinker, the business man, the logician, the prejudiced emotional thinker, and the nerd.  The emotions and personal interaction are brilliantly portrayed, and amongst these 12 angry men many viewers will recognize themselves.  Not only is this movie a portrayal of logic in action, but ultimately it is a portrayal of aspects of our own human nature, including our own prejudices and personality flaws.  This is especially evidenced in the concluding scenes, where two jurors shake hands and introduce themselves by name.  It is only then that we realize that although the individual personalities of these 12 men are now so well-known to us, we don't even know their names.
If you are getting the idea that I was wowed by this movie, you're absolutely right.  Even though it is nearly fifty years old, it has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  If there is a weakness, it would be that it seems rather remarkable that the jurors uncover things not found in six days of trial.  But it is completely free of profanity and indecency, and is tremendously powerful in its portrayal of human emotions, personalities and conflicts.  The acting is superb.  It's a masterpiece.  Very highly recommended!  Go watch it.  And again.  And again...",1018310400,5,3731,4.766355140186916
1397398,5,B000056HEC,"It is very interesting movie. This film shows twelve mens debate in one room except first scene, which is inside a court and last scene, which is outside a court. It does not seem to take money. The synopsis of this film is quite plain. Twelve jurors sentence to a boy who is indicted for murder. However, one juror declares not guilty, he was not sure of guilty. Another jurors complained that, they think it more in detail. One by one, they have doubts and situations that were thought as a fact, become uncertain circumstance. Finally, they change their mind to not guilty one by one. It is a nice point of this film.
As I was watching this film, I found some peculiar things. It is a constituent of jury who are all men and Caucasian. It explains atmosphere of the society at that time as this film was made in 1957. U.S.A. accepts a jury system typically, so the constituent of jury is quite important. Twelve jurors all indicate different occupation, personality and thinking. This point is also amusing. At First, guilty was superior to not guilty eleven versus one, but at the end this situation completely changes on the contrary. It is splendid and attractive because of well-organized screenplay and outstanding performance. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, their acting was brilliant and impressive. This film is the best work as a courtroom film that is ever made.",1017619200,,1373,4.7012448132780085
1397399,5,B000056HEC,"12 Angry Men is one of the finest courtroom dramas ever created for the silver screen. Although many other movies have borrowed liberally from the plot, they have never captured the tension of this film or it's humanity. It is for this reason that I believe 12 Angry Men will outshine many other flashier movies to be a classic worth seeing by your grandchildren's children.
  The plot is very simple. A poor, young man from the wrong side of the tracks in on trial for murdering his father in a fit of anger. The evidence seems overwhelming: an eyewitness to the killing, a murder weapon was a knife owned by the young man, and he was seen fleeing from the scene of the crime. Guilty? You'll have to wait and see.
  Well, when our film starts the 12 jurors have just been led to the jury room where they are to decide if the defendant should be convicted and given the death penalty. Eleven of the jurors vote guilty without really reviewing any of the evidence. Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), juror #12, objects and asks that his apathetic companions at least give take a look at all of the information before sentencing the boy to death. The other 11 jurors are incensed by this waste of time but finally, they agree.
  Watch as the evidence is examined bit by bit and make up your own mind. Guilty? Innocent? That really isn't even the point. This is a beautiful example of how suspense can be wrought without eerie music and 2 million dollars worth of sets. Ninety-eight percent of the film takes place in a small, claustrophobic jury room where you can feel the heat of bodies and smell the sweat, and know the true face of the man who has the seat next to you. Layer and layer of pretense is stripped from the characters until their true selves emerge and then, and only then, can they begin to see the truth in the case.
  Although he has been nominated for 5 Oscars in the past, Sidney Lumet has never been given the kudos he deserves as a director. Without props or fantastic sets, this film relies heavily on intense performances from his all star cast-and he manages to bring it all together into a film that is even greater than all of its parts. I salute him. Don't miss 12 Angry Men -you will regret missing one of the finest movie experiences of your life.",1017273600,30,2266,4.430288461538462
1397400,5,B000056HEC,"One of the first and finest movies from the courtroom drama era of the late 50s and early 60s, 12 Angry Men is a marvel of moviemaking.  Henry Fonda plays the famed juror #8 with the perfect mix of reason, naivety, dignity, and diligence.  The claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in the jury room provides an overabundance of suspense, doing an even better job than one of my other favorite claustrophobic films, Hitchcock's experimental Rope.  Even with the constraints of being stuck within a small room, Lunet's direction of 12 Angry Men is masterful, with some of the simplest and yet some of the most artistic camera shots ever translated to film.  The human interaction between the jurors is the main story, and is played out beautifully, providing plenty of tension as the vote changes Fonda from an underdog into the majority's leader.  Keeping in mind that a dozen different men are crammed into one small room, it is essential that the film provides well-rounded character development, and in 12 Angry Men we see an example of perfect character development in film.  As the stories of the mens' lives are filled in, we find that not only do we know these people, we are these people.  The meek, the bombastic, the apathetic, the prejudiced.  Symbolism at its best.  Even with the unending idealism that makes the story a bit too Capraesque, you can't help but feel emotionally redeemed when they finally walk out into the courtroom",1015891200,3,1443,4.833333333333333

The motivations and drives of not just the characters we see, but the unseen defendant, DA, defense attorney, witnesses and the general public reflects true human nature.  You just don't see that type of honesty in movies often enough anymore.  Or this caliber of acting, directing and production.  The only thing you could say bad is that there are no women or minorities on the jury, but as this is 1957, it's no surprise.
