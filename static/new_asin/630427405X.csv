7866270,5,630427405X,"Searched for this movie, and found it on Amazon. I absolutely love it. I had recorded it years ago on a VHS tape, but do not have a VHS player anymore. It is such a good movie, and gives children who watch it much to talk about:being yourself, causing unintentional hurt to the person who loves you the most, and how to make things right again. The actors chosen for the film were perfect-so believable and natural. Recommend this movie for all age groups.",1373500800,,456,4.440476190476191

7866272,3,630427405X,"I haven't actually seen it yet,because it is a Christmas gift. But the packaging looked good. I just hope I don't have it mixed up with some other movie. But I bet it will be good.",1258329600,,180,4.027777777777778
7866273,5,630427405X,I am a big child at heart and I love this movie.  It is a great movie. It teaches many lessons to a younger child if you watch the movie with them to talk about the many lessons it teaches.  One is be greatful for who your parents are because what looks good on the other side isn't necessarily good.,1254700800,3,300,3.9833333333333334
7866274,5,630427405X,"Remember those days(Its about 24yrs since I left school)when you dreamed/studied of what life would be like in the future and how would we cope or reach our goal. I've never been a success at anything, I've been a tryer, thats about it. A few years ago(14),I met my father for the first time in my memory,I'd meet him a couple of times a year and He'd fill in some blanks from my youth, the usual Ifs,Whys and maybes. Then about 4yrs ago I saw this movie on some Satelite channel and the tears flowed. This is a truly Exceptional movie ,which I struggled until recently to obtain. The casting and location is first class, it may be predictable but you Will enjoy this Great FAMILY movie. My father passed away at the end of Jan. 2009 , deep inside when I grow up(Its never too late) I want to be Just like MY DAD! Thanks.",1237334400,6,821,4.269230769230769
7866275,5,630427405X,"ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD: YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE MAKING MOVIES ANYMORE!  We don't need your extreme violence, swearing, sex and filthy language to make good movies. After watching this movie I'm convinced that there is talent hidden in every corner of America.

This is the story of a young boy who was the object of harassment by high school bullies, and whose father was a timid, non-athletic type. The boy yearned for a father who could fill the void in his life.  So, he ""hired"" a ""father"", a handsome, intelligent executive who had a questionable past, to participate in high school sports with him, and to introduce to his friends as his real father.

The events that followed are somewhat predictable but not so much that you won't be thoroughly entertained.  But wait till the end--what a wonderful surprise.

Please do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  It is a clean family-friendly movie.  You may need Kleenex.",1174003200,6,920,4.7784810126582276
7866276,4,630427405X,"This is an alright movie. You can see it on the Disney channel, its about a 12 yr old boy whos not very popular, and hes kind of embarassed about his also nerdy dad, so he goes out and finds a guy lifting weights in a gym who would stand in as his dad while they go compete in a ""father/son"" day at their school and compete in things such as baseball and 3-legged races so that the boy can have a shot at popularity. Its a great movie!",1005523200,2,435,3.898876404494382
