2231588,5,B0007QQW5O,"I highly recommend this DVD.

Since becoming aware that vaccines are not safe through my first hand experience healing its causal damage to my autistic son (such as chelating mercury toxicity,combating measles encephalitis and gut inflammation etc )I have been researching further ,in order to uncover some other posible areas for further healing.

Dr Tenpenny differs from dozens of doctors I have heard and read ,who have discoverd the truth about vaccines,only in that she uses the CDC's own documents to prove her case.
She has no parent testimony or traditional medicine anecdotal stories.

Like Dr Vera Schriebner, she uses ""the enemy's"" own data base to prove conclusively that vaccines are not only ineffective but extremely dangerous (up to and including death) of many magnitudes greater than generally believed.
It reminds me of the myths surrounding incest/CSA (ie thought to be 1 in a million in the 1970s) which has been convincingly refuted as actually being 1/6 to 1/3 children.

Dr Tenpenny provides a clear headed ,rational, demolition of the myths surrounding the ""religion of vaccination"" as practised by the doctor/priests of ""modern"" western medicine.

I recommend this DVD to any person trying to decide about vaccinating their family (or patients).
I was a ""vaccine believer"".Religiously had all my children vaccinated exactly on the scheduled date.
As a direct result, they are currently recovering from CFS, ADD, Autism, PCOCS, allergies, food intolerances etc etc. I have a brother with Chronic demyelinating Polyneuropathy (initially diagnosed as Guillaume Barre Syndrome) finally told (afer 25 years) by a Sydney University Professor of Neurology that it was ""probably due to the yellow fever vaccine he had in the 1980s"" .

Now I am one of the 4% who KNOWS THE TRUTH. I will no longer have even my dog vaccinated and my 5 children (2 married) will NOT have my granchildren's immune systems destroyed by the toxic sludge called vaccines either.",1203033600,60,1973,5.208201892744479
2231589,5,B0007QQW5O,"Vaccine information presented straight from CDC documents.  Sheri Tenpenny has been on both sides of medicine and I trust her knowledge 100%.  I have a 6 month old son who has not received any type of vaccine and shocks his pediatrician at each wellness check due to how healthy he is,how much he has grown and his impressive weight gain.  We have a chiropractic clinic in which 2 patients who were permanently damaged by a live virus vaccine before the age of 2.  Both sets of parents confirm what Sheri Tenpenny presents in her video - all based on CDC clinical documents.  If you are on the fence, or know of a parent who is, watch Sheri and you'll be convinced that NOT to vaccinate is the  best way to  protect the health of your child.",1199145600,25,741,4.404411764705882
2231590,3,B0007QQW5O,"Don't expect to be entertained by this DVD.  It is consists of a videoed lecture given to a live audience by presenter, Sherri Tenpenny, substantially from fixed camera angles and the occasional Powerpoint(tm) screen dub.  However, that should not deter anyone wanting to know more about the health risks associated with vaccines and immunization (yes, there is a difference I discovered).  This may be the only DVD in general circulation on this important and neglected subject.  It is informative, authoritative, and thorough.  Parents in particular will derive benefit from the knowledge and arguments presented.",1192752000,25,615,5.5
2231591,4,B0007QQW5O,"At the minimum, you will re-consider your vaccination strategy after having listened to this lecture.
When coupled with other resources on the subject, one will eventually cross the psychological chasm and let go of vaccinations as a sustainable disease prevention tool altogether.

The lecture is well founded on science and formal CDC publications (I checked the references - they're real).

Only challenge is following Tenpenny's fast speaking pace for more than 2 hours lecture, packed with details, at times too technical.

2231592,5,B0007QQW5O,"Dr. Tenpenny reveals the coveted facts concerning the risk and questionable benefits of vaccines in her well-organized presentation. If you question her position, then ask why a recent bill was passed releasing any liability to all vaccine manufactures for public injury.

2231593,3,B0007QQW5O,"Many people ask about vaccines... but won't read a book... watching a video is one way to get the message to them.

The video is a bit dry:

It would have benefitted from some third party reports, animations and interviews... but it does appear to accurately portray the risks of vaccination. Re-releasing it with such extra bits would be a good idea.

A few months ago I got jabbed with a tetanus shot and asked the GP if it had mercury in it. He said ""No"": Upon checking the ingredients we found it had thiomersal (ethyl mercury) in it NB. The doctor didn't know that Thiomersal was mercury!!!

The video also includes information about allergies and infections as possible consequences of vaccination but doesn't flesh it out as well as it might.

The video also examines the political motivations of some of the newer vaccines: They often seek to ameliorate consequences rather than dealing with causes.

The magic bullet does not exist for some illnesses!!!

I wish the video was put together slightly better... because there is no doubt that the message is of vital interest to people.

2231594,5,B0007QQW5O,"I want to qualify my comments by stating that I have a degree in Microbiology and I did vaccine research as an undergraduate student.  That said, I believed, as did Dr. Tenpenny, the common ""truths"" about vaccine efficacy. There are 3 points that shake the pillars of common beliefs about vaccines: (1) many of the diseases that vaccines were produced to eliminate were already dying out before the vaccine was widely used; therefore, the diseases were eradicated by something other than the vaccines. That something was quarantine. (2) The emergence of diseases among a vaccinated population; the very thing the vaccine is designed to prevent.  (3) Virus reproduction occur only inside of cells.  In order for an antibody to destroy or prevent a virus from reproducing, it must be able to ""get"" inside a cell. The method used to introduce the infectious agent, known as an antigen, into a living body is not the way the natural infection enters a body.  The nature of the antibody response is dependent upon the portal of entry: the body will respond differently to an infectious agent injected into a muscle, the usual method of vaccination, than it will when it enters through the nose or bronchial tubes, the method flu and respiratory infections use.

This theoretical discussion pales next to this final point. The preservatives used by vaccine production are worse than the disease they are designed to treat. I would not allow my child to receive any vaccine that contained mercury at any level. With the media hysteria over Bird Flu  and smallpox a while back, I would strongly suggest no one rely on advise from any source that stands to gain financially or politically from it's acceptance.  Educate yourself on the facts. Make your decision based on science, not fear.",1170720000,473,1780,4.933110367892977
2231595,5,B0007QQW5O,"As a parent, this is an absolute MUST view! Vaccinating is a personal decision, but it is a decision and every parent must make sure that their decision is an informed one. This DVD will help. Dr. Tenpenny has been on both sides of the issue and has taken the time, that even your childs doc doesn't have, to read more than just the objective and conclusion of the scientific studies. She reads the ENTIRE study and picks it apart. I think even our pediatricians would be suprised at what she reveals.

Even my husband, who was leary about the fact of possibly not vaccinating, was awe struck by the findings. Do your children the favor, take the time, educate yourself on the pros and cons, make your decision an educated one. This dvd delivers facts and not hype. Dr. Tenpenny is an excellent speaker who knows her stuff and is easy to listen to and follow.",1157068800,108,859,4.471337579617835
2231596,5,B0007QQW5O,"Anyone who has children should at least watch this video.  If you are going to vaccinate your child, parents need to hear the other side of vaccinating.  The information is current and from the CDC.

2231597,5,B0007QQW5O,"I bought this DVD alongside Vaccines: the benefits, the risks the choices.  I recommend getting both.  Dr. Sherii Tenpanny reveals to us the ""real science"" behind vaccines - namely the fact that there doesn't seem to be much around that supports mass vaccinations for our young children.  You are left wondering why this state of affairs exists.  The well known cliche that ""money makes the world go around"" - at the expense of our children's health is a sad reality as this DVD shows and it is very important that this information is spread around as quickly as possible. It is clear that Metcalfe's law of value being equal to the number of users squared will be the only way to make change and improve the health of children and young adults for the future.  This should be the first DVD watched before your child is born as a headstart into the world of parenting where many decisions are going to come your way.  I hope that anyone who watches this will realise the vaccination is a ""decision"" not a ""taken as given"".",1120953600,64,1022,4.557377049180328
2231598,5,B0007QQW5O,"Dr Tenpenny gives a very clear explanation of the dangers of vaccines. Just like me, she came from a very strong allopathic background where it is taught how important vaccines are.

It took me about 3 times to finish the entire dvd, but it was worth it. I truly felt I learned alot from her and I also purchased numerous books on the subject. Please parents - educate yourself before you put ANYTHING into your childs body. There are personal stories of 2 of my cousins, 1 from each side of the family. Both cousins lost their 6 month old baby boy after getting all scheduled vaccines. One baby cried non-stop for about 7 hours after getting vaccinated (at age 6 month old) and then fell asleep and didn't wake up. My other cousin lost her 6 month old baby boy within 2 days of getting all vaccines. BOTH baby boys were 100% normal & healthy until their 6 month check ups. Vaccines are loaded with chemicals. Humans have been around for thousands of years, vaccines have been around for less than 100 years - and look how sick the human race has become in the past 100 years. If you educate yourself on how well the immune system works, you would be amazed! But please - EDUCATE YOURSELF! DO NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW THE MASSES! YOU make the decision for your childs health, do NOT allow ANYONE ELSE, not doctors, not peer pressure from friends or family. YOU do it. Your childs life may depend on it.",1382572800,11,1373,4.3671875

2231601,3,B0007QQW5O,"If I had never seen any other movies on vaccinations, I probably would have rated this movie higher. However, I recommend watching ""Vaccination: The Hidden Truth"", and ""Are Vaccines Safe?"" before watching this movie. Those two movies are more hard-hitting than this movie is, and if you only watch one of those two movies, watch the 90-minute version of ""Vaccination: The Hidden Truth."" It is the most stunning, hard-hitting, and direct movie of all three of them.

But if you're a doctor or a nurse, this movie may be a better introduction to the problems associated with vaccinations for you, as the presenter herself is a doctor, and she talks in more ""clinical"" terms than the people and doctors who are presenting in the other two movies.

This movie can be a good introduction to the problems associated with vaccinations, but I don't think it's going to change people's opinions on vaccinations as effectively as the other two movies will.",1349740800,6,946,4.90625
2231602,4,B0007QQW5O,"This issue of vaccines and developmental disorders is much like other recurrent cycles that occur when some contentious issues arise. There is a general level of incredulity, then refutations by the industries trying to prove something as safe, then extensive research over decade or two or more, and finally we say duh, this is so clear; let's ban it. So in hindsight everything will look clear and we would look foolish to believe otherwise, but it will still not affect our critical thinking on the present issues we would be dealing with - that may be, just may be there is something to it. Even thalidomide, where it is day and night in terms of its teratogenic/mutagenic effects, was met initially with incredulity about effects on fetal development. Not every other case is as lucky as thalidomide scenario, and most lie in grey area. Bisphenol A (BPA) is another one, where only two limited studies in 30's showed some malignant effects. No extensive studies were done to establish its safety, not to mention the tools for detection in cellular changes were crude at best in the 30's. With advancement in scientific tools, a revisit in 80s and 90s consistently showed ""low-level"" of changes induced by BPA. Working in this area, I can't tell you how many presentations I have attended recently where it has been shown to have estrogenic and other effects at doses that we are regularly exposed to (through metal can linings, sale receipts, etc). Some effects show up not in the first generation, but in second or third generations (epigenetic changes) (inferred from tissue and animal studies). And as late as 2008, the industries and institutions like NAMPA were still decrying that it is safe for babies. The case of lead toxicity and ""safe levels"" is another good example. So my hunch is that this is going to be the scenario with vaccines. There will likely be some fire under this smoke. Unfortunately, the tools (suitable assays) to understand the complex ""low-level"" neural and immune changes that occur with vaccine ingredients (be it the antigenic part, or the adjuvant/preservative parts) are not well-developed (immunity itself is a very complex topic to tackle, despite the enormous progress). So it is going to take a while and at some point we will likely see a multifaceted answer to the changes induced by vaccine ingredients in different populations, and especially some genetically predisposed, vulnerable populations, much like how diabetes turned out to be. Heterogeneity in population further muddies the water. So even though you may be genetically predisposed to something, it does not mean you will get it, unless you expose yourself to the environmental triggers. Perhaps, there will be tools to understand this genetic predisposition to vaccine ingredients, and research for safer alternatives. Until then (perhaps 2-3 decades), lets hope cooler heads prevail and doctors/people are more open to listen the opposing viewpoints, and not just brand others as conspiracy-dolts!",1331683200,6,3008,5.128309572301426

2231606,5,B0007QQW5O,"I really love this video, it's a lecture given at a college or university by a professional in medicine. The woman talks a lot about various types of vaccinations and how they came to be and their causes and effects, both good and bad. Rather than rely on scare tactics, she demonstrates through a very OCD lifestyle of hers of researching CDC documents and calling them to verify and double check their information if she finds inconsistencies. In the process of doing so much research she has found that other vaccinations that have been created, especially hepatitis B vaccinations can be more dangerous to the public than helpful.

It's not dramatic, it's not scare tactics, it's professional, informational, and very insightful. If you aren't prone to falling asleep in class, you will find yourself thinking about vaccinations differently than you used to. If you are like me, you probably don't think of them at all.",1298678400,3,923,4.95483870967742
2231607,1,B0007QQW5O,"The debate about national policy regarding standardized mass vaccination schedules is a very important topic.  I applaud Dr. Tenpenny's relentless search for the real risks of both vaccines and the diseases they are intended to prevent.  Both doctors and parents alike can benefit from further self-education from reliable sources regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines. It is true that all vaccines do have some very REAL RISKS of adverse events; however, the manner in which Dr. Tenpenny presents the ""Science"" of CDC document evidence is SEVERELY MISLEADING, perhaps even dangerous.  Again, vaccines are neither 100% safe nor 100% effective, and the diseases they aim to prevent often have ""low"" mortality/fatality without vaccination, as she points out (often only 2-5% death rates for the diseases she discusses)...

  HOWEVER the rationale behind vaccines is that there exists a NET BENEFIT, ON AVERAGE, for BOTH the vaccinated individual and for the public. In this regard, Dr. Tenpenny blurs the line between concerns about PUBLIC MASS VACCINATION PROGRAMS POTENTIALLY LACKING SUFFICIENT SAFETY STANDARDS and the current scientific understanding of the actual IMMUNE MECHANISMS BY WHICH VACCINES FUNCTION. The scientific understanding of these mechanisms is VERY clear to most doctors and microbiologists, as well as those responsible for the development of vaccines [and as a side-note: I have no affiliation with- nor loyalty to- drug companies, etc.] BUT Dr. Tenpenny presents some statistics with such a biased tone AGAINST VACCINES that some viewers may fail to realize the hypocrisy of some of her arguments [for example, emphasizing the risks of ""Flu-like illnesses"" such as Rhinovirus <which has no effective vaccine> and ParaInfluenza Viruses, which have NO RELATION TO THE INFLUENZA VACCINE, while downplaying the HUGE consequences of DISEASE CAUSED BY INFLUENZA, IN ADDITION TO those actually dying of the disease]...She similarly dismisses the illness of Pertussis as trivial, as if it were a routine thing of no consequence--but even the statistics on the slide presentation behind her show that ~10% of Pertussis cases have complications with Pneumonia. Pneumonia is NOT a TRIVIAL manifestation of disease, even 10%! Please 'Google' Pneumonia if you don't believe me. or use Wikipedia (with a grain of salt)...or take it to a real authoritative medical source (textbook, journal). These diseases ARE REAL. AND DANGEROUS. Vaccines do work in a majority of cases! ...and while immunity may not be complete (100%) or even permanent (life-long) after you or your kids get your shots, please be careful if you choose not to follow general CDC Immunization guidelines! Most of the diseases we have vaccine recommendations for are either VERY SERIOUS (i.e. Hepatitis B) OR VERY PREVENTABLE (i.e. Mumps, Rubella) or VERY COMMON (i.e. Influenza A) DISEASES. These diseases may not all be all 3(serious, preventable, AND common), but they are certainly NOT chosen at random, or haphazardly, as Dr. Tenpenny implies in her discussion of Influenza vaccine (because Influenza vaccine includes only some RELATIVELY IMPORTANT strains <sub-types> of the virus!).

  While physicians may sometimes make misleading generalizations that vaccinations are ""safe"" (because ON AVERAGE, they ARE deemed safe RELATIVE to the estimated burden of these diseases and their MORBIDITY/COMPLICATIONS without vaccines), the message of video strays DANGEROUSLY FAR to the other side of that generalization. Dr. Tenpenny's statements regarding disease risks appear very much out of context, and I am very concerned that her INTERPRETATIONS of data shown in this video have led to what I perceive as inaccurate and inappropriate conclusions.

  Like Dr. Tenpenny, I hope God blesses you and your family, and may you never have to live with some of these largely (but not entirely) preventable diseases. Modern medicine is not perfect, but please listen to your doctor. Most really do know what they're talking about and have good reason for the therapies they recommend, including preventative measures such as vaccines.

I wish I would have had this video when I wrote my last paper in nursing school on vaccines. At the time I gave them a glowing recommendation. However, having been in the field a few years, and having done a little more research I can't give them a the 100% recommendation I gave before. The amount of information from the pro and anti vaccination camps can be confusing to anyone. I can't tell you (nor should I) what is best for you and your family. What I can tell you is that you have to do your own research and check every fact. Remember, all healthcare decisons need to be an informed decision. One can only do this when they hear the benefits vs. the risks of any decision. I personally read all the handouts I had available to me at the clinic I worked at. Needless to say I was not impressed by them. I found them grossly incomplete when listing potential risks. If your considering whether to vaccinate or not to vaccinate you need to make an informed decision. This DVD is a good place to start. However, you really do need to obtain information from both sides. Then and only then can you truly make an informed decision. Please do your research.

 As a side note I brought my child in to get his 12 month child check. The clinic I went to just wanted me to sign a form getting the vaccinations (a limited amount of vaccines as a compromise between my wife and myself). No handouts, no benefits vs. risks.
