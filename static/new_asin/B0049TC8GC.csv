4294286,5,B0049TC8GC,"[Note: I own the thinpak version of this anime, but it's not likely to be much different than this re-release.]

This is the last of Bee Train's ""girls with guns"" series of animes, the first was Noir, second was Madlax, and lastly El Cazador.  I've watched all of them and it's been a blast...mapping analogies and comparing plot developments between them.  It's been like listening to variations on a theme for a musical composition.

Personally, my favorite of the three is El Cazador.  This time the gunslinger isn't superhuman.  Yes she's an extraordinary sharpshooter, but she makes mistakes.  The other half of the duo also isn't nearly so helpless as the analogous characters in Madlax were.  Ellis' skills develop at a nice pace through the entire series, so I never had to roll my eyes at a character being rescued or getting in the way *yet again*.  What's also nice is that the primary characters develop a comfortable relationship with each other over the course of the series.

In Noir, the main characters don't really even seem to tolerate each other until nearly the end of the series, or at least they refuse to show it.  Heck they even seldom speak to each other. The story was also darker, with an insane body count(but also with a wonderful moody style). In Madlax, the primary ""duo"" don't even meet until after the halfway point in the series! The story is also *very* convoluted. But with El Cazador, the story is much more streamlined, some comedic moments are thrown in and the two young women actually come to care about each other slowly and naturally ....believably.

There are some plot elements that were never resolved in the series though(in the next to last episode, Liro appears to be something more than just a little kid but there's not enough time to even begin to go there, and just who is this Melissa that Doug essentially left behind?)  I guess these questions could be followed up by future stories if so desired. But all the main story arcs were wrapped up nicely by the final episode, so I was satisfied even with a few unanswered questions.  This particular saga appeared to be all about character development and relationships, with just enough mysterious plot, comedy and action elements to propel it forward.  And that was perfectly fine by me.  So I'm not even gonna ding it a star for leaving a few threads dangling.

In summary, this anime is like comfort food for me.  I'm already watching it again.  Yes, the plot isn't it's strongest point, but I still found it to be pretty compelling.  There are lots of silly  moments too, but overall I found the ride to be quite enjoyable.  Many anime that I've seen are tragic, but this one leaves me feeling good by the end.",1293148800,30,2717,4.675789473684211
4294327,5,B0049TC8GC,Good anime for the last girls with guns trilogy. Good story and characters.,1426118400,,75,4.846153846153846
4294328,5,B0049TC8GC,I love this series and am so happy to say I have it as part of my DVD collection.,1407715200,,81,3.3157894736842106

4294330,3,B0049TC8GC,"Ellis is a girl who can't remember her past and Nadie, a bounty hunter, is the only one keeping her alive. As they travel together uncovering pieces of Ellis' strange past the girls become close friends.

Ellis and Nadie have different personalities but they fit well together and both bring something great to the anime. It's an interesting show with plenty of southwestern theme action and surprises and true friendship. There are an array of characters introduced in the show, all of which become either allies or foes of the girls.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I thought some parts were unnecessary or slow-paced. This DVD is in English.",1384646400,,658,4.7631578947368425
4294331,4,B0049TC8GC,"It's good, funny. The story is good, I would recommended this anime. The storyline is the same like Noir. But more cheerful and interesting. But if you like Spanish then get it.",1383091200,,177,4.5625
4294332,5,B0049TC8GC,"All they have is each other.
Ellis is a witch with a bounty on her head (dead or alive), and Nadie's trigger finger is the only thing keeping her friend from falling into the wrong hands. They're looking for pieces of Ellis's past,and every mile of open highway brings a new adventure.
Someone out there can explain the mysteries of Ellis's past. If she and Nadie just keep moving south, the Hunter and the Witch will get their answers soon enough.",1379894400,2,448,4.54320987654321
4294333,4,B0049TC8GC,arrived quickly....and in good condition. My son seems to enjoy playing it.. although he already beat it. Now on to another.,1369094400,,124,4.9523809523809526
4294334,5,B0049TC8GC,"I watched on crackle. Was hooked from the first show. The chemistry between Nadae and Ellis. And the mystery of Ellis's situation.
At the end of the series I was left wanting more. I was hoping to find a sequel, but no such luck. What will they do next?",1368403200,3,253,4.183673469387755
4294335,5,B0049TC8GC,SON LOVES ALL. HE ENJOYS ALL ANIME. WHAT ELSE CAN I WRITE. HE WATCHES IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN GREAT,1366329600,,98,3.95
4294336,2,B0049TC8GC,"Not a fan.  The plot was slow and left you with a lot of ""what if's"".  Not what I expected.",1366243200,,91,3.5
4294347,5,B0049TC8GC,"I happened upon this little gem while on Netflix and I'm so glad I didn't miss it. This show is certainly one that fans of shows like Noir and Madlax then El Cazador de la Bruja is a must have.

The story centers around Nadie and Ellis as they make their way through the Mexican back roads and deserts all while evading capture from CIA and trying to discover the secrets of Ellis's past. With a wild mixture of gunfights, comedic set backs, and endearing moments this show will be a great addition to both Anime collectors and those just started.

Without getting into the story too deep you will Follow Nadie and Ellis from their first, er...unique first meeting. Ellis is a young (and strange) girl who has been living with her grandmother until Nadie (ace bounty hunter and pretty young spit fire) comes to collect Ellis's bounty, or so she says. While actually working for a secret organization to help escort Ellis south, Nadie must fight off bandits, secret agents, and a rather persistent stalker all while trying to deal with Ellis's little episodes of crazy magic and flashbacks.

Will Nadie and Ellis find out Ellis's past? What is the involvement of the Witches? Can Nadie and Ellis make it to their destination in one piece while it seems the world is against them? What is Amigo Tacos? If you want to know the answers your just gonna pick up a copy for yourself.",1365465600,5,1376,4.585365853658536
4294348,5,B0049TC8GC,This DVD came exactly as described and it came pretty fast.  This collection includes all of the episodes from the original series and the audio is pretty good.,1362528000,2,160,4.714285714285714
4294349,5,B0049TC8GC,Action and comedy put together. Great series and I would recommend it to everyone who likes anime! A+++!  Nice work!,1354579200,,116,4.8
4294350,5,B0049TC8GC,I watched a few episodes before and was interested.  So I bought the complete series and was happy I did.  The shipping was fast.,1350345600,,129,4.333333333333333
4294351,4,B0049TC8GC,"This is the first anime I have purchased, and this review is of the packaging and extras. I viewed the entire show on a streaming video site, so I already knew I loved it and wanted to buy it. It's slow, and focuses on character relationships over action, and won't be to everyone's taste, so I recommend watching at least some of it online to see if you like it. Also, I would not rate the series TV-MA like some listings do; it has some language and violence (no sex, a few shots of non-sexual nudity from behind) but not more than a PG-13 movie.

The show comes with 4 discs in a single DVD-sized case so it doesn't take up much room. I liked the cover art.
It contains both dubbed and subbed versions, so you can pick whichever you prefer.
One thing I wish was included was a set of word-for-word subtitles of the English translation (because the Japanese-translation subtitles don't always match up with the dubbing). I later learned that most anime releases do not include English CC.
Not a whole lot in the way of special features: Episode 1 and 24 have a commentary track, and there are textless songs. The trailers are listed as a special feature, but personally I just wish there was a way to skip them at the beginning of each disc.

Finally there is a funny blurb on the back of the case: ""As fun and dirt-filled as you could want"" - Carl Kimlinger. Yep, Carl, I think that about sums it up.

So it ain't perfect, but the price I got here at Amazon (under thirty dollars) was reasonable, especially for a show I plan to watch repeatedly. Tacos tacos tacos, super tasty tacos...",1336694400,4,1589,4.3979591836734695
4294352,5,B0049TC8GC,"It's a good mix of comedy and action. The story is very well written; it consistantly adheres to the rules of reality set forth in the storyline. And the characters are believable in that they are human. Their skills - even those with supernatural abilities - do not make them unstoppable fighting machines. Their backgrounds and motivations round out the series rather well; in fact, you might find yourself feeling sorry for some of the villians. All and all, El Cazador de la Bruja is a show worth watching.",1327795200,,510,4.741573033707865
4294353,2,B0049TC8GC,"The anime reminded me of Noir but with fillers and a lot less fun. Good presentation, excellent music, good idea but not well use for entertaining. The problem is that half of each episode feel like fillers. In all the anime, there are maybe 3 episodes that were good from the first to the last minutes. All of the other begin like fillers and take half the running time before turning toward the real story. I Rated it 2 stars because of the music, without it, it would have been only one star.

Not recommended. Buy Noir instead :)",1320451200,2,533,4.383838383838384
4294354,5,B0049TC8GC,Another great DVD set. Not quite as good as Noir but of the three DVD sets the third set is really good. Well worth the price!,1317513600,,126,3.8846153846153846
4294355,4,B0049TC8GC,The DVD arrived as promised as well as on time and in new condition. I would like to say thank you very much.,1317168000,,109,3.782608695652174
4294356,5,B0049TC8GC,"El Cazador de la Bruja is a top-notch story of Nadie, a bounty hunter, and Ellis, the 17 year-old girl she is protecting. The anime qualifies only distantly as a ""girls with guns"" story, since Nadie is in fact armed, but the shoot-`em-up elements are minor compared to the story of Nadie and Ellis' relationship as they wander around somewhere between the Southwestern US and Mexico being chased by a hell's-brew of wealthy government agencies, witches, love-sick mutants, and other bounty hunters all with suspicious, if not downright nasty, agendas. We quickly learn that Ellis is not what she seems to be (we never thought she was), but the focus isn't on the dramatics. So if you want a slam-bang noir-flavored gun story, watch something else - because otherwise El Cazador de la Bruja is going to bore you witless. The settings and characters nearly always involve poor people, marginally linked to society, in a picaresque road-trip tale of near-misses and near-disasters as Nadie and Ellis try to reach Wiay Marka, a place somewhere to the South that promises to explain (Ellis thinks) all the things she has forgotten... like who she is, and why all these people are after her. Throughout, the tone and animation are strikingly realist - El Cazador has few trappings of the supernatural, but a good many images of slums, street hoodlums, and girls dressed up as Amigo Tacos waitresses, one of the jobs Nadie and Ellis take on when their money dries up... But always the focus is on Nadie and Ellis, and how they try to connect with each other emotionally and survive in a very strange world. Nothing is ever what it seems to be (we never thought it was) except, as one character says, ""Anywhere you can get three meals a day is heaven."" Think John Steinbeck crossed with Stand Alone Complex. El Cazador de la Bruja is first-rate. Just don't think it's a ""girls with guns"" story.",1299369600,17,1886,4.770642201834862
8419308,3,B0049TC8GC,Very interesting story and animation. Somewhat goofy ending which is pretty typical for many anime series.,1500768000,,106,5.6875

8419311,4,B0049TC8GC,"It was pretty good. A little gunslinging here, a little emotion there. Decent animation as well as part of the acclaimed ""Girls With Guns Trilogy"". Also, do I even need to mention that Yuki Kajiura was the composer for this anime? That basically makes it an instant watch (and buy, since the anime itself is actually pretty good)",1466208000,,329,4.689655172413793
