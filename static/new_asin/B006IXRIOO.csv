4992353,4,B006IXRIOO,"I like how one of the characters reaches out to a young person ... with their rugged manner of doing things and leads them to the Lord.  The pace gets a little slow, yet it is great evangelistic film for the young and old.",1366675200,,222,4.045454545454546

I love this movie and I am into collecting all Christian Movie cause they are heart touching and they get you to believe in our lord and Savior (Jesus Christ).,1357344000,2,294,4.267857142857143
4992357,5,B006IXRIOO,I rented this movie from amazon to watch during hurricane sandy.  I wanted something to be able to watch if we were home without power I could watch it on my kindle.,1353369600,,165,4.15625
4992358,1,B006IXRIOO,"I waited quite a while for this movie to come out and what a disappointment.  The acting in this movie is so poor it is hard to watch... I don't  know whose fault it is, maybe the actors maybe the script, but ultimately the movie is very poor.",1338595200,2,243,4.041666666666667
4992359,1,B006IXRIOO,The story is good - but the acting is soooooooooooo poor and it's soooooooooo slow - and then the ending doesn't wrap anything up.  Our whole family adores Natalie Grant - and were really looking forward to this movie....we have a growing Christian movie library...........but this one was weak.,1335398400,8,295,5.020408163265306
4992360,5,B006IXRIOO,"When it comes to Christian movies I think I've seen them all and I'm always looking for more.  This one is very good with scripture quotation and a reverent attitude toward Jesus Christ.  The title refers to the personal decision every person must make to receive Christ.  The story is about a mother and son grieving over the loss of the husband in the family with a sub plot of forgiveness between family members.  If you like Christian movies, give this one a try.  It's very good.",1330992000,8,484,4.517241379310345

4992366,4,B006IXRIOO,This is a great movie.  It really shows how different life can be even in difficult times when you have Jesus on your side.  Life starts when you accept Jesus.,1447804800,,159,4.266666666666667

4992371,3,B006IXRIOO,"Plot inconsistencies, poor acting, questionable script management, seemingly unrelated music score, over-simplified theology all made a forgettable movie. Sorry - I really wanted to like it.",1434153600,,190,6.346153846153846
4992372,5,B006IXRIOO,Great message.,1430956800,,14,6.5
4992373,1,B006IXRIOO,We turned it off after the first 15 minutes because the acting was so horrible. Natalie Grant can sing beautifully but she definitely cannot act. There are so many poorly made Christian movies out there and this is one of them!,1426896000,,227,4.560975609756097
4992374,5,B006IXRIOO,Excellent and I love this movie.,1425513600,,32,4.5

4992380,4,B006IXRIOO,A 5 on story line but a 3 on the acting... still worth the watch,1406678400,,64,3.3333333333333335
4992381,4,B006IXRIOO,"It is hard to know what to rate it.  It was overall a good story.  However, it was very boring in so much of the movie.  It didn't seem to start moving till about 28 minutes into it.  I only watched it because I like Natalie Grant's music, but wow the acting was a struggle to watch.  I loved that the gospel was presented in this movie, so I hate to rate it lower, because we can certainly use more movies that portray real life and the hope of Jesus Christ in them.  It is just a really slow movie.  Some good relationships in there, especially between the grandfather and grandson.  Natalie Grant's music is only played the last 45 seconds of the movie.",1406419200,,656,4.233870967741935

4992383,2,B006IXRIOO,"Saw this movie on up lifting entertainment and I didn't like it at all. Slow moving, boring, & the acting wasn't good also.. I have seen better movies like Courageous ...There are much better Christian movies out there and this is not one of them.. I just didn't like it...",1394236800,,273,4.48
4992384,5,B006IXRIOO,Good movie and really gets you to thinking just how much Jesus suffered for us.  If it doesn't pull at your heart then you need to do some thinking.  Are we living like Jesus did?  Do we forgive like he did?  He is just a prayer away during a storm.,1392508800,,249,3.92
4992385,4,B006IXRIOO,Very thought provoking. Deals with true to life situations. Our necessity for a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. How Loving our God is to you and me.,1390867200,,157,4.851851851851852
4992386,2,B006IXRIOO,I did like the movie it's just I got two copies of it and now i Deals won't give me a Return Authorization # and that stinks for me,1390694400,,131,3.5517241379310347
4992387,1,B006IXRIOO,Not the best acting and storyline but a good moral at least. Not something I would recommend to order or watch.,1385856000,,111,4.333333333333333
4992388,3,B006IXRIOO,"The message was clear, but the acting needed some help.

with two big names: Natalie, and Billy; my expectations were high for quality

Hope they contiue and get some training!",1382054400,,176,4.833333333333333

8499053,5,B006IXRIOO,you won't be disappointed,1489622400,,25,5.5
8499054,3,B006IXRIOO,"I rented the HD version of this movie and just watched it on my Kindle Fire. There was a really great storyline here, with meaningful themes. A grieving, troubled family, the reparation of family relationships, overcoming hardship by learning to trust in and rely on the God who made us all and sent His Son to save us.  There was never any doubt where this story was going, but the journey to get there proved to capture my interest and cause me to shed tears. The acting wasn't professional throughout, but the story was strong enough it didn't matter much. I loved how the theme of forgiveness was carried throughout the movie. What I found lacking was the complete BIblical references to how to receive the gift of salvation. Verses were chosen to illustrate some, but not all of God's instructions found throughout the New Testament. It is mentioned in the movie that Jesus Christ was our greatest example of how God wants us to live. If the viewer uses this to reach someone for Christ, be sure to encourage that someone to read and study in the same New Testament quoted from how Jesus started His ministry with the example of baptism by immersion, and inspired His apostles to teach it as how to receive both forgiveness of sins and the dwelling of the Holy Spirit. If the movie had not omitted this act of obedience as a response to a main character wanting to receive salvation purchased for us by Jesus dying on the cross for mankind (and resurrecting from the grave, overcoming death and Satan - which to my recollection was also not mentioned), I would have given it five stars.  In all the wonderful scriptures mentioned regarding the ""Decision"" a main character was being taught he needed to make, the movie left out ones like Acts 2:38,  a direct response by the apostle Peter to the question, ""What must we do to be saved?""",1489190400,,1840,4.603658536585366
8499055,5,B006IXRIOO,Awesome movie and I love it for teenagers showing it in their language.,1484784000,,71,4.538461538461538
