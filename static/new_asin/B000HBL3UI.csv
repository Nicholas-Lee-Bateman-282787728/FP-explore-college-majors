8138020,4,B000HBL3UI,"The popular mystery writer Elmore Leonard makes his tenth or so appearance on Charlie Rose. He has with him a new book of stories , something a bit different from the small novels through which he has made his reputation. He also talks to Charlie Rose about his Ten Rules for Writing which are essentially 'ten rules for not writing' or perhaps more correctly 'Ten Rules for Writing like Elmore Leonard'. They essentially are rules for a minimalist kind of storytelling in which dialogue plays a central part. Leonard is a writer of great reputation in this area and speaks in a reasonable, competent way about his work.",1203897600,,620,4.75
