2520910,5,B000EHSVE6,While I'm a great fan of the show M*A*S*H I just got my season ten dvd set and to my surprise... 20th century fox has decided to release the entire series as a collectors set!!! with extras!! it's due out Nov. 2006. now had I known this from the begininng I surely would not have opurchased the seasons seperatly I would have waited for the collectors set this fall. After i was curious why these DVD sets had no extras. Anyways I personally don't need two sets of the same DVDs but I'm really angry at Fox for doing this. This to me is just an excuse to suck more money out of people. I was really looking forward to these DVDs as they came out but now I'm more disgusted at Fox more than anything. Anyways I just thought I'd give everyone a heads up that if you're looking for extras and haven't purchased any of the series yet wait till Nov. and get the collectors editon.,1148342400,9,875,4.214285714285714
2520911,5,B000EHSVE6,Yes I agree there are some excellent episodes in year ten.  Does anyone know if they will put goodbye farewell ahem in the dvd set?,1146096000,3,131,4.24
2520912,5,B000EHSVE6,"I've been through the discussion with a few friends about early M*A*S*H vs later M*A*S*H episodes...some folks insist that after Henry and Trapper left the series that it got too heavy-handed and lost its direction. I disagree with that, I feel the show in its early years was no doubt some of the finest comedy on the tube, with a great ensemble cast that worked well together. Well, the realities of war and of doing a long running series are that people come and people go. Certainly the fabric of the show changed over the years but I think the ensemble got even tighter as a result of those changes and the stories had more heart and less slapstick. As funny as Mclean Stevenson was as Col. Blake, Harry Morgan filled some tough shoes with style as the no-nonsense-but-all-heart Col. Potter. The final two seasons of M*A*S*H were described by Alan Alda as being stories written as a result of not wanting to repeat things they'd done before. We get more insight into the individual personalities of the staff (one of the more touching and well-done examples of this is when Winchester has to tell a concert pianist that his right hand won't be as useful as it once was and ultimately proves to him that he still has the gift of music as long as he doesn't let his circumstances silence it). I think it's to the credit of M*A*S*H that it did change and grow over the years...and there are plenty of fine examples of that in season ten and eleven. I look forward to both!",1143763200,50,1474,4.503731343283582
2520913,5,B000EHSVE6,"Mash is one of my favorite tv shows. I watched mash every week on cbs,and i was so happy to get mash seasons 1 through 9. The show matured over the years,and season ten is in my opinion the best of the best. I cant wait to get my copy of mash season ten...I hope my review was helpful to you. I thank you Stewart L.",1142294400,16,315,3.787878787878788
2520914,5,B000EHSVE6,"Season 10 is probably one of the finest seasons of M*A*S*H since this would be the time that most of the 4077 would get ready for what would be the next to last season of the show. Thus this show would feature some great episodes!! Here is an overview.

1.) That's Show Biz (10/26/1981)

A touring USO show brings an unexpected touch of vaudeville to the 4077th when the star showgirl requires an emergency operation. And wouldn't you know, the comedian is Klinger's hero!

2.) Identity Crisis (11/2/1981)

Father Mulcahy counsels a GI who is plagued by guilt because he has swapped tags with a dead colleague. Meanwhile, B.J. and Charles consider ways of keeping a soldier-salesman quiet.

3.) Rumor at the Top (11/9/1981)

The latest scuttlebutt affects everyone's behavior when a visiting is rumored to be recruiting for a new M*A*S*H unit. The gang fears that the 4077th will be split up.

4.) Give 'em Hell, Hawkeye (11/16/1981)

Hawkeye writes a heartfelt letter to President Harry Truman to protest at the continued fighting in Korea. Meanwhile, Colonel Ditka has promised a much-needed water-heater if the 4077th beautifies the camp.

5.) Wheelers and Dealers (11/23/1981)

On the eve of a big poker game, B.J.'s pride is bruised when he finds out his wife is working as a waitress. And Potter takes driving lessons from Klinger.

6.) Communication Breakdown (11/30/1981)

Winchester infuriates the camp when he hoards his stateside newspapers, and Hawkeye reunites two Korean brothers who have been fighting on opposite sides of the war.

7.) Snap Judgment (Part 1 of 2) (12/7/81)

The military police think they've solved a rash of thefts at the 4077th when they apprehend Klinger with Hawkeye's stolen camera.

8.) Snappier Judgment (Part 2 of 2) (12/14/81)

B.J. and Hawkeye resolve to clear Klinger's name after he chooses Winchester to defend him at his military court-martial.

9.) 'Twas the Day after Christmas (12/28/1981)

To boost post-yuletide morale on Dec 26, Potter has the officers and enlisted men change places for the day.

10.) Follies of the Living - Concerns of the Dead (1/4/82)

Whilst suffering a fever, Klinger communicates with the spirit of a dead soldier, Private Weston, who stays on to witness his own last rites.

11.) The Birthday Girls (1/11/82)

Margaret's birthday plans are spoiled when she and Klinger get stranded on a desolate roadside. Meanwhile, Charles gives a lecture for Margaret, and the surgeons assist in the delivery of a calf.

12.) Blood and Guts (1/18/82)

Hawkeye is outraged when a sensationalistic war correspondent, Clayton Kibbee, reports irresponsible G.I. stunts as tales of military valor. Kibbee: ""As for the last two pints of blood, there's no big finale, no heroes. They helped an old soldier, who'd had visions of glory but finally got it through his thick head how tragic and inhumane war can be. Maybe he'll know better next time.""

13.) A Holy Mess (2/1/82)

An AWOL soldier, Nick Gillis, seeks sanctuary in the mess tent, after Father Mulcahy's service. At the same time, a special Sunday brunch is due to be served, following the donation of some eggs to the camp by a grateful farmer.

14.) The Tooth Shall Set You Free (2/8/82)

Charles has a serious toothache, but hates the thought of having anything done about it. The doctors suspect prejudice when an inordinate number of black casualties are brought in from a single unit, led by Major Weems.

15.) Pressure Points (2/15/82)

Potter sends for Sidney Freedman when he loses confidence in his surgical abilities, and Winchester loses patience with his bunkmates' sloppiness.

16.) Where There's a Will, There's a War  (2/22/82)

Hawkeye goes to help at an aid station, and under heavy shelling he draws up a will, leaving various items to his friends at the 4077th.

17.) Promotion Commotion (3/1/82)

Winchester, Pierce, and Hunnicutt find themselves in the sticky position of having to decide which enlisted men to recommend for promotion. For Winchester it could be a matter of life and death.

18.) Heroes (3/15/82)

Hawkeye is the golden boy of the world press when he treats a celebrity prizefighter, 'Gentleman' Joe Cavanaugh, who has a stroke at the 4077th. Father Mulcahy finds the news hard to take, as Cavanaugh was a hero of his.

19.) Sons and Bowlers (3/22/82)

After losing to the Marines once again, Colonel Potter wishes there was one sport the 4077th were any good at. When Klinger mentions he can bowl, the Colonel decides to have a bowling competition. Unfortunately, he and Klinger are the only 2 good bowlers in the camp, so BJ and Father Mulcahy are ""recruited"" to the team. Colonel Potter becomes obsessed with winning the game, and excludes Margaret from the team because she helped the team lose at softball. Then the 4077th team hear the Marines have got a ""ringer"" in their team after pulling some strings..... Meanwhile, Hawkeye finds out his father is in hospital and tries to speak to him over the phone, watched by Charles, who envies Hawkeye's close relationship with his father.

20.) Picture This (4/5/82)

Potter's attempts to assemble the crew for a family portrait are thwarted by a feud between bunkmates Pierce, Hunnicutt, and Winchester. Things are not helped by the efforts of Margaret, Klinger and Mulcahy to bring the Swampmen back together.

21.) That Darn Kid (4/12/82)

Klinger buys a goat, with the intention of getting rich by selling it's milk. Then the goat eats the 4077th's $22,340 payroll, leaving paymaster Hawkeye holding the bag. Meanwhile, Charles also thinks he can make a killing when he sees an ancient vase.

2520990,5,B000EHSVE6,"These DVD sets are worth having just for the fact that you can watch them without the phony laugh track, if you choose that option. I wasn't in love with the first few seasons, originally. For one thing, on TV, the laugh track is as loud as the dialogue. It got quieter with the later seasons, and the more serious story lines. But the comedy is much funnier with the laugh track. It was a big issue with the producers and creators of the show, and now I see why. Watch all the seasons without the canned laughter, and a great show gets even better.",1467331200,,549,4.238095238095238

2521077,5,B000EHSVE6,"By Season 10 of M*A*S*H the TV series had lasted longer than the war.  Some of the egos began showing and issues offstage carried over occasionally to the onscreen presentation.

The writing, once keen and sharp had become same-o, same-o.  Very few episodes were unpredictable.  The spark had gone and the magic had ceased.  They were cruising on inertia.

M*A*S*H still held the hearts of a nation but Reagan held our loyalty.  We no longer had to look to television to feel proud if ourselvea or our country.  M*A*S*H was nearing its final bow.",1403481600,2,546,4.73404255319149
2521078,4,B000EHSVE6,"I'm a long time MASH fan, who doesn't have cable TV and, as you probably know by now, that relegates me to buying DVDs if I want to watch this wonderful show. Recently, I decided to begin buying one season at a time to eventually get the whole series.
Unfortunately, the DVD is all but un-watchable. Since I have no cable and mostly watch streaming video, I have no dedicated DVD player (can u say obsolete?), and therefore, watch DVDs on a computer.
This disc wouldn't even play on my 5 year old desktop/entertainment pc. The DVD-ROM drive made unusual grinding noises (an older DVD played just fine). When I brought out my nearly new Sony laptop and opened with PowerDVD, it played for a couple hours, then randomly decided I didn't have the proper driver to play this ""protected"" disc. PowerDVD then crashed. I then opened VLC and, after an update, was watching again. Then I decided to take a break, pausing the MASH DVD and putting the PC on standby. When I came back to it, VLC crashed and the drive started making a grinding noise I have never heard out of this computer before. I had to restart my laptop in order to get it to read the disc again.
Since the holders of the MASH copyright are a bunch of fascist douchebags, they insist on copy protection that is so good, the customer can't even play the disc half the time. Nevertheless, a good DVD pirate can still copy the disc!
As this is the only way to watch MASH, I have no choice but to keep buying the defective discs. However, I will be documenting each and every malfunction along the way for an eventual Class-Action Lawsuit against the Copyright Holders (for operating a monopoly) and the authors of the DVD, for producing a substandard, unreliable product and for possible damage to my DVD-ROM drive by commanding it to operate in an abnormal way.
Unless you are a die hard MASH fan, it will be a frustration not worth dealing with to buy this DVD.

2521090,4,B000EHSVE6,"Im a big MASH fan of the movie,and the tv series. For me after season 8 is when they begin to lose steam. Alan ""Sensitive"" Alda has taken over everything and the writing is just not what it once was. Most of the cast thought after the tenth season they should hang it up,but Cbs got 16 more episodes out of them for season 11. That being said if you find this for around $10 you should buy it.there are a few episodes that would be worth the $10 but after that,ugh. Pressure Points contains what i think is the funniest interaction between the Swamp rats,and the fact that little dialogue was used is probably my favorite interaction between Hawkeye,BJ,and Charles. 'Twas the Day after Christmas is good and Follies of the Living - Concerns of the Dead is probably the best episode on here.the rest just make you wonder why the show was still on.",1363651200,,846,4.42948717948718

Apart from the admirably offbeat ""Follies of the Living  Concerns of the Dead,"" the 1981-82 episodes are tired, repetitive and mostly unfunny. When Klinger gets promoted to sergeant, you realize the writers have run out of ideas.

2521095,5,B000EHSVE6,"For years we watched M.A.S.H. watched them move the characters around, and laughed at them.  Usually they were shown on certain nights, and we sat and enjoyed them.  Being a WWII Korean time Vet my husband loved M.A.S.H.  We never missed one.  Even tried to copy them with our Beta Max, but that died.  Now I have the complete set and my daughter sat and watched with me, as we went thru them one at a time, sometimes 2 a night or day, depending on our schedules.  you cannot go wrong with M.A.S.H. they got so many awards and the fact that they made their job so happy with jokes they played on each other and of course you have to have those that were smarter and of a higher rank in the movies made it even more enjoyable. I am not sorry to pay $110.00 for the complete set and will keep them forever!  Watching and enjoying what our doctors and nurses went thru in Korea.
God Bless those veterans of yesteryear!  I will forever remember them, and was fortunate enough to get a letter from Jamie Farr from Twentieth Century Fox on a reply from me.  I have saved that and began a collection, even have the liquor tubing and mimicing the way they made their juice.  They filled the screen with joyful laughter and jokes played on each other and then excitement.  Buy the set, you will never be sorry.  God Bless Our Veterans!  A Collectible Set!

M*A*S*H got better with every passing season and season 10 is a 10!  There is a lot of character development in this season and it deepens many of the story lines.  Although there are still plenty of laughs there are also some great dramatic episodes such as the one where Klinger has a high fever and speaks to a dead soldier.  The Boxing Day episode is enlightening, serious and hysterical, all at the same time.  A prime example of the true gift of this series.",1312675200,,579,4.476190476190476

2521110,5,B000EHSVE6,"Okay Alda is well into his liberal preachy directing phase here, but it's all in all worthwhile television. The characters have depth to them. If you have been watching since season 1, the characters by the time you get to this season, are all good friends welcomed into your home....

I grew up watching MASH on TV, and recall even when the new episodes were common place, that the local TV station would play 2 hours straight of MASH starting at 10:00 P.M. As a kid I remember falling asleep to the sounds as my parents watched the reruns. Fast forward 30 years, and I find that play all feature allows me to do the same thing without having to rely on the TV stations to play the episodes. Maybe a little strange on my part, but I bet I am not the only one that does this.... I just wish the first 4 season DVD sets had this feature!",1270944000,,836,4.225

2521112,5,B000EHSVE6,"I had foolishly bought each DVD seperatly , so I will write this review for all of the set.  These DVDs are watched all the time now.  I have such a crush on Alan Alda, and a yearning to be close them all the time.  This is what makes this collection so dear to my heart.  They are funny, and always make me laugh,  no matter what mood I am in.  BUT, they are heartbreakingly true about the horrors of war.  These Doctors, nurses and staff, all faced Hell,  and yet stuck it out to help all the fallen Victims.  Not just the soldiers, but citizens of Korea who were suffering and in the middle of it all.  The Doctors who faced death everyday themselves to patch up the young brave men, and then having to send them back into the waiting arms of terror.  Alda was Superb as the dedicated Doctor who helped all he met, even though he hated the war with every breath he took.  Now that we are at war again,  I feel everyone should see this.  You will realize that we [mostly] hate war, but do support the young men and women who are putting this lives in real danger to protect us all.  They were the true Heroes, those who actually fought or helped repair our soldiers bodies and sometimes their minds too, and all the soldiers, who came home missing limbs and part of the Souls,  and to those who never made it home.  This is tv at it's best!  It should be in every home and on everyone's mind!",1259452800,3,1394,4.157303370786517
2521113,4,B000EHSVE6,"Another reviewer has helpfully added synopses for all of the episodes, so I'll just add a few thoughts about Season 10 when taken as a whole.

Although I thought the show improved swapping Colonel Potter for Henry Blake and Charles Emerson Winchester III for Frank Burns, the cast mix definitely suffers from the loss of Gary Burghoff as Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly.  Corporal Max Klinger has shed his dresses and pursuit of the ""Section Eight"" discharge after taking over as company clerk, and although Klinger is still a great and interesting character (and featured in more storylines this season), the show as a whole suffers without the sweet and innocent perspective of Radar.

Hawkeye is more different than his gradual progression from the other nine seasons combined.  The early Hawkeye is the uncontested King of the surgeons as well as an incorrigible ladies man.  The medical skills of season ten Hawkeye are depicted as only on a par with the remainder of the staff, and Dr. Pierce is frequently rebuffed by the nurses who in previous years wouldn't hesitate to accompany the olive-clad Lothario to a rendez-vous behind the motor pool or supply room.",1252627200,2,1159,4.984455958549223

2521141,5,B000EHSVE6,"M*A*S*H may have taken several seasons to get into a steady rhythm, in which it produced hollywood gold on the little screen, but the near end result assured fans that there was still much fun to be had in the sage years.

  M*A*S*H, especially in it's thriving years, exercized its slow and steady paced plots, deep dialogue, and meaningful values to reflect its reformation from the old, dry-but-funny era that had us laughing more than delving into the character's persona. The ""new"" M*A*S*H, holding characters converted from phenoms such as Trpper john, Henry Blake, and Frank Burns, though just as funny, brought the realities of the character's homes and the dramas and stress during war time that just wasn't presented by a dry joke.

  Season ten became the oasis where the fans could still relax before the show's departure. It gave most of them reasurance whenever the character's would complain about the truce talks being far from over. Certainly the episode, GIVE 'EM HELL HAWKEYE, where Hawkeye writes a frustrated letter to President Truman pleading with him to stop the ""darn"" war. He wrote, ""We are stuck in korea, or as we like to call it hell, and we'd like to go home before winter when hell freezes over.""

  Another interesting one, CONCERNS OF THE LIVING- FOLLIES OF THE DEAD, is when Klinger falls into a fever dream and he is able to communicate the the spirit of a casualty-turned-dead soldier.

  If there is a M*A*S*H episode that's not worth comitting to memory, let alone watching over and over again, it does not exist. i too look forward to the last season.

I agree with other reviewers that it is unfair of Fox to add anything to the discs that have already been released and faithfully collected over time, without offering the extra material to the rest (majority) of us.",1149724800,2,796,4.830882352941177
2521152,4,B000EHSVE6,"Usually, we are about a year and a half behind dvd releases but for MASH Season 10, it was released earlier than usa and Season 11 is coming in early july as well...Season 10 was presented rather well but i do have 1 slight complaint about the artwork.  there are numerous photos online taken aroudn the time of season 10(1981-1982)  so why did fox use an old season 5 picture? Bj hasn't been without a moustache for over 4 seasons so why have it?  The artwork on back and top is much more satisfactory, with contexual photos of Margret and Hawkeye.  Apart from the slight complaint, the content is really good.. high quality soudns and picture.",1148860800,,645,4.5344827586206895

2521155,1,B000EHSVE6,"I just picked up season 10, it comes with a little advert advertising season 11 (the final season) in November, 2006.

On the other side it says this:

""Announcing the ultimate MASH collector's set!

The Complete TV Series - All 11 Seasons PLUS

All-New Extras Not Available Anywhere Else!""

Over the past few years I've blown $300 on MASH DVDs with no extras to speak of. 6 months from now Fox will release a set that contains all the material I've already purchased plus new material they didn't see fit to include until the very end?

This doesn't seem right to me. Fox better have some kind of ""upgrade"" program for folks who have been buying the sets all along.",1148342400,27,666,4.508333333333334
