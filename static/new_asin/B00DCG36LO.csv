5788994,4,B00DCG36LO,"I bought several Hallmark movies this year, and all of them were good.  I have watched many movies since I watched this one.  I remember this one to be entertaining, well acted and well written.",1389139200,,194,4.514285714285714
5788995,5,B00DCG36LO,"Entertaining and delightful, this movie proves that one just never knows where or when love is going to come our way.",1382140800,3,117,4.619047619047619
5788996,5,B00DCG36LO,"All's Fair in Love & Advertising is a witty romantic comedy with a more serious underlying theme - ageism. When Tom (Steven Weber), a successful adman gets fired because he's on the wrong side of 50 and is unable to find another job, he hires a front, Dick, a fast-talking con man. Dick pretends to be a hotshot adman and gets hired at Tom's old agency. The scam works great - until both men fall for Harriet, a beautiful art director working at the agency. The actors are all charming and winning and the writing is clever and funny. If you're looking for a smart romantic comedy with something on its mind definitely see this movie!",1376438400,8,634,4.474137931034483

5788998,4,B00DCG36LO,It was a cute movie and great meaning. People like to count older people out but they are the ones who paved the way.,1405209600,,117,3.9166666666666665
5788999,5,B00DCG36LO,"Slightly different plot, which made this enjoyable.",1404691200,,51,6.428571428571429
5789000,5,B00DCG36LO,"This movie is true to life, about letting a person go, hiring some one younger.  But this movie is actually funny and clever also..  They work as a team, and they are both employed, good stars, and  some laughs.  You will like it......",1398470400,4,235,4.395348837209302
5789001,5,B00DCG36LO,"If you like Hallmark's style of romantic comedies, this is a fun addition to the library.  A nice, light hearted movie.",1397520000,2,119,4.666666666666667
5789002,4,B00DCG36LO,"pretty cute no brainer movie. Doesn't quite have the normal Hallmark standard, but enjoyed it just the same. Storyline does touch on a current themes.",1396137600,2,150,5.04
5789003,3,B00DCG36LO,"You usually never go wrong with a classic story & while this is not an exact remake, it's very similar to the classic Cyrano De Bergerac(remade as: Roxanne,The Truth About Cats & Dogs, etc..) in that: someone uses another person to pretend to be them in order to get what they want, & the girl falls in love with the talent,( the persona) not the person they are pretending to be. But,I did not like this movie. Steven Weber,(at 52),with his baggy eyes & ridiculous hair,(which rises up from a widow's peak like a huge M above his head !)would creep out a 30 year old love interest ! Though,Michelle Harrison looked a bit aged herself(for 30) The age difference would have been less creepy & more believable if they they had let her be her actual age in the movie,(which was 39 at the time it premiered).. AND not had her have such fake bright auburn hair that only someone under 25 could pull off!"" The message :"" don't judge a book by it's cover...or how long it's been in print <or even on the shelf> !"" is great, the chemistry, however, just didn't work. As charming as Andrew Francis was as the fake Ad man, his character was shallow, selfish & insincere. His transition from conman to ""yeah I'd let him date my daughter"", was unbelievable & abrupt...(& his invisible eyelashes need some mascara !) I Do applaud Hallmark for presenting some eclectic music as  the score....especially the cello in the coffee shop ! very much an improvement on the usual Hallmark tentative piano music <which unfortunately shows up near the end of the movie>...guess they ran out of $ for the music budget ? overall, it didn't work for me, and I'm in my 50's, so go figure.",1392336000,,1660,4.514950166112957
5789004,4,B00DCG36LO,"It was a good clean movie.  Liked that.  It had a pretty predictable plot, but did have a lesson to it.  In this world where beauty and youth seem to be what is valued, it was refreshing to see that experience and knowledge are still what makes things work.  Enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.",1391126400,,301,4.228070175438597
5789005,4,B00DCG36LO,"I usually expect to see sub-par acting when I watch a made-for-TV movie. If it's not big-budget, then what can you expect? But in this movie, all of the actors' performances were impressive. The storyline was original and it brought to light a topic that most Hallmark chick flicks don't cover: ageism. I would recommend it.",1390780800,2,324,4.803571428571429
5789006,5,B00DCG36LO,"this is a cute movie! was on TV titled: Dick, Jane and Harry..its a cute movie and fun to watch over and over. great DVD.",1389916800,,121,3.88
8591769,4,B00DCG36LO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is a little Cyrano De Bergerac meets ageism in the modern day world of business. The storyline is meaningful, but does a nice job balancing a serious issue with a lighter romance. Overall, it's a fun movie that I'd recommend to any fan of Hallmark movies.",1526428800,,291,4.615384615384615
8591770,5,B00DCG36LO,"I love all of this movie. A wonderful story of a man at the top of his game in the advertising industry who loses his job after the owner of the company he has worked at for over 20 years sells the company to Rave. At Rave it is all attitude and hip young players. They do not like him as he is over 50, gray haired and a few wrinkles. He is brilliant though. See what he does to get back in the game. This movie is funny, great soundtrack and full of funny scenes. A lot of Hallmark sweeties and full of attitude. The creativity is very inspiring. Ends very well. I love Steven Weber in anything. Andrew Francis is great here too. Enjoy!!",1519430400,2,639,4.079365079365079

8591774,5,B00DCG36LO,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It shows that a older person in some things still can have the edge over a younger person who does not have the answers to everything.,1430870400,,175,4.176470588235294
