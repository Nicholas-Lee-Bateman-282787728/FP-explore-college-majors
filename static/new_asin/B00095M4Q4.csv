This is by far the best tutorial DVD I have come across in the 3ds max or Photoshop area, and that includes using several that are much more expensive.  Although it is built around advanced processes, it was easy to follow, and taught me a number of techniques that I would never have learned from the current literature.  There is also the matter of the very few tutorials on how to use Photoshop specifically to create textures and maps for 3ds max.  I hope Andrew Britton will think about making more DVDs like this for that under-developed area.",1156291200,2,667,4.442622950819672
8342483,5,B00095M4Q4,"I have had the great pleasure and honor of being taught by Andrew Britton. For the past nine months I have been studying 3D Animation, requiring a large amount of Photoshop use.

The DVD was recommended to me by a previous student while we were discussing creating textures for 3D in Photoshop. I considered myself a reasonable Photoshop user, after all I have been building websites with it for a number of years. However, in the over nine hours of video that this DVD contains I have learned more than in past 3 to 5 years of Photoshop use.

There are tips on settings within Photoshop that will make you use of it far simpler and much more efficient, tips on keyboard shortcuts and interface use that you simply won't believe you managed to use Photoshop without them!

The content is well paced, easily followed and thorough. Containing many useful examples. I cannot recommend this tool highly enough.

If you ever get the chance to by taught by this gentleman, seize it with both hands, a true teacher in all mediums.

Thank you Andrew.",1147651200,4,1042,4.641304347826087
8342484,4,B00095M4Q4,"any photoshop user can benefit from this.  If you are completely new to texturing, then this is what you want for sure.  If you already know a bit about texturing with photoshop, then you should still get it as you will certianly find new ways and methods you can add to your own.  The examples consist of basically 2 tutorials, 1 really long wall texture, which offers some unique ways of going about things, and the other uses the pen tool, and shows how photoshop can do many of the same things as illustrator.  Alot of little tips/tricks along the way in this dvd that will help you in your own work.  Perfect for texturing in ways that are non-destructive in nature.  That is, you can use his methods to allow alot of changes/flexability after-the-fact.  Eg boss wants change, but you did not build with that in mind, ect...  The tutorials that you build are not all that great, but who cares, the process he takes you through to get them made and the techniques employed are high quality for sure.  Just apply what he shows to your own, that is the key.",1127174400,3,1059,4.44559585492228
