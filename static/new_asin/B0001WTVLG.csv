2034302,1,B0001WTVLG,"I turned it off after within about 20 minutes two guys had a ""rappelling race"" and a rope team untied on a glacier because they were bickering.  Not worth the watch if you've done any mountaineering.  Too much nonsense to allow for a willing suspension of disbelief.",1389398400,,266,4.638297872340425
2034303,4,B0001WTVLG,"It's a made for TV movie, so don't expect much. The acting is bad in places but it depicts high altitude climbing in a fairly realistic fashion. Plus it's based on a true story and there was no extra drama added. Would be boring for someone not into climbing though.",1388620800,,266,4.34
2034304,3,B0001WTVLG,"I've seen much better climbing adventure stories. This may be a true story, but I found it somewhat lackluster in its depiction of this climbing expedition. And not for nothin', the acting was really kind of terrible at times.",1387929600,2,226,4.82051282051282
2034305,3,B0001WTVLG,Does not rise above okay and at times falls below. There are better films - particularly if mountaineering is an interest.,1385078400,,122,4.857142857142857
2034306,5,B0001WTVLG,"I remember this movie from TV when I was in High School, I love it now the same as back then. A young Marcia Cross and Lori Singer really make this true story movie a must see.",1380412800,,176,3.7837837837837838
2034307,4,B0001WTVLG,"This is a well done film that follows a true story about climbing.  It is so much more realistic (it does have it's errors) than other hollywood films (verticle limit, cliffhanger, etc) that make climbing look to be a cross between ""mission impossible"" and ""demolition man"".  A lot of famous actors star in this film when they were young and unknown.  Worth watching, especially if your interested in climbing.",1313712000,7,410,4.913043478260869
2034308,4,B0001WTVLG,We personally know Molly Higgins. Lori Singer did a good j0b of acting and stands about a foot taller than Molly. This is a great movie- great scenery and very well done.,1084147200,3,170,4.34375
2034309,5,B0001WTVLG,I only watch movies with Lori in it. This was great because she made the whole show.,925516800,,84,4.0
2034339,1,B0001WTVLG,"DON'T waste your time on this pitiful contrivance. Quite possibly the worst film of its kind--and possibly of any kind-- I've ever endured. Terrible acting, foolish behavior unfit for the members of any expedition, neanderthal attitudes and sexist commentary on the part of almost everyone depicted. A terrible misrepresentation of the truth and an insult to the international climbing community.",1449619200,2,396,5.616666666666666
2034340,3,B0001WTVLG,somewhat realistic and entertaining.,1444867200,,36,8.25
2034341,4,B0001WTVLG,she got to do what she wanted to do. we should like wise. love it,1442361600,,65,3.4
2034342,3,B0001WTVLG,"Not a great story or acting, but the scenery is beautiful.  I don't care to see it again.",1436745600,,89,3.9444444444444446
2034343,2,B0001WTVLG,Just mediocre.,1433030400,,14,6.5
2034344,3,B0001WTVLG,"Old movie and the acting is challenged by todays standards, but it was worth the time spent I think.",1430438400,,100,4.315789473684211
2034345,3,B0001WTVLG,It was just alright.  Story needs to flow better.,1430006400,,49,4.444444444444445
2034346,3,B0001WTVLG,"I enjoyed it for the scenery, but the climbing was unrealistic in a perilous way and there are no 24,000 ft peaks in Russia.",1427241600,,124,4.208333333333333
2034347,4,B0001WTVLG,"If you're into mountaineering, you'll appreciate this flick. I liked looking at all the retro-gear. Despite other reviewer's complaints about the quality of cinematography I found it above average. I actually did not think the acting was terrible, I've experienced some of the situations this film depicts and found it believable.",1425772800,,330,5.490196078431373
2034348,4,B0001WTVLG,"Solid movie, a bit simplified, a bit dramatized, but it shows the challenge and shows the choices to be made",1424736000,,108,4.45
2034359,1,B0001WTVLG,"I think that I can honestly now say that I have seen the worst movie ever made (and, yes, I have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space). The climbing scenes were NOT good, as some have suggested, but mountaineering scenes were grotesquely absurd.  I can never have that time back, and for that I am sorry. Do not make the same mistake that I did.",1421107200,2,337,4.184615384615385
2034360,1,B0001WTVLG,"having read the riveting  Book Storm and Sorrow in the Pamirs, I found this movie to border on the lame. The whole concept of Woman proving herself is really stale. There are a lot of great women mountaineers who are accepted for what they are: climbers. I rank it right down there with Into Thin Air made for TV",1419897600,2,312,4.288135593220339
2034361,4,B0001WTVLG,"It's a low budget made-for-TV film -so let's review it with the correct and fair context -I think previous reviewers are a bit harsh on the film for what it is.  Sure there are some less than average acting performances, annoying and unnecessary voice overs, and lack of ambient sound in places which swallows your attention at times but I found the film to be quite entertaining -as I love climbing films and they are in short supply.  I thought the self arrest and Jumar rescue scene was shot in a compelling manner.  And just learning a little more about   aka Elvira Shatayev and the Russian Women's climbing team's 1974 disaster is worth your time if your in to climbing. If you can make it through the first 20 minutes (intro Voice Over and Mt Ranier scenes) -you will likely find this to be a compelling and dramatic climbing film.",1416355200,,838,4.56
2034362,2,B0001WTVLG,To slow for me.,1416182400,,15,3.0
2034363,2,B0001WTVLG,"The performances by the main actors (including Lori Singer's) was appalling. The story deserved better and I think there was room for a better depiction of it, the acting nonetheless.",1404950400,,183,5.133333333333334
2034364,2,B0001WTVLG,"Poor acting, badly filmed, implausible story line, not really about climbing at all.  With all of the excellent climbing films out there, this one goes in the trash.",1399852800,2,165,4.892857142857143
2034365,1,B0001WTVLG,"ugh. I'd recommend  these climbing films, try Touching the Void, Norwand (The North Face), and even Eiger Sanction. On belay",1399420800,,124,5.2
2034366,4,B0001WTVLG,"I remembered this story from years ago and enjoyed the film version.  It's based on fact; a group of American climbers were among an international group invited into Russia just after they opened the borders, to climb the Pamir mountain range.  It ended in tragedy for several teams as severe storms moved in and killed the entire Russian women's climbing team along with several other climbers.  Don't know if every detail in the film was accurate -- probably not -- but as I recall it the gist of the story is true.  And there's some magnificent mountain scenery and a taste of what conditions must be like for those intrepid adventurers.",1398038400,,640,4.738738738738738
2034367,4,B0001WTVLG,"I am not a climber, so I can't vouch for any techniques or decisions on a mountain.  The only thing I have to complain about is the part on the mountain where I could tell it was filmed indoors--too much echo and ""indoor' noise.  Otherwise, a scenario that could definitely happen.",1395792000,,281,4.490196078431373
2034368,1,B0001WTVLG,I give this movie a poor rating because it refused to load properly. I even tried different systems. Thus it was miserable to watch the same thirty minutes over and over again.,1390867200,,176,4.53125
8017075,2,B0001WTVLG,this is the second DVD I have gotten and both have problems in them. the first one my son got about 2 years ago skips and stops in the middle of viewing. this one I just got skips a place in about the middle of watching. love the movie just disappointed.,1497657600,,254,4.0
8017076,5,B0001WTVLG,"One of the greatest climbing movies available,. it's right at the top.",1489190400,,70,4.916666666666667

8017078,1,B0001WTVLG,Campy and dated might have been interesting in the 90's but I doubt it.,1482537600,,71,4.142857142857143
8017079,5,B0001WTVLG,It's a older movie but certainly held my attention. I enjoy mountain climbing and the challenge men and women need to face to meet their dream head on.,1478563200,,151,4.428571428571429
8017080,1,B0001WTVLG,"The worst Everest expedition movie ever made. Nothing about this film is correct, nothing. Silent avalanches, trees on Everest (above base camp), Walmart camping equipment. If you are in any way a serious mountaineer, you will be appalled by this film. Big waste of time.",1475193600,2,271,5.044444444444444

8017082,2,B0001WTVLG,"older movie, poor quality, marginal acting, simple story line.",1464652800,,62,6.0
8017083,3,B0001WTVLG,The acting wasn't all that great...the sound was messed up...they should have shown more of the actual climbing...but it was a good story.,1462579200,,138,5.043478260869565
8017084,2,B0001WTVLG,"SPOILER ALERT: In one word, awful.  I gave it two stars... one for content and one for effort.  And that's more than this movie deserves.  I'm a fan of mountaineering movies, I've seen many, but I have never see one so quiet.  Because this was ""fact-based"" and made in 1990, I tried to be a little lenient in my criticism, but I couldn't, there's no excuse for making a movie this bad.  Here are the facts:

1. It's quiet.  There's almost no music in the movie at all.  No warning music to let you know that the avalanches (2) were coming.  No suspenseful sounds letting you know danger is afoot.  No rushing, rumbling snow sound.  In fact, at the first avalanche you see the actors all standing around on the hill looking upward and all around and you're wondering what the hell they're looking for.  But if you've seen enough such movies, you know an avalanche must be coming.  Only problem is, the next second you see them running, in complete silence, and then they're ""buried"" in snow. You never even see snow fall on them. But amazingly, they're ""buried"" in such a way that they literally stand up and walk out of the packed snow.  Everyone finds and retrieves their bags and then continues to walk down, as if by magic, off the mountain.  Which bring me to complain number 2.
2. Where was the technical climbing?  Where was the struggle?  They quite literally appeared to ""walk"" up the mountain, barely breathing hard, and then are standing on this rocky summit top.  But you never see them actually ""climb"" the rocks.  They just appear on top like magic.  Terrible.
3. If the acting was bad, the audio/visual was worse.  They must have had just one mic and one camera.  A good portion of the dialogue was voice-over, and the still shots of the mountain I'm sure was a backdrop.  You saw one or two aerial shots, but for most of the movie the camera was in so tight on the actors that you knew they were on a set for most of the filming.  Just terrible.
4. Then there's the antiquated 1960's attitude toward women.  The mountain scenes open with a cute blonde washing the ""Boys"" clothes in the freezing water hole, then later she's prancing around in tight, high-waist jeans and a crop top.  Seriously?  Even in 1960 this would have been insulting.  But this movie was made in 1990 and while women weren't jumping at the chance to climb mountains, we had made more strides than this movie gave us credit for. At one point the blonde actually insinuated that in order to get anywhere in this ""man's"" world of climbing, you have to play this game and advance on the boot straps of the men.  I know it was true way back when, but seriously?  I felt like I was watching a 1970's Lifetime Television for Women movie.

In Summary, it was a disappointment, but like any tragic accident, it was too hard to look away from.  I watched til the end and I simply can't un-see what I've seen.",1460419200,4,2886,4.448473282442748
