7973097,5,B00006SFK9,"Unlike mentioned in a previous review, those are 2 totally different movies. One is the iconic SB film which feature Ti Lung, Fu Sheng & the Venom mob...the movie that gives you the classic line, ""On guard, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style"" which is made famous by the rap group Wu Tang Clan. THAT IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!

If you're looking to turn your brain off & enjoy about 90 minutes worth of nonstop kung fu action then this is a movie worthy of seeing. While it doesn't have ""notable"" stars in it, it does have Bruce Leung (My12 Kung Fu Kicks, The Fists the Kicks & the Evil, Hong Kong Superman, Broken Oath) & Jason Pai Piao (Funny Kung Fu, Shaolin Intruders, Shaolin Prince, Shaolin Rescuers, Supreme Swordsman, Magnificent Kick, Demon Strike). Also among the 10 Tigers were the underrated Larry Lee, Wong Yuen San, Hon Kwok Choi & Michelle Lai (yes, a woman!). The plot revolves around one of the disciples' wife being kidnapped by an evil lord which sets up a showdown involving other evil factions (one of which headed by Chiang Tao) against the Tigers.

Whether it's hand to hand or with weapons, everyone gets their fight on. If you are a fan of the genre & enjoy these films, this one will not disappoint!

Side note: one line I found hilarious was the inner dialogue one of the baddies had after being defeated by Bruce Leung when he says ""you are much too powerful for me now I'll admit that, but next time I wouldn't be so sure."" LOL!!!",1491350400,,1462,4.407407407407407

I really like Enter The Dragon compared to this.(of course oranges to apples).",1280275200,,289,4.8

7973102,5,B00006SFK9,"AKA 10 Tigers Of Kwangtung.

What I have noticed about this flick,,,it has several names. The original name for this flick is "" 10 tigers From Kwangtung"",(SEE DETAILS IN GOOGLE.COM) ""10 Tigers From Kwingtung"",AKA ""10 Tigers from shaolin"". When this movie was reviewed under the original name,"" 10 tigers From Kwangtung"",it got a 5 star, and when reviewed under the name ""10 Tigers from Shaolin"",,it only got 3 stars. Now this is a little disconcerting to me as it appears most people, SO CALLED KUNG FU LOVERS tend grade or rate movies, based on what others have to say! That is extremely sad I think, since I usually buy kung fu movies based on my Amazon colleagues!! THIS MOVIE OVER-ALL WAS AMAZING, and deserve nothing less than 5 stars. I recommend it highly!! So those who graded it 3 Stars, are all IDIOTS AND FOLLOWERS,,,,,,I never liked followers, they usually make me ill!!!",1149811200,,883,4.771241830065359
7973103,3,B00006SFK9,"There aren't many name actors in TEN TIGERS OF SHAOLIN (1979), but the performers are all quite good and the fights well staged, culminating in a final battle that takes up the last 25 minutes of an 85-minute film and involves at least two dozen principal players fighting with fists, feet, sticks, knives and swords in an open field.

The lead actor is Bruce Leung, who has fortunately been rediscovered thanks to Stephen Chow's KUNG FU HUSTLE, in which he plays an institutionalized kung fu master known as ""the Beast,"" who is broken out of an asylum to fight the hidden masters of Pig Sty Alley. Leung was quite a busy actor and fight director in the good ol' days of old-school kung fu and it was the 2005 release of KUNG FU HUSTLE which inspired me to seek out his earlier films. In TEN TIGERS, he's one of the title group of kung fu fighters and gets to battle early and often, starting with the opening fight sequence. There are other familiar faces in the solid kung fu cast, although the only other ""name"" player is Jason Pai Piao (HELL'S WINDSTAFF, SHAOLIN RESCUERS).

The simple plot has to do with the Ten Tigers running afoul of a corrupt official who, at various points, kidnaps one or another of the Ten Tigers' women, prompting a series of escalating encounters culminating in the huge brawl at the end. The action is frequent and furious and certain to please hardcore kung fu fans. And it is a pleasant surprise to see the earlier work of one of the key performers from KUNG FU HUSTLE.

Ground Zero's DVD of TEN TIGERS boasts print quality and a video transfer that are much better than average for this company.",1114819200,2,1630,4.537414965986395
