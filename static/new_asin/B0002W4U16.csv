2128210,3,B0002W4U16,"Prey

With a title like ""Prey"" one would expect this British sci-fi horror film to either be very bloody or very lurid. In this case, it's both.  A cannibal alien from outer space on a reconnaissance mission to Earth drops in on the estate of a wealthy, eccentric British lesbian and her neurotic woman-child live-in girlfriend. Now how can anyone possibly go wrong starting with a premise like that? It has the feel of a Merchant-Ivory film adapted by Roger Corman (or maybe a Roger Corman film adapted by Merchant-Ivory?) As added attractions, the women are erotic and beautiful and the music, for some reason, is awfully nice in parts. A great B-movie.

Prey isn't for all tastes, but for the game British sci-fi or horror fan it's a great treat.",1247356800,4,749,4.702290076335878

The girls dress him up as a woman, which does not seem to affect him in the least, but provides us with a truly strange yet successful film. The story, which borrows from such various sources as THE MAN WHO FELL ON EARTH (Roeg), CUL-DE-SAC (Polanski) and STRAW DOGS (Peckinpah), is clever enough to take on board such themes as racism, sexism, love, jealousy and betrayal. With just three characters, an unusual setting and a fittingly realistic treatment, it makes for a very intriguing experience. Norman J. Warren's best ?",1211155200,4,633,4.711711711711712
2128212,2,B0002W4U16,"LOL at ""gore-soaked"" remark as this movie has very little gore at all. Most of the gore itself is unconvincing and laughable. I guess Norman thought less is more by shooting the death scenes (without showing the killing itself of the two policemen). If you know a little about the B-Movies Norman has done from ""Inseminoid"" and ""Bloody New Year) (two cheesy classics) then you know what to expect from this movie.

The acting is at least passable. The suspense is there but could have a better payoff. Other scenes are just badly put together like the ""rescue"" of the alien which comes across as hilarious with the cheesy 70's music. There is at least some nudity and sex but not nearly enough to warrant repeated viewings of this movie.

The movie has a 4.9 score on IMDB which is typically what any Norman J. Warren movies gets (below average score) still if you are in the mood for a different type of alien movie (that is more geared toward drama since the two lesibans take up a bulk of the screen time) than anything else) this might be for you. Otherwise avoid it.",1198281600,,1071,4.515463917525773
2128213,4,B0002W4U16,"British goremeister Norman J. Warren's THE PREY is actually a retelling of D.H. Lawrence's classic novelle, THE FOX.

Lawrence's THE FOX is about a young man who intrudes upon a lesbian couple's cozy world, creating a tense love triangle.  There's also an actual fox, a metaphor for the man's entry into their world.

THE PREY has it all, including the fox.  Only, in THE PREY, the young man happens to be an alien who occassionally kills (turns out he likes the taste of human flesh).

At the end, the film diverges from the book.  Still, it's interesting seeing an old literary classic recast into a sci-fi gorefest.",1110585600,4,618,4.728971962616822
2128214,4,B0002W4U16,"The above description of the movie is a little misleading; by no means would I describe it as ""gore-soaked"" although there are a couple bloody scenes.  Basically this is a British film from 1978 about an alien who lands on Earth and assumes human form.  He stumbles upon a house occupied by a lesbian couple, who assume he is some kind of halfwit and let him stay awhile.  I remember seeing this one on video under the title ""Alien Prey,"" with the front cover being a big-time spoiler of the one gory scene in the movie!  I rented the DVD, expecting a big gorefest, but instead got a reasonably good, occasionally slow movie with effectively weird moments.

This film was directed by Norman J. Warren, whose interview is also featured on the DVD.  Apparently there is a Warren boxset in the works featuring four of his films: Prey, Inseminoid (Horror Planet), and two others.  In the interview, Warren mentions previous softcore sex films that he's done; in fact, Prey features a fair amount of nudity and a really hot lesbian sex scene.  The erotic tension underlying the relationship between the two lesbians and the alien guy is pretty well-communicated here: the ""butch"" is quite jealous of the alien's designs on her more feminine companion.  The whole movie takes place in and around the women's secluded country home; as expected, it looks all to be shot on a shoestring budget but doesn't really suffer for it.  It's well-photographed, with decent, understated performances from the actors and simple dialogue.  Not a penny wasted here.  And what an ending!

I'd recommend this film for anyone who likes low-budget sleaze and weirdness, especially you freaks who are into 70's softcore sex films.  I was pleasantly surprised even though I expected something a little more ""gore-soaked.""",1102464000,9,1794,4.916943521594685

8033602,4,B0002W4U16,Weird ass 70's British alien movie with badass payoff at the end. It was a little slow and talky but i couldn't stop watching it. Give it a shot. The commentary track is very informative.,1495497600,2,187,4.371428571428571
8033603,4,B0002W4U16,"ALIEN PREY (aka: PREY) opens w/ an extraterrestrial visitor killing a man named Anders (Barry Stokes), assuming his identity, then snapping his girlfriend's spine like a dry twig! Meanwhile, Josephine (Sally Faulkner) and Jessica (Glory Annen) work on their relationship at their nearby villa. Enter Anders into their lives, causing problems almost immediately. Jessica thinks he's quite odd, while Josephine believes that all men are odd. Things really heat up when Anders mutilates a pair of nose-y coppers. When he's not eliminating humans, he's wiping out the local wildlife. Will Jo and Jess discover his true identity? Can they possibly survive his murderous lust? ALIEN PREY is a somewhat silly British horror film from 1981. However, it does have its moments of tension and suspense, in spite of Anders' ludicrous alien make-up. The weird factor zooms into the stratosphere once the dead-fox / cross-dressing / hide and-go-seek bash begins! In addition, we get the world's biggest knife, the slow-motion duck pond flopping sequence, and the gore-tastic finale! Of course, there's also the obligatory Jo / Jess love scene to appeal to our basic instincts. My goodness, but those two do get up to some mischief! Ahem... Where was I? Oh yeah, um... Never mind...",1432944000,4,1267,5.215686274509804
8033604,4,B0002W4U16,"Underappreciated bit of '70s Brit horror. Very well-done and ""tightly"" done - only a handful of characters with the action and relationships all centered around a remote country house.",1425772800,,184,5.379310344827586

8033607,2,B0002W4U16,"According to IS IT UNCUT magazine #6, this is missing 11 seconds. I've seen the Comet VHS tape and have also seen the ending on a movie called TERROR ON TAPE which is a compilation of horror clips. The ending gore sequence on this DVD ( the only gore scene that's shown on-screen) is noticeably shortened. There's some other gore scenes in the film, but you just see the aftermath. This censoring of this gruesome and effective sequence damages the film. The movie itself is about a lesbian couple who encounter an alien in human form. They allow the man who appears to be injured to stay with them at there exquisite mansion that's isolated in the forest. When he transforms into the alien, only his nose, eyes and teeth change; he doesn't really look like an alien. There's some topless and rear nudity, as well as a little bit of full frontal during the violent ending sex sequence. A lesbian scene is shown, but it's dimly lit. The film has a low body count, is talky in some parts, and it basically concentrates on filming the forest locations along with the rich mansion and providing character development with these 3 people. It's interesting the way that they develop a relationship with this guy who is clearly strange and not sane. I thought the directing was good because I like Norman J Warren, but it's a slow film that is also cut towards the end.

The DVD quality overall is very good, but I thought it could've been a little brighter. You also get a director's interview. I've seen that this film has been released again by Redemption, but I don't know if it's complete for sure because I've never watched it. The British censors typically cut sexually violent scenes, so it might be exactly the same. This review is for the 2004 Image DVD release.

Here's an update. I recently got the uncut Blu-ray from VINEGAR SYNDROME. The quality is fantastic. It looks like a whole new movie. That lesbian sequence is now so bright and clear, and it reveals some full frontal nudity. The ending gore sequence is now fully uncut. This release gets 5 stars. The great quality lets you get a nice look at all the scenery and nudity, as well as the gore. The excellent quality is important for a film like this because of the locations and nude scenes. I personally thought it was a really involving film now, and it didn't seem to me like it was slow moving anymore. The menu screen has animation and sound, and the extras are all good.",1385164800,5,2440,4.543181818181818
8033608,3,B0002W4U16,"An alien (Barry Stokes) meat eater lands on earth and takes human form as one of his victims. He is taken in as a house guest in an English country manor by a pair of lesbians. The two women are a bit odd. Jessica (Glory Annen) the not too shy owner of the estate inherited it from her parents. Jo (Sally Faulkner) worked there and stayed on as the alpha female in the relationship.

The alien is socially inept. Jessica is fond of him, ""He's very attractive...for a man"" to the dismay of Jo who suspects something is up. The film has slow scenes and takes time to build up to a climax that wasn't worth the wait. Low budget soft core sci-fi from the 70's. A drive-in movie flick.

8033610,4,B0002W4U16,"This story revolves around three figures. There are two women who are in a lesbian relationship. The younger girl owns the house that is outside of England. Her crazy lover is just that, crazy. She is crazy and very paranoid that her lover will move on to England to meet other women, men, whoever. The older crazy female even kills a neighborhood man who had come to visit the two women. Later the younger female finds a huge knife and some bloody clothing that had belonged to the victim in the other girls belongings. So by that point she knows she has to carefully get out of the lesbian relationship.

Enter the ALIEN. The ALIEN can physically assume the form and identity of another person or being. As soon as the alien enters the human environment he kills a guy who is making out with a girl in a car near the lesbian's house. The ALIEN then assumes the male identity. Later two policemen are dispatched to look for the missing man and find the car. The ALIEN unknowingly walks up to the crime scene and then flees from the policemen. In a struggle the ALIEN kills the policemen. Later in the film we find that the alien is indeed a meat eater, or call him a cannibal. The alien kills some rabbits, some chicken, a fox and finally the girls' pet parrot.

The older female is indeed whacked out and we find at the end of the movie that she had been confined to a mental facility. The younger girl is convinced that the alien is also from a mental institution because he is so strange. Proving this strangeness, at one point the alien jumped into a pond after a goose only to find that he had no idea what WATER really is. He panicked and started to drown. The alien is indeed bizarre and this is accentuated later when the girls clad him up in a dress, lipstick and so on. The ALIEN didn't know what water is, how to dance, how to kiss. The ALIEN didn't have a name or how old he was, or where he was from or where he was going. The ALIEN just let the young girl fill in the blanks for him. He would just take a cue from her and nod along. This is a trippy movie. The lesbianism isn't very exciting. The possessive crazy older girl makes love to the younger girl but mostly the lovemaking is one sided, so it isn't very erotic at all. I guess the older woman didn't have a great body because they just focused on nude scenes with the younger girl. The young girl also did look quite young for a love scene. I would think she was just only about the age of consent for being nude on film. She might have been between 17 and 18. Watch this movie for the crazy older lesbian and the quiet creepy alien guy.",1340755200,5,2611,4.240963855421687
