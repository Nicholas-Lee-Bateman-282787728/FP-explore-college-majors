8064803,5,B0009OUC6O,"Having seen all the Lynley mysteries, this episode is among the most memorable. A few red herrings, a twist here, an unexpected revelation there, good acting and a bit of a shocker at the end.

Don't normally purchase individual TV episodes, but I made an exception here.",1200355200,2,271,4.76595744680851
