6424755,5,B00KFP64RI,"I saw this at a film festival and it is easily the best LGBT movie I've ever seen.  I felt like sexuality was not the star of the movie, but instead these great actors portrayed growing up, striving for independence and struggling with disability and sexuality was a component of these things, like they are for any given adolescent.  It was amazing and I would definitely watch it again.",1405987200,57,388,4.608695652173913
6424756,4,B00KFP64RI,"The Way He Looks paints a pretty convincing if perhaps naive image of high school romance, between the blind, overprotected Leo and the country boy Gabrielle.  The film presents teenagers who play 'the kissing game' (spin the bottle), dance politely to David Bowie, and sip vodka out of paper cups.  It is far flung from Harmony Korine's 'kids' or probably most of the teenagers of this generation.  But the idealism does effectively capture a feeling of youth---where romance, desire and friendship are all tangled into one intense connection.

What really saves the film though is how Daniele Roebiro and the cast bring out these tender feelings without getting saccharine or grandiose about it.  This isn't the tradition angsty art house coming of age film, nor is it a statement about gay love overcoming the odds.  The story beats are provincial: Leo and Gabrielle going to a see a movie, and Gabrielle providing Leo a play by play of what's happening on screen.  If the images are polished, what happens is regular.

If there is a criticism to be held against the film it might be simply that it feels too slight for some viewers.  It doesn't pack the emotional wallop of the short film---which condenses many of the same story into a tight package.  But it also delivers the 'goods' the short's fans were yearning for---a true reconciliation between Leo and Gabrielle in lieu of the anonymous kiss cliffhanger, more on screen kissing in general (in fact the 'blind kiss' story device is reinvented in a different way) and even a shower scene!  It is a great compliment to the short film.  For young gay people this is the romance they will love to watch because it is normal.",1405209600,26,1682,4.782006920415225
6424757,4,B00KFP64RI,"This is Daniel Ribeiro's theatrical version of his short, ""I Do not Want to Go Back Alone"" ( Eu No Quero Voltar Sozinho ). It retells the original short's story while expanding the world in which it takes place is. The original short was a touching, and heart warming coming of age tale. The theatrical version stars the same cast with Ghilherme Lobo playing Leo, a blind teen, again his performance is exceptional and the expanded details of his family and school life help set it apart from just a retelling of the short. Leo's best friend, Giovana, played by Tess Amorim, is something of an unrequited love and some what frustrated that Leo is quite literally blind to her affections. When a transfer student, Gabriel, played by Fabio Audi, arrives Giovana and several other girls from Leo's school find themselves biding for Gabriel's attention. All the while Leo continues to deal with bullies, his over protective mother, as well as his own developing friendship with Gabriel. It's a touching and well plotted coming of age, as well as coming out story that will just melt your heart.",1404000000,59,1090,4.803191489361702

8658226,5,B00KFP64RI,"May be too innocent or adolescent for some. However, this movie  which is more about vulnerability than about coming out  really captured my heart.",1518998400,,147,5.083333333333333
8658227,4,B00KFP64RI,"Nicely done -- character development A+ and woven around a gentle, sweet storyline.  Very believable -- the young actors are totally natural, the development is easy and not forced or contrived, which can easily be a pitfall in this subject matter. The adding the angst of each of the characters keeps the focus on how difficult it is to understand and deal with one's own sexuality, be it gay or straight is a great choice and keeps the theme very universal rather than making it as something only gays deal with.  Well worth the watch.",1518912000,,537,4.6421052631578945
8658228,4,B00KFP64RI,"This is a sweet coming of age movie which takes awhile to develop. More of the film focuses on Leo's relationship with is parents and trying to make it on his own than his relationship with Gabriel. In fact while it is a gay themed movie, that is very much secondary. As a blind high school student, Leo struggles both with bullying at school and with finding some independence at home. The acting and writing was decent, making it feel authentic. I would've liked to have seen the relationship with Gabriel develop more perhaps considering the movie title. And while the description says ""set against the music of Belle and Sebastian"", they only use maybe 2 of their songs.",1514764800,,674,4.6722689075630255
