Music sounds so serious at times and don't relate to the emotions.",1338422400,,154,4.961538461538462
2806968,5,B000P0I4NU,"This isn't a favorite or anything, but it's different and it's good. :) It really makes you wonder about who you trust though, my God. If I were Jordan, I would have felt like dying, everything must have been so confusing for him.",1318896000,,230,4.372093023255814

2806971,5,B000P0I4NU,"I truly enjoyed this movie.  Good acting, great story, a bit of film Noir!!

Recommend this purchase as you will want to watch this DVD a few times just for the neat story twist.",1233446400,,178,4.205882352941177
2806972,4,B000P0I4NU,"I don't think many would say this is a great movie, but it does have a few qualities that would make it of interest to traditional values families.  The first is the language; I can recall only one instance of any kind of objectionable language.  Considering many of today's movies, that is a welcome relief.  There is one passing scene pertaining to sex, but it clearly is not the focus of the move.  This, in spite of the fact that Jordan was kicked out of his prep school for taking glamour photos of some of the girls.

At its core, this is a movie about lying and about making good decisions, even as a teenager.  The first homicide occurred when Shay's married 'boyfriend' started to attack her and Jordan rushes to her rescue.  Next thing you know, Jordan is on the ground being beaten by the adult man.  Shay grabs a small log and hits the adult on his head, killing him.  Clearly, this would be classified as self defense, something as wealthy a kid as Jordan's lawyer could have won if they were even charged.  Instead of doing the right thing, Jordan and Shay try to cover up the death.  Thus begins a 'need' to lie over and over again, until the end of the movie.  Parents who show this movie to their teens would have a great opportunity to point out how making the wrong choice creates one mess after another.

It is refreshing to see a 'suspense' movie nearly devoid of bad language or hyped sex.  And, make no mistake about it, most people, especially teens, would probably find this to be as suspenseful as any similar movie.  I am grading it down one level because the unexpected ending, while very clever, would not be the action that a person of high character would do.",1231372800,2,1690,4.441558441558442
2806973,1,B000P0I4NU,"Okay, how did I start watching this picture?  I liked the title, which refers to a certain shade of lipstick or nail polish favored by the heroine, Shay Bettencourt (Nikki Reed) which attracts the boy she wants, wealthy young preppy Jordan (Jonathan Tucker).  Jordan's insistent neo-noir narration plays continually over the pretty pictures CHERRY CRUSH delivers, and you get tired of him saying over and over again, ""A good photographer captures his subject,"" significant pause, while the camera pans over 4,000 more vacuous shots of Shay in prim lingerie--then the capper, ""But a good subject captures her photographer.""  Staccato burst of horns.  It makes sense, sort of, but it depends on chemistry, and Tucker and Reed are no William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.  Oh what a mess this movie is, on every level.  Number one, it was ludicrous to set this noir thriller in high school.

I know, I know, BRICK did it well, but BRICK was more a story of gangsters and turf and money, whereas CHERRY CRUSH wants to revel in the whole forbidden love POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE thing.  It still could work, maybe, but why hire Jonathan Tucker to play a high school student?  The guy looks like he's about 40 and a CPA.  When he's sitting next to Frank Whaley at a bar, Whaley looks younger.  Well, he wasn't directed to keep an absolutely deadpan face with no expression, whereas Tucker looks as though they injected curare into his facial muscles every morning at the beginning of the shoot.  There's a whole plot in which Jordan is supposed to be on the working board of a huge arts organization in order for his CV to look good when he applies to Cornell.  Jordan (and his girlfriend, equally late 30ish, but apparently also supposed to be 17) is thrust into heavy million dollar fundraising, well, I don't think so.  Why even have that plot, it is so ludicrous.  There must be a million other ways to show Jordan at the mercy of a powerful Ari-Gold type of dad who rules him with an iron glove, so that we should sympathize with his need to be free in some aspect of his wealthy young life, even if it means picking up the trashiest girl in town and becoming part of her web of sin, lies and murder.

The biggest problem is Nikki Reed as the vamp--totally inadequate.  She looks like a little girl trying on mommy's wedding gown.",1229904000,3,2326,4.62043795620438
2806974,4,B000P0I4NU,"_Cherry Crush_ is probably not a movie I would normally watch. I have certainly never reviewed anything like it before on Amazon.com. I found it really cheap and figured it might be at least as entertaining as other movies such as _Cruel Intentions_, focusing on intrigue, webs of lies, betrayal, and perhaps real crime. I knew from the movie's description that there was a murder, so I figured it might be interesting.

 The basic premise is that Jordan Wells, a teenager of wealthy parents is expelled in the opening of the movie from an expensive private school for taking nude photographs of his female classmates (fair warning, a few of these photos are briefly shown, they are artistic, nothing I thought offensive, are relevant to the story, and there is no more nudity in the rest of the film). Though he committed no crime, the school's dean and administrators decide they had no further options and force him to leave the school.

 Jordan enrolled in the local high school and became entranced by a beautiful student he meets there by the name of Shay Bettencourt, a woman unlike the other girls at the high school or from Jordan's previous school. She is intelligent, opinionated, a bit of an outsider, and mysterious. Before too long Jordan and Shay end up together, Jordan wanting to photograph Shay, Shay wanting to use Jordan for her own ends.

 As the movie progresses bit by bit Jordan finds more and more about Shay. The first time they spend any time outside of class, Jordan gives Shay a ride home. It turns out though that that was not Shay's home at all; Shay shares an appeasement with a rather unsavory sister. Though a bit out of the norm for Jordan - and Shay worried that her ""wrong side of the tracks"" background might scare off her new boyfriend - Jordan is enamored with the lovely Shay, despite the fact that she is not all that she appears to be.

 What appealed to me the most about the movie was that Jordan, a pretty normal if privileged boy, is falling in love with a woman clearly outside of his normal social circles (not merely in terms of how much money she has either). He finds that several times she either lied to him or omitted mentioning certain things, but each time he discovered the truth, he believed her when she said that she merely wanted to avoid scaring him away. After a time though he begins wonder; was it just that, or is there some deeper agenda? Is she just using him for what he can do for her, perhaps a pleasant enough companion but only useful up to a point, or does she really love him? Shay seemed to care for Jordan but as Jordan got further and further into her world the word ""baggage"" does not even begin to cover it, as Jordan's world apparently encompasses blackmail, fraud, and eventually murder. Does Jordan stick with the woman he loves - and feels responsible for - or does he back away, perhaps frightened of her, perhaps merely wanting to protect himself, a very real concern when certain lines are crossed? Is wanting to be with this girl worth it, at great risk to his future, his liberty, even his life?

 The movie might sound like a romance, and in some ways it is, but to me it was a more a movie of intrigue, murder, and deception; a thriller basically. I thought the acting was good, Shay was certainly someone that would tempt most men, and the twists and turns of her slowly revealed background and life story  were interesting.",1224633600,25,3417,4.54885993485342
2806975,3,B000P0I4NU,"I just watched this movie with some friends and it's mediocre at best.  The is a ok story that somewhat keeps your attention but it's something you would see on tv.  The movie in not high calliber in anyway, heck it wasn't really even that sensual.....but is it worth a watch? sure",1185494400,2,281,4.384615384615385
2806986,2,B000P0I4NU,"This film is not usually the kind of movie that I go for, but I decided to watch it, for it's star, Jonathan Tucker. He is one of my favorite actors, and this is one of the few films, he's done, that I hadn't seen yet. The story begins with Jordan Wells (Tucker) in trouble with both the police and his private school. It was discovered that Wells had been taking nude photos of several of the girls, and the school was deciding whether or not to press charges. They don't, but the well-to-do teen is sent to finish his senior year at public school. Once there he meets the girls of his dreams, a girl he thinks will change his life, but she's not all she appears to be. For starters, the cast of this film was way to old to be believable as High School students and the story really didn't match the setting. This was a story of love, hate, betrayal, and murder, involving wealthy, well to do people. Setting the story in the context of a High School romance did it a huge disservice. The story itself wasn't bad, just slow at certain points, but the setting just turned me off to the whole thing right from the beginning. Jonathan Tucker does the tremendous job I've come to expect from him. It doesn't matter the role or type of film, but somehow this guy always manages to get audiences to like him. It's Tucker's charisma and connection to the audience that keeps me watching, even when it's a film like this, that I really wasn't into. Cherry Crush basically has nothing going for it, except for it's star, who does his best to try and save a film that just doesn't work.",1393545600,,1577,4.331081081081081
2806987,4,B000P0I4NU,"It kept me interesting, so many lies, I could have easily fell into Shay's trap as well.
Really good ;) and Jordan is so lucky. I wish to have a friend like D one day, not cover crimes, but to always be in contact with ;).",1391644800,,222,3.847826086956522
2806988,1,B000P0I4NU,Terrible. Poor acting. Poor story. A waste of time and braincells. Turned it off.  Couldn't take the torture. Better options.,1389657600,,125,5.25

2806990,1,B000P0I4NU,I did not watch this movie after reading the pre view I must have hit the wrong button to make it start playing.,1388620800,,112,3.9130434782608696
2806991,5,B000P0I4NU,"I would recommend this movie to others because I enjoyed it. I love how he loved the bad girl, but the bad girl loved him too. It was like the bad girl, and the rich good guy was drawn to each other. I hated how the end left me hanging because I do not know what happened. The bad girl is gorgeous. It was almost like a love triangle with four, but it wasn't exactly.",1388448000,,367,3.9066666666666667
2806992,3,B000P0I4NU,"I was only drawn to this movie because of Johnathan Tucker, who appears in a lot of dark movies and TV shows about sadness and murder. Nothing about this movie stood out and I'll likely forget it within a day or two. Basically, a rich kid falls in love with a poor girl with a shady history. There's some scandal and obviously something is bound to go wrong.  Skip this.",1388102400,,370,4.285714285714286
2806993,3,B000P0I4NU,"Compelling, but lacked sufficient story depth and character depth.

Somewhat predictable. Lacked the detail needed to make it a very good or great movie watching experience.",1385683200,,173,5.653846153846154
2806994,4,B000P0I4NU,I enjoyed the plot and the acting was okay. The ending was odd. But overall it was enjoyable. Strongly recommended.,1372982400,,115,4.8
2806995,3,B000P0I4NU,"this movie kinda falls into a catagory of it's own. I like nicki reed so I went in the movie with high expectations, and I was not disappointed. it's a good movie that arrived fast.",1372723200,,181,4.2
2806996,3,B000P0I4NU,"So, I'm a local filmmaker myself and this movie was done by a friend.  He's a great writer and this is well written.  The cinematography is solid, the locations I recognize so that's fun...  Nikki Reed is a great actress but she doesn't quite shine here.  I'd say that this is an alright movie but it doesn't espouse the positive content that I think teens should dwell on.  It's kinda moody and brooding.",1369872000,3,405,4.493150684931507
2806997,4,B000P0I4NU,Very good movie. One of those must have indies. Interesting story line and I love Nikki Reed and Jonathan Tucker.,1369267200,,113,4.7
2806998,4,B000P0I4NU,Enjoyed this movie. Would recommend this to others. Share this with others. Will try to find other movies like this one and need more words. What is the point.,1367625600,,159,4.517241379310345
2806999,2,B000P0I4NU,"This movie seemed to me to be primarily a teenage angst movie crossed with a noir movie.  However, it was slow moving and I was not impressed with the angst nor the photography.  I did not find myself rooting for any character.

I am a photographer, and I would rate the photography as OK.  You can go pick up most any fashion magazine and see similar photography.  Nikki Reed is beautiful, and probably the best part of the movie.

I did not watch it to the end, so it is possible it got better, but I doubt it.",1366329600,,512,4.173469387755102

2807004,4,B000P0I4NU,"A very intimate thriller. The two main actors ""click"" (pun) so beautifully. Passion and deception both slowly unfold in this movie, increasing the anticipation of the viewer with every passing second.",1362960000,,200,5.483870967741935
2807005,1,B000P0I4NU,Never had an opportunity to watch the movie.  Time just slipped by me without getting a chance to view it,1359158400,,105,4.25
8187948,4,B000P0I4NU,"This movie moved a little slowly, but it was very interesting. I've seen Nikki Reed in Twilight so I wasn't sure how she would do. But, after watching a few of her films, including this one, she has proven herself a very talented and intelligent actress. She perfectly captured the dark, twisted, yet broken and hurting nature of her character (as she did in ""Thirteen""). Jonathan Tucker was very likable in this film as well. The overall plot was a little cliche and lacked excitement, but the performances and the overall message of the film made up for its lackluster. Worth watching for anyone who likes a dark tale of human struggle.",1436227200,,638,4.705357142857143

8187950,5,B000P0I4NU,"Up front honesty...I got this film because one of the stars is someone that I can't believe Hollywood hasn't recognized as a truly great and talented actor. JONATHAN TUCKER. Consistently wonderful in everything I have seen him in and I can probably say I have seen all his movies. (When did I become a fanboy?) yes, he was terrific in this but so was everyone else and I do mean everyone. The writer and director did something wonderful here, they created a modern day Film Noir ( I love film noir) and gave it a teen spin and by golly...it worked. The Femme fatale, Nikki reed, so good. Michael O'keefe as the cop, so good. Jonathan Tucker...outstanding. Bravo to the rest of the cast. Seeing as this is a film noir type of movie I'm not giving anything away. Look at the product description.",1416528000,,793,4.513888888888889

8187955,2,B000P0I4NU,the acting is not terrible nor is the writing or anything else.  what is terrible is watching the main actor make a complete fool out of himself by allowing himself to be duped and used by the main actress.  You would figure someone of that intellectual caliber would have some common sense but apparently not.  I could not bear to watch this movie all the way through because the main actor was a total idiot and got what was coming to him.,1404604800,,441,4.353658536585366
