8368901,3,B002FB63BC,"How did Danny the pizza boy become a presidential candidate? Was this a work of prognostication? Or was it all a dream after all?
Seriously it's a slap dash bit of 1980s social satire which amuses without much in the way of chemical assistance, but they do help.",1478304000,,262,4.479166666666667

8368906,3,B002FB63BC,"this is a low budget  "" B "" movie with bad acting, wish I had seen it on HBO, that way I would not have bought this one.",1252281600,2,120,3.2857142857142856
8368907,5,B002FB63BC,"I remember seeing this film many years ago on Comedy Central late at night and trying to figure out how it got produced.  It is really low budget and weird, but very funny in places.  Most of the jokes spin around the politics of the late 80's, so if you're under 40, you probably won't get a lot of it.  But I really enjoyed watching it again, and it's a rare chance to see a young Bill Maher in non-hosting acting role (with his shirt off for some beefcake scenes!).  He's actually quite good even if the films obviously limited budget gets in the way of some of the comedy.",1248998400,10,576,4.209090909090909
