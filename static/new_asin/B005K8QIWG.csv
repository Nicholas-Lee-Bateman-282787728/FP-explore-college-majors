8476518,2,B005K8QIWG,where is dexter today; its here but overall this doc is short on his heyday...touching at times and its obvious Dex is a complex person.  this film is not.,1350777600,,155,4.344827586206897
8476519,5,B005K8QIWG,"if you are a Flat Dou Jets fan you should just buy this now ... or if you are a fan of documentary films you should just buy this now. yup, just do it.
it is as full of full on rawk, pain, love, heart ache, redemption, searching and honesty as something can be.
the older film section is quality work as is the audio and the newer video parts that weave a tight story are also great.",1337126400,,383,3.923076923076923
8476520,4,B005K8QIWG,"I agree with a previous reviewer that there should have been more music included. I would have liked to hear Dex talk more about influences, his guitar style, his guitars, etc. To cut up the Letterman performance with talking heads is unforgiveable. It should have been allowed to play straight through. The shot selection during the majority of the interview--black background outside the motel window kind of hid Dexter, who himself is in black, was distracting. Despite these minor complaints I am grateful this was put together.",1325548800,,532,5.126436781609195
8476521,4,B005K8QIWG,"I was fortunate to see Flat Duo Jets open for The Cramps in 1990. It was like being exposed to rock'n'roll for the first time. Dex is possibly the most passionate performer I've ever seen. This guy walks the walk. And he's modestly amazing guitar player too.  Interestingly, this long awaited for DVD captures none of that. It's nearly all interview, Dex's disjointed rambling about spirit powers and dead poets. A lot of old tour videos, few of which offer any clue of Dex's and FDJ's amazing performances. I felt that this film lacked direction and lacked heart. It didn't seem that Dex was into it at all, just having to deal with a camera following him around. Jack White was in it for about fifteen seconds, and provided a better look at the FDJs in ""It Might Get Loud."" I wanted to see more of what makes Dex ""Dex."" He complains throughout the film about feeling hollow and sick with ""poisons"" and ""toxins,"" the downs lithium and neurontin from Costco sized bottles. That saddened me. If you want to know about Dex, about the Flat Duo Jets, watch ""The Road to Athens"" or ""It Might Get Loud."" This movie just left me feeling bad for Dex.

Four stars just because it is about Dex Romweber. But I'd only recommend this to ""completists"" who have to have everything about Dex. I don't know him, but I doubt this accurately portrays him.

Definitely get his new work with his sister Sara on drums: The Dex Romweber Duo. It's beautiful, and that is where Dex does honestly show himself - In his music.",1323475200,6,1500,4.527675276752768
