7276535,4,B00ZE1K2ZI,"Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone. It's a great series and Selleck doesn't disappoint me. His portrayal of Stone is spot on. A highly flawed hero, Stone is a cop with whom you'd like to have a drink. This series is much better than anything Selleck has done, in my opinion. Stone has a darker side, and reminds me of the terribly flawed heroes of film noire, not entirely moral but almost completely ethically pure. His decisions are made with that in mind. No, he doesn't mind breaking the law when necessary, but all done without expectation of reward for doing it.",1459641600,8,560,4.554455445544554
7276536,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,What can I say? It's Jesse Stone! Enough said.,1458950400,,46,4.222222222222222
7276537,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,Great seller!  Netflix removed this series and it was one of my favorites.  This seller has these movies four to a package at a great price.,1458604800,,140,4.346153846153846
7276538,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,Tom Sellecks best work to date in films not including the tv series Blue Bloods of course which is also great.,1458518400,,110,4.285714285714286
7276539,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,"Highly underrated detective series.  The Established networks don't really like these series for some reason.  I guess too conservative. Tom Selleck had to shell out his own cash to make some of them.

""The character of Jesse Stone, a deeply troubled man, was a departure for the author. Parker, comparing Stone to Spenser, the protagonist of his first series and the one for which he was best known, said, ""Jesse is a much more damaged individual who is coming to terms with himself as he goes along."" - Robert Parker

7276540,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,"I am a huge Robert B. Parker fan and having read all his Jesse Stone Novels, was concerned when the first one was about to be made into a movie, but Tom Select does an outstanding job in the role and the resultant films do not disappoint.  The DVD's arrived in a few days and  though I've seen them all, I have shown them to friends and family, while catching some details I missed when I first viewed them.  Jesse Stone is a conflicted man who possesses integrity and the drive to of his job well.  There's a part of all of us in Jesse Stone.",1458086400,12,543,4.09433962264151

7276546,4,B00ZE1K2ZI,Love Robert B. Parker's books and am really enjoying the movies.  Only one issue with these dvds-the labels on the two discs are switched around. It would also have been nice if the set of movies were in sequential order-I bought Volume 1 also but have to switch back and forth between the two volumes to watch the movies in order.

These are very satisfying movies to watch over and over.  I like the subtle way a dog is important in every movie.  Tom Selleck perfectly plays the character, Jesse Stone, who is an imperfect man in an imperfect world doing the one thing he can do very well.

7276585,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,"Recvd immediately, in good condition and by estimated date. Bought for a gift so have not viewed them. I own this series so I have seen them. You can never go wrong with Tom Selleck.  These were released out of order so you need to know the correct order when viewing them as it pertains to Jesse''s arrival in Paradise and affects some of the other characters progression.  Here is the correct order 1: Night Passage  2: Stone Cold  3: Death In Paradise  4: Sea Change  5:Thin Ice  6: No Remorse  7: Innocents Lost  8: Benefit Of The Doubt . There is also another one, Lost In Paradise, that was filmed in 2015 which totals 9. All are very good and since they were originally TV movies run about 45 minutes each.  The scenery is beautiful (Nova Scotia), the stories & characters interesting and the music haunting and well suited to the series. Hope they make more.

7276618,5,B00ZE1K2ZI,"LOVE this series. Exceptionally well done. The scenery, music and acting all lull you into a calm, focused, meditative mood.
Good character development. If you are used to fast action shows with chase scenes and non-stop gun fire you may not like these. The pace is slow and follow a direct timeline without a lot of flipping back and forth in different type periods. When you have a good story you don't have to do all that to keep your viewer interested!
Buy both sets I and II because you have to switch back and forth between discs if you want to watch them in order.
Correct order to watch these films is:
1. Stone Cold (February 20, 2005)
2. Jesse Stone: Night Passage (January 15, 2006) a prequel to Stone Cold
3. Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise (April 30, 2006)
4. Jesse Stone: Sea Change (May 22, 2007)
5. Jesse Stone: Thin Ice (March 1, 2009)
6. Jesse Stone: No Remorse (May 9, 2010)
7. Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost (May 22, 2011)

These movies are very faithful to the books that they are based on.  The soundtrack is outstanding and sets the mood in an ideal fashion.  Like other reviewers, my one criticism is the fact that the dvd's are completely out of order!!??  It is disconcerting to switch between disks, trying to follow the timeline.
