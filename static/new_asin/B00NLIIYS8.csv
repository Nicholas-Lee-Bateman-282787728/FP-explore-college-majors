8678850,4,B00NLIIYS8,I read the book before watching the movie and I was really pleased that it was faithful to the novel. The actors are what made the movie powerful and moving.,1420848000,,157,4.266666666666667
8678851,5,B00NLIIYS8,"This movie is an adaptation of ""The Devotion of Suspect X"". It adds flair and fun to a very laboriously mathematically detailed mystery crime procedural story. The physicist scholar Yukawa, in the novel, is a serious, knowledge-drive man. In the movie, he has those qualities, but also flashy, witty, handsome, and hip. Overall, I was entertained.",1420329600,,347,5.214285714285714
