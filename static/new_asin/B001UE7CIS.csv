3798125,5,B001UE7CIS,My Mother so enjoy's watching Lawrence Welk every Saturday just as she used to do years before. These bring back such wonderful memories for her. The music and dancing is very entertaining.,1356566400,,189,4.9375
3798126,4,B001UE7CIS,"I purchased this DVD for my 86 year old mother.  Not only does she enjoy watching it, so do the other residents in the assisted living facility where she resides.  It certainly brings back ""the good old days"" for all of them!  I would highly recommend this for anyone who was a big fan of Lawrence Welk's weekly TV show.",1342915200,,320,4.3
3798127,1,B001UE7CIS,"Do not waste your money the quality is so bad you can hardly see what is going on.  I bought this for our activity department and even the residents could not believe how bad it was.  I sent back the series of volume 1, 2, & 3 because we had watched volume 4.",1245715200,,259,3.8679245283018866
3798128,1,B001UE7CIS,"This will probably be the last Synergy DVD I will purchase.  The video quality is poor, and the shows are getting newer, even the color era, but presented in black and white.  The TRUE black and white shows from the 50s and early 60s were great, and the color shows ONLY had color going for them.  These color shows aren't even in color!

If some great old 50s Welk shows, especially ""Top Tunes And New Talent"", aka ""The Plymouth Show"" are released, I may buy some more.  I see Volume 4 is out with some even NEWER ""color"" shows.  I will not waste my money or time on them.  C'mon Synergy, you did a good job, especially with the Christmas shows, you can do it again, and PLEASE, NO MORE post 1965 color shows in black and white.",1243209600,4,729,4.239130434782608
3798129,5,B001UE7CIS,"I'm a 43 year old male in the entertainment biz.  I've loved Welk shows since I was a kid!!  I currently catch em on PBS weekly.  While the author involved with Alz patients is right--these shows are GREAT FAMILY FUN for EVERYONE!!  This volume has more mid to late 60s installments.  Why they are B+W I don't know?  BUT Im thankful they are coming out--I'd love some older ones too.  Nowadays--variety showshave been replaced with reality tv.  I like good clean entertainment--and these songs will be around always.  The shows feature songs from the Great American Songbook--Irving Berlin, Nat King Cole, Sinatra, these never go out of style.  The fun sets and costumes add to the meriment.  Sooooooooo lovers of welk won't be dissapointed by this third set of shows.  They are a real GEM and treat for everyone.  Even those who have no memory loss.  So grab some Geritol--if you need some energy--and sit back--although be careful too--and enjoy these shows. I love Lawrence Welk--I own every dvd on him and his show.  And I admire what he started and his great legacy.  I will even get to Branson one day for Live Welk at Xmas!!!!  Thanks for putting further dvds out on the Welk Show.",1241568000,3,1188,4.661835748792271

8343448,5,B001UE7CIS,"I enjoy listening to the Lawrence Welk band's specials.  It brought back memories of times I spent with my grandma. She loved listening to Lawrence Welk and shared her enjoyment with me.  The sound and recording of the picture isn't the best, but you can still hear the wonderful band, the great singers, and see the dances. It was fun seeing the performers having a good time.  I enjoyed all the specials and episodes of the Lawrence Welk Show.  Glad I discovered them on amazon!",1391040000,,480,4.6117647058823525
