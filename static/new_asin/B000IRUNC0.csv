8406134,5,B000IRUNC0,"I have been intrigued by the Iditarod for many years.  I can't even imagine the training, fortitude and sheer will running this race takes and I admire anyone who attempts it, let alone finishes it.  I have ready many, many books on the race and try to find ones with color pictures since I have a hard time being able to visualize what this must be like.

I bought this DVD through the Iditarod committee and my husband and I watched it over the weekend.  He isn't nearly as interested as I am, but he was willing to indulge me.  This DVD is a must for anyone who likes this particular race.  There are interviews and snippets of film with some of the more prominent mushers which provides great insight into their personalities.  Jeff King is one particular musher that I have read about and it was great seeing him speak about the race and his impression of one of the other contenders.  The photography is unbelievable -- beautiful scenes of the territory and of the teams themselves.  The animals are incredible!

While nothing, I am sure, can capture the true enormity of Alaska and this great race, the DVD does as well as anything possibly can.  After watching this, I will be viewing the 2007 and 2008 race on DVD as well.",1249948800,,1231,4.475336322869955
