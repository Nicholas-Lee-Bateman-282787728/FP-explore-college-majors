1347627,4,B00004SPFR,"The Zucker Brothers' early film that is actually pretty funny. The Kentucky Fried Movie is a pre-Airplane series of vignettes/sketches with spoofs of commercials, martial arts movies, disaster movies, new reporting, and a host of other oddball gags. The movie itself is EXTREMELY dated. Even the transfer to Amazon is incredibly grainy. Some of the sketches are hilarious. Some of them don't work so well. It is an extremely disjointed film, but it works for some reason. The movie is incredibly raunchy at times and you see the birth of the Zucker style which would go on to make Airplane and The Naked Gun movies comedy classics. This movie is more of a curiosity piece, but definitely worth watching if you are into parody movies.",1509580800,,733,4.872

1347631,5,B00004SPFR,"One of the skits in this movie was good enough to be lampooned by Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy episode ""Excellence in Broadcasting"" 35 years later.  I wish Leslie Nielsen had somehow been tied in there.  Nonetheless, a classic cult movie :)

As youngsters, we thought it was hysterical; as an adult...well, I'm not a prude but I'm not nearly as amused by such silliness. My mother, on the other hand, would be appalled. Don't get me wrong--it's still funny in parts and, if you're not easily offended [nudity, porn, ""toilet"" humor], it's a great diversion from reality...a guilty pleasure, you might say.

There is nothing tasteful or dignified about any of the sketches. But that's why they are funny!

On the Amazon Prime Instant Video there are some problems with the print quality. Most of the sketches look brand new and high def with vibrant color. But others look like they were filmed in on a 1977 8mm home movie camera, left in the sun to fade, and then were badly transferred to digital format.

1347801,5,B00004SPFR,"This movie is an uneven slapdash of comic skits. Yes, A Fistful Of Yen is the funniest and most sustained of all the skits. It's worth the price of the DVD alone and worth the 5 star rating that I'm giving the DVD. It's interesting that directors such as Quentin Tarantino and John Carpenter have also made kung-fu homage-parodies on larger budgets but have not surpassed director John Landis's modest triumph here.

Yes, there's also a lot of gratuitous nudity, though I can't imagine anybody being offended. The target in ""Catholic Girls..."" and ""Cleopatra Schwartz"" seems to be 70's exploitation flicks--which deserve as much abuse and satire as they get. If anything, some of those original flicks are unbelievably more outrageous and strangely less humorous than the parodies shown here.

You can probably turn off the movie after ""A Fistful Of Yen"" ends and not miss too much. However, if you stick around till the end you won't be disappointed either, though you'll have to sit through a tediously unfunny skit about dumb court-room TV dramas.

The widescreen version of this DVD displays very well on a widescreen-TV with minimal grain--no small feat when remastering a low-budget original. Some readers have criticized me for saying this before, but I'll say it again: no way is this DVD worth more than maybe $10. I'm seeing it listed for 40 bucks or more.

Some things hit, and the humor got laughs, and some things miss, badly.  But this is an archeological find.  It's the pre-cursor to Airplane and the entire silly genre that followed this movie.  It paved the way, so look at it like a time capsule.  This almost 40 year old movie needs to be viewed in terms of how subversive it was in the society of the time, because the shock value of what they're doing does not work on anyone seeing this movie with today's eyes.  It's very creative, it's wonderfully childishly funny at best.  Parts of it are also dated.  It's fun to see the clothing and hairstyles of the 70's, those are good dated things.

See this film, where even its ""offensive"" racial humor is tongue-in-cheek enough always, ultimately, to be saying more--such as the expression of white anxiety and Ashkenazi humor (as we should remember there being other kinds of Jewish humor).  It is one of the few films in which African Americans, Africans, Asians, whites (white Anglo Saxon and Catholics), and Jews (not all Jews, after all, are white) converge in the spirit of fun.

Others are timeless good humor (Catholic School Girls in Trouble, Danger Seekers, The Wonderful World of Sex, 11' Oclock News Part 4).

People were into big budget disaster movies, kung fu flicks, disco music, pornographic films, blaxploitation and more. This film earned its R rating. There's foul language, racial slurs, racist jokes, sexist jokes, nudity, soft core sex scenes, cartoonish violence, jokes about dead people and more. The writers also spoof TV commercials that they recorded with a Betamax Player. Bill Bixby, Donald Sutherland and George Lazenby make brief appearances in the film.

KFM took anything considered funny from ant movie and threw it in.

1348091,2,B00004SPFR,"I have no doubt this film would have been hilarious to sit through during the 70s. As it is, however, it makes me a little sad. The film is a time capsule of what it was like to be a media junkie in the 70s. At that time, TV commercials were very cheesy and easy to make fun of because EVERYBODY saw them. Nobody had cable, network TV reigned. Now you're lucky if your neighbor happened to see the same program the night before as you did. The same thing with the spoofs of TV shows - nobody makes shows like these anymore, with all their dramatic music and ""guest stars,"" etc. Everything is either a reality show or made to look like a movie. All these things are gone now. Also, the sex - pre-AIDS, you got a sense of how everybody went overboard during the 70s in freewheeling sex. Fun to watch. However, all the spoofs about TV News pale in comparison to the Onion News Network or the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In that area, the film shows how far we've come. Everything else is dated (Fistful of Yen is boring - a spoof of a genre that was laughable to begin with isn't saying much). My favorite is ""Feel a Rama"". That alone is worth the price of admission because gimmicks like this are timeless (i.e. see the madness about 3D).

Watching it again recently what I had forgotten was how funny it is. The makers were clearly influenced a little by some of the early Woody Allen films like 'Take the Money and Run'. This film also points the way for Airplane and the Naked Gun etc.

The film consists of a series of spoof adverts and parodies of specific film genres. The centerpiece of which is ""A Fistful of Yen"", which is a marvellous comedy version of ""Enter the Dragon"".

Although as Amazon point out it has dated a little, I thought for a film made 32 years ago much of it was still relevant and crucially still very funny.

That will give you your money's worth in crude laughs.  This one has the T & A, but not the humor.  I found the sketches often way too long and short on anything approaching hilarity as some reviewers would have you believe.  The Bruce Lee spoof was ridiculously long, the rest, short of all the T & A, largely forgetable.  This movie was inane.  And that's too much praise even. It may have started a genre, but fortunately that genre was largely improved upon in following years. And even then, to say it started a genre is not completely accurate.  The Monty Python crew were doing ridiculous (and hilarious) sketches in their Flying Circus (1969) long before this kind of thing even took hold in the not-so-prime time players of Saturday Night Live when that first aired in 1975.  According to the bios on the extras portion of this DVD though, the Zucker brothers had been doing a theater version of the Kentucky Fried movie since 1969, so who knows - maybe this kind of thing was just 'in the air' on either side of the Atlantic.  John Landis, who directed The Kentucky Fried Movie, did much better things than this in Animal House, The Blues Brothers, An American Werewolf in London (great!), Trading Places, Spies Like Us and Coming to America.  The Zucker Brothers, who wrote the script, also produced Airplane and Ruthless People (and the Naked Gun and Top Secret). OK, OK, watch it for history's sake, but don't expect hilarity.

This movie is full of them.  While it is not a dirty movie per se, it is rated ""R"" and clearly not something you want your 9-year-old to see.  There is some nudity that makes fun of pornography.

An important consideration is the age of the movie:  If this were 1977, I'd give it the full five stars.  Much of the satire is based on the TV commercials, politics, styles and social trends of the day.  Anyone young enough to not remember them would have some trouble getting the full impact of the jokes.  As a result, I gave it only four stars because of their irrelevance to today.

There seems to be no theme but in fact the film is about having fun with what you've got, the message of Fistful of Yen.  Don't necessarily think the brothers are much cooler and having a better time than you.  Don't be a dare devil,  you can have fun watching the news, don't wish for danger and disaster or you might get Armageddon.  Don't expect cheap thrills at the movie theater because you are single and the staff at the theater are indifferent to you,  enjoy what you can with what you have now because more bang for your ticket might be less- even if the cops don't raid the joint.  Live in the moment like the Hare Krisnas.  If you break the law you won't be like Cleopatra Swartz and you might be bored in court.  Realize that the people on the news are like us and when things go wrong on TV it's making lemonade out of lemons- focus on the unusual spontaneity of life.  And if you really feel like your life is no fun you can always visit a milk factory or get your teeth fixed.  Keep your fly zipped and just think where you'd be if you didn't have zinc oxide.

As long as you're okay with that, be prepared for a wild ride! I've never seen any other movie that does so deftly combines slapstick physical comedy (like the usher in the cinema skit) with fairly sophisticated dry humor (the parody of talk shows and Jacque Cousteau), social parody (""AM Today"" and the intermittent news flashes), and fairly explicit sexual humor.

In addition to regular skits, there are also a number of spoof movie previews, like ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"" and ""That's Armageddon!"", that make the movie worth seeing all by itself.

My only complaint is that the Fistful Of Yen/ Enter The Dragon parody could have been way shorter as it was a movie within a movie.  I actually became very sleepy the first time I watched that scene, but I was able to snap myself out of it and enjoy the rest of the film.

I had the original pressing of this DVD(which went bad but replaced by Anchor Bay free of charge), and like Airplane!, I found that it gradually grew on me after repeated viewings and catching all those puns that I had missed before.

Yes, the material is somewhat dated by today's standards, and admittedly this is one of those comedies that you either ""get"" or you don't.

Made in 1977 on an ultra shoestring budget, the Kentucky Fried Movie is a mish-mash of sketches, commercial parodies, fake movie trailers, and fake news reports that are all intertwined.  There's plenty of unforgettable moments of hilarity throughout, including the trailers for ""Cleopatra Shwartz"" and the infamous ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"", as well as the inspired courtroom sketch and a movie viewer's experience with ""feel-o-vision"".  The standout however is the lengthy parody of the Bruce Lee classic Enter the Dragon entitled ""Fistful of Yen"" which pulls no punches and must be seen to be believed.  The closing skit, in which a couple begin to have some fun on the couch while the news is on the TV, is a standout as well.  One time James Bond George Lazenby and Incredible Hulk star, the late Bill Bixby, also make appearances, and they keep their faces surprisingly straight in their scenes.  All in all, while Caddyshack may take the credit for being the godfather of slob comedies, no one can deny that the Kentucky Fried Movie set the stage for all the raunchy sex comedies and skits to be made in the last 25 years, and with the DVD being this cheap, there's no reason not to pick it up.",1148947200,,1373,4.821276595744681

The team of Zucker/Abrahms(sp?), that wacky team that done brung (poor grammar is intentional here) you great films like ""Airplane"" first cut their teeth on a sketch comedy forum they called ""The Kentucky Fried Theater"".  By having the audacity to go places that Saturday Night Live and their censors could only dream about, the Brothers Zucker and Jim Abrahms were able to create raunchy, racy, and hilarious sketchy comedy.  In the late 1970's they finally made the big leap and took their `talents' the big screen with the cult hit ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"".

""...Movie"" is a somewhat uneven compilation of sketch comedy that is crafted in the Monty Python mold.  Don't let the uneven aspect deter you, though.  When ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" hits its targets, it makes for some of the funniest and most titillating comedy on film.  One of the raunchiest skits is a `promo' for an upcoming movie called ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"".  The shameless display of naked females, graphic (but, humorous) sex, and crude humor make this sketch one of the all-time classics.  Even people who have never seen ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"" know about this famous sketch.  There are some other fairly inspired bits in this film, including another extremely raunchy skit called ""Eyewitness News (Nudes?)"" where a young couple gets quite amorous while watching the evening news.  ""Cleopatra Schwartz"" which pairs a Hassidic rabbi with a Pam Grier-type as a crime fighting couple seems just plain wrong, but is just plain funny.  Other skits like the `Feel-O-Rama' movie theater and `Big Jim Slade's love record' are quite funny.

However, the true crown jewel of this movie is an inspired spoof of the old Bruce Lee movies called ""Fistful of Yen"".  By far the longest sketch, it also packs the most comedic punch per square inch.  The Bruce Lee type character must break into an evil criminal mastermind's palace and rescue a damsel in distress.  This mastermind has a secret weapon, a prosthetic arm that looks like it was made by Snap-On Tools.  Nothing is spared in this set.  Shots are taken ridiculously sexual names that are given to Asian characters in these movies; the easy duping of an `expert' bodyguard is spoofed; and, even Detroit is spared no punches.  For me, the most hilarious aspect is the criminal mastermind's palace `alarm system'.  When you see it, you will know what I mean.  This one sketch, alone, makes the movie worthwhile.  The shameless amount of raunchiness doesn't hurt, either.  If you're curious about how the deranged minds that created ""Airplane"" got their start, or just enjoy a good film that seems to have been the inspiration for every sex comedy to come along since, then ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"" will be time well spent.",1062720000,,2952,4.943204868154158

There are times, such as in ""A Fistfull of Yen"" where the schtick drags on too long and loses momentum, and the viewer is left simply waiting for it to end so that the next sketch can begin.  However, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments (like the blind boy in ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"") to make the movie worthwhile.

1348141,3,B00004SPFR,"THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE is a series of sketches that lampoon various venues of its day: industrial training films, television commercials, news shows, martial arts flicks, and talk shows--in fact, it is very much like the original SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.  But while being on the big screen means the film can go a lot further than SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE ever could on television, KFM doesn't have the same level of talent behind it.  When you add in the dated quality of the humor, the result is very hit or miss indeed.
The film originated when two brothers and their best friend--David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams--created a live show called ""Kentucky Fried Theatre,"" and it proved such a hit that the three took the show to Los Angeles, where they managed to interest director John Landis and producer Robert Weiss in turning the whole thing into a low-budget film.  Filmed with a no-name cast interspersed with cameos by Bill Bixby, Donald Sutherland, and Henry Gibson, KFM became the surprise hit of 1977.
Some of it holds up extremely well, most notably the ""movie trailers"" for such imaginary no-class explotation films as CATHOLIC HIGHSCHOOL GIRLS IN TROUBLE and CLEOPATRA SCHWARTZ, both of which will probably have film buffs screaming with laughter.  And then there is a sketch which has a couple making love according to directions issued by a phonograph record, an instructional film on the uses of zinc oxide, a wicked take-off on ""Point/Counterpoint,"" and a still darker take-off on television public service announcement--all of them a hoot and half.
But when the film falters, it falls with a thud.  Fans of Bruce Lee will probably appreciate the film's centerpiece more than I did, a twenty-minute take-off on martial arts films called ""A Fistful of Yen;"" I myself thought it would be more amusing if it were half as long.  The ""Feel-Around"" selection was a clever idea that never actually took off, and really much the same can be said for most of the sketches.  Some of it is a matter of datedness: what was topical in 1977 doesn't necessarily have a great deal of relevance for a contemporary viewer.  Some of it is shock-humor that doesn't shock any more because it has been done so often and so much better.  But even so, and while the film as a whole is perhaps best approached as a cultural artifact, it's still worth a look--particularly if you like such films as AIRPLANE, THE NAKED GUN, ANIMAL HOUSE, and THE BLUES BROTHERS, all of which were created by various members of the crew that originally created KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE.
As for the DVD, the film quality is as good as it gets (and you should remember it wasn't great to begin with), and it offers the option of viewing the film in either widescreen or pan-and-scan--but the bonuses that seem so intriguing are actually less interesting than you might expect.  The ""behind the scenes"" home movies and stills are actually rather dull, and as for the commentary... well, it sounds like the DVD package producers got the Zuckers, Abrahams, Landis, and Weiss together, gave them a couple of beers, and turned on the movie.  They clearly haven't seen the film in quite a long time, spend a great deal of time trying to remember the names of the actors, and generally yuk it up.  Now and then it is amusing and even informative, but on the whole it isn't greatly memorable one way or another.  On the whole, I do recommend the DVD as a curiosity--and it would be a great party film--but this isn't one that you're likely to replay a great deal.",1048896000,,3522,4.725938009787928

1348144,3,B00004SPFR,"As sketch-driven films go, 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' is not in the same class as Bunuel's 'The Phantom Of Liberty', or even Monty Python efforts like 'And Now For Something Completely Different' or 'The Meaning Of Life'.  Its subject matter - kung-fu and blaxploitation films, the emergence of porn into the mainstream, courtroom TV shows, the style of TV adverts, news or cinema trailers - are too rooted in the decade they were made, and for anyone who did not grow up with the pop culture of the 1970s, most of the jokes will be mystifying.
But that's only a part of the problem.  When the film lampooned a subject I did know a little about, such as Bruce Lee movies, they ignored what was truly interesting, such as the contrast between the tough masculinity of the genre and the balletic grace of Lee's art, and instead mocked the superficial infelicities of the genre, for instance the outre formulae of the plots and characters, the inept dubbing and relentless zooming, or the exagerrated fight sequences with their piercing feline squeaks.  The result is the film's centrepiece, 30 plodding minutes of forced humour redeemed by one hysterically funny moment when the hero, having battered his Oddjob-heavy opponent with all his fighting prowess, turns around in slo-mo only to see him get up again - his undubbed expletive of disbelief had me in tears.
It is for these brief moments, rather than any sustained comedy, that makes the film still worth watching; the only scene I laughed at throughout - where a newsreader watches from the TV screen a young couple making out, and beckoning his colleagues to look and cheer - was only funny, I think, because they reminded me of my friends.  Of course, what dates the film, its being tied to its times, is also what makes it fascinating, as a kind of satiric time capsule of its era's pop ephemera - its not always positive reaction to the increasing representation of non-whites in the media is especially interesting.
The 'scattershot' approach - throw every joke we can think of in and something's bound to be funny - is recognisably that of writers Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker; they would learn that, for this kind of style to work, it needs to be tied, no matter how loosely or ironically, to some kind of character and plot, in order to sustain comic momentum.",1021334400,,2318,4.7875
1348145,5,B00004SPFR,"I think I was one of the few people to have the pleasure of seeing a pre-screening (prior to release) of this film back in 1977 at the old Fox Theater on Lincoln Blvd in Santa Monica.  It was a very rough cut and was a surprise showing before an Andy Warhol film ""Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers."" I hear that Landis, Abrahams, and the Zuckers were there too (to measure audience reaction.).  But what was eventually released to the theaters was markedly different than what I saw at that screening. For example, the ""Eyewitness News""-like segment went on for a LOT longer ( 5 to 7 minutes vs 2 or 3 minutes now).  The pre-screening also contained quite a bit of unabashed male and female nudity while they did gymnastics on the couch.  When the film finally came out, I would say about 95% of this nudity appeared to have been cut (with just a flash of male nudity).  When shown on cable tv recently, all but a few gratuitous breast shots had been excised from this scene, all male nudity (including butt shots) were gone, and the scene was shortened quite a bit (the 5 minute build-up in the original cut is what made it even MORE hysterical -- as each watching newscaster reached their own orgasm as heavy breathing voyeurs). Now it is just a brief one-liner gag (the watchers being watched).  I don't know if any of this original scene has been restored on the DVD version, but the running time leads me to believe that it has not.  But overall, a classic and a must see - with or without the footage that was edited out prior to release in 1977.",1020384000,,1553,4.390243902439025

1348153,3,B00004SPFR,"Wildly unevenly funny spoof of movies and TV from the team of John Landis and Zucker-Abrams-Zucker, who went on to do Airplane and the Naked Gun franchises.
KFM is notable for its crass humor, celebrity cameos and several unrelated bits. Most of the bits are short and some aren't very funny anymore (Bill Bixby's Headache Clinic and Henry Gibson's United Appeal for the Dead are notable in the aspect, although it is great to see the former ""alive again""). Working better are the movie spoofs from ""Samuel L. Bronkowitz"". The classic is ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"", with its gratuitous nudity and inane jokes. ""That's Armageddon"" (with Donald Suterhland as the clumsy waiter"" )is a great parody of and would probably be better than the future movie of a similar title. ZAZ also use the Bronkowitz name in their later movies.
The centerpiece of the movie is Evan Kim in ""A Fistful of Yen"", which is part Kung Fu Movie, part adventure movie and part Wizard of Oz (this begins with Dr. Klon melting a la the Wicked Witch of the West and ends with Kim as Dorothy, complete with Auntie Em, Toto, and a very familiar figure from Klon's Mountain.) This sketch comes complete with the evil villain ( Klon, who has a number of attachments such as a hair dryer to an artifical hand), a damsel in distress (Anna) and Kim as the hero. Of course, Kim gets to use his kung fu skills to kill about 50 or 60 men. Pay attention to the end, when Kim returns to Kansas. Some of his dialgoue finds its way into the credits of a future ZAZ movie. Also used in in the future Airplane is the basketball bit, only this time it is martial arts fighters playing basketball instead of aborigines.)
Another longer form sketch is ""Courtroom"" a black and white parody of the 1950's court shows (and better than the ones on TV today). This is replete with Tony Dow and Jerry Zucker as Wally and Beaver Cleaver, a morph into ""What's My Line"", and Steven Stucker as a gay court reporter, a role he would revise twice in the Airplane films. Colin Male, who was the reporter on the old Divorce Court, appears as the reporter in this spoof. Incidentally, Male's character is named ""Steven McCrosky"", a name that ZAZ would later use in Airplane. Also used again in Airplane is the character named ""Rex Kramer"".
Paying their usual homage to sports, the two opposing attorneys in Courtroom are named ""Hornug"" and ""Taylor"".  No doubt inspired by Green Bay Packers greats Paul Hornug and Jim Taylor.
Some of the other bits include ""Eyewitness News"" where a news team watches a couple having sex, a spoof of the Today show (with Academy Award winning makeup artist Rick Baker as a gorilla) and a science film showing that zinc oxide is in everything.
ZAZ and Landis were just warming up for their future endeavors and while KFM is very uneven, it gives us a glimpse of the genius that was yet to come.",1004918400,,2872,4.576699029126214

Still, even if you don't get most of it, the movie is pretty funny. I had been looking for this movie for months and finally found it at a video store out of town.
The opening skit for the Ameco (?) turning grease and other things into fuel was pretty funny, as was the Catholic School Girls In Trouble..., the rip of Bruce Lee movies, ... and finally, the courtroom scene was really funny.
Like I say, I was too young to know where many of those commercials came from, but even if you don't know and just watch the skits, they really hammered on many different shows.

1348163,4,B00004SPFR,"In 1972, David and Jerry Zucker along with their old friend Jim Abrahams (Airplane, Naked Gun, Etc.)moved from Madison Wisconsin to Los Angeles.  They had actually made a few dollars in Madison performing some  skits and improvisations out of the back of a bookstore for appreciative mostly college aged audiences.  Once in Los Angeles they rented a former half-way house on Pico Blvd (in L.A.).  They lived upstairs and worked downstairs.  The building was first known simply as the White House.  Word spread that there were some crazy people doing crazy comedy shows on Pico Blvd. at the White House.  There were soon ads running in local newspapers  THE NOSE is running Thursday through Sunday at The Kentucky Fried Theater on Pico.
The ZAZ team also earned money by producing and directing training and education films.  They made some for the L.A.P.D.'s (Police Department) Parker center and some on fork lift safety. People like Pat Proft (writer of Police Academy, Mr. Magoo, High School High, etc), and  John Landis, (who had made a low budget film in San Francisco called Schlock), soon joined the ZAZ team.
They had decided to try and get a movie financed.  They wrote a script and proceeded to get turned down by every studio in town.  Then they started with meeting with potential investors, successful Realtors and dentists. This was not successful but it did give them the idea to pool money together, borrow some from their parents and shoot part of the film,( four sketches were made-- Scott Free, and Zinc Oxide among them).  Armed with the filmed sketches ZAZ and Landis were able to get get a budget and distribution deal for their movie.
Kentucky Fried Movie is a series of crude and usually raunchy sketches which parody commercials, exploitation, blaxploitation, and kung fu movies, News programs, T.V. Courtroom reality shows, and educational films.
The pace of the film and the jokes are much slower than the Airplane and Naked Gun films.  The film is dated and the small budget they worked with means parts of the film look like it was shot for public access television.  A lot of the humor is sexist, racist, crude, rude, dumb and sophomoric and only about half the jokes ever worked. There's also quite a bit of nudity in the film.
If you're like me and find long, well done parodies of Enter the Dragon funny (even if the jokes are pretty obvious and a bit stale), you are going to enjoy yourself.  If long coming attraction parodies for  films with titles like Catholic School Girls in Trouble and  Cleopatra Schwartz (in which a Pam Grier like Amazon black woman teams with a Hasidic Rabbi to fight criminals) sound funny to you-you'll have a great time with Kentucky Fried Movie.  The news-cast sequences have been done much better, and go on for way too long, (ending with Rick Baker in a great looking monkey seat destroying the news set).  The satire of courtroom reality shows is still funny as just about every court-room cliche is acted out with terrible puns while Tony Dow as Wally and Jerry Zucker as the Beaver, observe. The satire of 70's era disaster films called ""That's Armageddon"" (featuring a quick glance of Donald Sutherland) is even funnier if you get the joke about George Lazenby.  Bill Bixby shows up quickly giving us a tour of a headache research center. There's a satire of the film gimmick Sensurround, rendered in a bit that was part of their stage show called Feel-around. Some of the cleverest bits in the film include the commercial for the Kennedy conspiracy theory board game Scott Free and the very funny educational film satire called Zinc Oxide and You.  Outside of Scott Free, the film stays away from political humor. While some of these exact same topics were parodied in  1974's Groove Tube, Kentucky Fried Movie is still pretty funny.  And surprisingly (especially for the era it was made in), there is  no drug humor in the film.
Kentucky Fried Movie is sometimes credited with inspiring or having influence on  Saturday Night Live.  Kentucky Fried Movie is also sometimes credited  for pioneering the grab bag format of satirizing  commercial, coming attractions, t.v. shows and movies.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Saturday Night Live began in 1976.  This film was released in 1977 and though e four sketches of it were filmed in 1976, few had seen them..  Besides... the cast of SNL came out of one of the most popular and most successful examples of improv comedy theater: Second City.  Both the original Chicago and Toronto groups were where the majority of the SNL cast came from.  Lorraine Newman was from the Los Angeles improv group The Groundlings which is where talent like Pee Wee Herman, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz and Elvira also began their careers.  Toronto's Second City also gave birth to the excellent long running SCTV television show which began (I believe) in approximately 1977 (John Candy, Harold Ramis, Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis etc are from here).
The first successful, widely distributed film that featured raunchy humor, parodies of t.v. shows and commercials was Ken Shapiro's 1974 cult comedy hit The Groove Tube (1974).  It was certainly this film and perhaps Neal Isreal's  Tunnelvision (1976), which gave ZAZ the idea to create their own.  The success of Kentucky Fried Movie catapulted the careers of Landis and ZAZ.  Landis got Animal House and ZAZ eventually would release 1980's Airplane.
The recently released DVD features ZAZ, Landis and producer Robert K. Weiss on the commentary track.  Unfortunately its one of the lamest commentary tracks I've ever heard.  All five of them are in a room together, and groan and laugh at various parts of the film, share some inside jokes and tell us very little about the making of the film. It's hard to tell who's talking and often they all try to talk at the same time.  There is however some interesting 8 m.m. home movies that the Zucker's took on the set of the movie as it was being made which is part of the DVD disc.  These were sent to the parents to prove they were really making a movie in Hollywood!.  They show people working pretty hard to create the zaniness which would become the film.
What's most important however is that for a lot of us,  Kentucky Fried Movie remains pretty darn funny.

While amazingly not technical the commentary  track is somewhat of a disappointment. History of the movie and more  importantly the Kentucky Fried Theater is glossed over, in favor of amusing  anecdotes.

During the interminable ""Fistful of Yen""  segment, one of them says ""Can we go home now?"" and they make no  bones about how they feel.  It's a great companion track to the movie  itself which, of course, is a mixed bag of raunchy skits....some very  hilarious and some just kind of flat.

Landis is also on target when he mentions that the film would get an NC-17  if it was released today...the ratings in the 70's were so much more  lenient.  Final question....was that shot of the ruby slippers  in Fistful  of Yen ""stolen"" from ""Wizard of Oz""?  It's  mentioned in the commentary and then quickly hushed up by one of the other  speakers.  Don't let MGM know!",963705600,,1092,4.612565445026178

1348172,4,B00004SPFR,"First things first -- this movie is not as funny as you remember it being.  How could it be?  Virtually all of us who have seen it have distinct memories not just of the zany spoofs (""Fistful of Yen"" and  ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"" being two of the most  famous) contained in the actual movie, but also of the act of watching it  -- late night before a final exam, late night after your parents went to  bed, late night pizza and beer with your buddies.  You get the picture.
I  watched it by myself recently, and though I laughed right out loud many  times, I kept looking around for the buddies that used to laugh right out  loud with me (or the equally hilarious reactions of friends who didn't get  the humor).
I guess it's my own fault.  So my advice to you is to invite  over old friends, new friends, and friends who are difficult to offend, for  a midnight show of ""Kentucky Fried Movie.""  Whether they shake  their heads in disgust, roll their eyes at the lack of taste, smile weakly  at jokes they don't get, or laugh until they cry, it's a movie that  deserves a full house.  And hey, if they don't like it, call in Big Jim  Slade.  Or better yet, send them to Detroit.",963273600,,1193,4.260089686098655

1348178,5,B00004SPFR,"That happens to be a line from the film, ""Kentucky Fried Movie"".  Tasteless, huh?  Yeah, well, so is the film.  But it also happens to be one of the funniest films of the '70s.  And also one of the most forgotten.
The film itself is a collection of skits similiar to those of early  ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Not Necessarily The News"" .  But, thankfully, there are no pesky TV censors to hold back any of the  vulgarity.  Some of the stars that are included in these unbelievably nasty  sketches are Donald Sutherland (JFK, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Bill  Bixby (""The Incredible Hulk"") and Tony Dow (The Beav!).  Also,  the film has many very funny moments.  Some of my favorites: ""Fistful  of Yen"", which is a cross between old Bruce Lee movies and ""The  Wizard Of Oz"" and ""High Adventure"" with explorer Claude  Lamont!
The film was directed by John Landis, who went on to direct  ""Trading Places"", ""Coming To America"" and ""Spies  Like Us.""  The film also includes David and Jerry Zucker and Jim  Abrahams (""ZAZ"").  They went on to do such classic spoof  comedies, such as ""Airplane!"", ""The Naked Gun"", and  ""Hot Shots!""
If you are a fan of any of these other titles  I've mentioned in this review and are not easily offended, then  ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" is for you!

1348179,4,B00004SPFR,"This midnight movie staple is a great example of (dirty) skit comedy.  Another in the great line of quotable movies, there are some skits that are extraoridinarily funny.  The ""Fist Full of Yen"" is so good you  will find that you will want to build a Martial Arts Army of Extra-Ordinary  Magnitude.
Some of the humor is not for everybody, as it is very  sexually explicit.  There is a great deal of nudity, so it is definitely  not appropriate for the kiddies.  But if you find early Saturday Night Live  or Monty Python funny, you will definitely get a kick out of this picture.  You will certainly never see the Evening News the same again.  There are  parts of this movie that do not hold up to time and some of the humor falls  flat, but most of the skits are timeless and the slow parts are few and far  between.  Plus, the 70's wardrobe and music are funny, in and of itself.
People from Big Jim Slade the former tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs  to all the Catholic High School Girls in Trouble recommend this movie, and  so do I.  It is very funny.",956793600,,1059,4.289340101522843

7921846,1,B00004SPFR,"Movie 2 of 1977 and 43 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

When I was a teen, around 14, there was a rental place called ""Red Giraffe."" They had a cult section where I saw many covers to unique films such as ""Caligula"" and David Lynch's ""Hotel Room."" ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"" was also displayed but I only got to see ""Hotel Room."" Having lived in Kentucky my whole life I have always been curious about this movie. Well that curiosity has ended and has been replaced with annoyance. This was a seemingly failed prototype of ""Airplane"" a movie series and genre of comedy I quite enjoy as do many of my generation. The reality is that most of the jokes in ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" land with a thud. Some are notablly out dated but most are just juvenile and stupid. Unlike ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" series this movie's jokes don't have the advantage of the deadpan context of those said films. I think if I saw it as a fourteen year old I would have loved it. A hint that even the movie's producers knew it was not good is the light pornographic elements. I found these scenes not to be ""risky"" or ""edgy"" but in poor taste. It's similar to the comedian that has to cuss because they aren't creative enough to come up with good material. I will say if you like this movie ""Shout Factory!"" did a superb job with the Blu-ray.

-there were three jokes that got a big laugh out of me
Cons
