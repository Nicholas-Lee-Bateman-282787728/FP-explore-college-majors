7916082,5,B00002RAOL,"For Your Height Only is a great, incredibly entertaining movie!

If you like...
- the 70's
- nonsensical plotlines
- small people kicking ass
... this movie is for you.

Truly a fan of Weng Weng! Bought this after stumbling upon The Impossible Kid (which I also love), and it did not disappoint. Although beware! The English versions of each use different voice actors, so if you've seen one, but not the other, be prepared to be slightly confused!",1404691200,,448,4.658227848101266
7916083,5,B00002RAOL,"Funny how with all the massive film budgets, hyped-up actors and film concepts these days, it has to be a film like For Y'ur Height Only that truly warms my heart.

Sure the acting is hammy, the plot is non-existent and even the action is absurd. But its all done with such keen enthusiasm and seriousness that at the very least you can't help yourself but love it.

What really takes this film to another level is the incredible dubbing. Maybe the dubbing team simply decided to let rip on this item. The 40s gangster impressions, the posh lady accents, the inane dialogue its all priceless.

All the incompetence here adds up to a one of the funniest and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.",1281571200,,704,4.484375
7916084,4,B00002RAOL,"A reviewer on the Internet Movie Database once referred to this very odd 70's Filipino spy genre spoof(?) as ""the greatest movie ever.""  While there is some scant evidence to the contrary, I confess I made a similar declaration to my bad movie buddie Jack while watching this.  It brought on one of those serious giggle fits, those breathless, guilty-pleasure, I-can't-believe-I'm-watching-this highs that only truly good bad movies can induce.  Star Weng Wang is a god, though I could have done without seeing his oddly giant nipples.  Somebody really needs to dig up more gems like this and get 'em on DVD!",1120780800,5,608,4.931372549019608
7916085,4,B00002RAOL,"This was another film introduced to me by my friend Ian, a true connossieur of bad cinema.  The main character is a dwarf who is a master spy, and a chick-magnet to the ladies.  Definitely an original idea.  Very funny, though how much of it was intentional I'm not sure.

It's dubbed too (everything's funnier when it's dubbed).

If you like bad movies, you MUST see this one.",1120780800,4,377,4.485294117647059
7916086,5,B00002RAOL,"Attention fans! the sequel to For Y'ur Height Only is now available on DVD. The Impossible Kid (aka 007 : NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE aka The Incredible Kung Fu Kid aka The Impossible Kid of Kung Fu aka 007: Rien N'est Impossible) follows Agent 00 on more adventures. Good news is that the print is a little better (not much) than the For Y'ur Height Only DVD and is dubbed (previous copies of this movie were only available in French without subtitles). Unfortunately, it is NOT dubbed by the geniuses that dubbed the 1st film but don't complain its more Weng Weng action! It is available on the ""Martial Arts 50 Movie Mega Pack"" which was just released a few months ago. I'm not going to give any plot details away but if you enjoyed the 1st film and want more midget action you might as well grab the second one.",1116374400,8,809,4.4
7916087,5,B00002RAOL,"I mean, come on, a filipino midget weapons expert spy?!?! Weng Wang is simply incredivle! I expected some good schlock but I was unprepared for the level of greatness that For Your Height Only was about to hit me with. This is hall of fame, people. Just the fact that half the villains are dubbed in by bad Edward G Robinson impersonators should be reason enough to check this out!! And I say impersonators in the plural form, but that's assuming there is more than one guy doing the voices--and that's almost doubtful . Every scene produces great line after line that you could potentially bust out at your next party and sound like a comic genius. Make a great drinking game out this movie and put one back whenever a villain gets mamed by a Weng-kick to the groin.
Sometimes it is the case with cheese classics that you need to wade through a bunch of boring parts to get to the juice. But not this one. I could honestly say this puppy moves. At one point, my buddy bursted out, ""Oh, I never want this movie to end!!"" And true indeed, it will be receiving many more viewings from this proud FYHO owner. There's even a Web site out there dedicated to the very existence of this film, which should be testament to the level of genius we are talking about. And I don't throw the ""G"" word around too much. It's just a shame Weng didn't milk this franchise and do a dozen sequels. It's so worthy. I love that little guy!
Include this flick in an evening's double feature with Willy Wonka and you've got yourself a little person party extravaganza. Put it on, soak it in, yuck it up...",1049068800,13,1582,4.384353741496598
7916088,3,B00002RAOL,"This is one of those movies that is so unintentionally bad that it is a must for any B-movie collector.  Horrible acting, a ridiculous story, the worst dubbing ever and pure cheese make this the most entertaining film to ever come out of the Philippines.  I would not compare this to Austin Powers like the other reviewers did.  Rather I would say this is the result of an untalented group of people trying to parody the Bond films with a 2 foot midget in a banana republic with no budget.  The fact that this film is even on DVD is amazing.  The price for a single copy of this DVD is probably more than they spent on the entire movie in the first place.  Support bad art and get your copy today.",1013385600,6,697,4.242424242424242
7916089,5,B00002RAOL,"Wow! God bless the moment when i bought that VHS. Weng Weng is great in this film, he looks like Jackie Chan doing ""real action scenes"", great figther, seductive, and very funny! A real good spy-secret  agents-comedy film with a lot of great moments and the most unexpected  villain!  And yes, if you like Austin Powers world you must see this one,  it's like an ancestor! Myke Meyers ought to lookig for this man to next  Austin Powers film, it would be wonderful. 88 min. of funny scenes  GUARANTEED!",964742400,3,502,4.584269662921348
7916090,5,B00002RAOL,"This is a really funny movie from the 70's. It was one in a series of movies starring Weng Weng, a Filipino midget (about 2 ft tall i think). He plays a secret agent code named Aget Double-0. This movie is filled with  sex, drama, action and international intrigue!  Better than any James Bond  movie (honest). This is a must see for an Austin Powers fan as this movie  is probably where Mini Me was adapted from. The dubbing is funny too, kinda  reminds me of Woddy Allen's ""What's Up Tiger Lilly?"".",950659200,10,500,4.391304347826087
