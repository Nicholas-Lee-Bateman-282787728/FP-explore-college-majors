8099033,3,B000CGX7FM,"I am a HUGE NASCAR fan, so the purchase was a ""no brainer"" for me. I collect all the DVD's issued by NASCAR. It is better than last years format, but it lacks a true season review. When I think of a season review format, I tend to think of segments on each race. The DVD is basically broken down into various segments of teams and then subsequently drivers. During the season I taped the ""Beyond The Wheel"" series shown weekly on SPEED, so with that I truly have a ""season review"".

All in all, if you are a NASCAR fan you will enjoy the DVD. But they won't win any new fans over with the DVD itself.",1139270400,8,600,4.084745762711864
