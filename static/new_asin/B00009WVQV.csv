1894754,4,B00009WVQV,"WHY DO PEOPLE DO COMPARISONS. Yes, this is not a masterpiece of Spanish cinema, nor was that it's intent. This was just a funny, visual and auditory romp into another world. This movie is great for open minded invididuals who want to learn more about the Latino-American and not the ""LATIN"" in general. This movie was intended for the LATINO-AMERICAN audience and for other open minded invididuals. Their were a lot of comedic nuances that only a latino-american would understand, including Walter Mercado and how he is able to wrap the latino women around his horoscope finger, the spanglish between the chicas, the ""la Llorona"" jokes, Jaci's ""blue contacts"", and the Flaming Paul Rodriguez!! The women were georgeous, and hell i though Papi was hot too. It was funny, and it actually was a positive view of latina women and the diversity in the Latino-American community. The music was great, the actors were intresting, and it did bring in some good themes and issues that the Latino-american faces in this American nation. Hell i wish there were more movies like this made that dispelled some of the myths that americans have about latinos. If you want some seriously good Spanish Cinema, there are tons of great reputable Spanish films out and that contiue to be appreciated by U.S. This movie is just for good ole fun",1064102400,2,1323,4.8584070796460175

I watched this movie and wished I would have thrown this DVD away instead. This movie was so atrocious that I wouldn't even give it to someone else to watch! There are many things in life that are terrible things to waste, time and money are two precious things you'd waste if you decide to watch this movie.

1894816,4,B00009WVQV,"The movie is a delightful romp in the tradition of the 1960's and the romantic comedies.  This is almost identical to 1,000 films where a lothario/giggolo has a skein of women pawing at him.  The difference is the Latin flavor.  If you know what 'La Tremenda' is or watch Gigantic Saturday, you will love this film.  For Anglos, it's still pretty good, but doesn't translate perfectly.
The male lead is handsome as expected; the three women pursuing him range from homely, beautiful in the full-figured realm, and finally beautiful in the Hollywood/fashion model slim mode.
Three women, competitive to a point, then colluding in putting this Romeo in his place for promising devotion and love...to three different ladies, if not many more.",1383436800,,739,5.032786885245901

1894836,4,B00009WVQV,"This movie is a cute movie with four beautiful and sexy female stars (and women assure me the male star is hot, too).  It helps that I am a super-fan of Roselyn Sanchez - one of the hottest women on the planet!  Is this movie great cinema?  No.  Is it enjoyable?  Yes.  It is one of those movies you watch, then put on your shelf.  Years later, when you have forgotten many of the scenes so that it is almost like watching it brand new again, you can enjoy it again.  That is why, when I found it here on Amazon, being sold used (like new) for $2.89 and still eligible for Amazon Prime free 2-day delivery, I went for it.  I haven't seen this movie for years (but definitely remember I enjoyed it), and when it arrives, I will enjoy it again and then put it in my collection.",1332460800,2,775,4.113333333333333
1894837,5,B00009WVQV,"Cici (Sofia Vargura), Lorena (beautiful Rosalyn Sanchez), and Patricia (Christian Tex-Mex singer Jaci Velasquez) are all in love with the drop-dead gorgeous Tomas Fuentes (Eduardo Verastigui).  The trouble is that they don't know about each other until a latino psychic guru tells them all to go after the one thing that they want.  They all end up at Tomas' home in lingerie he bought for all three of them, and the cat claws come out.  There is a beauty pageant, drug money in a car, an heiress losing her fortune for running away with her cute little pomeranian, and a pro-bono lawyer who had no idea she was beautiful or sexy until the girls need a place to stay with Tomas' overly tranquilized body.  The movie is fun, if nothing original, and I watch it every time it comes on cable.  Boasting a great soundtrack that features Christina Vidal, little sister of Lisa Vidal who plays the coolest cop on the block in this rompfest, you can't miss fun jokes on class distinction or the way three girls start out as rivals and become great friends.  So it's not rocket science.  It's enjoyable to the nth degree, and the soundtrack is to die for.  Eye candy for both sexes is what you're in for, and the idea that three women can better themselves for the mistake of being with a man who is looking for all their qualities in one woman.  It's obvious Tomas needs to keep looking and that these three girls needed him to find themselves.  Fun, witty banter and gorgeous scenery don't hurt anything either.  By the way, the Charo-resemblant Sofia Vargura can really dance, and that is just a plus in this delightful comedy!",1324080000,3,1622,4.597222222222222

1894842,3,B00009WVQV,"This movie is ok. Sofia Vergara, Jaci Velazquez and Roselyn Sanchez do a pretty good job in the performances as 3 women that realize they are all dating the same guy, Eduardo Verastegui (who knew absolutely no English before this movie started). The movie is full of inside jokes (Roselyn Sanchez' character being confused as a beauty queen when in real likfe Sanchez was a Miss Puerto Rico Petite) and spanglish worlds. The humor, very much like Hispanic sitcomes, is full of ridiculous and disparate situations. I kinda liked the movie, especially cause Eduardo Verastegui was in it.",1202774400,,585,4.979591836734694

1894844,5,B00009WVQV,"This movie is extremely funny.  It's a wonderful romantic-comedy.
It's pretty simple which makes it such a lovable movie. It involves 3 women living in different areas of the US (Miami, Chicago, and the other in New York).  The love interest of all three of these women, is Tomas, a business man who travels to each of his ladies because he can't choose just one.  All three chicas travel to Tomas' house in California.  Tomas himself is already becoming stressed out by having 3 relationships at once and is afraid of any of them meeting each other.  Well let's just say his worst nightmare (besides La Llorona getting him) comes true and he is shocked as well are the women.

That's just the beginning, the rest is hilarious with some fun action scenes.

1894859,3,B00009WVQV,"Cute movie the first time you watch it. But after one or two sittings, you'll get bored of this one. It's too sad, actually - but what can you do? Not all movies can keep you glued to the telly no matter how many times you've seen it before.",1167091200,,241,3.938775510204082
1894860,3,B00009WVQV,"CHASING PAPI has good and bad points.  It puts cartoons and music to effective use, and there's some funny satire.

Of course, as others have commented, the big plus is its beautiful ladies.  Men may enjoy discussing which of the three women Papi should have chosen.  Roselyn Sanchez is my personal favorite.

But at least for me, this film got boring.  Perhaps because there wasn't much substance to it.  When I felt I was an hour into the film, I checked the timer and saw that only 38 minutes had gone by.  The film is only about 75 minutes long (not including credits) but it felt much longer.

The jokes are tame.  Those who prefer MONTY PYTON or SOUTH PARK may not find CHASING PAPI too funny.

Worse, this film suffers from what I call ""ethnic sitcom disease.""  You know, when a producer makes a show about a previously unfilmed ethnic group.  We see a (Korean, Latino, black, etc.) family, and their home is full of ethnic posters and artwork related to that ethnicity, and the jokes and wisecraks all revolve around celebrities who share that ethnicity, as though people of that ethnic group spend all their time talking about issues related to their ethnic group.

CHASING PAPI feels like an ""official latin film,"" in that the filmmaker felt the need to pass along some messages about latinos.  For instance, Cici is constantly harping on how Patricia is ""ashamed to be a Latina"" because of her ""fake eyes"" (i.e., colored contact lens).  But this makes no sense, because Cici appears to dye her hair blond.  Sure, some latinas have blond hair, but some also have blue eyes.  What's the big deal?

For that matter, Cici's latin accent seems overdone.  I know she's latin, but she also speaks English well.  Yet in her role, she occassionally slips into a pronounced latin accent.  And because it's only occassional, it seems unnatural to her character; as an affectation done to remind the viewer that Cici is latin.

The dialogue as a whole is obvious and not too funny.  A collection of ethnic observations, feminist statements, and repetative snipes at each
other.

Even so, the film is fluffy and well-intentioned.  The women are pretty and likeable.  I was also pleased that Tomas was not villainized.  When I read the description, I worried that I was in for some feminist male-bashing, but that proved not to be the case.

It's a sometimes enjoyable film, although not edgy ""laugh out loud"" comedy.",1164844800,8,2414,4.735576923076923
1894861,4,B00009WVQV,"I bought the Walter Mercado DVD, which I have reviewed elsewhere, I also saw this DVD and figured my wife would like it.  It is a strange little movie, but entertaining.  Once again Walter Mercado, even with his brief appearance, seemed to steel the show (at least for my wife). Maria Conchita Alonso, is cute, so it is worth the $9 we paid.",1143244800,,341,4.396825396825397
1894862,3,B00009WVQV,"Look at the DVD cover. If you like the cover, you'll like the movie. This film has assembled an amazing bevy of Latina beauties that is truly mindboggling. I'm not talking about just the three women on the cover (Roselyn Sanchez, Sophia Vergara and Jaci Velasquez). That's only the beginning. Just to name a few, your television screen will be graced by the likes of; Lisa Vidal, Nicole Scherizinger and Ivette Sosa (both formly of Eden's Crush), Joy Enriquez and Sandra Ramirez (my personal favorite). How's that for a line-up and still there's more.

Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention the plot. Young, successful guy tries to juggle three girlfriends at the same time. I bet you've never heard that one before have you? On second thought, forget about the plot, just sit back and enjoy the scenery.

By the way, for all the ladies out there's also Eduardo Verastequi in the cast to peek your interest.",1136505600,2,904,4.715189873417722

It's not supposed to be a great genre-defining movie, it's just supposed to be FUN. The three leading ladies play their parts exactly the way they are meant to be played. Cici (Sofia Vergara) is the bombshell, Lorena (Roselyn Sanchez) is the strong intelligent woman, and Patricia (Jaci Velasquez) plays the rich girl. They have great chemistry on-screen and their rivalry is played very well. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: have fun, and I can't believe people are trashing it for that.",1130716800,14,601,4.788461538461538
1894864,2,B00009WVQV,"Though too fluffy and light-weight, 'Chasing Papi' is not as awful as some opinions might suggest.  Produced by none other than 20th Century Fox, one of the major Hollywood studios, it has enough budget to create the colorful looks and joyful soundtracks.  Sadly, the film just doesn't know the right way to use three surprisingly refreshing Latina-American actresses, and that's the real problem.

Well, but I think the opening chapters are awfully bumpy.  Think about this.  Thomas is dating three women at the same time; a Chicago laywer wearing glasses, a street-smart Miani cocktail waitress, and a rich, sheltered, spoiled daughter in New York.  Normally, this kind of guy cheating women, well-meaning as he thinks he is, is called Romeo, and I suppose most women would despise him, but because this Romeo, or Thomas, is so irresistible, the three women  cannot stop thinking about the possibility that SHE is the only one meant for him.  I wanna ask whoever gave the green light to this project -- are you living in the 21st century?

But to be fair, that is only the introduction, and wait a while.  The real point of the film is the ad-hoc coalition to get over the embarrassing situation (like Thomas fainting and an FBI agent watching it!), which eventually develops to the friendship between them through joining in a beauty pagent or dacing on the stage.

The film uses up its tricks pretty early on, and funny moments come very sporadically.  In fact, the characters, stories, and gags are all too familiar today, and look exactly dead art, like pie-throwing.  With short running time of 80 minutes, the film still looks padded out, and I didn't talk about the 'dream' sequences (including that of a chihuahua) that have nothing to do with the story.

As I said, the three leading ladies Roselyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara, and Jaci Velasquez do act with gusto, and they did admirable job for their characters always remain likeable.  And I like Roselyn Sanchez, who has curiously attractive charms like Sandra Bullock, and was the only good thing in terrible film 'Boat Trip.'  I just don't understand why Hollywood must keep on wasting them in this awful films again and again.

Innocuous, fluffy, but that's not the problem.  The problem is that they could think of only hackneyed ideas to fill the 80 minutes.  And they used as many as four writers.",1109808000,2,2363,4.84788029925187
1894865,4,B00009WVQV,"What's the matter with some of you people?  This was simply just a fun film to watch.  No seriously intricate story, and no offensive content.  It is truly a latina ""babefest"", and who wouldn't enjoy that?  Just like the director Linda Mendoza said:  Her intention was to make a film simular to the typical american comedies of the sixties, where everybody looks good all the time, some scene-linking animation thrown in, and some split screen scenes where two people are talking to each other (on the phone) at the same time.  I truly appreciate her intentions on how she made this film.  I hope Linda Mendoza does another film with the same chemistry.

Roselyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara, Jaci Velasquez, Lisa Vidal, and various latina unknowns make this film long-lasting, fun-filled, eye candy!

If gorgeous women and slapstick comedy doesn't interest you, then perhaps you should avoid this film.  Maybe you should stick to watching ""Star Trek"" or watching long-winded, grainy, black & white World War II documentaries or what ever else it is that you enjoy that makes you different from normal people who know how to laugh and enjoy the simple things in life.

Films like this promote ""libido awareness"", and I'm all for that!  You know, I still have a pulse. I'm not dead yet!",1101168000,2,1279,4.84331797235023
1894866,2,B00009WVQV,"A dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the US and abroad. I was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen, but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target, I think it's just a shame.

The whole cast was pretty much of Latin America origin, but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight. The plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many.",1092096000,3,535,4.515463917525773
1894867,2,B00009WVQV,"The only thing going for this Latina chick flick is the eye-candy appeal of its stars, since the plot is a ludicrous rehash of an old formula.  Charming Tomas (Eduardo Verastegui) has three girlfriends living in different American cities, who, of course, decide to surprise him all at once, only to discover the existence of the others.  Severe lawyer Lorena (Roselyn Sanchez) is gorgeous once she removes her glasses, while hot chili Cici (Sofia Vergara) understands the power of cleavage.  Add pampered rich girl Patricia (Jaci Velasquez), throw in a drug money subplot that brings in yet another beautiful woman (Lisa Vidal) as the FBI agent, and you've got the full range of this silly movie.  Its theme of female empowerment is overshadowed by lots of shrieking, running around, and ridiculous plot turns.  This is one of those movies I can't believe I actually watched.
I gave this flick an extra star simply because of the charisma the performers bring to their slender roles.  Men wanting a glimpse of these actresses in sexy garb and women looking for a silly women against the world flick won't be disappointed - as long as they aren't looking for an interesting plot.",1090022400,8,1178,4.894472361809045

1894889,4,B00009WVQV,"When my friend first gave me this movie. My first thought she has to be kiddding. But I glad I didn't let my judgement rule me. Because I would miss a great movie about empowerment,love and friendship. D.L. Hughley was hilarious. My Favorite is Lorena played by Roselyn Sanchez. But the cast was great. I would recommended this movie to anyone.",1086134400,,344,4.655737704918033
1894890,1,B00009WVQV,"This is the worst film i've seen in a long, long, long time. As i was sitting through this so called movie waitig for the credits to start, i found myself in mindnumbing agony. So i will not go in to the details of how stupid and just plain unfunny ""Chasing Papi"" actually is, because it would be just to painful (I'm not kidding).
I urge anybody who is considering to rent or even buy this ""movie"" not to do so. There are plenty of other stupit comedies out there that don't make you whant to blow your brains out.",1083628800,,515,4.16
1894891,3,B00009WVQV,"I'm glad that the Latin market is growing fast and strong and I was thilled when I heard about this movie.
So when it came out I bought it and found it interesting (you wouldn't get board with it) but I felt that it was made to be successful. I mean that because it's ""so good and funny"" that you feel that ""look for success"" vibe.
About the cast I can say that Sofia Vergara isn't just a pretty face and body, she does it very good. Jaci Velasquez shows that besides having a beautiful voice she can also act good. Roselyn Sanchez is also very good. Finally about Eduardo Versategui I think that he was chosen because of his looks because he doesn't work good at all and I think that maybe because of that he sleeps during almost the whole movie.
The story is about a guy (Verastegui) who has 3 women. One in Miami (Vergara), another in New York (Velasquez) and the other in Chicago (Sanchez). Because of his job he spends time in the 3 cities and his home in Los Angeles. Any of the girls know that they are not the only one. But one day they all decide to go to his house in Los Angeles because they heard in a Walter Mercado show (a very famous latin psychic) that women should be alert because their husbands or boyfriends could cheat on them.
So at his house the find out the whole story but they can't do something about it at that time because the love of their lifes is sleeping because he took some sleeping pills because of his stress with the three of them.
The story has a twist when a police woman starts to chase them because she thinks that they're delinquents.
The movie didn't have a lot of success but it's ok, funny and all that but not good.",1083542400,9,1662,4.213166144200627
1894892,5,B00009WVQV,"This movie has something for everyone.  It's kind of a ""girl movie,"" but the guys won't notice; they'll be too busy drooling, as the films stars three DYNAMITE Latin women!  Other people have called this film mediocre, or not so funny, but as a red blooded male, I didn't notice.  I was too busy falling in love with the female cast.",1079481600,3,333,4.426229508196721
1894893,2,B00009WVQV,"Linda Mendoza's comedy Chasing Papi is light pleasant looking fun without a lot of substance. The film is interesting because it is an entirely Latino effort. The cast as well as the production crew are all Latin.
The film follows the life of Thomas Fuentes who finds himself in love with three women in three different cities. There is CiCi the hot blooded Miami waitress who longs to be a dancer; Lorena the Chicago lawyer who reads poetry and is uncertain of her attractiveness and Patricia the New York debutante trying to break away from her family.
The plot develops when all three women show up at Thomas' home. What follows is a slapstick comedy that finds the women learning who they are and what their heritage means to them.
As an empowermrnt film the movie falls short on story. The slapstick elements take over and devices like plot are forgotten, As eye candy all three women are spectacular and large parts of the last third of the film turn into a scream and jiggle fest. But hey that not really a bad thing in this kind of film. All in all its light entertainment and worth a look .",1075852800,,1099,4.5
1894894,2,B00009WVQV,"""Chasing Papi"" is about a modern day Don Juan who winds up with more than he bargained for in the romance department.  Thomas is a young Latino hunk who has three different girlfriends in three different cities.  When his paramours finally find out about each other, a round of customary craziness ensues.
""Chasing Papi"" is an attempt to revive those old screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's, but it fails on virtually every level.  It's almost impossible to believe that it took four writers to come up with a screenplay as lame as the one we have here.  Of course one doesn't expect rocket science in a film of this type, but even in a screwball comedy a fine line needs to be established between the nonsensical and the stupid - and ""Chasing Papi"" crosses over that line with alarming regularity.  It takes a certain rhythm and style to bring off humor in this vein and director Linda Mendoza fails to provide either of those qualities in this production.  She has taken a cast of attractive, undeniably talented actors and actresses and forced them to overact so atrociously that any attempt at real humor is virtually eliminated from the very outset.  ""Chasing Papi"" relies on maniacal behavior, nonstop blithering and corny reaction shots to achieve its laughs, but the laughs don't come because the effort is so transparently forced and obvious.  In fact after about 15 minutes of watching these stereotypical shenanigans, you'll find yourself yearning for some much needed wit and subtlety.  And an occasional time out for some therapeutic silence wouldn't hurt either.
""Chasing Papi"" is certainly pretty to look at (both in its characters and its highly colorful settings), but the overall effect of the film is one of annoyance rather than enjoyment.",1072915200,2,1767,4.922558922558922
1894895,1,B00009WVQV,"Chasing Papi is another one of those embarassingly unfunny comedies that people seem to believe just the opposite.  This ""film"" contains the ridiculous ""plot"" of a no-acting talent stud of a man who is involved with 3 women at the same time.  They all find out and get mad and decide to get revenge.  The film has no visual style at all, the situations terribly unbelievable, every joke UNFUNNY, and even at its short running time it gives that uneasy feeling in your stomach that you'd rather be dead.  Don't rent this waste of time.  Please,PLEASE don't buy it.  I work at a video store and I got to see it for free, and I would've rather watched GIGLI.",1070582400,5,655,4.46218487394958
