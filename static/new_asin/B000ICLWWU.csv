8145260,2,B000ICLWWU,"The price I paid for this was not worth the amount. What made this a ""Special Edition""?",1510444800,,87,4.176470588235294
8145261,5,B000ICLWWU,As a Roman Catholic I found this DVD very helpful. During the Year of Faith it has been so often that I wanted to revive my old knowledge acquired at the university. And this very concise and fresh approach is just perfect! Keep in mind: 4 languages on one DVD!!!,1363824000,2,263,4.28
8145262,2,B000ICLWWU,The DVD does not come with a discussion guide or anything that would help navigate through the material (contrary to the picture you see which give you the impression that a discussion guide comes with it). Disappointing.,1358640000,,221,5.0
8145263,5,B000ICLWWU,"I bought this DVD to use for one of adult education class series. The program provides an excellent background on the Council, and gives a wonderful insight into the feeling of the times. I could watch this over and over and still learn at the next viewing. All Catholics should view or own the DVD.",1358294400,2,299,4.454545454545454
8145264,5,B000ICLWWU,This film provides a look at the day-to-day operation of the Council as well as insights into ways the Council shaped the life of the Church.  It's a great lead-in to reading the documents themselves.  I used it as part of a parish-based series on Vatican II and the documentary was well-received.,1351036800,,297,4.6923076923076925
8145265,5,B000ICLWWU,Pope John XXIII envisioned an ecumenical council that could assist the Church in confronting the modern world through dialogue.  When he died  in 1963 it was continued by his successor Pope Paul VI who brought the council to a successful conclusion.  The vision of Pope John XXIII and the works accomplished by Pope Paul VI were well documented in the dvd!  This is an excellent audio visual source for professors of modern church history!,1300579200,10,439,4.891891891891892
8145266,5,B000ICLWWU,I like archival film of Church events and to have this footage of the Second Vatican Council on a DVD is great! This is a documentary on the Council that improved my understanding of the Second Vatican Council. I highly recommend it!,1281916800,10,233,4.571428571428571
8145267,4,B000ICLWWU,"For teaching purposes, I have found this to be a good introduction to the excitement, social and religous context, and key ecclesial issues associated with the Council. It sets the general historical context for a more detailed examination of specific conciliar documents, and draws upon interviews with a variety of bishops, other clerics, representatives from non-Catholic denominations,and journalists who attended the sessions and the behind-the-scene processes.",1255132800,5,466,6.075757575757576
8145268,5,B000ICLWWU,"This was a short and concise view of Vatican Council II.
Excellent for teens and adult group.  This was one of my best purchases.",1195603200,13,129,4.375
8145269,2,B000ICLWWU,"Giuseppe Alberigo, who has written what is said to be the definitive history of the Council (5 volumes) seems to be at odds in his hermenutic of the Council in comparison with Benedict XVI's address to the Curia in December of 2005 where an interpretation of Vatican II as ""rupture"" was shown as false while one of ""continuity"" was highlighted and endorsed.  I hope and pray that the Holy Father (and the Holy Spirit?/!)is not being thwarted in efforts to implement the 21st ecumenical council.",1171843200,5,494,4.811764705882353
