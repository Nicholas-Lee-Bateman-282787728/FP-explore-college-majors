7955758,1,B00005V1XA,"This is a terrible movie, poor acting, poor directing, poor story development, and very horrible scenary makes a bad movie worst. Who really believes some senator is going to sit in a warehouse? Who is going to believe this guy is a CIA operative and who would believe his story so he could get out of jail?

How much money did they have to make this movie? I would guess $1200.

Poor scenenary, bizarre sequences that make no sense what so ever, poor acting, poor script development and did I meantion poor acting?

Who are the Chicks in the warehouse to begin with? Why is she posing nude when the other guys are wearing coats and you can see their breath and what do they have to with the plot? The Movie?

If someone gives you this movie throw it away instantly, don't waste this much of your life it ain't worth it.

Did the CIA lady monitoring the warehouse get killed? You really can't tell either and should I assume that idiot killed her?

Where were they located at in a van across the other street?

This is bad.",1140998400,,1023,4.352631578947369
