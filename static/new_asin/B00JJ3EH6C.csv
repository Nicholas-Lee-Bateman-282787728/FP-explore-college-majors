6359020,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"SPOILER Alert. I am not going to tell you what the story is about because everybody else's review does that and spoils it for you.

So I will just say that if you are a Tom Hardy fan, you are going to see arguably his best career performance to date. If you are not a Tom Hardy fan, this film will make you one. Originally conceived as a stage play, Steven Knight and Tom Hardy, Knight's only choice for the lead, came up with this unique way of telling a story.

Hardy drives in real time. In real traffic. On real phones. The supporting cast are holed up in a hotel room on the other end. Tom's head cold is real. He is really driving, and the teleprompter is where the visor would be. Tom said he had to watch the road traffic so there was a bit of improv going on at times. LOL  The shooting was done every night for a week, over and over, so Knight could select the best one. Cameras were attached to the vehicle to get every conceivable angle.

The technical aspects of this film will astound you.  Tom Hardy's performance will astound you. The supporting actors, all only voices on the phone line,  will astound you.  The story is bittersweet and sad and uplifting simultaneously. You will love Ivan Locke, or despise him, or judge him, or admire him. He gives you an opportunity to feel all of those.

A thundering horn-blowing Five Stars for this masterpiece of film.",1404777600,209,1376,4.34765625
6359021,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"There are few actors that are as reliable and dynamic as Tom Hardy, who most people know from his fantastic turn as Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises"" or his role in ""Inception"", but even when he isn't starring front and center he always manages to bring interesting and distinct performances to the table. And after seeing him play so many unconventional characters it's nice to get a look at him in a more every-man kind of persona, this time in the new drama ""Locke"".

With a car as its only set piece, it follows Ivan, a family man and construction manager who is in the midst of dealing with one of the biggest mistakes of his life. But while doing so, he must also orchestrate a huge challenge of his career over the phone that may determine whether he keeps his job. Desperately trying to do the right thing and attempting to keep his sanity as so many things are happening without his control, we see the series of events through his car windows, beautifully lit by streetlights and the vehicles around him.

But as simple as it may sound, it sucks you in from the start and proves to be a compelling experience with Hardy delivering a subtle and genuine performance. And if you're looking for something a bit more engaging than the standard blockbusters out now, I would urge you to give it a shot.",1404777600,8,1306,4.483193277310924
6359022,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"Whether he's the center of attention like in his furious breakthrough Bronson; under a mask and unintelligible as in The Dark Knight Rises; or part of the Inception ensemble, it's hard to take one's eyes off of Tom Hardy. More often than not it's Hardy's physical prowess that stands out; he's always had something of an animal presence about him that's undeniable. But no film has asked Hardy to keep the audiences attention quite like Steven Knight's sterling single-location thriller, Locke, and it makes the case for Hardy as one of the most compelling actors working today.

The single-location film is a tough nut for even the most veteran director, but Knight shows an uncanny confidence in only his second feature behind the camera. Known mainly for his gritty screenplays such as Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things, Knight shows his precise hand and a ton of guts in guiding a movie set entirely behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. It's a different sort of role for Hardy, as well, one that demands an exacting level of emotional control for his is the only face we're going to see, and one slip up means the whole thing could go astray.

Hardy is Ivan Locke, a top construction expert on the verge of the biggest concrete pour in Europe's history. It will make or break the company he works for, and on the eve it's to take place he hops in his BMW and skips town to London. Understandably, this freaks out his colleagues who are used to relying on the typically dependable Locke, but he's determined to get somewhere important. All we know at first is that it's to see a woman (voiced by Olivia Colman), and it must be that night. We also know that Locke has a family; a wife (Ruth Wilson) who is waiting for him at home and two boys (Tom Holland and Bill Milner) who are anxious for Dad's arrival so they can watch the big soccer match.

But Locke isn't coming home, and it's clear that this man, who seems like a good and decent person, is risking everything to fix a major screw-up. His personal and professional life is at stake through every mile of his journey, and Knight, who also penned the screenplay, ratchets up the tension or flips it around with every phone call Locke receives. It may not sound all that interesting to watch Hardy talk on his car phone for the duration, but Knight smartly doles out just enough new information that nothing stays dormant for long. What becomes obvious is that Locke is a man who has always prided himself on self-control, and a momentary lapse in judgment has shaken his sense of self.  ""I'll fix it and it'll all go back to normal"", he says with a certainty that borders on delusional. As Locke scrambles to assuage the fears of his nervous assistant, who must now handle the job alone, he must also calm down the woman he's racing towards while trying to hold his family together. The less said about the exact details the better, as Knight and Hardy guide us along deliberately through Locke's soulful journey. There are details revealed about Locke that will constantly alter our perceptions of him and the people who populate his life. His atypical actions have everyone on edge, and they bring us to the edge our seats, too.

It's rare that Locke takes us outside of the vehicle, but when he does the gorgeous, nocturnal cinematography only deepens the mood; sinking us further into Locke's plight. It's amazing how much one can learn about a man in a scant 90 minutes, but we know everything about Locke by the time the movie is done. All of his failings and strengths laid bare for us to see and judge; we know why he seems so eager to make hard decisions regardless of the personal cost. Where the story skids off the road is during Locke's imagined conversations with his deadbeat father. They seem like overkill, making a point about Locke's character that Hardy is more than capable of getting across. His performance here is understated, controlled, and he owns every single moment.

Other than a few false notes, Locke is impressively bold; as thrilling as it is resonant. If nothing else it marks daring new territory for Hardy and Knight alike.",1400976000,7,4128,4.632513661202186
6359023,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"In Steven Knight's ""Locke,"" a man's entire life unravels during one ninety-minute drive down an English motorway, via a series of Bluetooth phone conversations with several people: his assistant, his boss, his sons, his wife, and another woman. To say any more would be to give too much away. You can justly call ""Locke"" a digital-age version of ""Sorry, Wrong Number,"" except that ""Locke"" is even more claustrophobic than the earlier film. Except for an opening shot at the massive construction site where Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is a supervisor, the entire film takes place behind the wheel of Locke's BMW. Thanks to Knight, Hardy and cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, it is a dazzling experience. We learn that Locke is a man who prides himself on being a problem-solver, the one who holds things together when everyone else is panicking. And we see what happens to him when life throws him a situation that even he can't solve.

Above all, ""Locke"" is a triumph for Hardy, one of Britain's most impressive younger actors. Hardy has already won a substantial fan base through his supporting performances in such films as ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Here, he proves he can keep an audience riveted just sitting still in the driver's seat, using only his eyes and voice. We come to like Ivan Locke, for all his flaws, very much indeed, so that the fragile wand of hope that Fate holds out to him in the end feels completely earned. ""Locke"" is a must-see for adventurous filmgoers.",1400976000,8,1493,4.854901960784313
6359024,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"""Locke"" (2013 release from the UK; 85 min.) brings the highly unusual story of Ivan Locke as he is driving late in the evening from Birmingham to London. As the movie opens, without any introduction of background, we see Locke get into his BMW X5 and drive off and onto the freeway (or ""motorway"" as they call it in England). Locke immediately gets on his car phone (hands free, I might add), and pretty soon we start getting the picture. On the one hand, Locke is apparently a construction foreman (or ""master"" as they call it in England), dealing with last minute issues before concrete is being poured for a skyscraper in London. All kinds of professional and work issues arise of course. On the other hand, Locke also is dealing with a bunch of personal and relationship issues, stemming from a one-night stand/affair he had. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first of all, kudos to writer-director Steve Knight, who came up with this concept and then executed it brilliantly. But the even bigger complement must go to Tom Hardy's one man tour de force. Imagine this: Hardy is the only actor appearing on screen, and the scenery is his car and the motorway, that's it. Somehow Hardy manages to keep our interest, and then some. One could call this a ""one trick pony"" and indeed it carries the risk that the movie will be known for only that, but when you see it playing out on the screen, it simply WORKS. Hardy's acting performance is truly one for the books.

""Locke"" opened today at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening where I saw this at was quite well attended, so that is good news. If you are in the mood for a movie that truly is MILES away from your Hollywood standard fare, with an outstanding one-man performance to boot, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on DVD/Blu-ray or on Amazon Instant Video. ""Locke"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1400198400,13,2034,4.5698630136986305

6359026,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"The night before the largest project of his career, Ivan Locke, a respected Birmingham construction foreman and a loving husband with two sons, does not go home.  He instead drives nonstop to London.  He has made a complicated and profound decision:  seven months prior, in a rare ethical lapse, he slept with an older woman while traveling, and she is now delivering his child.  He will be there for the birth.  During the 90-minute drive south, he is on the phone, readying the next morning's eventsthere are machines to be tested and road closures confirmedwhile also arguing for and trying to protect the warm home life now evaporating in his abrupt absence.  The title character is the story's only physical presence (his family members and colleagues are represented by their diverse, distraught, frustrated, inquisitive voices) and invites or even demands a major performance capable of riveting the audience without fail.  The magnificent Tom Hardy is the right choice then.  With his measured, Welsh-accented voice and demonstrative face, he reveals the soul of a previously-in-control man on the verge of despair and destruction whose only option is to combat each emerging crisis with logic and a practical touch.  This is the story of a man whose iron sense of moral purpose is bruised, teased, and otherwise upended at every turn by circumstance, memory, and the volatility of the people upon whom he relies even as he hurts them, and Hardy conveys the internal ache in a way both majestic and subtle.

Also deserving of significant praise is writer and director Steven Knight, who made a fantastic directorial debut last year with Redemption (also known as Hummingbird), a dramatic action film far too few people in the United States saw.  Here, as a writer, Knight excels at crafting extended conversations which are elegant and revelatory, yet also natural in their flow and at times profane.  Where other limited-time-and-space films such as Phone Booth and Buried utilize extreme life-or-death situations to generate suspense, Knight does it through simple, but powerful human drama and a grounded portrayal of contemporary urban anxiety.  As a director, he, of course, has limited visual elements with which to populate the frame, but he finds a thousand and one ways to exploit the hypnotic and otherworldly quality of a well-lit roadway at nighta commonplace, yet alien environment of concrete and reflectionwhile also knowing when to relax his camera and train it directly and without pretense on his most spectacular instrument:  Hardy.",1399680000,93,2559,5.179611650485437

I rent very few films, like many modern viewers, and prefer my packaged streaming plans... that being said... WATCH THIS FILM! Hardy manages to keep you interested in a flick which relies heavily on a single trope (trying to keep this spoiler free) which is no small feat.

This is purely psychological.  In one car trip, you see/hear a man's life spiraling as he accepts the consequences of a relational transgression.

There is so much here, I don't know where to start, divorce, adultery, abandonment, dependency, grit, knowledge, finding what you're made of, and if people listen, really listens to Hardy'so dialogue, he or she will find something in his narrative that they can find within themselves, and that is a wonderful and awe inspiring thing, and the reason why film directors make movies, to touch us. He is a foreman at a construction site, responsible for laying concrete  (or as he effectionatly coins it, ""the block"") but ultimately he is every man. Locke is trying to grapple (in one night) the consequences of a decision that will have ramifications for the rest of his life, it will affect his wife and sons, his new child, his career and ultimately himself.

The calm and cool he manages in his voice while hes on the phone is in direct contrast to his inner struggles. On the inside he is breaking, but on the outside he still wants to make sure things are as right as they can be, given the circumstance. He makes mistakes but he owns up to them. He is not a man of excuses. He is trying. And for the most part, he is sincere.

This movie is almost more like a 1 person play than a typical contemporary film.  In that regard, it's very experimental and can be seen as a cross between an art house flick, a modern thriller, and a drama.

***Spoiler alert****. The film is about a self made man, successful, with a family and happy live who must put it all on the line in the course of a single night in order to fulfill his moral duties as a man and put right a sin from his past.  It's experimental in that almost the entirety of the film takes place inside a car, with other actors only portrayed as characters through the many cell phone calls he must make during his drive.  It may sound boring, but trust me, this film pulls it off.  The tension the viewer feels as more of the story is exposed, and the moral ambiguity that the objective viewer sees in the actions of the protagonist (hardy) stir a whirlwind of emotions and hurdle the film forward as the trip itself moves toward its ultimate end.

The defense th of the protagonist character and the ethical trap he's ensnared himself in make for the perfect antihero without being sentimental or melodramatic.  And the simplicity and scale of the settings and lack of visual effects or typical blockbuster film plot points make this film refreshing and unique in a world of superheroes and charicature violence.

If you like movies driven by story, character, and acting, you'll love this film.  Tom hardy, one of my favorite actors is brilliant as ever, and the gradual elevation of tension and exposition of the story and characters drive this movie forward like the car me hardy drives toward his final destination in the film.",1490054400,8,1774,4.550314465408805

This man has multiple life altering issues confronting him in 1-1/2 hr drive, all of which take place on the phone. Don't be put off by thst, because this movie will convince you too, to Tom Hardy's depth as an actor.  Also, if you can, be sure to look for and watch his 8-part series ""Taboo,"" in which he continues to amaze.  Taboo does have many scenes including sex, or related to sex, as well as violence, etc. So if that bothers you Taboo may not be for you, but if you can see it, it's mesmerizing.",1486598400,2,710,4.213235294117647
6359071,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"People either enjoyed it or hated, but I wouldn't call it a waste of time! Locke is about Ivan Locke, a construction director on the eve of a massive project when life interferes. He made a mistake one night, we quickly learn he had a one-night stand and got the woman pregnant, and now life is unraveling. Rather than saying to hell with the woman, he's trying to do the decent thing and be there for everyone...his wife and sons, the fling and their unborn child who are 1.5 hours away separated by London traffic, and work commitments that are high stakes. He's let everyone down, but he is trying his hardest to fix things and that makes him a relatable character, I was rooting for him and it was agony watching the night unfold as the calls keep getting worse.

 It is a one-man show, we see only Tom Hardy, which really isn't a bad thing! And he's driving and driving and driving some more - it was beautifully shot and at times claustrophobic. We've all been there when all you want is to be THERE and not trapped in a box with lights, sirens, and everything coming at you. It isn't about action and huge moments, but more about all of the little mundane things that make up life.  It focuses on Tom's acting talents, which as always are incredible, and suspense. Will his wife forgive him? Will he have a home to go home to? Will he keep his job? Will the bloody concrete get poured? Will the baby be okay?",1486512000,,1415,4.3522727272727275

Tom Hardy bares the weight of the success of Locke on his shoulders and carrys it off masterfully. The producers have assembled a stunning cast of actors who lend only their voices to this morality tale. Any one of the actors lending their voices could carry a movie themselves so it says something about the director that the cast was willing to join this project for voice over work only.
The city, street and other car lights are the second actor in Locke. I found myself captivated by the flashing, relating to the blurred light as the ride goes on in the night and wanting to rub my eyes from strain at times.

6359089,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"Ivan Locke, stellarly played by Tom Hardy, is on his way, alone in his car, traveling the long distance to make right a wrong. He is an orderly, punctilious man, who prides himself in his take-charge and problem-solving skills. And here, he tries to apply those skills to a never-ending succession of incoming calls, both personal and professional, dealing with paramount, life-altering dilemmas requiring immediate solutions, as he drives. The film is predominantly a one-man show, apart from some exceptional voiceover acting heard through the phone. It's nearly a Shakesperian soliloquy.  Hardy is amazing in this role. Brilliant also is the work of Steven Knight, writer/director. Cinematographer Harris Zambarloukos, under Knight's direction, produces a masterwork- -capturing Locke in his car on a highway at night in a dazzling display of diverse lighting, adding surprising elements of action to this tiny space. The lights and stripes on the road, light from the dash system, from other cars and from the advancing highway create a kaleidoscope of glowing patterns. The ambient sound, especially the constant jarring ring of the phone, enhances the sense of tension and frustration reflected by the protagonist and experienced by the viewer, who witnesses the grueling trials of Locke. This is a huge film, in the smallest of spaces.  Highly recommend!",1480118400,4,1361,5.384976525821596

6359111,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"There is no soliloquy here because of the verbal interaction of the character Ivan Locke with the multiple relationships he has in his life. Vast changes occur very quickly because of 1 decision he is committed to. Visually he is the only character in this film we actually see. In spite of that, the emotional and realistic situations of life entwined in these relationships become very clear. This is not a film you are going to expect because of the way it is presented. Ivan Locke gave a solid performance and if you are patient, just as you keep asking yourself if you are ever going to see another character, you will realize you are not, and that you actually do not need to. For me, that is what tipped it from 3 to 4 stars.

Yes, as Margo said the other reviews already spoil it by telling you the story. I hate that about reviews. I don't think the point of reviews is to tell the entire story - hint hint people.

For those that commented on the technical aspects of the film thank you. That information gave me more appreciation after viewing it (and I did not read any reviews before seeing it). the problem is when you watch this film without knowing all that it does become clear to me that there are going to be a lot of people that do not like this film because the average movie watcher is not looking for this type of presentation. Even I went back and forth between 3 stars,(it being okay) and 4 stars (I like it). As I already stated it earned 4 stars because the film gives you everything you need to understand the story, 1 decision and 1 consistent visual actually adds to the reality that how many things changed or were affected by that 1 decision he chose to be committed to.",1477267200,3,1702,4.349056603773585

An unlikely premise for a movie, but an interesting challenge. I would compare this to My Dinner With Andre, which has a similarly unlikely premise--two guys talking for an hour-and-a-half in a restaurant over dinner. But MDWA is a marvelous success, and Locke is a failure. The difference is that MDWA is riveting because the things the two men are discussing are big, unusual ideas that are meaningful and important to many of us. Locke fails because what Hardy is talking about are his personal problems, brought on by himself, and they are small and dreary. He's had an affair (yawn), and the woman is pregnant (yawn), and she's having a baby (yawn), and he tries to explain to his wife (yawn), and she tells him they're finished (yawn), and his two sons are worried (yawn), and so on.

This is a morality play, following the principle of James Baldwin's ""The Artist's Struggle For Integrity"": ""When it's wrong, you must not do it; when it's right, you must do it."" But I almost yearned for Ivan to be a little less than a hero, a saint. I wanted some character flaw(s) to emerge that would set us against him for even just a minute, because any great hero on a quest to become better must also have a dark side. The audience must know that what he is going through is indeed a struggle, so that the outcome is a triumph of spirit. The blame here is on Locke's  father, not himself. I hoped that before the film ended he would he would find some forgiveness so that he could be at peace himself.

To do this, he pretty much has to make choices that ruins his family and work life. What I was confused by was the magnitude of that decision. I kept wondering, if being there for the birth of his child was really that important. I still don't think it was, but the story and acting and Tom Hardy were still great.

It wasn't a perfect and unrealistic love story that seems to be the plot to every movie nowadays ... There weren't any ridiculous action scenes or unbelievable monsters chasing hot naked chics to their death. It was the jagged little pill we all have to swallow daily. An all to familiar and incredibly heavy situation that so many of us have experienced.... And on top of it, there is a ripple effect of negative events that would break any stone cold persons spirit.

Those same reviews will make this movie seem as though it were anything but a man driving in a car for 90 minutes. Unfortunately, however, this movie does not live up to the reviews that hold it in the highest of regards. It is simply a man named Ivan Locke that drives a car, making phone calls and dealing with the troubles of his decision-making skills. There is no action, no major drama, no humorous aspects, no development of the story line other than finding out why he made a certain decision. The only parts that offered any deviation from such a (I'll say it) boring plot were when things didn't go Locke's way and he screamed in frustration. Many people will watch this movie simply because it has Tom Hardy's name on the cover art, hoping for a gripping performance which he normally provides. A great number of people will be disappointed when they realize that any Joe off the street could have done the exact same thing, saving the production company millions of dollars. In my opinion, I think this movie was a complete waste of time and that it was an utter waste of talent by hiring as good an actor as Tom Hardy.",1472947200,,1222,4.509009009009009

6359159,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"First, I give the director of this film a lot of credit just for taking the stylistic risk that's involved here. We live in an extremely conservative age of filmmaking; there seem to be about a half-dozen (I'll be generous) pre-approved templates to be used, and woe betide the director who deigns not to adhere to one of them.
""Locke"" does not feature superheroes or Pixar animation.  It is not a feel-good story about a precious but socially awkward child with an adorably quirky family.  It's not a gross-out comedy, or a White hipster love story.  It's a ""small"" (i.e. no CGI stuff) film with only one character onscreen for the entirety of the movie. It wouldn't have been surprising to see this story presented as a short story or a stage play, but as a film, ""Locke"", with its unique structure, becomes a bold experiment for this era.
It could have easily gone horribly wrong with a less skilled, less compelling actor in the title role, but Tom Hardy is one of the best of his generation, and he is amazing here.  Because of him, you remain engaged throughout, you sympathize with him even after learning his truth (I won't spoil anything), and you root for good things to happen to him, even when it becomes clear that he is undeserving.  This movie could have been tedious, could have become claustrophobic, or depressing, but because of the great storytelling and especially because of Hardy, ""Locke"" is a fascinating, emotionally resonant work.",1472947200,,1456,4.761904761904762

First saw Tom Hardy in The Revenant, (I personally think HE deserved the Oscar, not Leo., but, of course that would never do.) and was so amazed by the performance I wanted to see other films he'd done.  So I watched The Drop, and then Locke.  I enjoyed both, and find that T.H. is truly a man if amazing  talent, even in mediocre films.  I was uncomfortablw with his way of tslking, his voice mannerisms, in Locke, but one reviewer said it was a Welsh inflection (?) Never heard that before, so I don't know.  He sounded very 'upper class' to me, and that didn't seem to fit the character.  Interesting premise, but I didn't enjoy the (to be  expected) sexist , degrading comments about the woman,( reassuring his wife that she was 'very old' (43?) fragile, and ugly) that he did it out of 'pity) and  the stereotypical hysterical calls from the wife, and the woman giving birth.

6359197,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"Tom Hardy won the LA Film Critics Best Actor award for his performance in this film. Why he was not nominated for the Best Actor Oscar that year is amazing. It was a very competitive year, and many fine performances were left out, but this should been one of them. This is a flawless performance. Made even more difficult because Hardy is the only person in the film. Every emotion, however subtle is covered here, and Hardy never, for one moment, appears as if he's acting, even though you know he is.  He has to keep things interesting, confined in a car, on his way to support a woman he had an affair with, who's now giving birth to his child. This all plays out as everything falls apart. He has had to tell his wife and family about the affair, so you know how that goes. Then, there's a large building project he's responsible for, and it's a very delicate project, so he's trying to deal with that, with one of his employees. I don't want to give too much away, but believe me, you want to see this film. It's never boring, even though, again, Hardy is the only person in the film. In some ways, it reminds me of the film Moon, which had another great performance built around a single actor, only there, the actor was playing himself in doubles. Tom Hardy, is by far, one of the best actors working today. It's only a matter of time before he wins an Oscar. SEE THIS FILM!!!!!",1468540800,2,1385,4.326923076923077

Tom Hardy delivers an excellent performance as a man who needs to let his life be turned upsidedown in order to stay true to himself. Through a series of phone conversations during a drive we learn all about Ivan Locke, what matters to him, what kind of man he is and why.

The crazy thing is that Locke is the only character we ever see on screen the entire film. Every other character is only heard through the phone yet the dialogue and the strength of Hardy's delivery are more than enough to keep you on the hook. Locke is a ride you don't want to miss.",1464825600,,636,4.170731707317073

6359270,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"This is a neat little film, that will certainly appeal more to film buffs than general audiences. If you're the sort who just caught the last episode of (insert television show) and you're thinking you'd like a nice little action movie with that guy from Mad Max in it, you picked the wrong film. But if you're the sort who likes to analyze filmmaking and you're always looking for something new, this is a neat little gem.

The Setup: Locke has just ended his day as the top man running the construction of a gigantic new building. Getting into his car, he begins driving and making a series of calls. As the night wears on, his calls get increasingly emotional as all of the plot is revealed through Tom Hardy's acting and the series of calls from a host of well-known actors (yes, the guy who appears on the dash as ""Bastard"" played Moriarty on Sherlock). Locke is tired, he has a cold, he's frustrated by his problems, and there's constant drama between his own bleary-eyed driving and his attempts to save his work and his home life as we learn more about this dramatic evening.

Why People Don't Get It: Yes, this entire movie is basically just Tom Hardy sitting in a car. At the end of the movie, I also felt that it was very short- probably enhanced by the slightly closed-in, racing atmosphere of the film. Overall, this seems like a ""small"" movie. It seems more like the sort of thing that was based on a short story and someone happened to land some Hollywood actors. It's wonderful, but it never really rises above ""normal"" life- which is one of the movie's central points. I'm not spoiling anything when I say the end shots of the movie imply that this man is one of many traveling that road that night, hinting that the world is filled with these sorts of stories.

So that's why this film is going to make everyone's ""Top 10"" lists for the year, while it has rather low ratings on a place like Amazon. This is a movie for film buffs, or for people who like to see ""small"" stories played out on the big screen. There are no explosions, the world isn't in danger, and the worst thing that happens in the entire movie is that some guy has maybe consumed one too many cans of alcohol Even so, smart direction an incredible acting from Hardy make this a must-see.

6359291,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"Going through the 1star reviews after watching this film, I found a whole bunch of people who are uninterested and/or bored by the premise of a man forced by circumstances of his own making to realize he doesn't have things as under control as he thought. Don't mind them. They are probably uncomfortable with the idea of true introspection and don't want to expend the effort of deeper, more analytical thinking.

I found the film to be riveting. The transformation Hardy goes through emotionally is reflected in his face as he becomes more and more haggard. He literally ""had it all"" and ends up losing it all. To see him proverbially grasping at straws as things careen further and further out of the control he thought he had was (for me) heartbreaking.

It's true that the entire film takes place with Hardy driving the car. Literally everything happens in this car. There's limited movement and interaction because of that. If you are expecting something else to happen you will probably be bored and disappointed, like the 1star reviewers. But if you can appreciate a performance showcasing a dynamic range of emotion and reaction that is intensified by being confined to one space, you will likely enjoy this film.",1461456000,2,1222,4.8701923076923075

There are no spoilers in this film but to give you some sense of this character's insufferable one-note piety I will reveal some plot elements below:

Impregnate a woman on a one-night stand? DRIVE to her side during her labor despite missing the single biggest event of your working life the next morning, endangering the careers of all your coworkers in pursuit of your puke-worthy nobility?  Mais oui, because you are a man's man.

Get fired, understandably, en route, by your boss when he learns that manly man that you are you must be there for your love child's birth? INSIST that YOU will carry through direct the next morning's landmark work by phone DESPITE being fired because THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE HALO.  Without question.

A noooobbbllleee man faces up to his one-time (drunken and lonely but  of course) mistake. That's the ENTIRE film.",1460419200,2,1094,4.818181818181818
6359305,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) experiences a thoroughly bad day (or should it be a night) at the office. Driving down to London to be with his pregnant ex-lover Bethan (Olivia Colman) at the maternity hospital, he has to tell his wife Katrina (Ruth Wilson) the truth about his sexual exploits, while dealing with a series of crises at work involving the delivery of a huge amount of cement to a building-site as preparation for the construction of another skyscraper. In the end Ivan ends up losing family and job, but at least he has become a father once more.

Shot entirely in and around Ivan's car as it speeds down the freeway, Stephen Knight's film concentrates solely on the protagonist's changing series of expressions as he talks on the phone to Bethan, Katrina, his associate Donal (Andrew Scott) and his boss Gareth (Ben Daniels). We never see the other characters, but hear their voices as they try to reason with Ivan and make him change his mind. When not on the phone, Ivan looks into his wing- mirror and exchanges imaginary conversations with his deceased father, whom Ivan blames for not fulfilling his paternal duties.

LOCKE places considerable vocal and physical demands on its leading actor. Hardy turns in an excellent characterization of a family man buffeted by circumstances, while being tormented by the memory of that one night of lunacy when he got Bethan pregnant in the first place. Despite his determination to be different from his father, he ends up making precisely the same mistakes in life - something for which Ivan knows he is totally responsible, even though he would like to believe otherwise.

Thematically speaking, Knight's film concentrates on the ways in which we try to cope with circumstances that often seem completely beyond our control. Despite his failings, we have to admire Locke for his resourcefulness, as he manages to keep the multi-million pound building project on track, even though it places almost impossible strain on Donal's physical and intellectual resources. Although Locke is not as successful in managing his family life, we understand that he has tried his best to atone for his past errors.

The film has rather a soft ending, as Locke finishes the drive down to London, but nonetheless director Knight has created an effective low-budget piece of work that dramatizes the loneliness experienced by many on nighttime driving.",1460332800,,2389,4.994974874371859

The dialogue is masterful and the supreme awkwardness is balanced out by the dignity of the main character, whom I liked in spite of myself.  Most heroism in modern films amounts to the guy strapping on guns and pummeling faces without suffering nary a bruise: I quite liked this kind of heroism, wherein the man admits his mistakes and vows to redress them regardless the humiliation, with some tears and snot in the mix.  Really, I never respected him more than when he cried listening to the sound of his son's voice.  The dialogue he continues with his deceased father adds another layer to the narrative, making an interesting commentary on contemporary masculinity.

6359380,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"I will try to keep this review brief.  Basically what happens over the course of two hours is that Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is driving somewhere, a destination at first only known to him.  While he heads there, he deals with a series of phone calls that affects what is happening to his personal and career life.  Meanwhile, he argues that he's trying to do the right thing at first to himself, then to others.  Saying more would probably spoil things.

For the most part, the concept of Hardy revealing things about Ivan and his life through a series of phone conversations works.  Hardy does a good job of expressing his emotions whether it's listening to his son describing a soccer goal or pleading with an official to bend the rules for him while the official is eating at an Indian restaurant.  The conversations with his dad while in between calls do a decent job of filling in some of the motivations, but it does distract from the film and calls attention to the fact that it's more or less a film version of a staged play.

The good news is that the conversations and the plotlines are compelling and the fact that it's almost in real time does add an urgency to the proceedings.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, but if I could give half stars, it would probably be closer to 4 1/2 stars out of 5.  So if you like good movies, make time in your schedule for Locke.",1455753600,,1368,4.329411764705882

The entire film is set inside a car and unfolds in real time as Ivan Locke, played by Hardy drives along the highway to an uncertain fate. While on this journey, Locke engages in a series of cell phone calls with family and colleagues all of whom are in conflict that we the audience will find all too familiar and painfully and interestingly identifiable. Although, Hardy is the only actor on screen, Locke is very much an ensemble piece enhanced by wonderfully talented actors who all deliver great performances over the telephone. The cinematography is amazingly beautiful and dynamic. The photography serves the story well and makes the film feel very large. This is a tour de force film that must be given a chance.

6359644,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"This is basically a performance driven piece (no pun intended) since it takes place more or less inside of a car for the entire film. The story isn't incredibly deep, nor is it terribly interesting, honestly. However, it still manages to hold everything together competently enough.

But that's really not what this movie is about. It's all about Tom Hardy, and if you like Hardy and are open to an unusual film in terms of story telling, then I'd suggest watching. The story is told entirely through phone conversations and strange monologues that Hardy has in imaginary conversations with his dead father.

Other than Hardy, the voice acting is pretty good. It could have easily come off as very hammy with lesser actors, but everyone was convincing. But Tom is the real star here and pulls off a pretty good performance. His strongest moments are his more stoic ones, whereas I think it was less successful during his more zany sections (ie his monologues) which is funny since he is well known for playing odd-ball characters such as Mad Max, Bronson, and more recently the Kray brothers. This could be due more to the script, though, since you never feel that, despite this film being extremely dialogue heavy, Locke becomes a fully realized character. The story is very linear and doesn't give much room for Locke to develop, but despite the film's shortcomings, if you've got an hour and twenty minutes and are a fan of Hardy, I would recommend this movie. If nothing else, it's a unique approach and is a fresh breath of air in an otherwise very mechanical field of film making.",1443484800,,1586,4.763636363636364

- Completely upend his life.
- Implode his loving marriage.
- Get fired from an amazing job.
- Probably get sued into poverty.
- Have a new born child with a woman he doesn't know.
- And very nearly collapses a global conglomerate.

How? Because of one lonely night seven months previous.

On that celebratory night culminating yet another successful building project - he had sex with his assistant. It wasn't love. It wasn't need. It just that, and I'm quoting here, ""She seemed lonely."" Not tempted by someone who was young and pretty, in fact he flatly states she's in her forties and quite plain. Nor was he enamored of her personality which he, again, notes was reserved at best.

She just seemed lonely.

That monstrous understatement truly doesn't convey matters at hand. That sole misstep will utterly destroy him.

Having grown up without a father, coupled with the misfortune of having been born on the wrong side of the tracks, he's spent his entire existence avoiding such lapses in judgment. Working hard, devoted to family, grounding himself against ego - Locke is admired by many. He pays particular attention to sidestep the mistakes of the worthless sperm donor who impregnated his mother.

In fact, his entire being is based a sterling reputation for exactness and precision; for constantly triple-and even quadruple-checking. Living the maxim of measuring twice and cutting once.

If he were Buddhist, he could've claimed Bodhisattva evolution.

Until that one night.

Now, seven months later, just prior to the biggest project of his career, a project that is so detail-oriented that he is literally the only man alive who can properly oversee its construction - he's leaving it all behind.

As Locke drives away from the build site and into the city - he repeatedly has to: Steady and support his terrified second-in-command, reveal his folly to an increasingly and understandably hostile wife, tries and fails to explain to his boss that he is essentially sane despite evidence to the contrary, and repeatedly calming the nerves of the woman carrying his unborn baby --- all of this in order to insure that his soon-to-be-born child will not grow up without a father.

He or she will never know a world without a loving dad.

Overall an intriguing and, often times, infuriating journey of self realization and sacrifice.

Kudos to Tom Hardy - again. The man is proved once more that he has earned the oft-cited mantle of ""Brando Of His Generation"".",1443139200,,2533,4.915492957746479

I do like Tom Hardy as an actor and I also really wanted to like the movie but honestly i don't agree with all the high reviews on rotten tomatoes. The
whole film he spends in the car which is kind of boring, so most of what we get to judge the movie on is basically phone conversations. Seems dumb to me he gets fired for what he is doing. I understand the whole moral dilemma he is going through but i think a lot more could of been done with this. lastly, we don't know the outcome of any of these scenarios that are important to him and thus important to the viewer, so for me this film fell short.",1443139200,,616,4.016260162601626
6359664,3,B00JJ3EH6C,"If you're on the look out for a slow burning drama which is completely different this might hit the mark for some viewers, but the attempt at making an entire film misfires in a few places not the fault of the cast or crew I would add.

Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke a construction manager due to oversee a huge project early in the morning. However Ivan heads off in his car and starts a long drive; during the trip we see him uncover problems with his marriage and conflicts with work and questions over his future direction in both work and his relationships/family. That is basically the story without spoiling what unfolds during the 85 minutes more is revealed during the drive piece by piece.

Bar Hardy entering his car at the start the entire film is shot in the vehicle and the supporting cast are only heard never seen this is a one man show taken to the extreme for a film production whilst this puts a lot of pressure on Hardy's performance it also uncovers some weaker elements with the story which could leave some viewers disappointed in the lack of pace or conclusion to the film. Credit has to be given to Hardy he carries his role well and is entirely believable as Ivan and he laps the role up easily if you wanted an intense actor trailer this would be ideal - but we're watching a film and there are times you feel detached from the events.

Supporting cast even though they are only heard are up to the job too Ruth Wilson plays his Wife Katrina, Olivia Colman as his former lover/one night stand and Andrew Scott puts a perky performance in as one of the men working for Ivan. Ben Daniels and Tom Holland also have supporting roles too. I can't fault any of the acting in any way all do a fine job and more than I would have expected (not having a visual cue might make it quite a hard task voice acting isn't that easy)

A nod has to go to Haris Zambarloukos the Cinematographer; what a nightmare for anyone shooting the film one man a car and that's it you have very little variation in scenes. He succeeds in holding some attention during the film some wider night shots driving, close up shots of Hardy and the control console where he's scrolling though the on-board phone numbers he keeps it as fresh as you can during the near hour and a half run.

Where the film fails for me is a few areas the storyline whilst it's quite a good one doesn't reach a satisfactory conclusion there is an event near the end but we never see him leave the car or meet anyone else. It's also unlikely to bear repeat viewings very well as you will not only know the story but the visuals as good as Haris has tried to make them offer little variations for viewers there isn't a lot of chance you'll spot something you missed first time it's dialogue heavy (though moments where Hardy is silent he does that well too) Perhaps over ambitious and trying a bit hard to be off the beaten path possibly worth a look.

After 20-30 minutes you'll know if the film is for you if not it will quickly get the off button. The story needs more work and I also think that it was a mistake to have it limited only to the car this hugely limits the scope of audience interest and it really needed some segments out of the car and some visual connection to the other actors at least a little. I blame the director/writer Steven Knight he boxed himself into a corner and didn't allow himself room to move trying to play the ""oddball"" card with a single extended scene was risky and in my view has not really worked. It has lots of potential but it will divide viewers I can't really call it a satisfying watch even though I admired the cast and performances. You can only work with what you have; here there isn't that much to work with

I'm puzzled it got such critical acclaim I'm giving this 3 purely for the acting which is excellent as a story it's a 2/3 out of 10 some viewers might love it many will hate it",1442880000,,3903,4.302040816326531

The film is professionally done (even though it's an uncinematic story). However, the premise is so flawed, it's ludicrous.

Any other semi-rational human being would have waited a few hours more--after first watching the soccer game with his family and then finishing the concrete-pouring job the following morning--before trekking to London to visit his newborn.

I had absolutely no idea what this movie about.  I thought it was some kind of ""The Driver"" type of flick, because of the thumbnail and since most of the films I've seen with Tom Hardy are more action-based. I clicked on it almost casually, as something to watch in background while I worked on a project.  I was drawn in and shattered by this movie. I'm still stunned when I remember that I just spent 90 min. watching a guy in a car.  Hardy's portrayal of a man on the precipice of emotional, creative and financial disaster is brilliant, just brilliant. As is the incredible writing by Stephen Knight. I remember when ""Good Will Hunting"" came out and people said ""every man should see it."" No. Every man should see ""Locke.""",1441411200,5,749,4.609022556390977

6359726,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"LOCKE is a tough movie to like because it makes an unusual demand on the audience.  It wants us to care about one fairly humble, ordinary man (Tom Hardy) dealing with the unraveling of his life as he makes an 80 minute car trip.  We have to be okay with the entire movie taking place in one car.  We have to be okay with the only actor we see being Hardy.  We have to be okay that all the action/dialogue takes place via bluetooth phone conversations in Hardy's car.

What is amazing to me is that I DID care a fair amount.  First of all, Hardy is amazing.  His character is a blue-collar, middle class, middle manager in England.  It's the eve of one of the biggest logistical deals he's ever had to coordinate on behalf of his employer.  He's expected home for dinner with this wife and kids.  But when he receives urgent and inconvenient and VERY unwanted news...he's compelled to hop in his car to make a drive.  He has to tell his boss and co-workers that he won't be around for the big transaction the next morning.  This is news is NOT well-received.  He has to tell his wife a terrible secret.  He has to talk to his sons without really telling them anything.  And there's another person (the reason for his drive) that he needs to continuously reassure and distract.

His problems are really pretty mundane in the world of movies.  The country isn't in danger.  His family isn't in  physical danger.  The stakes are small for us as movie-goers but HUGE for Hardy.  We have to care about this intense but flawed every-man.

With Hardy once again being so astonishing, we're set up to be interested in this man.  But as it becomes clear this movie really is as mundane as it seems, the script and editing are what power us through and at the end, make us feel that we've seen something greater than the sum of its parts.  We've found the ability to care about a small moral dilemma and the stubborn, righteous decisions that are made as though we were watching grappling with huge, lofty issues.  It's a pretty cool juggling act.

It was tempting to give the movie 5 stars, because it does accomplish so much of what it sets out to do.  But even I couldn't always clear all the hurdles I mentioned above.  Sometimes it was just a bit too stretched out to make the movie (barely) full-length. I felt some good points were made, and then the filmmakers had to make them again and again, just to pad the time.  It's not a terrible flaw, but it was noticeable.

But it's still a must-see if you appreciate good acting.  Watching Hardy take command of this challenge and wrestling it to the ground with ease is very much worthwhile.  And watch the short making-of video afterwards.  It's very interesting to see the method used to make this film.",1441152000,2,2748,4.442885771543086

I find it interesting in that it is a very mundane but relatable subject matter that is somehow made intriguing. I guess it's just nice to view something that is more based in reality and doesn't have to sweep you away.

This movie fails where so many do; at the ending however as I mentioned above I suppose this is because it is a 'life-like' story. There is no resolutions provided or anything that you really can take away at the end but I suppose that is the way life can be. It is sort of disappointing that the ending just kind of occurs leaving the viewer with an unsatisfied feeling. I suppose this is better than throwing in some inappropriate twist or unexpected outcome just to say the ending is successful.",1441065600,,892,4.341317365269461

6359796,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"I don't often write reviews, but occasionally I find myself astonished and in need of expression. This film brilliantly explores less taken paths in filmography and acting. First, however, I must advise those who only want light-hearted entertainment or are interested in this only due to an assumption that a film starring Tom Hardy will be overflowing with action, this film probably won't be your cup of tea. I still recommend stretching beyond your comfort zone for your own sake, but understand that not everyone wants the same moviegoing experience. This is more of an experiment in storytelling and is the greater for it. So, if you are interested in a study on the art of acting in all its depth of expression and emotion capturing and projecting every nuance of the human experience, then please sit down for an hour and a half and enjoy.
I watched this film mainly because I have recently been impressed with Tom Hardy's performances, but braced myself to the possibility of boredom based on some of the reviews. Wrong. I was riveted and tuned in to every line delivered by a phenomenal cast headed by the powerful and charismatic Hardy. Although you don't see the other cast members, their presence is strongly felt. Very well done. The focus, however is on Hardy. In my opinion this is his best performance to date. He doesn't overdo it. He's right on the spot down to the slightest facial twitch. It was one of those movies that left me staring at the screen all through the credits (and saying ""of course!"" inwardly as I saw the names of Ruth Wilson, Olivia Colman and Andrew Scott roll by). I was left in a muddle of empathy and desperation for Locke and those around him. That, in my admittedly laymen's opinion is good storytelling. That is the point of all art. To evoke feeling. Reaction.
So, to those willing to risk less than two hours of their lives on something outside the box, I say it's worth the reward.",1438992000,2,1930,4.6627565982404695

He's making a nearly two hour journey between two UK cities; so you experience his conversations and drive in real-time.

I do give the writers credit, there are just enough teasers to keep you watching, hoping your time investment pays off in the end...but it doesn't.

The rest of movie is him driving his car and talking on his cell phone to different people in an attempt to resolve all three issues.

It's difficult enough to create an illusion that can take one out of their ""reality"" when you have a team of visible actors to support you but Hardy does this extremely well in this creative and powerful drama. The tension is palpable and only increases as the plot moves forward. Hardy maintains the center of action and focus within a cramped space of his car and his self-imposed honor. He is mesmerizing with his ability to create an almost visceral world of tenacious integrity yet at the same time treading a thin line of insanity, or at the very least irrationality at its extreme, or so it appears. And that is the heart of this film, the questions of honor, doing the right thing, integrity and ultimately being true to one self no matter what.",1433808000,,829,4.608108108108108

6359945,3,B00JJ3EH6C,"Locke is set entirely inside a BMW for the entire film, it does drag in parts and ultimately since it is just a car ride along a motorway that leads to London. We never find out what the outcome is for any of the events put in motion or that we the viewer become aware of by phone calls during the drive. Instead of the film just ending with him still on route, maybe a few scenes of him driving on later days taking phone calls or listening to the news on the radio, even in a different less expensive car to portray if life went downhill after the drive, perhaps he's a driving a taxi or something to pay the bills.  We're really just left hanging, which is disappointing as the journey there became tedious and boring, as you kept waiting for something to happen that never did.

You can't fault the acting by Tom Hardy, the only person we ever see.  You can fault the writing though, really crashing the car or something might have been nice, I mean he was on a busy motorway, using a phone the whole time and having very stressful conversations on it, even reading a file to someone on the other end at one stage.  Perhaps being pulled over by a passing police car or something, well anything really.  Plus it didn't really make sense why he needed to abandon his life and get to London that night.  He didn't know the mother other than for the few minutes he slept with her, so it's not like she emotionally relies on him to be there, she'd have her own life friends or even the hospital staff would do a better job than a stranger.  Sure he needs to do the right thing by the kid and be a part of its life but he could have broke the news to his own family in person (which would be a bit classier than a phone call), gone to work and finished the expensive project and then gone to see his new kid the next day, perhaps taking his new baby's siblings with him.",1433376000,,1868,4.1722222222222225

A man, a car, major problems.  That said, it is a tour-de-force of film acting, directing, lighting, and most of all, writing.",1432857600,,443,4.395061728395062

6359992,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"Locke is an almost oddly compelling and emotionally engaging movie. The premise would be gimmicky in less worthy hands, but with Steven Knight's direction and Tom Hardy's remarkable performance, it's a beautiful and affecting movie. The self-imposed constraints of shooting in real time (stopping only to reload the camera, from what I've read) in a car driving down a highway gives it all a somewhat claustrophobic tension and and a realness that a more conventional movie may have lacked. I watched because I'm a Hardy fan, but knew little about the movie, other than the fact it was just him in a car. I knew nothing about the plot or details beyond that. It was fascinating watching it unfold, watching a character--a life really--develop with each conversation and each reaction to the situation. I'd say it's best to NOT read all the reviews telling so much of the story. I loved watching the story and the character unfold with no prior expectations.

Hardy is strikingly handsome, but he's also a shape shifter and can appear to be very different people in different roles. His Ivan Locke as an ordinary, hard-working man--with a head cold, no less--who is almost primly self-contained and controlled is miles away from the criminals, rogue spies, or super-villains you may have seen him play. Here the handsome face becomes rather ordinary and average. You become so caught up in Ivan Locke's character and situation that the actor disappears altogether. The moral dilemma, the struggle to do what he believes to be right, create all the drama and tension you need to keep watching. I was engrossed enough that the time flew by and the movie actually felt shorter to me than it is. By the time the ride was over I was deeply engaged in Ivan Locke's life and was moved more than I would have ever expected to be by a movie that's essentially a series of phone conversations in a car. Any fans of Knight or Hardy or simply of the art of movie making will be well rewarded by watching. Locke is a remarkable achievement.

As an aside that I find kind of amusing, I saw Mad Max: Fury Road earlier the same week that I watched Locke. Hardy's performances in the two roles are kind of the extreme opposite ends of the spectrum, with all his other roles falling somewhere in between. Going from the barely verbal, almost feral, all-action all-the-time Max to this guy stuck in a car seat doing nothing but talking made for some crazy contrast. Any doubts that Hardy is one of the finest actors working today should be laid to rest. If I wanted to convince someone of that, I'd say start with watching Locke.",1432425600,4,2609,4.6943231441048034

You really believe the character Ivan Locke is a real person.
Fantastic. Makes one wonder about truly great actors who just aren't known due to the fact they never appear in anything that really pushes their skills. Hardy could easily star in a series a very forgettable action films (like that thing he was in with Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine) but he won't settle. I hope he keeps up doing films like this.

Not that you have to be an uppity critical-type to enjoy it or something like that, the subject matter is human enough that even a casual observer could find some enjoyment if they stuck through the opening 30 minutes, but a connoisseur is simply going to find more to savor.

As for Tom Hardy, he is, simply put, as good as Anthony Hopkins at his craft. His capacity to deliver a particular word in a particular way, to emphasize it and taste it and to strike just the right chord with it are almost unparalleled right now. His ability to communicate mood and command the center of the screen are captivating. He wasn't just right for this film, he's good enough to be right for every film in which he's cast.

This is ""Divorce, BMW Style"". A rolling monologue that buries a formerly blissful marriage under a vanilla tryst and  a zillion tons of concrete. Yes, concrete.
The message seems to be that one should throw your family and career ""under the bus"" in order to be a ""stand up guy"".

Lots of views of a BMW dashboard.

Driving forward to the birth of a baby with a woman who is virtually unknown and unloved so he can ""be there"" at an event the child will never remember.
I would suspect far worse has been going on in his life which the movie stupidly does not reveal.
Or he has suffered ginormous brain damage in the last few hours. Lightning, aneurism, meteor strike, whatever.
The guy part of my brain soon was hoping he would drift into oncoming traffic. A gas tanker maybe! Stupendous explosions, cars flipping, bodies flying. Asunder.
No such luck.
I'm sure somewhere this is regarded as an acting triumph for Tom Hardy. Probably, but I kept hitting myself with a rubber mallet for relief so it's hard to say.

What this movie IS, is a Poem. A poem that is wonderfully written and paced. Every single time Locke answers his phone or misses a call his life turns from bad to worse and still manages to stay the course. Some might consider the ending to be lacking, but again, that is if you are watching this movie as a movie, if you watch this movie as a poem, the ending is perfect.",1429747200,3,545,4.102803738317757

This is an actor I had to look up on IMDb and find out about.  His acting range is incredible.  In this film, Tom Hardy places a man who is determined to ""do the right thing.""  It all takes place inside the car he is driving in.  This could have been an unbelievably boring film, if not for the amazing acting and incredible writing.  I was fascinated and could not look away.  If you love great film this is a must.  I'm not altogether sure this is a movie for hardcore fans of blockbuster super fast action movies.  If you need to have things blowing up constantly or loads of characters to keep you interested, then you may not like this film.  In a world of movies where it is now hard to go a week without a new super hero release, this was a breath of fresh air. Very low budget and since I mentioned super heroes, the character in this movie is as BIG as Superman.  Everyone could learn a thing or two from Mr Locke. Great movie - one of the best I've seen lately. I watched Bronson before I had seen this and could not believe this was the same actor! Truly amazing talent.

The entire movie takes place in Locke's car while he's driving to London, making and taking phone call after call. And through these phone calls (hands-free), you hear his life falling apart (or at least totally changing).  He stoically believes that he can maintain control, but control is an illusion. He's on the road to be with the woman who is having his baby after a casual one-night-stand. But this comes at the expense of his marriage and his job. He's reassigning all priorities in his life, and it's fascinating to hear his life go off the rails while he stays on the road. And you're trying to figure out why he's making the choices that he's making, given the consequences.

This all takes place with one actor in a car, and several voices at the other end of the phone calls, but it strangely held our attention, even with no flying bullets, things blowing up or spactacular CGI effects. Thanks for a nice change of pace.",1428710400,,1040,4.586021505376344

There are several things happening at one time in this movie.  There is Donal, who is going crazy at the cement plant trying to get everything ready for the big ""pour"" the next day.  There is Tom's wife and sons, who are dealing with Tom going to London and why.  His boss, the owner of the plant, of which Locke is the head man, dealing with him not planning to be there the next day.  His London emergency, which is why he has to leave.  And finally, a dialog with his father, who apparently did not take responsibility for some of his actions.  Each of these things that are happening place vivid images in your mind of the scenes playing out, yet the whole movie takes place with Ivan Locke, in his car, driving to London, talking on his phone.

In the movie, which feels at times like a stage play (which is a good thing, as dialogs are good), main character abandons everything in order to attempt to prove that he is not like his father.  Locke has a will and strength but his actions are not of sane individual.  He is not only sacrificing work but also all his relations all the people around him.  Movie tries to explain his single mildness as ""pouring the foundations"", a single most important task when done incorrectly causes serious cracks in the future.  In  the light of all the damage he leaves behind one has to wonder about his sanity.

I think it's a good character study, not only of the main character but also of all (voice) actors in the movie that leaves a lot of loose ends for you to ponder.  It's a great movie to see if you like stage plays, and movie to avoid if you like happy endings, special effects, where everything is either white or black.",1427846400,,1146,4.220183486238532

Framing device of the car and a single person on screen is an interesting one. It does feel indeed like you are a silent passenger. It would have probably even been better if the camera angle supported that for the most of the journey. However, if you were in that car, you would have probably smack the drivers ears at least once, and would have felt completely ignored. And that is what you feel like, ignored and ultimately unimportant. There are deep issues to be pondered here, but there is no excuse in putting them into a form of a podcast with a camera. It gets a pass for a rather interesting setting and great performance. Without that performance it would have fallen apart in mile one.",1427587200,,826,4.513333333333334

6360249,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"Considering that this movie is essentially 85 minutes of Tom Hardy talking, by turns, on the phone and to himself, it is remarkably engaging and even suspenseful at times.  Of course, anyone who has seen Hardy act before probably won't be surprised by this.  In the beginning, it's a little difficult to tell exactly what's going on and who these people he's talking to are, but all is revealed shortly and, in my opinion, that gradual revelation is most of the fun.  As we come to understand what Mr. Locke's predicament is and the type of person he considers himself to be, we actually begin to feel his anxiety and desperation along with him.  He sees himself as a man of principles who puts ""doing the right thing"" above all else.  Unfortunately, in the situation in which he finds himself, it's hard to determine exactly what the ""right thing"" is--all the options he has to choose from are bad ones.  As a result, his grip on his morality, and thus his identity, becomes more and more tenuous as the film progresses.  His strict sense of morality even becomes a bit aggravating at times, but it's somewhat easy to get past that, in part because we're given a backstory that explains rather convincingly why he is the way he is and how he's able to justify the choices he makes.  Movie nitpickers might say his ""conversations"" with himself are a weak device for delivering this backstory, but we come to understand that these conversations aren't so much with himself as with a ""ghost"" from his past.  And, again because it's Tom Hardy and he could captivate an audience by reading a telephone book, it's easy to forgive.  The ending was a bit disappointing, but I suppose it leaves a lot open to viewer interpretation.  Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth watching.",1426896000,,1773,4.687096774193549

Tom Hardy delivers in this story of self redemption amidst an atypical failure as a man in both his roles as a husband and father.  He needs to be the lead more often.

This is a character study. Basically, if you like reading short stories, this is a good movie for you. This isn't a novel with a bunch of action and loose ends. This is a tight, well-made story with a solid ending. Artistically, this is near perfect. Mood wise, this is good for a quiet night in, you and maybe one or two other people, or just you.

His character, Ivan Locke, embarks on a journey alone in his car that will change his life forever.  Ivan has made a very big mistake which has come to a head the night this movie takes place.  His mistake results in his life being shaken to its very foundation, just like the building he is supposed to be constructing.  Everything about this movie is full of symbolism.  The claustrophobic nature of his car, the faceless people on the other end of the phone, the occupation he has as a concrete expert, and the nature of his lonely journey.  It is a movie that will make you squirm as you see everything about this man's life start to crumble and fall.  It was uncomfortable to watch.",1424822400,,788,4.3493150684931505

The movie consists entirely of a series of phone conversations he has enroute to his destination. And it's one of the best and most engaging character studies in recent cinema. Locke is trying to do the right thing in an enormously difficult situation which grows ever more complex. If you are deeply interested in people and what makes them tick, and in what constitutes the best, most moral behavioral path when no clear one presents itself, you are likely to find this riveting, and one of the best 10 or 15 movies of a very strong film year. (If that sounds uninteresting, of course, then by all means pass on it; thank goodness, there is no law that says that every extraordinary movie must appeal to all viewers).

If you like off-center, quality writing, story line and a tight, emotional, gripping gut wrenching empathetic connection with a single, solo, actor - and you're ok with not liking everything you see but loving the fact that you are a voyer looking in - this may be for you. If you don't like simple or you are expecting CGI or action packed whatever, move on, this is not your kind of movie, this is a movie lovers kind of movie, different and endearing - not at all a happy ending, but totally original and, to me, worth the watch if you are ok with having a lot of moral dilemma and unfinished ethical questions remaining.

What I'm saying is, the entire film takes place Locke is driving and fielding phone calls from family, friends, colleagues and angry members of management.

Do yourself a favor and watch it anyway.

Really, it's worth it, even if you're not a particular fan of Tom Hardy's previous work. With Locke he manages with the help of an excellent supporting cast (that yes, never appear on screen) to paint a portrait of a man that doesn't flinch from responsibilities or screw ups to a point that most of us would consider masochistic but can't help but admire and (at times) maybe even pity.

What would Locke be with a little white, or gray, or maybe even shiny black lies? Another man entirely that's what.",1424044800,,879,4.515723270440252
6360515,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"Bought it, watched it. Twice. First time through was not as good as the second time through. This is an idiosyncrasy of mine--I read all night to find out what happened in fiction. So I don't do fiction much.

In any case, the second time through, was so enjoyable--acting was excellent, dialogue was great. Inspiring to me just for the model of someone who is holding it together and figuring out the next move. Very male in sensibility...I like the practicality of the character. Was not too enamored of the scenes talking to his father, though it certainly added some understanding of his particular response to life.

So it leaves one with the question of what is next for this character. I think it will be ok; I think the wife will calm down eventually; the son whose call Locke just listens to and does not pick up... has learned his father's problem solving, and the generations for this family Locke are on the upswing in terms of figuring out how to move ahead in non-ideal circumstances. I do think so.

Honestly, it made me understand an isolated episode of infidelity. Pretty damn big mistake, but no new life is a mistake. And that is the great mystery and the great renewal of the world. I have ended up loving this film. But it takes some quiet work...and I think I will be thinking on it a long time.  I feel less depressed after seeing this movie:  it leaves me with the sense that resilience is possible, even in my own life.  I do wish I had a father like him.

The direction gives a nicely romantic experience with Ivan Locke and his long journey to see his newly born adulterous child with an estranged one night stand. The film has Ivan Locke driving in its entirety while he converses with his job, his family, and his mistress. I found myself not being able to turn away from this film until he started hallucinating that his father was in the backseat; which no actor was placed in the film it was just Locke talking to the backseat.  I also lost interest once I realized there would never be another scene outside the interior of the car. Nothing is ever shown beyond the car. No scenes of his family in their home, no scenes of his boss and co-worker in their offices, no scenes of his mistress in the hospital, every actor was just voiced over Ivan Lockes car phone. The movie quickly become repetitive and uninteresting as the same conversations and dialogue would return in a cyclic interval.

He is too smart to think he can keep things as they were, but is hoping that his inherent dignity and care will survive intact. It is a tale of simmering intensity which put me under its spell.

The entirety of the film is set in the first scene- Locke driving, answering calls for his mistake, and looking to find the next logical step forward.  Things develop steadily phone call after next,and the audience is never left long to dwell (as so often we are when alone and driving) on our protagonist's position.

#1. As the trailer indicates, the entire movie is dialogue based and takes place in Locke's car.
#2. The movie focuses on the themes of adversity, morality, and emotional abandonment.
#3. Is much more subtle and understated than Hardy's other films in the US (Warrior, The Drop).

 If you consider the above three points and still want to watch it, I'm sure you will like it! The movie offers intelligent dialogue, great acting, and a well-written story.

And then, by three minutes in, I was hooked. Yes, the entire film takes place in a car. And yes, the most action in the film is the unending series of phone calls. But in the space of 80 minutes or so, you have just watched a solid, dependable family man's life disintegrate because of one single uncharacteristic mistake. In those 80 minutes or so, Ivan Locke runs the gamut of human experience and emotion-- pain, anger, humor, compassion, and a desperate attempt to keep what remains of his world together. Tom Hardy is absolutely brilliant in this film.

rooting for this man in crisis, trying so hard to do the right things as his world threatens to come crashing down.  The plot reveals itself
through dialogue, as we  never leave the car,  and I was holding my breath in the last 10 minutes.  Also riding in the car is an invisible

I expected that I'd be bored from the monotony, but I ended up wanting to watch until the end so that I could find out what happens to his character, Ivan Locke. The tension and drama of the plot, as well as Hardy's acting skills, is what made this movie work.

The bad news: It still would've been nice if the director had let Ivan Locke finally get out of the car, even if not until toward the end. Based on most of the negative reviews here on Amazon, many people who saw the film disliked the car thing, as well.",1422662400,,706,4.268656716417911

6360559,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"While concrete might not be the most lively subject for a movie, it literally keeps this film cemented together. Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke, a by-the- book, detailed-oriented, construction site manager whose life begins to unravel in the time it takes for him to drive from his construction site to the hospital where a one night stand is having his baby. Through near perfect dialogue, writer/director Stephen Knight keeps the action - which except for the opening scene takes place solely in Locke's car - moving quickly, like the speeds on the M4 highway. Locke, through the car's Bluetooth, juggles phone calls from his wife, his lover, his boss, his kids, his assiatant manger, and a few other characters thrown in there for good measure.  And when he's not talking to them, he wrestles with the spectre of his dead father admonishing him for not cleaning up his mistake's that Locke, with his own problem, is trying to rectify. Like Locke's life the highway becomes another character weaving in and out of focus thanks to some great cinematography. Hardy is terrific in title role portraying a soft spoken man struggling to hold it together while his life goes down the toilet. Great supporting cast - even if they are only heard on the phone - especially Andrew Scott (Sherlock's Moriarty) who plays Locke's assistant. This one is well worth the watch.

It helps if you know, when you start watching this film, that none of the action is actually shown. It sounds like a weird conceit for a movie - it would have worked as a radio play - but I think it succeeds brilliantly. Watching Locke figure out that the guy he's talking with is drinking cider tells you something about Locke. Cutting to the can of cider would not.

You might not like this movie at all - you'll know after twenty minutes. The style is so different from the typical Hollywood product that you may have a big adjustment to make.

Trust me: put the popcorn away, break out the Pinot and stop trying to force the plot. This whole man's world is imploding, which is revealed only through the phone conversations he is having with the principle people in his life. Tom Hardy gives an amazing, subtle but taut portrayal of a man whose careful, buttoned-down life is, in the course of 90 minutes, being destroyed.

Locke has a very important project to complete the next day at work, but he jumps in his car to be with the woman who he's seen only one time, but is having his baby.  This is not compassion and sensitivity, it's selfishness.

 It's not realistic, but ok, let's go with it.  He drives all night handling phone calls from his wife, whom he just admitted the infidelity this night on the phone.  Yeah that's right, he never did tell her about it and on the eve he's driving to the woman having his baby, that's when he tells her...and on the phone.  Everyone on the project at work is freaking out because he's a key component to getting it done right, but he's on the way to be with the woman he's only seen once, have his baby.

The movie presents Locke as a man who is willing to throw it all away to ""do the right thing"".  But the real reason he's doing it is out of an unhealthy resentment for his father, whom he screams at in the car, as if his ghost is listening.  His father apparently walked out on him or something.  The bottom line is he's not thinking right.  He's has his priorities backwards because he's using this act of driving to this woman to rub in his dead father's face in it.  ""Look at me dad, I don't walk away from my life's mistakes.""  --No, the guy actually is walking away from his family and....well, everyone with whom he's had loving relationships and to whom he has obligations.

6360629,3,B00JJ3EH6C,"LOCKE (2013) Starring Tom Hardy
---------------------------------------

The entirety of this 85-minute film takes place inside the protagonist's vehicle as he makes a real-time journey on the M5 to London from his home in the north. It is not immediately clear why this man, Ivan Locke, is driving to London on the eve of the biggest day of his professional career. Locke is a respected construction project manager who specializes in pouring concrete foundations for gigantic skyscrapers. It's a complex and delicate business, and Locke is the go-to guy who manages all the logistics. On the night before the biggest pour in European history, when it is absolutely crucial that he be at the job site to oversee all the moving parts, he's gone AWOL from his life, walked away from his job responsibilities, and his family, without a word of explanation to anyone. What he's up to, and the reasons for his increasingly fraught journey are slowly revealed through a series of phone conversations Locke has with various people in his life as he's driving. It's impossible to discuss what those are without revealing spoilers, though many reviews already have done so. Tom Hardy's performance here generated a lot of buzz, which compelled me to see it. I will say that the trailer is a triumph of marketing, and the 'pulse-pounding thriller' that's enticingly dangled in front of us as we imagine various scenarios our hero is running from turn out to be far more prosaic than anything we've imagined. Locke is a man with a predicament that is all too commonplace; what is not commonplace is how he chooses to handle it. Is he a saint? A martyr? Or just in the grips of a wildly self-destructive impulse? Because in the 85 minutes it takes for Locke to get to his destination, he dismantles his heretofore successful life with every passing mile as a result of this impetuous impulse to self-sacrifice. I think viewers may be sharply divided as to the wisdom of his actions. He takes an extreme black-and-white approach to his dilemma, when a less drastic middle ground may have been found that allowed for less collateral damage.

Similarities to ""Phone Booth"" come immediately to mind. Though Locke is on the move in his world, for the viewer, the interior of the car is a static, closed universe very like a phone booth. Without the wonders of Bluetooth technology, this movie would not have been possible; it's a 'Mobile Phone Booth' for the 21st century. Tom Hardy has to carry this entire story with just minute facial expressions and vocal inflections, since his physicality is limited and his only interactions with other actors are non-visual ones. Very few actors could sustain this level of intensity for what is essentially one 85-minute take--a one-man play taking place in real time inside a car. After a while, when the purpose for Locke's flight has become clear, the 'set' became stiflingly claustrophobic, and I longed for Locke to roll down his window so I too could get some air.

Tom sounds very different here than we are accustomed to hearing him; he has made a conscious decision to speak with a Welsh accent. I wish I could ask a bona fide Welshman like Ioan Gryfudd or Sir Anthony Hopkins how Tom did with that. For those unaccustomed to the Welsh inflections, they can seem quite odd. I found this feature of Tom's performance a distraction, and not an insignificant one, since all we've got is 85 minutes of Tom speaking in what is for him a funny voice. He felt that this accent was an integral shorthand to his character, though from my point of view, he would have been equally or more, effective with his natural voice.

In the final analysis, ""Locke"" is a somewhat frustrating viewing experience that delivers less than is promised by the marketing. Not a thriller so much as a dysfunctional domestic drama with a cast of one. It might be very helpful in the context of couples' counseling, though, as our hero's ethical dilemma is faced by scores of people every single day. Perhaps that's why, when all is said and done, I felt that ""Locke"" lacked enough heft to be called a feature film. I call it a filmed experiment that leaves the viewer unsatisfied. There is no final resolution to Locke's problems, no sense that he has actually moved toward a future he wants, merely away from a past which he has discarded unequivocally, and he is most likely going to regret that heartily in the days to come. But for us there are no days to come--it just ends.

3 stars for Tom Hardy's conviction. Minus a half-star for the Welsh accent.  The voice actors deserve praise as well, for bringing their individual characters to life vividly through only the medium of their voices.  Andrew Scott and Olivia Colman are particularly memorable.  But ultimately the script is too thin to sustain the kind of searing, thrilling drama the director was going for.",1420675200,,4877,4.7907253269916765

It's not for those who are action addicts, but if you're here to listen to a story, this is one of the best ways to see it told.

This film is more than the story itself, I've seen some reviewers list it as a guy who does this and that (trying not to spoil anything here) and end their review with ""THAT'S IT."" But this film is much more than just that, it's a man's struggle to learn the lines of responsibility and it left me wondering what really is the ""right"" thing in any situation.

This is story-telling at its finest. The entire film takes place on an English Freeway with Ivan Locke behind the wheel. It is told in real time with no breaks which made the story very real and gave me a strong sense of the character's desperation and urgency.
The film is a series of mobile phone calls between Ivan and various characters, all whom add a new perspective on the story being told. The story unfolds gradually. This kind of story-telling is enthralling in that it does not rely on special effects, crazy unbelievable characters, violent shoot-em-up scenes. It relied on listening to each character to gain perspective into his or her life and to see how it impacted the main character, Ivan.
Tom Hardy, the only person that you ever see during the film, was fantastic. His performance was ever so subtle, which seemed just right since the camera was only inches from his face during his entire performance. This is an actor who we will see again.

It's about a guy who has screwed up something in his life. He is a normal guy with a wife, kids and a job. The thing he screwed up does not cause the police, the mob, the japanese ninja's to come after him. He is normal and is trying to fix a wrong he did in his life and how it affect other aspects of his normal life. It all takes place in a car and he has to call people and talk with people on the phone in order to keep things from falling apart. With his phone, he does not call the police, the mob, or the japanese ninja or use any special effect....he just converses with others on the other end of the phone.

This movie is not the kind of film to watch if you want CGI effects, explosive action, clever dialogue banter, or weirdly twisting plots.  It is also not the sort of story that those who have experienced little of life would usually appreciate.  That being said, it is straightforward, deceptive in it's simple beauty, and truly a charcter study that is one of the finest I've seen in a long time.  Considering the brevity of the running time, it's an amazing gem of a movie altogether.

This is the story of one man's life, and that of several other characters, all affected and turned upside in a single night.  When I was watching this, I caught myself thinking it would be the kind of movie that would have undoubtedly made Rod Serling smile.  I think that Tom Hardy is amazing in his performance, and especially in how he is able to interact with and react to charcters we cannot even see, something I seriously doubt all the ""haters"" here have any concept of just how difficult that is for an actor to pull off well.

So if this kind of theatre style ""vignette"" is not your cup of tea, please just move on and don't watch - no need to just spew out hate on a movie for the sake of hating ANY movie that doesn't have the all the formulaic elements you think it should.

The other characters are not pictured, only heard, leaving Hardy to carry the movie in a one man show type format.;  Hardy does what he can with this one man approach, but for me, the viewer, it grew tiring and overlong.

Or at least a pick a booger. Or maybe a nice raspy fart and quickly roll down the window scene.. as all the drama is happening.  That's what happens when you're stuck in a car driving and talking.  You're in the same place all the time in this movie.  But Tom Hardy is famous by the way.  I learned that after watching this movie.  He is famous evidently.  So shut up and don't say otherwise.  The guy is famous and gets paid money to act, which you don't.  Watch the DVD extras and here the old man that wrote and directed this thing talk.

To be able to tell a complete and very real story with the entire ""action"" taking place in the front seat of a car, a daring premise that totally pays off. I am guessing that people expected an action ""movie"" instead of the fabulous film this is. You definitely need to pay it attention and watch it like a film as opposed to something to put on in the background while doing other things. But it is worth it. Also, it is short, the length was almost perfect. I think they could have trimmed out one or two phone calls and made it tighter, but still. Never have conversations about football been so poignant.

6360832,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"A tour de force delivered in the improbable context of a single individual driving his BMW luxury car into London while phantasmagorical out-of-focus images of night-time traffic lights play across the windshield.  What is going on inside the vehicle is certainly not unfocused.  The movie plays out in the substance of more than a score of telephone conversations occurring within this confined space.  And what is this substance other than a profound insight into the wellsprings of human morality.

The portrait of the protagonist shows us a man who has achieved success by anyone's measure.  He is a middle-aged man who has gained the respect of all those who know him, including his wife, his children, his bosses, and those who work under his guidance in his position as a construction foreman requiring the very pinnacle of skill and integrity.  We are to learn he is a man who will not compromise - except once, of course.  It is the price that he has decided he must pay for this compromise that requires he sacrifice everything he values in his life simply to give an unwanted child a name.  His motivations for doing so are discovered in a series of monologues delivered to his hated father who now lays moldering in his grave.

It is the exigent demands of tomorrow's historically largest concrete pour for the foundations of his skyscraper and those attending the birth of his unwanted child that forms the dilemma of this parable of morality and demands his (and our) riveted attention throughout his night time ride into London.  The metaphorical linkages are unmistakable.

There is a lesson here for those who read reviews.  Our crumbling society is reflected the the opinions of those for whom such moral dilemmas simply do not exist and not a single car crash or gunshot occurs in this one-actor movie to placate such a dearth of ""action"" for such viewers.  This is why the average star-ratings are similarly meaningless.",1419984000,,1940,4.878048780487805

It shows that despite our achievements at work, in hobbies and what we have created for ourselves, the deepest impact was made by our parents; the deepest wounds come from our parents and drives us -- can make or break us.

Though his character didn't speak much, I liked how Hardy played the character with such depth of feeling that I could feel his portrayal of the character's emotional highs and lows in the pit of my stomach. I next watched him in the movie ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and found myself eager to see more of him in an expanded role. Then along came ""Locke.""

I must say that I passed by this movie many times during my search to watch something simply because the cover didn't pull me in. But, one evening when nothing was of interest to me on either Netflix or Amazon, I decided to give this movie a try. I was absolutely enthralled. It takes real skill to tell an entire story complete with a full range of emotions while confined in a single venue - in this case a car traveling on a highway at night.

His tears felt real, his drive for excellence and perfection in his work was authentic and informed his choice to do the right thing.

Let me explain and say that i did find Hardys acting to be very good at hooking you and reeling you into a movie that was lacking in every category but the acting. If you want a movie that does more than keep you hooked, this is not for you. There was no pay off for me. Felt like i had been suckered into watching it thanks to Hardys ability to play the viewer.

However, the story is so compelling and the obstacles thrown at Mr. Locke as his auto trip proceeds are compelling, as is his character.  The viewer comes to care very much for the characters and the outcome of the story.  Review readers can find a synopsis of the storyline at Amazon.

6361048,1,B00JJ3EH6C,"On the one hand, this movie kept my attention enough that I didn't turn it off after his big secret was revealed.  On the other hand, though, I had it playing in the background and that was only curiosity rather than intrigue.

Yes, you can play it in the background because the entire movie takes place in his car as he's driving steadily down the M1 (a major highway in England).  Yes, you'll miss his short fits (we're talking seconds) of rage as he comes to grips with the mistakes he's made and the fact that he can't reason his way through them with the people on the other end of the phone.

I hate spoilers but I'm so disappointed and don't want anyone else to be sucked in expecting an action film and getting almost a drama.  Don't be deceived by the trailer!  There is no chase scene; the police were speeding by him while he was on the phone.  He's not under duress; he's explaining his situation to people on the phone.  And he doesn't really plan on never coming home; he's just driving to London.

Perhaps because they realized that they didn't have a truly compelling story, nothing is resolved at the end of the movie. He hasn't reached his destination. We don't know how his home life will be sorted out. We don't know what's going to happen with his job. The movie just ends.

Maybe there will be a sequel in which he drives back home. :P",1418774400,5,1357,4.349206349206349

6361051,1,B00JJ3EH6C,"Looks great. Feels irritating, underwhelming, and uneventful.

Spoiler?

It's hard to talk about this movie without spoilers, I suppose. The trailers are so vague that most anything I can say may be s spoiler.

The film is presented in the trailer as something that may be fast-paced. Is this man a hit man? a con-man? I don't know, but he's done something he regrets. Turns out it's just a string of white collar problems with other slightly blue-collar problems. He stresses over these things throughout the film. He has all he could ever need in life and from a single mistake he makes, loses his mind over that. The entire drive he is taking in the film is based around a decision he is making, which is irrational and has no clear reasoning. This man is the project manager at some kind of concrete pour and I'm supposed to believe he's going to make THIS decision at this sort of turn in his life? And will someone tell me WHY or HOW on earth I'm supposed to care about a concrete pour happening on schedule??

Fortunately, Tom Hardy is a great actor. Unfortunately, he was given a script that lacked a decent premise or any real conflict within. The conflict in the film and general direction of everything in the story left me filled with so much disappointment, I held off reviewing this for 9 months just because I wanted to be as fair as possible.

The editing in the film bothered me as well. I understand the method they took in creating the film and I think that was a cool concept, but seemingly they may have been left with a lack of camera angles and good takes which is not the editors fault. I think they probably did well with what they had access too.

I really like films that take place all in one (or pretty much one) location however. Instead of this, I might recommend 'Buried', or even 'Phone Booth' (although a little over dramatic) or 'Panic Room'",1418688000,6,1876,4.470760233918129

This is a well-acted piece that likely was meant to be a Broadway one-man show, a show where the only character is the driver and his conversations with others over his cell phone.  Now Tom Hardy manages to pull this off exceptionally well, showing a range of emotions as he juggles work, his family life and his explaining his actions, meekly and reasonably at first, then a bit more forcefully later.  And the point of the entire film?  As the director says at the end, he wanted to show how many people had so many problems, that within each car we see on the road or freeway, there is a car with someone going through a major life transition.  Well, this is indeed something major for Tom Hardy (he had an affair) and nobody, not his work nor his family, understand. ""Only once,"" he calmly says, ""she means nothing.""  But the difference between once and never is huge, says his wife, and that's that.  Keep driving.

The writing is fantastic, and the performance is riveting.

Tom Hardy is the only face you see and he is phenomenal.  He's subtle, powerful, and a textbook of what actors should strive for in a performance.

Some of the pacing, music and the choice of blurred streets lights as a visual theme seem out of place and unworthy of the script and performance, but you'll forgive it.

6361141,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"Tom Hardy came to everyone's attention with his supporting performance in ""Inception"" then as the evil Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and most recently as Bob the bartender in ""The Drop.""  Earlier this year, a film hit the indi-screens called ""Locke"" where he is the only person on screen for the entire 85 minute running time.

Set in England, Ivan Locke steps into his BMW X3 after a day at his office where he is supervising the construction of a skyscraper.  A record load of concrete is to arrive the next morning and he is critical to the operation.  But he has other plans.  He is going to drive to London, some 90 minutes away (never to exceed the 80 kph speed limit!) as he has more pressing business there.  While I won't be too explicit, the little secret is divulged early in the film.  It appears that Ivan had a drunken experience several months earlier while on a temporary assignment which has now resulted in an unforeseen complication in his heretofore near perfect life.

During the drive, he works the BMW's Bluetooth phone constantly, alternating between his problem in London, his boss and subordinate at work and his wife and 2 teenage boys at home.  While I would never recommend dealing with these emotionally charged issues while driving, Locke believes he has no choice.  He even continues to manage the concrete pour after he's been fired for walking out on the job.  To unnecessarily complicate matters, director and screenwriter Steven Knight provide Locke with an imaginary father who rides in the back seat and becomes the target of Locke's barbs between phone calls.  Is Bob a little off?  It would have made more sense for invisible Dad to just be another person on the phone.

This one dimensional setting provides an opportunity for Hardy to deliver a performance to be remembered.  Alas that is the primary reason to see the film.  Is there tension?  Sure but it subsides as quickly as the film's running time.

The Blu ray version of the film that I watched includes an encoded 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Given the night time setting throughout the film, the black levels are critical and they are excellent.  About the only color added is the pale yellow of Hardy's skin tones, indicative of the overhead streetlights.  Most of the scenes come from inside the BMW using various interior and exterior cameras.  Although Hardy is not actually driving the car, for the most part he does what most actors do not.  He actually looks like he's driving!  The clarity and picture stability is excellent.  Nicely done.  The audio comes in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Minimalistic to be sure, but the surrounds are in play as traffic passes in both directions.  The audio score is supportive and well done.  Most importantly, the Bluetooth conversations are convincingly accurate.  The only extras are a commentary with the director and a 10 minute ""making of"" documentary.",1412035200,,2930,4.802

People talk about not being able to take your eyes off him...well you really don't have a choice do you?  He's the ONLY thing on screen. All the concrete talk was tedious, his accent was kooky, too many cutaways to the blurred out highway lights. There were a few funny highlights when the other actors called in, but Locke himself was completely unsympathetic. And the idea of ""real time"" was shattered for me right off the bat when we didn't see Locke remove his vest before sitting in the car. Then suddenly he's at a streetlight w/ just his sweater. There's no way he could remove that bulky clothing while sitting in the driver's seat.

6361150,3,B00JJ3EH6C,"I wanted to love Locke. The reviews of the movie and of Tom Hardy's performance have been stellar. It was shown at the Dallas International Film Festival and I missed it. Then it played at a couple of independent movie theaters, and I still missed it. So I was glad when it finally came to video.

Unfortunately, it was bit of a let-down. Tom Hardy's performance is fantastic, as is all the voice actors in the movie. The emotion that characters off-screen are able to convey is astounding. And the dialogue is extremely well-written.

The movie takes place in a car. Tom Hardy's character is the lone one that we see, and on this drive he endeavors to sort through a mistake of his past.

The problem with the movie - and the problem may have been mine - is that I was expecting a gripping thriller. The movie is a drama about a man's personal demons. Locke is a man of fiber and integrity. He is known for his hard work, his expertise, and the love of his family. He also has father issues, he's made a very bad mistake, and he wants to make it right. Propelled by the hurt his father inflicted on him, he decides that there is only one solution - to take this drive. The question is: is that decision the right one?

The movie feels like it takes place in real-time. Thus the drive seems very slow and even a bit tedious, at time. More importantly,  the nature of what Tom's character (Locke) is facing and the conversations that occur could have as easily taken place in his living room or at a coffee shop or in any other setting.

Quite honestly, Locke's biggest mistake is not confessing his misdeed sooner. Had he done so, he probably wouldn't have been taking that angst-filled drive. But then we are all human, and we don't always respond or act as we should.

So kudos to Locke for staring his mistakes in the face and grappling with them. I only wish his drive had ended sooner.",1411516800,11,1890,4.382857142857143

6361156,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"Before I go into details, I have a short message for anyone considering this movie: if you are not the type to enjoy a low-budgeted independent film with only 1 actor, 1 setting, and nothing besides the titular character speaking on the phone, PLEASE ignore this title. Do not buy it then get frustrated because it is not what you hope for. It's almost like buying a rom-com and getting upset because there's no blood and gore. If you can get past the things I mentioned, however, I think this is one of the most unique films I've ever seen in a while.

Since this film's main plot and style are very minimalistic to begin with, the other aspects of the movie have to be twice as strong in order to deliver. And yes, Locke does deliver. Tom Hardy is a great actor in his other films, but here he is at his best form. He can be compelling without having to scream or overact like several actors who can't achieve the same effect without those. Indeed, if Hardy were not as good as he is, this movie could potentially fail, as everything hinges upon how convincing this one and only character is. The cinematography, being mostly close shots, and low-key music combined to give the sense of pressure and urgency, and thanks to that even in the more quiet moments of the film, you still feel the tension lingering.
The thing that I like most about this film is that plot-wise it knows what it wants to deliver to the audience and manages to stay close to that throughout. I don't feel like 1 hour and a half for this dialogue-only film is too long, because there's no unnecessary moments. Every moment counts and contributes to the understanding of the protagonist, the people in his life, and the world he lives in. The main goal of Locke the protagonist is to prove to himself and his deceased father that he is a responsible man who will go to the end of the world to make sure he rights his wrong. Only this main point does the movie follow through and resolve. Other questions that inevitably come up are left to the audience to ponder upon. Doesn't Locke hurt more people he cares about in the process of saving this one particular woman he can't even love? Is he even rational or purely driven by his father complex? Does he really lose everything in the end? The movie does not resolve any of these, and simply ends when Locke arrives at the destination he initially set out for.
While it is not the best movie of all time in my opinion (though it's pretty darn great), it's likely to stay with you for a long time after the credit rolls",1411257600,,2569,4.431289640591967
6361157,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"I saw this movie on a long plane flight back to the US from England.  The other movies on offer were horrible.  Locke was the only interesting, thoughtful, and engaging movie.  The problematic of the movie confronting the character is so intense and gut-wrenching that I felt as though my insides were being ripped out.  If adultery, fathers abandoning their children, out of wedlock births, fidelity and contrition, marital trust, weakness and vulnerability -- if these themes have any hold on you, you will love this movie.

When I got back to the States and did some research on it, I read that the movie is an example of ""minimalist"" cinema, because it stars just one actor, and for its entire 90 minutes its action consists of him driving in a car and talking on the phone.  I have to confess that I did not even realize that it involved only one actor, and only one action (driving in a car).  The dialogue and plot were so vivid and complex, that it never entered my mind that the film was minimalistic.

Look, two of the other movies on offer on my flight were Godzilla and Spiderman.  If your idea of a good movie is a video game put on a big screen and stretched out to 120 minutes, then you'll probably love Godzilla and hate Locke.  If you are in a mood simply to be entertained, you might love Godzilla and you'll probably hate Locke.  But if you want a movie which engages you and forces you to think and makes you feel pain, and pity, and anger, and contempt, and impatience -- sometimes all at once but nearly always in rapid succession-- you might very well reach the same conclusion I did and think that Locke is one very good movie very much worth seeing.",1411257600,,1674,4.437908496732026

There are a lot of good and bad things you can say about this movie, but my disappointment really stems from the expectations I had. I think it's really dishonest to market this as a thriller (and just look at the image, with its streaks of light, suggesting Tom Hardy is playing a thrill-a-minute speed racer) when it's a drama.

It's one thing to be the headliner of a film, but quite another to carry the whole entire thing and be the only one on screen. Props for Tom. As far as the film itself, it's definitely a thinking person's film. There are several things going on at a time and metaphors galore. I loved it because I love dialog and that's the whole entire film, but if you're looking for an action movie, or something that's not to heavy, just to kill some time, this is not for you. And, to tell the truth, I think the people who reviewed it as being horrible just didn't get it, or they're simply not a fan of film with loads of dialog.

Locke is the type of film that stays with you long after the closing credits roll.  Tom Hardy is brilliant as Locke.  This is the ultimate ""fork in the road"" story told through hands free phone calls as Locke drives to his destination.  I don't want to include any spoilers but I will say that this is a thinking person's film.  There is a lot more to absorb and consider than one would think.  Do you consider Locke to be honorable or dishonorable?  What would YOU do in the same set of circumstances?  What does doing the right thing REALLY look like??

Simply can't be. The emotional intensity of Steven Knight's film (who wrote and directed the movie) carries you along, the viewer, as though you are also in the car, a silent witness, a watcher sitting just behind Hardyand dealing with an ongoing convoluted and personal crisis. There are so many facets to this movie that takes an ordinary man and ordinary circumstances of an ordinary life into the realm of the extraordinary, and every facet works to an optimum level. Who would think a narrative built around this compelling person who works for a concrete company could keep the viewer in that car for that 80-minute-ride on an English motorway, and hoping this man's disenfranchised life and circumstances with his loved ones and co-workers will somehow work out.

6361205,4,B00JJ3EH6C,"After watching this film --the opposite of a classic Road Trip-- for me, Tom Hardy *is* the new DeNiro.

There are a handful of things going on in this densely-packed movie, but maybe the most important one is figuring out what kind of man and what kind of will it takes to survive radical changes in every part of your life...overnight and save what needs saving. So it's not a war zone, it's not a gangbanger/spy/heist film: instead, you watch how a moderately successful guy deals with all the other kinds of things blowing up, the things that matter most, and tries to keep going.

This tightly bounded anti-Road Trip must be the toughest kind of role to act, and I don't even usually watch ""this kind of movie"".  Not saying it was easy to watch at first, but extraordinarily realistic!

The *it was all a dream* or single-concept scifi film, I usually stay away from those, because too often those movies seem like writer or director has lost track of the need to open the door of the story to include me --the audience -- in any way. But I stuck with this film. So about 15 minutes in, you get how utterly real this construction boss' situation is, how radically the stakes change, again and again, and you do watch, because you want to see if Ivan Locke (Hardy) will survive --and on whose terms. It's the most realistic film I've seen in a long while. Then there's the ghost rider in the back seat, maybe that touch makes it the true anti-Road Trip Road Trip!

All the changes, all the drama, and no gratuitous scene-chewing you'd get from many American actors who might've attempted this role. There's only one American that could've carried it off, and he's dead: Philip Seymour Hoffman. Yes, it's a British film, but I've worked in construction Stateside, and massive construction projects are prey to the same challenges of politics and materials everywhere.

At first it didn't hit me, but the warning of Locke's freaked out site manager who shouts ""Chicago is f***ing pissed* ups the ante, because who wants to disappoint the Mafia?

I did fast forward 127 Hours with The Franco though, but I already knew the real-life story.

The character of Locke is bound to his concept of himself as someone who is in control, consistent, conscientious, and sworn to conduct befitting the legacy he has crafted for himself and his family name. His spouse & colleagues also describe him as someone who has always followed  these character tenets. For Locke, his path in life must deviate from that of his despised father. When the consequences of one, solitary act of kindness threaten to derail his carefully constructed life, he makes a ""decision"" to follow through with a commitment.

His unraveling is depicted during a long trip via auto away from his home, where he is juggling the 11th-hour details of the most major construction project of his career via phone. He makes confessions, handles seemingly insurmountable obstacles at his work site, and encounters emotional backlash from all sides yet remains resolute to not deviate from his course. With so much to lose, one wonders why this trip is so important but the viewer gleans that it is because he cannot allow himself to follow in his father's footsteps, even if it means losing everything he values. This character development is more in-depth than most characters in movies but necessary to engross viewers due to the limitations of a one-scene setting throughout the movie.

The movie plot had so much room to add to the ending but left viewers hanging. There was certainly more that occurred after the car trip ended but viewers did not know what to expect. I think a more concrete (pun intended) ending would have upped my number of review stars by one.",1408752000,,2128,4.80327868852459

I can usually find entertainment in all kinds of movies, even old silent movies, b-movies, westerns, musicals, noir, comedies with little merit, and even some of the recent teen movies, but holy crap batman, this movie was horrendous. Watching paint dry is more exciting.

With all the amazing reviews and Hardy usually in good movies, I was expecting something like Hitchcock's Rope, which took place in real time and in only one setting (an apartment), but I was fooled; my time would have been better spent reading a how-to book on paper mache. My jaw drops in disbelief when I hear positive reviews of Locke.  It's like if I took a blank canvas, signed it, and people said ""ah yes (in a snooty voice) I feel the complexity of the artist's emotions, it's brilliant!"" - No! it's a blank canvas, there's nothing there, just like there's nothing there in Locke.  Best used by people with chronic insomnia.

When we realized how bad this movie was, we started placing bets on who would call next.  Trying to be funny I said the newborn would call next, but alas, near the end of the movie he answers a call (which is all Locke does for 90 minutes, answers calls) and the newborn was on the line.  I'm sure all the weirdos leaving positive reviews thought this was touching....but this was ridiculous.

Looking forward to the sequel when Locke drives to the grocery store and on his way there gets suspenseful and thrilling calls from telemarketers, a reminder of his vasectomy on Wednesday, asks his wife if they're out of milk and other fascinating events (...it's so real life, it's so good).

In this film 'Locke', that is exactly what occurs, but you will be the observer of a one man dialogue with everyone who means something to him as he drives to his destination. Boring, not for a minute, put in your seatbelt and let's go.

Tom Hardy plays Locke, a man who gets into his BMW, and takes a long, fateful drive. The camera doesnt always stay in the car, but its with Locke for entire time. We hear the voices of others, but we don't see anyone else. This is a breath taking film, as we observe Locke take his life apart, one person at a time. Locke is a foreman in construction who is now asking his underling to take on the most important job of his career. All the while Locke's life us coming apart, and we see his face and his Rolodex as he moves onto the next person. We don't know what is happening right away, we only know Locke has made a momentous decision.

We know Locke is righting a wrong, and as we speed along with him in his BMW, we wonder would we have the guts to do this? This takes courage, and as you slowly realize what is going on, it dawns on you that we are in the middle of a life's mess. The conclusion is a bit disappointing, but I saw it coming and was prepared. I urge you to take this drive, move along with Locke. Well done, sir.

6361268,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"I've loved Tom Hardy ever since Warrior, Batman, Inception, and Lawless. This minimal film is very deep on many levels, one is symbolism. The parallels of the main character building his own new life and building a foundation to a structural building work quite well. Driving in darkness and controlling his future works as a force of uncertainty yet a sense of confidence comes through with character. Choice and fate play a major role in this film, the character's battle between the 2 become his inner demon. There are a lot of philosophical musings sprinkled throughout the entire film without coming off too over the top. Failure, fault and ambition and madness go hand in hand. Themes of power, weakness, fault, self redemption, and change are explored through the film. Since the view is so minimal it forces the viewer to dissect and analyze the smallest details and lines in the film to give the viewer more.

Tom Hardy gives one of his finest performances, the character he plays a very multi dimensional man. Everything from sadness, frustration, regret, anger, stress, confidence, excitement, calmness, logic, irrational behavior, confusion, madness could be expressed. If it wasn't for such a strong performance this film may have not worked so well. This film is very edgy, showing the physical view of a driver only, people on the other end of the line are left up for the imagination. Shots of the car interior, the cars outside and the city are blurred a bit into reality. It almost feels like watching a stage play.

It takes place entirely inside the interior of a moving BMW with the driver, concrete executive Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy), juggling various balls as the life he knows unravels around him.  Locke has a steely reserve and you can see the tumblers in his head working as he calmly talks to the car speaker phone undeterred from his destination that night, to be at the side of the woman who is not his wife giving birth to his child.  Hardy's Locke is one of the more brilliant performances of the year.  In lesser hands the character would be more histrionic but Hardy speaks in hushed deliberate tones to best extricate himself from imminent disaster.  Director Steven Knight neatly captures the requisite mood of dimly lit rain swept English interstates being the compass for Locke's journey.

I was not bored during this movie. Hardy is good, as always, and I really wanted to see where the movie went. The problem is, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. Hardy's main issue is revealed early on.

I struggle with 3 stars on this. I've no doubt some people would watch this and feel incredibly pissed off, and want to give it a 1. Others appear to really like it (rottentomatoes and others have reviewed it very well). For me it was middle of the line. I'm not upset I watched it, but I just wanted more wrapped up.

This is also revealed early on: Locke is the foreman to a massive construction project worth tens of millions of dollars, and the morning after his drive there is to be the biggest concrete pour in Europe's history outside of military projects. Despite this being the most important day on surely the most important project of his career, and one that not only is worth huge amounts of money but affects hundreds of other lives, I found it quite implausible that he would have skipped it for the reason given in the movie.

6361279,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"'Locke' represents drama stripped down to essentials, and film-making that is willing to take huge risks in order to create a profound character study; it is also an examination of the consequences of being a flawed but deeply moral person. It forces the viewer to ask very hard questions about their own values. Is there a point at which you will abandon the very beliefs that define a person, in order to avoid causing pain to both yourself and your family?

Taking place in real time, 'Locke' follows the title character on his long ride to the hospital, where he is hell-bent on witnessing the birth of his child and supporting the mother -- who is virtually a stranger. With a wife and two sons at home, Locke is determined not to abandon the lonely woman with whom he had a one night stand, and more importantly, to be there for the birth of his 'bastard' child; he grew up without a father himself, and has vowed to not repeat his father's mistakes.

The entire film takes place in the vehicle, not a single scene or shot beyond it's claustrophobic confines. The car itself could represent the uncompromising ethics that become like a prison, or a coffin, forcing him to take actions he knows will cause pain and damage to everyone around him. But operating within those tight parameters, it is impossible for him to act any other way.

Locke speaks to a number of people via hands-free cell-phone, and the closer he gets to the maternity ward, the farther away his family and his career become. In order to attend the birth, he deserts his post as a highly respected structural engineer, despite the fact that the cement is to be poured for the foundations of a huge, record-breaking project the next morning. Without him checking the details and the scheduling, the pour could turn out to be an utter failure worth tens of millions of dollars. Instead of lying to his employer, feigning serious illness, he tells him the truth... and is fired. Despite this, Locke is convinced only he can ensure the job's success, and scrambles to direct his not particularly competent assistant through the process, desperately trying to counter the many problems and potential disasters that arise.

And then there's the wife and kids. I won't get into details, but given the kind of man Locke is, it's easy to hypothesize what might happen with them. This is absolutely brilliant existential storytelling in the tradition of Jean-Paul Sarte's 'The Wall' or Albert Camus' 'L'Etranger'; It is just as much a moral riddle as it is a character study, with some of the most finely crafted dialogue you'll ever hear. If 'Buried' was impressive in it's minimalist audacity, 'Locke' is twice so. There are no terrorists, or venomous snakes, no death-clock counting down to the point when there's no more air to breathe. Just a man in his car with a cell-phone, willing to lose both his family and his career before sacrificing his principles. The complexity of the questions raised are such that it's hard to decide if Locke is an admirable person for facing up to the consequences of his one mistake; or is he selfish? Is he letting his neurotic feelings about his own father overwhelm his personal responsibilities to his family and employers? Wouldn't it be better for everyone if he got over himself and forgot that fling and that woman and their unborn child even existed? Ivan Locke's willingness to sacrifice himself, his 'life', so to speak, for his uncompromising values, establishes him as a new fictional archetype: the 21st Century martyr.

It's not light entertainment, but it is riveting, far more suspenseful than you might expect. Tom Hardy, one of the most talented actors of his generation, with award-worthy roles in 'Bronson' and 'Inception', deserves an Oscar for this performance. Unlike many young actors, who are unable to successfully divest their own traits from the role, relying on good looks and charisma, Tom Hardy disappears in this performance, becoming Ivan Locke. The hard layers of restraint in his personality, the measured Welsh inflections, are 100% 'character', with 0% trace impurities of 'actor'. The writing and directing are absolutely flawless. One of the best films of the year. {94/100}",1407801600,61,4220,4.880055788005579

6361281,5,B00JJ3EH6C,"This kind of movie only comes once in a great while , and i'm so glad that distributors released it in U.S , LOCKE"" is a story about taking responsibilities for the actions one might have caused in the past , and those actions have now reflected on this character , its about hard choices and sacrifices one must do deep inside his or her soul , to do the right thing .

Without giving anything away as far as the plot , that's the reason why i described it above. The idea of a Character inside a car and a one direction journey choice he had made , was a brilliant idea by writer and director ""Stephen Knight""

The whole Movie takes place in a Car and on the real Highways in U.K , and my kudos to Mr. Knight , for doing so . Tom Hardy performance in the car while talking on the in car cellular phone , is something you have to watch to truly connect and appreciate this actor , I'm now convinced , that ""Tom Hardy"" can play any role they throw at him , This is the kind of Movie where actor truly gets tested & what can he deliver , and  Tom has delivered way and beyond in his performance. His expression in the eyes and emotions that ""Tom"" creates should be recognized by ""Academy Awards"" and other International Awards as well .

I Highly recommend this movie , it is once in a lifetime performance that reflects within all of us in real life .",1407542400,,1351,4.106060606060606

6361283,2,B00JJ3EH6C,"The entire film takes place in a car. Not just bits and pieces, the whole thing. Locke (Tom Hardy) is driving to London to see the birth of his child by a one night stand. It will take him about 90 minutes, and like a Hemingway novel, it is done in real time. Ivan spends almost the entire trip on the phone and when he is not on the phone he talks to his deceased father.

Ivan decides he needs to do the right thing by being at the birth of his child because of his poor relationship with his father. He imagines everything will be good afterwards. He takes calls from his son watching the football match. He has told his wife what has happened, and she is not dealing with it very well. The woman giving birth has issues as he talks to her and the hospital staff. Ivan is the foreman over a large concrete pour that will happen in his absence. He has to deal with corporate while micro managing a drinking worker through his job over the phone. He does so very cool and collectively, yet things don't go his way.

The film never went anywhere. After 20 minutes or so in the car, I was groaning as I knew this was going to be another one man play. Fans of ""Vehicle 19"" or ""Buried"" should love this one too. Oh the drama.

Worst of all is his horrible ""accents"" he speaks in, even hack actors can do decent acccents. This guy sounds ridiculous every time I hear him. He sounds just like Sid from Ice Age in Venom, WHY would he want to sound like a cartoon character? He doesn't, its his fail at an American accent, he stinks.

He messed up, he regrets it and he wants to deal with it like a man. The movie is about that choice of taking responsibility after a failure. Probably Tom Hardy's best role, moved him up a notch for me to being an actor that actually wants to say something with his career. Better than appealing to the movie watchers who can't think beyond a basic plot. Those that didn't like this, probably wanted an action flick that Tom does so well. But Tom can't limit his career to just those roles. This movie is by far my favorite.",1530230400,,640,4.297520661157025
