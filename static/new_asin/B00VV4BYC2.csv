7112918,1,B00VV4BYC2,"Bottom line-- possibly THEmost poorly executed film ever made. While the intent may have been to make a thought provoking film the production quality is so bad it became totally unwatchable.. why? Because whoever ran the sound decided to crank up the music track way over top of the voice track!
At ever point where they talk about some important piece of information you cannot hear what they say... the music IS TOO LOUD!
One other point.. they make no effort to explain the strange way the main female character is the daughter but the main male character is the grandson?! Huh!
Save your money please.. very very bad production quality.",1442016000,3,640,4.774774774774775

Unbelievably lame.",1531180800,,59,5.666666666666667

8711383,3,B00VV4BYC2,"You would think the pastor would know his Bible.  Humans made in the image of God do not become angels at death; please see Hebrews 1-2, 1 Corinthians 6:3, 1 Peter 1:10-12 and 2 Peter 2:4 (just for starters). There is something much more glorious awaiting those who are united to Christ by grace through faith (which is a gift from God -> Ephesians 2). It's a nice story - if you want a good clean story and some likeable characters, it's good for that. But, through-and-through it's saturated with more of a Christianised therapeutic deism than biblical Christianity - which can be good for some teaching moments with the kids and an open Bible to help them identify modern unbiblical ideas from the glorious truth, so that they can know an even greater hope than what the movie provides.",1527552000,,789,4.635714285714286
8711384,5,B00VV4BYC2,"This is a wonderful movie. Very thought provoking and could possibly change lives if only people would heed the message within.

An earlier response put down the movie for not revealing why the main female character is the daughter but the main male is the grandson, but I can tell you that the movie does indeed reveal why. So please do not take another person's misguided review to heart because it is all there.

The movie is indeed a lower budget movie but that does not mean it is lower quality either. It cuts right to the heart and delivers a strong message that leaves you in tears.

Please do give this movie a chance. Perfect for families as there is no violence, no cuss words, no sex. Just a pure, wholesome movie with a sound message for all to learn and grow by. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1524700800,,794,4.424657534246576
