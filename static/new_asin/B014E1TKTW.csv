7389608,1,B014E1TKTW,It was a really good movie up until the last 10 minutes of the movie when there was language. We we're so surprised to hear this in a Christian movie.,1455580800,4,150,4.033333333333333

7389640,2,B014E1TKTW,"Way too much artistic liberty and supposition.

Not very accurate per Scripture.

They tried to hard for special effects and drama, and kinda lost their way in making this is my best guess.

Glad they tried, but do not want to dilute my thoughts in it and do not advise the same.",1504483200,,279,4.326923076923077

7389642,4,B014E1TKTW,Obviously not a big budget picture but very competently and faithfully done.  I really enjoyed it. Not always easy when you know what is going to happen before it does.,1497139200,,168,4.6

7389662,4,B014E1TKTW,"I enjoyed this portrayal of Saul. I felt it was well done. My only complaint would be that I felt it ended abruptly. Otherwise, the best I've seen.",1485302400,,147,4.285714285714286
7389663,4,B014E1TKTW,Good,1484956800,,4,4.0
7389664,4,B014E1TKTW,"Very enjoyable.  Details were somewhat shallow, but it is a movie afterall and only made to fit in a particular time slot.  Everyday life continued so the additions of life stories, although not biblical is a given.  The moral of the story was allowed to come through:  God's love for the world was revealed through His son Jesus Christ.  His words of love and forgiveness is mankind's only hope. Once understood, one can never be the same - I am a witness to that.  Praise God!",1481414400,5,478,4.5

7389678,4,B014E1TKTW,"Some dramatic license, but it may be OK given that it emphasizes element of Paul's conversion that otherwise might be ignored. Overall, worthwhile viewing.",1476662400,2,155,5.5
7389679,1,B014E1TKTW,Religion does more harm than good.  Quit wasting your time.,1475798400,,59,4.9
7389680,4,B014E1TKTW,"Fairly good movie.  Set aside that it doesn't perfectly match with scripture.
People say there is profanity in the film.  I only remember one curse word and it wasn't uttered by a 'Christian'.",1472428800,2,192,4.787878787878788

7389684,2,B014E1TKTW,personally they put way to much imagination into it. The back story. I just didn't feel like it followed scripture all that well. Some ones interpretation. Not for me,1467590400,3,166,4.758620689655173

It was good but not good on going word for word.",1461283200,3,91,3.6
7389704,5,B014E1TKTW,"I am very impressed with this movie. It is a high quality film, with good acting. The storyline is mostly true to the Bible with only minor additional content, such as the wedding that was interrupted by Saul. Even so, this was acceptable as the Scripture does say that Saul went from place to place rounding up believer. As a biblicist, I am very particular about taking away or adding to Bible stories. All in all, this is a wonderful resource for Christians. I pray that the producers would consider creating more films like this.",1458000000,11,533,4.621052631578947

8730457,5,B014E1TKTW,Great New DVD for My Movies on Saint Paul..,1527465600,,43,3.888888888888889
8730458,4,B014E1TKTW,"I wish that this movie had went into more detail about Paul's life after he became a Christian. They did take a lot of liberties. The one thing it did for me is show just how awful Saul was before he became a Christian. Reading the Bible about Saul you form in your mind how bad Saul was but seeing it showed how Jesus can take such a sinner and use him in such a way. We were all sinners before we came to Christ and Paul said he was ""the chief sinner."" Before I repented of my sins and accepted Jesus Christ as my savior I too felt like I was the chief of sinners. Overall a good movie but beware there are two curse words which should had been left out.",1527379200,,656,3.9398496240601504
