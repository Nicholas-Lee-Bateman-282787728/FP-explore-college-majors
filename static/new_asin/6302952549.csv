From the first time I read this book,I was afraid but when I got to the end I found out that it was a very nice book in life for me. When I read some of the opinion it discourage me about this beautiful book. When I was a young girl I asked my dad that I always want to be a mermaid in the future. My dad never disappoint me. I really like this book although it frightened the children sometimes but when you understand well about the book then you can feel the important of the book to you and your kids in the future. The only thing I'm saying is that Gongratulation to all the people and all tha charaters in this book. You know what few men are now trying to do what they first wanted to do it takes Courage to take a broken plan and make a great thing of it. Keep up the good work and try your best to let the world know that we can do anything if we put our heart into it. And the most important thing in life is that Pray is the key for everything. With a beautiful greetings from Feauina Filipo of American Samoa Community College.",1121904000,,1129,3.9130434782608696
7832520,1,6302952549,"Worst anime I have ever seen.  The plot is non-existant, the animation is terrible, and it's just boring throughout the entire anime.  What was the point?  What was it even about?  I still can't figure that out.  Pick up something made by Miyazaki instead, like Kiki's Delivery Service or Spirited Away.  Those are classics, this is just rubbish.",1052265600,2,346,4.879310344827586
7832521,2,6302952549,"For those people who are familiar with Rumiko Takahashi's OAV works, this is probably the weakest of the lot released in North America.  Unfortunately, the video has been released only in dubbed format to date.  The story itself is decent and has a nice twist a la Takahashi to keep  viewer interest and indeed takes the viewers a touch of guard later on as  more detail is revealed. Likewise, the action towards the end of the video  keeps things interesting for viewers, however the weaknesses to the video  outweigh the strengths. A good story, yes as well as a good musical score  which strengthens the overall viewing experience. However, even with the  musical score, there are problems. The mixing of the music compared to the  vocal track is just a bit too misbalanced such that after scenes with  strong action, it's difficult to make out the dialogue. Either that or you  get blasted out of your seats from the music following a quieter scene. A  shame really since the music is rather decent.
Indeed, the first thing  to strike viewers as they watch the opening to this OAV is the musical  score. Well scored, the music sweeps viewers along into what sounds like  will be a grand adventure. Decidedly reminiscent of the musical score to  Arislan Senki, it brings images of beautiful ocean and landscapes to mind.  No real surprise considering that the same composer is responsible for  scoring the music for both OAVs.
Personally, I don't tend to watch many  dubs as I find that the voice acting is often rather painful to listen to.  Unfortunately, while this isn't the worst I've heard, it isn't all that  great either. The voice acting is much weaker at the beginning of the OAV  as the voice actors seem to have little if any understanding of their  characters personalities. This lack of direction for the voice actors makes  the earlier parts of the OAV rather dull and the acting decidedly  lacklustre. Some of the awkwardness in line delivery however, is also due  to the translations and the script. While I don't have the original version  to compare the dialog with, it's quite apparent that there are some cases  of very literal translations. (Make a good bride? Not a good wife, or a  lovely bride?) This along with some looser translations makes for an  overall somewhat awkward dialogue. While there are a few instances of  stronger language, it didn't entirely fit with the overall dialogue making  the end result rather strange; it was hardly necessary to add them in as  the rest of the dialogue was decidedly on the clean side.
The animation  itself is much weaker than what would be expected of an OAV series with  judicious use of pan and holds as well as lots of still backgrounds.  Likewise, the smoothness in animation isn't as good as we've come to expect  especially for OAVs and the amount of detail in the scenes is also  decidedly lacking here.
All in all, this OAV would make an okay rental  but personally, unless you're a die-hard Takahashi or Rumik World fan, I'd  give this one a pass. If you can ignore the voice acting, and are desperate  for a dark adventure, then this might be for you.",965779200,3,3135,4.699815837937385
