8097194,5,B000CCBCBW,A couple of good chick flicks at a good price.  I find Billy Crystal and John Cusack to be very funny.,1510876800,,102,3.857142857142857
8097195,5,B000CCBCBW,"I absolutely LOVE both of these movies.  I already own both but someone (probably a teenaged child, lol) damaged my copy of America's Sweethearts, so I needed another copy.  Finding the 2 together worked out well since it is never a bad idea to have a ""back up"" of favorite movies when you have many children..... ;)  It arrived on time and in good condition, so not much else to say.",1453593600,,384,4.380281690140845
8097196,4,B000CCBCBW,Forget about the double deal you will get with 2 movies. Mona Lisa smile is great but America's sweetheart forget it.,1451174400,,117,4.619047619047619

8097202,4,B000CCBCBW,"I'm a big fan of most, if not all, of Julia Roberts movies and the same goes for here. Mona Lisa's Smile is one of my favorite movies and America's Sweethearts is something real simple (over-the-top) that I feel in love with. Mona Lisa's is a story that involves a teacher who shows up at an all-girl's school and gives reason for many of them to re-think their present and future roles as women in society. I like both movies.....watched over and over.",1236297600,7,453,4.469879518072289
