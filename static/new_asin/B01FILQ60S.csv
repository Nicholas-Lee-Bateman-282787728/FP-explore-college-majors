7750033,4,B01FILQ60S,"For fans of Atop the Fourth Wall, this movie is freaking awesome. The banter between the reviewers echos the old Channel Awesome Anniversary Movies, the special effects are great, and Linkara himself is as snarky as ever. Plus, the movie really flows a lot better as one long event rather than the 5 separate parts on YouTube.",1464480000,3,326,4.7368421052631575
8760829,5,B01FILQ60S,"I remember watching this when it was originally released, and can't believe it took me so long to finally purchase a copy.
Great humor, and all of the acting in it is top notch!

If you are a fan of any of the individuals in the movie, you should give this a try, it's totally worth it!
But poor Pollo, he needs those arms! ^_^",1523318400,,327,4.030769230769231
8760830,1,B01FILQ60S,"An overly long film. that's sadly as dull as it is predictable. it full of bad acting, bad sets and bad props. in fact it looks like there budget was only $1",1522627200,,157,3.9375
8760831,5,B01FILQ60S,"it was great, an excellent continuation of the channel awesome story taking place after to boldly flee. Lewis has a truly creative mind to bring aspects from his own show and that of the rest of the channel awesome universe. 5 stars!",1521417600,,233,4.571428571428571
8760832,4,B01FILQ60S,"LOOK: do not buy this video until you've gone to http://atopthefourthwall.com/ and begun watching Linkara's ""storyline"" episodes first. Otherwise you won't understand the jokes or know who any of the characters are. If you HAVE done that and you're already a fan, this movie picks up where Nostalgia Critic's ""To Boldly Flee"" left off. Also, very confusing unless you've already seen that. So, as somebody who has already been watching Linkara's videos for a while and who has already seen ""To Boldly Flee,"" I actually liked this movie a lot. Lewis ""Linkara"" Lovhaug has a great sense of humor which he uses to point out both the giant absurdities that we science fiction fans seem to have no problem accepting in our favorite comic books and movies; as well as the equally absurd level of passion with which we will critique, nitpick, and fiercely debate everything about them. I am one such geek and that is why I liked this little flick.",1475193600,,940,4.808641975308642

8760836,4,B01FILQ60S,"I already watched the online version but I'm still glad to have purchased the DVD.
Having watched most of the add-on content, I can say the majority of it is very enjoyable, if a bit reliant on Linkaras special brand of humor.
Pros:
The making of special is as funny as it is informative and is made even better if you watched the dirrectors commentary before hand.
The Caylestis crew short is surprisingly good for something that was just thrown together.
The movie itself was extemely entertaining, obviously.
Cons:
""The story so far"" is nearly impossible to follow for anyone who doesn't actually know the story so far, not helped by cinema snob playing the role of 90's kid and lupa playing the role of iron liz, with both costumes consiting mainly of sticky notes. Perhaps having dailogue over title card art of the characters would have been a bit better.
The main commentary is desynced due to the extended intro.
There is no scene select and skipping forward or back can lead to some weird glitches.

The only part of the dvd I haven't touched yet is the fat gradma commetary, so no idea if it's synced up or not, but I'd doubt it'd matter in the long run.",1466467200,,1164,4.542857142857143
8760837,5,B01FILQ60S,"after watching all the special features and the movie(both normal and with director commentary) I can say it's great. this is a definitive must have for any fan of AT4W(atop the fourth wall) as it perfectly showcase's the combination of comedy and emotion that draw viewer's into the plot's. (weird thing to say about a comic book review show but it's true) it also feature's a pitch perfect supporting cast. I do recommend watching the show first for new viewers as it is heavily reliant on the continuity/shared history of the characters, there is one flaw with the dvd though, the commentary track I listened too seemed 10-20 seconds ahead of the movie most of the time. over-all I would recommend this over most ""must see"" tv shows and a LOT of the biggest movie's that have come out this year.",1466294400,,798,4.666666666666667
