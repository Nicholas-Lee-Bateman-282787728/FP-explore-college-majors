First thing wrong is the story. There is just not a good story here. I can't fully explain without spoiling the plot but it's just so thin. The acting is actually good, Eric McCormack delivers a healthy performance. I guess he really needed the money after Will & Grace. My biggest complaint about this movie is the overwhelming darkness. You can't see anything. I found myself yelling at the characters to turn on the lights. A talented director could make the tone of his film dark but still light his actors, but in this movie it really feels like the film's projector bulb is dim. And when the movie ends, you find yourself saying, that's it? It has the most lame explanation ever. Sorry, but pass this one up.",1466294400,2,867,4.391304347826087
