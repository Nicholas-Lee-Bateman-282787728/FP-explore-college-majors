8708137,1,B00USBLXWU,"I grabbed a chance lately to see this sequel since I enjoyed the first Hayride very much.  I sat through it giving it every chance to either live up to the first or to be better.  Well unfortunately not only does this movie prove way too plodding even at the earlier parts of it, but it just never really does manage to speed up for any real time.  It never really packs the thrills either.

The slow pace of this film was unbearable, but it just didn't manage to deliver on anything else that either makes a good sequel(in general) much less a good slasher movie.

To elaborate, the kill scenes a dull in that not only are the majority of the kills off camera, but, there's nothing impressive about any of them.  Pitchfork does really lame things like snapping necks and knocking people against the wall.  He tosses a molatov cocktail at a victim with no possible way of getting one any where.  WHAT?!  Other times you never really do know what he does to his victims.  He doesn't even get his pitchfork until nearly 65 minutes in.  Of all corny and forced clich's the pitchfork just happened to be there.

There's next to no gore in the kill scenes.  So if you're as in the market for some cool scenes of gore as I am then you're best looking elsewhere.  To be fair several slashers in the past have managed to deliver on great style, intensity, and excellent scares and did so with very little gore.  Such as John Carpenter's Halloween and Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  This is just not like those movies at all.  Not even close!

 This movie is too damn talky in its misplaced attempt at character development, but unfortunately it's either wasted on characters that get killed shortly after or for characters that live, but you have to withstand one long-winded flashback too many that don't play into the plot in any relevant way.  Also the scenes of dialogue are too long, too many, too boring, and are another thing that just doesn't really go anywhere.  Is there a horror/slasher or a long bio?  Often times it's hard to tell that this was intended to be a slasher.  The suspense isn't particularly there either; considering how when there is a scene of killing you don't really get time to anticipate when.  The one thing that needed to slow down some and they couldn't seem that get that right either.

There's no sex, no nudity, no partying, no humor, and nobody celebrating Halloween.  No fun scenes of any kind.  In the first movie there's emphasis on Halloween with the hayride, but this time not only does the ""Hayride"" title have no real purpose, but the holiday, Halloween also takes a big backseat.

The characters are all dullards and the cops fall into incredibly forced redneck clich's.  There's nobody that's even relatable in this movie.

This movie did allow for the Friday the 13th type wooded scenes, the Halloween II(1981) hospital scenes, and a little bit with the backwoods isolation of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but not much is really done with any of these trappings.

Overall, if you enjoyed the first Hayride movie then you'll be out of luck here.  This just doesn't have any of the well written character development of the first, greatly lacks in the relatable characters, it moves a lot slower, and in general it totally and disgracefully ignores all the great ideas that the basic formula to a great slasher, has offered before.  To make matters worse this movie goes on for an undeserving 89 minutes with the last six going on forever.  With no real gore, no fun scenes of any kind, no nudity, and super lame characters that there's no reason to care about, this movie just shoots itself in the foot in every way possible.",1448409600,,3670,4.612654320987654

8708142,2,B00USBLXWU,"Writer/ director Terron R. Parsons' ""Hayride 2"" is yet another run of the mill slasher movie that is conflicted with confident production values and fair performances but suffers from too much dialogue that sounds like it belongs in a soap opera. This is highlighted by sappy characterizations where the cliched personalities which populate the screen spew long winded flashback dialogue which feels as if they don't know where to go with the story and are padding its bloated 92 minutes any way possible that follow suit with the ridiculously contrived words that come out of the characters' mouths.

  The references to ""Halloween 2"" (this one also takes place in a hospital), ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" (some of the nods to the recent ""Hatchet"" franchise are a bit more sly) are too obvious and transparent to have the intended effect of wit. Since most of the film is the archetypal characters giving us their life stories and going through various displays of emotion (a laughable, forced attempt at character development is my best guess as to why this is so prevalent here) that it has hardly any time to build any of the trademarks of effective horror: suspense. Because of this the pace lags. Once the heavy blabbering is done the characters simply go through predictable slaher motions and all we get from all the dialogue is a reminder of how empty the story is and how the pace lags.

  There is actually some promise for the first fifteen minutes as we flashback to the first film. ""Hayride 2"" displays familiar motions in this early portion but it is done with a directorial flare that inexplicably turns into a standard, point and shoot, just get it done style. The writing and progressively less imaginative kills by the masked villian follows suit and gives the impression that the filmmakers wanted to do something special but simply didn't have the time or budget to see their dreams come to fruition. Regardless of this it does sport claustrophobic cinematography, a surprisingly atmospheric veneer throughout that deserves a better quality feature.

  The original ""Hayride"" in 2012 wasn't exactly groundbreaking, it too was routine, but it was an aggressive thrill ride that went down well and offers a respectable way to kill a little over an hour and a half of your life. This time the joy of the ride is stilted by a promise that takes an unexpected turn into Sequelville and fails to deliver by hardly making any attempt to even replicate the familiar turns (as sequels often do) that made the original a semi-pleasant experience. Most sequels resort to something, usually upping the volume of blood and guts to keep audiences attention, this, in retrospect, doesnt even deliver in this most primal arena making Hayride 2 a joyless trek through a cinematic wasteland where all it has to grip us is the contemplations of its various shortcomings and failures and its Lets hurry up and get this done feel makes these errors all the more apparent.",1431129600,5,2991,4.883629191321499
