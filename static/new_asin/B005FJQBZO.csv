4681103,5,B005FJQBZO,"It is the only novela of which I'm aware that is released on DVD having all, full, uncut episodes. And, for 63 episodes, it is packaged at a very affordable price! Even American TV seasons, with an average of 22 episodes, or HBO seasons, with an average of 12 episodes, cannot come close to the price of this most-watched and award-winning novela.  It comes with the original music (and video) as well as a ""greatest moments"" extra that was also broadcast during the novela's US run.

Yes, there are no subtitles. And it would really have been nice to have at least an English and a Spanish set.  However, I think this was a cost trade-off. Besides, most of us 'novela watchers' either already know or have learned the Spanish language, right?

These episodes are as they were broadcast and that means that some of them start with a reprise of previous highlighted events.  Also, there is the constant insertion of the song/title screen at every point where the show came back from a commercial.  In a DVD set, I would prefer that this 'extraneous' material be gone so that I could watch the novela more fluidly as a 'movie'.  Again, this is not that important.  And, if one were to watch an episode per night, there is something to be said about keeping integrity of the novela experience as it was originally broadcast.  It's a judgement and a cost call and I really can't say which way is better.  Perhaps if this DVD succeeds in sales, leading the way to future novela releases, that there will be an option to turn off the previous event highlights and commercial-return segments for those who want a more fluid view of the novela.

In my opinion, this is a really great set of DVDs and a wonderful novela.",1323388800,19,1711,4.5588235294117645

4681105,5,B005FJQBZO,"As a long-time watcher of Hispanic novellas, there are three that I would consider memorable: Corazon Salvaje, Ramona, and La Reina del Sur.  Historical in nature, they all are superbly acted and produced.  La Reina is the last one we enjoyed and are happy to recommend to anyone who appreciates a good story well told.  The television version had English subtitles, but as one who speaks Spanish poorly, I did not require translation--the action conveyed and the language proved suficiently understandable to keep me glued to the screen.  A fine piece of film-making that rivals anything in its drama content and realism that Hollywood can produce.  This edition comes in two volumes and my review applies to both equally.",1322352000,2,723,5.042016806722689

4681108,5,B005FJQBZO,"I picked this up at the store because frankly I am Novela deprived. I live in the UK thanks to the USAF and we do not get any sort of Spanish show out here. What I get are condensed versions on two discs of year long novelas and that just aint right. So when this DVD set said it was complete and un-cut I figured, WHO CARES what its about I just need to have it.

I WAS IN LOVE FROM EPISODE ONE! I could not stop watching it. I found myself wanting to take a DVD player to work so that I could continue watching it. I CANNOT wait to find out what happens to Teresa and to see who she makes alliances with next. I find myself cheering when she is able to find justice and saying prayers during episodes that her character doesn't get caught. I am so engrossed in the story that sometimes I FORGET that it is a story.

I will anxiously await volume two to arrive because I CANNOT wait to see what happens next in this heroines life. And she is a heroine, for she has been pushed down 20 steps to gain 1. Not necessarily a role model but a woman of strength to admire, for sure.",1318896000,21,1076,4.0
4681109,3,B005FJQBZO,"This telenovela is one of the best ever made however, they failed to include any subtitles whatsoever! No Spanish or English subtitles. Guess Telemundo-Universal doesn't care about those who are hearing impaired.  I am just dumbfounded that they failed to include that which was original to the show...subtitles.  The show became a hit in its 10pm time slot, this was thanks to a significant number of viewers who were able to follow along with the English subtitles...guess universal doesn't want to appeal to that fan base. Just when I thought I could erase my recordings of the show...well I'm glad that I didn't because those recordings have the subtitles. These DVDs were a waste of money. minus 2 stars for no subtitles, come on universal I'm hard of hearing give me subtitles in any language!",1318204800,91,799,4.911111111111111

4681128,1,B005FJQBZO,"I love telenovelas and the actress Kate del Castillo,  however, I feel extremely cheated after purchasing this DVD from Amazon.  I purchased volume 1 and it included 2 discs...Disc 1 and Disc 6.  Needless to say, after completing the first disc, I had no clue as to what was happening in Disc #6. Whoever packaged this disc set needs to be more attentive.  The first disc was phenomenal....the acting, story line and the editing were great.  You actually get full episodes and can follow what was happening. This usually does not happen with the other telenovelas that I have purchased in the past.
My final review is this: Kate del Castillo and La Reina del Sur- 5 stars; Amazon- 1 star.",1444867200,,688,4.652892561983471

4681130,5,B005FJQBZO,"Telemundo, please release the Reina del Sur videos with either Spanish and/or English subtitles. Having reviewed the other posts, we and other non-native Spanish-speaking viewers will pay it. My husband and I read the Arturo Perez Reverte novel when it was first released and we own the novel in both English and Spanish (on Kindle and paperback). We are native English speakers who get by in Spanish.  When we learned that Reina Del Sur had been released as a wildly popular Telenovela, we promptly purchased both volumes of the video set.  Since we've read the book, we enjoy the video series immensely, but the colloquial Spanish is so rapid fire that often it is very difficult to follow.  This sentiment echoes many other posts.  Now to the real review:  This is a fabulous action packed high quality production with outstanding performances by Kate del Castillo and Cristina Urgel and many others. For any non-native Spanish speaker even semi-proficient in understanding Spanish, we do recommend these videos, but probably only if you've read the book first and are patient about not understanding all the dialogue as the action plays out. .",1438992000,2,1147,5.015789473684211
4681131,3,B005FJQBZO,"La Reina del Sur (The Queen of the South) is the story of Teresa Mendoza (Kate del Castillo, 38 at the time of filming), a 23-year-old woman who is living with her boyfriend, ""El Gero"" (Rafael Amaya), a rising star in the Sinaloa drug cartel. Unbeknownst to Mendoza, El Gero was really a DEA agent. Once exposed, he was killed on the order of Epifanio Vargas (Humberto Zurita), the leader of the cartel. Teresa receives a phone call from an anonymous person telling her to run. Teresa is unaware that El Gero's death was ordered by Vargas, mistakenly believing that he was killed by rivals in the organization. She trades El Gero's business ledger to Vargas in exchange for his help her to flee the country.

La Reina del Sur is an eminently enjoyable but (as another reviewer noted, below) ""cheesy"" soap opera with fight scenes straight out of the 1950s when actors telegraphed punches and turned their heads even before fists arrived at their faces and plot twists so predictable you will see them coming from a mile away.

Nevertheless Kate del Castillo is a charismatic and compelling actress, as are many of the supporting cast, including Alberto Jimnez, a Russian crime boss who becomes Teresa's business partner after her release from jail and Cristina Urgel, a celebrity ""it"" girl from a wealthy Spanish family who captivates the screen with her wild drunken, bisexual exploits. And the dialog is clever and occasionally compelling. What's more, this soap opera is notable for not being politically correct: stereotypes abound and the lead actress continued to smoke and drink heavily throughout her pregnancy.

La Reina del Sur is an entertaining and captivating telenovela. But, let's be clear, it is no ""The Wire"" or ""Breaking Bad.""",1437264000,,1743,4.9419795221843

4681188,5,B005FJQBZO,"Currently, I am learning Spanish, and wanted to have some movies or something to watch. This whole series was extremely affordable at Walmart, I paid less than $30 for parts 1 and 2. I am nearly finished with part 1 and am completely engulfed in it! My Spanish is at a very low, basic level, but I am able to follow the story regardless. I only understand a very small portion of conversations here and there, but it is still understandable with situations and body language. I would certainly fork out more money if I could get it in subtitles (English or Spanish), but I must say, even if you are at a very basic speaking level, do not pass this show up. To do so is folly. I plan on watching the whole series a few times. I am so glad I happened upon this. If you are a novela fan, please, por favor! let me know what else I should buy!

It is very complete and not edited at all from the broadcast. In the 20 hours or so you get to know the characters well. They are like real people in the sense that there are things about them that you both like and dislike (even some of the bad guys).

4681252,5,B005FJQBZO,"I agree with everyone else that the fact they included the entire novela, uncut, in these two dvd sets (6 dvds each) at a great price, is terrific!  Yes, there are no subtitles, but my Spanish is good enough now not to need them.  The main thing I want to add is that this sets looks excellent on my wide screen HDTV.  No, it's not blu ray, but it's the best looking dvd of any telenovela to date.  The picture is 16:9, so it fills the screen, it's very sharp, and the sound is also really good.  I've now finished watching all 63 episodes (took a few months), and all I can say is WOW!",1329609600,,586,4.060869565217391

8470133,1,B005FJQBZO,"If you are a fan of the type of entertainment traditionally labeled/marketed as a ""telenovela,"" then this is your type of show, and you could very well enjoy it. However, I started out as a fan of Arturo Perez-Riverte's original novel, and I only discovered this show when it was suggested in a review of the current American TV version now being broadcast by USA. I was a bit disappointed in that one, and, having come to love the novel as it was written by a Spanish author, I thought that perhaps this might be a closer version. Uh....no. I watched the first episode, and I spent most of it laughing more than I did at Kate del Castillo's episode of the sitcom Telenovela! I've seen her in a couple of shows that had ok performances, but this wasn't one of them. It seemed more like she was delivering a load of yesterday's bad burritos in her pants rather than a dear friend to the afterlife in the wake of the drug-related murders launching the action; she was more convincing playing the wailing La Llorona on Grimm! Teresa Mendoza/Perez-Reverte posit that novels are uniquely able to capture the truth of the human condition, as well as engage and illuminate readers in ways that passively watching television shows and movies simply cannot accomplish. In this case, the book is certainly better, and rereading it is a better way to enjoy it!",1471737600,,1349,4.625
