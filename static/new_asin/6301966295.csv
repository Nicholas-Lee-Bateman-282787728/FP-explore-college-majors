383759,4,6301966295,"This is a neat movie based on Curt Siodmak's novel about Dr. Pat Cory (Lew Ayers), his assistant Dr. Frank Shratt (Gene Evans), and his wife Jan (Nancy Davis, who would later become First Lady, Nancy Reagan) experimenting on a monkey's brain, trying to keep it alive on its own, when an airplane crash happens near by. Requiring the doctor's assistance, he uses his house to perform an operation on the only survivor, the multi-millionaire Warren Donovan.
This fails, but Cory hits upon the idea of using Donovan's brain for his experiments, with some unexpected results.
This isn't a gory movie by any means, but it is very effective with good performances all around.
The print that was used for the DVD is very clear and detailed, which sometimes shows the movie's shortcomings (some inferior stock footage for a car crash sequence and a poorly ""matted"" rain shot).
This budget DVD comes with a theatrical trailer and is closed captioned. If you're a sci-fi fan, I highly recommend it.",991526400,29,988,4.85207100591716

383961,2,6301966295,"Donovans Brain is the story of Dr. Patrick Cory (Lew Ayres, All Quiet on the Western Front) and a scientific experiment gone terribly wrong. We first see Dr. Cory experimenting with a monkeys brain. His wife, Janice (Nancy Davis, later Nancy Reagan) wonders whether they could not surgically remove the brain and keep it alive in a container filled with saline solution and electricity.

Later, the doctor learns of a crashed plane belonging to businessman William Donovan. Donovan, seriously injured, is brought to Corys home. The doctor, assessing that Donovan cannot be saved, removes his brain and places it in a similar solution fed with electricity. The brain survives, but soon demonstrates unforeseen telepathic ability. Rather than being intent on world domination or pure evil, Donovan initially uses his power to get Cory to do his bidding to conduct business as usual. Its established that Donovan, in life, was successful in business but not very empathetic.

The idea of telepathy to control others is a neat plot device but its explored so sluggishly here that its full potential is never realized. What begins as a fascinating science-fiction concept turns out to look pretty silly as Cory and Janice try to figure how to put an end to the brains dominance. The problem is that too much exposition is presented, which is always the downfall of fantasy films. The more that the screenwriter explains, the more the viewer can see flaws. The image of a disembodied brain causing havoc simply doesnt compare with a Frankenstein monster, a Dracula, or even a zombie for visual impact.

Bonus features on the newly restored Blu-ray release include audio commentary by film historian Richard Harland Smith, Trailers From Hell with Joe Dante, and the original theatrical trailer.",1458604800,,1787,5.113013698630137

384083,4,6301966295,"Good version of the Siodmak's novel. Prior to this film, the 1940's version, inappropriately named ""Lady & The Monster"", and starring Richard Arlen and Erich Von Stroheim with Vera Ralston along for the ride, took many liberties with the source material. This one, with Lew Ayres, was somewhat truer to the original novel. The older version was more atmospheric(i.e. castle in the Arizona desert, and Von Stroheim looking menacingly) but this film was higher on action and plot. Ayers does a very good job with his role and seems more like a tycoon than Arlen. Nancy Davis and Gene Evans are both well cast as the Ayers understanding wife and assistant respectively. Look for an appearance of Daily Planet's editor, Perry White (John Hamilton) as a bank official.

384084,4,6301966295,"If your a horror mystery fan you probably know Curt Soidmak was a great writer for many years writing many of the classic horror and mystery
movies. This movie was made from a story by him. Much like a long Twilight Zone episode more than horror or sci fi movie. Lew Ayers was
one of those great character actors you see in many films. He stars in one of the best mystery horror movies Fingers at the Window. This movie
is of course well written and acted but there is no horror blood gore here. It's the story of a man who uses another man's brain to do research
and it takes over his mind. I think it was done much better with Stanley Ridges in The Phantom Speaks which is almost the same as Universal's
Black Friday. So if you like both of those and shows like Twilight Zone you will like this version but I prefer the other two similar movies.",1454198400,,847,4.2024539877300615

Poor Donovan almost gets his way with them, but is finished off at the last possible moment allowing Doctor Cory and his wifey to reconcile (hope he does as well with the Medical Ethics board he is about to face at the end of the movie).

Makes you long for the days when doctors kept an active neurosurgical suite in their country homes and had nothing to do but fiddle with monkey brains (along with their alcoholic sidekicks).

As much fun as it is to watch the movie, it is also fun to recognize some your favorite old-timy actors such as Nancy Reagan, Gene Evans, and Lew Ayres.

Dr. Patrick J. Cory being unethical gets an opportunity to put Tom Donovan's brain in a fish tank with electrodes.  But as we all know man is not supposed to be dallying in God's realm.  He even dabbles in telepathy.  So too did 50s genre Donovan's brain has an expanding experience of which nothing good can come.  So can Donovan be stopped or will he build a monument to his perpetuity?

Yes this is been done better and it may have a striking similarity to Frankenstein.  At one point even feel like Dr. Patrick is going to say ""it is alive!""  Yet you will end up being absorbed in the story and sorry to see it end.

But wait you do not have to.  You can read Curt Siodmak's novel of the same name.

384274,4,6301966295,"A big time millionaire named Warren Donovan(they call him ""Mellow Yellow"") is the only survivor of a very bad plane crash.  Lucky for him, the crash was only minutes away from the home of Dr. Cory, who happens to be performing wacky brain experiments on monkeys.  Donovan's body dies, but Cory, with the help of his drunken assistant, Frank, and his wife, Jan, manage to keep his brain alive in what looks like an aquarium filled with dirty dishwater.  The brain soon establishes a telepathic link with Cory, and slowly begins to possess his body.  Donovan uses Cory's body to take care of his lingering financial affairs and plot to get even more money.  Soon, he becomes dangerous, taking out all those who pose a threat to him, especially a nosy, blackmailing reporter. The brain continues to grow and PULSATE, and become more powerful, but Jan and Frank step in to save the day.
It's the typical 50s science gone mad thing here, and if you like that kind of thing, it's actually a bit above average.  Aside from shots of the brain, there's really nothing in the way of special effects here.  This movie is very dialogue driven, but not boring if you ask me.  I did get a bit frustrated because all of the characters can see what a bad situation this is with the brain, yet no one bothers to do anything about it until the brain has become too powerful.  You just wanna scream at the characters to throw the damn brain out the window and end this nonsense!  Granted, the movie would be awfully short then.

384276,3,6301966295,"""Donovan's Brain"" combines neurosurgery and telepathy to compete with the other sci fi and horror films that were popular in the mid 20th Century. Brain surgery had long been a staple of horror literature, dating from the wildly successful ""Frankenstein"" (1818) by Mary Shelley. Frankenstein was made as a film as early as 1910 by Edison and most famously by James Whale in 1931 with Boris Karloff as ""the creature"". Several Frankenstein sequels followed in the next few years.

Telepathy also has a long history, and appeared in films as early as 1920 in ""The Golem"" by German expressionist Paul Wegener, based on the 1914 novel of the same name. ""Mind control"" was also a prominent feature of ""Dracula"" (1931).

The 1942 novel from Curt Siodmak (1902-2000) combined brain surgery and telepathy or mind control, to give us a disembodied brain that takes control of a physician. Siodmak was the younger brother of film noir director Robert Siodmak. He was a Polish Jew whose life was turned upside down when the Nazis took over in Germany, and he emigrated to the U.S. This experience created a great concern for issue of change and control. He wrote the screenplays for ""The Invisible Man Returns"" (1940), ""The Invisible Woman"" (1940), ""The Ape"" (1940) and then ""The Wolf Man"" (1941) which can all be looked at as a metaphor for his experiences watching the German people transformed from good people into monsters. Then his novel, ""Donovan's Brain"", was a further examination of this process, mirroring the way in which Goebbels as a brain controlled the body of the German people.

Siodmak's novel was turned into a film as early as 1944 (""The Lady and the Monster""), followed by this film, and again in 1962 (""The Brain""). Orson Welles played the part of the physician in the 1944 radio broadcast.

Lew Ayres (1908-96) stars as a physician who tries to preserve the brain of a multimillionaire, only to find the brain taking control of his behavior.  Ayres' performance in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930) propelled him to early stardom. That's the good news. But the horrors of war remained with him, so when WW 2 came around, he refused to serve in a combat position and instead enrolled in the medical corps. But an ultrapatriotic Hollywood took this as a sign of cowardice (never mind that Wayne, Flynn, etc didn't serve at all), and his Hollywood career would never be the same. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Johnny Belinda"" (1948) and for an Emmy for a guest appearance on ""Kung Fu"" (1972). He's probably best known from his portrayal as Dr. Kildare in a series of 40s films.

Nancy Davis (1921) is best known as Ronald Reagan's last wife. She was active in films from the 50s then transitioned to TV and retired in 1962. None of her dozen film roles were distinguished. In this one she plays Ayres' devoted wife.

Gene Evans (1922-98) plays against type as Ayres' colleague. Big gruff Evans usually played a heavy in westerns and war films, often called ""Red"" due to his hair color. He's best known for his role as the father on ""My Friend Flicka"" (1955-8).

Steve Brodie (1919-92) plays a blackmailing reporter. Brodie made more than 100 films between 1944 and 1988.

Felix Feist (1910-65) directs, although writer Siodmak was originally slated. He made a few dozen undistinguished films between 1932 and 1955, then transitioned to TV where he was active in westerns and sci fi (""Outer Limits"", ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"").

1953 was a good year for film. The top grossing films were ""Peter Pan"", ""The Robe"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""Shane"", and ""How to Marry a Millionaire"". The big Oscar winner was ""From Here to Eternity"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor and Actress). Other notable films that year were ""Stalag 17"", ""The Wild One"", ""Titanic"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""The Desert Rats"", and ""Niagara"". The ""House of Wax"" was #20 at the box office and sci fi classics like ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" and ""It Came from Outer Space"" appeared.

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said ""Mr. Feist's little exercise in science-fiction is a limpid and artificial thing"" and called the film ""utterly silly"" although he had praise for Ayres' performance.

Donovan's Brain would influence subsequent films about telepathic control, including ""The Man Without a Body"" (1957), ""The Brain Eaters"" (1958), ""The Thing That Couldn't Die"" (1958), and ""Horrors of the Black Museum"" (1959).

If you're a fan of 50s sci fi, this film will appeal to you. The acting is good even if the science is bad.",1312243200,6,4512,4.8441558441558445

384278,5,6301966295,"This movie is a masterpiece of prophetic genius. Nancy Davies (later first lady as nancy Reagan)dominates this movie with her opaque, universally middle class presence. Her hunched shoulders, blank expression and obsessively de-sexualized clothing make her the closest image of an American secular nun ever to come on the screen. It is absolutely impossible to imagine her anywhere near a sexual situation in these clothes and the neurotic control of every detail of her make up and outfits is a preview of her image control skills that would so well serve the Reagan administration in projecting a restrained yet efficient pseudo-Imperial elegance.

In this movie she is the wife of a scientist who is charting new ground by keeping a human brain alive after the body has died in an accident. The brain eventually takes over his own will, and I must say that the evil, selfish tax-cheating millionaire is a much more attractive figure than the sappy doctor she married. Although it also, accidentally, points out the profiling that corporate American wealth has taken in our own time.

The great and unexpected bonus for watching this film is in seeing the character traits that made Nancy such a great presence in the White House of Reagan's reign. Her demeanor was irreproachably correct, yet her manipulative character could not help but control everything under a sweet, perfect smile. This was a premonition of the much bigger role real life awarded her years later, when she finally had control of a powerful man with limited brain power. The reward did not come as an Oscar for roles of these nature, which were pretty much her career, but in the theater of international politics where she joined the company of other B actresses that switched to politics and excelled beyond their wildest dreams: Evita and Mme Mao Tse Tung.

Cory's been keeping the little simian brain ""alive"" in a tank of icky water by sticking electrodes into it. Now, with the help of his wife Jan (Nancy Davis) and a fellow doctor (Gene Evans), Cory tosses out the monkey brain, replacing it with Donovan's gray matter! The brain is successfully saved, floating peacefully in it's new aquarium habitat, when shockingly, it begins pulsating, glowing eerily, and growing to the size of a wrinkly, 20-pound ham! Cory is possessed by W.H. Donovan's mind, and begins flying all over the country, closing out bank accounts, blackmailing politicians, killing nosey, blackmailing reporters; and getting his (Donovan's) life in order. Back at the lab, Jan is hurriedly trying to concoct a way to help her husband get un-Donovanized. Will she succeed, or will the devilish Donovan destroy her marriage along with everyone in his path? DONOVAN'S BRAIN is classic cerebral sci-fi at it's best...",1111363200,10,1343,5.026905829596412

384344,4,6301966295,"Let's face it, brains are gross...they're gray, wrinkly, gelatinous, and usually covered with viscous fluids.  Sure, some monsters find them rather tasty, but I think most of us would, at the very least, wince with disgust at the thought of handling a brain, that is unless you're some kind of medical professional specializing in brains, a creepy scientist with a hankering to tinker in the realm of the unknown, or just a sickie with a with an unnatural urge to mess around with disgusting things.  Regardless, Hollywood has found disembodied brains to be a worthwhile subject for at least a few films from The Brain from Planet Arous (1957), Fiend Without a Face (1958), The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962) (okay, this one features a disembodied head rather than a disembodied brain, but either way, it's a real stinker), The Brain (1964), The Man With Two Brains (1983), and this film, Donovan's Brain (1953).  Of the sub genre, Donovan's Brain isn't the best, but certainly isn't the worst.

The film, based on a novel written by the prolific and influential Curt Siodmak (fans of early horror and sci-fi films will recognize the name) and directed by Felix Fiest, Donovan's Brain features Lew Ayres (calling Dr. Kildare...) as Dr. Patrick Corey, a scientist obsessed with unlocking the mysteries of the brain.  The film also stars Nancy Davis (future First Lady Nancy Reagan and the woman who taught a whole generation how to `Just Say No') as his wife Janice, and veteran actor Gene Evans, who I last saw in the Steven McQueen western Nevada Smith (1966), as Dr. Frank Schratt, a local practitioner, part-time assistant to Dr. Corey, and a part-time alcoholic (his first scene in the film has him passed out on the floor).

The film begins with Dr. Corey and his wife returning from a trip to the local monkey store with a new specimen for Corey's experiments (don't get too attached to that monkey, Janice), that involve, you guessed it, brains...it seems Corey is intent on proving a brain, hooked to electrodes, can survive in a fish tank with dirty water, long after the host body is gone.  Why, you ask?  Why not, I say...well, after numerous failed attempts, this last one succeeds, and not a moment too soon as Dr. Corey is about to upgrade from monkey brains to human brains.  It seems there's been a small plane crash in the area, and since Dr. Schratt is nowhere to be found (he's actually sleeping one off, if you know what I mean...glugg, glugg...), Dr. Corey is called in to tend to possible survivors.  Apparently there's only one, a man named W.H. Donovan.  Who is W.H. Donovan?  Well, I tell you...he's an extremely rich man who possesses a very dark side, as we learn later on in the film.  Anyway, attempts to save Donovan, who's very badly hurt, fail, Corey sees an opportunity in harvesting the dead man's brain.  With the help of his wife and Dr. Schratt, they manage to not only save the Donovan's brain, but keep it alive...and soon it begins to grow (with a lot of pulsating and glowing involved), and become strong.  So strong, in fact, it begins to psychically force its' will on Corey (primarily) and the others.  In becoming aware of his predicament and his new found powers, Donovan see possibilities he never before imagined, and plans begin to formulate.  What kind of monstrosity has been unleashed on the world?  Can it be stopped?  Perhaps, but at what cost?

I will say I enjoyed this film a lot.  It's odd as the film is listed as sci-fi/horror, but it had an underlying `noir' quality, specifically the scenes where Donovan has taken over Corey's body, and is arranging his affairs, dealing with those who think him dead.  He's a real meany, compared to congenial Corey who's obsessed but with the best intentions (saving lives, dammit!), to put it simply, and Aryes does a remarkable job switching personalities from Corey to Donovan.  It's definitely a Jekyll and Hyde situation, and obvious enough for those who know Corey and have knowledge of the experiment understand what is happening.  The direction is very good, and the use of shadows fairly pronounced, eliciting the `noir' quality I spoke of before.  The plot is strong, and moves along at a good pace, allowing for little wasted screen time during the 84 minutes running time of the film.  There are melodramatic elements included, involving concern for the change taking place with Dr. Corey, and given my limited experience with Siodmak's work, I feel this adaptation stays close to the original material.  The effect is meant to infuse meaning and purpose to the characters, effectively turning them from 2-dimensional images on the screen to 3-dimensional characters the audience cares about, something that tends to be missing in a lot of modern day horror films, in my opinion.  The special effects are pretty good (you will believe that pulsating brain lives) and enhance the story nicely.  I wasn't too impressed with Nancy Davis' performance, but I couldn't decide if it was her acting, the inclusion of her character just because the story called for a female actress, or some of her lame lines (her character seemed resigned to state the obvious and provide little bits of exposition throughout, along with suffering a slight tinge of misogyny not uncommon in films of the time).

The film is presented in its' original format (full screen), and looks very sharp, although I did notice some minor speckling throughout, but nothing to get in a bind over (the scenes featuring the stock footage car crash are the worst, showing very noticeable damage).  The only special feature is that of a theatrical trailer, but I really wasn't expecting much since this comes from MGM Midnight Movie series, which isn't known for its' inclusion of extras, but can be counted on to provide a good looking transfer.

384345,5,6301966295,Heres one that just gets better with time. I saw this movie years ago and ordered it with just a vague memory of the theme. Wow! The former first lady has her hands full fighting for her husbands life. The brain grows stronger and more deadly as the movie progresses. MGM Midnight movies are fast becoming my favorite source for classic sci-fi. The price being right is one reason and the other is the high quality of picture and sound. A must see for any fan of sci-fi from the golden age. This review is for the DVD!,1039651200,4,518,4.295918367346939
384346,4,6301966295,"There is something grotesquely ironic about seeing former First Lady Nancy Regan as the caretaker of a disembodied brain bent on world conquest--but at the time the movie first appeared the great irony in casting concerned actor Lew Ayres, who was best remembered as for his screen series as the respectable and responsible Dr. Kildaire, and who here plays a mad scientist.  One way or another, cult-film enthusiasts will have tremendous fun with this one.  But even so, DONOVAN'S BRAIN has a lot more going for it than cult-film appeal: the story line continues to resonate in the modern era of medical ethics issues, the script is surprisingly intelligent, and the director and actors play it out at a snappy pace.

Based on a successful novel, DONOVAN'S BRAIN concerns a scientist (Ayers) who is experimenting with keeping monkey brains alive in tanks--and when a nearby plane crash lands a terminal accident victim on his surgery table he presses his wife (Nancy Davis, later Regan) and surgical sidekick (Gene Evans) into recovering a human brain for his work.  And he succeeds beyond all expection.  Trouble is, the brain belongs to a truly evil multi-millionaire who wants to take over the world, and under Ayres care the brain grows... and begins to exert an unexpectedly nasty psychic influence on those around it.

Ayres was a gifted leading man whose credits ranged from ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT to JOHNNY BELINDA, and the film owes much of its success to his talents; Gene Evans is also quite good as the drunken surgeon Ayres befriends.  As for Nancy, she is clearly a B-Movie actress, but she is a surprisingly competent one.  Cult fans will have a field day, but the movie is too interesting as a whole to be designated such pure and simple; it has a lot going for it, and just about every one who sees it will have a good time.  Recommended.

Co-star Nancy Davis went on to become First Lady of the United States, selected undoubtedly for her heroic acts against Donovan's malevolent organ.

Lew Ayres and Nancy Reagan (then Nancy Davis, who had just completed working on Hell Cats of the Navy with Ronald Reagan) put in fine performances in a movie that holds our attention for the duration.

7817675,4,6301966295,"This review is for the blu-ray version of Donovan's Brain (1953) released on March 22, 2016 by Kino-Lorber

BLU_RAY DVD: The blu-ray quality is excellent. If you are a fan of this movie and want the best possible picture, this is easily the best version for you.

EXTRA'S: There is a commentary track by film historian Richard Smith. It's pretty informative if not terribly exciting. You also get the original trailer and a ""Trailers from Hell"" presentation from Joe Dante.

PLOT/SUMMARY: The movie starts off with Dr. Patrick Correy (Lew Ayers) and his wife Janice (Nancy Reagan!) experimenting on some animals. The experiments involve keeping alive the animal's brains while outside of the body. They are assisted by the town doctor who is also an alcoholic (Gene Evans).
They hear of a plane crash and the body of a millionaire, Warren H. Donovan, is brought to his laboratory since he is the only doctor nearby. Dr. Correy removes the brain after he realizes that Donovan is a hopeless cause. Donovan's brain somehow exerts his will over Dr. Correy and begins to plan to permanently take over Dr. Correy's body as well as regain all his assets. Donovan's brain can also force his will upon anybody he makes contact with.  A nosy reporter gets wind of what is going on in the lab and attempts to blackmail the doctor. Correy's wife along with friend must figure out how to rest control away from Donovan.

PRODUCTION: 'Donovan's Brain' was a successful novel by Curt Siodmak written in 1942. There have been a few other movies based on this novel. None of them follow the plot completely. This one has a different ending than the novel.
The acting is very good. As far as I'm concerned it borders on excellent for a movie of this type. Lew Ayers was superb as Dr. Correy. Everybody else was above average to excellent as well.

THOUGHTS: Overall I thought this was a pretty good movie despite what some other's think. I enjoyed the parts when Lew Ayers was being controlled by Donovan's brain. I also found it very interesting watching Nancy Davis act. I kept thinking about her speeches as first lady and trying to reconcile the younger and older versions of herself.
As far as 'brain' movies go, this one is definitely one of the best, if not the best.

Thanks to Kino-Lorber for making this available in blu-ray.

Highly Recommended for any 50's sci-fi fans and fans of 'brain' movies!",1470096000,,2391,4.730769230769231

7817678,4,6301966295,"With the help of his drunken assistant (Gene Evans as Dr. Schratt), a cold and callous scientist (Lew Ayres as Dr. Cory) kills another monkey after he removes its brain.  Dr. Cory is obsessed with monkey brains.  When a report of a plane crash comes in and his help is required, Dr. Cory can hardly stand to be parted from his monkey brain.  He has to be talked into providing care to the four passengers in the crashed plane.  Three die, one lives long enough to make it to the doctors mountain lair.  When the last passenger dies, the doctor feels it would be criminal to waste a perfectly good brain, so he takes it and dumps it in a fish tank.  Soon, the insensitive doctor realizes hes met someone even more manipulative than he is..........Donovans brain!!!  Through telepathy, Donovan possesses the mad scientist and gets him to do his every bidding.  Mostly this entails gathering a lot of money Donovan has stashed all over the place, so he can rule the world, one bank at a time!  Unfortunately for the brain, treasury agents and a nosy reporter show up.  The reporter is a blackmailer and the agents want a lot of information the brain doesnt want to give out.  Can anything stop this brain from getting too big for its fish tank!!!

Its wacky, its fun, Lew Ayres gets to play a split personality, and Nancy Davis almost approximates a real person in her depiction of Dr. Corys beleaguered wife.

A fascinating piece of sci-fi horror.  The only downside is the character of Dr. Cory.  He is so indifferent its impossible to feel sorry for him when the brain takes over.  Anyone who can kill monkeys right and left with nary a twinge of conscience............",1466380800,,1669,4.587837837837838
