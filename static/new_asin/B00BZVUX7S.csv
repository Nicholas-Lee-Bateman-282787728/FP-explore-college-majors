5683224,5,B00BZVUX7S,"My Review:

 Join this Kung Fu adventure when a group of very clever personalities also known as the students of the Tiger Academy, as they fearlessly defeat Master Sifu's mortal enemy, Slash. Slash is out to obtain a tablet that he hopes will give him the world at his fingertips. All seems to be lost until Fu, a talented chef and not to mention rabbit, steps into the picture. Fu was lucky enough to receive all of Master Sifu's Kung Fu Mastery and power upon his death. Will the transfer of his powers onto Fu the rabbit be enough to save the Kung Fu Academy as well as the world?

 Legend of Kung Fu Rabbit is a delightful children's movie that my boys enjoyed. They love anything full of action and this movie fit the bill. The movie is 89 minutes in length so it kept us all entertained and it is a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. Upon watching the movie, I started hearing familiar voices such as Tom Arnold (Master Sifu) and John Heder does a great job as the voice of Fu the rabbit. Last but not least Michael Clarke Duncan as Slash.  Fu is a nice, sweet unassuming rabbit that steps in to save the day and save it he does.

Legend of Kung Fu Rabbit is a fun movie that I'm sure your children will enjoy. It is also a Dove Foundation approved movie so you don't have to worry about the language or the action scenes. Legend of Kung Fu Rabbit will be released on DVD, Digital Download and Video on Demand September 24 for the suggested retail price of $19.98.

5683225,4,B00BZVUX7S,"This is not a bad film but compared to Kung Fu Panda, a major studio production, it's very crude.  I enjoyed it for the simple character and story and kung fu lessons.",1375315200,,167,4.21875
5683226,5,B00BZVUX7S,"The feel is a lot like Kung Fu Panda with the ancient chinese landscapes, etc. But the dialog is not as high quality, and was probably written by a teenager. There are more ""complicated"" dialogs in other animated movies nowadays, but they are boring to my kids, and to me also. This movie is definitely high on the fun and entertaining factor. I rented it for one day and ended up buying a copy.",1374710400,2,395,4.351351351351352
5683227,3,B00BZVUX7S,"The quality of this movie is lacking, and yet it does have some great lessons that can be extracted from the story worth learning and imparting, after all, everything is kung fu really... It is worth a watch for entertainment's sake alone too. The rabbit hero, Fu is not stupid, he's simple, and it is his simple ways that lead to his greatness.",1365379200,,345,4.492063492063492
5683228,1,B00BZVUX7S,"Rented this movie today, and was ready to turn it off after the first five minutes.  Don't let the title or and description fool you, this is not a continuation of the Kung Fu Panda series.  It seems almost like this one was made in China and re-voiced for the US.  The voices are annoying.  The rabbit is beyond dumb.  Save your money and time and avoid this one.",1363996800,3,364,4.217391304347826

8575959,1,B00BZVUX7S,"Sadly this movie had a bit of nice artistry as far as the buildings, but the characters often mistreat and disrespect each other and the main character was portrayed as totally empty or very occasionally extremely adept at fixing a situation, but not often enough. How can a movie make characters so extreme, even for a cartoon? Really sad and really not worth showing to children as the ethics are horrible, especially the with the behavior of the main child character who is one of the most disrespectful of the cast.",1439424000,,519,4.714285714285714
8575960,1,B00BZVUX7S,"Terrible. You could barely understand half the dialog - the main character was the worst, it was like Jon Heder had a mouthful of marbles. Story line was hard to follow, made no sense half the time.  Really bad rip off of Kung Fu Panda.  Honestly it was painful to watch, but funny at the same time because it was sooo bad.",1438473600,,323,4.193548387096774

8575962,2,B00BZVUX7S,"They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and were you to read the summary of 2011s Kung Fu Rabbit, youd be convinced DreamWorks should be very flattered indeed.  The story tells of a a portly and dumpy rabbit named Fu who makes a living in the restaurateur sector (making sweet cakes), who inadvertently gets swept up in the world of Kung Fu mastery when a true master (Shifu no less) passes on his skills and knowledge after a fatal assault.  Oh and if all of this weren't enough to make you think youd accidentally stumbled upon a summation of Kung Fu Panda with a few typos, perhaps youd be interested to discover that the bad guy is in fact a large panda in need of a good stomping.  A nice tag-line for this film could well have been, Take That Katzenberg.

Of course with its budget of roughly 12-mil and a 2013 direct-to-dvd release here in the States by Lions Gate that pretty much failed to register so much as a blip on the populations collective radar, its pretty safe to say Jeffery Katzenberg and the rest of DreamWorks didn't lose too much sleep over the concept of lost revenue to Kung Fu Rabbit.

It should be noted however that the production caused a bit more of a stir abroad, having been produced in China and playing on the slant of better cultural authenticity and more spectacular martial arts than the Panda film from the US, Kung Fu Rabbit actually earned itself a theatrical run in several markets abroad including both Asian and European.

Interestingly, and what is apparently commonplace, when dubbed into English, not only did the film receive a new cast but many editorial changes as well, apparent when looking at a translation even of things as simple as the characters names.  Master Shifu here in the American version is known only as Master in the original script (as apparently shifu is synonymous with master, meaning Master Shifu of Kung Fu Panda fame would in fact be akin to saying Master Master), lead character Fu was in fact Tu, and daughter Penny here was Peony in the original and led to a long running shtick where Tu mistakenly believes her name to be Pony.  Even the title, here Kung Fu Rabbit is the more original Legend of a Rabbit in its native release.  This is relevant simply because one can only hope that a lot of the blatant Kung Fu Panda rip-offs were more the result of American marketing looking to cash-in on the fact that a lot of consumers just skim the covers and back descriptions of animated DVDs and blus before making a rental or purchase rather than a Chinese film companys legit offensive against a beloved global franchise.

Beijing Film Academy and Tianjin Film Studio are the groups responsible for this film, which comes in a run time of 89-minutes and wears a PG rating due to some questionable language and animated violence and weaponry.

I suppose all of this is fine and well but doesnt do much to explain what watching the film itself is like and to that there is a single word that does a nice job covering it: Drab.  The visuals are pretty decent, environments rich and characters nicely detailed but the story feels an awful lot like Kung Fu Panda stripped of just about everything that made the franchise so endearing.  While Po was never in danger of nomination into Mensa, he is a mastermind when compared to Fu (voiced earnestly by genuine funny guy John Heder).  Many of the gags concerning his low IQ and clumsiness stretch on for entirely too long and make suspension of disbelieve all but impossible.  Shifu has to show up into Fus dreams literally twice just to make him understand that he's been given the gift of Kung Fu despite his having explained it when the transfer initially took place and the skills literally manifesting within him as the movie goes on.

The remainder of the characters face a similar fate, the only real depth coming in the form of the short-lived Shifu (Tom Arnold); who actually manages to appear wise and kind without resorting to cliche Confucius Say style accenting.

About the only area the piece succeeds is through a couple of well choreographed Kung Fu fight sequences (and, believe it or not, a few instances of Fu preparing food).  Other wise the film is rife with slow pacing, minimal character motivation and cliches aplenty.  The character models are literally cut & paste from the Kung Fu Panda school of art and just shuffled around in the hopes that playing different roles may confuse potentially viewers to the lack of originality:  This time the master is the monkey, the bad guy the panda, Tigress has a clone, well two of them as they happen to be twins.  The bad guy minions are oxen, pigs and so on.  I didn't spot an equivalent to Mantis in this one but perhaps I simply didn't study the backgrounds hard enough.

All in all, the end result (despite how it may seem in reading this) doesnt quite feel as Kung Fu Panda-ripped-off as expected though that isn't to suggest it is good by default as a result either.  What is here is an hour and a half of substandard plotting, average visuals and some sequences that drag on to the point of tedium.  Look into this one only if youve watched both Panda films, all of the holiday specials, and the entire Legends of Awesomeness animated television series and find you still crave some anthropomorphic animals performing Kung Fu in ancient China.  And even then it would be wise to go in with low expectations.",1417132800,,5411,4.610416666666667
8575963,2,B00BZVUX7S,"Rumor has it that some Chinese company thought ""Why the heck did Kung Fu Panda not come from China?  That's OUR culture!  Also, isn't it humiliating to have our national animal portrayed as a silly fat thing?"" and so made this movie.

Curious, I bought it.

Well, they've got a ""badass"" godfather thug panda, and a big fat goofy ""kung-fu rabbit"".

Unfortunately, most of the main characters (especially the fat ""kung-fu rabbit"") and ALL of the side characters, are voiced by goofy doofs who seem to be channeling Mister Bill.

This is almost bad enough to be good.

Addendum:  The only audio track is English.  This was originally written in Chinese and translated into English (it's impossible not to notice this) but we do not have the privilege of listening to it in anything but English.

This is a shame, because whichever Napoleon Dynamite doof acted as the main rabbit?  He should have been fired on day two.  And possibly sued. I wouldn't let him do the voice of Scooby Doo.",1417046400,,982,4.678362573099415
8575964,5,B00BZVUX7S,"Most kids movies now are geared toward adults,...this actually is quite brilliant in it's simplicity and story,...because,..what do you know, kids LOVE it and they understand it and watch the WHOLE thing!. Shocking. Lol. The only people I've heard not liking it are a few adults who are obviously used to the movies for kids that are really for adults, and bore kids to tears or go right over their heads.
Many kids I've known have loved it so much they watch it over and over,...and as most parents know, that's the sign of a successful kids movie. And it has some wonderful lessons for children,...and some very funny parts. All in all- a definite find.",1390089600,,655,4.655172413793103
8575965,3,B00BZVUX7S,"I lucked out and watched this one morning with my little one on Netflix - glad I didn't pay full retail. At first I thought it was a total rip off of Kung Fu Panda. Lots of the same themes and backgrounds. Bunnies, pandas, pigs, monkey...etc. The plot is different. Fu is granted Kung fu through this chi energy transfer, unlike Po who is driven by his unknown adopted past and his love of Kung fu. Fu is simple while Po is more complex. Shifu here is also simpler, we don't quite get as much backstory. Penny is similar to Tigress, but is driven more by revenge in this story.

So Summary: Fu=Po, Shifu=Shifu, Penny=Tigress, Slash=Tilung, Tablet=DragonScroll.

Creative math substitution: Tilung attacks Shifu for the dragon scroll. Shifu escapes. Shifu dies and gives Po the dragon scroll, he's told to find tigress because she is intended to have the dragon scroll. Tigress finds out Shifu is dead and wants revenge. Po finds Tigress. Tilung is defeated and Po gives Tigress the Dragon Scroll.

So is it a ripoff? You be the judge. I enjoyed the movie enough. And my little one was there for 75% of it.",1389484800,,1105,4.598984771573604
8575966,3,B00BZVUX7S,"The sad fact was that this movie could have done so much better. The very first thing that peeved me off was just the simple fact that in the English version all the character's names were changed. Tu'er became Fu, MoYan/MoLi became Penny/Penelope, LaoGuanZhu -the monkey master and a very large part of the film- was technically unnamed when you think about it, and the 'panda' XiongTianBa became Slash. You've got to be kidding me! The voice acting and script were atrocious, and a lot of it got 'lost in translation.' For example: the two thieves Tu meets on his way to the imperial city were made to be covering themselves in black paint to look scary/unique in the english version. In the original chinese dialogue they were covering themselves in oil in order to sneak into a person's home to rob them before Tu inadvertently interrupted them.
I really didn't care for the fact that this was too much like a Kung Fu Panda ripoff. It honestly doesn't bother me. The director, Sun Yijun, stated that he had no intention to do so and honestly didn't know what those acquisitions were about. The reason I don't believe this is because of the vast similarities between the two. For one, Po and Tu's fighting style are extremely similar -being impervious to direct attacks because of their 'fat.' Both Shifu's 'daughters' were not only not biologically related -red panda/tiger and monkey/cat- but were both kung fu masters who were not the heroes in the end, but rather stepping stones for the real hero. Also, this movie reminded me of a 'Legends of Awesomeness' special called 'Enter the Dragon' involving something called the Hero's Ki -or Chi, however you want to spell it.
I could go on and on about the similarities but anyone who has seen the two movies will know it for themselves without being told. Just put simply, if things had been done differently this could have been a decent movie overlooking the fact that it was a ripoff. I feel badly for the english voice actors who had to lend themselves for this. At least Michael Duncan had a decent role...",1385769600,,2065,4.691460055096419
