469319,5,6302484286,"This is one of those miraculous surpises in life. Each of the women in the movie presents their real lives and spirits in the fictional setting of a bus broken down 20 miles from civilization. They spend three days surrounded by the most beautiful scenery possible, exposing their humanity to each other and to the audience. It's the kind of movie and story that makes you happy to be alive, even while it forces you to confront your mortality. It also serves as a gentle reminder that every person you meet has a rich and nuanced personal history. No one can be simply judged and ignored, as our normally hectic lives might pressure us to do.",1008288000,7,643,4.551724137931035
469320,5,6302484286,"I have always found the lives of women to be more interesting than that of  men. They are emotionally stronger, have more depth and can make the most  ordinary things interesting. And this film confirms my belief. I wish each  of the  women were my personal friend. It's hard to believe they are all  first time actors. They are all so natural. Constance Garneau conveys more  with her silence than any actor I have seen on screen with a million words.  A beautifully made film. Breathtaking photography of the Canadian  countryside, haunting music, superb acting. The film's more like a  documentary. I wish there were more personal information on the Net on each  of the actors, including their addresses so I could write and tell them how  much they have touched my life through this film.  The film helped me  realize that senior citizens are as human as any youth, just as full of  dreams, hopes, and desires.  That within their old bodies lies an ageless,  undying  spirit, with cravings that will match that of any young person.  The film has helped me prepare for my time when I'll  be an ""old  man"".

469322,5,6302484286,"Seven elderly women and their bus driver band together to survive when their bus breaks down in the Quebec countryside.  As they draw closer, the woman begin to share stories from their diverse pasts.  Quietly brilliant and poignant.  END",890524800,3,238,5.051282051282051
469473,5,6302484286,"Here's the sort of quiet, understated film that seldom got made in the past, and is almost never made today -- and more's the pity. When several older Canadian women of various backgrounds get lost & stranded in the country after their bus breaks down, they have to fend for themselves over a couple of days. In the process, they reveal much of their lives, their joys & sorrows, and gradually get to know one another as we get to know them. And that's it, all set against a beautiful Canadian landscape.

It may sound as if nothing much happens ... but it's one of those stories where that ""nothing much"" is nothing less than the stuff of life itself. Making this film even more fascinating is the fact that these women are basically playing themselves, improvising a good deal within the fictional frame of the temporarily stranded bus. So their stories of childhood & youth are their own stories, all punctuated by still photographs of the women earlier in their lives.

This won't be to every taste, of course, and quite understandably so. While it's quite entertaining & engrossing, it's not your usual film entertainment at all. But it is a deeply moving, poignant, and often very funny revelation of the rich emotional depths beneath still & deceptively placid waters. Its astonishing to see just how much is revealed by a single phrase, or a lingering shot of one of their faces. For those who cherish meaningful films, this is one not to be missed -- most highly recommended!",1474243200,,1484,4.703846153846154

469477,4,6302484286,I saw this film on TV maybe 30 years ago and really enjoyed it.  I finally found it on DVD and bought it to share with friends who also enjoyed it very much.,1466899200,,157,3.757575757575758
469478,5,6302484286,"I purchased this DVD a while ago, but in organizing my collection of DVDs recently, I became reacquainted with it. This is a very interesting and somewhat unusual work of art. It is an improv piece set around a particular circumstance: a group of older women plus a young woman (their bus driver) on their way to a seniors event, take a detour to see the childhood home of one of the ladies and ultimately get stuck in the woods when their bus breaks down en route.

The group is an eclectic one, to say the least. There is a nun, a lesbian, a 20-something bus driver, a woman with Native American heritage and several others. When they cant get the bus restarted, they are forced to camp in an abandoned lake house, making do with whatever they can find and forage.

The pace is somewhat slow but thats what makes this so intoxicating. It has an almost documentary/reality feel to it. And I must say that this is a very uplifting film, despite the fact that all of the ladies are now deceased (except the bus driver, played by Michelle Sweeney).

The making do at the abandoned lake house involves setting up for everyone, foraging for household items such as mattresses and pitchers for water and rationing what food they have between them. These women could not be more different from each other but they make it work and they work together, helping each other freely and without any type of prejudice or judgment. The women take the situation in stride and are resourceful as survivalists. In working together, the details of their lives come out, much of which are true bits and pieces from the womens real lives. There are poignant moments  a nun speaking to a young woman about being married to Jesus, women discussing their fear of dying, of being unloved, ill, abandoned, of being grandmothers or a lesbian, and the topics go on and on. This is a study on realities, joys and pains all tied together in what constitutes life.

When their rescue proves to be questionable, the nun goes off into the woods to walk miles in search of help and the others use their wits to get by, making fishing nets out of panty hose, picking berries, entertaining each other and sharing their stories. They do not complain or whine or bicker  they do what they need to do.

There is not much of a plot, but you cant stop watching once you start. Since pulling this out, I have watched it a few times and every time I watch it, I get some new insight or see a new layer of depth I hadnt seen before.

For a film that was released in 1990  26 years ago  that was not a blockbuster, the fact that this is still in print and being sold, says an awful lot about this film.

I have just purchased the accompanying book by Mary Meigs and am almost done reading it. I will post a review for that soon. I don't know why I didn't read it sooner.

But, this is an important film, in my opinion - a must see for all women, young or old.

469568,5,6302484286,"There is no way that anyone will not enjoy this enigmatic film. I saw it when it came out 25 years ago, and thought it was cute, profound, touching and powerful. Now, at 66 years old, I'm in love with every one of those old dolls.

What would you do if you were stuck with a bunch of strangers, your contemporaries, in a somewhat confined setting? Doesn't sound like something I'd encourage, but when you're in the middle of a glorious Canadian countryside, with nature all around you, and an uncertain outcome, it's prudent to overlook the immediate bleak situation and finally take a good look at how beautiful this world...and life...really is.

Each of the girls reflects on their lives, all non-professional actresses, talking about real stuff, and discovering that the most important element in life is understanding, to listen and learn how completely alike we all are. It's not at all unrealistic, under the guidance of director Cynthia Scott, who searched at length to find the oddest assortment of women and throw them together. The result is pure magic, and, though memories can be sad, the saddest part is at the end when they're rescued (no spoiler) and may never see each other again, in this lifetime. The commeraderie has been solid, each woman having a memory of the situation that is lasting.

The DVD I have, by Modern Day Classics, has some background info on the actresses involved. All champions, in my book, and I wish I could give Cissy a huge hug. Each woman in the cast has a very personal agenda, but it seems like Cissy had the hardest life, and is the most consistently cheerful. It's encouraging to know that unlike backgrounds can have so much in common.

This is the ultimate feel good film for me. Ya gotta love 'em.",1435017600,2,1749,4.687296416938111

There is drama, to be sure, revealed in the lives of each character, over the course of the time they spend together while awaiting rescue from their plight. (Broken down bus in the middle of nowhere.) But it's the slower, gentler kind of drama, opening like a fragile flower, and gone just as quickly. In short, I loved it. I particularly enjoyed the resourceful and ever hopeful nun.

Each personality was unique and as the story unfolded their past lives were revealed and added to the pleasure of the plot.

469839,5,6302484286,"This is obviously not a movie for everyone, but it is my kind of film: real people and an interesting take on such a variety of senior women who are stranded in the middle of nowhere. It has no exciting plot nor are they experienced actors.  It is a simple story with diverse women who let us into their private lives...a little, but not really enough. The photos of each when young was a nice touch and the scenery is beautiful...if you like just forests and a lake of which there are long photoshoots and a discussion between two women about watching birds. Some will find this boring, and I do understand why. It is a slow-moving film with no particular aim but to show how different personalities get along when forced together by a travel-bus breakdown. They hike to find an old house one remembers, and then try to make the best of what is or isn't there for survival until hopeful rescue. It is a serene place, but could be construed as not appealing to many viewers.

I found one thing disturbing: I couldn't hear some of the conversation. Some ladies had muted voices and I would have liked to hear everything said. Each conversation must have been interesting, but I got lost in some dialogue.

Then I learned that there were only a couple of actors and the rest were in fact just some interesting people they found to be in the film. I still don't which ones were the actors and which ones were not. They were all equally real. Somehow this simple story holds your interest all the way through. The production and direction, whatever it was, was hugely successful.

I've watched the film 3 times so far, and will watch it again. I'm also giving one to each of my kids and some other relatives for next Christmas.

470044,5,6302484286,"Conceived and directed by award winning Canadian film director Cynthia Scott, this is one of the wisest, tenderest and most beautiful films I have ever seen.  She uses mostly (all???) non professional actors, all seniors and I guess all strangers in real life who improvise dialog and events from their own lives around the plot line.  The plot is about 7 strangers stranded together for a few days in the wilderness after their bus breaks down.  The texture of the film is richly synesthetic and deeply spiritual with a resonant soundtrack of mostly classical music, the sounds of birds and frogs, the splash of water, the rustle of grasses blowing in the wind and  powerful stark Wyeth like images of the fields and lake and broken down buildings where they take refuge. There are long spaces of silence in this film when we see the characters and their surroundings and activities with no dialogue.  These spaces are where the film's real alchemy comes into being. Well into the film, when we have come to know ( and love) each character, she uses photos from each persons earlier life and you realize you are already deeply connected to these 7 beautiful women of great humanity and good will.  It is available for sale here at Amazon in DVD( and is the kind of film you'll want to watch over and over and share with friends)It is also available as an Instant Play on Netflix.",1286236800,,1380,4.658436213991769

Makes us ALL stop and think and truly rejoice and appreciate LIFE whatever stage of it we may be in---we're all in the stage of the LIVING.  And, makes us understand and appreciate others and the similarities we all share mixed with the various circumstances we all do or can find ourselves in.

They are delightfully resourceful as they fish and forage for food and amuse themselves with entertainment.

Other reviewers speak about the closeness of the women, but I disagree.  I was about to order the film, but I experienced a pulling down in my heart and gut that made me very uncomfortable.  I sat with this feeling for an hour or so, stared at the sky to see the not-here Perseids, and then it came to me...

Women, we U.S., Canadian, other? women, covet our personal experiences to a degree that makes it nearly impossible for us to join together, to see ourselves as ""sisters,"" to stop beating each other up on the job, to get deserved wages and place in society, etc.

Our ""shared"" experiences are done so only on the most superficial level; at least, that is what we choose.  We are covetous of our personal stories.  We may share them, but God help any woman who suggests that she knows how another woman feels, or thinks.  ""Namaste"" does not exist except for gender identification.

Men, as a rule, do not seem to covet their personal experiences, and are far more apt to recognize themselves in each other.  That's the hypothesis for tonight.  Now, to figure out why.",1281398400,,1472,4.597701149425287

We rarely see women of this age on film for any extended length of time, which gives it an intrinsic novelty. These are women from a modest and self-effacing generation; no doubt if a similar film were made ten years from now about a group of Boomer-aged women stranded, it would be much different! The women in this film have been brought up to expect little and be satisfied with humble pleasures. The way they patiently wait and amiably pass the time until they are rescued will die with their generation. The women confess their small pleasures, sorrows and anxieties with each other and treat each other with gentle sympathy. I was sorry when the film ended and the women vanished into the fog at the end.

The story is given so subtly, so gently...each woman reveals herself, her past, present and future to the other and wonderful friendships ensue.
I could watch this again and again. Parts of it made me laugh - Michelle's singing, Alice's fish adventures...and parts of it made me sad...Constance's fear of dying, Cissy recounting the war.

It is a reminder to younger people that when a person is 40 or 50 or 60 or more, our feelings and ideas don't stop.  We still want love and affection.  And in our minds we are still 20 years old, in love, with our whole lives ahead of us.

Join this group of elderly ladies whose day outing on a bus turns into a journey of interdependence, self disclosure and survival. The spirit of these characters is wonderful to see unfold and it is made all the better when it becomes clear that they are in fact 'acting' their own lives. The movie is accompanied by a Director's commentary that should not be missed and an outline of the characters.

With much of it improv, it feels more like a documentary. Like ""survivor for seniors."" What happens if you drop a busload of very old women off in the woods and tell them to fend for themselves?

It's all very civilized, and there's not a lot of urgency about it. No pulling straws to see who gets eaten. Just a bunch of old women (and one mildly injured young one) trying to figure out how to divide an apple into 7ths while sharing the details of their lives. The most intriguing, for me, aspect of this film is that the actresses played themselves. Nonagenerian Constance Garneau was really Nonagenerian Constance Garneau, and when she weeps with fear at the thought of her impending death it doesn't feel like acting. Octagenerian Cissy Medding's bewildered grief as she faces her own fear of a life unloved and alone is not feigned.

But don't let me mislead you--this movie is not depressing. It's affirming. These old girls get along very nicely with each other and their world, and while there are no answers to the deeper dilemmas they face (we do get the sense that Constance may find hers), they manage their present challenge with an enviable bon vivant. In places, in fact, it's very funny. The interaction between Mary Meigs and Cissy Meddings when Mary reveals her awkward secret is priceless.

At the time the film was made, the 7 women, all non-actors, were feeling old and marginalized in their lives. Their situation changed one magical summer when they became unlikely movie stars. This film is a record of that summer. The viewer is caressed by the presence of these women as they open up and blossom before our eyes on screen. Enduring friendships were forged among cast members, many of whom felt their participation in this film was the best experience of their lives. Inevitably, most of the cast members are now gone. It is rewarding to know that these women lived to experience their standing ovations when the film was initially released.

470185,5,6302484286,"The American historian Page Smith once wrote, ""After an acquaintance of ten minutes, many women will exchange confidences that a man would not reveal to a lifelong friend.""  It's true that ""Strangers in Good Company"" is set in beautiful country and that the friendships that are born and explored during its hour-and-a-half length are absolutely charming and endearing to the Nth degree, but I believe more than anything else, it portrays the sense of sisterhood that exists among women over the age of 40.  There's just something about being a woman who's no longer thought of as ""young"" that bonds women to each other, when they finally realize that gravity and hemorrhoids happen and there are worse things in life than growing old, and that being married (all a girl thinks about when she's young) isn't the be-all and end-all of a woman's existence.  The women in this film are generally older than me but still, I felt that sense of sisterhood among them, and loved watching as each revealed her past, noting how some still revel in being alive while others seem to have given up and now wait to die.  What really tickled me was, each character reminded me of a person I know in my own life (altho' I doubt my great aunt---a former school teacher---would be pleased to hear that ""an ol' Lesbian"" reminded me of HER [hahahahahahahahaha!]):  Winnie, the dancer, who still thinks of herself as graceful and sexy; sweet little Cissy, almost overcome with emotion whenever she thinks of her son; Mary who, for all her art and appreciation for birds and nature, seems to take the world so literally; Catherine singing hymns while she works; Michelle who's younger than the others, but still senses that she has more in common with these ""old ladies"" than she thought at first glance; Beth, the loner, who at 80 is still self-conscious about her appearance; Constance, whose physical presence, as she sat and walked about, reminded me SO much of my dear little maternal grandmother (except that Grandma was full of joy until the moment of her death at age 92); and Alice, dear Alice.  I've always had an ""Alice""-type person in my life, an Earth mother sort who, when faced with the possibility of her own death, decides to go fishing instead.

The delight of this movie is in its realistic approach to the characters and how they each respond to their current dilemma and the weaving in of their stories, which the viewer cannot help but see as a very accurate description of the actors themselves and their own lives. Actual photos of the actors from childhood to the near past are intermittently used in the movie and help to lend clarity to the characters and actors themselves. I love that each character reflects on her life as a young and then elderly woman and how they have to rely on each other by foraging for food in and around the lake and sleeping on makeshift bedding until help arrives.

It's soothing but potent, with amazing music, cinematography, and a rich storyline. Honestly, there is not much I do not love about it. I have paid for three months of Fandor just to watch it on my computer when I am stressed out. I cannot recommend it more than that.",1496620800,,423,4.653333333333333
