7538378,2,B017YBJQ1Q,"One shot wonder check. Witless characters check. Redundant dialogue check, infantile plot check. "" Fly away birdman?"", only if we're talking about camera work. Fortunately for us, (and unfortunately for the producers of Victoria) it takes a great story to make a film worth 2 hours of your time. Warning plot spoilers coming next! A pretty girl leaves a rave bar in the wee hours with 4 new strangers? We have to assume she has none of the self preservation, or  instinct necessary for anyone to survive as a new transplant to a large city, unless she is incapacitated which she isn't. So we have to assume she's very very naive. Guys intentions turn out to be harmless, lucky for her. Then for what seems an eternity we're forced to listen to 20-somethings calling each other ""retard "" repeatedly, I can see young teens doing this but aimless college age folk doing it just makes them seem unbelievable and unlikeble. This banter plays out with  every sentence repeated 3 or 4 times because the characters are high or drunk or really dumb, or all of the above How fun, if such behavior is tiresome with your own over indulged firiends imagine the torture of actors doing it to make you care about their story, it's annoying, tedious and you soon  forget all about the technical talent displayed in the camera wizardry. And the unrealistic plot is glaring. Girl works in bakery but classically trained pianist, so maybe taking a pause in life but educated, ambitious, and intelligent you would think. Then for no particular reason other than a fleeting infatuation she decides to risk her life on an excursion not divulged but not disqused either, on something obviously nefarious with the 4 new strangers in her life. Mind you this is all driven with drunken banter repeated incessantly. Headache yet? Wait it turns out these protagonist really do think like 6th graders. After getting lucky pulling off a crime they drive slowly in circles in a stolen car then decide to go dance naked at the earlier rave bar. No attention grabbing behavior there. After being ejected from the bar they return to the same stolen car they had just wiped down to eliminate prints! Carnage ensues. As I said this lovely story is portrayed through the drunken super repetitive dialogue of half wits. Your choice.",1452384000,2,2294,4.787878787878788
7538379,3,B017YBJQ1Q,"It's an immaculate accomplishment and exhilarating ride to follow this girl through every second of this crazy journey alongside her. It did grip me as I watched it and as the more major events unfolded, it had me on edge; but, it did feel like a lot of waiting to get to those moments.

Overall, this is a masterpiece of technical filmmaking and I really admire the filmmakers for going for it and really pulling it off. That being said, as a film, stripped away of that asterisk, it was merely good. At times it felt a little like modern mumblecore films where we're just hanging out with a group of friends (and the characters do have a charm to them, especially the lead), but then some real plot drops and you join them on this intense adventure but it ultimately isn't that invigorating or new. And the lead character seems quite passive in much of the movie, reaching a point at the end where it felt like storywise, they didn't want to put in any definitive choices as to whether this young woman approved of what had happened or if she was forever changed. And some will say, ""Obviously she's changed, look at what happened to her"" but the movie doesn't tell you or even hint to that...it just shows events that happen (in real time), and then just kind of ends, so as to say, ""Hmph. Wasn't that a crazy night you witnessed? In ONE TAKE!"", rather than saying something more, or letting the main character react somehow so we can agree or disagree with her. It just...ends.

Also...felt the need to write this review cuz I only saw 5 star reviews (and a 1 star from a probably rightfully impatient individual). Had to represent the middle grounders.",1452297600,4,1657,4.52

Since 2003 with the film The Russian Arc (the first movie) to get a film in just one shot has always been a gruesome and couraging adventure.

But the fact to watch the movie in real time is a rewarding experience. To be aware you're in the middle of nowhere in Kreutzberg in Berlin where each movement may be dangerous makes you get involved far beyond the conventional limits.

7538385,5,B017YBJQ1Q,"One City. One Night. One Take"", boast the promos for Sebastian Schipper's blistering crime flick/romance, Victoria. There's no getting around what the film promises to be, a two-hour plus story all done in one camera shot, and honestly so, not a series of clever edits like Birdman. While the ""gimmick"" of the single-take sequence has grown tiresome and a crutch too many filmmakers lean on as proof of their supposed skill, Schipper uses it to brazen, ballsy effect, crafting a cinematic experience that is unlike any other you'll experience this year.

Victoria is one of those films it's best to go in to completely cold, because where it begins is a total 180 from where it ends up. Shot across 22 locations with a razor thin screenplay to encourage improvisation, the film takes place in the late night party hearty hours of Berlin, where we meet Victoria (Laia Costa) as she dances the evening away. A Spanish transplant looking to make new friends, she encounters four guys who instantly look like they could be trouble. We can't help but fear the worst. The street toughs are Sonne (Frederick Lau), Boxer (Franz Rogowski), Blinker (Burak Yigit), and Fu (Max Mauff), and the ease with which Victoria latches on to them shows her disturbing desperation. Even as they start to get a little more belligerent, especially the rowdy Boxer, Victoria doesn't want to leave their orbit. She's only got a couple of hours before she has to open up the cafe for work, but leaving her newfound friends is simply something she doesn't want to do.

Part of the reason she won't leave is the casual, completely charming flirtation she shares with Sonne, and their growing attraction encapsulates the film's first hour. As dizzying as DP Sturla Brandth Grovlen's camera was in the opening party scene, it takes a less intrusive position as these two organically fall in love over the evening's course. Their courtship takes some small, awkward diversions, but builds naturally. There's the reticence about that first romantic contact, the offering up of personal, somewhat embarrassing information. We're so invested in them that if this is all the film were it would still be a richly observed romantic drama.

But it's just a facade, a clever ruse to lower our guards. A phone call to Boxer sends the film into an unexpected overdrive as a heist plot emerges that will leave you breathless. The original single-shot conceit takes on a greater urgency as events spiral out of control. Driven by chaotic plotting rather than understated characterization, the film takes on a completely different kind of energy. The transition from astute Before Sunrise-style love story to kinetic thriller in the vein of Run Lola Run is seamless. Some of the decisions the characters make, and the bonkers situations they get thrown into, stretch the limits of plausibility. However it's the continuous camerawork and the grip it has on you that never allows a moment to consider flaws in logic. There's also no denying the exhilaration in the film's change in genre, with the ensuing fallout producing some wildly tense and gorgeously shot action sequences. A shootout later on is as beautifully rendered as an earlier, quieter scene in which Victoria plays the piano for an enraptured Sonne.

Looking back on Victoria it's amazing to think it was all done in a single take in only a few run-throughs. The level of commitment from Laia Costa to so completely embody the role of Victoria is astonishing because the film hangs on her ability to do so. While somewhat overlong and a bit slow in the early going, Victoria literally has something for everybody. It works as a love story, a stirring drama, and an exciting crime thriller. Once it's over you'll be dying to watch it one more time to see how such an achievement could be accomplished.",1448409600,15,3819,4.9071207430340555

7538388,4,B017YBJQ1Q,"Victoria is a single-take German thriller sensation. Set in Berlin we go on a wild ride with a Spanish girl Victoria, picked up by Berliners in a night club. The predominant language spoken is in their shared language, English. Victoria is nave to share her night with these 4 males, but the acting of this 3rd take non-stop serves the plot. There is the sheer chutzpah of everyone involved. They take her (and her bike) up to a roof-top and gaze at the stars. Victoria is a bit giddy as she aided Sonne to steal beer from an off-license(owner was sleeping). She also goes close to the edge on the roof-top, worrying Sonne,who tells her to come away. She keeps on saying she has to go to work in an early morning caf,she needs to get sleep, but is drawn to these gamblers of the moment(who have stolen a car). She finds it harder to withdraw,she has crossed the line that binds them. She invites Sonne into her place of work early before work begins, so she can prepare things. The other men go off somewhere, and when they return Boxer says he has to return a favour to someone who protected him in prison, he has promised to take part in a bank robbery,and because 4 people are needed and one of the men incapacitated, Victoria too gets drawn into this heist. She agrees to be the  get-away driver. She seems to go along with this crazy punt.

The actors are under tremendous pressure,especially the two leads, who are given a degree of flexibility, in terms of improvising their lines. The exhilaration comes from knowing they have to do it in one go, with the risks involved. Some of the plot turns are implausible, but you go for the ride,the excitement of being in a foreign city, being shown the adventure of the real Berlin to Victoria. Has she any motivation? She tells Sonne about her sense of failure and ennui (would-be concert pianist still bruised by her failure to make the grade). Due to a language barrier between Victoria and her new German friends,she is left out of crucial conversations which the audience with the benefit of subtitles,understand,emphasising Victorias vulnerability. There is an episode when Victoria and Sonne escape from a police shoot-out and get into someones apartment, and use the couples baby girl as part of a disguise to exit the building unchallenged by police. This shows a decline in Victorias morals. What I cant decide is why she gives up her secure job in a cafeteria to drown in danger. Are we too taken in by appearances when we know very little about these people? Grovlens complex camerawork ducks and weaves through the shadows of a long, drunken night. The film takes you where it will lead. Laia Costa and Frederick Lau excellent in key roles. This has been an art-house

It does take over an hour to get to the scenes even leading up to tension or action would be what I didn't like about it the most.  For an hour or so the viewer is just subjected to drunken nonsense from the four guys while one of them hopes to get into Victoria's pants. Sure this is realistic but it's annoying enough when any of your friends get to this stage after a big night, and you're only putting up with it to look after them and stop them from doing something that will get them beat up, arrested or killed. It's not real enjoyable viewing would be my point and yet that's what the first hour gives us. This could have been a lot shorter, an perhaps the scenes between the parking garage and the robbery a bit longer.

I also wondered would you really get hired to work in a coffee shop if you couldn't speak the native language of the customers who would visit there? Sure most Germans can also speak English but I would think if you walked into a shop in your own country you'd have an expectation the staff would speak your native language. If she worked in a backpacker hostel or something this might have been a little more plausible. It's more likely she'd be a cleaner or something where she didn't have to communicate with the public, which would have added to her desire to do something a bit more exciting and take the risks she does over the two and a half hours of the film.",1469664000,,1573,4.25752508361204

7538401,5,B017YBJQ1Q,"I had heard a lot about this so was looking forward to it; the plot is that a young Spanish girl, Victoria of the title played impressively by Laia Costa, is out one night in Berlin when she meets four young and highly spirited young men. She wants to make new friends and so goes along with their schoolboy larks.

Sonne is particularly taken with her and as the night progresses they all learn more about each other and as the booze flows so too do the confessions until a really dark one is revealed that will have consequences that likewise are of a dark nature.

Now to say any more would be entering plot spoiler land. One thing to note is that this is filmed and told in real time. The not a lot happening  bits are there as well as the other loads happening bits. It is all seen from Victorias perspective and the actors are all just superb. The direction of this looks minimal as it is all so naturalistic. You actually feel as if this is a fly on the wall documentary at times without the voice over. This has to be a massive credit to director Sebastian Schipper who also wrote this.

7538407,4,B017YBJQ1Q,"Victoria,"" directed by Sebastian Schipper, is notable for having been shot in one continuous take. Victoria (Laia Costa) is a young woman from Madrid who has left her routinized life in Spain and come to Germany to relax and party. Supporting herself with a low-responsibility job at a cafe, she seeks out late-night entertainment in all-night bars and underground clubs. At one such club, she meets Sonne (Frederick Lau) and his buddies. After drinking, dancing, and enjoying the music with them, Victoria discovers that they are bank robbers. Intrigued, she agrees to be their driver in a planned heist.

In real time, we see Victorias dark adventure unfold as the gang plans the robbery and puts the final plan into action. The tone of the movie changes from happy-go-lucky hedonistic abandon to pure film-noir. The stakes are upped and lives are on the line. Sonne and his crew are not professional thieves, nor do they purport to be. Though they believe they are going about the robbery intelligently with due planning, there is the constant feeling that things could go wrong at any turn.

Filming in one take has obvious logistical problems varying camera movement to avoid static framing, having actors deliver their lines perfectly, blocking movement precisely, and overall meticulous coordination of cast and crew. And it can turn a movie into more a showcase for cinematography than a vehicle for a good story.

Other directors have experimented masterfully with lengthy takes. In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese shot a scene where we follow a group entering a nightclub, walking through hallways and down stairways, and finally being seated at a front table near the stage. Alfred Hitchcock, as early as 1948, filmed Rope in a series of ten-minute takes.

Here, director Schipper succeeded, after a few failed attempts, in getting his entire two-hour story in a single take while calling minimal attention to the technique. Were very conscious of the cinematography initially, but once Victoria makes the decision to engage in a criminal pursuit, were hooked with suspense heightening by the minute. Rather than a gimmicky effort, Victoria has a great payoff.

7538419,4,B017YBJQ1Q,"Victoria is the name of the girl the plot revolves around, but that isn't enough to justify the banal title. Its not the story of her life, just 2 hours and 13 minutes of it. I can say that because the movie is shot in and presented as a single take. That means everything happens in real time, no cuts whatsoever, a marvelous feat rarely accomplished before in the history of pop cinema. Of course, it wouldnt mean much without a story thats at least interesting. This one is poignant and thoroughly engaging.

It helps a lot that Victoria, played by Laia Costa, is both cute and charming. It takes almost an hour for the plot; shes on an escapade with a small group of guys she just met in Berlin; to kick into gear, but its never boring. Thats mostly because the characters, improvised from a general outline, don't talk or act like they're in a movie. Though the underlying theme of romantic attraction is totally clich, thus disappointing, the charming chemistry between Victoria and one of the guys (Sonne) seems genuine.

Whether or not the potential couple would do in real life what they do during the second half of this movie is another question. It seems unlikely for the reasons given, especially for Victoria, who seems to have nothing significant to gain in comparison to the risks she takes. But the foolhardy personality she displays early on; the initial set-up suggests her naivety will lead to gang rape; makes it a realistic possibility. With that, you're along for the ride as a suspenseful crime drama unfolds before your eyes.

7538420,4,B017YBJQ1Q,"Long, single-shot camera takes have been a popular cinematic technique since Hitchcock played with it in his classic Rope, where the mystery unravels like the titular coiled thread, in one continuous, seemingly unedited narrative. Hitch skillfully cut his shots by panning close over characters backs, or zooming in tight on objects, and while its quite obvious where the cuts occur to the desensitized eye of the current moviegoer, back in 1948 it was revolutionary, and paved the way to such contemporary classics as Children of Men, Birdman, Gravity and the not-so-classic The Silent House. Sebastian Schippers Victoria doesnt have the technical precision or production values of those Hollywood giants, but the lack of gloss plays in its favor. Its not a mere gimmick; the one-take approach is crucial to the story.

Right off the bat, the film establishes its propulsive rhythm by plunging us into Berlins kaleidoscopic club scene, the electronic soundtracks four-by-four beat resembling the human pulse. Victoria (Laia Costa), recently relocated from Madrid, dances by herself, then flirts with the waiter, somewhat-desperately. She seeks a connection in a new city, which has left her alone and dejected - that is, until she meets the persistent and charming Sonne (Frederick Lau) on the way out of the club.

Sonne hangs out with his gang of self-proclaimed (on multiple occasions) true Berliners: hotheaded Boxer (Franz Rogowski), goofy Blinker (Burak Yigit), and increasingly wasted Fuss (Max Mauff). After casually trying to steal a car and escaping from its owner, they promise to show Victoria the real Berlin. Exhilarated by their acceptance, Victoria eagerly joins them, to soon discover that the real Berlin involves stealing booze from a liquor shop, whose elderly clerk is deep asleep. When Victoria questions the theft, Sonne assures her, Ill pay him back tomorrow. Ive known him a very long time. Shes not quite buying it, but goes along with it, even grabbing a bag of peanuts on the way out.

Sonnes entourage of misfits is brash, intimidating, careless - but also goofy and intriguing. Sonne focuses on flirting with Victoria, while his gang bounces and causes havoc around him, shifting from playfulness to animosity within seconds - particularly the violence-prone Boxer. Police cars drive by, faceless cops eyeing them suspiciously, a foreboding presence.

Minor misdemeanors lead to bigger stakes, with Sonne eventually asking Victoria to take part in an impromptu heist. She sinks deeper and deeper into the quicksand, as the audience watches helplessly. The film does a great job evoking tension through language barrier: we understand whats unraveling sooner than Victoria, who doesnt speak German - another nifty ode to Hitchcock. We know the bomb is ticking under that table, always seconds ahead of the films hapless lead.

There are many standout sequences in Victoria, a few particularly worth pointing out, such as when the characters dialogue fades, and a minimalist piano score (courtesy of composer Nils Frahm) follows them for a while, making Victoria seem trapped, naive and helpless in the company of daunting hoodlums. There is also a beautiful little detour, when Victoria plays piano for Sonne - a tender moment, the calm before the storm. Other gripping scenes include a sudden panic attack; a car engine dying at a crucial moment; a breathless, white-knuckle escape, and the consequent prolonged chase sequence which, while lacking credibility at times, never loses momentum.

The cinematography by Sturla Brandth Grvlen is spectacular. The single-take approach works seamlessly, making one forget they're watching what is essentially an extended cinematic stunt - quite the feat. Without the experience or budgetary resources of, say, Gravitys Emmanuel Lubezki, Grvlen pulls it off with aplomb, demonstrating a proficiency thats truly awe-inspiring. Whether or not digital editing trickery was used, the fact that my trained eye wasn't able to tell makes Victoria a stunning technical achievement.

The unflinching, almost intrusive camerawork also serves the story, emphasizing its heroines claustrophobic spiral into the depths of immorality, and the films central theme of circular fate: we revisit locations, which all seem within driving distances of each other, but take on different connotations as the story progresses; the film ends virtually the same way it begins, with one major difference I won't spoil here. Victorias rope forms an ouroboros, both visually and thematically.

Laia Costa in the titular role brings to mind Carey Mulligan with her doe eyes, an endearing fragility and reserves of hidden/unexpected strength. If theres one nag, its Victorias naivet&eacute;, which at times approaches pure stupidity. There are several moments in the film where she should have just said no. Sonne even offers to take her back to safety at a crucial point, to which she firmly - and inexplicably - responds, I want to go back with you. Perhaps its an intentional choice, showing the lengths to which one would go to avoid solitude, but Victorias past is not clearly enough defined to make her actions justifiable. While there are definitely traces of attraction, she is not expressly in love with Sonne either; love at first sight would have at least provided a semblance of rationale.

That said, it was the filmmakers choice, and Costa manages to overcome her characters lack of concrete motivation with a commanding, soulful performance. Frederick Lau almost steals scenes as the by turns mischievous, affectionate and precarious Sonne, the leader of the pack.

Schipper, a German director who has worked with Tom Tykwer on several occasions, clearly learned from the auteur, and brings an energy and flow to Victoria that brings to mind Tykwers Run Lola Run. The suspense builds fast, beat by beat, the director layering it on like a master pastry chef.

Despite my niggles with the protagonists (lack of) reasoning, Victoria does effectively demonstrate how easily susceptible we all find ourselves to perilous influences, especially when displaced, lost and alone. Its also a visceral portrait of current-day Berlins seedier side, focusing on the lower-middle-class youth, its aimlessness and pathos. Above all, Victoria succeeds at being a thrill ride, and sustaining our breathless attention, in one take, for over two hours. It shows that, when used well, long takes can have a powerful and lasting effect. Bring on The Revenant.",1453334400,,6496,5.321637426900585
7538421,5,B017YBJQ1Q,"The best film I saw at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival and one of the best films I've seen ever! It's a 2.5 hour film shot in one continuous take in the streets of Berlin. About a Spanish University student who befriends a group of guys at a night club and for the first half of the film wanders the streets of the city to discuss life and other topics like in ""Before Sunrise"" Then the film totally shifts gears and organically turns into a bank heist. At this point you are so totally immersed into the characters that you actually feel like you are a part of the heist and the ensuing police chase. It left me breathless at the end. Even though neither the director or any of the cast were in attendance at the screening, it got a standing ovation at the 1500 seat theater!",1453075200,,775,4.243243243243243

7538424,5,B017YBJQ1Q,"Sebastian Schippers flawless masterpiece is a potent reminder of why I love cinema. It expertly evokes the entire gamut of human emotion, and its actors have some of the best chemistry that I have ever seen in a film. More than any film this year, Victoria is best viewed without knowing too much about the plot. The film consists of a single, 140 minute take, and yet it ends so far away from where it begins that it is easy to forget that the story unfolds in real time: A young woman from Spain meets a group of German guys as she is leaving a club in Berlin. You get the sense that shes lonely, bored, and frustrated with her life, and so she continues to hang out with them, even when things don't seem quite right. Shes drawn to Sonne, the charming young man who initially approaches her: most of the first half of the film shows their carefree and playful interaction. The audience falls in love with the characters at the same time as the two main characters fall in love with one another... And then something happens, and would Victoria be willing to do just one, small favor?

There is nothing gimmicky about the fact that the film is a single shot  actually one shot, not edited to appear that way: its a decision that thrusts the audience into the film, in the same way that Victoria is thrust into the events of the story. At first blush the plot might seem absurd, and yet, emotionally and logically, each sequence seems to follow inescapably from the sequence that precedes it, and the viewer is left with the sense that none of the characters ever quite grasp the gravity of the decisions that they are making. Victoria is powerfully well made  its my favorite film of this year, and one of my favorite films of any year.",1452729600,,1738,4.4420062695924765

Seriously, one of the best movies I've seen, on so many levels, dramatically, technically, logistically, performances, cinematography, etc. Please do yourself a favor and watch it!",1452643200,,262,5.743589743589744
8741044,3,B017YBJQ1Q,"Victoria is a successful experiment! As with every experiment, describing the movie falls short of experiencing it. However, experiencing it, stresses its unconventional nature, possibly making it uninteresting for some viewers. Upon closer inspection, it gets clear that the underlying motivation was primarily on the technical aspects, and as the movie progresses less on the characters and on the plot. After all, the viewer marvels at how the scenes were shot, which means the clear focus lies on how the movies production works  and not so much on the plot and on the characterization. Technically speaking, this movie achieved everything it was intended to do and as the movie is one of two feature films shot in this way, it is a required viewing for people interested in filmmaking.
Overall 7/10

That said, very poor story and too much focus on showing Berlin craziness? Further, the tempo of the movie was also too slow. Too long arguments and scenes that didn't flow. Long story short, didn't worth the money.",1517097600,,339,4.65

8741050,4,B017YBJQ1Q,"""Victoria"" is a gimmick film from director Sebastian Schipper, who, a long time ago, appeared in the German art-house hit, ""Run Lola Run."" Perhaps looking for a way to update the run-and-gun formula, Schipper attempts to razzle-dazzle the audience with a single take, following the action through an unbroken shot that lasts a whopping 138 minutes. As a technical achievement, ""Victoria"" is impressive, working with loose choreography and precise planning to turn a casual night of drinking for the players in this dangerous game into a turbulent series of personal challenges. While it's a neat idea, Schipper doesn't have anything more to offer than the basic cinematographic stunt, taking such a long time to position characters into the heat of the moment, he forgets to add the moment.",1501027200,3,790,5.1796875

It looked kind of interesting and had an 84% on Rotten Tomatoes, so what the hell.  The film is out of Germany and takes place in Berlin.  What seems to get everyones attention and accolades is the fact that the movie, all 138 minutes, is filmed in one shot.  Yep, no breaks.  One continuous shot.  Director and writer Sebastian Schipper forgot one thing, however.  A plausible story, not to mention interesting one.

The film opens at a nightclub with Victoria (Laia Costa) dancing alone, then snuggling up to the bar for one last shot of schnapps before heading out into the early morning streets.  We quickly gather shes a bit lonely after flirting with the bartender a bit.  As she unshackles her bicycle, a quartet of young, drunk German men approach her and Im thinking no, don't do it.  Victoria is from Spain and is working in a caf.  She doesnt speak much German.  The guys don't speak Spanish, so they converse in broken English.  With plenty of opportunity for Victoria to get on her bike, go home and get some sleep before she opens up the caf, she of course doesnt.  What planet is this girl from?

Surprisingly, the guys while flirtatious don't go where I feared they might.  So the camera follows them around the nearly empty streets, while the guys act stupid and do stupid things.  Victoria seems to like the attention and goes with it.  We follow them to some buildings rooftop where they must talk in whispers.  One of the guys, Sonne (Frederick Lau), takes a bit of a shine to Victoria and she to him.  So they talk and we listen in.  Who cares?  I didnt.  Eventually, too late to go home, Victoria and Sonne go to the caf.  They talk some more.

In the only interesting part of the movie, Victoria plays a piano and does it quite well.  Evidently not well enough to get into a conservatory in Madrid.  She tells Sonne of her frustration.  He seems sympathetic.  Finally, Sonne has to leave with his friends for a job.  One of the buddies is too drunk, so they entice Victoria to come along.  Now they need a driver.

By this time, Im well over an hour invested into this movie and I just felt like the 5th wheel observing some casual flirtation between a stupid young man and an equally stupid young woman.  Before I pulled the plug I skipped ahead to see if anything interesting was happening.  A heist, with some violence.  Boy.  Not worth waiting for.  While critics seem to be slobbering all over themselves loving this movie.  The one-shot trickery does not make a good movie no matter how well it is technically done.",1483920000,,2672,4.519916142557652
