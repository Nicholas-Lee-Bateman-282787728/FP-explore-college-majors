2053400,3,B00020X9CE,"I saw part of the series, and fell in love with it. Too bad it was on Cartoon Network. I bought the movie in hopes of finishing it, since anime's a very expensive hobby, even going mainstream (I fear for the state of anime, what with people believing in dragon ball which is at least a 16 year old franchise).

The movie left a sour taste in my mouth, and my wallet. It reeks with ""bargain"". I'm gonna go save up and buy the series set hopefully someday. Characters I grew attached to, such as cute little Yung and Marlene's original retrieval team, die without much character development. Their deaths in the series gave more impact after knowing more about them. I regret buying this, so as everyone else says, BUY/SEE THE SERIES, AVOID THIS, unless you're die-hard to collect it all. This only worth seeing, not keeping, if you have the series.",1115769600,,847,4.5359477124183005
2053401,4,B00020X9CE,"I bought the DVD box set for the series, and decided that I would give this compilation movie a try. What are the results?
The movie itself is ok, it's good but not perfect. Alot of the footage from the series has been modified for the movie, but there is also scenes specifically for the movie, which makes it a bit more original. The story is very different from the series, and it's ending is a bit of a shocker. Don't worry, it's not a bad ending like you'd see on most Outer Limits episodes, but it'll leave you feeling weird.
The story mostly focuses on Yuji and Marlene, and pretty much rightfully so, since those are the two main characters. However, the draw back to that is that we don't see many wonderful characters that were in the series. Some roles for characters are even switched around a bit.
This movie goes to at least 95 minutes. This is I think another small weakness for the movie. If there was an extra 10 to maybe 20 minutes, the movie could've played out a bit better. Like the series, it's not without some weaknesses, but they aren't overpowering.
But on the plus side, you get most of the story in one setting, alot of action, and a fairly decent romance between Yuji and Marlene. Unlike the series, this movie has no fan service at all, which makes it more friendly to viewers in one way. But the violence and dark aspect of the movie go up as a result.
Overall, this is a fairly decent compilation movie. Fans of Blue Gender who want to get everything about it will probably get this movie to complete their collections. I myself like Blue Gender, and getting this movie in my opinion was well worth it. However, if you see the movie first, it may seem different, and especially more so if you've seen the series first. If you're new to Blue Gender, it is mostly better to see the series first, then see the movie, even though this is one 95 minute setting. If you are unsure, rent it first if you can before you buy it.",1096416000,8,1951,4.347945205479452
2053402,2,B00020X9CE,"First of all, if you've seen the ""Blue Gender"" series - STOP! If you haven't, I would still suggest seeing the actual series rather than this ""movie."" A few things change here, such as the main character (Yuji) having long hair at the beginning. The ending to this movie is terrible. The real series had a MUCH better ending. The bottom line is if you're expecting to see something new here, expect to be dissapointed. And if you're expecting to pack the full ""Blue Gender"" experience into 100 minutes, you're missing out on A LOT! In summary, get the series, forget the ""movie.""",1096156800,3,579,4.631067961165049
2053403,3,B00020X9CE,I would not recommend this dvd if you plan on buying or own the Blue Gender Box set.  It is just a 90min version of the entire series.  With very few differences like long hair and most of all the ending.  I like the ending in the series better than the one in the Warrior.  But if you don't plan on buying the series or just want a preview before buying the set it will give you an idea of what Blue Gender is all about.,1093910400,2,421,3.86046511627907

8019813,5,B00020X9CE,"Roughly the entire Blue Gender series edited together into a feature film. Now, as previously stated in other reviews. The original series is much more in depth. The film, does skip a few key points. With that said, you could spend $20-30 on the box set (movie included) or if your just looking for a very entaining animated film. Save yourself some cash & pick this up. It is still very well made for what it is. Enjoy!",1462233600,,420,4.397435897435898
8019814,1,B00020X9CE,"Simply putted : Waste... What FunAnimation ""Reversionned"" , if you can call that , is just a rehash of Ry'suke Takahashi's work , with badly edited bits and misplaced cuts. Oh , and they also removed all the ""Adult content"" (Kissing sceens) as if the glimps you get in the series would shock anyone compare to the amount of gore there is all along Yuji's journey .
Also the dialogues are crappy , the development of the relationship between characters  isn't worth to be mentioned since it is inexistant .

Conclusion : Fun Animation should refrain itself from doing rehash of a 26 episodes series , revising the story ,censuring , and putting their name on someone else work.",1334880000,,676,4.6722689075630255
8019815,2,B00020X9CE,"Don't bother. This movie tries to slap together over 600 minutes of story and character developement into 90 minutes. Did not work very well at all. So much of the emotion leading the characters throughout the movie is nonexistant. The whole explanation of the B-virus and the reason behind the blue has no part in this film either. I rated this 1 more star than I wanted to becuase if you are a fan of the series and your smart enough to buy the complete collection (whole series + crappy movie) then, what the heck watch it.",1224806400,,526,4.43298969072165
8019816,2,B00020X9CE,"First of all i would like to start off by saying that as far as the series go i would rate that a five star....in terms of the movie that they tried to produce based on it, it doesn't hold a candle to it. Another thing that should be noted about this movie is that if you watch it any time then after you have watched the whole series it will not make any sense to you...and when you watch it after you are left with a pit in your stomache that can only be described as sheer dissapointment. After watching the whole series and enjoying it fully from its first premere on adult swim many years ago i was expecting a lot. My expectations were that they would be smart and pick up where they left off but i was horribly mistaken. The movie is nothing more then mixed episodes spliced in lousily and put together in an attempt to salvage a movie for sheerly marketing purposes. SPOILERS DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. only changes are that for one yuji wakes up and has long red hair...whaoo. joey's death is far more gruesome...the commander who originally blows himself up dies from fatal wounds in the truck. Yuji and marlene are shown useing other modes of transportation to get to the russian space base such as a plane. Yuji confronts marlene about her cold attitude and they begin to brawl. Han doesn't take over the shuttle as before but still somehow fuses with the blue to wound yuji??? The army launches an all out attack on the blue and in all the chaos in the midst of yuji turning psychotic due to the b cells...........he dies at the end.
completley pointless to watch...transitions from scenes are horrible and fail to explain how one thing lead to another.....as i said before...its not a movie it was a marketing scheme..dont' waste your time.",1218672000,,1777,4.45398773006135
8019817,1,B00020X9CE,"Imagine, if you will, taking one of the greatest animes ever and chewing it up a pooping it out. All the best and most nutritious bits long gone. What you are left with is waist. Well in this case waist with a new ending nugget of corn... And that corn was rotten when it was first eaten...

If you must have this movie, buy the box set. At lest then you get the good stuff and the poo, although why you would want poo in the first place is beyond me...",1167264000,,453,3.978021978021978
8019818,3,B00020X9CE,"Having watched all the series and the movie called the ""Warrior"", my suggestion would be:

First of all, buy the box set called: `Blue Gender-The complete collection' for the following reasons:
- In this box set, you will have the entire series and the movie as a bonus
- It is definitely cheaper
- And lasts for about 750 min.

As for the shows, I wrote a detailed review in the `Blue Gender-The complete collection', where you can read everything. In one word, the series are: AMAZING!!! And highly recommended...

As the movie concerns it is basically, something like a short version of the series. In other words, they try to put about 600 minutes into 95. Not to mention that many things that build up the story are left outside (for obvious reasons) and that the ending is completely different from the series. Moreover, by watching the movie the viewer will get the impression that the series are not deep etc. an opinion that will change for sure if he or she will watch the series.

As for the storyline:

In the near future, the main character, Yuji Kaido, has been diagnosed, as other ordinary people, in having an incurable disease. Because there was no cure available at that time they put him with the others alike into hibernation, supposed for a time span of two years. Unfortunately for them, in the mean time Earth got invaded by alien bucks, called ""Blue"" and most humans got killed. For this reason, humans retreated to a space station called Second Earth. A few decades later, Yuji was awakened by a soldier among other commrades, who was sent down on earth to find the ""sleepers"" (and there is a reason for it), in other words the ones that had been put into hibernation. The soldier was no other than Marlene Angel, who is the other main character of the show. In the mists of war, a love story will start to evolve around these two main protagonists who will have to go through various dangers and do everything to survive and to safe the world (well, what is left of it). The story has many twists and although it refers to a (near)future time the messeges that this show ""sends out"" are all the ones that we are facing nowadays, like the environment, human behavior towards others, military/political power games etc. In the show we see a possible outcome of our actions.

To sum up:
Buy this DVD only if you are a huge Blue Gender fan, so that to have a complete collection. Therefore, if you are not sure what to do, rent this movie first before you decide (if of course you have such an option).

My recommendation  would be, to buy the complete collection of the series, where the movie is included; and is definitely cheaper.

I hope I could help....",1146960000,9,2681,4.545643153526971
8019819,5,B00020X9CE,"If you like Blue Gender as much as I do (which, it is my favorite Anime), you'll probably really enjoy this movie. I got it used for 8 bucks, and I think that is a reasonable price. There is a lot of the same animation, though, so if that is something that would bother you, just know that. I enjoy different ways stories can go, so I think this portrayal of Yuji and Marlene's relationship is quite cute. Unlike the series, this portrayal does not include a first kiss up on the mountain, but they do hold hands when he's watching the moon and wondering what is to come (just before Baikenor). The long hair on Yuji at the beginning is a bit freaky, so there's that, but you'll feel such vindication when Joey cuts it back into normalcy. Some parts of it are just a bit odd, and hard to understand, like the ending. But the ending of the series is also quite hard to understand, if you think about it. My favorite part of this movie is the romantic factor, but I also enjoy the very graphic nature of the scenes. Here's another warning for anyone who is interested in actually watching it--when Joey dies, WATCH OUT. His death in the movie is the exact opposite of his heart-warming death in the series. My 10 year-old sister almost puked, as Yuji himself does. I like the way some of the stuff played out even better than the way it's played out n the series. When you watch this you should keep in mind that this came first, so anything you liked better in the series should ammount to another cla on the back for the writers.",1138838400,3,1529,4.3125
8019820,1,B00020X9CE,"consider this a warning, and be glad that you got one.  the movie itself is $20.  the new box set (includes the movie) is around $50.  this means you get the series for only $30.  so if you are going to buy anything, it makes sense to buy the series.  and the series, unlike this movie, IS worth buying.

now, about the movie... the reason they include it in the new box set is that it's worthless.  like one of the other reviewers said, it follows exactly the same story as the series.  so, it's basically the first half of the Blue Gender story (and over half of the SAME ANIMATION) crammed into 90 minutes.  just imagine how much important stuff is missing! (would you only read every fifth page of a book or take turns and only play every 10th hour of an RPG?) and in addition, it's ""InuYasha'd"" with corny dialogue and the worst ending I have ever seen.  it's a shame i can't give zero stars.",1137801600,2,897,4.254437869822485
8019821,5,B00020X9CE,"It is a time of chaos. Earth is no longer what it used to be. It has infested with a bug like species called the Blue. Yuji Kaido, who has a mysterious disease is put into suspended animation until a cure is found. When he wakes up he learns it's been more then 20 years since he's been awake. In the future big alien bugs have distroyed everything.",1125532800,,349,4.147058823529412
