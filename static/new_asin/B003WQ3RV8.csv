8407460,5,B003WQ3RV8,This movie was very good. I hope they have a sequel to it. Must have and very glad I got the chance to own.,1440201600,,107,3.5
8407461,5,B003WQ3RV8,"A fun campy gore fest. I loved it. A cross between ""The Sorpanos"" and "" Two Thousand Maniacs"".  A very fun ride.",1411257600,,112,4.090909090909091
8407462,1,B003WQ3RV8,I was so shocked at how this movie started out-truly offensive. I give it 1 star and if I could mark it lower-then I would. That's all I have to say!,1331337600,,149,3.838709677419355
8407463,4,B003WQ3RV8,"I enjoy horror/slasher films, especially when you throw in comedy to lighten things up a bit when least expected.  This movie fit the bill for me.  Often these films include the same story line, where young attractive people get lost or get into a situation where things go terribly wrong and they all die except for one or two of them. Or there is a
""monster"" that terrorizes everyone, and the good guy and girl have to conquer it.  Thankfully, this movie has a new story line as stated in previous reviews.  Michael H Cole, who plays ""Weasel"", was a great/disgusting character.  I have seen him in other things on tv and at the theatre, but never in any role like this, he was truly an unlikeable person which you would expect, and it was refreshing to see that he looked like a real person, which in real life is what you have to look out for.  Not all deviants look like freaks.  The reason that I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the nudity and language.  This is so unnecessary, why do movie people think it is the norm?  Sure, swear words from the bad guys are expected, but all the ""f"" bombs just ticked me off, for me, it gets old fast.  Think of the horror films of the past, no sex scenes in detail, just a door closing, or intimacy implied is just as good and I don't like that todays young people who like to watch this type of film should have to see and hear all this stuff, it just is not needed when there is a good script.  I will admit that I am an older fan, 60, and while watching this film with my family, instead of being scared and grossed out at the violent, gory scenes which can be fun if watched with an eye for this type of thing,  some of the  grossed out part was from the language and sex scenes.  I suppose this type of film caters a great deal to those  who expect all that and thats kind of sad.  Old fogy that I am, I'll keep watching, its always fun to see how its all going to work out, the journey, if you will. Pretty  good job Lynch Mob!",1320364800,4,1996,4.116279069767442
8407464,5,B003WQ3RV8,"Well done!!!  Or should I say medium rare?  Great flick!  Definitely not for the squeamish.  It has a tongue-in-cheek aura about it...but it's what goes past the tongue that really counts.  If you're a gorefest fanatic, this one will totally entertain you.  It is gross, more gross...and quite creepy.  I give the makeup and special effects another 5 stars.  Don't plan on eating breakfast, lunch, dinner...or just a few snacks while watching this.  You may find your stomach in another corner of the room.  All 5 stars!",1317081600,2,520,4.873563218390805
8407465,4,B003WQ3RV8,"Lynch mob involves a cursed town, cannibals, a pedophile Russian torturer, and the mob.
All of the above elements come together in a gore fest with some black humor to it.
The plot revolves around the pedophile torturer, who has been caught by the FBI. In exchange for entry into the witness relocation program, he agrees to turn over the names of all of the mobsters he has worked for. The FBI agents take his information, but because he is such a revolting character, they decide to relocate him to the biggest dump they can find, a small town that just happens to be inhabited by cannibals. In an amusing twist, Weasel survives his first encounters with the locals and manages to convince them to call in the mob as a fresh new food source. Then things get weird.",1288828800,10,766,4.517985611510792
