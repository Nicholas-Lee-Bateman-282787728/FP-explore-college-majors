8094429,5,B000BYRVCU,"Just a word to second the previous reviewer's high estimate of this film, but also to note that it is actually not a Merchant-Ivory production (though it is certainly every bit as good as the Merchant-Ivory standard, and employs two leading performers from Merchant-Ivory's superb version of Forster's A ROOM WITH A VIEW). So, credit where credit is due: The IMDb lists Charles Sturridge as the director and Derek Granger as the producer of this excellent adaptation, with the script credit split three ways between those two gentlemen and a third fellow named Tim Sullivan.",1154476800,6,574,5.052631578947368
8094430,5,B000BYRVCU,"This film is one of those sleeper movies that too many have forgotten about, and yet it is top notch.  First of all, it is faithfully based on Forster's novel of the same title.  Action takes place in both England and Italy, mostly the latter.  There is a mix of emotions, wit, tragedy.  The cast is superb and the acting excellent. Costumes to die for, if you are interested in the Edwardian Age. And, this is a Merchant Ivory film.  Think Howard's End, Room with a View, Remains of the Day, etc.  Lush interiors and exteriors, with plenty of food for thought, this belongs in any period film lovers collection, and a true gem.  Please bring out on DVD, as it is already available in that format in the UK.  Our turn, now!",1131580800,12,723,4.383458646616542
