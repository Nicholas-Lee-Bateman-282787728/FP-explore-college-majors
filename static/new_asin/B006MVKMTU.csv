5006142,2,B006MVKMTU,"While it took me a while to warm up to Matt Smith as the Doctor, I am still a little angry that Steven Moffat writes Doctor Who stories mainly for his children, hence most of what we have seen so far with Matt Smith features kids in the stories. This is not bad as long as it is not overdone, but, come one. This is not what we expected from the man who wrote such classics as ""The Doctor Dances,"" and the two-parter ""Silence In the Library.""
I was quite disappointed in this years' Christmas Special and can't find anything nice to say about it. And, as a Doctor Who fan since 1986, it hurts me to say such a thing. Mr. Moffat, please leave the children out of your future Doctor Who stories.",1329782400,3,693,4.17910447761194
5006143,4,B006MVKMTU,"- Lily (as rocket engines fire): ""What's happening?""
- the Doctor: ""No idea. Do what I do. Hold tight... and pretend it's a plan.""

As sublime as ""A Christmas Carol"" was, it would take something really special for this most recent Doctor Who Christmas Special to match, let alone top, it. I quite liked ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"" because Matt Smith is never less than entertaining. But Steven Moffat's cup of schmaltz really spills over with this episode. But, hey, it's Christmastime, a season ripe for excess, and surely Moffat can be excused for overindulging his inner sappy.

The story opens in outer space as a hostile alien warship menaces Earth. But no sooner do the invaders declare ""People of Earth, you stand alone!"" than the Doctor pops up to gum up the works. But, having once more saved our little ball of mud, the Time Lord plummets down and crashlands in London on Christmas Eve, 1938. In the crater developed by his forced landing, the Doctor finds himself in a bit of a bind, but he's aided by a passing housewife named Madge Arwell (Claire Skinner). The Doctor is so touched by Madge's generosity that he vows to return the favor. ""How?"" she asks. ""I dunno,"" says the Doctor. ""Make a wish, that usually works.""

Cut now to a war-torn London three years later, and to a desolate Christmastime for Madge Arwell. Having just received a telegram informing her of her husband's death under enemy fire, she determines to keep the news from her children, Lily and Cyril, until after the holidays. She promises them: ""This Christmas is going to be the best Christmas ever!"" (And, at this juncture, maybe there's a collective rolling of the eyes from the audience, oh we jaded souls.) To escape the German blitz, the Arwells relocate to Dorset to an uncle's country mansion. There, they're greeted by an odd stranger calling himself the Caretaker. Madge isn't too sure of the Caretaker and the barrage of mad whimsy he unleashes, but the kids take to him right away. Matt Smith comes across as a big kid at heart.

I think I love this sequence best, when ""the Caretaker"" gives the bemused Arwells a frenetic tour of their new home. Hoping to lift up their spirits, the Doctor - c'mon, you knew it was him - had made certain adjustments. I particularly enjoyed how excited the Doctor (and, by extension, Matt Smith) genuinely seemed to be in displaying the various rooms and their singular wares (the locomotive chairs, the lemonade pipeline, the plummeting hammocks, etc.). The kids are soon eyeing a mysterious glowing present wrapped up in blue next to the resplendent Christmas tree.

Moffat doesn't try to disguise his nod towards C.S. Lewis's THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE. And those moments of discovery, encompassed in the first twenty minutes, when the story was still somewhat clinging to the C.S. Lewis bits, make up some of the episode's best moments. Later, once the Doctor and the Arwells employ the ""wardrobe"" and begin to explore the other side's wintry woodsy realm is when I sort of started checking out. I just don't get the logic of harvesting a forest with acid rain. And I don't think Moffat developed the threats of the forest creatures and the harvesters well enough. I did enjoy the neat bit of trivia which references the 5th Doctor's final 1984 adventure (""The Caves of Androzani"").

""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"" ultimately doesn't resonate as strongly as ""A Christmas Carol,"" and yet it's still a fine holiday tale. Claire Skinner delivers a strong performance. She doesn't have so many scenes with Matt Smith, but their interactions are quirky and memorable. Matt Smith shares more scenes with Holly Earl (""Lily""), and it's gratifying that the Doctor doesn't condescend to young Ms. Arwell. He treats her like an adult. Matt Smith is incredible, able to do madcap and then effortlessly carry on with the emotional bits. Moffat has pulled out the stops in terms of tugging on your heart strings (and there's an argument that he may've tugged a bit too hard). It helps that Moffat writes some of the best one-liners in this episode, and many good character moments. It ends on a truly wonderful moment for the lonely Time Lord, one of the few times since DOCTOR WHO's been revived as a television series that the closing credits drop on an absolutely content Doctor. There's probably a plate of fish fingers and custard waiting for him.

The DVD's bonus extras comprise a Prequel to ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"" (00:01:26 minutes) and three ""Best Of"" featurettes (totaling over two hours) which essentially recap Series 5 and 6. As such, these featurettes (each running a bit over 43 minutes) focus on the Eleventh Doctor's top moments, on his Companions, and the Monsters they face. Plenty of clips shown from Series 5 and 6 and, surprisingly, an ensemble of American comedians, actors, musicians, and nerd icons provide fanboy commentary and perspective; Mark Sheppard is the only talking head here who is British and has actually worked on the show. ""The Best of the Monsters"" featurette also comes with ""Ask a Whovian"" segments in which Doctor Who cosplay fans at a convention answer Doctor Who-related questions.",1329523200,15,5198,4.840269966254218
5006144,5,B006MVKMTU,"I am a recent convert to the Whovian phenomena, but I am a quick study, and have acquainted myself with as many of The Doctors as I could.
This simple holiday story finds The Doctor (in his 11th incarnation played by Matt Smith) repaying an act of kindness to a recently widowed woman and her children during The Blitz of the Second World War.

Matt Smith has been a constant delight in his portrayal of The Doctor, who can go from manic delight at the embellishments he's added to an old house, such as bumper-car chairs in the sitting room to a lemonade faucet over the kitchen sink (""I know!""), to somber and poignant as he offers up to the widowed mother his reflections on just why its so important that the children be happy just before they're going to be told the sad news of their RAF Father's demise.

This special offers us a feast for the eyes, as well as a story without any true malevolence or villains. And it is genuinely haertwarming, especially the dinner scene at the end, with The Doctor shedding very heartfelt and humble tears of joy as the special comes to a close.

Now, one might wonder why to purchase this now, when it will, as other reviewers have pointed out, likely be included on the boxed set for the as of this review unaired seventh series.
The answer I can put forth is, the extras. The DVD features three ""Best of..."" retrospectives on the adventures of The Eleventh Doctor thus far, with a wide variety of celebrity guests explaining their love of the show, The Doctor, The Companions, and, of course, The Monsters.",1329436800,5,1552,4.516014234875445

I'm now a big fan and consider him a full-blown Doctor. Story was spot on for Christmas. New widow at Christmas withholds the news about Dad's plane going down in the Channel (WWII)from the two kids so as not to spoil the holiday.

The Doctor, who owed mom a big favor from three years previous, grants her a wish, of sorts, by hyping up Christmas. Turns out to be much, much bigger than planned.

A planet where trees have souls and theres a lighthouse thats also a space ship.  All too soon, mother shows up and shes armed and lethal.  The Doctor (Matt Smith) just needs to get out of the way and let it all happen.

5006167,2,B006MVKMTU,"Matt Smith's second christmas special starts out with him on a ship (which he just blew up), and him jumping into space. Now, this episode has a few good lines, but for the most part, it's ridden with bad acting, bad story writing, bad logic, bad everything.

Now let's take a look at a few things, starting with him jumping out into space: 1. He would have died from the vacume and freezing temperatures before he got the suit on. 2. He wouldn't be able to breath before he got the suit on. 3. In a fall like that he would have been crushed, Time Lord or not.

The mother's acting was REALLY shoddy, especially the crying scenes  (they just weren't convincing).

And flying a GLASS dome through the time vortex? Come on...

Overall, this episode is really bad, but the season following it is pretty good. So stick through it and watch the next season: no matter how much you think Steven Moffat's storylines stink (they usually don't. Check out Blink, The Empty Child & The Doctor Dances, and The Day of the Doctor).

There is a very touching scene at the end, where the Doctor wipes a tear from his eye and looks at it like he's never seen one.

For the episode my rating is actually 1.5 stars, but because it's better than 1, I did two.",1420934400,,1239,4.360869565217391

While I enjoyed it, to a point, the big problem is there is no reason for this story to exist.  Well, I could say that for many of the Christmas specials.  But, really, there was no feeling that this story was anything important, nor interesting, nor part of the structure of the series.  You could easily have NOT made it and nobody would have noticed.  It was not THAT good of a story, Matt Smith was by himself as the Doctor and, frankly, I can't see him supporting scenes without more backup from other strong characters, and you could have replaced these Doctor with any of the other Doctors without a problem.  No, really, Tom Baker could have easily have filled in as the Doctor.  It felt that silly and yet at the same time very bland.  Not very Doctorish if you get my meaning.

Perhaps time & distance from the Potter series will help?!",1368835200,,321,4.8545454545454545
5006213,5,B006MVKMTU,loved it. I am a new fan to Doctor Who and enjoyed the movie.  I was glued to the T watching it,1367193600,,95,3.3181818181818183
5006214,1,B006MVKMTU,"As a piece of cute fantasy television, this might actually rate 3 or 4 stars, but as an episode of Doctor Who, it makes no sense whatsoever. Doctor Who is science fiction, NOT fantasy; and even good fantasy needs to have some internal consistancy, which this one does not have.

The Doctor is a Time Lord .. which, while it means he has certain powers and abilities beyond those of humans, do NOT mean that he's an all powerful superhero.  He cannot survive a fall from space. (In Logopolis he died/regenerated after falling from a tower.  Yet he's supposed to survive a fall from miles up in space, coming out of it with nothing more than a little confusion over a backwards helmet?)
And he is not Willy Wonka, there is no reason for him to create a magical country house, much less a magical 'time portal' to entertain small children. (And no rational explanation for how he was able to do any of this.)

And as for the ending (the first ending ... Magde's 'light' guiding her husband home) ... utterly ludicrous. How exactly did the plane get into the Time Vortex?
The second ending (with Amy and Rory) was merely cloying and pointless.",1365379200,,1139,4.541463414634146
5006215,3,B006MVKMTU,"This story had some good spots in it, but it was definately a filler between seasons.  It didn't seem to be up to the Who standards of lately.",1364860800,,142,4.071428571428571
5006216,5,B006MVKMTU,My family loves doctor who and we were very happy to bee able to get the movie. It is great for any person,1364774400,,106,3.652173913043478
5006217,5,B006MVKMTU,"There are no great Time Lord secrets exposed in this episode, and no brilliant tricks played on the enemies of earth (well, maybe one, but that is over even before the show really starts), no new backstory on the doctor and not much time spent with established favorite characters. The Sonic Screwdriver is even largely irrelevant! So what does it have?

I am having trouble coming up with anything that won't be a spoiler, this story is so quietly rich. So I'll just say that if you don't like to laugh or cry or both at the same time and if you want to miss one of the most delightful and uplifting characters the Doctor has ever worked with, then be sure to skip this one!

A note to those who sometimes find Dr Who way too irreligious: The title and some of the devices and scenery in it are very loosely aligned with the wonderful C.S.Lewis book that this title was a obvious play on, but despite what I see as a strong anti-religious (especially anti-Christian) position (one must remember that that position seems to begin in many intelligent minds as anti-ignorance and anti-hypocracy, and evolves to include anti-[groups that had apparent ignorance and hypocrisy] ideas or else arrises inevitably out of a strict secular humanism dogma) of most Dr Who writers (certainly this one, if you assume the Doctor is in some sense channelling the author's opinions),  I found nothing offensively irreverent in the story (possibly excepting the total omission of Jesus from Christmas ): just humor and pain and healing and beauty and joy.",1362096000,,1538,4.752808988764045
5006218,5,B006MVKMTU,"Good writing, good story. I like how they turn The Lion, The Witch, abd the wardrobe into a Doctor Who adventure. If you are a Doctor Who fan, you won't be disappointed.",1361750400,,169,4.3125
5006219,4,B006MVKMTU,I really enjoyed this Christmas special mostly because it was just him and he was at his best.  This was a good one!,1361318400,,116,4.043478260869565
5006220,5,B006MVKMTU,"The wonder of Doctor. Who is found through the eyes of a child when the Dr. spends Christmas at an old manor and of course spruces it up a bit.

The Doctor is very whimsical at Christmas and his present is one of the best I could think of to give someone if you are an interdemensional timey-whimey space traveler.

The wonder of what The Doctor must see every day is really shown well here.

Also, never, mess with the momma.

The ending brings a tear to my eye and I've watched it several times.

5006233,4,B006MVKMTU,"It's Christmas Eve and war with Hitler looms. Madge Orwell is biking home in the dark when a man falls out of the sky. She aims to help him, but needs to stop at home, first, to tell her husband and kids where she's going. She tells her son, Cyril, ""Listen, Cyril, tell him [his father] that I've borrowed Mr. Goldsmith's car; that I've found a spaceman in a field, possibly an angel. But he's injured and I can't get his helmet off. So I'm having to take him into town to find a policeman phone box.""

Of course, the spaceman is The Doctor and the phone box is the TARDIS. And the Doctor is grateful, and plans on repaying Madge for her kindness.

Skip to three years later, Christmas Eve again. WWII is on for the British, and Madge receives the dreaded telegram. Her husband, an RAF pilot, has been lost when his plane disappeared over the English Channel. Madge can't tell Cyril and his sister, Lily, right away - it will ruin Christmas Eve for them forever. So the three of them troop to a mansion in the country. Unfortunately, when they arrive, they find that the only person there is the caretaker. Who is the Doctor!

He's set up a marvelous visit for them, including a beautiful Christmas tree and one giant wrapped present for Cyril, waiting to be opened Christmas morning. That night, Cyril sneaks down to take a peek at his present. It is really an opening into another world! I have to wonder, what WAS the Doctor thinking?!

Cyril, Lily and the Doctor go through, and then, so does the worried Madge. And they will experience wonders they couldn't have imagined. As Madge says, at one point, ""One can't imagine being a forest, and then, suddenly one can.""

The ending is lovely, for both Madge, Cyril and Lily, and for the Doctor, too. ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"" doesn't have quite the emotional punch of 2010's ""A Christmas Carol"", but it is still inventive and fun. And the Doctor is pretty typical: ""Do what I do. Hold tight and pretend it's a plan!""

I get such a kick out of Madge. She is that stereotypical Britisher. On one hand, she is able to take all things strange in stride, because she has such a strong sense of self. On the other hand, that strong sense of self also means that no matter what happens, she always acts the same and she doesn't change because of finding something new.

Special Features for the DVD of ""The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe"".
Specials 2, 3 and 4 are very similar and filmed at the same time. They consist of flim clips from Seasons 5 and 6 of Doctor Who, along with commentary by many Who enthusiasts. Commentators include: Chris Hardwick (host Nerdist podcast), Scott Adsit (actor, comedian), Alison Haislip (actress, G4 correspondent), Paul F. Tompkins (actor, comedian), Eugene Mirman (comedian, actor), Reggie Watts (muscian, comedian), Hugh Douglas (former NFL defensive end, radio personality), Danielle Harris (actress), Mark Sheppard (actor), Adam Rogers (editor Wired magazine), Amanda Palmer (musician), Scott Ian (musician), Natalie Morales (actress).

Each of specials 2, 3 and 4, emphasize a particular part of Doctor Who. I liked them because they didn't just remind me of the story-lines of Dr. Who episodes. The commentators analyzed the stories and the characters, and pointed out some things I hadn't thought of on my own.

1. ""The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe Prequel"" (2 minutes) This is a preview trailer for the Christmas special

2. ""The Best of the Doctor"" (56 minutes) This set concentrates on the Doctor, what he is and how he ticks. Subtopics are: ""The Eleventh Doctor Revealed"", ""The Doctor Confronts the Atraxi"", ""The Doctor and the Daleks in WWII"", ""The Doctor and the Pandorica"" (All the Doctor's enemies over time have gathered in the sky, and he speaks, ""Just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you. And then - and THEN - do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.""),
""The Doctor and the Vortex Manipulator"", ""The Doctor and Vincent Van Gogh"", ""The Doctor and the Astronaut"", ""The Doctor Visits the Oval Office"", ""The Doctor Meets the TARDIS"" (with one of my favorite interchanges: ""You didn't always take me where I wanted to go!"" - ""No, but I always took you where you needed to go."")
""The Doctor Goes to War""

3. ""The Best of the Companions"" (51 minutes) Amy, Rory and River. How they started and evolved during the two seasons. River first appeared in the Season 4 episode, ""Silence in the Library"", but that was really just a teaser, and isn't covered here. Chris Hardwick covers the importance of the companions, ""If you were the last of your kind, and you were roaming around the universe, you would need someone to keep you sane. Or at least to fire jokes off of.""
Subtopics: ""Young Amelia Pond Waits for the Doctor"" (with that infamous and totally typical line: ""Give me five minutes. I'll be right back."" And, 12 years later, Pond's furious rejoinder: ""Twelve years! And four psychiatrists."")
""Amy Saves the Android Inventor"", ""River Sends a Unique Message"", ""Rory Confronts the Doctor"", ""Amy in the Dream World"", ""Amy Trapped With a Weeping Angel"", ""Rory Consumed By the Crack"", ""River Breaks Out of Storm Cage"", ""Centurion Rory Protects Amy"" (Could I do that? I love my husband, but could I wait outside a box with nothing to occupy my mind, for 2,000 years?"")
""The Companions Murdered"", ""River's Romance With the Doctor"" (Commentator: ""Forget about star-crossed lovers. They're time-crossed lovers.""), ""Amy's Pregnancy Revealed"", ""Amy and Baby at War"".

4. ""The Best of the Monsters"" (44 minutes) Monsters here refers to everything the Doctor must best, including non-creatures such as ""The Crack"" and ""The Pandorica"".
Subtopics: ""The Daleks"", ""Prisoner Zero"", ""The Dream Lord"" (As one commentator says: ""You want to be [the Doctor's] buddy. but at the same time, there are horrendous things that lurk in him, that you should be afraid of.""),
""The Weeping Angels"", ""The Neighbor Upstairs"", ""The Silurians"", ""The Silence"", ""The Siren"", ""The Gangers"" (haunting as well as creepy), ""The Headless Monks"", ""The Crack"", ""The Pandorica"".

All in all, enjoyable extras for an enjoyable Christmas special.

5006234,5,B006MVKMTU,"Doctor Who Christmas Specials are always fun.  You generally don't need to know all of the last years continuity to follow them and they give a little extra for casual as well as faithful Who followers.  This one was not as poignant as last years Christmas Carol but a good kids tale that grown ups will like also.  Matt Smith has made the role his own even though I am still partial to David Tennant as far as the ""New"" Doctors are concerned.

5006236,5,B006MVKMTU,In all honesty I have not seen ALL the doctors on their own yet. Yes I've seen the 3 doctors & 5 doctors. But I can'believe Sylvester McCoy was as bad as I have heard on TV specials. But from what I have seen Matt Smith (in my opinion) edges out David tennant as the best. As for Christopher Eccleston what happened in GI JOE? While Peter Davison continues to age like a fine wine. But Matt is something special.

I'm giving the 1-star for Amazon's deceptive product description for the DVD.  Amazon's product description FOR THE DVD is as follows: ""Doctor Who Confidential - An inside look at the 2010 Doctor Who Christmas Special Doctor Who at the Proms - Concert performance of music from Doctor Who recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall during the BBC's annual Proms concerts.""

Guess what's NOT on the DVD version?  Yep, you guessed it, the Doctor Who Confidential.  If the Confidential was only on the Blu-ray, then why was it listed in the production description for the DVD?

The Doctor, who is supposed to be the lead character after all, does almost nothing in this story and it just seems to all happen around him.  The story has little or no plot and is really just eye-candy.  Very beautiful to watch but not much story to follow.  Not even a villain for the hero to battle.  It was as if the writer said ""let's just make a pretty story for the kids to watch on Christmas"".  Well the kids and most fans of the show would like a little more, especially after all of the other wonderful Doctor Who Christmas specials that have come out over the years.
