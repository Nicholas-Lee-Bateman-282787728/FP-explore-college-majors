8594458,5,B00DMDE04E,"Joe Piscopo sings, dances and acts his way into our hearts as a down & out drunk who owes the mob money. To save his life he agrees to produce a musical and he must include other degenerates who also owe money to the mob. FBI agent Erich Bergen is fantastic and has a truly amazing voice! Paul Sorvino (""Paulie"" from Goodfellas) is hysterical and can really sing opera! Outstanding acting by the entire fabulous cast:  Erika Christensen, Eddie Griffin, Michael Pare, Steven Chase, Steven Bailey, Louis Lombardi, and Victoria Summer (sings like an angel), and the list goes on! It's about time for a feel-good movie with some catchy songs thrown in! LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!!",1377216000,4,677,4.737288135593221
