2216149,2,B0007KZQ9S,"A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.

With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.

A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself.",1119052800,,1636,5.078066914498141
2216150,4,B0007KZQ9S,"While many new writers search for bizarre story material as subject for action thrillers, few have looked to the scariest source of all - St John's Book of Revelation from the Bible.  So it is from the pen of Luc Besson ('The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc', 'The Transporter', 'La Femme Nikita') adapting a screenplay from the novel 'Les Rivires pourpres' by Jean-Christophe Grang that we gain some visualization of the predictions of the Apocalyptic end of the world.  And it is as scary as you remember from reading the Bible as a child!

Commissioner Niemans (Jean Reno) partners with Reda (Benot Magimel - the hunky fine actor from 'The Piano Teacher' and 'The Flower of Evil') to investigate a series of crucifixions linked to a near secret abbey.  Because of the ecclesiastic nature of the murders a church scholar Marie (Camille Natta) is called in to advise and it is with her skills as an expert on Revelation that she teaches Niemans and Reda the meanings of the breaking of the various Seals, the four horsemen, the events leading up to the prophesied end of the world, and provides the intellectual backup to the thriller chase sequences attempting to apprehend the monks posing as Angels of the Apocalypse provided by Niemans and Reda.  Add to this mix the fact that the Abbey is connected to the Maginot Line from WW II and that a German entrepreneur Heinrich von Garten (Christopher Lee) has for some odd reason purchased the Abbey for this own secret agenda and all of the ingredients for a edge of the seat suspense movie are in place.

Reno and Magimel make a terrific screen team with just the right amount of humanism and humor to allow some tension relief for he story.  The special effects are excellent as is the cinematography and musical score.  Yes, there is considerable blood and guts as each of the 'surrogate apostles' is murdered, but the camera doesn't linger longer than necessary to make the point.

The problem with the film is that it runs out of steam in the end and gives the feeling that someone called ""Cut"" making story end far too abruptly.  But other than that this is a fairly interesting enactment of the Biblical prophecy of the Apocalypse, updated (?) for the audiences of today!  Grady Harp, May 05",1116720000,,2252,4.690355329949239
2216151,5,B0007KZQ9S,"The second in what I sincerely hope will be a continuing series about a French Police Inspector who specializes in solving wierd murders, this is an extraordinarily well-made film produced by the partnership of Canal Plus, Luc Besson, Johnny Halliday, and Jean Reno, who stars as inspector Niemans.  This time out Inspector Niemans is called on to investigate the ritualistic killing of a group of religious zealots.

Like the novel ""The da Vinci Code"", the script blends Apocalyptic Christian mysticism, neo-Nazis with grandiose dreams, forensic realism, and a buncha good ol' bad boys dressed in cassocks and hoods who hurtle around committing highly athletic mega violent crimes... while hyped to the gills on WWII vintage methamphetamine.

The director, Olivier Dahan, knows his action-movie stuff.  There's a foot-chase that runs two minutes plus and rivals in intensity any digitally-pumped-up work that Hollywood has done recently... and a hand-to-hand combat sequence between a dope-dealer and a young policeman that should have the heads of every martial arts afficianado in the audience enthusiastically nodding, ""Yes! Yes! Yes!""

The only quibble?  The well-plotted story ends too abruptly.",1112400000,,1201,5.53551912568306
2216152,2,B0007KZQ9S,"Stories about murders and serial killers have always intrigued millions of film viewers through films such as Peeping Tom (1960), Silence of the Lambs (1991), and Se7en (1995).  These films often go into great lengths to depict the psyche and the persona of the characters through the killer's hideous acts, which often generates discomfort and disgust.  Nonetheless, the audience continues to watch in suspense trying to anticipate what will happen next.  Crimson Rivers - Angels of the Apocalypse brings the audience into a visual journey that triggers this macabre interest, but leaves the audience annoyed and empty.

Detective Pierre Niemans (Jean Reno) returns to the criminal environment in this sequel to the Crimson Rivers (2000).  This time a monk in a monastery has discovered blood seeping out of a wall, which initially seems to be a pious sign from God.  However, Detective Niemans arrives to investigate the seemingly spiritual discovery, as he uncover a freshly crucified body within the wall.  The body sets off an investigation of a deliberately meticulous killer with strong Christian values that seem to be one step ahead of Detective Niemans'.

Simultaneously, Reda (Benot Magimel), a former student of Detective Niemans when he was a professor at the police academy, is coming across a peculiar man who looks and calls himself Jesus.  For some reason, someone dressed as a monk attempts to kill the man who calls himself Jesus.  Reda tries to arrest the unknown monk, but the monk has unbelievable strength and stamina and escapes Reda's attempt to capture him.

The circumstances bring the student and his teacher back together, as they obtain help from an expert on Christianity and Christian text, Detective Marie (Camille Natta).  The three of them begin an investigative journey covered with blood and Christian symbols, which they must deifier in order to get closer to the killer.  The clues lead them closer to the suspect, but not without putting their own lives in jeopardy as it seems that the killer is a highly trained murderer.

Crimson Rivers begins with an interesting premise with a gruesome murder in a monastery; however, as the story moves along the audience is introduced to new facts which make much of the film seem rather dimwitted and awkward.  It feels as if the director did not completely think through his ideas before presenting them to the audience or that he began working with a script that only was in the draft stage.  There is definitely potential in the story, but it all falls apart through the new facts and a painful awareness of what will happen next.",1112400000,7,2614,5.016203703703703

2216154,2,B0007KZQ9S,"'Crimson Rivers -- Angels of the Apocalypse' ('Les Rivieres Pourpres 2: Les Angels de L'Apocalypse') has little to do with the first one except that the new film has Inspector Niemans played by Jean Reno, the star of the original.  Instead of Vincent Cassel, the task of his partner is given to Benoit Magimel, and the script is written by Luc Besson, known for 'The Fifth Element.'  Perhaps more interesting are the names of the guest stars, Johnny Hallyday ('The Man on the Train') and, look,  legendary Christopher Lee, Count Dracula, or Saruman of 'LOTR.'

The story is the original of Besson, which means nothing original.  A dead body of a man is found in the 'Room No 13.' of one secluded monastery, and the way of burial is, as you see, nothing ususal, like a cat in Poe's famous story.  While tough detective Niemans investigates the case, mysterious killer(s?) keep on murdering the victims according to their own  rituals.

Before a younger cop Reda (Magimel, very good) joins in Niemans's investigation, following the suspect of another strange case, we know where the film is going to lead us.  The film's mystery includes, as the title suggests, a biblical theme, and it is not hard to guess the motives of the serial killing.  And when Christopher Lee appears as a minister of Germany (he is playing a German), and talks about the days of WW2, now you know Besson is not the most creative writer in the world.

[MAKES ME DIZZY] The film is directed by Olivier Dahan, whose previous works I have not seen yet.  But obviously he does not like the time-tested, traditional method of filmmaking, and seems to have refused to use storyboards.  In short, the entire film looks like a 100 minute MTV show, French version.

The images of the film are always restless, as if trying to test our patience.  The camera often shows slanted picture, and whenever it wants, it starts to rotate without particular meaning.  Though unique places (like Maginot Line) are additional merits to the banal story, and the dark, dump, atmosphere of the place is very realistic, these precious moments are scatterd among the pointless and thrill-less script that offers no interest except blood and body count.

Some of the stunts are memorable, the chase scene between Maginel's cop and the high-jumping assassin in particular.  Whoever he or she may be, the stunt deserves special mention.  But alas, the director meddles with the stuntperson's great job, with cut, cut, cut, and the silly camerawork that, I firmly believe, should be banned in making any action parts in future.  And poor editing (which reminded me of the streetcar chase scenes of 'The Rock' which gave me a headache).  Sometimes I cried, 'What's going on?'

Reno and Magimel are good, but the acting is not their best, and the same can be said about the legendary actor Lee.  And the run-of-the-mill story of Besson, who has written as many as three scripts in 2003 alone, needs a more twisted plot, like that of the original, and what a disappointing ending, which makes no sense whatever.  Though there are some fleetingly exciting moments, the flat and incredibly convinient conclusion would exactly tell you why Besson can write so many screenplays.",1110153600,19,3215,4.846153846153846
2216155,2,B0007KZQ9S,"On the one hand we have some mysterius murders taking place. People with the same names and occupations as Jesus'disciples are being murdered, and obviously there is a connection. (Actually they seem to confuse Peter's occupation, and I don't know which tradition they found some of the others in, but never mind. These are minor problems.) On the other hand we have the mysterious monks who kill with the determination of ninjas, look like the killer in Scream, and fights like someone in Matrix. Add to this a guy who lokes like Jesus (the Jesus on the paintings I might add, hardly the historical Jesus) who is hit by a car and put in a bed in hospital. Enter the police that will sort everything out.

There are many things that are well done here. The music is rather good (maybe not memorable, but it works quite well), the special effects are fine, the acting is good, and so on and so forth. The basic problem is the story. It's not interesting. It's supposed to be mysterious, but although there is a kind of religious light shining through the window in pseudo-Jesus' hospital room, and his ""disciples"" are callously killed by the mysterious ninja-scream-matrix-monks it's hard to be very worked up when you don't have a clue about what is going on. Who are these guys, to start with? We don't know anything about either the pseudo-Jesus and disciples-guys or the killer monks-people. And we don't know why they are killing people or anything. Are they looking for something? Is it about revange? No, it's all a big ""mystery"". But the thing about a mystery is that you understand *something*, so you can be interested in the parts you don't understand.

The style oscillates between mystery/detective-story and action. That may sound more interesting than it is. It's not a complete turkey either, just a rather uninteresting and directionless blend of odd religious ideas, symbols, and who knows what... that just might dissolve into something else (also rather uninspiring) when the police are done. It's a sad thing that the Crimson Rivers (which was a good film) gets a sequel like this.

A last note. When I rented this DVD the backside said that someone had found a body with DNA that matched the DNA of Jesus. Of course one wonders how they did compare, but actually nothing of the kind happens in the film. (Probably it was for the better in the film, but it make you wonder who writes the backsides.)",1108857600,6,2419,4.7274881516587675

2216161,2,B0007KZQ9S,"""Crimson Rivers: The Angels of the Apocalypse,"" directed by Olivier Dahan, is the 2004 sequel to the 2000 movie Crimson Rivers.

""The Angels of the Apocalypse,"" as in the first movie, stars French superstar actor Jean Reno as the supercop Niemans, but Vincent Cassel, his sidekick from the first movie is AOL, and is substituted for by Benoit Magimel, as the young cop Rada, who comes to Reno's assistance in finding the gruesome murder of the ""12 Apostles.""

The movie starts with Niemans investigating a body, nailed to a cross, and found in the wall of a French monastery, As in the first movie, Rada is investigating a seemingly unrelated incident of a customs clerk in a French airport who is also nailed, like Christ, to his office wall by a homicidal monk. The poor victim was abducted while eating a homemade meal out of a plastic container, which, no matter which way you nail it, can't be too good for his stomach.

Then, after returning with two fellow cops from a stake out, Rada's car is run into by some kook, dressed like Jesus Christ, who seemed to be out for a late night jog. Rada admits the maniac to the hospital, and when he returns to visit him the next day, he spots a hooded Monk about to do bad things to the fake Jesus.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joe-Bruno-s-Mobsters-Six-Volume-Set/dp/B009CGA74M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joe Bruno's Mobsters - Six Volume Set</a>

The ensuing chase scene is reminiscent of one in the first ""Crimson Rivers"" movie. In a five minute tension-filled sequence, Rada, obviously in great shape himself, chases the monk over rooftops, through crowded streets, into a warehouse and even on top of a moving train. But the crazed monk has speed of an Olympic sprinter, the strength of a weightlifter and the agility of a monkey. He finally escapes by doing a back-flip off a roof. Rada runs to the edge of the roof, expecting to see a splattered body, but instead sees the monk sprinting the 100-yard dash to safely.

Now here's where the movie goes totally off the tracks.

Rada returns to the hospital and find out that the Jesus nut actually has the same DNA as the real Jesus Christ. So Rada and Niemans join forces, as they did in the first movie, but this time to catch a covey of murderous monks, who bolt about like kangaroos on speed, which in fact, is almost exactly what they are on, to achieve their acrobatic abilities.

The two detectives are joined by a female sleuth Marie (Camille Natta), who has an advanced degree in religious studies. But she is little more than window dressing to a movie that needs all the help it can get.

A gray-bearded Christoper Lee, as a German aristocrat obviously up to no good, adds spice to the performances. Yet even the ominous presence of Lee does little to catapult this flick past the improbable to almost the impossible.

There's a few nice action sequences, but the final scene drags, and when the movie is over, you'll breath a sigh of release and wonder what exactly was it that you just saw anyway.

The film critics basically panned ""Crimson Rivers: The Angels of the Apocalypse,"" and with good reason.

Christopher Null, of filmcritic.com wrote, ""There aren't many French movies you can rightly consider as guilty pleasures, except the original 'Crimson Rivers', a baffling, yet highly entertaining thriller that has become a cult favorite. I wish I could say as much about the sequel, which is pretty much nonsense from the first frame. Before the end, the mystery will entwine Nazis, amphetamine addicts, creepy dudes in robes and, uh, the Maginot Line. Nudge me if you get it.""

David Nussair of Reel Film reviews was kinder to the movie's crew, but not much, ""The movie is punctuated with a number of engrossing, downright thrilling action sequences, and director Olivier Dahan's penchant for over-the-top visuals certainly elevates one's interest on an all-too-periodic basis. In the end, however, the movie relentless baffling modus operandi cements its place as a hopelessly muddled and downright interminable mess.""

I highly recommended the original ""The Crimson Rivers,"" giving it a solid 4 stars out of a possible 5. But ""Crimson Rivers: The Angels of the Apocalypse,"" is not in the first movies' class, and even the presence of the indomitable Reno fails to raise the movie past barely enjoyable.

Grudgingly, I give ""Crimson Rivers: The Angels of the Apocalypse,"" a shaky 2  stars, and only because the actions sequences really are awe-inspiring, even though the plot revolving around it, is more jumbled than President Obama's economic policies.",1290124800,,4614,4.950840879689522

After watching Crimson Rivers a number of times, I was hoping the sequal would live up to the mystery and rich character formation of the original movie. None of us are really surprised when a sequal is disappointing, but we keep hoping.

The charm of the two protagonists in Crimson is completely missing in the sequal. I think the english dubbing of the sequal lacks the spark of the original when Max and Piere are drawn into unplanned acceptance, collabortaion and friendship . The original English dubbing voices, so vital in the character development are replaced in the sequal by spiritless, work a day replacements. Why didn't they use the same voices? Probably cost had much to do with it.

Well the sequal tries to approximate the cold, dreay moodiness of winter with the hard to believe subteranean foolishness of abandoned Maginot fortifications. No one could possibly outclimb the impending flood of water in the escape shaft by two out of shape smokers,as is used in the climax of apocalypse.

The demons referred to by Judith's mother in Crimson have put their mark on the sequal. Let's hope that a third try might be blessed with the virtues of the original and the elemination of faults in the sequal.",1277942400,,1244,4.826291079812207

Whilst investigating a bizarre murder inside an ancient monastery, two detectives (Jean Reno and Benot Magimel) stumble on a series of killings related to a mysterious cult and its charismatic leader (Christopher Lee).

Olivier Dahan's stylish sequel (cf. the original CRIMSON RIVERS, 2000) sacrifices the original film's emotional content for a series of intense set-pieces, which mutes the intended effect. The visceral impact is formidable, and the Gothic visuals are a treat, but it fails to work on anything but the most superficial level, and Reno seems to be coasting on auto-pilot. Magimot is one of France's sexiest and most talented young actors, and he steals the film from his high-profile co-stars, though Lee is given little to do, and his presence fails to ignite the expected sparks.

Cassel made a good partner for Reno in the first movie and I would have preferred he had been in this one as well. Cassel did better when he was on his own and he had chemistry when he was with Reno. It would have also given a little more credence to it being a sequel.

A group of religious men hiding from Nazis that work out of a monastery with underground tunnels to Marginot bunkers was not quite as intrigueing as the serial killer at a university in the mountains. Mainly I think because Crimson Rivers was made to be a murder mystery and it did a great job of dropping clues that you could follow. This movie is more like something thrown together and tries very hard for intense action and not enough on the mystery.

I remember Jean Reno from ""the Professional"" which I really liked, otherwise the description of Crimson was not enough to convince me to watch. I am GLAD I did watch! It's a very enjoyable film. The description on the cover and on most reviews I've seen left me thinking this was just another in a long long list of tales in this genre. And it is that -- then again it's much more than that. AND, there are more than enough SURPISES to keep even a cynic like me interested. I watched it again right away -- had to, really, because...

The movie is far easier to watch if you are fluent in French, which I am not. Like all native English-speaking people, I find that Europeans speak a lot faster than do Americans. In Crimson, the actors speak at a very natural pace in fine French. Because it's subtitled in English, however, that makes it impossible to keep up BECAUSE it's also an ACTION movie so that you need to focus first on the action, yet there's a lot of dialogue that you need to read -- and the dialogue is in no way superfluous. That is to say, the dialogue IS important.

Still, it's a VERY GOOD MOVIE, just be aware that you will frequently be reversing the DVD to pick up on many things BECAUSE there are nuances and a surprise or three tucked in there, which also is a GOOD thing. For example, near the very beginning there's something many viewers will find very 'interesting' -- though different people will assign different things to it -- but you'll be reading subtitles, and only catch a hint of it later deep in the movie, which means at some point you may want to go back (It took me 'til the very end of the movie to realize I thought maybe there was 'something' in that scene and then I went back, but even then I needed the dialogue to 'see' what was happening, and I had to watch that scene about a dozen times to be sure what I was seeing. Then again, YOU might very well 'get' it right away! LOL But I doubt it)

*Much as I enjoy the movie I feel a duty to advise you that the translations used in the subtitles frequently are not even close to the French being spoken in the movie. A very well-scripted film like Crimson gets hobbled a bit by a number of poor translations.

ENJOY the movie, allow some extra time for doubling back to pick up on some very interesting things you didn't quite 'get'.

(The reason I put that note at the top is: I am very detail-oriented, so that the less detail-oriented YOU are, the less you will notice any of the things that I took issue with)",1130889600,12,2698,4.259765625
2216174,3,B0007KZQ9S,"The first Crimson Rivers film is pretty entertaining and beautifully filmed; this sequel's plot and the murky production values hobble an otherwise entertaining film.

The story revolves around a series of religiously-themed murders, and a secret cabal of monks. The plot is straight from a Captain America comic book (minus the Red Skull).

If you can get a used copy or rent one, then this film is worth a look.",1125619200,4,413,4.885714285714286
2216175,3,B0007KZQ9S,"CR2 is like a hollywood movie in French. Sure it's corny, but it's entertaining.  Reno is great (as always). It's nice to see Lee speak French (even though I doubt it's his voice.) If you need an entertaining thrill, than CR2 is it.",1122076800,,232,4.395348837209302
2216176,3,B0007KZQ9S,"I'll first say, I didn't catch the first ""Crimson Rivers,"" so I don't know if I'm missing something important, other than Jean Reno's character once taught at a police academy and doesn't like dogs.

Inspector Niemans is called to investigate the death of a monk whose abbey is located next to the Maginot Line. His investigation leads him into the world of a religious sect who seem to mimick Jesus and his apostles. And someone is whacking them off, one by one.

The direction of the movie seems confused and scattered. Occasionally there are some great moments, following by sheer chaos and a befuddled conclusion. For the most part, I enjoyed the camerawork and the musical score is wonderful. Acting is secure and competent in the hands of Reno, Christopher Lee, and Benot Magimel, but as a group, there seems to be little real chemistry between any of them.

But I really was scratching my head a few times, like how could a car take a hundred rounds of bullets and not explode? I don't know what reference they had about the apostles' occupation, but none were shellfish fishermen, because shellfish are unkosher. And what's wrong with a dry white wine in that part of France? And what was the deal with the English subtitles? It had no matches with the spoken English!

OK, so it's a little weird at times, but it's worth the watch.

P.S.: I loved that joke at the beginning of the scene where Reda first meets ""Jesus;"" ""seven ate nine."" Just watch it, you'll get it.",1119571200,3,1475,4.636015325670498

As usual, great movie and plot.  This is a movie about how people get too caught up in their beliefs to the point that they do things that almost destroy them, and the plot of others taking advantage of their weakness, great mature family viewing",1409961600,,408,4.2727272727272725
8047861,3,B0007KZQ9S,"The original Crimson Rivers (Les rivieres pourpres) was made for the French market and so had French subtitles.  The Angels of the Apocalypse was made for the American market and hence did NOT have French subtitles.  As a French speaker, although as a third language, French subtitles would have assisted with better understanding of the French dialog.

As for the movie itself, the cinematography, the acting, and the plot line (just to name a few) were poor rip-offs of other films about the Holy Grail, and other religious mythology legends.  The entire film was riddled with phony symbolism.  Jean Reno is an excellent actor but his and others' efforts were wasted on this film.  It IS suspenseful, but blatantly phony.",1385942400,,723,4.983333333333333
8047862,2,B0007KZQ9S,"I am a big Jean Reno fan. This movie, however, was over the top. The plot jumps and very hard to follow. Plenty of action but you tend to loose interest after viewing it for a short period of time. It's one of those type of movies you look forward to the end. In the case for this movie it couldn't end soon enough. I currently am waiting for the dvd ""The Crimson Rivers"", the first one made in this possible series. Hopefully this original will be better then it's sequel.",1379289600,,473,4.208791208791209
