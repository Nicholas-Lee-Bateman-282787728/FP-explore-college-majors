1639270,1,B00005O5JO,"Contrary to what too many people told me, George Washington has to be the most over-hyped piece of listless boredom to grace art houses without subtitles.  Even through the film is less than 90 minutes, my ... felt like it sat through three hours of a movie.
While the cinematography is a notch above most low budget indie films, it's such a crutch for the lack of a clear storyline. I'm still not sure why the kids didn't call 911 when their friend dies - how do they know the kid is dead? And why doesn't anyone notice the living kid running around town in the dead kid's athletic suit?  And the business with the dog hating guy who turns the pet into a hat was like a bad David Lynch moment. If anything, David Gordon Green created a spoof of a Terrence Malick film - anytime he needs to cover the plot holes, he does a cut away to some piece of debris or has a character give a flake filled voiceover.  And why was the director talking to his actor about Lloyd Free at the end.  What was the deal with the aimless two minute scene of the guy riding the motorscooter that has the music change in the middle? What a waste.",1030233600,9,1124,4.213953488372093
1639271,5,B00005O5JO,"I first saw George Washington on the Independent Film Channel. Actually, made it a point to get up early to watch this fil after seeing some advertisement about it.
The movie is beautiful.
Melancholy, sad, full of perfect imagery that tells the tale. I would agree this movie is not for everyone.
George Washington takes awhile to get into. The plot is dragged out but this film is worth the time to sit through and do more then just sit watching it as another film. There are many little pieces to this one, some not as forth right as the others but it offers great viewing and craftmanship which has become some of the most prominent forces i nthe film industry.
Do not expect anything glamorous or Hollywoodish frim this film. It is a bare bones raw film which great human tragedy.
Another Independent Film which now takes it's place with pride on my DVD shelf.",1029801600,3,864,4.544871794871795
1639272,3,B00005O5JO,"George Washington is beautifully photographed. The colors are vivid and saturated, and the framing is excellent. Occasionally the cinematography is distracting, with jarring zooms and pans. But for the most part, it's a delight to watch.
The plot is barely there, and that made it a little hard to watch. 89 minutes is a long time to look at pretty pictures with very little story. The acting is a mixed bag; some performances are convincing, some are artificial. If you're looking for a movie where something happens, this isn't it. It's mostly a loosely-strung collection of thought-provoking imagery.",1021248000,2,603,5.163265306122449
1639273,5,B00005O5JO,"I liked _George Washington_.  It is a beautiful film that follows a group of adolescent children one summer in North Carolina.  The languorous mood, and gorgeous cinematography, along with the non-professional cast, creates a sense of pathos in the viewer.  I wish more movies of this caliber were made.",1007164800,,303,5.142857142857143
1639274,3,B00005O5JO,"'George Washington' can feel like dutiful viewing, something you know is probably good for your moral and cultural health, like public service broadcasting.  Like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' wrenched from its comfortable, white middle-class perspective, 'George' sacrifices realism to mood.  We get many images of poverty and abandonment, of scrapyards, rusted debris, impoverished lots, rank public lavatories, delapidated houses, unemployment, but never any insight into how these things came about, beyond the odd photograph of the first President Bush.  Furthermore, this poverty and decay isn't real, felt poverty and decay, but absurdly fetishised in gorgeously over-composed tableaux, where the bright glare of the sun seems to suffuse these meticulous long shots with glowing aureoles.  this langorous summer atmosphere, the prevalence of mangy animals, the often excruciatingly precocious, cod-poetic voiceover, the 'mature', coffee-table-serious soundtrack, all bespeak a Harper Lee-style moral earnestness wrapped up in a sandwich bag of aestheticism.  Even a deserted, bloody corpse looks pretty.
what makes 'George' at all watchable, even enjoyable, is the cast.  there is a mendacious assumption in some critical quarters that the use of non-professionals in film is somehow superior to and more honest than trained actors, with their tics, tricks and evasions.  Amateurs couldn't be less 'real', their stumbling self-consciousness resulting in a stiltedness that has little to do with everyday life.  What non-professionals bring is an awareness of the camera, an acknowledgement professionals try to hide.  We watch amateurs performing beng 'real', and the best scenes here are not the moody, poetic ones of strained solitude, but the sequences of interaction, with the characters kidding around, trying to stage their own self-image, or the image they want to project.  This results in some surprisingly funny moments, especially when George becomes a superhero, his cape and dogskin/racoon hat jarring against the rundown environment; but it also brings you so close to the characters, that you feel an unheard-of visceral identification with them, especially when bad things happen.  A constant motif through the film is of light filtering through  racks and gaps - for me this light emanates from the wonderful actors rather than the poverty-chic mise-en-scene.",1006128000,13,2377,5.721590909090909
1639275,4,B00005O5JO,"I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000, and thought it one of the most original and haunting films I have seen in years. It is a very subjective, impressionistic and almost transcendental movie about a group of kids, and how they follow their own particular code of honour in the face of misfortune. Kind of like Harmony Korine but at an easier pace, and with more unity of vision.",999993600,9,397,4.4520547945205475
1639335,4,B00005O5JO,How many films have really taken time to get inside the minds of southern small town black children?  I can't think of one. The fact that nothing really happens in the first hour somehow makes it all that much more fascinating how completely unprepared they are to deal with what happens next.  It's amazing how little time they spend thinking about racism until the oldest boy piles one mistake on top of another.  An uncle foreshadows how panic and dread can create the worst possible outcome.  This shows the exact moment kids become responsible for their actions.,1383091200,,567,4.814432989690721
1639336,5,B00005O5JO,I had to watch this movie for class and write a report on it. This is a very reasonable price and is very convenient,1361923200,,116,3.875
1639337,5,B00005O5JO,"I first came to know of David Gordon Green from how crappy his recent movies have been by reading online reviews.  However, what interested me enough to buy all of his early movies is that almost every single reviewer - really - was aghast at what they considered to be the next great American director creating such recent crap.

These reviewers in particular mentioned the movie George Washington as his great movie.  I then purchased all of his early movies and I making my way through them, and they are great movies.

This movie was Green's first full-length and it is a beautiful, artistic, engrossing, tragic and ultimately relatable movie.  The term Southern Gothic gets tossed around so much that it does not have much meaning anymore, and the most that people can say about these movies that they ""aspire"" to be Southern Gothic.  George Washington is Southern Gothic - it is that simple.

What I was most struck by is the familiarity Green had with every aspect of this movie.  From the decayed and dangeroud industrial sets and scenes, the unsupervised innocent children at play, the interaction of those in these towns that live to get by and little more.  This was a beautiful story in Green's head from many pieces of his life that he made into a whole and complete narrative in this movie, and one gets the sense that like Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, this was a story that Green had been wanting to tell for some time.

A beautiful movie and great enought to deservedly be in the Criterion Collection.",1350259200,,1520,4.659176029962547
1639338,4,B00005O5JO,"This movie is definitely more about character development than advancing the plot at any cost, and it pays off.  I kept thinking about specific scenes in it for many days afterwards, recognizing certain connections long after the movie was over.  If you want a tightly-knit, non-impressionistic film, this one isn't for you; otherwise, definitely take a look.",1346889600,,359,5.280701754385965
1639339,5,B00005O5JO,"It's just beautiful. Some parts, however, are extremely violent in a quiet kind of way and were hard to watch. Definitely worth watching, but I also had to take a little break from it at one point. Although not necessarily a ""tear jerker,"" I cried throughout the film. It's poignant, touching, and hopeful in a weird way.",1345766400,,321,4.649122807017544
1639340,4,B00005O5JO,"The concept and actual execution of David Gordon Green's debut film is actually close to perfection.  The deeply unsettled atmospheric transference of the film's core themes are seen in every sharply detailed frame.  The way the film is overlapped by intensified narration is also stellar (one of the few films that actually utilizes voice over narration properly).  The slow build of character; the way each presence in the film is unearthed with such restraint breathes such rawness into the film.  The actual `scene', that horrific tragedy and the way it sinks in your skin like a disease, brings a harsh reality to the film.  Some have knocked the film's dialog, but realism is mostly found in artistic expressions and so by taking a more stylistic approach to the scripting, Green actually gave the film more poignancy and delivered a more human and realistic story.  But, with all this praise one cannot ignore the elephant in the room; the acting.  I'm so tired of the trend some young filmmakers have of hiring `non-actors' to give their film's a more realistic tone.  It doesn't work that way.  Non-actors cannot act, so they don't know how to play natural.  They try too hard, and it shows.  It's awkward and takes you out of the film.  Not everyone in this film is terrible, but the acting does range from god-awful to promising.  Donald Holden has a lot of promise, and he layers George (the key player and most complex character) rather well.  Candace Evanofski is atrocious.  It was nice to see Paul Schneider in this film (I love him as an actor, especially recently) but he doesn't do much here, and Eddie Rouse is uneven at best.  Curtis Cotton III does well, and Damian Jewan Lee skates by with forgettable while Rachael Handy stumbles in her few scenes.  When I think of other films with young casts (`Mean Creek' comes instantly to mind) and the way they utilized true talents, I become irritated that Green didn't push for that.  A better cast would have made this film truly outstanding; one of the best of the 00's.  Alas, acting is a big element in a film; and this film lacks severely in that area.",1303862400,,2123,4.7046070460704605
1639341,5,B00005O5JO,"David Gordon Greer's feature debut is to be commended on many levels. A cast of young non-professionals presents a tale, not unlike others (like ""Mean Creek"") but without malice. Certainly, the visuals are inspired by ""Days of Heaven"", and Mr. Green has expanded on an earlier screenplay, but it is a complete narrative of a decaying society and the effect it has on the young people. Hope and despair abound, and the young cast should be applauded. The Criterion DVD has loads of extras, including the very disturbing ""A Day with the Boys"" by Clu Gulager, supposedly an influence for Mr. Green. Mr. Green's final film has to do with conscience and pride. That the cast is mostly Black is irrelevent. All kids could find themselves in this stupid quagmire... Let's hope it doesn't happen.",1260230400,,788,4.844444444444444
1639342,4,B00005O5JO,"George Washington was the first feature film ever made by indy wunderkind director David Gordon Green. It was released in 2000, to generally favorable reviews, and it truly deserved them. It has been recently released on an invaluable Criterion Collection DVD which I recently purchased. Most critics erred and went in for a facile comparison to filmmaker Terrence Malick, but this film has several things that Malick's films do not have. Yes, like Malick, Green is fond of lingering poetic shots of seemingly everyday things, but Green's film is far more concerned with individuals than any of Malick's four feature films are. Malick's 1978 Days Of Heaven does have its reach, though, as the black and white still photographs at the end of George Washington homage the black and white stills of that film, just as a young girl's narration echoes the young female character's in Days Of Heaven. But, the characters in George Washington are mostly poor North Carolina preteens of an eternal present, not historic artifacts, and they convey a sense of self that is absent in Malick's films, which mostly deal with issues, not people.
  That said, this film is not really a narrative, more of a simple series of linked vignettes that trace a several week period over a summer, which opens with a dreamy panoramic and poetic monologue spoken by a young girl named Nasia (Candace Evanofski), that weaves poetry out of the banal snippets that drift in and out of even the most prosaic minds, such as, `I like to go to beautiful places where there's waterfalls and empty fields.' This is not immanently poetic, but juxtaposed with the camera work it takes on a heightened, almost ecstatic, state. Some criticize the film by stating real children do not speak that way, but, a) I've known them, and a read of Anne Of Green Gables shows they've always been around, and b) the poesy is not of the character, but what the character says in relation to her station on life.... This film is not a great film, but it shows great potential, just as Malick's first film, Badlands, showed great potential, but not accomplishment. But it is a special film because it makes its specialness from what is remembered by all people, from their youth. As they go on with life, George and Nasia will likely drift apart, but both will have their own reasons for remembering that long ago summer the film charts, and we viewers will understand why.",1221091200,,2421,4.803357314148681
1639343,5,B00005O5JO,"firstly; this movie is unashamedly derivative of terrence malick.  structure-wise, down to the narrative techniques, it's a repositioning of 'badlands', but all i can say about that is, malick and green now work together.  if malick doesn't care, you probably shouldn't either.
to hold to the malick theme and 'badlands' and address people's issues with the dialogue, all i can say is 'i found a toaster' (just one of many laughable, stupid lines of dialogue from 'badlands').
it is also very similar to 'gummo', less sensational, but both movies are remarkably important it their visually poetic displays of how we are letting this country rot and how the rusted and wrecked places the out of control, locomotive progression of our country/culture (ie: capitalism) leaves behind are still teaming with life like a desert.  seemingly pointless and ugly life.  both films leave this image sitting there almost as a question, how will we rectify this complex and very real situation?  such things are so necessary that both films should be complimented and revered for putting them in our faces (see also: the entirity of 'the wire').
where the disconnect begins, i think, is in terms of the subject matter.  this movie is about expieriencing death in the developmental stages of childhood.  the pain, the guilt, the confusion, the struggle of little kids to say something or think something or do something that is as equally profound as death.  being forced to ponder what life is about at a young age, to make sense of it before you should every have to do such a thing.  being left behind to cope, create your own ritual, your own mythology, your own meaning, in a place that's been left behind and all set against a oh so meaningful festive backdrop with effectiveness unrivaled since shakespere.  astonishing, simply astonishing.
to be honest, i haven't cared so much for green's other movies but this, it is my favorite movie ever.
there are definate reasons this film is so highly regarded.",1205020800,,1996,4.949101796407185
1639344,5,B00005O5JO,"The children of this film speak of matters and in a manner that suggests a maturity beyond their years. They have to, since they have only peers to serve as moral guides. The adults in their life are preoccupied with other matters -- making a living by recycling the materials left behind from another age. While set in an unnamed small town in deep South, the film feels timeless -- the characters seem drawn from a Faulkner novel, the young woman who gives her voice to the film is not so much narrating as establishing a poetic space within which to assess the story, a story of innocence lost and of how to establish hope and meaning in a situation that appears to give so little opportunity for transcendence. It is in that context that a new George Washington, a young dreamer, with hopes for a brighter future appears -- the narrowness of the world experience available to these children is indicated by how they envision their potential: the narrator thinks that maybe George Washington, who she admires, could head up some kind of parade ... he decides to dress up as superman. There is something touching and profound and telling about the way that the children in the film respond to the tragedies both minor (jealousy, rivalry) and profound (accidental death, suicide) -- something about the fragility of the communities we build up, that suggests (without being bluntly allegorical) the difficulty of community in general and of American community in particular. How do we experience rebirth as a nation? Who can stand to unify us and give us hope? How do we hold out hope for the future as opportunities dwindle in our communities?

The film aims to explore a territory that adults know little about or choose to forget: that children (especially children who are left to themselves a good deal) don't think of themselves as innocent even in their play, and that they see themselves as making decisions fraught with moral consequences, that the questions who to be friends with, who to trust, who to love, and how to deal with hurt are every bit as profound for the child as the so-called ""deeper"" philosophical and political and moral questions that even adults tend to evade but discuss in situations of crisis. The film is slow -- it inhabits the same cinematic space as films by Terrence Malick, or some of the films by Gus Van Sant -- but it rewards patience (not in the sense of ""its hard to watch but it is culturally important so suffer through it"" but in the sense of the best films that, if you let them, and don't judge them by your own standards of entertainment, they can teach you something about what is possible in cinema). The opening sequence, in which two children break up, and we are introduced to the space of the story and to the voice of the ""narrator,"" is one of the most thrilling openings in any film I've seen -- all at once the very first time I saw this film (on a whim) I knew I was seeing something profound and original. I've enjoyed everything by David Gordon Green that I've seen since (Undertow and All the Real Girls) but nothing matches the fluent and meditative originality of this film that overwhelmed me on first viewing and that continues to move and astonish me even after several viewings. In my book this is one of the profound and enduring debut films of a filmmaker whose work places substance over style and yet manages to be unique and original in the telling, films like ""Badlands,"" ""Stranger than Paradise,"" ""Sex, Lies and Videotape,"" ""Shadows,"" and, more recently, ""Funny Ha Ha.""",1193616000,,3546,4.6736
1639391,3,B00005O5JO,"On paper, I should love this film.  It has many thing I admire in films.  It's beautifully shot in scope, it has a leisurely pace to it, and it's very understated at times.  But it's also muddled, sloppily edited, incoherent, and the dialogue leaves something to be desired.  The film has a real disjointed feel to it, and I don't think this is deliberate.  David Gordon Green's follow up to this, All the Real Girls, had the same sloppy craftmanship that this film does, except that film has better performances.  Some might say Green is attempting an expressionistic type of film, but he doesn't really pull it off.  Directors who do make expressionistic films like this one was trying to be (Tarkovsky, Tarr, Sokurov, Kieslowski) do pull it off, and their films feel remarkably coherent, despite the ambiguity that exists in them.  Here it doesn't work.  Green gets points for making an independent film that really isn't like Hollywood at all (many indie films have an eye towards the mainstream), but it doesn't fully work.",1174176000,7,1028,4.828571428571428
1639392,4,B00005O5JO,"I loved this film - I love the episodic story, which unfolds at a languid, lifelike pace - this subtlety captures the feel of life in a Southern city - GEORGE WASHINGTON was set in, and mostly filmed in Winston-Salem, NC (part of a metro area of over 1,000,000 people, though one wouldn't exactly see this in the film), one of the older and more industrial cities in the state, with a cast of locals.

You also don't see a trace of the mint julieps-and-kudzu (or hamfisted BLUE VELVET/DELIVERANCE freakfests) version of the South still favored by filmmakers who set stories in the region.  The sort of STEEL MAGNOLIA faux-drawwwwliness that has crept out of the quaintest and cutsiest Southern lit is completely banished from GEORGE WASHINGTON; a move I'd advise just about anyone wishing to set (or shoot) a film in this part of the country follow.  In another wise decision, Green sidesteps the reflexive quirk and posturing that infects too much American indie film.

I also love - finally - seeing a film with a fascinating story, enacted through a predominantly African-American cast that dodges the clichs and stereotypes seen in 'black film.'  A rather depressingly common filmmaker complaint is the utter impossibility in getting more literary or intellectually intricate African-American stories off the ground in Hollywood (witness the essential disappearance of Charles Burnett's KILLER OF SHEEP, a slice of DeSica-style African-American neo-realism unseen now for more than 30 years) - GEORGE WASHINGTON is an independent film, with a tiny theatrical release, and was made on a tiny budget, though Green makes extremely good use of the budget he had to work with.

Green's love for allowing his actors' personalities room to express themselves should also serve him well in the future. Characters here are allowed to dream and imagine, and there are moments when this film soars with a shimmering expressiveness - brought down to earth with a few well-placed dramatic turns, but still rather magical overall.

I would add a note concerning both the cinematography, and Green's use of dialogue here:  parts of my childhood were spent in neighborhoods in Charlotte (a city of 600,000+ people) that look VERY much like what I saw in GEORGE WASHINGTON, and recall occasions of running around some grimy neighborhoods with other friends engaging in plenty of the kinds of daydreaminess that occupies the characters here, even when those characters (and you: the viewer) must also deal with the intrusions of ugly or unpleasant realities.  Green nailed something here that almost no one else seems to get: even the grimiest places can occasionally startle with unexpected charm, and even the most impoverished people can occasionally remind one of just how vast and playful the human imagination can be.  Qualities in this film that first seem like impressionistic wooziness are in fact more real than many critics would seem to be able to fathom.

The similarities with Terrence Malick and Charles Burnett are obvious; but sparseness and the unobtrusive ability to see the complexity and dignity within characters also favorably recalls some Yasujiro Ozu, Eric Rohmer and Italian neo-realism, and if Green isn't yet their equal, he's still well ahead most of his indie film contemporaries.

1639393,5,B00005O5JO,"David Gordon Green is a master of his trade.  While some will argue that George Washington does not depict the best that Green has to offer, I believe that it is a great opening to a new chapter of modern filmmaking.  For George Washington, Green has borrowed techniques that have made such directors as Larry Clark, Harmony Korine, and Terrence Malick infamous in the film community, and transformed them into his very own.  George Washington is a perfect example of this.  With beautiful narration, exquisite background, and fresh faces that deliver dialogue worthy of both Oscar and recognition, Green gives us a chilling tale that is fraught with realism, desperation, and horror.  What immediately pulled me in to this film were the still-shots that defined the culture of the town.  These young children are experiencing everything that we have ever encountered in our lives up to that breaking moment of insanity.  We are pulled in to the story and direction because Green is able to bring truth to his ""fictional"" tale.  While we all know that this is just another ""story"", Green send goosebumps down our spine with his passion of realism.  For a majority of this film, I found myself questioning the ""fictionalization"" of this film.  What obviously were moments created by the imagination transformed into those that you could see on the streets of small town North Carolina.

An element that added to the realism of the background and story were the characters.  Green padded his directorial debut with unknowns and was able to command more emotion and dedication than you could see in anything ""big-budget"" Hollywood.  While it was obvious that he was working with child actors (i.e., some delivery was slow, some direction seemed choppy, and for one scene characterization seemed weak), he overcomes the typical stereotypes and brings the best of his imaginary world and that of the children into this film.  I loved that when Buddy went mission that Nasia thought that it was because he was still in love with her and could not cope with the emotion.  It seemed like a cheap moment of dialogue, but it made complete and utter sense in this film.  The actor that played George, Donald Holden, was phenomenal.  He brought that sad hero to the surface and we, as audience members, found ourselves rooting for him from the beginning.  He was simple, in fact, one could say that was a technique that Green employed to be successful with George Washington, he kept things simple.  What made George Washington different than Korine's Gummo is that Green doesn't emphasize the poverty level.  While he makes it clear with the surroundings and home-life of George, he doesn't throw it in our faces as a ""shock"" tactic like Korine does.  Not that there is anything wrong with Korine's tactics, I just thought that Green's approach was more subtle.  I also draw references to M. Night Shyamalan's vastly underrated Unbreakable due to the subject matter.  George Washington is the story about finding heroes in the most unlikely of places.  It is the story of how tragedy births the heroes of our lives, and while we should never disregard the tragedy, it does bring to light those that want to change.  Unbreakable, released the same year as George Washington, implies the same.  One could find a great research topic by comparing these two films side by side.

I think I may have zigzagged a bit in that last paragraph, but it just demonstrates my excitement for this film.  This is my second time watching George Washington and I think it gets better and better with each viewing.  Criterion was correct to add it to their collection of ever-growing films.  This is a film about childhood.  Rarely in film is it explored with such darkness and honesty.  Lately, there have been more films that surround itself around the topic (Chumbscubber, Mean Creek), but for 2000 this was a pivotal film.  I was engulfed by the reaction that Green pulled from the different characters.  Already I have spoken about George's transformation, but I also loved the insecurity that Vernon began feeling and the truth that Sonya finally saw about her future.  It is sad, but extremely real.  This film reminded me of a modern Stand By Me.

I must end with saying that this is not a film for everyone.  If you are not a fan of some of the directors that I have mentioned above, than you may not enjoy George Washington.  It is slow, simple, and developed.  Green takes images and makes the visuals actually work for him instead of fighting against it.  The narration could be annoying for some, but for me it completed this film.  I would have enjoyed more time spent with George's Aunt and Uncle due to so much is unknown about them, but that is what makes Green's work superb.  I liked this film.  For me, it is a prime example of true American filmmaking.  It takes us back to the roots of what cinema should be about.  George Washington takes us away from the explosions, the CGI, and the overpaid actors while delivering to us a story that should have shaken the Oscar tree.  Criterion was correct to release this film in their collection, and it is correct for you to add it to yours.  This is David Gordon Green at his finest!

1639394,4,B00005O5JO,"I'd imagine that if Mark Twain, Robert Frost, or Walt Whitman were still alive, they might appreciate George Washington as a film personified through a poem. Maybe not, but something tells me that David Gordon Greer, the director/writer of this film, comes from the same mold as the aforementioned individuals.

In it, we have five young friends - four black, one white - living among the ruins of an impoverished, yet somehow beautiful, ghetto landscape. When one of them meets accidental disaster, the others are left to struggle with guilt. One of the ways they do is through escapism. For one of them, he envisions himself as a superhero who can read God's mind, thus enabling him the power to predict who will die and who will live. Meanwhile, two of his friends take a path of self-destruction while the third watches the climatic events unfold with stoic restlessness.

I was amazed at how well this film was made. The characters, particularly ""George"", seem almost ethereal. When I saw the film, it didn't feel like a fictional movie. It felt like some otherwordly documentary focused on a place that most of us would otherwise ignore at all costs. Truly, David G. Greer has captured something splendid here, and has managed to turn the ""ghetto"" into a place of childhood dreams, both realized and dreamt. One of the top three films I've seen this year.

I'm giving this three stars because it's not really up to the level of many films that I gave four stars to. On the other hand, I'm not saying I didn't like it or that I don't think the director has potential for greatness. The down side for me is that I don't think story satisfies as a story. I don't, at the end of it, know what it was about in terms of narrative theme, etc. I wish I could make more sense of that side of things.

On the other hand, the filmaking is great. The mood, characters and dialogue, the cinematography, the originality. I love it that it's a truly southern film. And a film starring young black actors in something that's not about race, crime or drugs? That's also a wonderful aspect of this film. It's a true original. Flawed in ways that merit note, but it's also a lot more worthy of our attention than most Hollywood fare. So this is one three star movie that I actually recommend highly - if original, independent filmaking is of interest to you.",1135555200,4,1087,4.328431372549019
1639396,1,B00005O5JO,"I'd rented the movie UNDERTOW and it ""got me"" -- I've watched the first half of it more than just a couple of times.  A somewhat ""slow"" but utimately interesting movie.  I mean it really got me.  ""Masterpiece"" isn't a bad word for it.  Better than that :  there's SO MUCH ""undertow"" in every second, every moment of this wonderfully made film.

So, I had to try David Gordon Green's touted first ""film"" (it's ON film, but not really ""a film"", I wouldn't say) called ""George Washington"".  The DVD does have something most DVD's lack :  a little bit of writing in the form of a 3 page fold-out liner notes sheet.  However, the reviewer on the notes says (and this comment is paraphrased in the Amazon blurb, amazingly) : "" 'George Washington' is a work of humbling, breathtaking beauty' "".  Well !  While there may be plenty of generic beauty to be had in viewing most any living creature, really none of it is on display here, leave alone any ""beauty"" created by the filmmakers.  There's construction vehicles pushing around what looks like mountains of garbage bags and trash.  There's a kid who picks up a rotten mango or melon and throws it against a decrepit door.  There's a number of accidents dripping blood.  A drowning viticm whose resuscitation is retrenched, almost belittled.  Lots of time spent in a public bathroom.  There's death, mistreated animals.  A horribly injured snake rolling it eyes.  Dementia of all kinds.  The characters are having to constantly question one another "" Is something wrong wit choo ? "".  They also have to ask one another something like :  "" What the heck are you talking about ? "" a number of times.  The last thing you'd say about this film is that there's ""breathtaking beauty"" here !  lol

Still, overall, you sense there a singular genuis in gestation here.  It's a wondrously interesting concept for a film, even if there really isn't ""a film"" that resulted.  Too bad, but this came out to be a rotten egg (or worse), despite intentions and some amount of effort and work.

You CAN see, however, that David Gordon Green got a lot of ""research"" done (or ""experience"") that really was valuable in filming UNDERTOW.  Even as a first film, though, this is way knuckleheaded.

But if you've encountered ""George Washington"" -- don't miss a couple of viewings of the many layered, stunning UNDERTOW.

We're lucky there's a David Gordon Green, methinks.",1117756800,4,2393,4.707729468599034
1639397,1,B00005O5JO,"If I could give it ""0"" stars I would.
Had I seen this in the theatre I would have walked out. It was THAT BAD. The dialogue of the children is pompous, self-important, self-conscious and worst of all wanting us, the audience, to actually believe that the characters would be spouting this mess! The blond little girl was at least interesting until she opened her mouth and tried to wax philosophica. Pitiful and unbelievable!
Do not waste your money, time or energy on this movie. The writing, acting and directing were all horrible.",1066348800,3,533,4.741935483870968
1639398,1,B00005O5JO,"Dear David Gordon Green,
I know what you are doing. Its not working.
In ""George Washington,"" David Gordon Green tries to extract the natural beauty and poetic simplicity of Terrence Malick's films to the point of absurdity. The quick cuts to nature shots, the pseudo-casual speaking tone of children who stutter and say ""oh-so profound"" things...
This dvd contains his student films, which speak for themselves to show you what a talentless filmmaker this guy is. His Charlie Rose interview is nauseating. He lets Charlie stroke his ego about what an interesting new visionary he is....
Sickening and insulting.
Go buy Badlands and humble David Gordon Green before the master...TERRENCE MALICK",1048636800,8,693,5.252252252252252
1639399,5,B00005O5JO,"In one of the opening scenes of George Washington, a boy and a girl break up.  There is not much else to this scene, which makes it like most breaks ups.  It makes it like many of our experiences is childhood: they just happen.  The movie George Washington, however, mixes such everyday happenings in a poor, rural/industrial landscape with a level of complexity that is suprising and revealing.  The characters experience love, loss, friendship, joy, forgiveness, boredom, and a longing for something more.  The characters like each other.  Some are white, and most of them are black, but they are all friends.  Every summer, kids all over the country experience the kinds of events that many kids experience, yet there is a tragedy that occurs in this movie that renders this story unique.  Tragedy aside, George Washington is simply a beautiful and quiet film about one hot summer in the south and it's children.",1045267200,12,915,4.896103896103896

7948327,5,B00005O5JO,"My ""best of"" list changes often. Sometimes daily...not that I spend ALL my time organizing and reorganizing my favorite movie list...BUT, for the last ten years or so, I keep coming back to this film and cannot shake it. I first heard of it via a 4-star review from Roger Ebert and his trumpeting of new director (at the time) David Gordon Green. Regardless of Green's career arc (peaking out of the gate and going the wrong way since) and my feelings on his skills, George Washington will remain always his magnum opus. The indescribable beauty, simplicity, earnestness, thoughtfulness, truthfulness and delicateness here have to be seen to be believed. The film a young Malick might have made, a film an old Malick should want to have made. Art, poetry, soul-cleansing. The works.",1465171200,,782,4.887218045112782
7948328,4,B00005O5JO,"As a film, it is likely to divide viewers. It's interesting to see where Green's career has gone (Pineapple Express?!?! - Why??) coming from this. He was lucky to make it and he's definitely changed his ideals a bit since making this fresh out of film school debut. Its true, the film is shot in a Malick style and meanders plenty. Its also true that the acting is surprisingly fluid (especially from the kids) and the viewer is left to decide what to make of the film on their own. There is no tidy, neatly wrapped up plot, so audiences will no doubt struggle with this. The extras on the Criterion explain a lot of this, the Charlie Rose interview is enlightening and the Cast reunion, just one year later, is fun if not too indulgent. I can respect this film but its not likely to be one that sits with me over time (though admittedly since I finally got around to just seeing it, I have to give it more time). If you like Malick and or/Green, its a no brainer to at least watch though.",1449705600,4,989,4.294117647058823

7948333,3,B00005O5JO,"David Gordon Green (Eastbound and Down, Pineapple Express) made ""George Washington"" back in 2000, fresh out of film school and partially based on one of his own short student films.  It's an interesting story of childhood and adolescence, told mostly from the perspective of three young teenagers: George, Buddy and Nasia.  Without spoiling anything, a terrible tragedy happens and part of the film deals with how it affects the community as a whole.  But this isn't the driving plot behind the film; actually, there isn't that much of a plot at all.

The good: these kids turn in pretty impressive performances for first-time or relatively new actors.  Tim Orr's cinematography pretty much apes Terence Malick's style (which is actually good OR bad, depending how you look at it), and the film's ""rust belt"" backdrop is memorable.  Also, you get to see Paul Schneider (Parks and Recreation) in his acting debut.

The bad: Most of this film was improvised and it shows.  As mentioned before, there's barely a plot and the second half just kind of rambles on without much of a direction.  For a 90 minute film, this pretty much proves there wasn't enough material to begin with.  Maybe Green hoped he'd get lucky along the way---and there are some good moments, believe me---but as a whole the film just kind of falls flat.

Criterion's Blu-ray offers a modest improvement over their own 2002 DVD, from the 1080p transfer (presumably taken from the same master, but it still looks good) to the new DTS-HD 2.0 Surround track.  Extras are identical, including a solid audio commentary, a few short featurettes and two student films by Green; one provided the inspiration for ""George Washington"", mentioned earlier.

If you already own the DVD and consider yourself a huge fan of the film, you might get your money's worth.  But without a new master or new extras (how about another cast reunion?), casual fans and new viewers probably won't get as much out of this.  Definitely worth a rental, as Criterion's high price point makes this a pretty big gamble for those unfamiliar with the film.",1394582400,9,2089,4.894886363636363
