2412263,1,B000BBOU72,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I could only stand to sit through half.,1413849600,5,81,3.823529411764706
2412264,4,B000BBOU72,"The film opens up with a bunch of bad guys with KISS makeup driving a car with a pentagram painted on the hood. They go to rob a place and the next thing we know John Falcon (Nick Principe) is getting out of prison to enact revenge on the rest of his gang because....Well we don't know why, but we get bits and pieces in the flashbacks. John wants to kill his brother Sam (Todd Farmer) and get his Darling (Robin Sydney) wife/girlfriend back. Darling claims she likes to do drugs and have sex. Okay. Who doesn't.

That is pretty much it. The film is a grindhouse. Plenty of sex, nudity, and killing. Heads getting blown off with a shotgun, naked tattoo ladies, a strip joint, and drugs. Clearly not for everyone.

F-bomb, sex, and nudity (Robin Sydney, Kerry Krogstad, Carolyn Dorsey, Malice McMunn + strippers)",1410566400,,811,4.5479452054794525
2412265,5,B000BBOU72,"When you've been wrongly imprisoned, you come out MAD, is the moral of this story. This is your basic rough and tumble story of revenge of one tough bad guy, against the REAL bad guys, who generally deserve what they get. You really DON'T want to be on John Falcon's list of enemies! Lots of action and an ending you won't soon forget!",1410393600,7,335,4.333333333333333

2412297,5,B000BBOU72,"Wow this was a very good one. Tons of action and non-stop mayhem. Nick Principe's best performance I'd say. I don't get the negative reviews, this was a fun one!",1419811200,,161,4.4
2412298,3,B000BBOU72,"There really isn't much of a storyline with this one, basically a guy gets out of prison after ten years or so and reaps violent vengeance on the others in the Kiss makeup wearing gang he was formerly a part of.  Lots of blowing people away, stomping on their heads, and this sort of thing, oh and plenty of fk ing, I'd say sex scenes but that's a bit classy for what goes on here.  The guy gets picked up while hitchhiking when he gets out of prison by a woman in a convertible who after a bit of smalltalk asks him if he wants to f.  Next minute they are pulled over on the side of road, he's pounding into her from behind with the public passing by in the background. That's the sort of elaborate script and movie watching experience you're getting with American Muscle.",1418169600,3,773,4.244897959183674
2412299,2,B000BBOU72,"Bit of a comedy here. Actually, it's serious, but it's so bad that you will probably smirk just a little through most of it. Some nonsense revenge fantasy here in which a convict goes around exacting revenge on people for something done wrongly to him before his recently ended 10-year prison sentence. That's it. That's the whole movie. Lot's splatter and violence here, but it's nearly comedic. I have no idea who watches stuff like this, though I suppose that I did.",1418083200,4,469,4.7317073170731705
2412300,1,B000BBOU72,"Too too much violence and killing without any meaningful point.  Don't understand why it becomes a movie. It is even not a story - and if it is, it is a very negative one.",1417996800,,171,4.029411764705882
2412301,3,B000BBOU72,ok  this movie i a bad gride house of the movie faster with the rock  only differnce is this movie has boobs. other then that about the same not saying it is bad just reminds me of that movie.,1417478400,,192,3.8974358974358974

you might enjoy this film.
The lead is no (STONE COLD) but he does seem to be able to (KICK ASS) with some sort of white trash style.
while this aint no (PULP FICTION) but it does have some nice slutty gurls with a  (SPUN) type of  grit !

2412304,1,B000BBOU72,terrible movie which I purchased on the basis of a 5 star review at the time...after watching 10 minutes of movie...I went back to look and see that it only had 1 review of 5 star..so hopefully this review will contribute to average star rating ...I should be paid to watch this movie... a lesson learned on on purchasing movies.. before investigating how poorly made a film actually is ..,1417132800,2,389,4.571428571428571

8084907,1,B000BBOU72,"One star is too high a rating for this execrable film. Violence and crude language do no necessarily make a film a bad film if they are presented in a meaningful way which advances the story. Unfortunately, this movie's thin plot seems to have been designed only to connect the scenes of violence. Stir in crappy production, half hearted direction and ludicrously bad acting and you have a movie that stinks to high heaven. Save your money - stay away from this movie.",1498262400,,468,4.650602409638554

8084910,1,B000BBOU72,"After serving ten years in prison, John Falcon (Nick Principe) is released, and immediately sets out to get revenge on those who are responsible for his imprisonment. He also intends to go back to his wife Darling (Robin Sydney). The premise is simple, but good enough for making a reasonably entertaining exploitation film, which American Muscle is not.

Beautifully shot as it is, American Muscle has no style when it comes to action scenes. Despite the gores and violence, the films action scenes lack any sense of excitement or tension (or even unintended comedy). The action scenes starts abruptly, goes on and on without any visual rhythm or style, and then stops. In short, the film is just boring.

John Falcon is so sexy that some women want to sleep with him  and he does not let go of the opportunities, even when he should be looking for his wife. And our anti-hero kills a lot of henchmen, most of whom do not even know how to hold a gun, let alone use one. So what is the point of killing them?

Maybe the laconic anti-hero represents something, but I don't know what it is. Low-budget revenge movie American Muscle is clearly intended to be something more than just a low-budget revenge movie, but frankly I am not sure what it really wants to be. All I know is that the film runs only 78 minutes, and it still feels very long.",1433980800,,1342,4.533057851239669

8084914,3,B000BBOU72,"A real throwback to the 80's revenge flicks. If you miss those sort of exploitation flicks, this one is certainly worth a watch.",1425168000,,128,4.608695652173913
