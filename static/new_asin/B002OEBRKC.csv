8375994,5,B002OEBRKC,This movie showed me that not all of the African/Pan African leaders had a problematic misogynist streak/accepted financing from former colonizers. I could only say to myself why hasn't his name been brought up when people teach about Pan-Africanism in schools. Great documentary.,1422748800,,280,5.534883720930233
8375995,5,B002OEBRKC,"Thomas Sankara is one of my favorite men from Africa, his life and how he died I will never forgive those who took this man away from us. I have a different documentary about his life that shows a different view that I love very much, but this is a good add to the library.",1377388800,3,273,3.981818181818182
8375996,5,B002OEBRKC,"I recommend this book to the readers who are interested in learning why the empirical Western Countries have a constant interest in destabilizing third world countries, especially African countries. Thomas Sankara was a modern revolutionary (1983-1987) who sought to improve the conditions of his country though non-violent, democratic means.  This book shows you how the West uses proxy warriors to destroy true non-violent, democratic revolutionaries. It specifically, chronicles how the French and its proxies overthrew and assassinated Thomas Sankara because his revolution was making the country Burkina Faso truly independent. It also reveals his blueprint to insure equal rights for women, elimination of government corruption, and re-forestation.",1357603200,6,754,6.046728971962617
