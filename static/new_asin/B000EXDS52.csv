2544527,5,B000EXDS52,"Moving and beautifully made, we bought this film, and have since watched it over and over again.

It hosts a beautiful soundtrack and is filmed in such a way that it shows you the difficulties Mother Teresa faced while trying to support her one cause, to help the poorest of the poor.

An inspiration, with an outstanding cast. One of the best films I have ever seen. Highly recommended.",1156118400,5,387,4.594202898550725
2544528,5,B000EXDS52,Mother Teresa was the true woman of faith of our times. This movie will give you hope for your own life struggles and will teach you that there is a Way for those who look for righteousness and love.,1155945600,4,199,4.128205128205129
2544529,1,B000EXDS52,"To someone else, this might possibly fill their need.  Being an ordained deacon in the Catholic Church, I felt it was more Hollywood that actual events of Mother Teresa.  I felt also that the main actress selected to play this magnificent person did not do her justice, inasmuch as she (the actress) has apparently fallen away from her birth faith. I don't see how you could portray someone when you don't follow your own needs.",1154822400,16,428,4.693333333333333
2544530,5,B000EXDS52,Excellent video.  Good learning tool for anyone interested in true charity.,1154304000,3,75,5.818181818181818
2544531,5,B000EXDS52,"This awesome story of Mother Teresa who prayed to God by listening rather than only in words, gives scenes of Poverty, utter despair, gastly suffering, gradual Healing and Hope. As it flows along with pictures of Poverty, Suffering, Death & Dying I was reminded of 15 months of Clinical Pastoral Caring! At the Emory hospitals in the rooms of Billy Carter, Former GEORGIA Senators, Chap Douglas Turley and Joe Surber, I faced head-on Death and Dying nearly every day and many late night On-Call times.

Olivia Hussey surely  earnes an Oscar or Two!  Give it your best two day efforts by which to fathom its depth of Spiritual peace, Physical suffering, hopelessness, emptiness, loneliness, alongside impossible Problems of Mother Teresa's Committment and Ministering Love! Shalom, Sing-cerely, Retired Chaplain, Fred W Hood",1152144000,7,823,5.267175572519084
2544532,5,B000EXDS52,"Movies with spiritual themes often fall short, but this outstanding portrayal of Mother Teresa succeeds brilliantly in capturing the simplicity and unwavering faith of one of the most remarkable personages of the 20th century.  The cinematography and production values of this movie are excellent, but what really makes this a great viewing experience is Olivia Hussey's acting.  Her performance is deserving of high praise and recognition.  Just as Ben Kingsley succeeded in doing in the movie ""Gandhi,"" I always felt I was actually watching Mother Teresa.  Talk about a suspension of disbelief!  To watch such a convincing portrayal of such a pure and devoted soul is a very humbling experience.  It can make a person question the values they hold and whether what they are doing with their life is really all that worthwhile and important.  Mother Teresa was not about proselytizing or trying to convert anyone to Catholicism.  As the movie shows, she was simply moved to help the forgotten and the hopelessly infirmed of Calcutta. Her faith in God and her determination to really help those in need overcame many obstacles in her path. Also, the generosity of thousands of individuals who resonated with her ""cause"" helped enable Mother Teresa to accomplish all that she did.  A person like Mother Teresa can bring out the best and most noble instincts in others, even if sometimes begrudgingly. There are many poignant moments in this movie, and the movie as a whole is an important reminder that despite all the problems and misery in the world today, what is most pressing for each of us is to find our own way of serving the greater good. Mother Teresa's life was not an easy one, nor, I'm quite sure, was this an easy movie to make.  It cannot be easy to decide what to include and exclude in a movie about someone like Mother Teresa.  The bottom line for Mother Teresa was simple.  She saw Christ in the suffering and misery of the poor in Calcutta.  It would not have been possible for her to somehow turn away. Pay close attention, for example, to the opening scene where Mother Teresa happens upon an Indian woman and her child.  With the animals in the background, the scene is designed to be reminiscent of the familiar manger scene of baby Jesus.  This scene captures the essence of Mother Teresa's spirit.  She saw the Christ Child and the Holy Mother in the individual children and mothers she felt called upon to help. Above all else, Mother Teresa recognized that it was not enough to simply feed the hungry and tend to the sick.  There was another hunger, another need among people.  And that was the need for love. What a remarkable soul!  What a remarkable movie!",1152057600,66,2686,4.774891774891775
2544533,4,B000EXDS52,"More than twenty-five years before, Olivia Hussey was just as lovely when she played the Virgin Mary in Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazarus,"" and did so brilliantly.  She reprised the beauty of that performance in ""Mother Teresa,"" which is timeless too.  Serving the poor in Calcutta for most of her life, this Saint brought hope to those who had none and taught Jesus' Love to those who had seldom if ever experienced love before.

She received a Nobel Prize, but no earthy honor was her reward.  Her faith truly found a way when there appeared to be none at all.",1151625600,31,566,4.63

THE LETTERS movie to be released on DVD about the 28th of march is one i have on preorder that promises to bring mother teresa to life but i already know after seeeing this one, it will most likely pale in comparison, you just cant improve on perfect. and i did make the purchase here on amazon to buy this movie because i don't ever want to be without it. mary",1457308800,7,926,4.15

A widely revered champion of the forgotten and starving masses, Mother Teresa had a combination of shrewd diplomatic skills and unwavering devotion to the power of hope that earned her the love and respect of world and, eventually, the Nobel Peace Prize. This tale of a modern-day saint comes home to inspire viewers of all faiths and backgrounds to follow their dreams of making the world a better place.

2544713,4,B000EXDS52,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Thought I knew a lot about Mother Teresa and was ready to skip to next program when I heard ""The Voice"". Unchanged in over 45 years and unnerving: Lady Julietta by ear, but Mother Teresa by sight. Once again, she presents a near perfect rendition of a famous character with mannerisms and heartfelt simpatico within her sacred community.

I was unaware of the political infighting to promote her 'brand' with the Church and her adamant refusal to cooperate. The controversy over her policy of no condom use in HIV affected regions created serious concerns for supporting her canonization and saintly elevation. However, one is hard pressed to overlook her many passions to elevate the conditions of the impoverished, if only to remind them, they are not forgotten.

High recommend for Oliva fans, Christians and non-alike, Mother Teresa, her Sisters and bringing Hope alive!

EDIT: Having just reviewed related books, i.e. ""Mother Teresa The Final Verdict"" it is extremely difficult to support her efforts, albeit with warrants of further investigation. mega sighs....",1410652800,,1110,5.219101123595506

To anyone who objects to the actress because of Ms. Hussey's personal beliefs, I say, ""You're supposed to be concentrating on Mother Teresa and her message, not judging the actress.

After serving as a nun for 20 years, she felt God's call away from the convent and into the dangerous streets among the poor and destitute.  The Church said no.  ""Lord, what do you want from me?"" she said.  ""Why can't I be like other nuns?""  But obstacles were overcome.  Barrier after barrier throughout her life and ministry, doors were opened for her to serve as she sensed God calling her to serve.

Mother Teresa, as portrayed by Olivia Hussey, just leaves one speechless in the face of her love and faith in action.  I understand that the move has been praised by the Missionaries of Charity as an accurate, loving portrayal of their foundress. Certainly it does not try to hide or minimize her human frailty or the opposition that she had to overcome from governmental forces and even some within the Catholic Church.  Her words and her life are inspiring, no other word for it.  The only flaw in the movie, one easily overlooked, is the editing.  It can get a little jumpy moving through time periods in her life.

Few can criticize her until the they have lived as she lived, sacrificed as she sacrificed, and loved as she loved.  This film is well produced and well acted.  The actors all work to bring the love of Christ to life in the film.  The musical soundtrack is an additional actor that brings the story to life and the CD of the Soundtrack is worth buying!  Mother Teresa is one of the best known names of the 20th Century and yet the movie fills in the blanks, shows the heart of one who lived the incarnation of God's love, and who lived the Sermon on the Mount.  I may not agree with her biography, her views on other religions, but in the end...this film leaves every viewer inspired...and most of all, it leaves ever viewer with the hope that ""Hey, I think I can do that with the people I know who need love.""

I had heard of this homely little brown nun who did good things.  I had NO idea this movie would change my life. I cried during the entire movie thinking how little I have done to help the truly poor.  Not jist in the world but in my own city where there are shelters for the homeless and soup kitchens for the hungry. Watching this movie changed my life. I was always only ""into"" my Furs and Jewelry and living like Liberace. When this movie ended I went upstairs to my closet and pulled boxes of shoes, racks of shirts, and brought them to our local shelter.

She never forced her religion, only used it as an example of how Jesus loves us all, no matter what church or religion we belong too...  Everyone is a child of God....  Everyone deserves his mercy...

My husband, depending on his mood, may think it is slow and boring.  But I don't know a woman out there that won't love it.  It is moving and inpiring and just a terrific little movie to make you realize what a selfish person you are.  My gosh, Mother Theresa was a saint. The movie will inspire you to be less selfish and more giving to the needs of those around you.  And what a great film to show the kids.

I was afraid it might be in Italian with English subtitles, because I first found out about it surfing the web and stumbled upon a website of the Italian TV miniseries that was so popular and had become a movie on DVD.  I was pleased when I discovered all the actors speak in English.  This version is entirely English.  But you do have the option at the start of the movie to add either English or Spanish subtitles if you want... and because the actors have a sometimes heavy accent, the English subtitles might be nice to know exactly what they say sometimes.  The movie was around an hour and a half long.

I'm so glad I own it.  I can have a girlfriend's party and we can eat curry and watch it together.  I can share it with the ladies at church some evening.  And I can rewatch it when I am down and depressed about the stresses of life and it will add a juxtaposition to my perspective on things.

2544896,4,B000EXDS52,"Wow, what a nice movie! It exceeded my expectations. Most ""religious"" films don't have the funding for first-class production values, but this one must have because it looks great.

That beautiful photography throughout the 115 minutes was one of the two biggest reasons I enjoyed watching this. The other was the number of profound truths said by Mother Teresa (Olivia Hussey). This was an inspiring film with some great statements. By the way, those production values included decent acting, too, at least by all of the adults. Some of the kids were so-so, but they didn't have many lines anyway.

What I appreciated what that the filmmakers did not water down the Christian aspect of Mother Teresa's life. Everything she said and did was for God's glory, as she states several times, only trying to please Jesus. Obviously, she succeeded like few others have with an amazing compassion and selfless attitude. There is no ego here, no pride, only what she can do for the sick and poverty-stricken.

This movie can be enjoyed by all. You don't have be a Catholic. I'm not, and I have total respect for Mother Teresa and cannot find fault with anything she said or did. For Believers, this should inspire them to act a little more Christ-like. For non-believers, this story is a great example for anyone who simply needs a nudge to go help someone less fortunate. There is no heavy-handing ""preaching,"" either, for those concerned about that matter.

This is simply a quality film about an extremely quality person whose life should inspire all of us to become better people. This film did a great job in that respect.",1189987200,57,1618,4.830324909747293
2544897,5,B000EXDS52,"Being a Catholic homeschooling mother of young children who normally do not watch TV, I am pretty picky about the movies I let our family watch.  I would highly recommend ""Mother Teresa"" to any traditional Catholic, or anyone for that matter!  I know a little bit about Mother Teresa from reading a biography, and I saw no fatal flaws in the movie as far as from a biographical standpoint, but that is not critical to me. What is critical is that the movie is clean and shows the Church and Saint in a truly Catholic light, and is edifying all around. This film holds to all those standards. It is a wonderful film for a family of children of any age, and is well written and acted to par.  Olivia Hussey makes a perfect Mother Teresa, which I was a bit surprised to see since I have only seen her in Jesus of Nazareth and couldn't picture her as the Mother Teresa that I ""knew""!",1188172800,16,879,4.315151515151515
2544898,5,B000EXDS52,Mother Theresa truely has a heart like Christ. This movie is truely inspirational and is very well produced. I loved Oliva Hussey. Fantastic all the way around.,1185753600,2,160,4.962962962962963
2544899,5,B000EXDS52,"Although I am not a Catholic this DVD is wonderful!  You really see how Mother Teresa, through much toil and tears (and antagonism of India's officials) managed to show the love of God to so many of the world's poorest.  Olivia Hussey is remarkable as Mother Teresa--you forget that you are not actually seeing Mother herself!  It inspires one to see how this diminutive nun could influence the world while working with society's outcasts, demonstrating humility, compassion and of course, love--the love that would not allow her to ignore the great needs she witnessed all about her.  While other accounts of her life were important, in this one you see the reality of the person.  Wonderful!",1185494400,2,693,4.939655172413793
2544900,5,B000EXDS52,"Olivia Hussey could not have played a better part!!!!
She was so terrific in this movie!!
This is a movie to keep in your collection. A great one showing Mother Teresa's life. What an amazing woman!!!!

2544901,5,B000EXDS52,"This film is excellent!  I am skeptical that films can capture the lives of great saints in just 2 hours.  Of course you can't get everything, but they did a great job on this one.  I loved the fact that so many of Mother Teresa's quotes and sayings are distributed throughout the film.  Olivia Hussey does a great job portraying Mother Teresa.  It's definitely a can't miss!!!",1180483200,2,377,4.567164179104478
2544902,5,B000EXDS52,"After being disappointed more than once with Saints movies, my family and I sat down to watch Mother Theresa.  As far as we are concerned this is the greatest Saint's movie ever filmed.  I can not say enough about Olivia Hussey's performance.  She was Mother Theresa.

The writing and directing is faithful to this once living saint.  A must see for anyone who wants to see what true love is. Mother Theresa brought love to everyone she met because in everyone she met she saw Jesus.

Half way through the movie my 5 year old son proclaimed ""wow, she REALLY cares about everyone!""

This is a must have, and I am very happy to own it as we will watch this time and time again.",1176076800,7,675,4.352
2544903,5,B000EXDS52,"Fantastic movie, could be viewed with the whole family. My husband cried and it made us think about the real meaning of love. Mother Teresa is in our daily life now, as an example of giving and unconditional love.",1173312000,8,213,4.487179487179487
2544914,5,B000EXDS52,"Throughout time God has sent saintly people to live among us and show us the way  to live.  Mother Teresa was certainly one of the saints of our time.  This movie does a great job in telling her life story, and her openness to God's call to serve others.  The poverty and way of life for those who live in Calcutta is almost impossible for us in America to imagine, and this movie really showed what it is like.  I can't imagine seeing people lying in the street dying, and walking by and completely ignoring them. The holiness and humbleness of this great woman who served the poorest of the poor will never be forgotten.

If you want to learn more about Mother Teresa, I recommend you read ""Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light"" by Brian Kolodiejchuk.",1170720000,11,748,4.423357664233577
2544915,5,B000EXDS52,"It was amazing to watch such a compassionate, dedicated woman and how she gave her life to do the will of God in loving and helping all those people. Mother Teresa was and still is someone who displays the true meaning of being a child of God.",1170201600,7,243,4.191489361702128
2544916,5,B000EXDS52,Great movie.  Very inspiring.  Great movie for family.  We need more of Mother Theresa's work all over the world.,1168905600,8,113,4.842105263157895
2544917,5,B000EXDS52,"It is great to smell the fragrance of Christ in such contemporary persons, especially in a world full of other strange fragrances. The movie is really well-made, I enjoyed it several times.",1168387200,2,189,4.9375
2544918,5,B000EXDS52,"This film captures the essence of Mother Teresa rather than a linear biography of her, which I think she would prefer.  It is an inspirational portrait of a true follower of Christ's teachings.  She lived her life being true to her belief in him and his teachings and thats an inspiration to anyone no matter what your specific beliefs are.  Olivia Hussey is amazing and the film is well done.  A dvd worth buying because its something you can watch whenever you need perspective on your own life.",1167868800,4,497,4.613636363636363
2544919,5,B000EXDS52,"Olivia Hussey WAS Mother Teresa in this excellent film.  She walked like her and talked like her.  My only objection was with the writers, who referred to Mother Teresa as ""Mother"" too early in the film. She was Sister Teresa until she was given permission from the Vatican to start the order known as Missionaries of Charity. Only then was she known as Mother Teresa.",1167868800,6,368,4.6461538461538465
2544920,5,B000EXDS52,"This was a great movie.  Many moving moments as well as a careful illustration of how God

can work in mysterious ways.  I purchased this movie as a gift for my sister (a nun) and she

gain a lot from it.  It is a great inspirational movie.

I watched this movie as well as the A&E biography of Mother Theresa.

Buy it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that 'nothing is impossible with God.'

2544921,4,B000EXDS52,Olivia Hussey's performance gets better and better through out the film..but if you have no  understanding of the life of Mother Teresa you can get a bit lost...it doesn't do a good job of informing you of the sequence of events or give enough information to follow her life from a biographical point of view but if you want the spirit of MOther Teresa this film has it.,1163030400,4,370,4.4411764705882355
2544922,5,B000EXDS52,"Olivia Hussy delivers an outstanding portrait of Mother Teresa, mother of mercy and compassion to the poorest of the poor.  This film compels those who profess belief in Jesus Christ as savior to put their faith into action and to work for social justice, to show God's love to all human persons and to see Christ in those most marginalized.  Highly recommended for Church or parish discussion groups, teen youth ministries and for those who wish a closer look into the life and calling of a most remarkable but simple woman of great faith.  Caution, this powerful film and its message of the Good News of Jesus Christ can change your life!",1162944000,3,640,4.696428571428571
2544923,5,B000EXDS52,"I thought this story was a very fair portrait of Blessed Mother Teresa's life. It was true and accurate with drama and humor. Olivia Hussey was wonderul as Mother Teresa. It showed the human side of Mother Teresa and some of the problems she had to overcome in her quest to serve ""The poorest of the poor"" Definetely see it even if you are not Christian just to learn about some one who gave her whole life to help others!",1156636800,6,422,4.2875

I think I only watched about 15-20 minutes.  I'm now reading a really amazing book about how and why she started working in Calcutta (from her personal letters/correspondence). The Answer Is Very Surprising &  Extremely Interesting...I'm still reading it.  This movie was a disappointment.",1513382400,,500,4.975903614457831
