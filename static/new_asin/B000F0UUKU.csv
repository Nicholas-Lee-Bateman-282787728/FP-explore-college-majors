2547688,5,B000F0UUKU,"I remember watching this first on italian tv.  I was not impressed but when i saw it available on dvd i was tempted to see it again because some images from the movie tempted me to see it again  This time i really enjoyed (maybe it was in its origianl language).  I never knew linda purl before.  She makes her character real and sorrowful.  the story is not an original one but it kept me on edge to the end. One of he best b movies i have ever seen! Recommend to those who like watching ""evil"" trillers!!",1248134400,,506,4.122448979591836

2547690,1,B000F0UUKU,"Not even good enough for second billing. There's Widescreen,and Fullscreen versions. This should have been Noscreen. It's just not right to charge people money to watch this.",1162684800,,174,5.481481481481482
2547691,3,B000F0UUKU,"This made for TV movie doesn't leave any cliche unturned, but it does give Linda Purl the role of her career.  Purl plays Lacey, a psychotic obsessive sister in law to recently widowed Linden Ashby.  She's taken care of Ashby and his two children ever since her sister was killed in an auto crash two years earlier.  Things go awry however when Ashby decides to remarry, and lovely Shannon Sturges becomes the target of Purl's possessiveness.

Purl, a veteran TV performer, imbues Lacey with a dazzling and complex personality, shifting between the supposedly sweet and loving aunt to the vicious and vindictive harpy.  Purl is quite good in the role and elevates this movie to a higher status.",1151280000,16,694,4.8474576271186445

2547694,5,B000F0UUKU,"I think Linda Purl is a great actress and I enjoyed her bad girl performance in this movie.  Clearly an LMN type of movie where she thinks she has the guy in the bag.

2547699,5,B000F0UUKU,"I have watched this movie over 200 times, and I cannot stop.

It has the perfect amount of suspense and mental illness to keep you going!

Aunt Laci will kill you if you get in her way, or try to kill you with a peanut allergy so WATCH OUT...

THE BEST EVER, every one I have introduced this movie to, LOVED It ---afterwards feeling pretty stupid that they though LMN was

just sissy soap stuff...

BUY THIS MOVIE!! NOW!",1348963200,,420,4.265822784810126
2547700,5,B000F0UUKU,I don't understand all the negative reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed this little known gem as it had good dialogue/solid characters/plenty of suspense. The DVD cover makes it look like a grisly horror movie though. This is a well-directed movie that will keep you entertained,1333324800,,272,5.204545454545454
2547701,5,B000F0UUKU,"Are you searching for an entertaining movie to escape from a hard day's work? Well, ""Maid of Honor"" might be just the flick for you.  Surprisingly poignant and filled with superior character development, ""Maid of Honor"" is an above-average psychological thriller.

Unloved and plain, Lacey is an ""old maid"" who lives with her brother-in-law, Richard, and his two children after the death of her sister.  Aunt Lacey is a superb cook and a wonderful caregiver.  However, lurking underneath the kind veneer is an obsessed and manipulative individual.  Smoldering with hidden passion for Richard, Lacey will stop at nothing to get what she desires.

""Maid of Honor"" is presented in an engaging and suspenseful way, and the actors/actresses are excellent in their roles.  Linda Pearl, who portrays Lacey, brings poignancy and depth to a role that could have been two-dimensional, and the viewer feels a small degree of sympathy toward her.  The scenes with Richard's little boy, Danny, are chilling as Pearl's character sews seeds of doubt into the youngster's heart.  Linden Ashby is excellent in his portrayal of Richard.

If you're searching for a sutle thriller that probs the psychological depths of its characters, then please give this movie a chance.  God bless.",1269907200,3,1265,5.182266009852217

8116206,4,B000F0UUKU,"A couple of years ago, a father of twos wife was killed in a car crash, he has been raising his kids with her sister as a live in substitute parent since then.  However one day he decides to announce that he is getting married again to a woman he's been dating for the last two years. He thinks his kids accepting this will be the biggest hurdle.  However the sister isn't impressed at all, she sees herself as the kids mother and his partner and will do whatever it takes to stop this other woman taking her place.

This 2006 made originally for TV movie is obviously low budget but you don't really need special effects or expensive sets to tell this pretty simple tale.  It really comes down to the acting.  I can't say I've seen any of the actors in anything I can remember from before with the exception of Linda Purl who I have recognised from a couple of other made for TV movies. As the mentally disturbed sister, she does a good job, as do the two actors playing the kids. The husband and his fiance weren't the best but the others carried the story anyway.  It's an interesting movie in that they didn't go with the Hollywood norm of having young women in their twenties for the two lead roles. (Although the DVD cover implies they have done so).  This means they backed the quality of their script.  You often hear the complaint that there are no good roles for mature women, yet this one went with two and the movie actually was a little more realistic due to that decision.",1447718400,2,1486,4.3393501805054155

8116209,4,B000F0UUKU,"Maid of Honor is a great, but not perfect, made-for-TV thriller. Linda Purl plays her role as the psychotic title character perfectly. She was also good in Stalked At 17. I wish she would star in more movies, as I've become a fan of hers after seeing her in this and Stalked At 17.",1420329600,,281,4.222222222222222
