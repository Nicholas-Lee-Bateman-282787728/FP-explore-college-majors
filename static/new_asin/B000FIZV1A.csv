8123515,4,B000FIZV1A,"You can tell they filmed this a LONG time ago, but the clothing on the children don't appear that dated.  It's a wholesome collection of classic children's songs and nursery rhymes.  The second DVD skews towards the more religious Christian side, but not overtly so.  The third DVD includes a ton of patriotic songs.  However, the first DVD is a classic and my kids must have watched it endlessly.  I would highly, highly recommend.",1517011200,,432,4.783783783783784
8123516,5,B000FIZV1A,"The 3 DVDs are wonderful.  Even as an adult I love to watch the children singing all the favorite childhood songs.  They are nicely protrayed and so much fun for the little ones.  My grandsons enjoy watching these often and never tire of them.  Our little 9 month old granddaughter will love them, too, I am sure.  You won't regret getting this for the children in your life.",1481068800,,375,4.455882352941177

8123518,5,B000FIZV1A,"My son is almost 2 and has absolutely loves Cedarmont kids dvds since he was 1. He sings and dances to them. He loves to see the kids singing the songs and mimics them dancing. They are old school but are clean, positive and fun. I'd highly recommend them dvd or cd.",1408838400,2,266,4.134615384615385
8123519,5,B000FIZV1A,"My grandson just loves this! I can't say enough good things about this item. It's well made, the kids featured in this are just fantastic. I never tire of watching it myself. At 73 years of age, I grew up with a lot of these songs and I think it is great that kids today can be exposed to them.",1405987200,2,294,3.9166666666666665
8123520,2,B000FIZV1A,"And that's fine, if that is what you are looking for.  Nicely performed and nice melodies, but know that many of these songs are Christian children's bible songs.",1391299200,,162,4.785714285714286
8123521,5,B000FIZV1A,"My grandkids love these- the four year old really identifies with the singing kids and the two year old already recognizes the songs before they start by doing the actions-they beg me to put this DVD in-I babysit a lot and this is a problem solver-if they get irritable or cranky or start not sharing I just stick this in and their mood instantly changes-I love that this is so simple and done by kids instead of being a cartoon or cutsey grownups downtalking to children-it is just children and my grandkids seem to like it that way-I can see over the last few months of them watching how the children on the DVD interact and sing that my older grandchild (4 1/2) has learned to be more confident and outgoing and that it is okay to sing or be silly in front of others-he just started preschool and I can see that he acts more like the kids on the DVDs when he has to sing or talk or be in front of the group than the other kids-I believe this DVD contributed a lot to his selfconfidence by the way it portrays ""silly"" especially in songs such as ""Michael Finnigan""-thank you Cedarmont Kids for contributing to this special learning experience for my grandchildren",1383782400,2,1165,4.423255813953489
8123522,4,B000FIZV1A,"This is a great disc and, in spite of our ""complaints"" we still like it.

Issue number 1 - Some of the videography / video effects on just a couple of the songs in downright annoying and literally strains your eyes while watching them.
Issue number 2 - What's with the title?  There are all of 33 songs on the disc... not 100

Overall a good product but I knock off a star for these two issues.",1376697600,,394,4.090909090909091

I remember a lot of these from growing up and I am delighted my grandchildren can have these to enjoy as well.  Thank you so much for make this CD and making it available.",1339286400,,330,4.344262295081967
