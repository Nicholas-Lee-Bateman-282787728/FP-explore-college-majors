wasteful production had to be mortified...in street clothes & sneakers - moving around in a banal parking lot - utterly useless appropriation of wonderful music. Junk in the name of daily modernity. Life is too short for ...this.",1006387200,11,294,5.145833333333333
847842,1,6304359861,"The great triumvirate of ballet composers, in chronological order are Delibes, Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky. Here we have a wonderful orchestral performance of a Delibes masterpiece conducted by Kent Nagano.
Beyond the opportunity to listen to Delibes'score, this production proves its indestructability. I don't necessarily believe that choreographers cannot choreograph known music to their whim........ provided it works. In this case very little does. There is hardly any dancing.... even of the modern variety.... The conceit of a dream sequence showing multiple Coppelias all in red with blonde wigs, some of them in travesti, could have been fun if they were given something interesting to do or to dance. There is neither wit nor arresting movement to this longish sequence. Amazingly, this production has toured all over the world. I don't see it, hence I do not recommend it. If you buy it close your eyes and listen to the music.",1004054400,12,938,5.26
847843,4,6304359861,"This innovative little jewel creates a mesmerizing glimpse of the potential for film and dance collaborations.  Yes, the story line of Coppelia takes a few bruises, and the dancing is not tutus and pointe shoes, but it is fantastically satisfying storytelling with wonderful dancing.  The concept is fresh and the execution is crisp, so what's not to like?  As in Zeffirelli's opera films, the use of film creates unique opportunities to stretch the story and to fill in details that are simply not possible during a live stage performance.  This film is definitely worth the price, if only to see the potential of dance performance stretched in a marvellously creative manner.  We need more dances like this to give new life to the great old warhorse ballets - Bravo!!",996278400,4,769,4.930232558139535
847844,3,6304359861,"This is a beautiful, well done film--but it's not the traditional  Copp?lia, so be warned! It is set in and around apartment buildings in  modern-day France, and the wonderfully innovative choreography reflects the  fact that most of the dancing is done, not on a sprung, wood floor, but on  pavement! Beautiful and witty...but I was actually looking for the  traditional Copp?lia to show my piano students, and this one veers wildly  off the story, especially at the end, where a Dali-esque film-within-a-film  version of Copp?lia swallows up the voyeuristic Dr. Copp?lius as the  multi-gendered Copp?lias (note the plural!) multiply and wreak havoc on the  poor Franz and the misguided doctor. A very interesting Freudian ending,  but kids (and many adults) won't understand it.
I subsequently purchased the video of Coppelia with the Australian Ballet issued by Kultur Video and was delighted. The Australian Ballet version is warm, witty, and set in the traditional generic Central European village. For the purposes of introducing students to the story of this ballet, the Australian Ballet's version is preferable to the Lyon Ballet's. But I have had a lot of fun showing people the Australian Ballet version and then the Lyon Ballet version, as an example of how classics are adapted.",968284800,16,1291,5.193236714975845
847845,4,6304359861,"The Lyon Opera Ballet has to the best contemporary dance company in France and is known to one of the best in the world. This version of the Ballet classic Coppelia was staged by french choreographer Maguy Marin. Her  version is indeed ... very modern ! It uses a combination of live dance and  film + Delibes original score performed by the Lyon Opera Orchestra  conducted by Kent Nagano. Coppelia is an unreachable magazine icon, a  glamorous cover girl who looks a Pedro Almodovar  travestite. The show is  brilliant, very very very funny.

848171,4,6304359861,"If any work can cause one to fall in love with a ballet, Coppelia is a front-runner.  Kirov's rendition here has the mix of talent, set design, lighting, and music to make it all fly happily.  The only thing that's puzzling here is why this production chose to re-order the numbers as given in the original scoring.  For the uninitiated this new interpretation may make the story line a little easier to tap into, but the more traditional offerings are not that difficult to absorb.  So I ask, why the change?  Nothing is really new---just a bit differently ordered.  However presented, this is a hard ballet not to like.",1372896000,,621,4.651376146788991

848176,1,6304359861,"I share the views of my fellow balletomane and reviewer, Jack Wilensky, but will be less generous than he in my rating (1 vs 2 stars).  There is absolutely nothing in this production of merit.  I can only hope that Patrice Bart's equally deplorable re-staging of Coppelia (for the POB) never makes it to DVD, as it was torture to sit through it (at 80 Euros per ticket, no less).  Although I would never say ""no to innovation,"" there are some ballets where too radical a departure from the original choreography / libretto (Bejart's Nutcracker and Bourne's Swan Lake come to mind) simply destroys the beauty of the work.  And I regret that's just what the Mariinsky succeeded in doing here.  Stick to the definitive (though hardly flawless) Australian Ballet version.",1246147200,7,767,4.824427480916031
848177,5,6304359861,I love this version. The Kirov knows how to make this ballet exciting. Very colorful. Especially the four young men in the photo on the cover. They gave this opera a gusto by their dancing. I recommend this to other ballet lovers.,1237161600,3,230,4.5

848378,2,6304359861,"This is not a classical ballet version of Coppelia by any stretch of the imagination.  There are no bravura variations at all!  There are none of the traditional solo variations in act one, such as the great solo waltz variation of Swanilda, in fact, during the music where this variation is normally danced, she is just climbing up a ladder!.  There is no opening mazurka that usually occurs at the beginning of act one.  The very important and beautiful shaking of the wheat variation is done away with here.  Most of the dancing sequences are merely pantomime routines(dancing in which all the body movements have a meaning, such as kicking Franz in the head!).  Perhaps this type of Coppelia has a place somewhere in the theater, but it is not what we normally think of as ballet, especially classical ballet.  It resembles a ballet, since the costumes and sets are magnificent, but Vinogradov forgot to include any kind of dazzling choreography, the kind that this classical ballet is noted for.  If you read my other reviews, you can see that I have great respect for artistic freedom and leeway, but it misses the mark here completely.  The dancers themselves are excellent, the fault lies with the choreographer, Vinogradov.  He has a totally different conception here.  At first, there is the promise of something that might be new and fresh.  The opening sequences include the Coppelia doll herself dancing at the start of act one, and we see that Dr. Coppelius has been given some dance steps, but the innovation ends there!  In act two, much of the choreography is quite grotesque, as if the dancers were drunk, or instructed by the village idiot.

Do not think that anything from the Kirov must be fantastic.  Buy this version if you hate ballet, but it kind of looks like ballet, so why bother?  If you want a fine, classical version of Coppelia, try the Australian Ballet version--you won't be disappointed.",1153353600,29,1922,4.814024390243903
848379,5,6304359861,"This is an outstanding production of one of the most beloved ballets in the classic repertory. Fortunately, there are several very rewarding DVDs of Coppelia, including the 1993 version by the Australian Ballet, but the 1993 Kirov rendition does an exceptional job of capturing the spirit of the story and portraying the characters.  It is beautifully choreographed, staged, and photographed, including some charming close-ups and overhead views from the vantage point of the mechanical doll, Coppelia. The famous Russian choreographer and set designer, Oleg Vinogradov, never wanders far from the story and charms the viewer with some clever surprises. He carefully integrates the corps de ballet by having it reflect, at times, the movements of the principal dancers.

Unlike other versions of this ballet, the Kirov production includes an extensive and humorous dance scene, in Act I, with the mechanical doll in the town square. Franz and his friends are attracted but bewildered by its mechanical responses as they try to help it unwind.  The character of Swanilda is charmingly portrayed by Irina Shapchits in both her expressive dancing and facial expressions. She shows remarkable balance and flexibility in her solo routines and duets with Franz. Act II provides a lively and inventive display of Dr. Coppelius' mechanical toys, including the amazing gymnastics of the Nutcracker. On a humorous note, Swanilda, posing as the doll, kicks and slaps Franz for being unfaithful to her. The town square scene demonstrates why the Kirov is probably the world's premiere corps de ballet. Its stunning and versatile performance reminds one of a corps of gold medalists. While Vinogradov has choreographed many of its movements to support the lead dancers, he also allows it to be inventive with a lively Mazurka, and a wooden hammer and legwork routine that would impress any gymnast. This is followed by golden spinning wheels accompanied by expressive armwork. This provides a lovely transition for the principal dancers as they try to reconcile their differences with the active engagement of the entire ensemble. Yes, Vindogradov introduces some innovative and new choreography to a classic ballet, but so did George Balanchine.

Ballet lovers should probably purchase copies of both the Australian and Kirov versions. Each one takes great liberties, as does Offenbach's popular opera, with E.T.A. Hoffmann's Medieval tale of an eccentric inventor.  Hoffmann would have been pleased with Coppelius' Gothic workshop in the Australian version. I suspect that he would have been charmed by each of these interpretations. The Australian production provides some outstanding dancing, especially by Lisa Pavane, as Swanilda. She displays a remarkable range of technical skills and talent for mimicing several mechanical toys. The Australian version is performed before a live audience. While we never see the audience, it makes itself known by frequent outbursts of applause that, at times, tends to distract from the flow of the story and dancing. (Now I can understand why Russian audiences tend to be rather reserved until the curtain calls.) The final scene tends to become a showcase for displaying the formidable skills of the lead dancers, including a series of spins, turns, leaps, and lifts. They are rewarded with generous applause. In direct contrast, the Kirov version is performed without an audience, and this provides a continual flow of action and a character intimacy that is very satisfying. However, you may be disappointed if you consider the audience's reaction to be a necessary part of the experience. Watch for the clever method that Vinogradov employs to allow the corps and lead dancers to take their bows before an empty house. He makes certain that Coppelia is not forgotten. What a treasure!

848381,2,6304359861,"I was really disappointed with this production.  Bujones was quite good, but I felt that the rest of the cast were second rate.  However, my biggest irritation was the audience. They were intrusive and very loud, wild applause as soon as one of the principals appeared which continued during the dancing, usually culminating in whistles and much stomping of feet completely drowning out the music.  Why couldn't the DVD production people at least reduce the noise, or wait until the dancing had finished?  I doubt that I will watch this DVD again. The two stars are only for Bujones' dancing.",1149292800,6,592,4.89
848382,5,6304359861,"Tchaikovsky is said to have much admired the ballet scores of Delibes.  Of the ballet scores composed by the latter it is his ""Coppelia"" that ranks in excellence with those of Tchaikovsky.  It is still staged everywhere and DVD productions of it appear every few years.

This one derives from the Marinsky Theatre, St Petersburg, 1993 and features the Kirov Ballet.  You'll see the exterior and the interior of the theatre but never the orchestra nor the conductor.  The dancing on stage is filmed in close up and from all angles (including from above in one memorable sequence).  An audience is not present.

Exuberance typifies the dancing.  The dancers are uniformly lithe and lean, athletic and agile.  He who dances the Nutcracker in the third scene is capable of amazing contortions.  The costumes and their color contrasts are especially gorgeous.  As for the music, it is perhaps the Theme slave varie in the first scene that is the highlight.

I am beginning to think that in this medium (DVD), ballet recreates better than opera in the home.  Does anyone agree?",1149120000,29,1071,4.883333333333334
848383,5,6304359861,"Fernando Bujones was one of the finest dancers of the late 20th century and to see him perform in this Coppelia is truly breathtaking!  Swanilda is played by Ana Maria Castanon and she also dances fantastically.  Her pirouettes and balances are awesome!  Both dancers are given many solos and PDD's.  The entire cast is fantastic.  The group dances are danced with great spirit on a somewhat cramped stage.  The camera work, unlike many recorded performances, is perfect.  At times the viewer gets the feeling of standing right next to the dancer.  There are some drawbacks to this dvd. It was recorded in 1980, so there is some tape hiss and the image quality is not perfect, but acceptable.  This video has been around for quite a while on vhs but this transfer to dvd is most welcome and coincides with Bujones's untimely, recent death.  The ballet communinty, as well as his friends and family miss him dearly.  What a great remembrance this dvd is!",1144886400,10,953,4.75

This is one of the most brilliant ballets that I have ever witnessed.  Everything about it is magical and stunning -- the urban set, the choreography, the vision.  Ballet on asphalt and in sneakers?  It totally works, and it's pure pleasure watching it develop.  Don't miss a heart beat buying this film, and then prepare yourself for something entirely different from everything you previously imagined dance to be.

848385,1,6304359861,"Want to have nightmares? Well, then get this DVD.

What was the Lyon Ballet thinking of?????

Copellia is a very gentle, charming wisp of a ballet. A light touch is essential. Delibes score is light and delicious.

All of that goes into the trash can. Much of the music is cut,

this version of the ""ballet"" is set in a seedy urban setting.

There is almost no dancing. Swanhilda hardly exists except to

do some quasi-ballet moves in combat boots while munching an apple.

The horror really begins in act 2. Dr Copellius is able to produce a never ending series of Coppelias, they emerge from

a movie projector. All have red dresses, spike heels, and blond

wigs. They seem to be both male and female underneath the oppressive costuming. And that's pretty much where the ""concept runs out of steam. There is a little more perfunctory action,

instead of Swanhilda doing some of the doll specialty dances,

Dr Coppelius and Franz do them instead. Why?

What did this gentle ballet do to deserve this?",1096156800,5,1001,4.6571428571428575
848386,2,6304359861,"First, I bought this DVD.  Then, I read the other (1-star) reviews of the performance.  Now, I just watched it.  Perhaps I should be concerned about my timing.  All that aside, this is a very weak rendition of a classic ballet story.  I doubt if many people will enjoy this performance.
Even though I consider myself an open-minded fan of modern dance, I'd say this version of Coppelia (by Opera National de Lyon) is a major disappointment for one BIG reason:  very little dancing.  I wasn't bothered by the run-down, urban setting, nor did I find the dancers in street clothes to be revolting.  Rather interesting, actually.  Also, the fact that Leo Delibes' score was cut down drastically was only mildly upsetting.  It's just that, with a run time of about an hour, I'd be shocked if there were more than twenty minutes of dance choreography on this disc.  Too bad.
I'll give credit where I believe it is due.  The music is sensational:  clear and moving.  Also, the camera work and editing, while not A+ quality, are worthy of honorable mention (check out the activity in Coppelius' room while the projector is running).  The lighting for the nighttime outdoor scenes is first-rate.
As for the dancers ... I can't say.  They were more actors than anything else, and not so believable at that.  The story is purported to have an ""edgy new twist,"" but it was only the cinematography aspect that kept my attention.  As a ballet troupe, the artists are rendered virtually inert.
If it's theater you're after, you'll probably stay interested all the way through.  From a dance standpoint, I doubt you'll want to watch this more than once.",1029715200,6,1637,4.74113475177305

7868468,5,6304359861,"This is a review of the Kirov version of Coppelia.  I have five different versions of this ballet, and the Kirov version is my favorite one.  Oleg Vinogradov streamlines this popular ballet, while emphasizing the strengths of the company.  The ballet starts by introducing the four main characters in the first 40 seconds and then immediately proceeds to establish their relationships.  No time wasted there.  Some characters function differently in this version.  The character of Dr. Coppelius has a different personality here than he has in other versions.  I for one approve of this change.  I like this Coppelius.  Vinogradov also makes Coppelia a real dancer instead of a simple catalyst for the plot.  Another change of which I heartily approve.

While some parts of the story are minimized or eliminated, others are expanded.  Most especially appreciated are the elaborate dances of the mechanical dolls in act 1 scene 2.  This scene alone is a good enough reason to buy this DVD.  The principals dance well, act well and have a good stage presence.  The corps is lively in the village dances of acts 1 and 2.  The dancers playing Franz' and Swanilda's friends are also quite good.  Last but not least, the delightful Delibes score is beautifully rendered by the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra.

Irena Shapchits captures the essence of Swanilda.  She is at one time or another angry or loving, resentful or forgiving, mischievous or just plain felonious.  But she is never dull.  And speaking of angry, she dances angry in act 1 scene 2 as angrily as I have ever seen.  Mikhail Zavialov does a very good Franz, and he and Shapchits have a real on-stage chemistry.  Petr Rusanov makes the new Dr. Coppelius his own.  Elvira Tarasova shines as the dancing doll Coppelia.

One last note: there seems to be a lack of synchronization among some of the dancers at times.  This is especially apparent in act 1 scene 2.  For me this added to the rustic ambiance of the production, and may have been purposeful.  However, it does have the feel of a dress rehearsal rather than a performance.  I don't care.  It works for me and I still like it.",1407974400,2,2140,4.7835616438356166
