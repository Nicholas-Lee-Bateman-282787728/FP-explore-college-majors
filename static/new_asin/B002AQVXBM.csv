8360059,5,B002AQVXBM,"I got this movie because I felt like I wanted to see ""Pirru's mom"".
""Division narcoticos"" -1963- is great because besides Ms Michel, I got to see Margo Su and Fanny Cano.
The plot has government agents (Olivia Michel and Julio Aldama) after the drug dealers. They have to pretend they use it and sell it in order to infiltrate the mafia's headquarters, which is located under a Bar. The cigar girl there is Margo Su and her uniform is great! She is petite, and to make matters worse, has a huge (and I mean huge) teased hairdo. Remember those little dolls with a big head? Exactly. She wears a mini skirt and black stockings complement her look.
Fanny Cano is the ''best friend'' of the ring leader, so she is using her ''feminine charm'' to get ahead in life.

For Ms Michel fans out there, there is another movie you don't wanna miss where she plays a nurse. She is rich though, but works in the Hospital to be close to the doctor she loves. One day, while performing surgery, the camera makes an extreme close up to her eyes (with a filter that resembles stars or glitter in her iris) while the doctor's eyes are flat, no special effects, nothing. Back to her eyes with the glitter, then back to his eyes with a cheap lens. And they had to do this during the whole ''surgical intervention'', since nobody was doing nothing down there and the camera couldn't get down to film it!!
Nothing like a 60s movie to spend a funny hour or so!",1316736000,,1436,4.378277153558052
