8582460,4,B001ARYK44,"Paul Ridker, Antonio Gotto, Lori Mosca three senior heart disease researchers come to Charlie Rose to report on a study supervised by Ridker. It showed that the cholestorol - lowering Statins have great benefit in reducing heart- disease, and stroke risk even among those who do not have elevated cholestorol levels. Ridker says that Statins have proven to be a remarkable medication both in the great benefits they bring, and their relative freedom from causing side- effects. He also suggests that it would be worthwhile to invest in a much wider distribution of Statins as a way of severely reducing heart - related disease. Mosca while not contending with the findings say that they should not be used to neglect the emphasis which needs to be placed on proper diet, exercise, healthy living. She says that there is a danger in encouraging people to believe that if they take medication the other elements are not necessary.  I believe it is Gotto however who points out that studies of diet and behavior have shown us that people have great difficulty changing eating and exercise habits, and that most do not succeed. He too thinks the wider use of Statins will be of great benefit to public health.",1227139200,2,1205,4.849514563106796
