8277144,5,B001ADXX5A,"Great movie! But to be honest then best part about this was the behind the scenes special features! They ran longer than the movie itself, and as an aspiring filmmaker it was immensely fascinating and helpful!",1498435200,,209,4.833333333333333
8277145,3,B001ADXX5A,"I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would, it was just a little too out there and quirky for me. It got a little weird and kinda boring at times. It left me feeling kinda sad and empty.",1335052800,,197,3.7142857142857144
8277146,5,B001ADXX5A,Really great indie film. The artists made and released this movie on their own credit cards. So support the artists,1297036800,,115,4.8
8277147,3,B001ADXX5A,"It is funny to watch in Brooklyn this story of young Brooklynites divided with modern telecommunication and computing technologies even more than their forebears in their times were, as newly just made public  study  shown a rise in bisexual contacts between sexually-active teens locally.

A sort of STD awareness and quest for teaming prevails anyway.
Rather boring romantic story of liberated young main-stream Jews and their various pals and gals living alongside.",1288137600,3,468,5.472222222222222

8277149,3,B001ADXX5A,"Four Eyed Monsters (2005) is a truly original and artistic narrative film; part drama, part documentary. As part of the project there are also thirteen webisodes that make this experience more than a movie. It is a story of a relationship at its core but turned into so much more. The title refers to a couple, the oneness of two people, and how that oneness can often turn into a monster.

Arin Crumley and Susan Buice have created an emotionally powerful film about their relationship and sexuality. The collection of music is intoxicating when mixed with the unique, often abstract, videography. In the beginning of the film we are introduced to Arin and Susan's past; they are both introverted struggling artists. After meeting online they start a very eccentric relationship in which they do not talk. They decided talking is usually the most uncomfortable part of a relationship and that they would only ""speak"" through writing, video, and artistic means. During this time they also decide to make the film that you are watching. Regret, love, empathy, jealousy, and all the emotions that come with a relationship are touched on.

7 out of 10 (webisodes 9 out of 10) - It takes us deep into the mind and feelings of today's relationships, albeit from two very artistic and erratic people. I recommend watching the movie first then all the webisodes (all are on the DVD). I found the webisodes to be more interesting than the film and they give important insight about Arin and Susan and the film. They are also very powerful from a filmmaking stance about the ups and downs of creating an independent film. The movie did run a bit slow and lost its direction a few times and although beautiful and compelling, some of the imagery didn't add value to the film. Once I saw the webisodes I felt they could have done better with the feature film. Overall the project (film and episodes) was interesting and entertaining; I found myself wanting more.

8277151,3,B001ADXX5A,"Four-Eyed Monsters (Susan Buice and Arin Crumley, 2005)

Four-Eyed Monsters is occasionally uncomfortable, occasionally boring, and occasionally brilliant. It never manages to sustain any emotional reaction, which is its biggest flaw; it does make the viewer question constantly what's autobiographical and what isn't, which is its greatest strength. Which one is more noticeable to you is likely to be the difference in whether you love it (as most critics seem to) or hate it (if IMDB is anything to go by...).

Arin (Crumley) is a painfully shy video editor who both reviles and envies the couples he sees on the streets of New York. He decides to turn to Internet dating, and meets Susan (Buice). Their first meeting is short, nasty, and brutish, but Arin finds himself rethinking that decision, and embarks on a really creepy campaign to get a second date. This is where things really get interesting (and it's the brilliance of this conceit that always seems to get mentioned); once they start getting back together again, Arin is so shy that rather than talking, he wants the two to communicate solely by writing when face to face. Honestly, I wish I'd thought of it when I was in high school. This leads to nastiness when a sensitive topic is covered, and well, things just keep gettin' on gettin' on from there.

While the concept is fantastic, the execution is everything that annoys me about low-budget filmmaking with none of the high points-- there's the jerky handheld camerawork, the teen (well, twenties) angst, the overall bristliness, but without any of the edginess, the danger, the willingness to tread ground that no one else will. It's a movie about a relationship-- a very odd relationship, but nothing one wouldn't necessarily see from Hollywood. And, honestly, for slice-of-life cinema to work, I need compelling, interesting characters. Just being quirky isn't enough, and it's not close enough to a documentary for me to really be fascinated simply by the fact that these characters exist (a la Sherman's March). You may love it, you may hate it; I'm split right down the middle. ** ",1223596800,3,2110,4.985795454545454
