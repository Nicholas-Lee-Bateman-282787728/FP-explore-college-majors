7863920,5,6304123809,"Slayers has got to be one of my favorite Animes. I absolutely love them. Its full of laughs, action, and ""gimme the next volume!!!"" excitement. I say let the more mature ages watch it to really soak in the purpose. It's a wonderful one to watch!",960681600,,245,4.3478260869565215
7863921,4,6304123809,"Wow!  Surely after seeing the first Slayers tape you wouldn't stop there!  In the second volume, the plot gets so much more intense, keeping the humor and surprising the viewer whenever possible!  Slayers is a great anime,  especially for fans of whacky-ness and spunky action.  The music is GREAT  in the show as well!  More than that, it's AMAZING!  It was actually the  reason I started watching.  Check this one out, you'll like it.",952905600,,436,4.77027027027027
