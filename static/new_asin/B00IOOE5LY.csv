8644197,5,B00IOOE5LY,"Before The Exorcist, and before The French Connection, there was The People vs. Paul Crumpand before that, in 1953, there was the historical Paul Crump, a robbed food plant in Chicago, a murdered security guard, and several beaten employees.  William Friedkins first film is a documentary noir that explores the case of Paul Crump, one of the five men arrested for the aforementioned crimes.  But Paul Crump is not only a film about Paul Crump and his probable innocence of the crimes he was almost executed for five timesthe film interrogates ideas about how to treat criminals and how to evaluate crime that have been ingrained in the United States (and indeed, in countries across the globe) since its birth.  In a touching reversal of expectation, the prison warden gives an interview for the film in which he talks about how there ought to be a paradigmatic shift in favor of emphasizing the rehabilitation of prisoners, rather than of the punishment of prisoners. When the warden continues to talk at length of how Paul Crump had transformed while in prison (he even went from being barely literate when he first entered the cell to having written a book, Burn, Killer, Burn!, that was lauded by the likes of Gwendolyn Brooks), we must ask why Crump hadnt been worthy of the warden's praise all along, and what systems of oppression were at work to produce a man that needed rehabilitation in the first place.

The People vs. Paul Crump borders on docudrama at times, with its many reenactments that punctuate the conversation between Paul Crump and Daily News reporter John Justin Smithyou can tell that this is a work of a soon-to-be Oscar-winning director and of Bill Butler, a cinematographer who would go on to shoot Jaws.  But its aesthetic merits aside, Paul Crump is an innovative expos that in many ways presaged contemporary conversations over capital punishment, police brutality, and systemic, institutional racism in the U.S.  It may have taken almost a half-century for the death penalty to be abolished in Illinois, but this film in large part saved at least one man, likely innocent, from it.

This DVD, brilliantly restored, comes with a booklet that includes information on the production of the film, the restoration of the film, the case itself, an essay on Friedkin and the film, and excerpts from the original script that all underscore the importance of the film not only in film history but also in the history of violence and oppression under the U.S. legal system and society as a whole.",1436745600,5,2519,4.885245901639344
