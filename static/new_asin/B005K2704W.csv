8476457,1,B005K2704W,"I was excited about this product, because we had assembled our collection of Pasolini films during the VHS era.  It was nice to see them finally available on DVD.  This set was specifically described as being ""all region"", but, when I tried to play the movies, only one (""Canterbury Tales"") would play on my Sony DVD carousel. Each of the others gave me a ""could not read disc"" message that indicated the problem was with the coding for region.  I returned this set, and bought the three-disc Criterion Collection set (with only ""The Decameron"", ""Canterbury Tales"", and ""Arabian Nights"").",1358899200,2,588,4.91919191919192
