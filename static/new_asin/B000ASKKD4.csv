8079712,4,B000ASKKD4,"For Choy Lai Fut practitioners this DVD provides some valuable additional training ideas.  The DVD doesn't claim to be the complete basics needed to practice and learn Choy Li Fut.  This video provides excellent ideas to supplement Doc Fai Wong's series.  Over 25 years ago I studied Choy Li Fut with Yang style Tai Chi.  At the time I was already a black belt and instructor in the Korean martial arts (Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido) and the exploration and practice of Chinese martial arts greatly improved my learning / practice with new ideas.
This DVD is highly recommended for MA practitioners of all styles.",1498262400,,605,4.788461538461538
