In this film, he is quite excellent.  David Kalat's commentary, while sometimes bordering on mile-a-minute revisionism, does get it right in that this film is Langdon's apotheosis of stillness and minimalism.

The faults I can find with it are not the ones normally cited about poorly done pathos and matching (no one seems to notice this at the end of City Lights, by the way), but with continuity problems that might have been solved with the addition of the dream sequences at the beginning and some other scenes that we only know of from photographs.

""Three's a Crowd"" was Langdon's earnest attempt to emulate Chaplin's filmmaking style.

8261797,4,B0016A2FHE,"Critics and fans argue about Frank Capra's influence on Harry Langdon's career. For me, it is when Capra joins Langdon's crew that Langdon's innocent, childlike character achieves full bloom. For further proof, watch Three's A Crowd, the feature made after Capra's departure. It's a fascinating train wreck of a film, with some good gags and photography sunk by weak execution and writing elsewhere. The film could almost be inverted into a story about a young woman about to give birth, fleeing her dissipated husband and landing in a shabby little home with a shabby little man looking after her - reducing Langdon to a supporting role. As it is, Harry is the focus, turning the mother into a cipher, the baby into an excuse for gags, and attempts at pathos overwhelming the comedy. The Chaser, another post-Capra feature, is better but derivative of Harry's short comedies, and rather forgettable. I recommend this because the transfer is good, the music also, and fans of Harry Langdon ought to watch Three's A Crowd to see Langdon try and play auteur.",1353715200,,1056,4.938202247191011
8261798,3,B0016A2FHE,"Harry Langdon's self directed ""3's a Crowd"" (1927) is very good, although many disagree.

This is the interesting tale of Harry as a poor slum dwelling socially backward furniture mover who longs to have a family like his employer. He meets a pregnant lady in a snowstorm who is temporarily on the outs with her husband and takes her in before he gives birth. I'll stop here and let you figure out the rest.

This film is hated by many critics because of the heavy sentiment. I personally enjoyed it. Some really clever gags such as Harry tossing the doll in time with his employer playfully tossing his on in the air. The final (and unexpected) gag is also a good capper for the film. On the whole, the film is more interesting than funny. The gags bring occasional smiles as opposed to belly laughs. But I think it's still worth watching. Most people who are familiar with Jackie Gleason's masterpiece GIGOT (1962) say that it was inspired by Chaplin's THE KID. I disagree. I think that the similarities to THREE'S A CROWD are more apparent (poor socially scorned men who find ready made families with a would-be wife and child). Since John Herbert Gleason was born in 1916, it is likely that he would have seen this 1927 film as a child.

Then there is THE CHASER (1928). Pee-ooey! Harry must have gone to a farm to feed laxatives to the cows and filmed the results! What JUNK! This misfire mess nearly killed Harry's career!

This is where a more middle-class Harry is a rambling husband with a shrewish wife and nagging hawk-faced mother in law. They go to divorce court, but the judge (foreshadowing Tv judge ""Exterme Akim"" Anastopoulo 80 years later) orders Harry to wear a skirt and act like the wife for a month or go to jail! What the HECK?!

The gross indignities (salesmen, icemen, and milkmen making passes at Harry and his wife going so far as to bring her friends over to laugh at Harry's humiliation) lead Harry to attempt suicide (unsuccessfully of course). The story then takes a strange detour of Harry ditching the feminine attire to play golf and party with some beauties at the park. What was our man (and writer Arthur Ripley) thinking? Beleive it or not, they thought the public would go for this demolition derby of weirdness and bad taste.

This is all every bit as strange, senseless, and unfunny as it sounds. Far beneath the talents of an otherwise great comedian. 1928 critics and audiences were repelled by this garbage and you are likely to be also. Bad drama sometimes makes for good comedy, but bad comedy is good for nothing.

So see Three's a Crowd to see whether you agree on the merits of this film, and spend an hour of your life that you'll never get back with the abomination THE CHASER to see Harry as you've never seen him (and hope to never see again).",1320883200,,2796,4.557768924302789
8261799,5,B0016A2FHE,"Approaching Harry Langdon's Three's a Crowd is a loaded task. This film, possibly more than other from silent cinema, comes with an almost legendary amount of vehemently negative appendage. One time collaborator Frank Capra played the self-serving spin doctor in film history's assessment of Langdon and this film. He characterized Langdon's directorial debut as unchecked egotism run amok, resulting in a career destroying, poorly managed misfire and disaster.

That assessment is a grotesque and clueless mockery of film criticism.

The startlingly inept critical consensus, in it's failure to recognize this dark horse, existentialist, Tao masterpiece, reveals far more about reviewers than it does this film. The complete failure of that consensus to rise to Langdon's artistic challenges, to appreciate his risk taking towards a highly individualistic texture of this most compelling purist art of silent cinema, only serves to validate the inherent and prevailing laziness in the art of film criticism.

Capra's statements are frequently suspect. As superb a craftsman as Frank Capra was, he also made amazingly asinine, disparaging remarks regarding European film's penchant for treating the medium as an art form as opposed to populist entertainment. So, likewise, Capra's inability to fully grasp Langdon's desired aesthetic goals and intentions is both understandable and predictable. Samuel Beckett and James Agee are considerably far more trustworthy and reliable in regards to the artistry of Harry Langdon.

Capra credited himself for developing Langdon's character through several shorts, along with the features Strongman and Long Pants. Actually, Langdon had thrived as a vaudeville act for twenty years and had appeared in over a dozen shorts before he and Capra began their brief, ill-fated collaboration.

Aesthetically, Langdon was Capra's antithesis and the surprise is not that the two artists would have a falling out, or that Langdon's stardom would be over almost as soon as it began, but that he ever achieved stardom in the first place. Langdon began edging his character into darker territory in the Capra directed Long Pants, and it was this that lead to their inevitable break.

Three's a Crowd is quintessential Langdon unplugged and it's existence is almost a miracle.

Cubist, minimalist, enigmatic, avant-garde,personal, painterly,static, dream-like, lethargically paced, performance art: all these terms apply to Three's a Crowd.

The set pieces immediately convey the film's genteel, surreal aura.  A milkman, making his early delivery at dawn, is the only sign of life in an otherwise empty city street. Inside Harry's apartment, an alarm clock vibrates. The camera seems eerily frozen on the clock, almost as if a still photograph. Harry sits up in bed, half asleep,a long stillness envelops the scene. The street outside is now bustling with activity. Back inside the apartment, Harry still sits in that state between sleeping and waking. The alarm clock continues to vibrate. This establishes the character as one who is apart from the world around him. His face barely registers at all and only the slightest of gestures even indicates Harry is actually alive. An eyebrow is arched, the corner of his mouth oh so slowly curls upward.

Harry's boss, Arthur Thalasso, is outside, yelling, trying to wake his tardy employee. Soon, Thalasso's family is introduced, then poetically contrasted, with Harry's solitary existence and all consuming loneliness.

Harry discovers a beaten up rag doll; a metaphoric symbol for the sense of family which cruelly evades him.

Capra described the development of the Langdon persona as an innocent,who triumphs because he is protected by God.  Langdon takes away the divine safety net and took great risk in re-casting his character as a sort of dark-hued, sexually repressed, perennial loser Charlie Brown, alternately attractive to and rejected by women. Despite doing everything right and having the most noble of intentions, this Voltaire-worthy Harry completely fails, and idea is the Divine has a sadistic last laugh at his pathetic creation's futile attempts.

In addition to inanimate objects (the rag doll), Langdon uses nature's animals and references to animals to metaphorically compound the salt rubbed into the wounds of his much put upon character. A pigeon brings an anonymous love letter to Thalasso's wife. Thalasso is convinced it comes from Langdon and a chase ensues.  Later, when Langdon discovers a nearly dead half-frozen girl, who he believes to the woman of his dreams, he deduces she is pregnant and ready to deliver. He looks up at her, lying in the safety of his bed, then at the booties in her blanket, then back up at the woman, then at the booties again. His face is still frozen, much as she was frozen, for what seems like the longest moment, as he is methodically taking it all in. Finally, he registers a slight twitch and drops the spoonful of medicine he is about to give her. He flees his apartment, down the long, warped stairway that is shown repeatedly throughout the film. He opens a window and yells inside, ""Help, Storks!"" An army of women and doctors swarm his apartment, keeping him outside, standing so alone, unsure what to do next.

He has a toy rifle, a drum set, various toys, all for this miracle gift of a holy child, but stands there for half an eternity in complete confusion and bewilderment.

Like Saul consulting the soothsayer, Harry consults a palm reader, to assure him this is all going to turn out all right, that the woman's husband will not return to claim the wife and child who are, for the moment, Harry's dream of a family finally personified.

However, like Saul, Harry is at the mercy of God's humor and, indeed, the husband does indeed return to claim what is his. A surreal dream, a boxing match between Langdon and the husband refereed by Thalasso is only witnessed by the prized woman and child, encased in an opaque, blackened world. Harry wears an over-sized boxing glove, looks at this dream family with the slightest of smiles, points to his glove, then to the husband, slow blinks as the husband strikes a highly theatrical battle pose and...

...Naturally, Harry loses and his dream family is taken away. When the woman of his dreams embraces her husband, Harry looks ups at them, in complete silence, looks at his palm, reminded of the oh so cruel, oh so wrong prediction, then back at this real family, utterly helpless.

Harry returns to the palm reading shop. He raises the brick in his hand to smash the windows, thinks better of it, raises his hand again, decides not to after all and discards the brick, only to see it fly into a wine barrel, which goes crashing into the shop window. Harry retreats up the long winding stairway to disappear into the safety of his lonely home, his dreams as smashed as that window.

The bleakness of Three's a Crowd is worthy of Beckett, rivals the best of Chaplin, and stands apart as THE unjustly maligned, hopelessly misunderstood, dark horse masterpiece of silent cinema. Fans of silent comedy have often expressed disappointment in this film, citing that it is simply not funny. Similarly, Tom Hanks fans initially resisted his venturing past the expected comedies. Three's a Crowd defies genre. It is not a comedy, but the purest expression of Langdon's standout art,which refuses to be pigeonholed. Langdon got his start in film at a much later age than his contemporaries and he always seemed the antithesis of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd; so his evolution into something even starker, less definable, was the most predictable outcome of Langdon's career, and then only in retrospect.  It is unfortunate that Langdon was not permitted to develop his art and character, but it's almost a miracle he was allowed to in the first place and this resulting film is his testament. Many of his earlier films for Mack Sennett, while uniquely different, still seem very much expressions of their time, as do the Capra films, but Three's a Crowd went further and, consequently, stands out and alone as an original, modernist misfit work. Its, and Langdon's, time has come.

* The Chaser (1928) was Harry Langdon`s second directorial feature for First National studios. His third and final feature, Heart Trouble (1928) is considered lost. The few who did see Heart Trouble claimed that it could have restored Langdon to prominence. However, by then First National had written their star off, canceled his contract and punished his risk-taking by yanking Heart Trouble. In most likelihood the studio destroyed all the copies.

In his review of Chuck Harter and Michael Hayde's book ""Little Elf: A Celebration of Harry Langdon,"" Leonard Maltin writes: ""Harter and Hayde are so pro-Langdon that they feel it necessary to disparage Frank Capra [who directed Langdon's first film] at every opportunity... the authors take heavy-handed swipes at Capra at every opportunity, ignoring the fact that Langdon's features did take a nosedive after the collaborators parted company. I remember sitting with an audience stunned into silence as we watched Three's a Crowd and The Chaser when Raymond Rohauer first presented them theatrically in 1971. They are painfully unfunny. There were other factors that worked against these late-silent features aside from Capra's departure, but Langdon was not destined to succeed as his own producer, as this book explores in detail.""

Maltin, in his turn, takes the tried and true route of putting Capra on a pedestal, while failing to grasp the nature of Langdon's art as Langdon envisioned it. Neither of Langdon's surviving features attempt to be typical period comedies. While Capra's status as a consummate commercial filmmaker is well deserved, his numerous comments regarding European film, experimentalism, and film as an art form are embarrassingly sophomoric.  Capra's bourgeoisie elitism is so pronounced as to render useless his comments regarding Langdon's aesthetic choices.

The European avant-garde and the Surrealists predictably had a better grasp on what Langdon was trying to accomplish.  A revealing example might be found in Wheeler Dixon's ""The Films of Jean-Luc Godard."" Dixon writes that for the script of his film, Prenom: Carmen (1983) Godard cited Beethoven's notebooks, Rodin's sculptures and Harry Langdon as inspirations.

In his New Yorker review of The Chaser, Richard Brody writes: ""as a director, Langdon was far more radical and original than Capra ever was, which accounts for the audience's rejection of his films. Three's a Crowd, from 1927, is a grimly Sisyphean comedy of a lonely man in quest of a family, and its slapstick brilliance is smeared with a mire of poverty that few dramas could rival. In The Chaser, Langdon's directorial originality fuses remarkably with his unique performance style: he gives himself long, static, and obsessional closeups of a sort that wouldn't be seen again until the rise of the overtly modernist cinema of the nineteen-sixties. It's time to remember Langdon as a director, too.""

As with Three's a Crowd, Arthur Ripley provided the story for The Chaser. The movie opens with wife (Gladys McConnel) berating Husband (Langdon) on the telephone. Husband claims to be at the lodge, but it is past 8:30! Wife's Mother (Helen Hayward)  joins her daughter in castigating Husband. Langdon's camera lingers on Wife and Mother's chastising for such an extended time, that it becomes progressively surreal, like a dissonant string duet. Langdon cuts to Husband, on his end, doing nothing for an elongated span of time. Eventually, Husband lethargically emerges from his lifelessness, but until then, the scene could almost pass for a still photograph. Actually, as we soon learn, Husband is engaging in voyeurism at a hedonistic party. Husband does not join in the activities himself. His lack of reaction on the telephone, coupled with his failure to join the party, strongly suggest an impotent character, an idea which will be reinforced later.

Wife and Mother go to court. Judge (Charles Thurston) denies a divorce and instead sentences Husband to 30 days of gender reassessment. Simply put, Judge forces Husband to be Wife for a month, while Wife gets to be husband. The inserts of newspaper headlines, announcing Judge's sentence on Husband are intentionally childlike, as if culled from a dream.

From hre, The Chaser becomes postmodern.

Now parading around the house in a skirt, Husband (now Wife) sends Wife (now Husband) off to work.

A bill collector arrives, seeking a year-long overdue payment for a baby carriage. Wife calls Husband to ask. Absolutely not. We will not be needing it. The impotent Langdon is forced to return the familial dream.

After the amorous bill collector is sent a packing, the iceman cometh. After the iceman sneaks a kiss, Langdon decides on suicide. A long extended sequence on various methods of attempted self-destruction follows. When all else fails, go play golf with a buddy from the party.

Shorn of  his skirt and adorned in his swashbuckling lodge outfit, Langdon reclaims his manhood with a near lethal kiss planted on a couple of bathing beauties at the golf course. This, of course, sends him back to Wife fully revived.

A sequence involving Husband mistaken for a ghost will later influence Stan Laurel.

A small slice of Langdon's late 1920 audience had stayed with him. However, the site of the star in drag, mistakenly believing he has laid an egg and attempting suicide, rendered them aghast. The Chaser sent Langdon's dwindling audience packing.

Posthumously, Langdon had his defenders . The critic James Agee was among them. In his Life magazine essay, Agee wrote: ""Langdon had one queerly toned, unique little reed, but out of it he could get incredible melodies. Whatever else the others might be doing, they all used more or less elaborate physical comedy; Langdon showed how little of that one might use and still be a great silent-screen comedian. Twitches of his faces were signals of tiny discomforts too slowly registered by a tinier brain; quick, squirty little smiles showed his almost prehuman pleasures, his incurably premature trustfulness. He was a virtuoso of hesitations and of delicately indecisive motions. He was as remarkable a master as Chaplin of subtle emotional and mental process and operated much more at leisure.""

8261800,2,B0016A2FHE,"Ideas like ""Langdon never really understood the character he played on screen"" are unoriginal canards, and after watching many Langdon films, I do not see the evidence for this odd theory, nor many of the criticisms about his later silent films--or even his sound films.  I think this film, and its other black-sheep sibling ""The Chaser"" have more going for them than writers generally credit them for.

With silent films, any new understandings of a work usually come from the quality and completeness of the print, and the perceptiveness of the soundtrack.  These Kino prints are very good and very complete (read other reviews for details).  In fact, too complete: these movies really need re-editing.  The music works to a degree...

THREE'S A CROWD:
Kino must take pride in giving us silent movies with out-of-sync sound tracks.  (For example, the Robert Israel music for Kino's 2-DVD box set of ""The General"" goes so far as 2 seconds late in the middle of the film.)  At the beginning of ""Three's A Crowd"", you can actually hear the organist trilling the sound of Harry's alarm clock--15 seconds before we see the clock.  The alarm-clock music occurs at 1:45 in the film, but you don't see the close-up of the clock ringing until 2:00, well AFTER the sound has COMPLETELY STOPPED!!  In scene II, things are a little better: the soundtrack seems to be only 5 seconds early, instead of 15.  After that, it appears to be in-sync, although Erwin's music rarely fits the action at all, either because he is overly subtle or the music is actually still out of sync--I guess I'll never know.  I will admit that the sound of the organ is very suitable to this film, and overall the music--as background music--strikes me as generally appropriate to the mood of the movie.  It is minimal music to a minimalist film. And it may have been what Langdon was after.

Watched as a character study, not a farce, I found ""Three's..."" to be curious, absorbing, and then haunting.  With a truly insightful soundtrack and a little editing to fix the botched matching shots, it would be a very effective movie.

I have never found Langdon to be a belly-laugh comedian, just mesmerizing to watch.  Maybe that's why I was not disappointed, as opposed to those who claim that the film lacks jokes and is ""not funny"".  Like some of the ""weaker"" Laurel and Hardy movies from the Hal Roach era, the less a script gave them to do, the more they relied on their character acting, which was what made them special.  In this movie, it's almost all about character, and since I can't stop watching Langdon once he gets going, I was content.

The cinematography is excellent, the choice of shots is sensitive, and the editing (in terms of which shots are chosen and in what order) is often elegant, if occasionally sloppy (there are numerous shots where the actors finish an action, then repeat it in the next shot, because the two shots were not cut to match properly).

The entire section with the terrible nitrate damage does not even include any recognizable actors, so the whole sequence could be easily re-filmed, in 16mm, and in that way restored.  I hope someday someone does this, perhaps with a few added shots drawn from Langdon's original storyboard, and maybe the film will then reveal even more about itself.  In the meantime, I suggest skipping the doll section, if your computerized DVD player allows.

Watch it when you are not in a mental hurry, approach it with no expectations, sit back and relax.

THE CHASER
There are moments in this film that actually made me laugh out loud, which is unusual for me while watching a Langdon film.  If the organist were Robert Vaughn, or even Robert Israel, this movie might come alive.  Lee Erwin's dour and uninspired organ work practically kills the movie and makes it a little difficult to assess what exactly we do have here.

I'm giving this DVD a rating of 2 stars out of a complicated formulae: I'm inclined to give 4 stars to ""Three's A Crowd"", as a movie; I give 3 stars to the organwork for ""Three"", but a NEGATIVE-1 star to Kino for bad sync; 1-1/2 stars for the organwork for ""Chaser""; 5 stars for Kino for putting out this DVD in the first place; and I at this time have no idea how to rate ""Chaser"" as a movie.  EVEN at a 2-star rating, I HIGHLY recommend BUYING THIS, if you are at all a silent-film history buff or a Langdon fan.

So, if you already know Langdon's other silent work and are interested in these two movies, by all means do go ahead and buy this.  But let's hope someday someone restores ""Three"" and sets both films to better soundtracks.  MUCH better soundtracks...  Or at least re-syncs the ones they have now.

UPDATE: December 2010
I tried viewing The Chaser by watching only certain sections, and not others, and I find it much more coherent, and highly entertaining.  If you can do it (perhaps with your computer): stop watching at the point the wife buries her head in her hands, sobbing, and go from there past the entire section of morning headlines ""Man Commits Suicide"" and the stuff with the judge.  Start up again where the Wife and the Mother-In-Law go for a drive to look for Harry.  Once again, stop watching after Harry and Bud, on the golf course, run in a panic from the ""grave site"", and go directly to Harry putting back on his dress in the car.  NOW the movie makes a lot of sense, and it's not so long, dragged down by the meaningless scene with the bathing beauties.  If you could also find a way to skip the repetitive and unnecessary shots at the beginning of the film (of the two women yelling into the telephone), and skip similarly repetitive shots later in the movie, the film would move along much more briskly and becomes, in my lowly opinion, one of his better works! (Langdon edits his films much the same as his film personae reacts to the world around him: with many hesitations and repetitions.  Interesting for his character, deadly for an editing technique.)",1265932800,5,5958,4.626425855513308
8261801,3,B0016A2FHE,"If you're unfamiliar with Harry Langdon's work, this is not the place to start. If you've never cared for Langdon, neither THREE'S A CROWD or THE CHASER will alter your opinion of this quirky, acquired-taste performer. I admire Kino for releasing this limited-interest disc that won't appeal to a wide market. If the overly sentimental THREE'S A CROWD and the darkly humorous THE CHASER are personal statements (both were directed by Langdon), they're statements that will challenge and most likely alienate viewers. Both films reveal a popular silent-era comedian exploring different facets of his established character, deconstructing conventional narrative contexts in the process. The results are as fascinating as they may be (for most viewers) off-putting, and only the most dedicated film scholars and diehard Langdon fans may be willing to take the plunge.

Kino did a fine job of presenting this material, presenting HD masters derived from surviving 35mm negatives. Nitrate decomposition is quite evident during brief passages of THREE'S A CROWD, a reminder that it's fortunate for movie history that this film survived at all. (As noted, these passages are brief and the rest of the picture is in generally excellent shape.) Because of decomposition, portions of THE CHASER were mastered from 16mm source material.

Regardless of how unfunny THREE'S A CROWD may strike most people, even the harshest critics will have to admit that it's a beautifully-made motion picture. (The camerawork is stunning.) This disc is ideally suited for devoted Langdonphiles and serious (very serious) students of silent cinema, who will be able to look at these pictures in their proper context and will appreciate Kino's dedication to their consumer base. However, if you're simply looking for the standard type of silent-comedy fare like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd or the earlier Langdon efforts, you'll be better served elsewhere.",1262476800,8,1944,5.412541254125412
8261802,2,B0016A2FHE,"As a Langdon enthusiast for over 30 years I loved the Lost Langdon films DVD. But seeing THE CHASER & THREE'S A CROWD, it was embarassing. David Kalt's commentary sounds like some film nerd with such over the top comparisons with Picasso paintings,existentialism, etc. You have to love Langdon to relate to these 2. They are not bad, but far from his best. Very self absorbed in his directing & acting;so out of touch with how to relate to the audience at this point. That's what makes this frustrating to watch, but his later sound shorts were not bad, as in the Lost Films DVD.",1229472000,,579,4.523809523809524
8261803,4,B0016A2FHE,"Don't buy these if they are you first Harry Langdon purchase.  These are for people that GET Harry already.  I had read so much about Three's a Crowd (I think I read too much) I was expecting this profane, sad masterpiece and I watched it and I didn't get that feeling from it.  I had heard that The Chaser was the ""more Harry"" of the movies and was a more appreciated movie by the audience of the day.  So I watched it and you know it's not a great favourite of mine.

So I waited a little and rewatched both movies again and I came away from Threes a Crowd knowing that it is a mastepiece! This is The Little Elf at his best, the innocence and trust, the child, the man all mixed in together. The ""nightmare"" scene is so amazing. I cannot tell you how much I really love this movie, it goes beyond comedy!

This man was a genius and I really wished that he could have gone on further with his ideas.  This is when the film industry gets in the way of making great films. I know it's all about $ but don't you wish that Harry had the money and resources of a Chaplin or Lloyd so that he could have made his movies like he wanted to0!  Ah but I wish that so much for Keaton too!",1228435200,8,1178,4.004273504273504
8261804,5,B0016A2FHE,"Having read some reviews and other materials on Langdon, I prepared myself to be disappointed by Three's a Crowd. And, true, the opening sequences, in which the camera seemed stuck on the sleepy Langdon, holding the shots way too long, seemed to portend an excruciatingly boring experience. But, boy, was I wrong! I absolutely love this film! Okay, maybe one can't quite call it a comedy, though there are many funny ""moments"" (as opposed to sequences or set pieces, though there are a couple of those as well), but there is an amazing sense of telling detail. While I agree that there are some plot points that go nowhere (the pigeon literally coming out of the blue), I disagree with the general view that Langdon didn't understand his own screen persona. Harry Langdon was a wonderfully subtle actor; there is not a false gesture or expression in the entire film.
The photography too is breath-taking; the sets of that little dead-end community are indelibly designed. I immediately watched the film again, this time with the very enthusiastic commentary by David Kalat, and appreciated it even more. I guess I do see why it wasn't successful at the time of its release -- it does move very slowly, does not build to a rousing slapstick climax, and the ending will break your heart. But it's a one of a kind film that was made with great care and love. If Andy Kaufman had teamed up with Guy Maddin, you might have something like Three's a Crowd.",1224547200,6,1449,4.686274509803922
