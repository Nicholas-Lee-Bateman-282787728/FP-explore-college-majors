True fans will never forget the action pack thrills provided us by such greats as Mark Lewin, The Sheik, Bobo Brazil, Terry Funk and Andre the Giant. Memories like these are definitely worth adding to your DVD collection of the true mat action that is a rarity these days.",1509667200,,462,4.511904761904762

8627259,5,B00GT28XWA,"Loved the DVD, the matches on there are one of a kind and absolutely enjoyed watching the matches involving the original Sheik; who in my opinion created Hardcore Wrestling. Also the documentary building up to a match between The Sheik and BOBO Brazil is a must watch and can be found on YouTube to be exact.",1445385600,,308,4.517857142857143
