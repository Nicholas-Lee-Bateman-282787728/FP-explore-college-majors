7672671,3,B01C6KIKY4,"Teen Titans Go!: Eat, Dance, Punch! - Season 3, Part 1 contains 26 animated adventures of DC Comics Teen Titans  Robin, Cyborg, Raven, Starfire, and Beast Boy. Each episode combines action with humor as the young heroes band together to fight crime and deal with everyday adolescent issues.

Though the show appeals primarily to young viewers, it also contains humor directed at adults, which makes the show much more fun than other animated kids programs. With episodes running a mere 12 minutes, the stories are tightly scripted and fast-paced, making them perfect for those who enjoy their animation compactly packaged and cleverly written.

The limited animation is typical of Cartoon Network shows. Motion occurs only in key parts of the frame, such as mouths moving when characters speak or body parts moving when action calls for it. Older viewers who grew up with the Disney style of fluid animation, as seen in Snow White, Bambi and Pinocchio, might have to get used to the style, but the humor and the exploits of the diverse set of characters should more than make up for the less-costly animation technique.

Episodes on the 2-disc DVD release include A Cats Fancy, The Dignity of Teeth, The Spice Game, Grubes Fairytales, Squash & Stretch, Secret Garden, The True Meaning of Christmas, and Pyramid Scheme.",1464652800,3,1318,5.004566210045662
7672672,5,B01C6KIKY4,"This show makes me laugh harder than most other shows on TV.  If you like cartoons with adult humor hidden in it, this show is for you.  Plus the episodes are only 12 minutes long so you don't have to lay out a bunch of time watching these shows.  By far my favorite character is Beast Boy, followed by Cyborg.  But they all are funny.  Anyone who likes Cartoon Network's animation (but may have gotten burned out in the past) should give this show a try, I truly believe it will hook you.  Plus all the references to other stuff ('Dragonball Z', 'Back to the Future', 'Scooby Doo', and MUCH more) will keep you entertained.  Plus this show is fine for young kids to watch, so no fear on having the kids with you on this one (it's funny for kids 3 to 100).  -Enjoy  **Fingers crossed I will like the 'Teen Titans vs Justice League' movie.",1460332800,4,838,4.286624203821656
7672673,5,B01C6KIKY4,"Well it started as any addiction does. Watching it here and there with my boys. Then I found myself thinking about it and laughing to myself. Next I was watching the whole 1st and 2nd seasons when my boys were at school! It is funny for children but has enough ""elbow jabs"" for adults. Not only do I LOVE IT but my boys love it as well. To the point that they re-watch the seasons over and over. You always seem to catch something you didn't see the last time you watched. Oh, the songs are hilarious and annoyingly catchy. Already have Season 3 pre-ordered! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up... Definitely would recommend.",1459209600,9,610,4.407079646017699
7672674,5,B01C6KIKY4,"I love Teen Titans Go! This show is funny, cute, and crazy! I believe that if people would give this wonderful and crazy show a chance they would realize that Teen Titans Go is awesome and a fantastic show. I've been a fan since the show first came out! This show gets 5 Stars and 10/10! Teen Titans Go! Fan forever!

7672675,5,B01C6KIKY4,"My 6 & 12 year old sons love this series!!  (The parents are known to sit down and watch as well!!)  When trying to decide which DVD to purchase, I just searched the Teen Titans Go! site that has each DVD with episodes listed.  My 12 year old helped point out the episodes we have watched on TV that cracked us up the most.  (We skip the episodes with Raven's dad - he can be a bit scary for the 6 year old.)

As far as current cartoons go, Teen Titans Go! is one we all enjoy as much as the old Looney Tunes.  It not only good for kids and teens, but parents can enjoy the 80's humor that comes in from time to time.  The only other current cartoon series that I can handle is The Amazing World of Gumball  (remember; we have 2 boys in our house.)

My sons can say some scenes word for word and we crack up every time they do because the humor is just that funny.  (Disclaimer:  There is a bit of ""potty humor"" in these episodes.  Come on - three of the five characters are TEEN BOYS!!! Our house is comprised with easy-going people, meaning; we're not so stiff that we can't enjoy the simpler (and stupid) things in life.  That being said; if you are prone to being a stiff, this, among other things, is not going to make you laugh.)",1492560000,,1235,4.074688796680498
7672676,1,B01C6KIKY4,"I DONT CARE IF THE FANS OF THIS SHOW CALL ME HATEFUL OR EVIL FOR SIDING WITH THE HIVE AND THE OTHER ASSORTED ""VILLAINS"" BUT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE A SIDE..AND IVE MADE MY CHOICE. THE ""VILLAINS"" ARE MUCH MORE FUN TO WATCH ANYWAY. THE EPISODES ARE NOT WORTH MENTIONING AND THE CREATORS OF THIS SHOW CAN'T TAKE ANY SORT OF CRITICISM. SO I ONLY WATCH THIS SHOW FOR THE ""VILLAINS"" AND I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE IF ANYONE GETS THEIR FEELINGS HURT BY WHAT I'VE SAID HERE. I LIKE VILLAINS!! THESE TEEN TITANS BEHAVE LIKE JERKS ANYWAY.",1491782400,,525,4.313131313131313

7672681,5,B01C6KIKY4,Teen Titans Go! is a fun show.  I also got the original series of Teen Titans while both are great in their own right this one is by far the most silly and fun of the two.  You get to see the team in their daily life (as heroes and as people).  I can't wait till Season 3 PT2 comes out and then 4 etc...  I hope it continues for a long while.
