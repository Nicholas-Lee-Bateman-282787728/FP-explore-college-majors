8524021,5,B0081L6NH4,"The Cuckoo's Nest was a punk club, right next to a Cowboy bar.  I used to go there around 1981 and we'd (us punks) get into fights with the cowboys at Zubie's, which at the time had an ""Urban Cowboy"" snob attitude, written brilliantly into a song ""Urban Struggle"", by The Vandals.  These were really great times for the punk scene, which no one remembers.

Long live Stevo!",1398038400,,373,4.455882352941177
8524022,3,B0081L6NH4,The movie was alright and just took alot of the footage from the previous documentary Urban Struggle. Also the audio was kinda messed up during the interviews with Jack Grisham.,1358640000,,177,4.933333333333334
8524023,5,B0081L6NH4,This movie is an awesome look back into my teenage years. Im interviewed in the movie 3 times. I grew up at the cookoos nest and have the best memories of the place. Seen just about any band that you can think of from 1979-1982. Kudos to Jerry Roach for providing an outlet for our angst. Hell slam dancing was invented at the nest. Without the cookoos nest there would have been no orange county punk scene. Thank you Jerry Roach.,1350777600,3,431,4.333333333333333
8524024,4,B0081L6NH4,"I started getting into punk in 1982 (i.e. the year after the Cuckoo's Nest was shut down,) but back then it was mostly about hanging out in my best friend's bedroom listening to records and reading Flipside. We were only 13 and left to our own devices; actually going out to gigs was a little beyond us. Too bad, we were born and bred in Fullerton and probably could have had a swell time at the Galaxy. Anyway, eventually I did start going to gigs and mixing it up and meeting punks who had been in the scene for years. One thing almost all of these upper classmen had in common was great stories about the Cuckoo's Nest, all of the classic hardcore bands, all of the mayhem and f***ing s*** up that went on, getting messed with by cops and rednecks from the bar next door, how they personally knew *The* Pat Brown... it always made me wish I was a few years older. So with those memories in mind, this documentary is perfect for me. I can almost pretend I was there.

There are some choice bits of live footage from 1979 to 1981 of the Ramones, the Circle Jerks, TSOL, even Black Flag (so either Greg Ginn has lightened up on his b.s. or when he finds out he's going to get litigious...) Lots of old interview footage. I guess the black & white stuff is all recycled from the short doc Urban Struggle from back then, which I vaguely recall watching at someone's house once. In a way, I guess this more or less a ""30 years later"" update to that. Overall, the quality isn't so hot. I don't know if my copy of the DVD is defective, but every so often it would freeze and hang for a couple of seconds, as if the laser was having trouble tracking the data. I kept expecting the screen to go black and get the ""Unable to Play Disc"" error message but thankfully that never happened.

Also, I get that this is intended to focus specifically on the Nest... but it gives the impression that it was the one and only club going for hardcore gigs. If a sociologist was to find this video a few decades from now, they'd think the Cuckoo's Nest was the only hardcore venue in the entire world. Even if it was the only one in OC at the time, it's not as if LA was more than 30-45 minutes away.

All in all this is a truly great document and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the classic first wave of the hardcore scene, back when it actually meant something.",1350000000,6,2357,4.221729490022173
8524025,5,B0081L6NH4,"This film was a labor of serious effort for all of the participants. A 40 year journey that started with Jerry Roach opening what he thought was going to be a 'bar' and ending right hear, with this little film that takes it's rightful place in the pantheon of punk rock docs. The Cuckoo's Nest was important, this story is important. I don't claim punk rock. I'm a filmmaker and story teller. I approached this film from that perspective. You don't have to be a punker to find this film entertaining, engaging and...even moving. It's a story of a place and time that continues to resonate long past whatever expiration date the property had. I hope you buy it, watch it, share it and enjoy it. Jonathan W.C. Mills - Director",1344816000,6,724,4.534351145038168
