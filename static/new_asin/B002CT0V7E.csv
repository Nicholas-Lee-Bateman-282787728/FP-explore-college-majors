8364400,4,B002CT0V7E,"More than a terrific swing tutorial, this bonus-packed set chronicles a fascinating chapter in 20th century dance.  84 and 82 years young, Jean Veloz and brother Ray Phelps can still out-style Lindy Hoppers a third their age - something they prove while sharing their trademark moves on Disc 1 with Rusty Frank and Ron Campbell (two of L.A.'s finest swing instructors).

Equally engaging is Disc 2, in which Jean and Ray share memories of the 1940s swing scene and the artists they encountered - a conversation enhanced by rare photos and galvanizing film clips.  Finally, there's a full episode of the live '50s TV series featuring Jean and her future husband, ballroom champ Frank Veloz.  Part variety show, part dance competition, it's a perfect coda for this labor-of-love collection of dance history.",1245369600,,805,5.075757575757576
