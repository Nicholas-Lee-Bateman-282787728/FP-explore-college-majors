8760474,5,B01F8YAH6O,I'd seen Riding the Bullet before but had never seen Big Driver as a movie. It was graphic but really had to be to convey the horror of the storyline. Nice twist that I was kinda expecting but still surprised to have my suspicions verified. Excellent ending--love revenge movies. Maria Bello was superb. This movie will become one of my top 5 favorites.,1535760000,,353,4.619047619047619
8760475,3,B01F8YAH6O,"A DVD is A DVD.  I like the content and I added it to my extensive collection in hopes of the day that I can shut down DirectTV, as for the DVD itself being good or bad, that I won't know until I watch it and that will be beyond any warranty date, so my review doesn't really matter.",1528502400,,283,3.7966101694915255
