8653446,4,B00JQYUSH6,"Flash back to 70's monster movies.  If you think a kid yelling Jet Jaguar! and a bad guy wearing a toga are funny, then Godzilla vs Megalon is great. Destroy all Monsters is the classic, but I was disappointed that there wasn't more monster action.  I bought his to see how Destroy All Monsters compared to Godzilla: Final Battle (same plot). Of the two Godzilla vs Megalon is more entertaining.",1521158400,,395,4.628571428571429

8653451,5,B00JQYUSH6,"Two of my favorite classics brought together on one disc.

Destroy all Monsters  directed by Ishir Honda  was an all star monster film that featured many of the Godzilla friends and enemies.
One of the best music scores of any of the classic Godzilla movies in my personal opinion.

Godzilla vs. Magalon was a great fun film for any young fan or hard-core enthusiast.

This is a great gift for any Godzilla fan or just any fan of the  vintage Japanese sci-fi films.",1469232000,2,465,4.542168674698795
