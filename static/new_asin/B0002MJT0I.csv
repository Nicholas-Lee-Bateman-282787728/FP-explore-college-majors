2105193,5,B0002MJT0I,"This movie is one of the best horror comedies of alltime, this is one of two movies that i have actually laughed outloud at[the other is donnie darko]. this movie actually seems more like day of the dead than dawn, I'd tell you why but I might spoil the ending, the basic point of this movie is:

shaun has a very sh*tty life, his girlfriend recently dumped him, his mother married a man he despises, and he only visits her bi-monthly he works in an appliance store, and has one up-tight room mate, and one dead-beat room mate. his life, in fact, is so sh*tty it takes him a few days to even realize that zombies have begun to take over england, but when he finds it out, its a record throwin, skull bashin, jaguar stealin, wall climbin, flesh eatin, good time, I cant wait to see it again!",1095465600,6,790,4.302013422818792
2105194,2,B0002MJT0I,"Its too slow! That is why I gave it a low rating: it drags on.

A couple funny spots, a couple gory spots and thats about it. If you want this type of movie, stick with ""dead alive"" ""evil dead 2"" ""night of the living dead 2""",1094947200,7,224,3.765957446808511
2105195,4,B0002MJT0I,"Having purchased the region 2 dvd of Shaun Of The Dead from Amazon.co.uk last week and watching the film last night (9/10/04), I can honestly say that this film should find some cult status in the US. Horror fans will like it as well as comedy fans. It may divide some people who can't deal with humor & gore in the same film, but that's their loss. Being a HUGE fan of the British series Spaced (also directed by Edgar Wright and written/starring Simon Pegg), I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it a second time today and it's still entertaining. Simon Pegg is on the verge of breaking out in the US and Edgar Wright is an amazing talent for such a young director. His filming style is flawless and this movie is a nice start to what I hope is a lucrative career for everyone involved. See this movie in theaters September 24th!",1094860800,9,833,4.380645161290323
2105196,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun is 29 year old. He has a mum, a stepfather he doesn't get along with, a girlfriend, Liz, and a best mate, Ed. Liz's friends Dianne and Dave don't like him much. She herself thinks Ed is a bad influence on him and wishes they didn't all spend every night getting drunk down the Winchester. So she dumps him. Understandably distressed, Shaun spends the following night getting enormously drunk with Ed to the great annoyance of their flatmate Pete.  The next morning he wakes up with a very sore head to find the dead have risen from their graves and the world is being taken over by zombies.

This is terrific fun, a very likeable, very British comedy horror film, sharply written and extremely well acted. Penelope Wilton and Nick Frost are especially good as, respectively, Shaun's good-natured mum and Ed, his impossible to dislike idle waster of a best friend. Think ""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""Withnail and I"" and you'll sort of get the idea. Well worth going out of your way to see.",1094601600,12,999,4.606741573033708
2105197,4,B0002MJT0I,"At long last!  A British comedy we can proudly send out to the whole world without fear of being pigeon-holed as a bunch of posh bumbling idiots.  The cast may all be new faces to the American audience, but over here they have become the Monty Pythons of this generation through great shows like Spaced, The Office and Black Books.  The ""RomZomCom"" (romantic-zombie-comedy) genre is a little misleading and that's the only reason that this film doesn't get 5 stars in my opinion.  The romance part of the film is a very thin veil over what is an hilarious and very gory film.  The jokes come thick and fast from the two main stars of the film (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) and having seen the pair of them from the early days of their careers (especially Simon Pegg whilst working with Steve Coogan) it comes as no surprise that they have made the transition to the big screen without losing what seems a very natural humour.  I suppose the zombie part of the film could be a little disjointed if you take the film too seriously, but if you start watching the film with an open mind (and a sense of humour!!) you will be rewarded with a fantastic modern British comedy (without Hugh Grant or Colin Firth!!).  Finally, I think that the use of music in the film is by far the best I've ever heard.  Zombie bashing to the Queen classic ""Don't Stop Me Now"" is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.",1094428800,8,1408,4.367816091954023
2105198,5,B0002MJT0I,"Really I must take issue with Mr Watson below who doesn't seem to offer any remotely sensible reason for disliking the movie but is clearly down on it for some reason only known to him. P.S Does anyone really care when his birthday is - I think not!

SOTD is a very fine piece of work which works on so many levels. Whether it is gross out horror, very black comedy, homage or social commentary. I can't think of any comparable movie that has captured the mind numbing boredom of suburban British life. This is revealed most brilliantly in the way the zombies blend in so well early on that Shaun, family and friends fail to notice anything has changed. This is not to say the film makers have even the slightest inclination to show a better world. There is a decidedly very British strain of humour running throughout that should still travel well; it is gentler and more subtlely probing. I particularly liked the bit when Bill Nighy downplays his injury stating he had his inoculations when he holidayed on the 'isle of wight'.

This really is a unique piece of work and I for one hope it is a roaring success when it is released stateside.",1093910400,6,1143,4.490384615384615
2105199,5,B0002MJT0I,"I was lucky enough to get invited to a sample screening of Shaun of the Dead back in June.  It was free and i was able to bring a guest, so i figured i would check it out.  It was probably one of the best decisions i've made this year.

  The movie does start off a bit slow, but once the zombies appear, be prepared to laugh your butt off!  The accents are a bit heavy, but bearable.

  I already have plans to see it again the day it comes out. I highly reccomend this flick to anyone who needs a good laugh.",1093824000,3,510,3.8737864077669903
2105200,5,B0002MJT0I,"As seen when released on (too few) British screens in April: a really funny horror comedy that appeals as much to your Superior Homo Sapiens cortex that will laugh at the derisive comment that modern life isn't too far removed from brainless-foaming-at-the-mouth afterlife as to your Instinctive animal brain that will make you feel spooked when the flesh-eating zombies close in. And for the really squeemish, yes there is a lot of brain splattering as you can only ""kill"" the walking dead by removing their brains or similarly smash their heads, which Shaun and friends attempt to do with anything at hand (though most hilariously a collection of old LPs).

All in all tasteless good fun has never bbeen so good.",1093305600,2,714,4.900826446280992
2105201,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)

The same team that brought you Spaced is back with their first feature film, and a beautiful, beautiful thing it is. It's been far too long (almost twenty years) since anyone played zombies for straight comedy with any success whatsoever. That dry spell is officially over, and you can thank Simon Pegg.

Shaun (Pegg, recently seen in Band of Brothers and one of Brass Eye's specials, as well as Spaced) is Simon, an appliance store clerk with little ambition beyond buying coffee, hanging out at the pub, and playing videogames with his best friend Ed (Nick Frost, also a Spaced regular). His relationship with Liz (Kate Ashfield, last seen in America in The War Zone) is on the rocks, but what's a bloke to do?

Shaun's life would probably be just the same now, had it not been for, well, a plague of zombies. Shaun and Ed, after stumbling through the first few days of the infestation looking rather zombielike themselves, decide to get everyone together and wait out the crisis in (surprise!) the pub.

Let's face it, folks, zombies are funny. Especially when used as a commentary on modern life. (And Shaun of the Dead is the most effective film in this vein since the similarly-named 1979 Romero film.) Imagine an episode of The Office where Gareth gets eaten combined with an episode of EastEnders where... well, okay, with no changes at all.

The humor starts off slow, and for the most part stays surprisingly subtle for this crowd (Shaun going to get his morning coffee, resembling a zombie more than the actual zombies do, is one of the film's high points). This is dry wit, rather than slapstick, but it never stops being funny. Which is why, when the film does end up getting serious, you're so very surprised at how much you care about these characters. Ultimately, this is what keeps Shaun of the Dead from being a perfect film; the first hour manages to avoid every zombie clich&eacute; extant, and while the last half-hour is still above-average in the originality department, they do bow to a few horror film conventions for the sake of drama (not that they don't leaven it with a couple of good jokes to ease the tension). Not that this makes it a bad movie by any means, it's just a little on the disappointing side to see something so blissfully original slip a notch.

Absolutely required viewing for fans of zombie movies. Mostly required viewing for fans of comedy (there are one or two scenes not for the squeamish, but any cautions to be made for the all-ages crowd are for language, not violence). Oh, it doesn't matter who you are, just see this film. **** ",1093219200,4,2625,4.6688311688311686

This movie had some, not a whole lot, but then there was this  unexpectedly super gory part towards the end that I was not expecting. It seemed to me to lose a lot of its funniness after that.

The best part is the first half. He is going through his day and so many people are so spaced out you can't really tell if the zombie epidemic has started or not. Then after it starts, he is so used to people being out of it, and the neighborhood's casual vandalism, that he walks by half a dozen or so zombies without noticing them.

2105253,5,B0002MJT0I,"Slacker Shaun lives a boring and repetitive existence. He wakes up, has a chat with his even-more-of-a-slacker flatmate Ed, goes to the local convenience store for a soda, and heads off to work. After work, he hangs out at his favorite pub, The Winchester. Shaun's girlfriend Liz is tired of the routine and finally dumps him. Shaun also has trouble with his mum, who remarried when Shaun was twelve. Shaun has never gotten on well with his step-dad, who is constantly badgering him. Meanwhile, the zombie apocalypse starts in the background. After the dumping, Shaun and Ed go to The Winchester to get drunk and commiserate over Shaun's losses. Back at the flat, Shaun writes himself a note before passing out. The next day, the same routine starts and Shaun doesn't realize people aren't acting the same. By the time he gets back from the store, he and Ed realize things are amiss. Shaun sees his note telling himself to get Liz back and go visit his mum. He realizes this is the opportunity to turn his life around by actually doing something. Anything.

The movie's simple premise allows for a lot of creativity in storytelling. The movie has a lot of visual repetitions and call backs that are funny and show changes in the characters and situations. Shaun winds up improvising a lot of his plan along the way with comic results. The movie also has enough drama in moments where it needs it (like when loved ones need to be killed) to feel well-rounded. Since it is a zombie film with overtones of George Romero, the gore is strongly R-rated. The movie also has a very British feel to it, with pragmatism and propriety clashing in interesting and comical ways. The mash-up of romantic comedy and zombie horror works surprisingly well.

Highly recommended, as long as you can stand some serious gore.

Quite a bother to have a favored classic become so, well, amateurish.  Mostly it was the writing and the emotional lack of control of all the characters -- that's over the top to me now.  Future me -- don't watch this until at least 2020.  Or maybe never again.  Yeah, it was that disappointing.  Thankfully, there's so many reviews here -- no one will be tripping over this one, but if you're reading this,and you feel like you've seen the film too many times but maybe it can be good for one more viewing, don't watch it until you can hardly remember it.",1488240000,,839,4.608108108108108

2105298,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead(released Mar/04)stars,among others,Simon Pegg and  Nick Frost. This is the first with the dynamic duo that really hit home with everyone and became a sensation.
The story finds Pegg in a dead end job with Frost unemployed and living with him and a paying border. Frost of course is the sloppy one and does nothing but play video games during the day and drink(on Peggs dime)at the local at night,while his paying boarder fumes. We watch Pegg in his daily routine from getting up, to going to work,to drinking at the pub and starting all over. One constant element is that Peggs girlfriend wants a better relationship with him that he isn't prepared to start. One day things are different and Pegg doesn't realize it. Zombies are suddenly making their presence known. Before Pegg gets a handle on it all it has turned into a Zombie poop storm. Pegg and Frost gather up his girlfriend,his girlfriends friends,his mother and step dad and head for their local. For a while it is ok but eventually they must abandon it as all but Pegg and his girlfriend are left. Just outside the Army arrives and blasts the Zs away an rescues the two. The film ends as six months later the outbreak has gone and Pegg and his girlfriend are living happily ever after. The left over Zs are used for entertainment purposes and Zombie Frost is now out in Peggs shed as he joins him for a round of video gaming.
Edgar Wright(the director and Peggs co-writer)helms this one well. The two build their Z predicament slowly but steadily. It is chock full of the usual nonsense we have now come to associate with Pegg films,such as his characters under blown reactions to ever escalating events that should really have him concerned. His final touch of having a Zombie Frost in the shed was brilliant.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes and outtakes,commentary and casting tapes.
All in all a cut above and an original take on the Zombie movie dearth out there. If you are a Pegg fan this one is definitely for you. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1484611200,,2095,4.601604278074866

Anyways it was not even worth to rent it might be a good free movie but to spend money on this no thanks wish I could have gotten my money back.

2105649,5,B0002MJT0I,"This is the first installment of the ""Cornetto trilogy"", a loose collection of three films (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The Worlds End) directed by Edgar wright, written by Simon Pegg, and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (a comedy troupe quite similar to the American ""Broken Lizard"")

The first two films are available in this comic book style steelbook bluray/hd dvd format while the third (for whatever bizarre reason) is not (though you can get it in steelbook just not the comic style which matches the first two. It should also be noted that you can get the film ""Paul"" in the comic style format. Though directed by Greg Mottola (not Edgar Wright) and thus not technically part of the Cornetto Trilogy, it is still written by Simon Pegg (and Nick Frost as well) ).

While all three are funny movies in their own right (and I'm a big fan of the whole lot), many consider this title to be the best of the three. I'm not sure if I agree myself, though I will say that both this and Hot Fuzz are certainly better than World's End (though that is not at all a bad film)",1432166400,,1074,4.391959798994975

2105678,4,B0002MJT0I,"Meant to see this years back, was for some reason a bit suspicious that it was gonna
be any good or funny, perhaps because I wasn't really aware of the talents of Simon Pegg and crew at the time,
in any case, I screened this after watching The World's End this past week, which was pretty good,
and I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead to a certain point (being a massive horror and George A. Romero/zombie
movie fan from ages ago), although neither film knocked me out to the point of giving them 5 stars.

Both have some serious and grave moments/elements that aren't funny whatsoever, although on the other
hand, at least these films aren't all fluff and silliness and balance out with some gravitas, sometimes this works,
sometimes it stops things in their tracks (such as Shaun's mom dying and becoming a zombie in this film
and that whole awful scene in the pub).  I think the problem with most horror/comedy films (going back to
things like Love At First Bite although excepting great ones like Young Frankenstein) is they cannot decide
if they want to be serious on the horror side and how much comedy to balance it all out with.  These two films
thus far seem to me to have some of those issues, although they both deliver a good deal of laughs
and particularly if you enjoy sharp British comedy in any case.  On the other other hand, if you are a Romero
fan in particular that's followed his career from the beginning than this movie, at least, is true to his ""school""
insofar as it retains Romero's balance of realistic ""seriousness"", gore, and the darkest possible gallows
humor, as displayed in Night of the Living Dead and Dawn and all subsequent films, and to a lesser degree
in his truly disturbing ""vampire"" film MARTIN (which I've written an entry on myself for a Vampire Encyclopedia
from Greenwood Press a few years back).  There's violence here but it's mainly soft-pedalled like Pegg and his
buddy chucking new wave 12"" records at the zombies hoping to hit 'em in the head, (New Order has little
effect), or trying to dispatch them with cricket bats and such.

I just can't declare these two films I've seen thus far to be major comedic masterpieces, but I did enjoy
watching both of them and being a fan of the Horror/SF genres for decades I think this is really the primary
audience Pegg and his gang have in mind, and that's fine.  If you're a dedicated Horror/Fantasy fan
you'll probably appreciate these two films of this ""trilogy"" (Hot Fuzz apparently is not SF or Horror at all)
a lot more than most viewers.  Otherwise a lot of the humor and jokes may fall far flat, just as those
before or after a certain Gen. X generation may not ""get"" much of the goings-on in The World's End for
similar reasons.",1426896000,,2721,4.538775510204082

Simon Pegg and Nick Frost yet again team up to play close mateys who create an onscreen chemistry that will have you howling with laughter. The cinematography is unique and the dialogue is clever and witty, which often hits close to home and can be related to one's own (perhaps perceivedly mundane...but sans zombies...I hope) life circumstances, which makes it all the more hilarious and engaging.

Also, if you look closely, you'll notice a few familiar faces from the uniquely funny TV show ""Spaced"" and the romping movie ""Hot Fuzz,"" as well as additional cameos from actors Bill Nighy and Martin Freeman. You will come away with a healthy helping of delicious movie quotes to drum up laughter at your beckoned call. It provides quite the extravaganza, actually.

Why make a steelbook if you're not going to go all the way and include a booklet at the very least?  All that's included is a cheap piece of paper advertising The World's End.

My other gripe about this is the plastic part that holds the actual disc.  The plastic is hard and the release button that holds the disc in place is designed incredibly poorly.

2105748,5,B0002MJT0I,"It is THAT much of a treasure.

Aside from thoroughly enjoying the dark comedic masterpiece simply on its own merits, one of my concerns has always been WTSHTF, what if I'm not quite fit enough to withstand the onslaught- or worse yet, happen to find myself in the unlucky circumstance to wind up in the company of some of my 'frenemies'? Shaun of the Dead always reminds me that quite likely, my fitness level (or lack thereof...) may actually work to my advantage in terms of narrowing down my survival choices to only the ones I am actually capable of performing. Also, the issue of an eternity lived with my 'frenemies' will not be a thorn in my side for long as I will be able to slice them in the head with a shovel or filet their cranium with an old LP flung like a ninja star without residual remorse or (more importantly) interrupting the plot line of my own survival

Also, (as i learned upon my latest viewing) this is a GREAT movie to watch with the family after Thanksgiving dinner. Sure, not everyone 'gets it', but that really does add a layer of enjoyment you just don't experience when sharing your viewing with like-minded friends.

Wish I could give it six stars- and a 'thumbs up'!",1417219200,,1201,4.474885844748859

2105771,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead certainly satisfies the zombie qualifications.  It features old school zombies doing exactly what you would expect.  They're slow, lumbering, not particularly bright, and there are a lot of them.  Soon it's down to survival of the dimmest as a group of nitwits hold up in an indefensible bar for the expected last stand.  Shaun of Dead is a hodgepodge of humor and horror featuring relationship woes that immediately clash with the need to stay alive.

I liked this movie but it felt like it took forever to get to the good part (the zombies).  Instead of supporting the essential action inherent in a zombie flick, the plot took a long circuitous route that first wallowed in a lot of drudge concerning the main character's clumsy attempt at romance.  The specific humor involved in this plot devise was hammered home relentlessly throughout the movie as though the screenwriters had absolutely no confidence in the audience getting the one and only joke they presented at the outset.

The best part of this movie was the frantic attempt to gather loved ones (essential and nonessential) to ensure everyone's safety while battling the marauding horde of hungry zombies.  That was funny, the rest not so much.",1414627200,,1227,4.91747572815534

Their brand of British off-beat humor puts the whole zombie madness craze in the rightfully, irreverent perspective.  The zombies are convincing, the jokes are funny and the actors and characters, even in spite of the outlandish situation, are ones you grow to like and actually care about, right up to the surprise ending which shows true friendship never dies.

2105814,4,B0002MJT0I,"SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a smart, funny homage to zombie movies while also maintaining its own identity instead of relying entirely on genre cliches. This film marked the first theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright and is a mostly solid affair. The performances and directing are all handled well, but it wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as I was expecting. Maybe it's because British humor isn't something I 100% get. Still, I thought that the gore was well-done, tension was kept up and the characters were all likable enough that I cared what happened to them. For me, the best moments were the quieter situational humor rather than the gory kills that one would expect from such a horror-comedy. Overall, it's one of the better horror-comedies to come out in the last 10 years and should provide enough thrills and laughs for genre fans.",1407974400,2,879,4.906040268456376

Sadly, the United States cannot lay claim regardless of how many of their movie tickets we have bought.

Shaun of the Dead is to zombies what Paul was to aliens.  Shaun (Pegg) and his roomie Ed (Frost) are ne'er-do-wells on autopilot through life until Shaun's girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) kicks him to the curb.  Shaun and Ed go on a rip tearing bender that turns out to be the Zombie Apocalypse.  There they earn their stripes.

Things do get remembered differently when they've had a few years to settle, but i enjoyed the situation humor, the sight gags, and the fact that most people would be just like this if it happened to them.  I see people all the time so immersed in their phones that they never look up, so you can imagine what they would think if they looked up to confront a zombie! I would not share it with someone much younger than 8 or 9.  Not a lot of nudity or foul language, but the special effects were explicit in some places.",1402876800,,652,4.158730158730159

Therefore, when I found out it had been released as part of the Universal ""Reel Heroes"" Comic-themed Steelbooks I was ectastic!!! It comes in a bluray/DVD/digital copy combo pack, in a limited edition steelbook case, and features comic rendered art from the movie. The packaging alone is enough to throw down the money, but the fact is that this special edition Shaun of the Dead is just as reasonably priced as its plastic-cased counterpart is.

Universal tends to pack these steelbook releases with plenty of special features and Shaun of the Dead is no exception. I personally have not watched them so while there are plenty of special features I cannot comment as to the quality and length of them.",1399593600,,845,4.671140939597316

I Do Not Like The Zombie/Horror Genre At All,THAT BEING SAID, I'm Not Against It As Long As It Is Done I A Way That Is Good

And was Shaun Of The Dead good? Yes It Was

There was so much about this movie that I enjoyed; mainly the comedy, but still, other little things as well (but mostly the comedy)

The cast was a lot of fun, and usually when the pack is headed by Simon Pegg, the movie will at least be worth watching, but this movie is defiantly one his best, and one of the only relevant and non-crapfest zombie flicks that has ever been released. And to be honest, the only other zombie thing that i've ever enjoyed is ""Warm Bodies"" and that's pretty much it (The Last Of Us doesn't count considering the fact that those are not zombies, but zombie-like people; just saying, technically not zombies).

So, we got to the bottom line pretty fast, but it's a zombie movie, what'd you expect, but still, I hold to my opinion;
71%- Taking a cricket bat to the cliches and a shovel to what was becoming a boring and repetitive genre, Simon Pegg takes charge in this hilarious zombie apocalypse tale, and gives us one of the best zombie movies ever made.",1397952000,,1175,4.327272727272727

I still like ""Fawlty Towers"" and Monty Python stuff, which is better written and lacks the soupy sentimental undertow of this one.  The best moments here are the ones when the characters forget the sticky situations that they're in and start rehashing their old relationship issues.  There's a touch of the Python is such moments that are welcome.  When our heartstrings are tugged -- as when Shaun has to shoot his (already dead) mother -- it's really a bit cringe-inducing.  Shaun's stepfather (also zombie-ized) is played by Bill Nighy.  Why?  Shaun and his friend Ed have the slacker buddy stuff down -- but slacker movies are almost by definition not good.

2105912,4,B0002MJT0I,"I liked this British dark comedy, very appropriately undertitled ""Romantic comedy with zombies"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) is an electronics store employee, whose prospects for a successful life and/or career were mostly ruined since like always by Ed (Nick Frost), a slob and a slacker allergic to work, who enjoys the most being gross, vulgar and insult people. Ed basically lives on Shaun's coach and subsists on Shaun's hand-outs.

As if Ed was not enough of a problem, Shaun is also considered as a big disappointment by his mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and especially by his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He is also disliked by his stepfather Phillip (Bill Nighy), totally disrespected by his younger work colleagues and is in conflict with his housemate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). His one joy and consolation in life is his favourite pub, the Winchester, where he and Ed spend every evening.

And then one day, a zombie invasion begins

This is a quite honest comedy, with some pretty good jokes, not the least of which is the fact that initially Shaun and Ed (not being very bright) are completely oblivious to the undead threat and the apocalypse that just began))) Once they really realise what is happening (it is then almost the middle of the film), well, for a time jokes decline a little bit in quality, but things get better again towards the end. I particularly appreciated the final scenes, in which we discover that zombies, once appropriately trained, can be actually used as cheap labour or partners in some entertainment activities)))

Other than the weaker jokes in the middle of the film I had also a little problem with Ed, whose character was for my taste a little bit overdone  this guy is so repulsively gross and foul that it was actually difficult to watch him by moments

But still, this is a very honest, mostly funny comedy, which parodies very nicely zombie flicks and other disaster movies. Enjoy!",1391472000,,1990,4.922388059701492

In some of the zombie scenes the camera cuts away from the zombies as they are walking for a bit and then when it again focuses on the zombies they are still walking in the same place, If these issues of time don't bother you, then it will be a great movie!",1371772800,,356,4.028169014084507

This movie takes the scary theme of zombies and makes it funny.  There are so many laugh out loud moments!  I love the actors and their acting abilities in this movie.  They are all perfect for their roles.  My son has either lost or broken/scratched several copies of this movie over the years, and it is so good and he loves watching it so much that I always end up replacing it with a new copy.

Should have looked more closely at the description and reviews before buying. I should think that if you are a person who enjoyed Bob Hope and  Paulette Goddard in their comedy featuring a zombie when it first came out, you will not really get much out of this film. In other words, it ought to bear one of those age warnings, the equivalent of a rating that says a 17 year old  must be accompanied by an adult, which advises that an adult over the age of ?? cannot view this film without being accompanied by a younger person (who can point out what is humorous and why).",1370131200,,712,4.345864661654136

The writer has outdone himself in noticing that some people tend to walk similar to zombies, when we first awake. Also, some people who are wide awake also tend to walk similar to zombies. Although it does have a tendency to get too gory (a couple of scenes of zombies becoming impaled on a steel pole would make people with a delicate composition a bit too squeamish), the director doesn't shy away from making a fictional story seem incredibly real. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a funny movie on Halloween or any non-Halloween night.

Believable interpersonal tensions of everyday ordinary people experiencing a zombie epidemic.  Would give it 3 and a half stars.

All of the characters were really annoying and by the end I wanted all of them to get eaten by zombies. I love comedies, but I just didn't think this was very funny. Shaun and his slob roommate are so dumb that they are unaware the zombie apocalypse is going on until days after it starts when there is a zombie in their yard. How would you be able to miss that, even if you don't watch the news? This could have been more entertaining if the characters were people you could root for instead of irritating slackers with few redeeming qualities and no common sense.

Simon Pegg and his merry band of malcontents, misfits and ne'er do wells take the zombie genre and give it a wedgie, make it sit on a whoopee cushion, and add a wet willie to boot.

2106162,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is EASILY one of my top five favorite comedies.  If you like Simon Pegg, British humor, Spaced (Simon's previous tv series), and the associated ensemble of actors, you'll love Shaun of the Dead.  The director has a unique plot style, camera cut-away usage, and other distinct aspects that were perfected during the filming of the tv series Spaced. MUST WATCH!",1351468800,,377,4.875
2106163,3,B0002MJT0I,"Edgar Wright's cult classic Shaun of the Dead follows the titular Shaun (Simon Pegg), a nice salesman who feels as though his life is going nowhere. His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is disappointed in his lack of ambition. Shaun's best friend Ed (Nick Frost) epitomizes this arrested development. Ed's simian humor (he literally imitates gorillas) amuses Shaun to no end, but leaves their other roommate, Shaun's girlfriend, and her judgmental roommates Diane and Dylan (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) cold.

In the midst of his personal problems, Shaun finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Is this his chance to find his inner strength and get his life together? That is, if he survives?

This comedy has amusing and surreal moments of silliness and satire, but its humor isn't for everyone. For those whose funny bone it doesn't strike, the film's strength comes from its metaphors. Shaun feels stuck in his routines, held back and a little dead inside--not unlike a zombie. In fact, the drones populating the city of London already resemble the living dead. Shaun is so oblivious to his fellow humans and the world around him, he hardly realizes an epidemic is upon them.

Our hero's journey from overlooked ""loser"" to courageous leader is also satisfying. He finds himself torn between the well-intended but prepubescent friend of his youth and his girlfriend's affections. This is as much a relationship film as it is a horror movie.

There are some bloody moments, though. Horror and horror-spoof fans will enjoy watching the nonplussed Shaun and his best mate battle zombies. Others might find the film diverting but not particularly memorable. Many might connect to a man in his thirties who is trying to find himself--zombie infestation or no.",1351296000,2,1766,5.058419243986254
2106164,1,B0002MJT0I,"Ok, so I read reviews praising the movie and saw it on a lot of top 10 zombie movies lists.  Being a zombie fanatic, I tried to watch this, with tried as the key word.  Its not a real zombie movie, it is a satire.  AND, the comedy is weak, and not funny.  There were 2 or 3 laughs, but thats it.  This should by no means be on the same list as the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, or 28 days/weeks later films.  Or any REAL zombie movie for that matter.  This Shaun of the dead makes me shake my head and wonder what these critics were thinking, I still do not understand how this is a good movie by any means.  I've seen movies less dumb than this get canned, panned and rideculed, yet, Shaun of the dead gets highly praised by critics and fans alike.  Its not even a funny comedy for stupid comedy films.  I'm a huge fan of comedies that everyone considers stupid and dumb.  This is nothing like those, its just awful.  Did they watch the same movie??  This is the biggest flop IMO in the history of zombie movies.  If you want to see a real zombie movie, do not see this one.",1351123200,2,1078,4.023584905660377
2106175,3,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is a interesting twist in the zombie movie genre.  It stars Simon Pegg, who is easy to cheer for as Shaun, a mild mannered chap in his late twenties who is at a crossroads with his job, girlfriend, and mom and stepdad.  The along come the zombies.  This is a buddy film, with a romantic twist.  There is some vulgarity and pervasive violence, so this is not suitable for children under the age of sixteen.

Overall, the movie moves a little slowly at points, but there is a good bit of dry humor and, again, Shaun is a protagonist that I ended up liking more than I disliked.",1349481600,,593,4.258928571428571

2106177,5,B0002MJT0I,"The dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost can often at times be annoying, but when they are on they are really funny, and in this movie they're really funny.  The world or as it's known in the movie -- London (well, people who live in London do think the entire world consists of only London) -- is overtaken by a virus that turns people into zombies, and because God has a terrible sense of humor he decides that two people who aren't going to be turned into zombies are a store supervisor who lives his live as though he were half a zombie (Simon Pegg) and his out-of-work buddy who lives his life as a doped-up video game zombie.  In the first half of the movie it takes a while for our two heroes to realize that people around them are turning into zombies because they're so busy screwing up their lives during the day and hanging out at the Winchester Pub in the evening.  When they finally realize that the world is now trying to eat them they decide the safest place to go is the Winchester Pub where they plan to down some Guinness while the world somehow sorts itself out.

This is a movie that can be at times really funny and clever, and because it's a movie starring Simon Pegg it can at times be extremely annoying.  This is a movie that despite Simon Pegg and Nick Frost holds itself together, and it's an entertaining watch.",1348272000,,1343,4.313492063492063

I agree with the reviewers this is a love movie with horror parts in the form of zombies.  Mutiple scenes I was busting a gut from laughing so hard.  The main actor is a very good comedical actor but I didn't care for hot fuzz that much I perfer this one Shawn of the Dead.  As you watch it you can't help but root for him as he tries to save his girlfriend and friends from the zombies.

2106190,5,B0002MJT0I,"When the zombie apocalypse arrives, a hero will rise... from his sofa. When a horror maven as exalted as George Romero goes gaga over this film, even the most die-hard skeptic must recognize SHAUN OF THE DEAD for the wildly entertaining jolt of British cinema that it is. SHAUN OF THE DEAD isn't really a trend-setter. It may have opened the door for ZOMBIELAND, but there already were spoofy zombie flicks floating around before SHAUN OF THE DEAD (BRAINDEAD or the EVIL DEAD films, anyone?). SHAUN OF THE DEAD was brilliant and refreshing enough that it massively raised the profiles of several of the participants, namely Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their constant director Edgar Wright. This tea-swilling triumvirate rarely, if ever, disappoints.

At its heart SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a romantic comedy. The narrative revolves around a fidgety love story between slacker Shaun (Pegg) and his fed-up girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Except it's a love story that frequently gets undercut not only by the walking dead but also by Shaun's unflagging bromance with his even bigger loser and lived-in best friend Ed (Frost). Shaun, a sad sack sales advisor at some department store, has habitually let everyone down (except, I guess, Ed). He neglects his mum. He persistently breaks promises made to his girlfriend. You cannot blame her for dumping him. Which then leads us to Shaun's short term to-do list: go visit mum (bring flowers); win back Liz; sort out life; bash in ravening undead (don't forget flowers for mum).

It's a smart, gleeful, and absolutely inspired send-up of zombie horror, and at the end of the day I was surprised by how much heart it had. I think highly enough of SHAUN OF THE DEAD that, off the top of my head, I'm coming up with only four other zombie films to rank above it: Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD and Raimi's EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS. Director Edgar Wright masterfully marries the gory, ghoulish scares with the clever and genuinely funny bits. This is one of those times in which the kinetic quick edits amplify the tension. There are frequent legitimately spooky moments that'll make you jump. Still, it's the goofy sequences that plant themselves in your memory, whether it's the record-hurling sequence or the survivors' pretend zombie walk or any of those moments early on in which Shaun is just oblivious of all those ominous signs that indicate an impending zombie uprising. There are heaps of amusing foreshadowing. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is simply so well made, so well structured and terrifically paced. Pegg and Frost are perfection, with Pegg readily building on his lead actor creds. There is surprising weight and credibility to Simon Pegg. It's a star-making role. And what of their constant director Edgar Wright? Well, I am now hugely anticipating the ANT-MAN movie. That's how much stock I place in that reedy-voiced guy.

It's now our own running joke whenever we talk about zombie movies, bad movies, good movies, or the name Shaun. Or British English. Some things get lost in the translation, those were pretty heavy accents for us to decipher. Probably everyone can relate to the family or dating relationships going on, so get to laugh at themselves. There was also more swearing than I felt necessary, but I've never been in a zombie apocalypse so I can't honestly say how much swearing is enough.

2106199,5,B0002MJT0I,"I had heard from friends that this was a great movie, but after watching another so called ""good"" funny zombie movie last week that disappointed me (Zombieland) I was really hesitant. I have become such a ""Walking Dead"" fan with all the drama and action I was not sure I wanted the spoof in the mix, but please, folks, this is a good zombie flick. In the first part of the movie, even before people are zombies it is easy to see that most of us go through life in an unemotional zombified haze. Everyone on the bus, in the store, is half asleep or daydreaming with heads bobbing and vacant stares. This movie has the same feel and vibe as Jack Black and his roommate in ""School of Rock"". The stars are easily distracted by the everyday issues of life and have to come up with on the spot plans to change certain disasters. This has an impact on each person's ability to fight the zombie hoards. Along the way Shaun loses family and friends and deals with it as only a regular guy could. He is an every man super hero except his costume is a nerdy saleman's white shirt and tie. He grieves the loss of family and friends as he tries to  guide the rest to safety. His actions are ones  a regular person would consider and it creates the potential for all of us to see the sometimes silly and petty actions that govern our day-to-day lives to make it seem as if each day were indeed a crisis. In the end he makes a decision about how his life will end or continue and it quite likely the same that any one of us who is not a regular super action hero would take. Enjoy! I was very pleasantly surprised. It has the British humor of movie classics like ""The Full Monty"" and the real zombie gore one would expect of ""The Walking Dead"".",1336089600,,1729,4.236363636363636
2106200,2,B0002MJT0I,Funny movie. Good 5.1 effects. The HD isn't very high def. Can't compare with newer HD movies. Good for the price though.,1334793600,,121,4.545454545454546

Shaun, who has already been increasingly dissatisfied with his aimless life, rises to the occasion and sets off to rescue his ex-girlfriend (Kate Ashfield) and mother (Penelope Wilton), dragging Ed along for the ride.

I enjoyed the film, due to wonderful performances and the funny way that hell on earth so slowly impinges on Shaun's existence.  However, I have to admit that it fell short of my expectations, given the acclaim it has received over the years.  I was bothered by several scenes in which characters have extended, pointless conversations with each other while in the midst of an attack, but I was won back by the fresh take on a familiar genre and sharp social commentary.",1334620800,,839,4.887323943661972

2106203,5,B0002MJT0I,"I can't believe that I waited this long before watching Shaun of the Dead. It is one of those pitch-perfect movies that heads straight for the limits of insanity, absurdity, and drama --with such momentum and fervor that you think there's no way to stop before it gets maudlin or nonsensical; but Shaun of the Dead, skids just short of edge. I was especially impressed by how the rising threat evolves from something that can't be distinguished from the ordinary to the all out bloodbath and back again. Very intelligent and very funny, with a little heartfelt drama thrown in as a kind of garnish. I highly recommend this movie, as long as you aren't too squeamish. It's nowhere near as grisly as True Blood or The Walking Dead, but there's plenty of splattered 'red' throughout the film.",1332892800,,789,4.72463768115942

When the zombie apocolypse comes, clueless Shaun and his loser buddy must try to save Shaun's mother and ex-girlfriend with an ill-concieved plot to wait it all out at the local pub. Hillarity ensues. There is interesting social commentary as well. One word of advice: it is British comedy, and as such may not appeal to everyone.

When the city becomes infested with zombies, it is hard to tell the difference between the undead and the inebriated.

  This is the best kind of zombie movie of all.  It's a zombie movie that makes you think about life and the ways in which we all have a little bit of zombie within us.  We learn that there isn't an "" 'I' in team"" as Shaun and his friends band together to outsmart evil.

2106215,5,B0002MJT0I,"I love zombie movies. I'm not proud of it, but it's a fact. The gritty survival, the black humor, the gory deaths...what's not to love?

And among zombie movies, 'Shaun of the Dead' stands out from the shambling, rotting crowd.

It's funny, it's got characters that you can identify with, it's funny, it's cleverly written, it's funny, it's scary, it's funny, it has surprising depth...and did I mention that it's funny?

'Shaun of the Dead' does a neat trick - it follows the conventions and tropes of the zombie movie almost perfectly, at the same time as it parodies those conventions. It's a movie in nearly pitch-perfect balance of comedy and drama, never taking itself too seriously, but never going off the deep end for laughs. It can scare you, it can make you laugh, it can gross you out, and it can make you care about the people in it.

The titular Shaun is one of those people, a very average person having a bad day, who is completely shocked to find himself in the middle of the zombie (don't use the zed-word!) apocalypse in suburban London. His girlfriend has dumped him and his mother is married to a man who he can't connect with and his friend Ed doesn't bring much to the table other than a pretty good impression of a movie orangutan. In other words, Shaun is in every way an ordinary person who is thrust into an extraordinary situation when the dead begin to rise.

This is where the clever parts come in. The advent of the undead (which the audience knows is coming, of course) is done with great subtlety and worked into Shaun's story well. The fact that he barely notices as the evidence of the creeping horde mounts just adds to both the scares and the laughs. Several running jokes, physical comedy, and lots of funny side trips await as the story progresses.

The point is that zombie movies, for many like me, are something of a guilty pleasure. 'Shaun of the Dead' is that rare one, though, a zombie movie so smartly-made that you don't have to hide it. 'Shaun of the Dead' is one you can take home to your girlfriend and watch together.",1320105600,2,2068,4.516042780748663
2106216,5,B0002MJT0I,What can I say this movie is funny from beginning to end! Between this and Hot Fuzz I can't get enough of these guys!,1319846400,,117,3.9166666666666665
2106217,3,B0002MJT0I,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is the story of Shaun (Simon Pegg - ""Hot Fuzz), an under achiever who is constantly harped on from his girlfriend , from everything to not quitting smoking, to not drinking red wine instead of beer, LOL! His step father sees him as a going no where fast person, & one of his roommates calls him a ""loser."" So when a plague of the walking dead breaks out, this is Shaun's chance to prove he is not a quitter or loser, but a leader that will save the day, or at least, a few family members & close friends.

""Shaun of the Dead"" is influenced by many films, comedy & horror. It tries to be a ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock"" & ""Two Smoking Barrels"" of the Zombie sub-genre, but falls short of those films. It obviously takes cues from ""Return of the Living Dead"" & ""Dead Alive,"" but falls short of those films too, or for that matter, falls short of the brilliant comedic take on Zombies in ""Fido,"" 2006, which is a later film, but much more entertaining , as is ""Dog House,"" which is a much more comedic take on the Zombie sub-genre. That is not to say ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a bad movie by any means, just not a GREAT movie. But it is a movie that is highly entertaining, with some genuine belly laughs & a few genuine sad, somber moments. It is a film that I would highly recommend to the Zombie lover or comedy/horror fan,  just don't expect to many groundbreaking moments, no pun intended.

It wasn't nearly as funny as it needed to be, and I would say it was much more graphic than it needed to be.

This is the movie that got me switched on to the whole Simon Pegg and Nick Frost combo (having never seen the so much talked about Spaced). I have to admit that I bought the DVD because I was feeling a bit nostalgic.

This movie is a comedy / horror movie (weird combo) but trust me it does work... I find the comedy style in most Simon Pegg movies to be refreshing and somewhat subtle when compared to the in your face slapstick Hollywood comedic styles. Come to think of it there is a bit carried over from this movie to the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000RJO578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)</a>.. the morning sequence (where Shaun gets up in the morning and goes through his daily rituals in fast sequence of shots) and Ed's `Yeah Boooyyyyyyy!' Not that it takes anything away from either of the two movies. I tend to find Hot Fuzz funnier than this one, but this is still a funny movie.

I have to agree with the other reviews when they say that there scenes with quite a bit of realistic gore in them that might make people cringe. Also, there is slight amount of profanity in the movie... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem as the kids will not be around to watch this one for sure!

It's everything a good zombie movie should be - it's hilarious, snarky, a wee-bit scary, a wee-bit dramatic, and it has well-done zombie make-up and blood/gore... it even makes for a good date movie, because of the how-to-be-a-good-boyfriend factor!  ;-)

We see the main character start out as a lumbering, brainless (quite zombie-like, in fact), average-guy oaf who forgets his girl's flowers, doesn't really dedicate himself to doing all the things a good boyfriend should do for his significant other. But, by the end of the movie, he's learned his lesson.

See? A great movie all around. What more could you want?",1300665600,,715,4.844262295081967

2106237,4,B0002MJT0I,"'Shaun of the Dead' is a funny spoof Zombie movie that will have you chuckling out loud at times and with a few huge belly laughs chucked in for good measure. Simon Pegg is great to watch, as is Nick Frost, and the supporting cast are pretty good as well. This DVD is packed with extras and bonus material, which for the often good price you can snap this up for, makes for great value for money. The ending is a touch abrupt and the storyline is a bit thin, but for a 90 minute zombie comedy film you can't expect too much. It's a great little film, that doesn't take itself too seriously and is good for some light hearted entertainment. Give it a go.

2106243,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is one of the most unique horror films I've ever had the privilege of watching. One moment you're laughing, the next moment you get a scare! You might even find yourself shedding a tear or two in this over-the-top horror-comedy hybrid.

Meet Shaun (Simon Pegg), a man in his late 20's whose stuck in a bit of a rut. Like many of us Shaun is having a hard time finding his place in the world and spends his days working at a dead end job. His nights are spent at pub called the Winchester with his mates and girlfriend. Things go from bad to worse when Shaun forgets to make reservations for a special night with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Liz decides she's had enough of Shaun's irresponsibleness and dumps him. His relationship with his mum and step father isn't healthy either; and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse for poor old Shaun the zombie apocalypse begins! Together with his underachieving, video game playing flatmate Ed, Shaun has to figure out how to save his friends, salvage his relationship with his mum and get his girlfriend back.

If I had to use one word to describe Shaun of the Dead it would be ""fun"". This is a film that can be enjoyed by just about everyone. The dialog and acting are brilliant as are the make-up and special FX. The violence and gore is satisfying without being too over-done. The blu-ray disc is loaded with tons of fun extra content including four commentaries, extended scenes, deleted scenes, plot holes (a comic strip that fills you in on well... plot holes) and much more. Despite being released in 2004 Shaun of the Dead is already a horror classic that is not to be missed. For more, please check out [...]",1289692800,,1697,4.52442996742671

The one bad thing is the usage of the ""F"" word. I mean Wow! It's as if the writer of the movie was granted a wish by a Genie for every time he put the ""F"" word in the script. There was one scene where I had to mute it and wait for the scene to end before turning the sound back on. I would give this movie five stars.

2106247,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is a comedy classic in my book.  It justifies the zombie genre while also balancing reality and comedy spectacularly.  Edgar Wright is a fantastic director that was underappreciated for Scott Pilgrim.  All of his films deserve to be owned, watched, and enjoyed.

I have nothing bad to say about the film itself, however the last 20 minutes of it feels a little rough.  What I do criticize is its blu-ray release.  U-control is the most annoying feature I have seen in my dvd/blu-ray collecting career.  Nobody wants to watch this film 7 times to receive all the special features.  Put them in block segments and featurettes, instead of creating little pop-ups that play during the movie non-simultaneously.  Not only did Universal fail me in this disc, but Pegg and Wright did as well.  It was an annoying joke to put 3 commentaries on this release.  If you like to watch all the special features to get the most out of your money, Shaun of the Dead will be a big time-waster.  I liked the first commentary, but the remaining two were unnecessary.  Treat your films seriously and provide fans with a blu-ray that enjoyable.  I felt like Edgar Wright provided three commentaries to annoy the blu-ray collectors purposefully.

I summed it up before: Great Movie, Tedious Blu-ray.  That's all you need to know if you're going to upgrade to hi-def.  The picture and sound is great, but the features are a drag.  So, if you're only purchasing this disc to watch this excellent film, then for you this is a five star blu-ray release.",1288310400,2,1545,4.701492537313433
2106248,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun and Ed are inseparable best friends that share the same hobbies: playing video games, listening to electro, and frequently drinking at the Winchester Tavern. Shaun's girlfriend Liz is tired of being held back by Shaun and his slacker ways, so she breaks up with him. When he wakes up after trying to drink his sorrow away, he finds the world populated with the walking dead. After resolving to turn his life around, Shaun takes advantage of the apocalypse to take charge and win Liz back. Armed with a cricket bat and a shovel, he and Ed round up their friends and Shaun's parents and seek shelter at the only safe, secure place they know: the Winchester. With everyone depending in Shaun, will he prove to be a hero or just a washed up loser?

Shaun of the Dead is the classic story of a slacker turning his life around and becoming a hero during the zombie apocalypse. It's one of my favorite movies of all time because of its perfect balance of horror and comedy with a little splash of romance. I never would have thought that these elements could work so well together, but Edgar Wright's masterpiece of a zombie film proved me wrong. The buildup to the zombie outbreak is simply perfect. It starts off as a typical romantic comedy with a look into a normal day in Shaun's life where no one respects him and he lets his girlfriend down time and time again. The next day, he goes through close to the same routine, except for the people he usually sees on his route to the nearby convenience store are all dead, zombies, or gone. One of the things that makes this film great is the repetition. From the first normal day to the apocalypse day, many of the same things are done and said, but mean wildly different things on the second day than on the first. For example, someone commenting ""You've got red on you"" the first day means a red pen exploded in your pocket, but the second day means your shirt is splattered with blood from bludgeoning zombies to death with a cricket bat. There are quite a few things like this (way too many to write about) that provide many laughs and are also a sign of great writing.

Simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as Ed are a hilarious comedic duo. Shaun is the meek, kind of quiet slacker who lets others push him around. On Z-day, he turns his entire life around and does all the things he has always wanted to do. Ed is the foul mouthed, obnoxious under achiever who makes pretty much everyone uncomfortable around him. He's still annoying and kind of a jerk on Z-day, but he really comes through for his best friend when it matters. They are definitely an unlikely duo to become leaders during the zombie apocalypse, but at the same time are realistic characters.

Their friendship is exhibited throughout the film, even when they are in the direst of situations. I know people who would go out of their way to kill zombies as if they were in a video game and pick a random location to hide out that might not work out as well as first thought. Although much of the film is funny, there are a few very emotional and touching scenes that brought me to tears. These moments show that the characters have dimensions deeper than their slacker facades. The ability for such a funny movie to succeed in having heartbreaking, tear inducing scenes is amazing and shows a culmination of writing, acting, and directing.

Many zombie films are used as an allegory for social commentary and this one is no different. The opening credits, surprisingly, is where this is most evident, but only on the second viewing. The scene shows many of the people who turn into zombies later in the movie going through their everyday routing: working at mindless, repetitive jobs and doing the same things day after day. Are these people really any different after they become zombies? It challenges the viewer to look at their own lives and judge if they are just good little mindless zombies themselves.

Shaun of the Dead has it all: zombies, humor, romance, loss, video games, and electro. Everyone could find something they like in this film, but it's required viewing for all zombie fans.",1287792000,,4118,4.566982408660352

Then in the second Return, well, that one was just dumb, and third Return was so idiotic we could barely watch it.  Shaun Of The Dead is smart and clever.

As it started, I was prepared to be disappointed. So meet Shaun a male air-head drifting thru a dull life. Totally asleep about things around hm. Shaun barely notices when those people around him start to ah ah change. Yeah, change. As the people around him become zombies, they (as you would expect) move much more slowly than normal people. The zombie disease is passed person to person by a bite (zombies like to bite). So with little purpose or plan, Shaun starts to collect the people in his life who are not infected and take them to a safe place; their corner bar.

A very British movie, a kinda odd and funny movie. It turned out to exceed my expectations enough that I'm giving it a 4 star rating. I do recommend this movie but not for young people; its kinda bloody.",1261094400,,921,4.41764705882353

Simon Pegg stars as average Joe Shaun, Nick Frost is his slacker friend, and Kate Ashfeild plays as Shaun's girlfriend. The film also stars Lucy Davis of The Office fame. Plus a small role by the great Bill Nighy! Its a Romantic comedy with zombies! Whats not to like?

2106266,5,B0002MJT0I,"What more can be said than the 450+ reviews here, which should tell you how popular/good this movie was.  It pays great homage and respect to the classic Zombie film(s) of Romero, down to the socio-culture symbolism, and puts a fresh twist on things by succeeding as a dark comedy.  It's one of those movies where you wonder why this hasn't been done already? Even if you are only casually familiar with the term Zombie or Zombie lore, this movie film puts Hollywood creations such as ""Scream"" to shame.  The British makers of this film know their Zombie lore and manage to tie-in logic, emotional empathy and relatability, that's believeable and endearing, often as a result of the light-hearted comedy and likeable protaganists.

*Spoiler Alert*

It was refreshing to see logical wrap ups with characters (why was Shaun's mom not more upset about her husband of 17 years dying and going Zombie? Well because she was bitten also and hid it from Shaun and everyone else until her end, and had already accepted her and her husband's fate, but wanted to appear normal for the survival of her son - yes! Brilliant!).

And of course the subtle but quite effective behavioral parallels that humans are living zombies in many ways, is perfect and blends right in with the dark humor and tone of the entire film.",1259625600,,1305,4.752212389380531

Consequently, I've seen the movie dozens of times now.

Rather than becoming tedious and repetitive, this movie actually gets better and better each time you watch it!  It's clear that enormous loving care went into the script, as there are dozens of instances of foreshadowing and inside jokes built into the scenery and dialog.  Minor characters turn out to be more deeply entwined with our heroes' lives than they appear at first.

2106281,5,B0002MJT0I,"If youve never been a fan of British comedy, this movie is excellent to ease you in. This is nothing like the Monty Python or the Are You Being Served? humor with which you may be familiar. Shaun of the Dead is American humor with a British accent. It is also a love story that happens to involve zombies.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) is riddled with guilt after his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) finally has enough of his juvenile ways and dumps him. Shauns friend and roommate Ed (Nick Frost) tries to console him at the local pub (the Winchester) where they spend all of their free time. Simultaneously, a zombie invasion is occurring. Shaun vows to win Liz back, but her two friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran) are trying to keep her away from Shaun with good intentions.

Shaun works a retail job, lives a lazy bachelors life and thinks an idea of a good time is going to the Winchester every night. It is understandable why Dianne and David would want better for Liz. Soon the gang realizes that their town that has been taken over by zombies, and Shaun understands that he needs to grow up and prioritize. If he needs to save the stepfather he despises, so be it. If he needs to kill his landlord who will soon turn into a zombie, so be it. He never liked him much anyway.

This film can be violent at times, but the humor certainly outweighs the gore. At one point, Ed and Shaun, having no weapons, resort to attacking oncoming zombies with their record collection. They cant just pick anything to throw, though  even in crisis one must decide if the Batman soundtrack is worthy of saving. In another scene, Shaun and Ed are leaving the Winchester while quite inebriated, singing a song with, unbeknownst to them, tonal accompaniment from the walking undead! The comedy in this film is certainly memorable. The squeamish may just want to cover their eyes at the nasty parts.

Shaun of the Dead was directed by Edgar Wright, the mastermind behind the British sitcom Spaced from which Simon Pegg and Nick Frost also originated along with Jessica Hynes, who makes a funny cameo in the film as the yin to Shauns yang. She is leading a team of friends in the fight against the zombies who happen to look and dress similarly to the party that Shaun is leading.

If you are easily bothered by horror films, you may be put off when thinking about picking up this movie. But rest assured, the zombies aren't all that scary and the brief shots of gore are few and far between so that you can turn away when necessary but still enjoy the movie. One of my closest friends has a phobia of zombies, and she was able to watch this film with little problem. (Although, she hasn't let us live down turning the lights off while we watched.)

If youd like to see any of Simon Peggs or Nick Frosts work, or if you want to enjoy a less dry brand of British humor, then this is a great place to start. If you have ever been fortunate enough to catch some episodes of Spaced, Shaun of the Dead follows a similar pattern. Edgar Wright is a superb director, and his style is a joy to watch unfold.",1249516800,,3089,4.4373897707231045
2106282,5,B0002MJT0I,"Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.

But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny ""Shaun of the Dead,"" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).

Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.

""Shaun"" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.

""Shaun of the Dead"" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (""Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet..."")

Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.

Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.

As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? ""Stone Roses?"" ""No."" ""...Second Coming?"" ""I liked it."" ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.

While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, ""Shaun of the Dead"" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, almost dead.",1248739200,,2956,4.713178294573644
2106283,5,B0002MJT0I,"You know the type of movie.  The main character is just moving along in life, happy, drinking beer, playing video games, and not cleaning up his place.  Suddenly BANG, there is an alien invasion, or his aunt dies, or he gets cancer and he has to examine his life.  Is he going anywhere?  Is he doing anything for the next generation?  Will anybody remember him if he falls down the stairs and breaks his neck?
That is this movie.  Shaun, a man who does not realize he is a failure is forced to face that fact after his girlfriend dumps him because he is not doing anything with his life.  The zombies are the factor that kicks him in the butt and forces him to become the Hero that nobody wanted him to be.
It is a movie about choices.  It is a movie about not listening to your girlfriend.  I mean, really, why does he have to cure cancer or save the planet from zombies?  Can't a person be happy just with three meals a day, a roof over the head, and some extra time and money to spend on themselves?  Why must we all become a Hero?  A General?  A President?  What's wrong with enjoying life?  What's wrong with staying in on the weekend and watching a movie or playing on the game station or having some root beer and pizza instead of going out?  Shaun wasn't a bad guy - he loved his girlfriend, tried to get along with his friends and, to my knowledge, didn't drown kittens.
Think about what you ask for, it may come true.  Well, in this case what the girlfriend asks for.  Great movie and teaches us a lesson about enjoying what we have and not trying to wish for change.  Change just hurts you in the end.  Don't trust it.",1248652800,2,1629,4.210355987055016

And it does a wonderful sendup of the genre. No cliche is left unmolested. You really do end up laughing at most of the scenes. Some of the humor is clever and most of it is ironic. Respect the R rating for what it represents and you'll probably have a good laugh.

Some may think it's cheater, but I enjoyed it, and will watch it more just to see if I can pick out more instances.  If you like zombie movies, you like this one, if you like satirical comedies, you'll like this one.  If you think Simon Peg is hot . . . well, you're strange, but he's there too.

Both of them hated it, and I loved it. Like the other reviewer said, it's intellectual humour. Amazing. I'm going to rent it without commercials and the hack job Comedy Central did on it and try it again.

This movie is very, very funny.  The writing is smart, and includes ""inside"" references to any number of horror/scifi movies.  The main character and his buddy are reminiscent of Earl and his brother, Randy, from ""My Name is Earl"", but this movie takes the time to occasionally get serious, especially towards the end.",1236211200,,530,4.988636363636363

The movie is more centered on Shaun winning back his girlfriend than surviving the undead plague rampaging the island.  There is a ""play within a play"" as the surviving group attempts their best zombie impersonations in order to ascertain safety in their local pub.

It doesn't matter what country you're from, or what language you speak. If you live in North America, western Europe, or Austrailia, you probably personally know a version of Shaun and each of his friends. I personally can't watch Shaun of the Dead without forgetting that there's a border between the US and Canada, an ocean between those two and the UK, and a planet between me and Austrailia/New Zealand. It has no politics, no preaching, and no culturally polarizing commentary. It's good-natured comedy, clever writing, and memorable acting. Because of these reasons, this is certainly in my own top 10 favorite movies of all time.",1209772800,,775,5.158730158730159
2106319,5,B0002MJT0I,"Where do I begin?  This movie has it all!  Clever dialogue, cool plot, lots of humor, touching emotional scenes, romance, and of course- ZOMBIES!!!!

Shaun is your average Joe working for a living, living in a flat with his two roomates, trying to keep his relationship with his girlfriend together, and visit his Mum every once in a while.  Oh- and make regular visits to the local pub.

His humdrum life is interrupted with a sudden surge of zombies in the neighborhood, and our average bloke must step up and become a hero.
What I really loved about this movie is that things were done that I have never seen in a zombie movie before- i.e. when Shaun and the gang figure a way to walk through a crowd of zombies without calling attention to themselves, and what becomes of the zombies when the story is over.

To really enjoy and appreciate the phenomena that is Shaun of the Dead, you should watch it 4 or 5 times, to truly grasp all of the nuances that you may miss because you are hiding behind your pillow or laughing too hard.

You really have to be aware of what's going on in the background, though, which makes this a great movie to watch more than once. In the scene where they leave the pub singing and call to the woman who appears to be dancing with a man, ""what's wrong love, haven't you had your tea yet?""she's actually gnawing on the man's neck, and when they turn around, you can see his head fall off...they, of course, are so drunk that they miss it.

2106321,5,B0002MJT0I,"This is my favorite movie. This movie really launched Simon Pegg's career.
Gory but totally funny. A great movie for all the brit comedy lovers.",1207440000,,144,4.8
2106322,5,B0002MJT0I,"Creating a formula picture is never a good idea - unless you have created a formula like Simong Pegg and Edgar Wright have done here.  Initially, ""Shaun of the Dead"" in title and in plot description, sounds like a mere parody of Romero's dead movies ala ""Scary Movie"" and such. But Wright and Pegg, in spoofing the genre, create an homage pic.  It's full of funny moments that tip their hit to Romero's 'Zed word' flicks, but it has so much original horror and humor to offer.

Namely, the premise is original.  While many horror pics looks at the heroic survivors of a horrific tragedy, ""Shaun"" looks at those other guys.  Unlike the inhuman heroism of typical horror pics, Shaun and his friend Ed are unapologetic slackers. In fact, Shaun's desire to save his friends may do more harm than good.  Wright and Pegg craft an interesting bunch of characters that are really those other guys in horror films.  They're funny and horribly flawed.  Shaun's plan to save everyone is interesting in its successes and failures, breaking the trend of so much recent horror.  In all its comedy, you'll still care about every character in the end.  In that, its successful in its own right as a horror film, as much as it is in comedy.

But it's the comedy that triumphs above all. The writing is razor sharp.  Listen to every piece of dialogue and you wil realize that Wright and Pegg have crafted an ingenious script that is constantly referencing itself as well as other horror movies.  Key to the writing though is the pitch perfect delivery.  This is something that Simon Pegg, in particular, has perfected.  His humor is rather dry, sometimes subtle.  Yet at the same time, he is also a brilliant physical comedian, as noted in this film's famous jukebox scene.

Pegg doesn't ride alone in his talent though.  He has quite a bit of support, namely in his partner in crime Nick Frost - who's humor is much more direct as the lovable oaf Ed, and Dylan Moran, who has achieved fame in his own right doing stand up and in Black Books.  While visibly more sober here, Moran is impecable as the uptight critical friend of Shaun's girlfriend.

But one sole review is not enough to express all the great things about 'Shaun of the Dead.'  You're best served by watching the film.  When you're done watch it again.  If you have time, watch it again and just listen to it to hear all the witty dialogue.  Then you can raid the extras.  This DVD is full of them.  While I love ""plot holes"" section, my favorite involves the making of the film.  This is far from standard 'making of' fare, as it traces ""Shaun"" from it's young origins.  Watch these guys at work - you'll realize more goes into this comedy than a simple script and a couple funny actors.

Just as a side note, for those curious, the Region 2 DVD differs in the fact that the UK trailers are included and that 3 (coun them: 3!) more commentaries are included.",1207267200,,2906,4.5346153846153845
2106323,5,B0002MJT0I,"At first I didn't like this movie and I thought it was stupid. For some reason it grew on me. Now I can't stop laughing everytime I watch it. This is one of those movies that you think is going to be a bomb but then laugh so much from the weirdness. There are laughs all over the place and it takes a good half hour for Shaun (Simon Pegg) to realize that he is surrounded by zombies. Him and a friend that he lives with cook up a plan to save his ex-girlfriend, his mom, and stepfather (although Shaun would rather leave him to the zombies). Shaun believes the best place to wait it out is at the local pub.

There weapons of choice are: cricket paddles, old records (Shaun goes through which ones to through which is hilarious), his stepfather's Jaguar, and a metal pipe.

Shaun of the Dead is very entertaining and is one of those movies that you'd think you would skip if it's in the movie theaters and on T.V. When you watch it, you get hooked. The comedy is great as it mocks Dawn of the Dead slightly and any other zombie movie you've watched. It's a good addition to your comedy collection.",1207094400,,1097,4.244019138755981

2106331,5,B0002MJT0I,"This movie is truly hilarious, sure to entertain and delight fans of horror, comedy, and horror/comedy. The acting is exceptional, especially Simon Pegg, who plays Shaun. The comedy is not really slapstick or in-your-face jokes but more of an understated type of humor, which is especially effective in this setting.

The plot revolves around Shaun, who when we meet him is dealing with the problem of juggling time between his girlfriend and his best friend, who is somehwat of a- well- loser. One thing this movie does very well is establish character, so that during the movie you really get to know and identify with them. Shaun is portrayed as a sort of Avergae Joe or everyman, who shuffles back and forth from his ""flat"" (as they say in England) to his menial job. The idea that a poor slob like Shaun would end up having to save the world from the undead is the basic premise, and irony, of the film. The funniest moments come when Shaun goes about the mundane tasks of his life, oblivious to the horror around him (people dropping over dead, bloodstains in the shop he enters, etc.) The movie is brilliantly written, and all of the actors do a wonderful job at making the humor work.

I would not call this a parody of horror movies, as there is some gore and violence; it works on many levels and cannot be easily pigeonholed. It sort of transcends a genre, which to me is a sign of a great movie.

One of the most originial, intelligently written, and best acted movies I have seen lately. You will not be disappointed in this.",1200355200,,1538,4.5451263537906135

The HD presentation of the film on this disc is just as good as, if not better than the disc for Hot Fuzz. The surround is very active, with the zombies growls coming from every direction during key scenes. Like Hot Fuzz, this film is pretty much an aural and visual assault on the senses.

Satirical and funny, scary and touching, this movie has it all (including a GREAT soundtrack!).  At first Shaun is too focused on his own problems to notice anything else around him - his girlfriend is dissatisfied with their relationship, because all they ever do is go to pub (the Winchester) in the evenings with their respective roommates, and they never do anything together.  Also, he is stuck in a dead-end job where, even when he is put into a position of authority when everyone else calls in, no one treats him with respect.  His mother is the type who refuses to see the bad around her, while his stepfather is just . . . creepy.

Using the slow take-over and Shaun's complete unawareness of it as a point of showing how little we tend to pay attention to the world around us, and doing so in a darkly humourous way was a definite hit.  Once Shaun realizes what is happening, he decides what to do and sets out to do it - basing his entire decision on making certain he gets his mother and his girlfriend to some type of safety and not really considering carefully before choosing the pub that perhaps the zombies could break the glass in the windows (of course, the zombies didn't need to, since whats-his-knob, that blue-nosed son-of-a-pumpkin, broke them first).

Since I had some trouble with my Mac scanning the DVD, I watched for a second time.  What jumped out at me was Shaun's manager's pep-talk about 'teams' and what a study of human nature Shaun and his group would make.  We saw thinking outside of the box, bravery in the least expected places, selflessness, and how utterly stupid the panicked group Critic could be.

Seriously, if the corporate trainers ever get tired of making their teams climb rock walls and build paper gizmos that nobody will ever use, they ought to have employees watch this film--twice--so they can see human nature in action.

All that can be said about it has been said by other reviewers. Having seen it countless times on standard DVD I was looking forward to the HD DVD. I have to say I was blown away. It really has the same extras as the standard DVD but the video quality is far superior. The sharpness and colors really pop for a low budget movie. To be honest there are a few dark scenes that have some grain but this is due to the films low budget origins. For $20 this HD-DVD is a must have for Shaun fans and is a fantastic upgrade. If you love dry British humor, this is for you.
I have shown this to as many people as I can and will continue to do so.

As my wife says, ""If we can bring Shaun of the Dead to one person, then we've done something good"".

So when it comes to the lurching, head-snacking undead, I tend to steer the other way.  Well, too many of my friends have commented on Shaun Of The Dead, so I had to take a look for myself.  I'm a big fan of dry British humor and Shaun Of The Dead is packed with that as well as flesh-scarfing zombies.  The entire scene where Shaun goes to the liquor store to by his morning drink and completely ignores all the signs (the bloody handprints on the glass of the cooler door, the dead bodies sprawled in the yards and streets) that the zombies have come to roost.  Hysterical!  Along with his slacker cohort Ed, Shaun decides to go over to his mum's house and rescue her, while taking care of his zombie-bitten step-father with a cricket bat.

It starts out with our hero (of sorts) drudging through his very ordinary, boring life. His ever trusty sidekick best friend is only more than happy to coast along with him as long as he doesn't have to do anything. After a forgetful snafu, he looses his girl. While all this is going on, he fails to realize the world around him is changing. For the rest of the movie he is trying to get to his favorite pub for refuge, battle zombies and his ex-girlfriend's acidic friends and get her back. The humor is nonstop and at times can be very subtle as with most British movies. If you want a good romantic comedy that won't put you to sleep, I highly recommend this movie.

2106371,5,B0002MJT0I,"Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.

But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny ""Shaun of the Dead,"" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).

Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.

""Shaun"" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.

""Shaun of the Dead"" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (""Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet..."")

Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.

Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.

As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? ""Stone Roses?"" ""No."" ""...Second Coming?"" ""I liked it."" ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.

First of we all know this is a spoof and is supposed to be funny. And it really is! But who knew there was going to be some serious depth to it.

The script had tons of foreshadowing. When you watch this movie the second time you start cracking up at the characters you see before they are zombies and the part they played. I have not seen such funny and creative foreshadowing in a movie ... period.

The romantic conflict was well done. Questions are raised about what a relationship is supposed to be like and the role others play in a relationship. It even had a great fight scene that I have to say resembles more than a few I have had in my lifetime.

The inner conflict as the main character becomes acutely aware of his life wasting away was almost inspiring... in a funny lazy sort of way.

The zombies were suitably creepy and had bits of fright amongst the laughs.

You care about the characters because of all the internal and relationship conflict and the roles are very well acted out. Amazingly well, acted out.

Simon Pegg stars as Shaun, an ordinary guy who works in an electrical goods store. On the day his girlfriend dumps him there is an outbreak of zombies and he has to save her and his friends including layabout Ed (played by Nick Frost). The cast is very good, as well as Simon Pegg, theres Dylan Moran from Black Books, Lucy Davis from The Office and cameo roles from two others from both those series. Whilst I didn't find it laugh out loud all the time, it always kept me interested and surprisingly there are a number of quite moving moments.

Of course this film wouldn't have existed but for George Romero's classic zombie movies, so just like in his Dawn of the Dead (largely set in a shopping mall) until their numbers are overwhelming the zombies are really pretty useless. In some ways this film is similar to Mel Brooks classic 'Young Frankenstein', which itself was a comedy based on a classic horror film. In both cases the films are affectionate parodies rather than straight spoofs.

He works in a dead-end job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate, Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend, Liz, decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step-dad who's slowly turning into a zombie.

Don't let the title and premise fool you, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead, it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead. The film is also very clever, with a clear social commentary running throughout. The jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any non-Londoners. It's actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the UK and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw. But if you do get it, then good for you, because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here. The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies, ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The humour comes thick and fast, never have I laughed so consistantly during any film before, it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes, all of which work surprisingly well. In fact the film tends to genre-hop quite a lot, and while some find this unappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though, you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well, no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok, that wasn't long ago, but before that I don't think there was a film that was so rip-roaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie, and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it. It's not without its faults though, losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll.

Shaun Of The Dead is a great film. It's funny, it's clever and it's got zombies in it! Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve. Go watch it, you'll laugh till it hurts!",1161043200,2,3543,4.224188790560472
2106402,5,B0002MJT0I,"As ridiculous as it sounds, the description on the cover of the DVD (""A romantic comedy. With zombies."") is completely true. Shaun of the Dead, of course being a pun on one of Romero's zombie flicks Dawn of the Dead, starts out with a glimpse into a very bad day in Shaun's (Simon Pegg) life: Shaun's flatmate Pete badgers him about his other flatmate and best friend for life Ed (Nick Frost) who is an unemployed slob, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him for being unreliable, and his teenage subordinates at his dead-end job make him feel increasingly old and obsolete. At least it's not the end of the world, right? The next day, Shaun humorously goes about his routine in the exact same way, not taking care to notice the zombie infestation that occured literally overnight until Ed points out a strange girl in the garden. With the truth suddenly dawning on them, Shaun and Ed head out to rescue Liz and her flatmates along with Shaun's mother and stepfather. What seemed like a perfect plan falls victim to increasingly more complicated hitches as the movie goes on until it's no longer a spoof on the zombie genre but a very real, emotionally charged drama set inside the events of a zombie outbreak. Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright continue their series of excellent ideas from their hilarious sitcom Spaced with some of the best screenwriting and directing in years. Shaun of the Dead is every pop culture fanboy's dream: the script is filled to the brim with zombie references from sources as obvious as Night of the Living Dead to the obscure videogame Zombies Ate My Neighbors, not to mention a million other homages to just about every other form of mass media (for example, the debate around The Stone Roses' widely criticized Second Coming in comparison to their debut). Not only does Shaun of the Dead reference those numerous outside sources but it is self-referential as well, the whole second day of the movie being an almost word-for-word recurrence of the first with the dialogue providing a hilarious irony that takes several viewings of the film to fully appreciate. To make things better, the cast's comic timing is superb to the point of almost being able to work telepathically with each other and Edgar Wright's use of camera angles and distinct images not only pays respects to the classics that he so reveres but also demonstrates his enormous talent in creating films with a style all his own. Shaun of the Dead is easily the most rewarding movie of its kind for at least a decade and one can only hope that the excellent output from the geniuses behind it will continue long into the 21st century.",1160006400,,2642,4.733188720173536
2106403,5,B0002MJT0I,This is a great spoof of all of the zombie movies out there.  A slick social commentary on modern society where we are all kind of zombies.  And it's funny too!,1160006400,,160,4.129032258064516
2106404,5,B0002MJT0I,"Like all good parodies, ""Shaun of the Dead"" manages to both mock and provide a good example of the genre it's spoofing. Bloody, morbid, and even a bit scary, this film is also so funny you may find yourself laughing at an embarassing volume. Granted, the gallows humor may be too dark for many--a graphic disembowelment may kill the movie for some viewers--but for those who take a secret delight in watching civilization and human relationships get pushed to the brink, this movie will entertain even after multiple viewings.

Oddly enough, the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a deadpan (har har) satire on American consumerism, and it's fun to see those themes reemerge in a more obviously humorous setting. The opening credits make it clear that zombies are already among us, and they are us. Yet somehow a man who's grown dead to life manages to rise (""from his couch,"" as the trailer proclaims) to grasp onto a few fleeting moments left in the face of worldwide destruction. As a modern fable, we could do worse.

Be sure to watch this movie twice to catch all the background humor. Also, the ""plot holes"" fill in the gaps of the more unbelievable scenes with narrated comic strips. A great addition to any film library.",1158796800,,1225,4.719626168224299
2106405,4,B0002MJT0I,"Simon Pegg is hilarious as Shaun in this British horror spoof.  Shaun is a man trying to get his life straight.  He can't seem to seperate from his best friend long enough to establish a stable relationship with his girlfriend Liz, but once zombies start eating everyone in sight Shaun has a chance as redemption.  Alongside his mother, his best friend, his girlfriend and her friends they fight for survival against the flesh eating zombies.

When I think of spoofs I usually think of the spoofs gone horribly wrong, like most do, but 'Shaun of the Dead' was such a nice diversion from the general crap sludged out by studios today and passed off as entertainment.  It was funny, witty and at some times even a bit scary.  The British humor is not always my cup of tea, but it's approached brilliantly here that every minute is enjoyable.  From their attempts to fight off the undead with vinyl records to their journey to the local pub for safe keeping, 'Shaun of the Dead' is sure to please the viewer no matter what your opinion is of British humor or the spoof in general.

Great bloody fun!",1158192000,,1096,4.5561224489795915
2106406,5,B0002MJT0I,"Right off the bat, you need to understand that this movie is funny. It is far more funny than it is scary. Although I suppose that depends on what you consider scary.

The jokes are great and range from the playground variety fart jokes to far more subtle and mind tweaking samples.

So, mix a little horror with a lot of comedy and ... believe it or not ... a story that is more about breaking yourself out of the daily grind and discovering that the daily grind might have had its good points after all!

It's about a world where folks stumble through their lives, zombie-like only to punctuate each beginning and ending of the day with some meaningless ritual - whether it's the pub, the tube or that damn game console! But in this story, everyone becomes the zombies they have been living like. You see there? Thats subtext.... just sit back and bask in its glow for a second. Done? Excellent... moving on.

No matter what level of entertainment your looking for, your likely to find it here. Don't give a rats bottom about the underlying commentary the story makes on our day to day lives? They fuhgettaboutit and enjoy.",1157587200,,1125,4.527093596059113

Excellent. My friends and I quote it regularly!",1156550400,,261,4.0588235294117645
2106409,5,B0002MJT0I,"IF you're looking for a farcical, slapstick Will Farrell type comedy, I'll guarantee you WON'T like SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  BUT, if you like wry, subtle humor this movie is worth a look!  I didn't expect much the first time I watched, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD delivered laughs, adventure, romance and realistic characters.  WELL ACTED, WELL SCRIPTED and WELL DONE!  Does require an attention span of more than video game proportions to appreciate the subtle, recuring humor themes throughout the movie.  Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield are excellent throughout, as are the supporting cast.  Zombies are well done, too--not overblown or overly silly.  Some gore, but nothing gratuitous.  Well edited.  Overall, 2 hours of well acted, quality entertainment!  DVD extras are OK--not great, but the commentary is worth a listen.  Also, the OUTTAKES are rather good.  As a package, this DVD rates FIVE STARS in my book.  The humor doesn't get old or lose it's punch after multiple viewings and the story keeps you entertained through the whole length of the film.

Again, NOT FOR ALL TASTES--if you LIKED the AIRPLANE movies, ANCHORMAN, ELF or similar films, you'll probably NOT ""get"" the humor in this movie.  But, if you're like me and you found the aforementioned films to be dull and senseless, then you'll probably find SHAUN OF THE DEAD to be a barrel of laughs (and who doesn't like ZOMBIES????).  Transcends the British/American humor gap as well.  Usually British humor doesn't register with me, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD seemed to hit the mark with a more universal type ""real world"" humor.  Overcomes the old ""two peoples separated by a common language"" problem as well--no need for a translator!!  Writers made a conscious effort to avoid slang with differing American/British meanings, so everything makes sense no matter which variety of English you speak!

TO RECAP:  Wry, subtle humor that requires you to pay attention throughout the film--NOT a slapstick, silly comedy.  Lots of zombie action with traditional zombies--nothing overly silly.  Well acted, realistic, real world characters you can relate to.  Well scripted, well edited and entertaining!  Even has a HAPPY ENDING!  FIVE STARS!",1156377600,,2201,5.095238095238095

2106412,4,B0002MJT0I,"Like ""Napoleon Dynamite"", this was another little gem that others were talking about, but I was slow to catch up on. Thanks to my discovery of ""On Demand"", I found it!. I have to say that I am usually not drawn to British films, or zombie films(with some exceptions), so I never paid much attention to this film. Then the word got out. Having now seen it, the word is right. This movie is a funny, gory blast from start to finish. It has all the zombie cliches in there, and it has a heck of a time having fun with it all. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a clerk at a store selling refrigerators and such. His life is a bit of a mess. He is having relationship issues with his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield), his roomates, and his stepfather Phillip(Bill Nighy). But soon, the area is overtaken by zombies. The dead are rising and attacking the living. Get bit, and it's only a matter of time. What's really brilliant about the film is how the script just has all these zombie things popping up in the background and all around Shaun, while our hapless hero just goes on with life as if nothing is going on. It's wonderfully conceived and sharply directed. Before long, Shaun and his friend Ed(Nick Frost), are getting everyone together and battling the zombies to stay alive. Shoot them in the head!. Yes, you are treated to head explosions, and brains splattering here and there. Gotta love it. The movie is also very funny. What was surprising to me, was that the humor was also kind of American as well. The cast itself is up for the fun, and Pegg makes Shaun very likeable and relatable. Nick Frost's Ed is the overgrown college friend 10 years later who never leaves. Nighy is a superb actor(and he's great as Davy Jones in the new ""Pirates"" movie), and he makes the most of his role here as Shaun's stepfather. I wished there was more of him. The movie doesn't really have any huge social significance like the zombie films of George Romero, but it celebrates all the fun of the zombie movie, with having nice humor along for the ride. Some fans don't like the mix, but it works like gangbusters here. Who else can resist our band of heroes fighting the zombies with Queen blaring on the jukebox?. So, what exactly is the plot with the zombies?. Not much. They gave some reason, but really, it's a passing thought. It's all about the gore, the head smacks, the humor, and the notion of this extraordinary thing happening to ordinary people with extra ordinary lives.",1153612800,,2477,4.506666666666667
2106413,5,B0002MJT0I,Shaun of the Dead is a wonderfully funny movie.  Even the extras on the DVD offer a informative and clever side to the writers and director of this great movie.  I highly recommend this film to non-zombie and zombie fans alike!,1152662400,,227,4.512195121951219

2106415,5,B0002MJT0I,"Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.

But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny ""Shaun of the Dead,"" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).

Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.

""Shaun"" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.

""Shaun of the Dead"" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (""Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet..."")

Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.

Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.

As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? ""Stone Roses?"" ""No."" ""...Second Coming?"" ""I liked it."" ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.

While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, ""Shaun of the Dead"" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, almost dead.",1152057600,4,2956,4.713178294573644

Starring Simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as his mate Ed, SHAUN takes the piss out of zombie movies with its referential dialogue and many scenes of having fun with the recently resurrected (such as trying to take them out with Shaun's prized record collection).

  SHAUN follows the typical zombie structure with its group of mismatched survivors constantly seeking safety from the flesh eating former folks.  Completely unprepared for the walking dead, our heroes use an assortment of shovels, cricket bats, and other blunt objects to fend off the zombie menace.  Apparently they never read Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide!

The dialogue is witty and the plot is well-conceived. You will laugh. You will probably be like me and play certain parts over and over just to laugh some more. You will be compelled to feel sad. You just also may get a little frightened. Few movies can withdraw these three emotions, and Shaun of the Dead does so brilliantly.

It's like they're watching their own lives on TV and aren't the least bit involved or even interested.

2106423,5,B0002MJT0I,"Who's the real zombie in this 2004 flick?  ""Shaun of the Dead"" stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a man with no real ambition who meanders through his daily routines.  He seems quite content with his job at an electronics store, going to the Winchester (the local pub), and hanging out with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) and his roommate Ed (Nick Frost).  But things take a drastic turn when Liz gives him an ultimatum.

After Liz breaks up with him, things for Shaun go from bad to worse.  Oblivious to the news reports of strange things happening in the vicinity, Shaun goes about his day until he and Ed notice a stranger in their backyard.  At first assuming that the lady is drunk, Shaun and Ed quickly realize the predicament they're in.  So what do they do?  They immediately run to the television to see the local news while they're having tea.

Soon, with cricket bat in tow, the pair devises a plan.  First, the two concoct several scenarios to save Shaun's mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), who has already been bitten by a zombie.  Although they differ, at first, on where they should end up, one thing is for sure, they're going to kill Philip.  The next part of the plan is to rescue Liz and her friends Diane (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran).  After that, they'll comfortably stay at the Winchester until all is well once again.  But with flesh eating zombies on the loose, will the group survive long enough to make it to the pub?

""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of those pleasantly surprising gems!  It also isn't your typical zombie movie.  The situation with the zombies seems almost secondary to the dilemmas facing the main cast.  The characters deliver great performances and good comedic timing.  (One of the funnier moments is when Diane is trying to teach the others how to act like zombies so they can blend in with them.)

Although the movie has more comedic moments than your typical horror movie, it's important to remember that the film may not be for everyone.  There are a few scenes that have plenty of gore.

Shaun: Don't say that!

Ed: What?

Shaun: That!

Ed: What?

Shaun: The zed-word. Don't say it!

Ed: Why not?

Shaun: Because it's ridiculous!

Ed: Well...are they any?

Shaun: [looking out the door mail slot, he sees an empty street] I don't see any. Maybe it's not as bad as all that.

Shaun: [turns his head and sees a pack of zombies] Oh, no, wait, there they are.",1143936000,,922,4.3609467455621305

But I found this movie to be amusing enough that it was well worth it to pay nine bucks for twice and eventually buy on DVD.  It was awesome.  You will love this film if you enjoy Zombie Movies, British Humor, Video Games, Violence/Gore, and quirky, odd films.  Shaun of the Dead isn't necessarily a parody of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead/Night of the Living Dead.  It's more like a comedy take on the film set during the same time as Romero's Dead series but set in England.  Calling it a Parody just doesn't sound right because it doesn't really poke fun at zombie films like Spaceballs pokes fun at Star Wars.  It's more like Lucio Fulci's unintentional sequel Zombi 2.  Except this one is funny.

Some people are flabbergasted that ""this movie got good reviews"".  Well just because you like English Humor, doesn't guarantee that you'll like this movie.  You will LOVE this movie if you love all the things I mentioned earlier.  If that still isn't the case...Well then, I'd be pretty surprised.

The DVD is worth it.  The extras add quite a bit to the movie.  Featured are Bloopers, explanations to Plotholes, deleted scenes, a fake interview with Coldplay (I don't care for them but it was funny), casting tapes and so on.  So if you already love the movie, get the DVD.  If you have never seen it before and you love all those things I mentioned earlier, rent the movie then proceed to want to see it again and again and then simply Buy it so you can watch it whenever.

Interesting fact: Actors Simon Pegg (Shaun) and Nick Frost (Ed) played 2 Zombies in George Romero's Land of the Dead.",1143849600,,1717,4.459807073954984
2106428,2,B0002MJT0I,"I really expected to love this movie.. I love horror movies, black comedies, British comedy, etc... but this movie really missed the mark for me and my friends who watched it together.  The main complaint was predictability and simply tediousnous... I think most of us could have written something as uninspired.  Sitting there you're mainly expecting the obvious to happen...and big surprise...it does...the exact thing that every unimaginative sap would expect to happen.  I'm not expecting fricking Dostoyevsky here, but just because the genre is goofy horror doesn't mean there can't be elements of actual horror or actual comedy.  The only thing I really liked was Bill Nighy, who is a great actor and was funny (but I should say I think the actors were all fine- though the girlfriend's obnoxiousness was either overplayed or one more annoying element, the script just stank).

Hey, you probably love this movie and disagree, but I would encourage those who haven't seen it and EXPECT to like it to rent it first (unless you have some compulsive shopping problem!) or you can be a mindless, capitalist zombie and buy it.",1143763200,6,1126,5.0

I went out and bought the movie the next day.

This movie was SO much  more than I expected.

The humour, despite what some people have come to expect from 'comedy' movies, isn't blatant slapstick humour.  Some of it is very subtle.  And the whole movie is peppered with subtle jokes, along with the more obvious ones.  I prefer this type of intelligent humuor over some of the other stuff.

And there is more than just humour.  Never before in a movie have I laughed so hard, then cried, then laughed, then cried.  Very well done.

The acting?  Superb.  Simon Pegg does a bang up job as Shaun, the dead-beat going through the worst day in his sad little life.

Being the Coldplay addict that I am, I originally only wanted to see Shaun of the Dead because I knew that Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland were making a cameo in it somewhere. But three minutes into it, I forgot all about that because I was laughing so much. Very entertaining film. I've seen it six times already. There's comedy in the smallest of things, is that the definition of British humor? Because if that's so, I'm just one of the few Americans who understand it. You should certainly watch this flick if you're looking for a dose of non-stop comedy, drama,and horror rolled all into one. Also if you have a good sense of humor.",1139702400,,651,4.564102564102564
2106437,5,B0002MJT0I,"The blurb on the front of the DVD case says all you need to know.  ""A smash hit romantic comedy, with zombies.""  Really, what more do you need to hear.

Many people mistakenly think this is a spoof movie or a parody of Dawn of the Dead, the remake of which came out unfortunatally close to the release of Shaun (I think there's even a Shaun trailer on the Dawn DVD) and the names are similar, but this is not the case.  Shaun of the Dead is a great zombie movie in its own right and nails both the horror and the comedy.

The comedy in the film is so slick you may have to watch multiple times to catch it all.  It is that almost dry but witty British humor that when done right can be ten times as funny as the loud in your face humor we get in the states.  You need to listen to all the quips from Shaun's loser buddy Ed (who has an excellen loser gap cut into his hair.  Just something you have to notice to realize how funny that is) pay attention to all the back ground action (was that couple making out or was she just eating his neck?) and watch closly to get all the cool little jokes.  Don't worry there are still some nice fall down humor and inappropriate words to giggle at.

You can see the love of the zombie films these film makers have and the layers they use to tell their story is amazing.  In a pair of inventive scenes we see Shuan walking down the street like a zombie himself to the store not noticing the world around him because he just does not care.  Later we see him on the same walk, this time not noticing anything because he's thinking about sorting his life out and not noticing that a zombie invasion is begining around him (another great background scene by the way). Also inventive is the use of foreshadowing.  Notice when Ed says they should drink all day tomorrow starting with a bloody mary and ending up at the pub that this is what happens... kind of.  Notice the name tag of the first zombie they bloody up and where they end up at the end of the day.  Or there is the more obvious, ""The next time I see him he's dead,"" comment from Ed.

There's a whole slew of this kind of thing along with the fact its a great comedy and horror (don't believe me?  Well don't be eating spaghetti near the end of the film is all I have to say) and I could go on way longer than needed.  Check it out.

There are funny parts through the movie but not enough for it to pass off as a comedy, there also isn't one laugh out moment through the whole movie. Also I really dislike the british accents and their sense of humor is just boring and sometimes confusing.

2106441,4,B0002MJT0I,"Having missed this at the cinema but read the raving reviews in the english press, I was looking forward to sitting down and finally catching this film on DVD.  It begins very well, almost perfectly, the first scenes featuring snappy direction and camera tricks together with amusing 'we're all zombies now' references ie. everybody in a bus queue lifting their mobile phones up and texting in unison.  The film continues in the same vein, marred only in my opinion by the fact that many of the characters (especially Ed) are just too damned annoying to care about. I almost punched my fist in the air when certain of them got eaten alive. Ok, this is clearly a comedy film parodying the zombie genre, and much of it is indeed very clever and amusing, but some people (I would think especially the american audience) will find the personalities just too irritating to get involved with.  Still, on the whole this parody is affectionate and sophisticated enough to be liked (and even loved) by both fans of zombie movies and of british comedy alike.",1137628800,3,1048,4.747252747252747

2106444,5,B0002MJT0I,"I do enjoy the horror/comedy features, a few of my favorites being Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (1992) aka Braindead, and the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell Evil Dead features...so why did it take me so long to see this film titled Shaun of the Dead (2004)?  You know what it was?  I had a number of people keep telling me how I had to go see this film and usually, when that happens, I tend to avoid the very film they're pushing as something inside becomes resistant to the pressure...I'll see a movie because I want to, not because some told me I have to...I still haven't read The Da Vinci Code, despite the fact someone even gave me their copy of the book...anyway, the film, co-written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, who also directed, stars Simon Pegg (Mission: Impossible III), as the title character.  Also appearing is Kate Ashfield (Fakers), Nick Frost (""Spaced""), Lucy Davis (""The Office""), Dylan Moran (Notting Hill), Penelope Wilton (Calendar Girls), and Bill Nighy (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), who can soon be seen appearing in Pirates of the Caribbean sequels as a character named Davey Jones, in reference to that old sea legend Davey Jones' locker, and not in reference to the character from the 1960s TV show the Monkees, which was played by an actor of the same name.

Shaun (Pegg) has problems...he works a dead end job in a chintzy appliance store (his teenage co-workers consider him the `old timer' being all of 29), he doesn't get along with his step dad Phillip (Nighy), which has strained his relationship with his mother (Wilton), his girlfriend Liz (Ashfield) is in the process of dumping him because she wants more out of their relationship, and his flat mate Pete is on his case about Shaun's friend Ed (Frost), who lives with them but contributes very little...you know the type, a big, greasy bohunk type who stays over one night, and then ends up moving in, sleeping on the couch, doesn't pay rent, drinks milk from the carton, and spends his days playing video games and his nights at the local pub.  Shaun's life is a mess, and it's about to get a whole lot messier, as it seems an American satellite has crashed somewhere in the south of England, resulting in the dead coming back to life, feasting on the flesh of the living, which then creates more of the same...at first Shaun doesn't notice the not so subtle changes of those on the street, until one of the dead wanders into the garden of his flat (at first, Shaun and Ed think the woman is hammered).  As the situation becomes clear, Shaun tries to hold it together, gathering his friends and family with the intent on barricading themselves in the local pub and waiting it out, but the dead are hungry, and if they don't get Shaun and his group, tensions from within surely will...

I had a lot of fun with this film, as any fan of the zombie films should, at least those who don't take things too seriously and can stand a movie that pokes a little fun at the genre.  The comedy in the film isn't so much of the slapsticky kind (there is some) featured in the films I referenced at the beginning of my review, but more so a subtle kind that I found really appealing.  While watching the movie one familiar with films that came before can't help but feel those responsible for this feature are true fans of the genre, and horror films in general, given the immense amount of references included, in terms of visuals, the script, and various other aspects of the production, all of which can be identified by activating a special Zomb-O-Meter subtitle track.  I also really enjoyed the thoughtfulness in the structure of the movie, for example, near the beginning, before the influx of the zombies, we see Shaun walking to a nearby store, and there's a good amount of normal, street activity (a kid playing, a man washing his car, a homeless man begging for change, etc.).  The next day, after Shaun got dumped by Liz and subsequently went out with Ed and tied one on, we see a slightly hung over Shaun, walking the same, exact route, except now things are very different.  The streets are clear of people (except for a few presumably walking dead), strewn with trash and in disarray, yet Shaun, given his current state, does not take notice...very funny sequence.  Another great bit was when Shaun and Ed finally realized what was going on, after an incident in the backyard and one of the dead actually entering the flat, because, as usual, someone forgot to lock the front door (this was persistent issue with Shaun's roommate Pete, who despised Ed).  As the story progresses, Shaun seems to come to terms with his relationship issues, generally at the most inopportune moments, one of them being a very touching scene with his step father Phil in the back of a car, just prior to Phil `losing the battle'.  Another great sequence in this regard was when Shaun and Ed had it out, in front of the pub, surrounded by hundreds of dead eyed spectators.  I thought the performances all really good (both Pegg and Frost stood out for me), and the characters completely distinctive and interesting.  The direction was excellent, as the use of various gimmicks done especially well, keeping me interested rather than distracting.  As far as the zombies and special effects in general, I thought they were all done very well, resulting in excellent production values for a film of this type, this type being a relatively independent feature made on a relatively modest budget (this film cost a reportedly 4 million to make, while George Romero's 2005 Land of the Dead cost about 15 million).  The zombie effects are decent enough, and there is one, particularly gut wrenching (literally) near the end which casual viewers might find hard to take.  All in all I thought this an excellent film and a great effort put forth by the filmmakers, one which all fans of the genre should appreciate, but may have limited appeal to the casual viewer not familiar with all the `in' jokes and references (some were obscure, even to me).

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks very sharp and clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very clean.  As far as the special features, there are a good amount of them related to the film, of which I won't list as the Amazon website does this well enough, but not so much as to overwhelm...I love those releases where they interview everyone and anyone, despite their peripheral involvement in the making of the film (does anyone care what kind of snackies the caterer supplied during production?).  Also included are some unrelated Universal previews that come up as the DVD is inserted into the player, but these can be bypassed through your remote.  Used to be Universal gave you no choice in watching these things, but I guess they got enough complaints as to allow viewers to bypass them if they wish...

while the film is intended to be equal parts horror and romantic comedy, i doubt that it will keep you awake at night. there is considerable bloodshed, particularly in a scene where irritating irish git david is pulled out a window by marauding zombies and eaten alive (mercifully, the film's creators don't allow us to see david's ressurrected corpse trailing entrails all over the place). i thought one of the most intriguing bits was at the very beginning, in which the viewer watches various individuals whose lives are caught up in dreary, mundane routines whose movements and demeanor are already zombie-like. the filmmakers refuse to provide an ultimate explanation for the plague of flesh-eating undead, thus reinforcing the message that modern life makes zombies of us all. the film's conclusion offers a humourous twist, as the survivors of ""z-day"" come up with a unique solution for dealing with the hideous undead that still walk among them.",1132704000,3,1539,5.0078125

The zombie action begins with Shaun totally unaware as he goes about his morning routine. After short walk to the market he casually selects his beverage from a case covered with bloody handprints, slips on blood (I assume) as he heads toward the counter, tells the living-dead storeowner that he owes him 5 pence and returns home, passing gory and comical undead scenes along the way. With absolutely no clue of what's going on. Until he and his roommate Ed find the ""drunk"" girl in their garden.

2106455,4,B0002MJT0I,"The horror genre has an interesting relationship to comedy. Ever since A Nightmare on Elm Street decided to make Freddy Kreuger a stand-up comedian during his slashing sequences, the dividing line has become more and more blurred, until we reach this film, Shaun of the Dead, which is simulaneously a romantic comedy, a straight-up zombie movie and a send-up of zombie movies. It is very well done, it is very smart.

Because of all it brings to the table, the movie can be enjoyed by just about anyone, but fans of horror films (and zombie movies in particular) will get the most out of the references and allusions. For instance, in one of the first shots of the film, we see Shaun stumbing around his apartment, half-asleep--his walk is 100% ""zombie-walk,"" and you'll chuckle if you know what the ""zombie-walk"" looks like; when he yawns, making the ""zombie-moan,"" it helps to know what it sounds like.

But for all of the in-jokes, the movie never gets too distracted by them and instead concentrates on telling a basic boy-loses-girl/tries-to-get-girl-back story, surrounded by Satan spawn who eat human flesh.

The romance works, the parody works (I'd say Comic *Silver*, as opposed to Comic Gold), the horror kind of works. A worthy example of genre-bending. A fun movie to watch.",1131321600,2,1286,4.917050691244239
2106456,3,B0002MJT0I,"I'm American, but I enjoy a lot of British humor - Monty Python, Black Adder, Red Dwarf, etc. - and I was hoping that ""Shaun of the Dead"" would be up to that level of wit. It isn't.  Yes, there are some funny moments. And the notion that most people lurch through life so bored and oblivious that they wouldn't even notice if their city were overrun by zombies is given a thorough workout. But once you get past that, there's not a lot going for ""Shaun."" The first half is dreadfully slow, and the ending is too gore-filled for an alleged comedy.

For the most part,  ""Shaun"" is just another zombie movie, patterned on George Romero's ""Living Dead"" series, but set in London. It does a good job of showing how ordinary - even stupid - people might try to cope with an onslaught of the living dead, but it doesn't really bring much new to the genre.  It reminded me, occasionally, of ""The Young Ones,"" but it's not nearly as funny.  If you want horror mixed with comedy, try Bruce Campell's ""Evil Dead""  movies or ""Bubba Ho-Tep.""",1130976000,3,1028,4.412698412698413

2106462,5,B0002MJT0I,"The recent surge of horror remakes has been replete with glossy, flashy movies full of generic scores mixed with meaningless nu-metal music, unoriginal storylines, carnage suitable only for cookie-cutter teen audiences, and the problem of taking themselves all too seriously. What's happened to the inventive, darkly funny horror films of yester-year, such as ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Dead Alive""? Hollywood has all but forgotten what once made horror films great, but it seems that the UK is out to remind them. First with ""28 Days Later"", a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre, and now with ""Shaun of the Dead"", a hilarious romantic zombie comedy, or ""rom-zom-com"".

""Shaun of the Dead"" is about, well, Shaun (Pegg), a man who is at a crossroads in his life. He works a dead-end job, he lives with his slob of a best friend, Ed (Frost), and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Ashfield). In the midst of trying to sort all of this out, a zombie epidemic just happens to break out, and this only ""exacerbates"" things for him.

Right from the first frame, we get the feeling that this is a thoroughly complete horror comedy, as right away it features The Goblins' score for the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". The references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly, as the film gives a nod to everything from Romero's ""Dead"" series (obviously) to ""The Evil Dead"" to Lucio Fulci. The way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and well-handled, featuring several brilliant sequences, one of which shows Shaun routinely walking the streets of London on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead, or, dare I say it, the ""dawn of the dead"" (insert eye-roll here), without even noticing the difference. But what really makes the film outstanding is not just the horror element, but the fact that this would be a hysterical and wonderful film even without the zombie twist. The acting is excellent, especially from Simon Pegg, who delivers gags with perfect comic timing, pulls off heated confrontations expertly, and even nails the film's demanding emotional scenes (yes, there are demanding emotional scenes).

Not only does the film keep the laughs and the inventiveness flowing, but it also delivers what so many of the sleek Hollywood horror remakes of late have been forgetting: gore. It's complete with squirting blood, gushing bites, head-shots, and even a disembowling. Also, the ending, though something of a deus ex machina, is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaser.

Edward Wright (co-writer/director) and Simon Pegg (co-writer) have delivered a film that will satisfy the demands of horror purists, romantic comedy fans, and just about every other kind of moviegoer there is (except for maybe the teens that are in love with ""The Grudge"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004)), for it is truly a film that doesn't forget any of the elements of a great horror movie, comedy, or drama.

2106463,4,B0002MJT0I,"While ""Shaun of the Dead"" wasn't as drop-dead funny as I'd hoped it would be, in the end it amounted to much more than the dogpile of semi-related gags my preconceptions would have necessarily entailed it to be. The movie starts off a bit slow, the laughs early on coming few and far between for the first half hour, but in hindsight this is all legitimate character development. When I say that the film turned out to be something more than it promised to be, what I mean is exactly this: whereas most filmmakers would have focused on the slapstick possibilities inherent in a world full of slow moving, incompetent zombies, ""Shaun of the Dead"" instead treats this as a mere backdrop to illustrate the quest for one man's redemption. Shaun is a man who, through a combination of moral sluggishness and a willingness to be walked on by those more assertive than he, finds himself entirely behind the eightball in life at nearly every turn. The first scene in the film shows Shaun already on thin ice with his girlfriend. To the viewer, it becomes obvious that Shaun's boorishness comes from a fear of going outside the box of his everyday routine, and why should he when even in the course of this routine things never fail to go wrong? But his girlfriend doesn't quite see it this way, and whatever sympathy she may have for Shaun is rapidly eroding away under a veneer of strained patience. To placate her, Shaun cooks up a romantic evening at an upscale restaurant to celebrate their anniversary, then conveniently forgets to call in the reservation until the day of the gig, at which point, of course, the question of a table is decidedly OUT of the question. It's against these events that the zombies first begin to make their appearance, at first as individuals who are easily mistaken for drunks and the homeless by the hapless Shaun and his roommate. The zombies begin to gradually increase in number until a fateful encounter in the back garden convinces Shaun of their lifelessness, at which point the movie becoms a rescue mission to salvage his mom and his (now ex-)girlfriend. There are a number of other auxiliary characters, most of which are fleshed out quite well considering most horror flicks would relegate them as faceless flesh-bait for the antagonists. To say too much more would be to lessen the effect of some of the key plot twists, although to be honest most of these twists will be familiar to fans of previous zombie films. But the film isn't to be noted for it's plot, but for the way it handles it's characters, particularly Shaun, who is shaken out of his cocoon of inaction by the even greater incompetence of his friends and family. Once survival itself is at stake and things are no longer just a matter of comfort and convenience, Shaun finds a resolve inside himself that he likely didn't know he had (his entourage certainly seems surprised). And yet the movie never descends into an over-the-top Rambo cliche, like the American version surely must when Hollywood inevitably gets around to remaking ""Shaun of the Dead"", and it's the small scale of the human drama that makes it that much more realistic, and hence more effective.",1129248000,3,3168,4.730560578661844

It is definitely not a spoof.  It's a zombie movie.  People die in hideous fashion not in the cartoonish ways of ""Scary Movie"" et al.  There are also some emotional moments that harken back to the master of zombies himself; George A. Romero.

I noticed that the Americans that wrote poor reviews also complained they couldn't understand the accents of the main characters, it's an English film that was only released in the U.S.A because of its success in Britain amd therefore was never meant to be seen by most americans so their lack of understanding English accents was never taken into account in the filming of the movie, much like the filming of many American films that British people have trouble understanding so stop complaining and enjoy a true cult classic.",1128038400,4,867,4.6
2106468,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun Of The Dead is great British Film. This zombie film filled with homage's & parodies of zombies films & other kinds of films. This movie shows how people have a great love for films.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a clerk in a electronics & that does not really want his life to evolve. He has a girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) for three years not trying to get the relationship more serious. His best friend Ed (Nick Frost) is slacker. Until his girlfriend breaks up with him does realize that he has to change his life around. But something unlucky happens. Zombies! Now he has to change his life around,win back his girlfriend & fight of zombies to survive.

Also their very good supporting characters of David & Diane (there is a injoke that they look like Harry Potter & Britney Spears).There is Shaun's stepfather played by Bill Nighy that everybody knows form Underworld & Love Accuatly. There also Shaun's other roomate thats uptight and was accautly the voice of Darth Maul in the Phantom Menace.

The funny thing about this movie is that its truly funny as hell. A lot of great jokes. There are numerous jokes to mention. They way how when zombies start to show up Shaun passes by a number of them with out having a clue that they are zombies. Or that he uses records as weapons or how they imitate zombies to get passed them.

This dvd is packed with goodies. It has 4 commentaries. One by the Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg. On by the whole cast. One other with two other actors & one more with zombies. People who played zombies i meant. Aso lots of deleted & extended scenes. Also a couple behind the scenes videos. Also trailers & other miscalennous thing on the dvd.

The guys that made this film also made a Tv Series in Britain called Spaced that is very cool & funny as film. With great jokes & parodies to Resident Evil even to The Conversation. So if you like the move give the tv show a try.

I love this film. Its one of my favorite films of 2004. This movies has everything romance,comedy,good performances,great direction as well as writing and most of all Zombies!!!Pick this up you won't regret it.",1127952000,9,2116,4.4831168831168835

2106470,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a 29-year-old electronics store employee.  Shaun is an entirely likable and sympathetic character, who gets dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) for various reasons; his bad habits, hanging out with his best friend and roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), who neither works nor pays any rent to speak of, and for never taking her anywhere except The Winchester, a local pub.

The story centers around Shaun, Ed, Liz, David (Dylan Moran), Dianne (Lucy Davis) and Shaun's mother, Barbara (Penelope Wilton), whose husband and Shaun's stepfather, Philip, is played impeccably by Bill Nighy.  Peter Serafinowicz is also quite good as Shaun and Ed's roommate, Pete.  And of course, there are the zombies.

After the zombies appear throughout the city, Shaun goes about his normal morning, not even noticing that his neighborhood is running, or more appropriately, walking with zombies.  A very appealing, albeit disheartening, comment on society contained in this film is that many people move listlessly through life, like zombies.  Shaun doesn't detect any difference at first.

Down and out after Liz's dumping, Shaun (and Ed) take charge; save Mum, save Liz, and go to The Winchester, a secure and familiar place.  David and Dianne decide to tag along.

From beginning to end, the movie consists of one hilarious scene after another, but the movie is not without its poignancy.

It contains some of the funniest scenes ever, including a side-splitting performance of ""White Lines"" by Shaun and Ed, with a little help from a neighborhood zombie.  Another scene, among many, which comes to mind is one in which the crew mimic an impaled zombie with the intention of blending into the crowd of zombies to make it across the street to The Winchester.

The film is absolute fun the entire way through.  I had to watch it several times just to hear the lines I'd missed from having laughed uproariously over them.  Brilliant writing and acting, with flawless timing.  It is a perfect blend of horror and comedy, with just the right amount of gore.

Shaun and his roommate are slackers. While his roommate plays video games all day long, Shaun goes to the store and then he either goes back home, or goes to work. Little does he know after a while that zombies are roaming the streets of London and they are after Shaun and his friends and family, killing everyone in their paths. If Shaun doesn't destroy them, they'd kill every last one of them. Shaun only needs to find a way to fight back in funny ways. One of my favorite scenes is where they {Shaun and his friend} try to figure out what to throw at a female zombie that is in their yard. They try records, cricket bats, and all kinds of other things. That's already pretty much how things are with the rest of the movie and the plot is easy. It starts a little slow but gets gorier and funnier later on, especially in the final tavern scene with all of the zombies which is basically everybody in England except Shaun and the others.

My hopes were all realised when I went to see this film... and I can't begin to tell you how much pride we Brits take in his success.

Simon Pegg has excelled himself by co-writing and starring in the Rom-Com-Zom as Shaun, a boring everyday British bloke. The cast is an amazing plethora of current (as well as timeless) British comedy talent, many of whom, like Simon Pegg, had been lurking in the shadows of cultdom for far too long.

Special mention goes to the very cool Bill Nighy, playing Shaun's dad... Nick Frost is disgustingly brilliant as Shaun's slob of a best maye... and watch out for the AMAZING Dylan Moran in the role of David, Shaun's enemy and a lecturer.

You should definately give this film a go... it sums up a certain essence of British comedy, as well as the mood of the current day here in England.

But don't think the comedy in this film is entirely English, and no one else will understand it or think it's funny... trust me, you will. Also, the numerous iconic film quotes peppered throughout the film is interesting enough, and hilarious to hear taken out of context.

This is a homage to all the zombie films you have ever seen and loved, as well as a milestone in both British filmaking (think Trainspotting) and new British Comedy.

2106481,5,B0002MJT0I,"First off, i give it 5 stars because i AM slightly biased. I absolutley loved the film, thought it was hilarious but there are a  few reasons why i would..

First off its British, and so am i. Do the 'maths'.

Secondly, and more importantly, its a result of Simon Pegg, who has been (as we say here) round the houses in terms of British comedy, and is part of the integral circle of present day Brit comics some of which you may be familiar with (Ricky Gervais in The Office, Steve Coogan in Alan Partridge). So for me to see Simon Pegg make it onto the bigscreen in a film that is basically 'his' was a real joy.

Not that it matters at all, but to those who are interested, Simon Pegg had his own Sitcom here in the UK called 'Spaced' , where he basically plays a pretty useless stoner who draws comic art for a living but doesnt really have a proper job and has a collection of absurd housemates and it follows their random adventures. Also starring in the series was Nick Frost (Ed) as a military obsessive housemate/best friend, and Daisy, who also plays a small part in the film. This was a great series, that picked up a very cult following (being on the UK's Channel 4, the mother of all Cult channels here). If you enjoyed this film and Simon Pegg's humour, and the great dialogue and banter between him and Nick, then you should look this up!

Anyway im rambling. What i loved about this film is exactly what i loved about the series Spaced. It's the hidden jokes, its the little gems that he has left in there, quotes and homages to films he clearly loves - many of which are soundbytes me and my friends use quite often . For example when Shaun climbs out the sunroof of the Jag and Nick says 'watch the leather man' - dazed and confused! love it

I haven't seen the US edit, im just going to assume its the same - i can see why some of this film might have confused people, but really the accents in this film are pretty much London based entirely, very few people have any harsh regional accent that would throw people out. Given, some things are specific to the UK market like people on here have mentioned (some of the TV shows, the news presenters, the little mention of the woeful, hideous daytime TV program 'Trisha' that is famously watched by hungover and binged out students) but for the mostpart its pretty easy to get all the lines.

Another great piece of work was the 'doppelgangers'. That group of people that represent each of Shauns group like for like. Each of them are also in Sitcoms (little Britain, The league of Gentlemen) or have been along side Pegg in other stuff.

As for the high swear count, we are a pretty foul mouthed nation believe it or not, so i guess i didn't even think about that. The use of the 'C' word was so funny i choked on my drink anyway :)

This movie is a much better zombie movie than that remake of Dawn of the Dead(horrible horrible how could they do Romero like that). Simon Pegg is great as the titled character Shaun whose life goes dull until the undead start coming. Though a comedy this film does have some dramatic points, one includes a spoof of a classic scene from Reservoir Dogs. Nick Frost is really funny as Shaun's friend Ed and the soundtrack is great and has alot of funny moments in it. Romero loved this film so much he asked Pegg and director Edgar Wright to appear in his new film Land of the Dead as zombies. I haven't seen it but heard good things about it so I will get it when it comes out. Until then I will enjoy this good zombie movie. Highly Highly Recommended.",1123372800,3,885,4.3053892215568865

Granted, we all have our opinions, but if a person is interested in good comedy or crafted zombie films I would not suggest this nonsense. With comedy, their is a difference between funny and stupid, the movie is the latter. As a zombie film, their is no real horror felt, just ugly faces and some splattered about fake blood. Horror and comedy can work together, but not in this concoction. The film may have played better in England, but a good British movie works anywhere. Humor can be a matter of taste, I have to concede that. Watch and snore.",1123027200,12,628,4.517543859649122

It felt like being the butt of an unkind joke, like being served chocolates laced with Ex-lax.

The Plot-Shaun(simon pegg) is a slacker, he's lazy, uninspired, and again a slacker(you know something like you, yeah you who's reading this, hehehe i keed i keed) who has a failing relationship with his girlfriend. He also has a buddy named ED who he plays video games with and mixes records and listens to techno music with .But then weird things start to happen in London. News flashes across screens, people acting very wild, un-controlled, rabid, vile, demented. And you know what???Shaun doesn't notice a damn thing, it's take a zombie girl to be in his backyard who gets hit by a shovel for him to realize whats going on.
Shaun then has a dilemma at hand, does he stay home and play video games with ED or does he become a man, grab his crickit paddle and go across town and try to rescue his parents and friends from the zombie infested city?He chooses choice B and the fun begins.

Now i know what you're thinking........ your thinking i am such a great reviewer yeah i know, oh okay i know what you're thinking about this movie, that this is just another zombie spoof film..well partner your wrong, dead wrong now go in the corner you have a 5 minute timeout. Go i am serious!!!!!!!
okay well this is a smart comedy, some jokes you're gonna miss because some part of the comedy happens in the backround.
What is so good about this movie is this movie turns from a light hearted comedy to a full fledged horror film towards the end and you actually feel suspense and horror from a movie you thought was going to be a dumb spoof.
Yes my friend you must see this movie, it's an actual good movie from the U.K not just tasteless humour like ALI G.
(watch now the hatemail flow to my email account from U.K people).

The Negatives-yes even a great film like this has some negatives. Since this movie is british some phrases and dialouge can be rather hard to understand. But dont't worry it only occurs a few times during the movie, your film experience will not be ruined.

Pros
+Good humour
+great characters(except the stiff that looks like a grown harry potter)
+When the horror is on! the horror is on!
+yummmm internal organs fly everywhere, always a plus!

Cons
-hard to understand dialouge at times

Conclusion
I suggest you see this movie because THE OPINIONATED ONE SAID SO!!!!!!!!!!!plus it's really good.

""shaun of the dead"" is yet another comedy, homage/parody of romero's movies. it's more talkie, wittier and less gory than ""dead alive"". they are about equally funny. unfortunately  comedy/parodies of ""night of the living dead"" are by now (40 years later) almost totally played out and way too obvious. more serious and original new takes on this same material like ""28 days later"" and the ""dawn of the dead"" remake are much better and are highly recommened  instead of ""shaun of the dead"" (or ""dead alive"" for that matter). i'm adding 1 star for the very effective comedy before the zombies show up.",1122249600,3,932,4.81875

I won't go over the plot again as I'm sure you've read about the movie from all these other comments. I'll just say it one more time, Buy this DVD! The comedy is superb, The horror is genuinely frightening, the emotion is touching and real - all at the same time.

Some of the jokes were hard to understand since I'm an American and don't watch much British humor but not enough to take away from this great movie.",1121817600,2,412,4.098765432098766
2106491,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead combines British humor with zombie gore, as a slacker goes on with his routine of a life, unknowing that the entire world is being taken over by walking dead....

Shauns [Simon Pegg] life is so routine he nearly sleepwalks to the nearest grocery store in the morning, not knowing that there are just a few odd people stumbling and moaning after him. Thats just one of the things that make ""Shaun of the Dead"" so funny, these guys don't have a clue as to whats going on.

When Shaun and his friend Ed [Nick Frost] realize that everyone is running for their lives they do the only thing they know that can save them; Take out the bad music records in their collection of records and use them as frisbees to fend off the walking dead.

What makes this brilliant is that even though they want to survive, Shaun just cant seem to want to part with his favorite records. But everyonce in a while he manages to part with one, ""The Batman soundtrack? Chuck it....""

 When they realize that the frisbee idea might not work they resort to getting down and dirty with a shovel and a cricket bat as clubs.

The acting and humor in ""Shaun of the Dead"" is very entertaining and even sincere in some places. Anyone who's seen it should notice how dark the movie gets in the last half hour, going from fun, suspensful times as the people who are still alive are running away from the zombies, to, ""You know, they just might not make it...""

Not only does Shaun have to survive zombies, he also has to get his girlfriend to forgive him for not turning his life around, and also has to look out for his mother, who's husband just happened to have been bitten by a zombie. So many twists and funy moments, too many to name...

One of them though that needs mentioning is how Ed and Shaun go over in their minds on who to save and where to go as long as they know where the exits are and where they can smoke. The answer? The winchester pub that they always go to, and ironically the place where Shaun's girlfriend despises to go.

That is just some of the things that you can expect from ""Shaun of the Dead,"" A bunch of slackers actually thinking on their feet for a change, running around in a room mate's car that they stole after the room mate turns into a zombie himself, to impersonating chimpanzees in the Winchester pub.

I definately reccomend this movie if anyone wants a good laugh....",1121731200,4,2394,4.359550561797753
2106492,4,B0002MJT0I,"If you are a fan of The Newsroom, The Office or John Cleese's Clockwise, then you are the sort of person who should enjoy the dry British humor of this film gem.

Shaun is an uninspired stiff.  He likes his beer, his music, his friends, his girl and his pub.  This is not enough for his girl so she calls it quits.  But while this is going on we see small flashes that all is not right in the world.  The dead are starting to walk and civilization is falling.  Most of this is lost on Shaun and his obnoxious roommate until they find a zombie in their back yard.  After finally paying some attention to the news channels Shaun comes up with a plan.

Armed with a cricket bat Shaun is going to rescue his mother, his girl, and hole up in his pub.  Suddenly Shaun is motivated although his old self keeps showing through.

I won't tell you were his plan and battles lead as that is part of the fun of this movie.  But remember that this is a zombie flick so there is some gore (one scene in particular).  But unlike the Films of Romero and imitators the zombies are not central, Shaun is.

I found the cast to be strong and well chosen.  Acting was pretty solid and better than most horror, and probably all zombie, films.  The humor was good (if you like the dry style) and I particularly liked they way the coming menace was hinted at in the beginning.  A very good film.

2106493,4,B0002MJT0I,"As has been noted, SHAUN OF THE DEAD ( R Rated version) is a parody. It works well because it just satirises the genre in detail. Shaun is in every scene except one, and he is the driving force behind this film in terms of characters( His commentary work, he appears on both tracks) is nothing short of great, and as one of the co-writers he basically knows what he wants.
Crafted in a way that only a few British writers can do, the symmetry, and the irony, works well, in fact extremly well in a british context, but may not translate 100%  .... see the deleted scenes, other bits, and hear the main commentary for details on what happened there.
So much thought went into the writing alone of this film, that the commentary does not do it justice; especially things like ""FOREE ELECTRONICS"" where Shaun works, and the scene  where Dylan ""Dies"", all  have echoes, or are dead ripoffs of George Romero's work( And Very Specifically of the genius of Tom Savini's groundbreaking makeup work), as well as the general makeup work in DAWN OF THE DEAD ( Original  Romero version)[ and a very nice reference to ""Budd"" the Zombie ].

say it was a real underachiever... Why? I can

understand the movie didn't have a deep plot

mediocre to say the least.

The lead guy was ok and the overweight dude

was ok, but the rest of the cast was one of

the worst I had ever seen. None of the other

guys brought anything to the table. They

acted very poorly and I was hoping all of

them would die. Not any of them were the

slightest bit funny. It's about like having

sex with a woman that just lays there and

doesn't even have any good emotion. That's

what the rest of the cast was.

I can't help but think had this been done

sorta like Scary Movie it might have made

more funny. Nothing againest Brits, but I

even misunderstood alot of the jokes be-

cause of the accents the guys in the movie

had and that ruins the experience.

The movie had chances to be funny and it

totally missed the mark. The gore was good

and the acting was decent when you consider

what type of movie this is and some of the

zombies looked cool... It's ashame the lead

2106498,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is a British comedy that represents a spoof of the now popular zombie-movie genre that has movies coming into release quicker than you can say ""Zombie Nation."" Although it pokes fun of movies such as ""28 Days Later"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Day of the Dead"", it does so while still trying to be a horror movie. Well, kind of. For the definite fact is, this is ultimately a comedy through and through.

Shaun lives in London in his humdrum world and his slacker, slob-of-a-roommate, Ed. Shaun has been experiencing some friction with his girlfriend because of his less-than-appealing style of living. Shaun's other roommate wants Ed out, but Shaun is reluctant to do anything about it, especially since he likes to watch television and go to the pub and drink as much as Ed does. While trying to patch things up with his girlfriend and getting his mind off his doldrums Ed and Shaun realize that the people who are stumbling around London are not in fact drunk, but rather ZOMBIES! They must make a plan to stop the influx of man-eating stumbling zombies that are packing the city, but all time, make sure they get some television in all the while. Shaun must also try to save his mother and girlfriend from the fate of the flesh-eating creatures.

When I first saw the previews for this movie I was reluctant to want to watch it. It seemed like some lame comedy that would bring forth few if any laughs. I was very impressed, however, and this movie was much more than I could have anticipated. For one thing, this is not a movie that beats you over the head (pardon the expression, as the characters do beat the zombies over the head, but not my point) with laughs, but rather makes slight jokes at the expense of the horror-style genre. For instance, when Shaun and Ed first are encountered with the zombies approaching their home, they try to kill them using the sharp part of the Shaun's record album collection. However, rather than just flinging them at the zombies, they go through each one to make sure it is not one of Shaun's favorites. Awhile later, they are calmly having a discussion as they are pounding zombies with shovels.

As one reviewer noted, the latter part of the movie is probably the part that drags a little and is not quite as humorous. Still, I felt like the movie was fun, and definitely a ""popcorn"" style movie (if you can keep your stomach that is). If you enjoy a good spoof, and especially if you are up with the zombie-movie flicks, this is one you should definitely try out.

Witty, smart, funny and clever all around. Only in this movie can you see records being used as weapons and a zombie adding vocals to a song. I am very happy with the ending they chose. I haven't seen a movie with such a clever ending in a while.

I thought that the mix of comedy and the mix of ""horror"" went well. Before I watched it, I thought it was going to be more of a comedy than horror, and it was. However I'd say that the horror element they did use wasn't as censored as I thought it would be. There are deaths in the movie, there is blood and biting, etc.

This movie is just a parody of movies like ""Dawn Of The Dead"" ""Land Of The Living Dead"", etc. You start out with Shaun and his friend Ed living their lives and eventually Shaun has to deal with a breakup...after the breakup everything just unfolds.  It's like an equivalent of Scary Movie, but a different type of comedic effect. I know there are a lot of people who said that they don't get British comedy, and that they did not see as much humor as they thought they would have in SOTD.

2106504,4,B0002MJT0I,"Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a hilarious romp through the cliches of zombie movies, slackerdom, and romantic comedies.  Tossing the genres of horror and comedy into a blender and getting the mix just right, ""Shaun"" is one of those movies that earns the compliment, ""destined to be a cult classic.""

The titular Shaun (Simon Pegg) has an intriguing ambition -- for nothing to change whatsoever.  The outset of the movie sees Shaun's ambition being challenged, as reality checks in to tell him that he's not doing all that well.  29 years old and in a job he can't muster up the passion for to hate (mid-management at an electronics store), Shaun also learns that his wonderful girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) wants him to grow up, or else.  And his responsible flatmate wants him to kick out his slacker roomie, Ed (Nick Frost, in a hilarious performance) due to his flatulence and his inability to even make money dealing drugs.

Single, rejected and dejected, Shaun retreats to the only place in the world that makes sense -- his home away from home, the pub entitled ""the Winchester.""  On the way home, Shaun and Ed nearly bump into several staggering drunks . . . or are they drunks?  One of the most hilarious running gags in the movie is the amazing ability of our hero to fail to realize that London is beset by zombies!  A long, uncut scene of Shaun walking to the corner market for a morning beverage, nearly running into the arms of about fifteen zombies, is a masterpiece.

But soon, even our dense hero realizes that strange things are afoot.  Ed and Shaun come face to face with a few zombies, and quickly learn the basic rules of fighting the undead.  First, the undead are rather slow (""Shaun"" has several hilarious lines of dialogue as humans bicker over trivial matters while the undead shamble ever-so-slowly towards them -- well, maybe not trivia -- if you're going to use your record collection as zombie-decapitating missiles, wouldn't you start with Sade and save the New Order?).  Second, the head is the only really vulnerable spot.  Third, don't let them bite you, under any circumstances.

Ed and Shaun are assembling the stereotypical rag-tag bunch of supporting characters, including Liz, a couple of friends with hidden agendas, and Shaun's beloved mom and hated step-dad.  As you can expect, some of these characters are more or less expendable.  ""Shaun"" has some yucks with these cliches as well -- watch for a hilarious scene as one rag-tag bunch of survivors runs into another mirror-image rag-tag bunch of survivors heading in the opposite direction.

Shaun leads his troupe to the only bastion of common sense and reality left in his world - the beloved Winchester.  The flight to the pub and the defense of the pub give the filmmakers several great opportunities for humor and scares, and they get high marks for both.  A brief epilogue is both hilarious and somewhat poignant, as one is shown the true value of a friendship that can survive even the biggest obstacles.

We are going through a strange revival of the zombie movie these days.  From George Romero's new ""Land of the Dead"" to the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" to ""28 Days Later"" on the more traditional front to ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" on the humorous side, we've never seen more pure ""zombie flicks"" at one time on the big screen, as far as I can tell.  ""Shaun"" both sends up and honors the cliches of the zombie sub-genre of horror film, and it does so in wonderful style.  Both scary and hilarious -- listen for the perfect example of a witty soundtrack -- ""Shaun"" is a must-see for horror fans and for fans of British comedy.

While the DVD extras on ""Shaun"" are good, the movie is the reason to get this DVD.",1119830400,,3710,4.688271604938271
2106505,3,B0002MJT0I,"So what would happen if you replaced the hero of a zombie movie with a bubbling slacker?  Well if you are British, you get Shaun of the Dead.  The movie starts out following Shaun around his mundane life.  He's still working at a computer store.  He still sits in front of the TV flipping channels with his buddy Ed, who is a bigger loser than Shaun is.  But his world comes crashing down when his girlfriend dumps him.  Oh and the whole city is being turned into zombies, not that Shaun or Ed even notice.  That's until Ed notices a weird girl hanging out in their garden.  This gives Shaun the idea on how to get his girlfriend back, sweep her off her feet and take her to safety.  But Shaun and Ed are no Will Smith and Bruce Willis so hilarity ensues.

The major problem with the movie is that their too many spots in the movie where the scenes are not funny or scary.  With a movie that mixes humor with gore, there should be a least one going on at all time.  Another problem with the movie is that there is some things that are lost in the translation as it is a British film.  While I was watching it, I wondered out load, ""Why would Shaun have a paddle in his shed and why would he grab that?""  Someone then pointed out that it was a cricket bat.  And there were a few places where the British slang just went over of my head.

The DVD extras include the usual trailer, documentaries (extremely boring), deleted and extended scenes (good choice taking these out), and blooper reel.  One very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story.  No if only every movie did this.  Also, during the film, Shaun and Ed flip through the TV pretty quickly, so in the extra they show extended versions of what they flipped past including a interview with Coldplay who lost some of their members to the zombies and what looks to be the British version of Jerry Springer.

And in hopes to rejuvenate his career, Michael Jackson will don the Thriller makeup one more time to be the head zombie that leads the other zombie in a zombie dance.  Just make sure Shawn grabs a baseball bat out of the shed.",1119744000,,2449,4.348017621145375
2106506,4,B0002MJT0I,"I had heard of this movie from various people, but had seen very little in the way of publicity. So, I knew that it was a comedy - the title alone gives that away.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie - I have only watched it once. I found the relationships between the characters to be convincing, and likeable, and the characters themselves to be well portrayed. They aren't over the top as you might expect in an American movie - such as Evil Dead 2 or a Farrely Brothers movie. There's no doubt that they are templates or archetypes - the movie later alludes to this fact in what was both a rather obvious but stylishly brief scene. Still, the actors wear the characters well, and none of them feels exactly cliche, except for the effete boyfriend.

The humor is pretty fast. The movie doesn't spend a great deal of time telegraphing a joke, or hanging around after the punchline. Nor is it absurdist in the sense that it consists of non-sequitirs or visual puns. It copies the style used by Guy Richie in Snatch and others of fast cuts, such as the scene when Shaun and Ed are planning their course of action after they'e figured out that there's something funny going on.

The horror is mixed freely with the humor. Its pretty light horror. As zombies go, these are pretty typical. Slow, shambling, stupid, and apparently only inclined to attack people who don't act like zombies - they aren't the most terrifying creatures to be conceived of but their dead eyes and propensity for remaining alive once impaled does make them ghoulish. The fact that these are people the characters used to know is what makes it worse, and adds a bit to the horror.

The movie's final quarter is its weakest part. It's not bad at all, but it's a little heavy handed and corny compared to the far leaner and more clever first 3/4, which is my main reason for giving it a less than perfect review.",1119398400,2,1884,4.5
2106507,4,B0002MJT0I,"I'll admit, I love British comedies. Whether it's Monty Python or a Hugh Grant, it's just my genre. This movie is personal a 5-star, but because of my bias, I'm saying it's a 4 to everyone else. It's funny, because they're just normal people in a weird situation. If you like British comedy, you'll love this.

About the zed-word: You don't have to love zombie movies, I don't. I have a friend that does, but I'm more of 'a once you see one undead person, you've seen them all' type of person. What I liked was the fresh approach on an absurb topic. The movie looks at the humor behind putting a normal person in an abnormal situation. The zombies are just the choosen abnormal situation, it could have been aliens or vampires. The zombies do make it a bit gory so it's not for the faint.

All-in-all, I am glad that I received this and have it in my collection. It has repeat-watchablity.",1118707200,2,889,4.414634146341464
2106508,5,B0002MJT0I,"Its impossible not to love this movie. It has Zombies, romance, scares and even a tear or two. Its without a doubt the best movie to come out of the UK in the last five years.

Simon Pegg is wonderful as Shaun, the ultimate everyman with his sidekick Nick Frost as Ed. The rest of the cast are wonderful and a veritable whos who of British comedy, with Lucy Davis from the smash hit ""The Office"" and utterly fabulous Dylan Moran who is perhaps one of the greatest Irish standup comics ever.

The film was not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting a kind of typical spoof on all levels, with lots of ""in jokes"" for people who love Zombie movies. But that isn't what I got at all. It actually had a plot. A good one at that. You feel for these characters, especially Shaun who has to see more than a few of his loved ones fall prey to the flesh eating followers. I was choked up at the scenes with his mother and the goodbye to Ed in the cellar. There is genuine tension created with the character David, proving Dylan Morans wonderful range as a dramatic actor.  As a result this film has just as much credibilty, if not more, than the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead.

On the extras front, this is a perfect example of how to produce a real dvd. The wealth of commentaries (on the uk release) is wonderful. I love commentaries and loved the group one with all the principle characters together clearly enjoying each other company and, it would seem, getting a little drunk (at least on Dylans part)

I love this movie, mainly for the fact that it suprised me. It was wonderfully funny but also tugged at the heartstrings and had the odd scare here and there. A perfect movie.",1118448000,,1684,4.299684542586751
2106509,4,B0002MJT0I,"Let's get something straight.  This movie is not a parody, satire, or homage to zombie movies.  Any of those labels undercuts this entertaining film.  Just because a story has a healthy dose of humor that doesn't mean it should be dismissed as merely a comedy send up.  Shaun of the Dead is much more sophisticated that that.  Mostly.

The cleverness of this film is that it understands that zombie movies have been done to death, and that makes them predictable.  But the question is, if we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of one, how long would it take us to notice?  It takes Shaun quite a while, and when he does, he's like any of us.  Scared, confused, and more than a little incompetent, which leads to a lot of comic situations.

But this is not just a comedy.  People die.  Gruesomely.  Shaun experiences real loss.  And the best and worst of people is explored in a way that is often seen in zombie movies but still somehow seems fresh and interesting in this one.

The only weak spot is the end, which is a bit jokey and in my opinion, just a step out of tune with the rest of the film.  But it's still kind of funny, and a small sin.  So enjoy this film.  But please don't dismiss it if it causes you to chuckle now and then.",1118275200,2,1243,4.2844827586206895
2106510,4,B0002MJT0I,"""Shaun"" is a great movie that shows what a zombie attack would be like in real life. Imagine your life going down the drain; girlfriend breaks up with you, your step dad hates you, a pen in your shirt is leaking, and the last thing you need are zombies. At first, Shaun and his friends don't even think they are zombies, but just drunks. They soon discover how wrong they are.

At moments, the movie is very touching and at moments very sad, even some scenes that bring you to tears. And at other moments, funny as all get out! This movie is good at being serious when it wants to be and funny when it wants to be.

The only disappointment I had with this movie is the ending; a little dumb that kind of killed the entire point of the movie. I know the ending was supposed to be funny/scary, take it anyway you want, but it made you wonder why so many had to die if that's what happened at the end. Watch it find out what I'm talking about.",1117670400,,940,4.131147540983607
2106511,4,B0002MJT0I,"It's not that flat-mates Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are clueless. They are. You just can't blame them for not noticing their neighborhood has been overrun with zombies. As Shaun of the Dead begins, it's difficult to tell the living from the living dead. We watch as people trudge through their everyday lives, so systematically beaten down they look and walk like zombies.

Irreverent, sly, and affectionately connected to its source material, Shaun of the Dead is a love story with bite. The gory story is grounded by a good natured sense of humor and a real desire to make a horror film that goes against the grain. Splatter fans will appreciate the rip and shred effects, but at the heart of the film is a love story.

Pegg is the perfect anti-hero, a man child who shares a flat with two school chums, one a responsible albeit anal-retentive gatherer and harvester; and Ed, a slob who plays video games all day. Ed gets by doing miscellaneous jobs, while Shaun feels out of place as the senior sales manager at an electronics store. When they're not getting by, they're getting drunk at the Winchester Pub.

It's there that Shaun decides to move forward on his relationship with Liz (Kate Ashfield), a woman tired of his empty promises. Their future hangs on an important dinner date that Shaun naturally forgets. Shaun is so distracted over the break-up he doesn't realize the severity of another problem: the city is being overrun with the living dead.

Shaun and Ed's clueless behavior is good for several laughs: they mock a zombie on the street, believing he's drunk, and a female zombie who winds up in their backyard. Once Shaun and Ed are up to speed, they become reluctant zombie fighters, roaming the city to save the people they love. That includes Shaun's mother and stepfather, who doesn't believe that a little bite could lead to anything serious.

By design, we're not supposed to take any of Shaun of the Dead seriously. Indeed, characters are put in situations of grave danger, but the set-ups and pay-offs are so rich in black humor that we find ourselves engaged in the film's excesses rather than turning away.

What elevates the film is its sense of purpose. The filmmakers aren't just content with stocking the story with nameless and faceless zombie happy meals, they give the characters and thus the story a support system that can withstand anything they throw at it. Most horror films attempt to break the ice with nervous laughter, but Shaun of the Dead celebrates its silliness.

The film is decidedly British, and American audiences might have difficulty discerning some of the dialects and phraseology. The situations and jokes are universal, especially when the character's survival skills kick in. Shaun and Ed may not be great warriors, but they're great entertainment.

Director/co-writer Edgar Wright and star/co-writer Pegg take their cue from the works of Dario Argento and George Romero, and even Danny Boyle's recent 28 Days Later. The references should delight fans of zombie films, who will immediately recognize the homages. The performances are perfectly suited to the misfit nature of the story, with Pegg and Frost the biggest misfits in the bunch.",1117584000,2,3209,4.918669131238447
2106512,5,B0002MJT0I,"People are coming back from the dead!  They're killing in the streets, in the alleyways, in the lawns!  But all Shaun cares about his his romance troubles--his girlfriend is breaking up with him.  And when he finally gets attacked by the zombies, he and his slacker roommate decide that they must save her--and Shaun's mother (though they seem delighted at the prospect of killing Shaun's step-father).  What ensues is horrifying, scary, shocking--and absolutely hilarious.

This movie is extremely well acted; it's been a long time since I've seen this good of comic-timing in a movie.  And it's also disturbing and even scary; I shivered several times, and was on the edge of my seat the entire 90+ minutes.  And I was laughing the whole time; it's unusual, to be scared and laughing at the same time.

There's also a bonus aspect of this movie: it serves as a great social commentary.  Lots can be said about the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, as Shaun ambles about the city, oblivious of the world slowly falling apart around him; and then, when he is forced to face the zombies, how he insists upon dealing with mundane things...for example, when he hits a man with his car, he backs up to see if the man is alright.  When the guy turns out to be a zombie, Shaun sighs and says, ""Well, that's alright then.""

Hilarious.  ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of those flicks you can watch again and again, because it's that good.  Superb acting, clever writing, an intriguing plot, and genuine laughs and thrills...lots of movies aspire to be like this (and lots are accidently), but ""Shaun of the Dead"" sets the bar.",1117584000,2,1625,4.659649122807018

2106514,5,B0002MJT0I,"Horror films, and particularly the zombie movie, are often the site of young filmmakers first chance to make a 'real' movie.  Following in this tradition, Pegg, Wright, et al. have produced a film so lovingly packed with references to their heroes (who themselves often started with allusion laden genre films) that it is impossible not to get swept up in the enthusiasm.

This reveling in the history of genre films themselves is one sort of youthful excess, a thankful antidote to the transgressive, angry Beavis and Butthead style excess that characterized first-time director Zack Snyder's heartless ""Dawn of the Dead Remake.""  Pegg and Wright love talking about movies the way great novelists love talking about books and it shows throughout ""Shaun.""

That said, the scripting is so deft that it's hard to say once and for all if this is a zombie movie with a romantic comedy glued on top, or a romantic comedy with Zombies stapled on.  Part of this is because the film is as much about London as it is about scares.  The drab, listless lifestyles of early thirty-something Londoners is so much a part of the story that it can be enjoyed as much as a movie about a place and time (England in the dreary nineties) as about a group of characters (the standard rom-com archetypes: hapless boyfriend, impatient girlfriend, obnoxious best friend, ancillary 'married couple', etc.).  That the film can be enjoyed by 'blokes' and their girlfriends equally and for completely different reasons tells of just how lucky fans of genre films are to be visited by this crew, even if it's just this once.

The performances are all stellar.  There is not a line delivered by Bill Nighy or Dylan Moran that is not dripping with the sort of drollery usually reserved for Mankiewicz dialog.  Pegg displays the most lovable sort of spastic-faced English comic delivery and Nick Frost is the most adorable galut I've seen on film in a long time.  Even the extras and one-line performers are pitch perfect, credit casting or directing or both.

The soundtrack is an amazing array of remixes touching on Zombie film lore, eighties electro notalgia, video game scores, and indy consciousness.

This is as much of a must see for fans of horror films as Stephen Chow's ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is for fans of marital arts movies, or as ""Imitation of Life"" is for fans of melodrama.  It's so good, in fact, that by the end it becomes a homage to itself.",1116633600,2,2424,4.781774580335731

It appears to be the type of movie that aims to appeal to ""mature"" audiences but instead seems to be capable of impressing only 5-year old kids with obtrusive swearing and cheesy zombie action.

Of course it is a horror movie if listening to people covered in cheezy fake blood groan constantly sends chills down your spine.

2106517,5,B0002MJT0I,"This is a killer movie. It is the first really fresh farce I've seen since the ""Airplane""/""Naked Gun"" continuum of cookie cutter comedies started to run in the early 1980's. The movie is well photographed, smart, clever and funny. The humor is a little goofy (imagine if your high school class clown were allowed the budget and resources to make a serious movie), but it is satisfying.

There are many current movies that had bigger budgets and can only wish they were as well made and well scripted as ""Shawn of the Dead.""

The filmmaker is well versed in traditional zombie movie/""Night of the Living Dead"" cinematic mythology, and you'll see a lot of familiar horror movie symbols skewered.

It pains me to say that this movie probably couldn't be made by Americans today (the cast and writers are relentlessly British) because of Hollywood's fear of original and clever thinking. The tradition of British humor which prides itself on originality of thinking is a key element at work in the success of ""Shawn of the Dead."" Of course Hollywood will try to clone the film, but the product will look like all the rest of the recycled spew churned out by domestic filmmakers.

Take note Anglophobes: there's nothing in this movie except the accents you won't approve of. In fact, there's little in the film that won't make perfect cultural sense. This is the kind of slacker movie that every Twixster living in his mom's basement from Shepherd's Bush to Malibu dreams of making. It's surely the movie they want to watch.

Best of all, since my family purchased the film we've watched it several times. There's always something new to see. This is critical in a film that you will purchase for your own collection.

WARNING: As I said, this is a smart movie! Like all of the best comedy there are some barbed social comments at work here. You've probably thought the film's main theme yourself: in the modern technological world if we aren't careful, we all wind up ""living dead"" zombies.

If you can't deal with a film that rises well above the profanity and bathroom humor of ""Scary Movie"" you won't like ""Shawn of the Dead,"" but if you need some real humor that's a step or two above the drivel you put up with at the cinema day in and day out, check out ""Shawn of the Dead.""",1116115200,,2276,4.632754342431761

2106519,5,B0002MJT0I,"Who knew that such a successful spoof on the zombie movies would come from England? The film has its share of gore, including one very gory scene while it still has its laughs. Pretty short intro mind you.

Shaun is basically a slacker. He works at an electronics store, isn't really all that ambitious, and his idea of taking his girlfriend out revolves around taking her to the Winchester, a local pub. He lives with Ed, a slacker worse than he is who plays Timesplitters 2(I think) and doesn't write down people's messages, only his own. There's also Pete, who can't stand Ed of course.

Shaun's girlfriend Liz ends up dumping him and noticing a lot of weird things happening around town. But once things due start to happen, he's completely oblivious like the bloody handprints in the store or a very empty street. That changes when a woman appears in their backyard. He pushes her onto a small pole and is impaled...only she stands right back up with a gaping hole in her stomach. Now it gets serious as he tries to fend off the zombies(he doesn't want them called that however) with his girlfriend, Ed, his mother, father-in-law, and Liz's 2 friends.

The comedy from the film mainly comes from subtleties or just plain ridiculousness without being off-the-wall. Realizing that zombies can be killed through beheading or massive brain trauma, they start flinging vinyls at them, only to end up singling out certain records because they're too good.

The acting is surprisingly strong too with a great scene involving a Reservoir Dogs spoof involving a mexican standoff. The gore is a bit subdued since you're not gonna find anything really really graphics, until near the end anyway.

Shaun of the Dead is lacking in comedic performances.

raised with a wry (or is that ""rye"") sense of humor to

the tune of Benny Hill and Monty Python.  I sojourned

over to Blockbuster to find SOTD and rushed home to place it im DVD player.  I just finished watching it.

FIVE!!!  This spoof on zombie flicks (""Dawn of the

Tarantino could appreciate it as much as I.  It is a

tongue-in-cheek (maybe tongue-in-ear) look at horrific

Zombie flicks.  I've never laughed more during a

horror romp than this...maybe equal to the ""Scary

a loser roommate, and is in the midst of losing his

Combining blood, guts and gore with cultural icons such as the cricket bat, the spade and undertones of understatement, I nearly choked to death on this one. I am still in some discomfort from laughing.

Simon Pegg is just a treat as Shaun, (the hero of the story), and his facial features, mannerisms and expressions caused more than a few discomforting muscular spasms and cramping. Nick Frost is also the perfect guy to play the slob best friend Ed. Their adventures in attempting to rescue Liz, (Shaun's ex-girlfriend), his Mum and her husband, along with Liz's friends, are hilarious.

One of the things I especially liked about this movie is the way in which the gore is not the only humour. In typical British style, the humour comes on a few different levels, and that provides some more interest. Situational humour figures big in this movie, for example with Shaun and Ed making an impromptu rap song with a zombie providing back-up groans was a highlight. The humour went from the simplistic to quite subtle in the same movie. It provided a depth that could be enjoyed by most people.

I thought it was a great movie, and was a lot of fun. There is something for everyone, though not for the faint hearted. It is pretty gory. However, the tissues would come in useful for the excruciating pain of watching this movie. I think I have permanently damaged my throat.

Originally released on the other side of the pond, this English horror-comedy seamlessly blends intense zombie terror and wry humor without ever coming off as forced or condescending.  Shaun of the Dead clearly has a lot of fun playing with horror movie conventions, especially those of (duh) zombie movies, and it does so in such a fast-paced manner, and with special effects that are so much more impressive than you'd expect to see in such a low-budgeted movie, that it's almost impossible not to enjoy it. Titles aside, there are a few thematic parallels to be found with Dawn of the Dead (largely the frequent shifts in tone), but this is not, I repeat, NOT a tribute, a parody, or anything else of that nature.  Shaun of the Dead is its own creation, one that takes Romero's Dead trilogy as its starting point but comes up with more than enough inspired ideas of its own.  It's billed as ""A smash hit romantic comedy...with zombies,"" and while that description isn't too far off, the movie actually encompasses a significantly broader range of styles.

It's rare for movies to work on this many levels, but Shaun of the Dead is such a great movie largely because it's so wide-ranging in tone: at its best, it perfectly encapsulates the combination of high comedy, horror, and drama that is everyday life, zombies or no zombies.  Indeed, the shambolic walking undead are just the latest in a series of troubles facing the movie's title character.  In fact, they come along at a somewhat opportune time in light of the catharses that Shaun faces in the early going, as the movie's first half-hour sees its 29-year-old protagonist facing something of an early mid-life crisis.  After all, when your girlfriend has just dumped you, you're stuck in a dead-end job at an electronics store, and your roommates are at each other's throats, there's nothing like an army of faceless zombies trying to (literally) tear you a new one to give you some perspective.  In this movie, the undead may intrude upon the world of the living, but that doesn't mean the trials of everyday life get put on hold.  If anything, they're magnified.  In that sense, aside from supplying the movie with some grisly frights and plenty of nasty gore, then, the zombies serve as a mighty fine plot device, enabling Shaun to find the assertiveness and determination he needs to get his life together while simultaneously handling the more mundane task of staying alive.  Much of the appeal of Shaun of the Dead actually comes from watching Shaun evolve from a confused, directionless underachiever into the decisive man of action that he is by film's end.

And of course, it doesnt hurt that the movie's incredibly watchable from beginning to end, and undeniably hilarious for much of that time as well.  Edgar Wright, who co-wrote the script with Pegg, directs the movie with a manic, stylish, and ruthless efficiency that keeps things moving briskly from one wildly entertaining set piece to another.  Slapstick humor effortlessly shares space with plenty of dry British wit, with several truly unforgettable scenes along the way: you've got Shaun and his best friend Ed fending off the advances of a zombie while thinking she's just drunk; Shaun and company trying to impersonate zombies long enough to make it through a crowd of them to safety; and a rollicking three-person zombie beatdown with pool cues set to the tune of Queen.  In the next breath, though, the movie can have you sweating, as there's plenty here for fans of blood and guts.  Heads explode, zombies get impaled, throats get bitten, and one poor guy gets torn to pieces while still very much alive.

As though the movie isn't enough, the DVD release contains tons of time-wasting extras to enhance the viewing experience.  As a whole the supplemental material provides all kinds of insight into the experience of making the movie, from Simon Pegg's video diary; to the flipboard Pegg and Wright used to sum up the plot; to special effects comparisons; to extended scenes laden with commentary.  Since the movie was made with a pretty small budget, it's interesting to see how the filmmakers had to work around monetary limitations while at the same time making a movie that steps outside of genre limitations.  Needless to say, you should pick up the widescreen edition if at all possible, as the picture quality on it is decidedly sweet, but whatever the case Shaun of the Dead is a movie that should not be missed.",1112832000,3,4633,4.839240506329114
2106531,5,B0002MJT0I,"I seriousely think that this is the most hilarious film of the year. One good thing about this movie, is that you do not have to watch the real ""Dawn of the Dead"" in order to actually enjoy the spoof, ""Shaun of the Dead.""

Storyline- The storyline of Shaun of the Dead is basically about a guy named Shaun and his friend who are practically fed up with life. He cant really be bothered to do anything along with his friend Ed. The only real fun they can entertain themselves with is either by playing video games or annoying the living daylights out of their roomate Pete.

When they find out that they're are zombies on the loose and everytime someone is bit by a zombie, h@ll breaks out for them. They cant think of a plan to get out of the situation and they end up like wild chickens with their heads popped off, mentally not literally. It is up to them to stop the Zombies and get out of town, fast.

What i liked about the storyline is that it is so simple and yet hilarious. Director Edgar Wright does a wonderful job of sticking to the story as well as every so often resorting to the real version ""Dawn of the Dead.""

Great job guys in terms of storyline!

Acting/script- The acting/script, i thought, was actually better then the real storyline. The words and phrases that each character comes out with are just priceless and another good thing about the characters is that each one has the same personality. This usually isn't good for movie, but when your talking about a spoof like this, its hilarious and great. The actors do a really great job on letting the world know that they are living a dull life and are just fed up with it. I really don't think that they could have chosen better actors to be honest for the role of Shaun, Ed and Pete once again because of their great emotions and acting skills! (Well at least in this movie their acting skills are great, i have to admit, i had never even heard of any of them before this movie came out:)

Once again, great job!

Other/conclusion- There really isn't that much more to the movie besides the hilarious lines, acting and the storyline. There isn't much action, nore special effects and it isn't really suspensful. I know your probobly thinking, then why go see it? But its the comedy that make this movie great and definetely worth seeing. If your one of those people who don't like characters cursing their heads off (which is one of the reasons why this movie is rated ""R"" besides SOME gruesome scenes), then you might want to stay away from it and not watch it, but now a days no one cares HOW much characters swear/curse in movies which is why i think the director added quite a few of those words in the movie, to show emotion and knowing that the audience won't really care.

In conclusion, if your up for a great killer comedy, this is definetely worth renting or even buying from your local movie retailer!",1112400000,,2887,4.413533834586466
2106532,5,B0002MJT0I,"Simon Pegg ( ""Spaced"", ""Hippies"" ) stars as Shaun in this black comedy/zombie gore-fest. After Shaun's girlfriend leaves him, he realises how miserable his life is and decides to change things around. Unfortunately, the dead have decided to roam to earth for a bit, devouring human flesh and what-not, which makes things tricky for him.

  ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a wonderfully written, well directed tribute to old zombie movies such as ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". And a tribute it is too, as opposed to an all-out spoof. The zombies act like real zombies, and the humour comes from the actors.

  The DVD itself is brilliant. It's packed with special features such as outtakes, deleted scenes, comics, featurettes and four different commentary tracks, all on one disc.

2106534,5,B0002MJT0I,"Mutilating zombies has never been funnier than in Shaun of the Dead. Taking a page from the Evil Dead franchise, this film provides plenty of blood, guts, and gut-busting comedy. But what's really brilliant about it is that it doesn't limit itself to comedy and zombie-killing, but also makes subtle commentary about real-life zombies: us.

The main character, as the title tells us, is, of course, Shaun (Simon Pegg), a 29-year-old slacker who works in an electronics store with a bunch of teenagers and spends his nights at the Winchester Tavern, getting drunk with his buddy Ed (Nick Frost), who is also crashing at his place, and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), whose patience with his general apathy is wearing thin.

One night, Shaun fails to make proper dinner plans, and Liz dumps him outright, so Shaun and Ed go to the Winchester yet again to drown their sorrows. The next morning, a severely hungover Shaun walks to a nearby convenience store in a trance, not even noticing the carnage around him that has been caused by the walking dead. When he gets back to his house, Shaun and Ed finally figure out that these pale-faced creatures are not, in fact, just drunk, but are actually deadly zombies, and so, after some failed attempts to dispel them by throwing bad records and other such household objects at them, Shaun takes up a cricket bat, and Ed a shovel, and the two of them start whacking zombies. Shaun comes up with a plan: (1) steal roommate Pete's car, (2) pick up Liz, (3) pick up Shaun's mom and kill his step-father who has been bitten by a zombie, (4) go to the Winchester, which is somehow secure, (5) ummm... wait until they go away? Okay, so it's not the best plan in the world, but nobody else seems to have any better ideas.

Shaun of the Dead successfully lampoons every bad zombie movie that was ever made, by taking the cliches from them and turning them on their heads. For example, when Shaun procures a shotgun and starts firing on the zombies, he can't hit any of them--of course he can't, he's never even touched a shotgun before! And the screenplay is smart: these characters react as people really would react; they don't immediately know all the answers and they don't come up with great plans for destroying them. They come up with bad plans and then have to figure out step by step what to do to keep from being bitten and becoming zombies themselves.

Writer-director Edgar Wright and his co-writer (and star of the film) Simon Pegg decide to take their time in the beginning of the film to establish the characters and their quirks, and this is an excellent strategy, because it sets up everything else that follows. When Simon's strategy is to set up camp at the Winchester, well of course it is, because we know that that's how he thinks. I laughed hysterically for nearly the entire length of the movie, especially so at the end when the fate of the zombies is revealed. It's the perfect ending to an excellent film.",1111968000,3,2969,4.638783269961977
2106535,4,B0002MJT0I,"If zombies are your bag, and you're looking for a good laugh at the same time, then this flick is for you.
The movie follows the standard zombie plot.  Hero gets up one day, does his usual thing, and suddenly everyone is a zombie and it is up to him to save the planet.  Only here, the catch is that Shaun is just your average everyday slacker in a dead-end job.  He doesn't have a chiseled figure and is filled with self doubts.  His best friend is disliked by many and is a slacker himself.  In other words, these aren't the guys you would expect to be leading a group of people to safety.
But this movie works.  Unlike other movies which focus on blood and gore, this movie focuses on humour.  The gore and violence is kept to minimum, with more of a focus spent on the interactions between Shaun, his girlfriend, and his slacker buddy.
This is most definitely a zombie movie for the Gen-X'ers amongst us.",1111881600,,908,4.337278106508876

2106537,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is one of the best homages to Horror films I've ever seen.  Hilarious, bloody, and extremely well written; Shaun of the Dead is executed with blistering gusto and loving affection for the Horror genre.  Tribute is given in particular to the films of George Romero (um, just look at the title folks) and Sam Raimi(extreme close-up/quickshot, shovel to the head, ""Ash is feeling a little bit under the weather"").

Shaun (played by Simon Pegg in one of 2004's breakout performances) is an affable loser, stuck in a dead end job with a lovelife on the rocks.  His only constant comforts are his unemployed couch potato/stoner friend Ed and drinks at his favorite pub, The Winchester.  After his girlfriend dumps him Shaun goes on an all night bender with Ed, never noticing the somewhat strange behavior some of the townsfolk are exhibiting.

The next morning Shaun wakes up to one hell of a hangover and a world overrun by the walking dead.  Although it takes him a while to realize it.  This movie is so good because so many scenes are executed with dead on brilliance and near perfect comic timing.  That's one thing the Brits will always have over us Yanks, they're damn funny people.

What follows is a harrowing and hilarious sequence of events as Shaun is suddenly thrust into the position of leader.  Whether he's using zombie mimicry as urban camouflage or wielding a cricket bat as a bludgeon, Shaun gets the job done.

Shaun of the Dead is an amazing film, a cult hit for the new millenia. Its uncanny blending of Horror affinity (with some quite resplendent gore) and romantic comedy is a bright, shining glimmer of hope for the Horror genre. So get your Horror loving friends together and sit back for one damn fine show.

P.S. The DVD is packed with tons of extras so make sure you check 'em out when you're done watching.",1111536000,4,1850,4.655384615384615
2106538,4,B0002MJT0I,"Strangely, I think that this is my first zombie movie, and it's one heck of a way to start.  This movie mixes horror with comedy very well, making it a solid comedic performance.

The story revolves around Shaun (Simon Pegg), a guy who's kind of going through the motions in life, like a zombie.  His best friend Ed (Nick Frost, who looks a lot like a fatter Weiss from Alias) is even more of a zombified slob, and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is at the end of her rope with Shaun.  Soon, however, things happen that make relationship troubles small potatoes.  The dead start to rise and try to kill the living.  One of the best things about this movie is that, for a while, no one notices!  One reason is the improbability of it all, but another one is that Shaun and Ed just think that the zombies are drunk, drugged, and tired (social commentary anyone?).  They soon figure out the truth, and the fun begins.

Shaun and Ed pick up Liz, some of her friends, and Shaun's mom (Penelope Winton), and head off to a local pub to hide out from the zombies.

The movie is, for the most part, full of laughs, although the ending does veer a little more toward the serious end of the spectrum (up until the priceless gag ending that I couldn't see coming).  However, this is British humor, so if that isn't appealing to you, avoid this movie.

2106542,2,B0002MJT0I,"I love zombie movies.  I don't know what it is about the living dead that is so appealing.  I was definitely looking forward to a film satirizing the zombie flick, namely Shaun of The Dead.  First of all, I'm not a big fan of satire films that use puns of the films they're poking fun at as their titles.  Whether it be Shaun of the Dead or Night of The Living Bread, it just comes across to in-your-face ""this is supposed to be funny"".
I enjoyed the first half or so of the Shaun of The Dead.  I thought the gags were funny, like the false alarms when you're thinking 'okay, this is when the dead start to walk' and it doesn't happen.  Then when it does start to happen, it's played off as something normal happening, until the very end of the scene.  The humour in the film was funny.  I didn't laugh out loud, but I enjoyed it.
It wasn't until the survivors make their way to their fortress/sanctuary, Shaun's favorite pub, that the film goes downhill for me.  It just gets too dark and depressing and very sad.  I just don't see the humor in killing someone you love or care about.  I know that part wasn't supposed to be humorous, but because its such a huge downer, the film doesn't recover.
I'd recommend renting this film first just to see if you like it.  But if you're expecting a hilarious, gut busting film from beginning to end, you might be disappointed.",1110585600,5,1368,4.32156862745098
2106543,5,B0002MJT0I,"You're twenty-something, at the crossroad in your life, maybe you hate your job or your relationship is in trouble...we've all been there.  But things don't really get grim until you throw the end of the world into the mix.  Which is exactly what happens to the eponymous Shaun of ""Shaun of the Dead"".  Every day is the same and his life is going nowhere, which is precisely what has gotten him dumped.  His college era friendships are looking a little long on the tooth, and he has no career to speak of.  Fortunately, a zombie plague is giving him the opportunity to show his true mettle.

What is perhaps most engaging about this film is that while it is a parody, with numerous flat out hilarious moments, it is also offers up some genuine thrills, a bit of romance and a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the strains and emotion of an end of the world type scenario.  The film begins simply enough with Shaun reeling through life, largely detached from the surrounding world.  Until one day his routine falls rather alarmingly apart when the urban zombies he encounters turn out to be actual zombies.

As Shaun and his ne'er do well pal Ed set out to rescue his mother and his girlfriend the directors do a nice job of whipsawing from parody to drama to horror and back again.  While ""Shaun of the Dead"" is first and foremost a comedy, it offers some surprisingly poignant moments, including Shaun's reconciliation with his badly mauled stepfather.  Of course, it offers the best fight sequence set to Queen since ""Highlander""; although this one doesn't involve swords, so don't take things to seriously.

What lends to the comedy, and also to the interesting dynamic, is that the cast is made up exclusively of normal people.  No cops, not even any security guards; no one with martial arts training, etc.  When Shaun's band finally gets their hands on a gun, none of them can hit a thing with it.  Moreover, they fight and backbite, and while Shaun does rise to the occasion, he is far from infallible.

The most interesting aspect of these relationships is that between Shaun and his recently ex-girlfriend Liz.  She dumps him because he was doing nothing with his life, but now that he's making a go of it, the circumstances hardly seem right.  The directors insert their give and take in to the flow of the action perfectly; their interaction is never out of context or over the top.  A such, it has more in common with old time Hollywood romances that it does with the over the top grope-fests one expects today, and the result is a certain sweetness that nicely offsets the rather grim setting.

Offering laugh out loud moments, a few nice chills and some really interesting social commentary, ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a surprisingly complex movie.  While it nicely lampoons just about every zombie film you've ever seen, it is hardly derivative.  Those who enjoyed Max Brooks' book ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" will particularly appreciate the film as much of the comedy is the subtle, tongue in cheek satire the British do so well.  That said, don't rule ""Shaun of the Dead"" out just because you're not a fan of the genre; it's one of the more unique films you're ever likely to see and a real treat.

What that last one means is that it has several self-references that you don't notice until you've watched it a few times.  It also refers to other zombie movies.  In the scene selection menu, one of the scenes is called ""Residential Evil"".  This is my favorite part of the movie, where Shaun walks from home to the store and back, NOT NOTICING the zombies around him!  The scene is funny and creepy at the same time.

Other references are to 28 Days Later (at the end of the movie) and, of course, Night of the Living Dead.  Use the Zomb-o-Meter if you know even less about zombie horror than I do.

The zombie theme is a running gag throughout the movie.  Many of the background characters look like zombies before the zombie plague reaches them!  An important moment is when Shaun removes his job nametag, thus rejecting literal and social zombification.

Pay attention to Ed, who represents Shaun's apathy.  As Shaun becomes more dynamic, Ed progresses from mere deadweight and becomes actively obstructive.

My only criticism of SotD is that David is presented one-dimensionally.  He shows no real motivation beyond opposing Shaun.

There is swearing, and one character gets his guts ripped out, but overall Shaun of the Dead is a good movie.  It's funny, scary, intelligent, well-paced, and well-acted.",1109808000,,1468,4.850806451612903

The dialogue is fantastic, and I don't know about everyone else, but some moments actually made me jump. It reminded me of the Scream films in this aspect. I could laugh my head off and be sort of scared at the same time.

Shaun's girfriend, Liz, breaks up with him because he does nothing. He plays video games, hangs out at the pub, and is unaware of what is happening around him, so much so that he wakes up one morning to find a zombie girl in his backyard and thinks she's just drunk. That is, until she tries to bite him, and he pushes her away and she falls onto a pole that goes through her stomach and she's still ""alive."" So weird. He decides that the best thing to do would be to go get his mom, his ex-girl, and go to the pub, which is of course, a safe place to hide. Yeah. Right. The ending had me laughing so hard I thought I would die. And actually, I began to think that if such zombies took over, this ending could be what could happen! Ha ha ha...

Anyway, I definitely recommend this movie. You may be a little unimpressed at first, but trust me, stick with this one. I almost quit watching it, and I'm so glad that I kept with it because I am so not disappointed in this movie! It's funny, kinda scary, campy-- everything that a REALLY GREAT SPOOF should have!",1109721600,,1455,4.119718309859155
2106550,4,B0002MJT0I,"It's not easy to send up a movie style that already rarely takes itself too seriously, but, with some great one-liners and visual gags, Shaun of the Dead succeeds most of the time as both an enjoyable spoof and as a fond tribute to the Romero-esque genre.

The characterisation is surprisingly strong and Shaun's (brilliantly played by Simon Pegg) tribulations and hang-ups will elicit nods of recognition from many of us I expect!

Some extremely laddish humour, interspersed with wry and often very perceptive observational comedy, ensures continued interest, and the action scenes are genuinely dramatic and effective.

Inspired (ironic) choice of soundtrack material too.

Huge amount of extras make this great value for money.

Not Oscar material maybe, but still a highly entertaining movie, which should appeal to those who enjoy the likes of the Evil Dead 2/3 and American Werewolf in London. Like those movies, Shaun of the Dead is almost certainly destined for similar cult status.",1109462400,,991,5.2075471698113205

2106552,5,B0002MJT0I,"I don't usually do too well with zombie flicks...I spend most of the movie with my coat over my face.  So I was torn when I first heard reviews of ""Shaun of the Dead"" because while it looked amusing, it still involved zombies.  I am so glad I overcame my queasiness and went to see it!

This is not a zombie movie, it's a poke at common culture that happens to have zombies in it.  As they say, the mark of a hero is how he reacts to adversity.  The focal point is NOT the destruction caused by the undead but rather what happens to our hero in the aftermath.  Because Shaun is a hero.  He is Everyman, from his penchant for drinking in his favorite pub to his ignorance of his girlfriend's wishes to his lack of enthusiasm over his job and quest for respect which will never come, right down to his incessant channel surfing which keeps him from catching wind of the growing panic outside his door.  That's where the comedy is rooted, in the places where the audience can laugh at themselves because they really see themselves onscreen.  And then there are some simply hilarious moments, such as the one outside the pub when Shaun and his roommate sing drunkenly and think they are being backed up by a fellow drinker who we know is merely a moaning zombie.  Brilliant.

The message here is a simple one and is clearly illustrated throughout the picture, most obviously in the opening sequence: What's the difference between these people who shuffle blindly through their days and the actual zombies? The movie is brilliant and funny and scary at points as well...Perfect.",1108857600,5,1573,4.542553191489362
2106553,3,B0002MJT0I,"There will be unintentional spoilers periodically.

I'm the type of person who doesn't read movie reviews before I watch the film. I don't seek out trailers online, or read the latest dish on upcoming releases. I prefer to go into a film with a clean slate, knowing as little as possible about the film before I see it. I find the movie going experience more enjoyable when I have less pre-conceived conceptions about the movie I'm about to watch. That being said, I love to read reviews and seek out trivia about movies that I have already seen. I am addicted to the Internet Movie Data Base's Trivia section. I enjoy reading other peoples thoughts and ideas about a movie and compare them to my own.

Since living in France I have completely been out of the entertainment loop. We don't have a TV and it is rare that we go to a new movie. I do visit a few web sites to keep up with the news and hear bits and pieces of the movies that are coming and out and generating some buzz. Shaun of the Dead is a film that I have been hearing buzz about for several months. I refused to read any reviews or really research any aspect of the movie, but I couldn't help but hear bits and pieces of good things about. Primarily that it was a funny zombie spoof. Being a fan of the zombie genre, when the chance came up to borrow the dvd, I didn't hesitate to take it.

The plot is the pretty standard zombie plot. Some type of radiation/virus wreaks havoc on the earth re-animating the dead into brainless, homicidal maniacs. The movie does a good job of spoofing many of the conventions of the genre. The title character, Shaun, is so stuck in his hum drum existence it takes him a couple of days to realize that his city has been attacked by zombies. He has a dead end job, his girlfriend just broke up with him, and his flat mates are constantly fighting. Despite their being several zombies eating human flesh around him and the constant media blitz about them, it literally takes a zombie in his back yard for Sean to notice. There are a number of truly funny scenes that mimic many of the classic zombie cliche's.

Here, the zombies walk in the classic, slow motion, brain dead way. They are mockingishly slow. In one scene Sean and his friend, Ed, throw a large crate full of junk at two zombies, then have time to run for a crate of records and argue which records are crappy enough to launch. The entire time the zombies are slowly walking towards them to devour Sean and his friend. Other scenes have one zombie being beaten with pool sticks repeatedly to little or no effect. Time and time again there are little digs at the genre conventions while still lovingly following them.

A quick perusal of IMDB's list of trivia for this film will show plenty of references to nearly every zombie film imaginable. I consider myself a fan of zombie films, but these guys must be nuts about them. They've set up multiple scenes that are exact homage to older films. They've lifted lines right out of the classics of the genre. I must say that while reading the list I became more impressed with what the filmmakers created with this picture, but while watching it most of the references went over my head. As I said, I like zombie movies. They're gorey, violent, bloody and often hilarious (intentional or otherwise). I have seen more than my fair share of good and awful zombie flicks. Yet here, most of the references were naught caught by me. I can't exactly fault a film for referencing so many other films, yet I have to wonder who but the diehard zombie fanatic caught them.

My biggest complaint with the film is that it is too comedic, without being funny enough. What I mean by that is that the production is made like a comedy. The actors play their parts as if they are in a comedy and not the horrible zombie addled situation that is scripted. Sure, there are a few moments of anguished screaming and fear, but those are over acted and far between. The story is truly frightening, the dead of came to life and are devouring the city. This is not a light hearted romp. Though often quite funny, zombie films play the situation straight. I felt let down that everyone was playing the situation for gags and not allowing the comedy to be more organic, or to flow out of the conventions of the genre itself. In the end I didn't find the movie funny enough for all that. It was played for humor all the way through, yet I wasn't laughing nearly enough. Some of this comes from not getting all the ""in"" jokes. Some of this is also, likely enough, because it is a British comedy at heart. There are a number of bits that seem to play better for the British sensibilities than my American in France heart. There were several moments that I could see the joke play out and ""get"" it, but it wasn't enough to really make me laugh. This is not to say the movie isn't funny. Because it is, often hilarious even. It's just that the tone of the film was of great comedy, and the buzz I had heard matched this. Yet while watching it, I didn't find it as funny as expected.

While thinking about this review I began to wonder how I would make a zombie spoof better. It wouldn't be right to go the Zucker brothers way. I got over that type of comedy in junior high, and the genre (well the horror genre which zombie movies are a sub-genre of) has been spoofed in this way enough (see Scary Movie). Slap stick spoofs were perfected by Sam Raimi in the Evil Dead series. In the end I decided that what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film is exactly the way to do it. I just think they missed the mark a little. I think I was partially disappointed because the genre itself has produced enough unintentional humor. Zombie movies are so often insanely bad, they are great fun. It is difficult to spoof a convention when the convention itself is so awful it seems a spoof unto itself. Likewise some of the conventions such as the ineptness and slow walk of the zombies has been revamped by the likes of Danny Boyle. Instead, here, I would have preferred a darker, bloodier movie. I don't believe this would have hurt the comedy. The references and homages could have stayed in tact and comedy could come out of horrific situations.

Shaun of the Dead is a fine movie. It spoofs a genre of film that is dear to my heart, yet remains firmly a fan of the genre. It references so many of the classics and non classics of the genre that you'll need encyclopedic knowledge of zombies to catch them all. It is truly funny and makes a great party movie. Where it fails, it fails as a zombie movie. It is made for jokes and not scares, and there it falls a little flat for a good spoof. But certainly worth the price of the rental.",1108771200,4,6714,4.3785084202085

2106556,4,B0002MJT0I,"This is a product of the ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, so who cares what genre it falls under? This fun flick is a spoof on zombie films in general, and like most zombie films, has some pretty well thought out social commentary embedded into it.

The dry British humor is there, as well as the Western influence. A loyal, good-hearted appliance store manager, whose life consists of playing video games, downing pints, and trying to keep his girlfriend happy is the center. A plague spreads, and soon most of the world has become zombified...it is time for Shaun to step up, save his friends and take charge of his otherwise pathetic life.

Maybe I liked this because I could relate to Shaun. My wife said he reminded her of me, an underachiever (was she ripping on herself, then?). Like many male icons before him- the three stooges, Rodney Dangerfield, and Homer Simpson...there is something about Shaun that should strike a chord in most average men (not that Shaun is a ""male icon,' but you know what I'm getting at).

I reccomend this to fans of British comedy and mainstream horror. I knocked off a star, 'cause I thought the actor who played the fatso was pretty horrible.",1107907200,,1173,4.712195121951219
2106557,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead does everything a zombie movie needs to do, and it also manages to be an intelligent comedy that says something not only about the protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg), but about the Britain around him as well.  He is, we have the impression, an observant, smart, young-ish man if given the opportunity.  You might actually say he's got what it takes to be a leader of other men and women, except there are a few things working against him:

The first is his daily routine, which is fit for a zombie.  Every morning he arises, has coffee, toast with jam, dresses for work, heads around the corner to the local Quick-E-Mart, then off to work where his co-workers are practically half his age.  Not exactly inspiring; but throught it all we have the sense that were he spurred by something, he might transcend his situation and become what he was meant to be.

The second thing holding him back is his friend Ed (Nick Frost), who has never left the pub in his mind.  He's fat, obnoxious, vulgar, probably smelly, and particularily charming in those qualities around Shaun's girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).  Ed keep Shaun firmly ensconsed in the local pub, ""The Winchester,"" and is his compatriot in underachievment.  Such is the extent of Ed's underachieving ways that when he picks up the apartment, we're not even sure he's done it since the place becomes messy before Shaun gets home.  He does have redeeming qualities; at least he's not Pete, the responsible one, whom Shaun would be were it not for the world around him.

Suddenly; in the midst of routine, drinking at the Winchester, dealing with his stepdad Phil (Bill Nighy), and trying to patch things up with Liz, zombies begin to walk the earth.  The explanation (and it's very brief) is that it's a sickness infecting the locals.  Of course this is a commentary on everyday Britains and their routine; emblematic in Shaun.  He is basically the original zombie before people start eating brains.  He has no variety in his life, no hopes of breaking out of that humdrum because he lacks the ambition within him.  Basically, zombies are humans whose life have betrayed their minds; the only difference with Shaun is that he doesn't moan, lumber around and try to eat people.

Oddly enough, the emergence of zombies gives him exactly what he needs to at least touch on his potential.  His stepfather succumbs to the zombies, only after an actually very heartfelt speech that is probably one of three sincere moments that evoke both pity and fear.  His problems with Liz evaporate in the face of the greater good, and she actually starts defending his decisions to the obnoxious David who's only there to second-guess Shaun.  It's okay though; he dies badly.

The film has some truly hilarious scenes, espcially when they decide which LPs to throw at the zombies to try and decapitate them.  The Batman soundtrack doesn't survive this round.  Of course who would have thought a cricket bat would work so well?  It's a solid zombie-crushing implement; a piece of life in the zombie world.

The extras are great to watch, espcially the Zomb-o-meter, which acts like VH-1's old ""Pop Up Videos"" where trivia and info pops up on screen as you watch the film.

This is definitely a film for any zombie freak; it does something that a lot of good zombie movies don't make you do, which is laugh deliberately.",1107907200,3,3368,4.743986254295533
2106558,1,B0002MJT0I,"When I saw this film had been rated 4 1/2 stars I nearly fell out of my chair. Why? because this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a synopsis on this movie, look else where. Me and my cousin decided to give this a try. About 3/4 the way through we got up and left. It was just so horrible. It was slow paced, NOT funny, boring, had characters you really hate and are unlike-able, and just made you want to puke. The acting wasn't too bad, but the rest was. I can only remember one funny bit, and it wasn't even that funny. It's a horrible rip-off of 'Dawn of the Dead.'

This movie does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. Awsome movies like The Evil Dead trilogy deserve 4 1/2 stars, even five. But this, no way. I'm guessing the reason why this film was rated so high was because most of the reviewers were British (no offense) and blinded by pride, which they have a right too. But it was just plain horrible. I hope most of you won't vote my review as being bad simply because I hate a movie you like, that's intolerant.

2106559,5,B0002MJT0I,"Horror and comedy don't always mesh well together. Only a few movies have been able to marry both of them successfully with one antoehr (like Raimi's Evil Dead series for instance). Well, our generation finally has its great horror comedy. And it's called Shaun of The Dead.

Shaun is a boring guy who's boring life has lost all of its charms. Now, on the night he breaks up with his girlfriend, he'll be faced with the greatest battle of his life. London is infested with zombies and it will be up to him to save his mother and his ex-girlfriend from this terrible tragedy.

This one is a laugh-a-minute marathon that ends up being pretty scary in its last half hour. As Shaun makes it across London to get from one place to the other, the movie also juxtaposes the fact that we, in real life, have also become zombies. At one point, Shaun is looking at some of the people sitting on a bus with him, and they look exactly like what the zombies are about to look like.

The movie is perfectly cast and the plot brightly written. The balance between horror and comedy is realized in a way that is worthy of all the praise it can get. Neither horror or comedy dominates here.

I'm so happy that this British flick was able to achieve the things it did. Let it be a lesson to filmmakers in North America; remakes aren't original. Flicks like Shaun of the Dead are. This is one horror comedy that will survive the test of time!",1107734400,,1423,4.378787878787879

2106561,5,B0002MJT0I,"If the jokes and sight gags came just a bit more rapid paced you'd swear this film would have been made by the Zucker Brothers.  As Airplane skewered Aircraft disaster films and Naked Gun skewered cop dramas, Shaun of the dead is a rousing parody, and yet glorious tribute to zombie films, particularly those of George Romero.

This is one of those films that requires 100% attention as there are just as many things going on in the backgound as there are in the foreground and if you don't pay attention, you'll miss some of the very ingenious tips of the hat that director Edgar Wright gives to those movies that he pays tribute to.  Listen to those radio and TV broadcasts playing in the background, keep your eyes on what those zombies are doing way down the street...it's all clever stuff.  I particularly love the radio report blaming an American Spacecrafts return descent as a possible explanation of the zombie phenomena.

Shaun takes it's cue mainly from DAwn of the Dead.  Shaun is played by Simon Pegg.  He's a 29 year old electronics store loser.  He's just lost his girlfriend Liz, he's regretting a trip the following day to his mother's house and dealing with his stepfather.  He shares a flat with Ed, a lazy, overweight, crude couch potato whose even a bigger loser than Shaun.  While out to get some goods from the convenience store, Shaun is completely oblivious to the dead bodies and shambling zombies in his neighborhood.  Quite a wonderful skewering of middle America...err...England, just as Romero did in Dawn.

Soon Shaun and Ed encounter the first zombies in their back yard and eventually discover you can take them out in similar Romero fashion by destroying the brain.  Thus the pair begins a plan of rescuing Shauns 'mum', his ex Liz, and her friends Dianne and David and taking refuge not in a mall, but in hilarious English style, the local pub!  Along the way the little group of survivors dodges zombies through suburban back yards, arguing amongst themselve and even encounters another group of survivors who match them almost identically as if from Bizarro world.

Shaun of the Dead is the best Zombie movie in many years.  Better than both ""28 Days Later"" and the ""Dawn"" remake because of its style, and also because it follows the number one rule of Zombies: Zombies are SLOW and shambling.  They are not sprinters!  Shaun's amusing digs of these two films will certainly not be lost on anyone who's seen them.  Kudos again for Mr. Wright for calling them out.

If I have one complaint, it's that the last 3rd of the film is played mostly as a straight zombie horror film and the comedy takes a bit of a back seat.  But the ending does save it as Director right gives one last bow to George Romero by tipping his hat to ""Day of the Dead""

The funny part is when Shaun and Ed are in the backyard and think the zombie is a drunk woman and then start throwing records at two zombies.

2106567,5,B0002MJT0I,"I remember seeing a trailer for SHAUN OF THE DEAD as a preview to another movie I was seeing at the 'insert name of major theater chain' Cineplex 16.  I made an immediate mental note NOT to miss this one, as the concept was totally original.  More on that in a moment.

As it turns out, I never got to see it. So once the DVD was available, I raced to the video store to pick up a copy. What a wise investment it turned out to be.

Unlike the completly regrettable so-called 'horror comedies' in the 'Scary Movie-esque' style, SHAUN is for all intents a legitimate horror flick. The film does not attempt to sacrifice macabre for laughs; rather, it weaves the humour into the horror.

One of the creepiest aspects of apocalyptic horror movies is that critical first day, when we first get a glimpse of the collapse of society, in this case brought on by the zombi-fication of, well, everybody.  How does our pal Shaun process this?  By completely overlooking the bloody handprints on the cooler door at his favorite convenience store.  What a stud!

And not to give away the ending, but the film actually comes up with a cure for death.

SHAUN OF THE DEAD is an ingenious blend of comedy and gore, and makes a genuine stab--if you will--at layering its characters (my favorite scene is the argument among Shaun, Ed, and the other flat-mate at 4:00a).

But SOTD delivers as both a zombie flick and a comedy (a zomedy, if you will), and on many levels. There's some great, ummm, brainless slapstick, but there's also many Seinfeld-esque setups hatched throughout, always coming full-circle & paying big dividends. On the other side, it offers a little credibility as a horror flick as well, delivering some genuinely startling moments...arguably, moreso than many of the so-called ""straight"" horror movies of late.

But Shaun Of The Dead mostly succeeds because of its characters. Instead of just being zombie fodder, they're people you get attached to & hope make it out alive---and be able to meet you for a few pints afterward. In fact, this film probably wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for the great character development. And I'd also like to add: Lucy Davis (as Dianne) can melt the entire room with her puppy-dog eyes, without her saying a single word...she'd own me, for sure LOL

Shaun of the Dead has a character all its own.  This movie gave me the impression that some people who really wanted to have fun while making a movie got together and did just that.

This is like the Scary Movie spoofs, only ten times better.  Simon Pegg, besides in the movie, just seems like the kinda guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with.  He has that ""it"" factor people always talk about - a universal appeal if you will.  He is great at what he does - act.  Pegg makes this movie a blast to watch, and I'll bet he made it a lot of fun to film too.  Hey Pegg, if you read this review, next time you're in Chicago, Illinois, look me up.  I'll meet ya for a brewsky.  Maybe I could write your next film.

Kate Ashfield is well...hmmm...how do a I say this?  Easy on the eyes - does a wonderful job as Shaun's girlfriend.  She also seems like a very down-to-earth person who manages to make her role in a spoof movie still be interesting.  Not an easy task.  But that is what this movie does best; it spoofs the zombie genre without going over the edge.  You still care about what happens to the cast, and at the same time have fun watching the zombies try and eat them.  Only this amazing cast (all of you involved can pat yourselves on the back now) could pull that off.

A simple story of everyday normal people dealing with the fact that the dead are coming back to life and how it affects their everyday lives. I almost didn't go to see this as I thought it was going to be a spoof of the original Dawn Of The Dead, which I didn't like or its Hollywood remake which I did like, released at the same time in Europe. Happily I found out that the only thing it had in common with those films was a similar title and loads of zombies. Probably the funniest film I've seen in a long time that's actually made me laugh. As it happens I saw this in Canada and was at times during it, the only one laughing!! Who hasn't had a strawberry cornetto to ease the pain of a bad hangover. With Dog Soldiers, Deathwatch, 28 Days Later and now Shaun Of The Dead, perhaps Hollywood should kept an eye on British film makers who can produce excellent and original horror movies with a fraction of the big budgets Hollywood pumps into all it's current horror remakes.",1106265600,,1064,4.272277227722772

2106575,4,B0002MJT0I,"I saw trailers for this film on the internet before it was release and couldn't wait to see it.....ON DVD.  No one would ever want to come see the film in the theater, so I made all my friends watch it with me when it was thankfully released on DVD.

When the film began I had fairly low expectations, figuring I'd just wasted $20 - but was I wrong?!  Yes!  Shaun of the Dead is the epitome of British humor - self effacing, subtle, and hilarious!

Just a quick note:  If you think that SOTD is going to be an all out gore-fest, you're mistaken.  There are a handful of 'bloody' instances but they are quite brief.  There are some shocking (scary) moments but it isn't all that scary simply because the film takes place in the DAYTIME, which in itself is rather amusing.

In short, SOTD is a zombie horror romantic comedy.  Several snippets you will need to rewind because of the occassionally thick British accents, but keep an ear out for the subtle humor.

Make sure you watch the extras, too - it will answer some questions you may have during the film.

2106577,4,B0002MJT0I,"All I ever heard about this movie was how funny it was. Somehow, from all the people I talked too, no one decided to mention that buried beneath the comedy and romance, lay an extremely well crafted horror movie.

The movie is extremely funny in a British way, like a new generation of Monty Python. Its played wacky at some moments and serious, but really funny, at other times.  And it's this balance between the two that make this movie as funny as it is. The movie is also a nice homage to past George Romero zombie films, which I really enjoyed because I'm a big fan of that whole trilogy.

The movie centers on Shaun, a lay about slacker and his friend who is an even bigger slacker and one of those guys that most people just don't like.  Shaun has a girlfriend, whose tired of always going to the same pub, and fed up with hanging out with Shaun's same friend. She ends their relationship and the next day the country is overrun with zombies.  Now Shaun and his friend are on the run, trying to save his ex-girlfriend as well as his mum and stepdad who he's not to fond of.

Hilarity ensues as arguements over which old records should be used as weapons and where they should go after rescuing everyone.  And what better place to go than the local pub.

As everyone gathers together the movie takes on the feel of Night of the Living Dead with everybody in the group not getting along so well.  Shaun becomes an unlikely hero all while trying to protect his mum and win back his girl.  The violence and gore in the movie was something that suprised me, albeit, a very welcome surpise. But its the reason the movie worked so well.  It was able to so finely walk the line between good horror movie, great comedy and winning romance all wrapped into one nice little package.

Another welcome return is the walking zombies.  I don't mind the running ones, from last years Dawn of the Dead remake or 28 Days Later(although I would be more inclined to argue that they weren't really zombies, just people hopped up on a disease that caused rage, but whatever), but I grew up on the walking zombies and find them to be a little bit more scary.

All and all, a great horror comedy with decent DVD extras.",1105920000,2,2203,4.380835380835381

Women who have amazing taste and aren't morons will love this movie for it's subversive humor, gore, and all-around fun feel.

Skip The Notebook, and stock up on this, along with other great zombie flicks!",1105747200,4,581,4.631067961165049
2106579,5,B0002MJT0I,"I've heard a lot of mixed reaction to this movie, though the buzz is primarily positive -- touting the flick's exceptional funny, its glorious messy, and its marvelous silly.

Maybe I'm just a big fat dork who spent too much time in graduate school, but I seemed to plug into this movie on a somewhat different plane of appreciation. For thing one, I didn't think it was terribly funny.  It had its moments, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it a ""comedy."" And for a second thing, I found it genuinely suspenseful -- which is not something you often hear shouted from the applause bandwagon. More often than not I hear that it's ""a laugh riot in the tradition of Scary Movie."" This comparison has been waved around several times in print and online, and it seems wildly off-base to me, if not downright insulting.

The Scary Movie franchise, while being fun for what it is, is not supposed to mean anything. It's simple parody, produced for masses which are only marginally discriminatory in their entertainment requirements. SOTD has entirely too much going on inside to be relegated to mere imitation status.

George Romero and his apologists have long insisted that the original Dawn of the Dead (and its zombies-in-the-mall theme) was a satire on the mindless consumerism and the tedium of modern life. This is the critical equivalent of putting an evening gown on a pig, but whatever. The very same theme was tackled much more effectively without zombies in American Beauty, and much better with zombies in Shaun of the Dead -- a film which actually manages to make a clever statement on the subject.

Much of the perceived hilarity in this film occurs at the beginning and the end, wherein the satire is more light-hearted (if unsubtle). The great conceit of the first thirty-five minutes is that the zombies are encroaching upon Shaun's day-to-day reality bubble ... but he doesn't notice, and at first, neither does anyone else. The drooling, coughing, slowly lumbering undead gradually replace the drooling, coughing, slowly lumbering pulse-bearing characters who have periodic walk-on roles in Shaun's life. But no red flags are raised.

Shaun is neither bothered by the change nor molested by the zombies themselves, who (one is led to suspect) view him as one of their own. He wanders through his daily routine as if he's wearing blinders; he's worn a rut between his home and his place of employment, and this rut is so deep that it serves as a psychological buffer. Shaun is furthermore isolated from the impending threat by his post-getting-dumped state of sorrow, which prevents him from paying closer attention to his surroundings.

But eventually, the carnage cannot escape the notice of even the hopelessly self-involved Shaun and his filthy-yet-lovable best friend Ed. Action must be taken. His parental units must be rescued. Liz, despite her fresh status of ex-girlfriend, must be saved. Shaun and Ed have, at their collective disposal: one zombiefied roommate's vehicle, a cricket bat, and a plan to seek shelter at a pub called the Winchester.

Quoth the Blues Brothers: ""Hit it.""

At any rate, although the movie ends on an ""up"" note (more or less) and there were giggles to be had, I found the bulk of the film to be calculated and oppressive -- a deftly executed surgical extraction of a man from his suffocating safety zone, and a grim (yet oddly uplifting) morality fable about appreciating what you have without unthinking presumption. All in all, I thought this was a damn fine film and I really enjoyed it. It made me laugh, it made me think, and it made me cringe.

2106580,5,B0002MJT0I,"Here's an interesting turn on the zombie-invasion genre: what if people go on with their lives, and don't even know what's going on?  How many days would it take for you to realize?  There's a touch of that in the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" (so these two in the graveyard don't listen to the radio?  How many days have the attcks been happening?).  Brilliantly, the filmmakers here realized that the concept of impending doom is just as scary as zombies eating flesh.  Glimpses of zombies casually viewed off in the distance is scary stuff.

Besides being a pitch-perfect horror film (there is some serious gore, be warned), it's also very, very funny.  Never does it go lame on us, it's Fawtly Towers, Ab Fab, Monty Python-level funny.  Leave it to the British to concoct such a dry approach to total armageddon.  Whats more, the movie has a big heart, and an endearing troop of characters we pray won't end up as food.

I'm bummed that I did't get to see this with an audience.  I would love to have experinced the mix of terror and elation.

2106582,5,B0002MJT0I,"This is the type of zombie film horror fans have been aching for since ""Evil Dead II"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead.""  The writing is suprisingly intelligent and altogether tongue-in-cheek.  The gore is everywhere and so realistic as to invoke heartfelt cringing...often followed by a burst of laughter.  I want to relate sequences that are not only funny but sociologically profound (no kidding), but to give away these scenes would spoil the effect of the film.  As with George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" there is more depth to this film than at first glance, with comparisons between zombies and mankind that are blurred to the point of being almost identical.  Once again I have to inhibit myself from giving away too much.  Yet another additive that sets this film apart from the rest of the genre is that all the characters are worth rooting for and caring about.  There are actually some touching scenes with authentic emotions indicating that although there are many ridiculous moments loaded with humor, these are real people caught in a life or death situation.  The way this film shifts from true horror and pain to slapstick (sometimes literally ""slapstick"") makes this a remarkable creation.  There are many subtle, sometimes vague references to many films such as ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""Snatch,"" ""28 Days Later,"" the two aforementioned walking dead films, and even a mood-altering thud in the score that reminded me of John Carpenter's ""The Thing.""  I have seen many zombie films before, but never one as thoughtfully created as this one.  This is a superb addition to the genre.  Highly recommended.",1105488000,10,1615,4.985074626865671

They argue over which records to use to immobilize the zombies, which I found amusing.

2106588,5,B0002MJT0I,"Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of horror-comedies.  I mean, what are two of the strongest humor emotions?  Fear and happiness.  Horror-comedies mix these two elements, and if done correctly - which is no easy feat - you can have one darn fine movie.  And ""Shaun of the Dead"" is just that.  I've been looking forward to this movie since I first saw it advertised in U.S. theaters, and I can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectations.

Simon Pegg (who has gained some popularity overseas for performing in the British TV show ""Spaced"") stars as Shaun, a 30-year-old Brit who is stock with a crappy job and a crappy stepfather (Bill Nighy), among other things.  Then there's his slacker best friend, Ed (Nick Frost).  When his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumbs Shaun, it looks like his life has taken the final step towards hell.

But Shaun is given a chance to win back Liz, as well as fix things up with his mother (Nicola Cunningham) and stepdad.  How?  Simple: he just has to defend them all against a neighborhood full of zombies.

I've always been a fan of movies like ""Evil Dead II"", ""Re-Animator"", and George Romero's original ""Dead"" trilogy.  As a fan, I can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love ""Shaun of the Dead"".  The script, by Edgar Wright and star Pegg, knows when to bring in some comedy and when to let loose the horror.  (When it does bring in horror, the casual moviegoer's stomach will no doubt flip - ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you, while he's still living, and his guts eaten?)

The cast is terrific, Pegg especially.  You care about the characters, and the only one who I didn't care about was ... uh ... dealt with.  Edgar Wright manages to make the film look like a comedy when there's something funny going on, but when there's any horror (especially towards the end of the film), his direction becomes quite dark.

What can I say?  This is one of the best films of the year, and easily the best horror-comedy in years.  I was entertained throughout the entire film.  Hilarious and absorbing, ""Shaun"" is anything but dead.",1104796800,3,2130,4.4921875

I loved how Shaun doesn't even notice them at first--a comment about people who live their lives half asleep.  Shaun doesn't even watch the news.  When he does notice them, he is not all that afraid of them, and simply bashes them over the head with his cricket bat.

2106591,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright's parody of the zombie sub-genre of motion pictures, does almost everything right.  It is a comedy with a heart, and more importantly, a great and consistent idea of what it is spoofing, (an element missing in other spoofs, such as parts of the Scary Movie films).  If you are at all familiar with zombie films, you will be laughing from the first scene to the last, and although the film is not a laugh-a-minute (it is a bit more serious than the trailers made it out to be), it offers up enough pokes and prods at other zombie films to keep even the most die-hard zombie fan entertained.

  Shaun works in an electronics store, lives with two roommates in London, one of which is his best friend Ed, whom, despite trying hard to keep people happy always seems to wind up disappointing instead.  Shaun's girlfriend Liz breaks up with him, since his life does not seem to have a direction, and he spends all his nights at the pub in town, the Winchester.  Overnight, however, a virus spreads like wildfire through the streets of London, and people become zombies left and right.  Shaun takes it upon himself to save his mother, Ed, and Liz and her two roommates.

  The movie, (whose title, an obvious spoof on George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", the secon in his zombie trilogy [soon to be a quadrilogy]), knows its influences well.  There are more than a couple homages to Romero's work, from newsreporters uttering famous lines from ""Night of the Living Dead"", to Ed screaming ""We're coming to get you Barbara!"" on the telephone to Shaun's mother, Barbara.

  Zombie regulars will also find references to the Evil Dead trilogy, a subtle but hilarious poke of fun at Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and more.

2106595,4,B0002MJT0I,"I tried to see this film twice in theaters, and failed both times. The first time was because the theater that was supposed to be playing abruptly changed their schedule and didn't notify the papers. The second time was because I had brought a pretty girl with me (Hormones and whatnot, you understand), and, since she was only 16, they would not let us in. It was the only time I'd EVER been carded (I've been able to pass for a man in his thirties since I was 17), and we couldn't see it. I was in pain, which only increased when she decided we should see THE GRUDGE instead.

Luckily, this movie proved to be worth all the trouble and wait. It's hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. Shaun and Ed are two very believable slackers who I'd very much like to hang out with. And they handle the situation pretty much like every other slacker I know would: Badly. But they more or less get through it.

Mind you, this movie does seem to shift attitudes a lot. One second it's goofy comedy, the next it's suspense, the next it's flat out gory horror. It may get on some people's nerves. It didn't mine, so I ended up loving the flick. This would make an excellent double feature with the new DAWN OF THE DEAD. You can compare the filmmaker's attitudes toward the whole zombie genre.

The film that I think comes closest as far as marrying these elements is ""An American Werewolf in London"" from 1981 but I think this film is more successful.  The films conceit is that prior to confronting real zombies, Shaun is in fact a zombie.  That point is obvious and it's not beaten into the ground.  It's not until Shaun has to do battle with the real McCoy that he breaks out of his funk.  Pegg is excellent in the title role, handling both the comic and action demands superbly.  Nick Frost as Ed, Shaun's best friend, is a hoot.  Not since John Belushi's Bluto in ""Animal House"" in 1978 has the screen seen such a memorably unapologetic slob.

While ""Shaun of the Dead"" is predominantly a spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead"", it does touch on a variety of different topics in a semi-serious way.

The title character Shaun is a 29 year old stuck in a dead end job supervising teenage co-workers. He can't seem to get it right with his girlfriend, Liz, and he never goes to visit his mother.

What makes this movie hilarious is that it took an apocalyptic event for Shaun to get his life in gear.  While that doesn't sound funny, it surely is made funny by Simon Pegg's performance as Shaun.

Great dialog, a new twist on a common horror theme, and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film.  I wouldn't take anyone squeemish to go see it, but all violence is made to look obviously fake and is done in a slap-stick manner.

Catch this one when you can, it's spectacular!",1104451200,,963,4.340782122905028

It has a campy feel to it, although it was never cheesy and has some clever scenes. There are scenes that'll make you jump out of your seat, and other scenes that will make you laugh.

After hanging out in the local pub, strange things start happening around him then the next morning, him and his friend discover on the TV news that a plague have turned people into slow-moving creatures that feed on human flesh, they soon escape with some surviors including his girlfriend and mom in a local pub for shelter then battle the undead.

A hilarious, entertaining and different zombie movie all the way from the UK that parodies George Romero's zombie trilogy and other movies of it's genre especially Lucio Fulci movies. What also works for this movie is social satire with dark humor, gore abound, some Goblin music from the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the scene where Shaun is struggling with a zombie then the fat slob roommate takes a picture of them was hilarious.

The DVD has great extras like featurettes, bloopers, Trailers, Deleted scenes, audio commentaries, flawless picture & flawless sound and more.

This movie and DVD is a definite keeper for every zombie and horror fan's library, the movie itself is one of the most refreshing zombie movies in years and one of the best movies of the year destined to be a cult favorite.

2106604,4,B0002MJT0I,"Despite the rather corny title, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a funny and often brilliant, even intelligent spoof on horror films, in this case, zombies in particular.  The story is almost the same as George Romero's (or Zack Snyder's) one.  An Englishman Shawn working for an electronical shop wakes up one morning, and finds that everybody is acting weird.  The difference is, however, he does not find a makeshift shelter in shopping center -- but in a pub named 'Winchester' where he goes with his pal Ed who loves TV games.

That's it, 'Shaun of the Dead' is filled with British humor, peppered with occasional pop culture references.  It understands the rules of so many zombie films, and twists and uses it for its own purpose to make us laugh.

The film, as is the case with intelligent films, works as off-beat comedy.  See one incredibly hilarious scene where Shawn, himself being 'in the weather' because of the last night's booze, walks in the street, not noticing at all that the town has already been full of the zombies roaming.  Among them Shaun keeps on walking, not realizing the emergency around him.

Or think about this; 'What do you do when you find a zombie strayed into your garden?'  Shawn thinks the femele zombie is just drunk, or fooling around (why not?) until he and Ed do realize that she is a real thing.

The writer/director team is, I was told, behind the British TV show called 'Spaced.'  Unlike these lucky UK viewers, those audiences living outside the country probably may not know the faces of the actors (except Bill Nighy, middle-aged rocker in 'Love Actually'),  But that doesn't matter as long as you love this genre -- horror or spoof.

I find the latter half is slightly weak when the film starts to run short of its initial clever tricks.  But the ending, which is quite original, would makes it up for the loss of creative energy that keeps up the entire film several notched higher than usual spoofs.  I don't say it's genius's work, but is often makes us feel like that, especially in the first half.  Enjoy this brainy horror/comedy.",1104278400,,2076,4.674931129476584

Imagine going through the motions of life, year after dreadful year, until one day the world is inundated by zombie flesheaters. Now, imagine yourself not noticing the holocaust, due to your own zombie-like deadness! That's what the title character does, wandering through his daily rituals, oblivious to the carnage and chaos swirling around him!

Shaun must take control and use his wits for what appears to be the first time in his life. He must battle both the zombie horde and the idiocy of Ed! Can this simple nobody be the warrior / savior of his friends? Can he stand against the terror while everyone around him falls apart? This movie lampoons the zombie film, while skewering the routines we find ourselves in. It takes a normal guy like Shaun and tosses him into the shark tank of the unknown.

2106610,4,B0002MJT0I,"Great Zombie movie, great comedy.  Hindsight is always 20/20, but if I had to go back in time I would have skipped the Dawn of the Dead remake and just watched this one.  It manages to keep some of the thematic elements of the Romero trilogy while adding a bit of smart humor.  Zombification in this film has a physiological reason (which is hidden thanks to some well-timed channel-flipping) but on a subtle note zombification is a result of everyday routine -- societal norms that are pushed upon us and to which we conform.  The ""zombie"" by itself is slow, dumb, predictable and thus easy to kill.  They are only dangerous in large groups.  The same is true with any ideal to which one is tempted to conform.  One person usually cannot sway another individual, but a massive number of people doing one thing or thinking one thing may easily convince the nonconforming individual.  The so-called ""Dawn of the Dead remake"" completely misses this element of the zombie ethos by making fast zombies.  Shaun of the Dead, on the other hand, delivers on all levels: theme, gore, action and plot.  This is a wonderful British homage to Romero that just happens to be pretty funny.

As for the DVD, the commentaries and interviews are some of the best out there.  The DVD is almost worth buying for the extras alone.  It is always fun when the director and/or writer is willing to open himself as such to the viewer.",1104192000,2,1410,4.614457831325301

I've seen the good zombie comedies, Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness...this one falls short of all of them by miles.

2106614,5,B0002MJT0I,"When I think of people that watch zombie movies like ""Night of the Living Dead"", and are actually fans, I think of would-be film maker types that use words like ""poignant"" and ""glorious"" and ""genius"" a lot when describing obscure films that are about as interesting as my big toe.

The movie trailer initially intrigued me because unlike most movies, it doesn't show you the best parts of the movie and make you feel cheated once you watch it. However, this movie seemed sort of forgotten and I did not run across it again until yesterday I rented it on a whim.

It tells the story of Shaun (Simon Pegg) as he begins possibly the worst 24 hours of his life. His girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) has dumped him, and you can't blame her as they never spend quality time together.  Why?  Because Shaun's roomie and childhood friend Ed (Nick Frost), is in the way. All the two pals want to do seemingly is to hang out at The Winchester Pub getting drunk. Also, Shaun's other room mate, Peter (Peter Serafinowicz)is getting fed up with Ed because he is a slacker, brings in no money, contributes nothing toward cleaning up, and is generally an irresponsible, farting slob.

So, after Liz dumps Shaun, he and Ed go to the Winchester, and pretty much close it down, unaware as they trudge through their hangovers that zombies have been roaming the streets.

From the point at which they realize what is happening, Shaun, who is fed up with being a loser, takes the initiative to get himself and loved ones out of this mess. Naturally, they hole up at the Winchester.

What sets this movie apart is that it is hilarious. The absurdity in the humor goes places that this type of movie never goes, and yet, it manages somehow to seem very natural. After all, what would you do in that situation?!

The characters are lovable, funny, and have a realness to them that generally doesn't exist in any horror movie, and certainly  not a comedy-horror. They all play off one another so well that you truly feel like they are these characters, and not just actors playing them. They have some depth to them, and while I am not claiming that they are at the level of characters in some ""serious"" movie, they go beyond the norm of this genre in making the heroes come to life...or death.

Even if you aren't some film maker wannabe, this is a zombie movie everyone can enjoy. This isn't a B-movie, though it pokes fun at them without losing itself in the satire as ""Scary Movie"" type movies have done. Neither does it lose itself in the trite formulas of horror movies. While some of it is predictable, the characters and story line show that a little more effort was put forth.

2106615,5,B0002MJT0I,"This brilliantly funny and romance/zombie/comedy is everything an older horror fan could ask for.  Shaun of the Dead, the brainchild of star/co-writer Simon Pegg and director/co-writer Edgar Wright provides loads of laughs while piling on buckets of blood and gore along the way.  Pegg plays Shaun, a late-20's electronics salesman who soon realizes his life is going nowhere.  His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) has just dumped him, which soon follows his attempt to drown his sorrows at the local pub with his slacker pal Ed (Nick Frost).  All the while, all of Britain is under siege by a fast spreading zombie plague, and soon enough, Shaun and Ed are bashing heads and spilling brains in an effort to save Liz, Shaun's mother and stepfather, and a few other friends while trying to make way to the pub.  Paying homage to the original Dawn of the Dead as well as other films in the genre (""we're coming to get you Barbara!""), Shaun of the Dead is a joy from beginning to end.

It's singlehandedly the best zombie movie to come along in a long time, and while it's horror elements aren't original in the least, it doesn't try to be.

2106617,5,B0002MJT0I,"It could be called a habit, it could be called an obsession...I call it love.

I had heard about ""Shaun of the Dead"" about a year ago.

And, as always with ANY film dealing with the Living Dead, the anticiapation grew.  Over the years, since George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" drew my attention, I had used Romero's films as a basis for what a 'good' zombie film should look like, feel like...(taste like?)...

Normally, when it comes to horror mixing with comedy in films, most viewers are disappointed.  There's a 'recipe' for integrating these two genres, and most outcomes are disasterous.  I must admit that I prefer straight-up horror; I love the feeling of my adrenaline racing, the feel of encompasing darkness surrounding me in a theatre as I watch the story unfold.  But, occasionally, a film will slip through that cover and hit me because of it's unique style, with such force, that I have to admit that, yes, the two genres can work off of one another...It just takes a director with great timing, actors who can deliver the lines with superb authority and a pace that draws me in as a viewer.

With ""Shaun of the Dead"", I found all of that...And more!

As a parody of Zombie films, and playing off George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" title, ""Shaun of the Dead"" introduced us to the title character, Shaun.  Following a typical day in Shaun's life as a retail clerk, the audience is introduced to a cast of lively characters (well, in the beginning they are alive).  The director uses a number of quirky relationships to play off one another as the world starts to fall apart, and the dead begin to walk.  A number of times, I sat there, feeling that, maybe, just maybe, Shaun was starting to catch on to what was going on in the world around him, but, no, Shaun just...well, he just didn't get it.  With this, it was the timing that worked, the delivery of the lines and, all in all, the reactions of the actors to the environment and situation that made the scenes work.

Peter Jackson brought us ""Dead Alive"" a few years back.  A film about the Living Dead, splashed with comedy, ""Dead Alive"" succeeded in following the 'recipe' for combining the horror and comedy genres.  With ""Shaun of the Dead"", we have seen success again.  Sure, there are moments of horrific violence, but it's done in such a light-hearted way that you can't help but smile as a girl falls back on a metal pipe which pierces a hole several inches wide in her stomach.  The blood is gratuitous at some points, but neither the horror aspects, nor the comedy aspects, distract from one another.

This past week I picked up a copy of ""Shaun of the Dead"", brought it home and watched it...and watched it again...In five days, I had watched the film eight times.  In fact, writing this review has gotten me so fired up over the film again, that I'm going to pop it in and watch it again...

Hold on...

There we go.  Anyways, I need to go make some popcorn.  I have an EXCELLENT film to watch...Again.",1103932800,,2991,4.516728624535316
2106618,5,B0002MJT0I,"SHAWN OF THE DEAD is excellent dark humor !

It pays excellent homage to Romero's flicks.

Oddly enough, although this is a comedy (or spoof) of Zombie films they actually do better job creating an atmosphere of doom and have better looking/acting Zombie scenes than most of the recent ""serious"" Zombie films out there.

I almost wish while they had the crew together making this film, they made 2 movies... one being Shawn of the Dead and the other being a serious horror Zombie film with the same scenes, make-up, acting. etc...",1103932800,,530,4.739130434782608
2106619,5,B0002MJT0I,"Hearing that ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the most popular British zombie comedy of all time does give one pause, simply because you have to stop for a second and wonder as to whether you have simply missed other British zombie comedies or if you maybe took ""28 Day Later"" way too seriously.  The thing is that when you hear ""British zombie comedy"" you are thinking ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" or ""Benny Hill"" or ""Black Adder"" or ""Asbolutely Fabulous"" or ""Coupling.""  You are not thinking something that is as restrained as what Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have put together (the pair co-wrote the film, Pegg stars as Shaun and Wright directs), which is probably the biggest surprise of all.

""Shaun of the Dead"" is only four star funny, so we are not even close to ""Airplane!"" territory, which is still the funniest film of all time (measured in number of laughs generated) but there is another dimension to the film beyond the humor.  The tagline tries to tells us that this movie is: ""A romantic comedy. With zombies.""  The really funny thing is that, underneath it all, it really is a romantic comedy.  You know: boy meets girl, girl dumps boy, zombies try to kill boy and girl and mom and flat mates, boy tries to rescue girl and mom and flat mates, so on and so forth.

Actually the movie that that came to mind the most, despite the references to the great zombie movies of the past (""We're coming to get you, Barbara!""), was ""Young Frankenstein,"" specifically in terms of the scenes that are played totally straight.  There are scenes when Shaun deals with his girl, Liz (Kate Ashfield), his mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton), and his best bud, Ed (Nick Frost) that are done like they were in a romantic comedy, and not an Adam Sandler ""Water Boy"" type romantic comedy, but an Adam Sandler ""50 First Dates"" type romantic comedy.  Stripped of the zombies this is a rather pedestrian romantic comedy, but what makes it inspired lunacy is that it IS being done in the middle of a zombie movie.

There are two prime moments that reflect this rather amazing tightrope walking act.  One is when Shaun almost breaks and notes that there may be a limit as to how many people he loves that he can shoot in one day.  The other is when we have one of those ""goodbye"" scenes usually found in war movies; it is not just the silliness of the particular bit of business returning from the start of the movie, but that it is brought back at that particular moment, and that both actors honestly treat it as the most serious thing in the world.  Tragedy is hard, but comedy is harder, and then there is treating tragedy as comedy in the middle of a zombie movie.  Watching this movie is like watching somebody take a stupid shot in a basketball game and you start saying, ""No, no, no, no, no..."" until the ball rips through the nets and then you smile and say ""Great shot!""

The other great bit of fun is how ""Shaun of the Dead"" plays with the genre movies.  The opening of the film throws every clich moment of being suddenly surprised by zombies in the history of the cinema at Shaun, only to have everything be normal.  So you know they will take a totally different tack when it comes to Shaun realizing he has missed the dawn of the dead.  The bit you have seen in the preview about arguing over which LPs to use as weapons to fight the living dead is cute, but the comic masterpiece in this film is Shaun channel surfing.  Every single channel is talking about what is happening, but Shaun is clicking so rapidly that he misses getting a complete picture.  Note: always listen to what is on the telly in the background: that is where the best ""28 Days Later"" joke in the film comes (All of the talking heads are actually British television news talking heads, so translate that into Brokaw, Jennings, and Rather doing the same thing for an American movie; see the ""TV BITS"" in the DVD extras).

The more you know about zombie movies the more you will enjoy ""Shaun of the Dead,"" because you will be able to pick up on all the specific references.  But then I have never seen ""Spaced,"" so all of the homages to that British situation comedy involving Pegg, Frost and Wright are lost on me and I am doing okay at the moment.  Either way, I think the humor of the film is accessible to even zombie movie neophytes, although the only way you might be able to talk them into seeing this one is to tell them their other choice is ""Dawn of the Dead"" (I do not have to tell anyone that is a rather obvious double bill).

Of the DVD extras the extended bits and outtakes in ""MISSING BITS"" are okay, but by favorite are the trio of ""Plot Holes,"" where we get some insights into what we did not see in the movie from three of the principle characters.  These are presented in comic book form as opposed to having actual footage, but that simply adds to their charm.  There are better bits in ""RAW MEAT,"" the highlight of which is the ""pitch"" by Pegg and Wright to sell the studio their movie idea.  I already talked about the ""TV BITS,"" and no one will be surprised that I the Zombie Trivia available via the ZOMB-O-METER.

(um, yay. A fate to which House of Flying Daggers is no doubt consigned)  Fortunately, it proved  to be more than worth the wait, and was definitely  one of the best movies in a fairly ho-hum year.  As far as comedies go, I think this movie's about as good as it gets.  Of course, I'm a big horror fan, and a big zombie fan, in particular, so this is pretty much aimed right at me.  Still, 'Shaun of the Dead' probably has a lot more general appeal than your typical Horror-Comedy, and I think it should appeal to must people who like comedies that, ya know, don't suck.

Alright, basic setup.  Shaun is a 29 year old guy, who's kinda aimless and going nowhere, at least partially due to his bestfriend/roomate Ed, who's a fat, immature loser.  So, his girlfriend, Liz, dumps him, and he and Ed get really drunk, and where ever the film was heading before is interrupted, as England is then overrun by zombies.  Unlike the more famous horror-comedy films (Evil Dead II, Re-Animator, Dead-Alive), this film actually takes itself fairly seriously at times. (Particularly towards the end, where the characters are all holed in together, appear to be pretty much doomed, and start fighting one another.)  Some people have gone so far as to say this is more Horror film than Comedy, which is massively overstating it, but it's certainly not purely light-hearted fare either. Lots of people think this is a bad thing, but I certainly don't.  It works very well both when it's trying to be funny and when it's trying to be serious/dramatic/touching, and I always like films that are willing to play with tone.(one of the best aspects of the original Dawn of the Dead, imo)  I also particularly like the  more serious bits, because it makes it abundantly obvious that the makers of the film have a genuine affection for the genre they're parodying.

The film has a level a visual flair and an attention to detail which are pretty extraordinary for a comedy, and quite impressive, regardless of genre.  They use lots of great long, steadicam shots and some fun, ultra-kinetic, rapid fire editing. (used to comedic, rather than dramatic effect)  The detail comes in how there's lots going on in the background, and how the film likes to repeat similar scenarios, before and after the zombie attack, and of course, the numerous references to other films.  They're particularly fond of referencing the original Living Dead trilogy, naturally, with a particular penchant for the Evil Dead films as well.  Still, it doesn't rely on Horror films alone, referencing The Deer Hunter and Reservoir Dogs, and British tv shows, and probably lots of other stuff I didn't catch.  I also like how it has the will to be subtle- you probably won't notice the references if you aren't familiar with the original material. (i.e. there aren't any moments in the film where it's abundantly obvious that what someone did/said was a reference so something, but you don't know what it is.  At least there weren't for me)

Reviewing comedies is hard.  All I can say is that I though it was funny. Very funny.  It smarter than your average comedy, I suppose, but it isn't afraid of slapstick or lowbrow humor either. Going into specifics would be pretty fruitless, and hurt the film when you actually see it, so I won't bother. You'll just have to trust me on this one.

It's also got a surprising amount of gore, which is generally nicely done. There are quite a few nicely done gunshots, and two particularly stunning headshots. Furthermore, this film doesn't ever let us forget that zombies eat flesh, and there's scene of someone being ripped limb from limb which recalls a number of deaths from Dawn and Day of the Dead simultaneously.  The zombies themselves look quite nice, though they are fairly low-key.

Yeah, that's about it.  Definitely a great movie, which certainly must be viewed by any zombie fan.",1103846400,,4145,4.7273991655076495
2106622,5,B0002MJT0I,"Good movie, touching romance and our hero Shaun, is a great every man, sure he come off as a bit of a loser, but when it hits  the fan he stands up to the challenge.  No the zombie apacolypse(oops i said the ""z"" word) brings out his best!!

2106623,5,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is by far the best movie of the year and the DVD release has only made it better.

 The movie is about a bored and lazy londoner who gets dumped by his girlfriend on the eve of a massive zombie outbreak. With the help of his best friend Ed they set out to save Shaun's girlfriend Liz and survive the zombie epidemic.

 The acting in this movie is amazing, Simon Pegg (Shaun) and Nick Frost (Ed) giving stunning performances with perfect comic timing, they play off each other extremely well and there isn't a moment in the movie that you don't believe these two are childhood pals.

 This movie although a comedy still remains true to its zombie subplot with lots of gore and amazing visuals, I am a huge fan of zombie films and this one is by far my favorite.

 The DVD features the funniest outtakes (including a Beatles rendition of one of the movies funnier moments), fascinating breakdowns of the most memorable zombie gore special effects, hilarious interview with the band Coldplay and even bonus ""Plot Holes"" that explains the untold segments of the movie.

 Fans of George A Romero will definitely enjoy this funny and scary romantic/zombie/comedy.",1103760000,,1175,4.68780487804878

I had seen the movie in theaters and fell in love with the characters and story line. After I left I knew that this was a movie that I had to own. This movie is called a Romantic, Zombie, Comedy, and it delivers just that. It was written and directed very well and the actors bring it all together with the chemistry between all of them. You feel that perhaps at one time in your life you could relate to atleast one of the characters. The DVD is full of Bonus material, and even that will entertain you. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would definitely give this Movie/DVD a 10. I am going to keep an eye out for any other projects that these group of actors are in.

I won't go any further except to observe that none of the other reviews mention ""Spaced"".  ANY fan of ""Shaun of the Dead"" will LOVE ""Spaced"".  Bizarrely, it's not available on Amazom.com.

2106626,5,B0002MJT0I,"This film appeals to so many people for so many different  reasons, that it's tough to begin a review. For a comedy,  this movie was hillarious! The physical comedy reminded me  a bit of Chris Farley and the Three Stooges. I could watch  this movie a thousand times, and I'd still laugh when  Shaun tries to jump over the fence and it collapses  underneath him. For a romantic movie, it was good enough  to keep my girlfriend glued to her seat, so it get's a  'thumbs up' in that department. And, for a zombie movie,  it's the best one I've seen (and I've seen almost all of  them).

The DVD extras were all very good. It was interresting to see how  they did the special effects (only two examples...more  would have been better) and the plot holes were really  cool. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd have to give this a 9.8.  The only way to make this movie better, would be to have a  cameo with George Romero.

And it even has some shcok value too, not much just the guy getting his guts ripped out toward the end, that was crazy, everything else is hilarious.  Take it from me this is the only comedy EVER worth watching more then once or even at all.  And its really the only zombie movie worth watching too, i mean come on house of the dead? dawn of the dead, 28 days later and nothing happens, the list goes on, THEY ALL SUCK.

2106629,4,B0002MJT0I,It's hard to find a movie you'll have more fun watching this year over Shaun of the Dead. It's stylish with great one-liners and good comic acting. It does manage to even be scary at times. It makes fun of other zombie movies while being one itself. However it's still a much better zombie movie than any of the Resident Evil movies. The violence can even make you cringe at times. It does have times when it takes itself serious and where it can even be touching as well.  It makes for a good movie to watch with buddies and some beers. Can even watch it with your g/f too since there's some romance in there.

For an aspiring screen-writer, there's a feature under ""raw-meat"" that contains footage of simon and edgar going through their ""flip-chart"" of ideas, plans, and...irregular drawings.  These let us view into their world and see what was on their minds as they spawned such a creative plot and characters.  the casting tapes were excellent as well.  Watching simon's video diary made me crack up because it showed the informality in structure.  it shows how much fun they really had behind the scenes...the atmosphere did not seem stressful for one bit.  But my heart goes out to the most creative part of the extras: the plot holes.  everything that was left unexplained? explained.  simple as that.  not to mention, the answers will keep you rolling with laughter.  these features are just compliments to an already amazing movie.

Poor Shaun suffers from the all too common middle man middle child syndrome living with these two men as well as being stepped on at his middle management job.
Plus he competes with his stepdad who makes Shaun feel like a big wussy for being a spineless mommas boy.
Oh and he has a bossy girlfriend who wants Shaun to stand up for himself and take some kind of action in his life.
With all this commotion in his life Shaun fails to see the big picture including the fact that zombies have risen from the grave and started a bloody rampage in his hometown.
By the time he realises this fact two days have passed and those demanding people mentioned above are in danger becoming food for the undead.
Thus springing Shaun into action as he bumbles his way from here to there trying to save these people with no clear reason why or how.
The gore and horror aspect take a backseat here for obvious reasons but are very intense and realistic but funny as hell because we see it all happening in the background as in one scene where Shaun shuffles to and from the store without ever noticing the feeding frenzy going on up and down the street or even when in another scene he mistakes a zombie for a drunk girl in his own backyard!!!

2106642,5,B0002MJT0I,"It saddens me when The horror genre is excluded from all the award ceremonies. Granted a really good one is fewand far between but ""Shaun of the Dead"" to me screams at least golden globe noms for best actor and best picture in comedy. One thing I can definitely vouch is that there haven't been that many worthwhile comedies in 2004 to begin with. Well I can truly say that Shaun of the Dead is the real deal when it comes to a solid comedy, and also a solid horror flick to boot.

It's well known that a truly great comedy can blend different genres of comedy. ""Shaun"" combines verbal wit, with physical comedy, and also satire. Additionally written with an understanding of the minutiae of the zombie genre. For me, the funniest running gag is how the characters shirk to call zombies, well... Zombies, simply because it sounds ridiculous. It's funny because when you look back at every great zombie movie they never call them zombies. The always call them ""Undead"" or ""creatures."" another bit of satire which is truly inspired is the opening credits which brilliantly mocks how there have been zombies, long before there are zombies (if you catch my drift.)

To call ""Shaun of the Dead"" a spoof, would actually be a misnomer, because a spoof relies strictly on the comedy and nothing more. ""Shaun of the Dead"" on the other hand is part of a small (but notorious) breed of horror known simply as comedy / horror. Other notable titles in this genre are Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead Trilogy,"" Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" and Don Coscarelli's ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" The difference between this and a spoof if that a horror/comedy actually has potent moments of horror which have the power to jolt the audience. And Those traits are ever present in ""Shaun of the Dead.""

The standard issue horror jolts are perfectly placed and imaginative. Meanwhile all the scenes where the zombies attack in full force actually invoke a lack of comfort that comes from being surrounded by things that want to kill you.

Not to mention since this takes place in Britan and the posession of firearms is looked down upon over there, it's thoroughly enjoyable to see how our heroes cope, starting by throwing small items, then onto a brilliantly hysterical sequence where they're bickering over which records to launch and the intruding zombies.

""Purple Rain?"" ""No"" ""Batman soundtrack"" ""throw it!""

Another success of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is it's characters. All the characters, including the ones you're supposed to hate are appealing and extremely well written. Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, flawlessly plays the everyman thrown into the macabre situation, but what affects me more about his performance was how Pegg conveys the emotional roller coaster Shaun goes on, as he copes with trying to keep his friends and family alive and simultaneously winning back his girlfriend. Next to him Nick Frost's Ed, is rude, disgusting, moronic and lazy... but that's why we love him. Ed, represents the lovable lug that we all know and have befriended sometime in our life. And it's not because he's practical. It's because he's the kind of guy we want to be round so we ourselves don't have to be. And in the finale of the film you fnd yourself deeply affected by the bond between Shaun and Ed. The love interest, Liz, gamely played by Kate Ashfield Makes for a fantastic horror heroine, and makes it easy for us to understand why Shaun is so wounded when Liz dumps him in the beginning. She also lends a lot to Shaun's development through the course of the film, while at the same time sustaining her memorability.

I could continue ranting about the cast but it would take a while. Just take my word that every cast member gives it their personal 100% which, in recent horror movies, isn't often.

In closing, it essential to repeat my praise for utter brillance of the cohesive mix of gruesome zombie horror, and hysterical British humor. It takes skilled talent to properly balance those elements, through the brilliance of Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright's Writing, the balance is achieved effortlessly.

2106645,5,B0002MJT0I,"This movie has an unfair advantage over most movies: it's British. For some reason, the British are just a whole lot funnier than us Americans. One might argue that comparing the difference between British and American humor is like comparing apples and oranges. I say, there isn't much difference between apples and oranges: they are both fruit, they are both sort of spherical, they are both sweet, they both make a popular juice, hell, they both grow on trees! One is definitely superior to the other. Okay, I am digressing from the point...

Shaun of the Dead is a fine example of dead-on (excuse the pun) British wit. Both main characters are too blitheringly British to take notice of what is going on around them, and when they do realize, they aren't all that affected by the situation.

A fair amount of people didn't find this movie ""laugh out loud"" funny. Sure, there is a lack of farting jokes, but then again, I never found those very funny anyway. Shaun of the Dead is more situation funny. And some jokes are just flat out esoteric. For example, when Ed was tossing records at the zombies he asked Shaun if he could throw the Stone Roses album. Shaun said no. Ed then said ""It's Second Coming."" To get this joke you have to know that the Stone Roses are only respected for their first album and NOT their second, Second Coming, which is collectively agreed as a pretty lousy album (though Shaun sadly admitted to liking it - which is also funny). Most Americans aren't that fimiliar with the Stone Roses, so this joke would go right over their head. Other jokes are just inherently British, they rely entirely on the anti-dramatic execution that made shows/movies like Monty Python, Mr. Bean, The Office and others so very popular and gut-wrenchingly funny.

2106648,5,B0002MJT0I,"If I had to use just one word to describe this film it would be ""FUN!"". Shaun of the Dead continues a steady trend of high quality, small budget British films over the last few years (as I've really enjoyed About a Boy, Maybe Baby, and Love Actually). This film is not a horror film at heart, but a romantic comedy. The film never looses focus of the characters and despite the many zombies, the characters never loose focus of their personal problems. In a way the movie mirrors our world and the way people adapt to their environments. Despite the mounting conflicts and wars worldwide, we as individuals as a whole are still mired in our small personal dramas, weather it be romantic, work related, or little squabbles.

There are scenes that get very intense but the film makers also follow the intensity up with great comedy. Shaun of the Dead is hands down the funniest movie of the year. I laughed out loud multiple times. The laughs are generated mostly by the lead characters, not the zombie's which lends a unique feel to the film.

It's a shame this movie didn't find a wider audience in the theaters. If you are a fan of comedy and are not too squeamish about gore (after all it is a zombie movie) this movie will be quite a treat for you I know I look forward to seeing it again!",1102118400,2,1292,4.401673640167364

Heck no, bring it on!

After seeing Shaun of the Dead, I was surprised that I could stop myself from laughing. The jokes were dead on, they made fun of every aspect of a typical zombie movie, and they did it so well. Even when you see the main character making heart breaking decisions concerning loved ones and a round of bullets he may/may not unload into their chest, you still just have to laugh at how horrible it all is. The way the camera moves, too, is like a horror film, which gets really amusing when they keep dramatically moving the camera to non-threatening objects/people/actions. Another amusing point is how long it takes for Shaun to realize that there's a zombie problem. Even endless TV shows talking about the problem doesn't seem to clue him in, and he goes about daily life like nothing happened.

To reveal more would kill the plot, and I can't very well do that to you. If you missed the movie in theatres, I suggest buying it the second it comes out on DVD and slapping this puppy into your DVD player for a nice, hearty laugh. You won't regret it.

2106650,5,B0002MJT0I,"Look: stop griping. Stop worrying about your lives. Shaun, eponymous cricket-bat wielding hero and ambitionless Foree Electronics employee, has *real* problems. For instance:

1) His love life sucks.

2) His professional life sucks.

3) His best friend is a hopeless slacker who has turned his couch into a kind of fetid nest and spends his entire days wasting away playing X-Box.

4) Oh, and the Dead Walk: Zombies are walking the streets of London and tearing up flesh, and they're equal opportunity offenders with a taste for the guts of any Briton, yuppie *or* slacker.

This is one of those rare little horror gems in which you can believe the hype---and frankly, when I went to see ""Shaun of the Dead"", I was already set *against* the movie: I hate flicks that come to the megaplex ready to do battle after having been given a Super Hype Aerial Shock & Awe campaign by the Indie Movie Establishment.

I stand corrected: ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a zombie movie/horror movie/movie-of-all-time classic, and easily ranks in my top three zombie movies ever made. And mind you, I live, eat, breathe, sleep, and chainsaw these things. Yes, those who hate horror will tell you they love ""Shaun"" because it's all about ""characters"": ; Shaun (Simon Pegg, the flick's writer and note-perfect as the reluctant zombie slayer), a one-time pathetic directionless loser who gets *very* good with a cricket bat; Liz (Kate Ashfield, very plummy), Shaun's disaffected squeeze who wants to ""live a little""; Mum (Penelope Wilton as ""Barbara""), always looking on the Sunny Side even when she's undergoing a really major life change (as in, dietary change, as in, sudden interest in blood and guts); Philip (the amazing English actor Bill Nighy, who I didn't even recognize in this flick---he played the Uber-Vampire Viktor in ""Underworld""---who knew?), who takes care of his Jaguar to the bitter end.

Yeah, it has characters.

But you know something? ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a full-bodied, full-blooded horror movie. It's just one of those rarest of ghoulish gemstones: a horror movie with a wickedly black sense of humor and an impeccable, deeply British, sense of timing. And the timing here is perfect. For my money, the scene in which Shaun goes for some beer in his devastated, zombie-overrun London burb---completely oblivious to the carnage---is one of the best sequences in cinematic history.

I haven't seen ""Spaced"", the TV series that ""Shaun"" director Edgar Wright helmed, but I can say that for a relative newcomer Wright can wield a mean camera. He's backed up by cinematographer David Dunlap, who serves as heavy weapons tech on on the cinematic black magic: my God, this movie looks good! And let's back up a bit---this flick was shot for 4 million bucks. For 4 million bucks, Edgar Wright has conjured up a trillion times the ungodly flesh-eating slack-jawed glassy-eyed zombie horror that ""Resident Evil 2"" did---and *that* movie cost 10 times that much. Question: which flick delivered the most pure, unadulterated, zombie-brain-blasting goodness?

""Shaun of the Dead"" succeeds, largely, by animating more than just dead bodies. First off, don't believe the ""romantic comedy"" angle---yeah, Shaun has to square the circle with his lovey, but this is a brutal, no holds-barred, don't skimp on the Red Sauce and juicy intestines Captain kinda flick. It's intensely horrific, insanely gripping, and happily disgusting. I wasn't expecting that.

And best of all, this is one of the few zombie flicks that really burrow down into the guts of what it's like to have to put down someone you love: someone who's confused, who loved you, who tucked you into bed at night when you were a kid, who now exists for one thing and one thing only---to tear off the top of your scalp and sink her cancred yellow tusks into your brainpan. ""Shaun of the Dead"" brings it all home with a double-basrreled shotgun of dread, and for that I salute Edgar Wright.

But look: the real triumph of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is that it sets up a seamless, banal, everyday urban environment, and overruns it with pure horror. And you *believe* it. You are engaged: when Shaun and Ed (Nick Frost in priceless rat-faced X-Box playing slacker mode) confront a zombie in their backyard, they don't know what to do with the thing. Is she drunk? They laugh, up to the point where she bares her fangs and tries to give Shaun an impromptu tracheotomy.

Now: watch Shaun and Ed's reaction when they're putting their first zombie down. This is not irony: not humor: not comedy: it's pure, unadulterated horror and something more---and that something more is what fuels ""Shaun of the Dead"", and makes it the classic it is: it is a ferocious, angry sadness---indignation!---at the passing of the world they knew, the world of X-Box, Indian take-out, ruthless slacking, late-night binges, and drinking bouts at the Winchester. It's the end of the world as we know it, and we don't feel fine. To be honest, we feel murderous. Drink up, Mate, and pass the ammunition.",1101686400,12,5014,4.919526627218935

2106652,5,B0002MJT0I,"As one might expect, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a parodic remake of the classic George Romero film DAWN OF THE DEAD.  It pays frequent homage to the latter film through a host of direct references as well as its general subject matter (for instance, much of the ""news"" as read by the television presenters are lifted nearly word for word from Romero's script).  There differences are, however, marked.  Instead of an American location, this film is set in London.  And instead of holing up in a house to fight it out against the zombies, our heroes travel to a local pub.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed this film, there is no question that not everyone finds this film that funny.  I'm not sure why that is, but I thought it would be fun to bat around some theories about why the reactions have been so diverse.  This is an important exercise for prospective viewers.  Are you more likely to side with those who find this to be a highly effective and funny farce or those who simply don't find anything funny at all?  So here are my speculations:

First, I think some of those who do not like the movie failed to realize that this is an English comedy, with a very low-key, subdued approach to the story.  Before going to see this, I think a prospective viewer should answer is whether or not they enjoy MONTY PYTHON, Hugh Grant, THE OFFICE, and other British comic productions.  If the answer is ""Yes"" there is a high degree of probability that you will enjoy this one.  If the answer is ""Absolutely not!"" then you will almost certainly dislike this one.

Second, I think some people, hearing the basic premise, imagine that this is going to be a bit like SCARY MOVIE or some other such parody of a genre.  I know for a fact that the couple sitting behind me in the viewing I went to had expectations along these lines.  They were expecting more out and out farce, a more frenetic pace, and far more jokes and cartoonish humor.  But because SHAUN OF THE DEAD is more deliberately paced, allows the absurd tale to unfold gradually, and the jokes rationed out more gradually, they were truly upset.

I love British humor so I definitely fall more into the class of people apt to enjoy this.  I loved the pacing and subdued reactions of the main characters.  I loved, for instance, a pair of scenes that are allowed to unfold rather slowly.  The first occurs rather early in the movie when Shaun leaves his apartment and out of sheer habit walks across the street and down the sidewalk to the local corner store where he buys a couple of items.  The very same path is followed the next morning, with Shaun without thinking (almost zombie-like?) covers the same path to the store, utterly unaware of how dramatically everything has changed, of all the people he had seen the day before who had been transformed into zombies or been killed.  They were superbly executed scenes, and it is hard to imagine any American studio allowing a scene in a zombie comedy film to unfold so nicely.

There are many wonderful scenes in the film, some very short and some a bit longer.  I loved, for instance, the store employee who interrupted a meeting to accept a call on his cell phone.  Or the extraordinary scene later in the film when, to get through a group of zombies, the group of friends mimic the behavior of zombies in order to get past them.  Their rehearsing their imitations of zombies was one of the best scenes in the film.  Bill Nighy, who pretty much stole the show (despite being part of an ensemble cast) in LOVE ACTUALLY as the burned out rock musician, is in a number of nice moments in a regretfully small part.

I really loved the great teamwork between stars Simon Pegg and David Frost.  Both had worked together before on TV in SPACED, and Pegg co-wrote the screenplay with director Edgar Wright, also of SPACED.  The cast as a whole is quite strong, though I did find the character of David to be just a tad too irritating.

All in all, I really had a great time seeing this one and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.  But if overly broad, in-your-face American style farce along the lines of SCARY MOVIE is what you want, you'd better skip this one.",1100649600,7,4185,4.500662251655629
2106653,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is one of the better films to come out in 04.  The film is a romantic comedy..errr I think it is.  But what really matters is the comic humor in this film which I thought was brilliant the way they pulled it off.  I really enjoyed this film.  Acctually I enjoyed it better then The Dawn of the Dead remake.

The whole story is pretty funny to which I won't say since half the reviews all ready tell you about it.  But I will say this is one of my favorite films of 04 besides Kill Bill volume 2.  The characters are great especially Shaun's best bud Ed who causes more crap then you expect him to.  Also the film had some really good looking zombies.  I acctually liked the way they executed the zombies look it really did look awesome.  There are a few classic moments in Shaun of the Dead such as one part where they can't decide which kinds of Record cd's they should use to kill the zombies.  Really really funny.

Why a 4 star?  Well it's just that it looses it's touch near the end of the film which consists of a shotgun, Billions of zombies..and a pub.  It felt like watching any other Zombie film plus it go's from Funny as hell to kind of dead serious but the ending was still satisfying although I must say I had a kick out of that over exaggerated death scene near the end of the film which THEY GOT STRAIGHT OF DAWN OF THE DEAD, haha.

Over all I think you'll enjoy Shaun of the Dead and I'll be looking forward to getting the DVD.  The film is very funny and yet also creepy especially how they made the zombies look.

Funny, romantic, kind of serious near the end and just play Funny mayhem I give Shaun of the Dead

While it was funny, there was still something missing so we hopped over to the next theatre to see a film that we'd been hearing about at conventions: Shaun of the Dead. We had no expectations, only knew it was supposed to be a British comedy with zombies in it. It could have been very cheesy so we just sat there and and about half way through, we all realized this was one of the best character comedies we'd seen, one of the scariest films in a while and a truly heartfelt film about love and friendship. We were blown away and the fact that this film was dished over two hours of fun only made it that much better. This is a film that will be cherished for years. Give it a try, you might feel the same way I did.

As for the dvd, I know the region 2 dvd contains commentaries, deleted scenes and more so I am hoping all of those features will be brought overseas too.",1098748800,12,952,4.0638297872340425
2106663,5,B0002MJT0I,"It is a very hard line to cross in today's cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film. Normally, when this happens we end up with something like the Chucky series. It began serious, but after seeing the new preview, I know they have given up serious horror and invaded into the world of campy horror. I was afraid at first that this film was going to go into that direction, but then I remembered ... this film wasn't made in America, it was made in Britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny. As I was sitting and enjoying this film from beginning to end, I couldn't help but wonder why America has not been able to master this style of film yet. Why is our comedies still heavily based in the sex humor or bathroom jokes? While there were some in this film, I felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based. ""If you listen to the words, you will laugh at the jokes"" style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what first.

With its firm grasp on the comedy aspect, Shaun of the Dead delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity. It takes a lot of brain work to be able to think of a story about zombies where our main characters are oblivious to the fact that anything horrible is happening in the world until the second act. That was actually some of my favorite parts of this film. I was there, sitting in the theater, knowing that it was a zombie film (still, can I call it that?), and nearly missing the entire zombie clues going on in the background. My eyes were focused directly on our star and scene-stealer duo, Shaun and Ed. One of my favorite scenes of this film is when Shaun is going to work after the dead have risen and goes through the motions as if nothing strange is happening while there is chaos and destruction all around. How many of us have gone to work and not even noticed anything-different happening in our daily routine. Sometimes we get so caught up in the motion that we miss any different actions. I couldn't stop laughing.

What also made this film work on every level was the cast. Director Edgar Wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters. They were each believable in their own part, and I loved every scene with Bill Nighy. He was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film. That is another great aspect of this film. It was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment. So many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of people's minds. This wasn't happening in this film. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, so I couldn't play favorites. All I could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everything.

I would like to end with the comment that this is still a zombie film. It is a love story surrounding a zombie film where the director has chosen to emphasize the love story instead of blowing everything up. I know that sounds strange, but you will get used to it American viewers. I mention that it is still a zombie film because I do not want people going thinking that this is a spoof. While it does pay homage to several of the classic horror films, this film stands on its own two feet. It had blood, it has violence, and it has those infamous scenes of people's heads being blown apart. That is why we see zombie films.

Overall, if you love zombie films and you are a fan of The Office or any Hugh Grant film, than Shaun of the Dead will appeal to you. I don't remember the last time I witnessed such a creative film.

After the movie was over, I was glad that I brought friends in a sort of ""mysery loves company"" kind of way.  Each of us thought the movie failed to produce the comedic value anticipated.

The night before watching the movie, my friends and I rented ""Dawn of the Dead"" in order to understand any spoof-like jokes in ""Shaun.""  And for that all I got was about 15 bucks down the drain, a few chuckles, and the experience of watching two below average zombie movies.

2106666,4,B0002MJT0I,"In its own way, this film is a minor classic already. It has created a whole new genre; the zombie comedy. Zombies, of course, have always been kind of humorous, with their shuffling, growling, and slowness. Of all the monsters to have to deal with, one gets the feeling that zombies would be the easiest to dispatch. A zany group of Brits, who have all worked together previously on British television, have put together a film that combines the bawdy and the bizarre; a kind of dead-pan English humor meets graphic gore Fest; a kind of Benny Hill meets George Romero in a pub and they hatch a plot.

The primary writer was Simon Pegg, who also played Shaun. The script was very clever, full of pathos and pratfalls, and it was as much a social commentary as it was comedic. There is a depiction of the English Everyman that is leaden-eyed, drooling dumbly, a populous slogging through their gray lives barely breathing; vacuous, desensitized, barely breathing. They are slaves to their daily routines, lurching home after working at a job they detested to their identical row houses. It took people a while to even notice that the undead were walking among them.
There was a distinct Thames TV feel to the movie. I half expected Rowen Atkinson, Stephen Fry, or John Cleese to pop in.

Pegg, as Shaun, worked in an appliance store. He would shuffle through his boring day, and then race off to the pub at night. On weekends, of course, he would get serious about his drinking. His pub of choice was the Winchester, named after the American rifle and not its British heritage. Shaun's best friend, and primary roommate, was Ed, played by Nick Frost. Ed spent most of his time playing video games, eating junk food, drinking beer, selling the odd weed or drugs, and waiting to meet Shaun at the Winchester. He was uncouth, boorish, and a bit loveable.

Kate Ashfield played Liz, Shaun's longtime girlfriend. She wanted to break up with him. She was tired of the same old routines. She wanted to dump him and move on. There was only one complication; a zombie infestation. Bill Nighy played Phillip, Shaun's stepfather, and Penelope Wilson played Shaun's ""Mum"". They were quite effective, and almost stole every scene they were in. Nighy is a great character actor, and he did especially well.

There were several poignant scenes mixed in with the comic mayhem. Pegg played the scenes emotionally bang on. He is a fine actor. Wisely, he never played Shaun as a caricature. Shaun, as a character, could have stepped off the pages of a Harold Pinter or a Tom Stoppard script. Shockingly, mixed in with the comic elements of killing zombies with cricket bats and gold clubs, many of the scenes of gore were quite graphic; equal to the zombie thrills in Danny Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER. In a way, this film was made as an answer to that film. Initially, the zombies were less a threat than an inconvenience, and interference in the drinking bouts. Forting up at the Winchester was absurd, but it was the only ""logical"" choice Shaun and Ed could come up with.

I liked this film. After all, how many zombie films quote Bertrand Russell? I think it will be a candidate for cult status.",1098403200,,3173,4.67921146953405

In the previews they don't really sound british so I guess it was a shock to me.

The plot of Shaun of the Dead is actually pretty good, wich is another shocker to me as well. Shaun who is played by Simon Pegg, his character is sort of the serious one who just wants to get the job done, but his friend Ed (Nick Frost) is the complete opposite of Shaun. Ed is that friend you have who never takes anything seriously and tries to make everything fun. Every night Shaun and Ed head down to the Winchester, a local club where they always go but then Shaun's relationship with his girlfriend Liz, portrayed by Kate Ashfield falls apart from that scene. As Shaun's personal life falls into pieces, the apocalypse comes and turns thousands of England's community into mind eating zombies.

2106672,5,B0002MJT0I,"For some horror fans, satirizing the zombie genre (and let's face it, zombie films are practically a genre unto themselves) could seem like sacrilege. With the serious films that have come before - 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, and, of course, Night of the Living Dead - SHAUN OF THE DEAD leads us down a path few have dared tread (Evil Dead fans should check out this film to see how a REAL spoof is pulled off). Leave it to the British to give us some gritty dialogue and bloody comedy all rolled into one. I, for one, say ""thank you.""

So what's this film all about ...

Shaun (Simon Pegg) leads a dull and mundane lifestyle; he works at an electronics store as a salesman, lives with a flatulently impaired and obese roommate named Ed (Nick Frost) and a second roommate, Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), who can't stand Ed. Shaun also has a girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), who is suffering with him over his complete lack of motivation to accomplish anything in his life. And she's right. Shaun doesn't seem to notice the zombie-esque lifestyle he leads, the terrible routine of drinking at `The Winchester' pub (named after the rifle that gleams over the bar), the protecting of Ed's horrific behavior (ripping farts and calling women the ""C"" word while never maintaining a job of any kind), and, of course, his forgetfulness that she, Liz, is actually a part of his life. So naturally she calls off their relationship, causing Shaun and Ed to go on a drinking spree and video game holiday. And when they awaken from the alcoholic stupor, some things have changed. Only Shaun and Ed don't notice right away. They're so used to life being slow, boring, and ...er ...well, shuffling, that they don't take notice of the cars burning on the street, blood on the grocery store floor, or the vacant gaze of their neighbors. This is where the comedy really starts to take wing for the film.

When a ""true"" zombie wanders into their backyard, Shaun and Ed just think she's drunk. But they quickly discover that this ...thing ...can't be killed. And she is soon joined by another, much larger zombie. Shaun and Ed have entered the apocalypse. But what do you use to defend yourself in a country (let's remember, we're in England here) where guns are not readily available? Initially, they throw everything they can find at these shuffling monstrosities, but nothing seems to work (even Shaun's old record collection, which is hilariously pulled off as they try to decide which records to throw at the undead and which to save: ""Stone Roses?"" ""No!"" ""Second Coming?"" ""I liked it."" ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it.""). Shaun finally picks up a cricket paddle and uses it to bash in the brains of the undead, thus ending their life-after-life existence.

A race to save everyone that Shaun loves soon ensues, and this includes his roommates, Ed and Pete, his girlfriend, Liz, and his mom and stepdad. But where to hide out until this has ""blown over"". Ah! Of course! The Winchester pub!

What follows is truly hysterical. Shaun must deal with the fact that Pete, his other roommate, has been bitten by a zombie. He also soon discovers that his stepfather (who he never really cared for anyway) was bitten, too. ""All right, dude! We can drive his Jaguar!"" Ed exclaims happily.

Once all of Shaun's loved one's have been gathered together, they have to make their way to the pub; but first they have to pass through a shuffling maze of zombies. They do this through some wonderful trial and error (from bashing in the head of every zombie in sight with the cricket paddle, to shuffling and moaning like zombies to fake them out. I mean, they're zombies for cryin' out loud! They ain't that smart.). Is the pub the place to go? Can Shaun, who's life has been pretty much meaningless up to this point, actually give meaning to it by saving all those whom he cares for?

The thing that helps this film stand out above other spoofs is that it doesn't dismiss the zombie-genre, but instead respects it and utilizes it to great comedic advantage. It's not slapstick, nor bathroom humor (although there is a touch of this thanks to Ed's bowels), but a set of coarse narratives and script that pulls the viewer into these characters lives and forces us to live with them. Most of us have seen, or have family members who are, in some way, these stereotypical losers. You can't help but cheer them on and hope that they survive their own failings. And that's where SHAUN OF THE DEAD gives you the emotional umpf! that you need to enjoy the movie. You care about them and laugh at their ridiculous inadequacies, both at the same time.

This is truly a great film. A+ ...especially for creativity.",1097452800,249,4667,4.662211421628189

2106674,5,B0002MJT0I,"The zombie genre has been done to (ahem) death by now.  Sam Raimi proved that it could be a successful vehicle for launching more expensive films with Evil Dead.  Since then, there's been an endless array of less engaging imitators, often confusing gore with content.

Zombie movies can be summed up in exactly the same way. The difference is in the inflection.  Don't believe me?  Let me demonstrate...

ZOMBIE TROPE #1: ""Zombie movies are about SHAMBLING dead people.""  These zombie movies laugh at the absolute absurdity of the walking dead.  I mean, they're dead and they stumble around like DRUNK people for crying out loud!  How can you take anything serious that moans like an overly hormonal teenager on prom night, lolls its head to the side like a Valley girl, and can't even walk in a straight line?  Zombies definitely have a lot of humor potential, as established in Evil Dead II.  The shamble is one of the primary reasons that modern zombie movies have made their zombies move quickly-it's hard to take slow moving zombies seriously.

ZOMBIE TROPE #2: ""Zombie movies are about shambling DEAD people.""  These zombie movies concentrate on the horrors of what it means to have corpses trying to eat you.  It is visceral and disgusting.  There is gore (dead bodies are gross) and decay.  These zombies are rotting and, thanks to the magic of special effects, really do look like exhumed corpses.  This is just about every zombie movie that takes itself seriously without devolving into camp.

ZOMBIE TROPE #3: ""Zombie movies are about shambling dead PEOPLE.""  These zombie movies aren't about the zombies.  They're about how people react to the fact that people they knew who were dead are walking around trying to eat other people.  The presence of zombies causes people to freak out.  Some folks are barely over their mourning when their spouses and children rise up to attack them.  It's enough to make a person snap.  It's also George Romero's specialty, a topic he has extensively covered in the Living Dead series.

Recent zombie movies have been combinations of these three attributes, but rarely in equal balance. Shaun of the Dead?  It's all three.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) is the hero of the title, a fellow who has long since exited the swinging college years and entered into the stale, zombie-like grind of a working man.  He is a man out of time, frozen in his own routines.  He still lives with his two flatmates, Ed (Nick Frost), the fat, funny one and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), the smart, successful one.  Shaun is trapped, unable to go back to the good old days of no responsibility and unwilling to go forward with his relationship to his blonde girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).

Meanwhile, ambulances start popping up in the background, carting away twitching body bags.

The outcome of their situation is an inevitability that we've all witnessed before: Liz has had enough.  She doesn't want to keep going to the same old pub every night: the Winchester, named after the rifle on the wall.  She hates Shaun's best friend Ed, who is an offensive boor.  And Shaun hates Liz's good friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran).  As it turns out, David used to date Liz and just tolerates Dianne so he can be near her.

Meanwhile, paramilitary vehicles drive by and newscasters report troubling news about some sort of plague.

And oh yeah, Shaun loves his mum (Nicola Cunningham) and hates his step-dad, Philip (Bill Nighy), a perpetually frowning robot of a man whose face has been untouched by any other expression.

When Liz finally gets sick of Shaun, his world falls apart. He goes on a drunken binge with Ed, blasting music, playing video games, and shutting out the world around him.  In essence, Shaun's life has finally gone out of joint and he desperately regresses to deal with it.  Unfortunately for Shaun (and everyone else in that part of England), the world has also literally fallen apart.

A large part of the humor is how Shaun and his compatriots deal with the undead.  It takes a very long time for him to even notice; after all, who would really notice slow moving people?  The director, Edgar Wright, gleefully makes this point at every turn.  At first, the zombies are just the homeless, who everybody ignores and expects to act strangely.  Then, it's people in menial jobs that have a glazed look as they go about their drudgery.  It's not until a zombie actually shows up on their doorstep that anybody gets concerned.  Even then, they figure the zombie is just really, really drunk.

Once Shaun and Ed come to grips with the situation, they devise a plan.  Their plans are highly unrealistic, but mostly involve beating on zombies with clubs (remember, no guns in England), rescuing girlfriends and mums, and holing up in the Winchester, ""cause it's the safest place.""  That's right, the one place Liz doesn't want to be with the people she really doesn't want to be with.

Shaun of the Dead embraces all the zombie tropes, and then rips their guts out.  Sure, the movie seems to say, it's easy to get around slow moving zombies.  But eventually they catch up with you.  Sure, smashing a zombie's head in sounds easy...until it's a family member.  Sure, shooting a zombie with a rifle should give you the upper hand...unless you've never actually shot a gun before.

In the mean time, Shaun deals with his issues with his step-dad, introduces his girlfriend to his mom, meets an ex-girlfriend (who seems to be far more capable than Liz), finally gets tired of drug-dealing Ed's antics, and slowly realizes just how fragile his humdrum life is.  It seems to encapsulate his mom, Liz, and Ed at first, but Shaun discovers that his circle of family and friends extends to more people than he thought.

This movie is deadly earnest about everything, including its humor. It has traumatizing gore, hysterical in-jokes, and weep-worthy moments of true drama.  All of it is pulled off with incredible aplomb by the cast, who have to do everything from beat on zombies to act like zombies (no, really) to finally going utterly ballistic like real human beings.

Shaun of the Dead is the culmination of dozens of zombie movies that have gone before it.  It succeeds because it focuses on the people, gives shambling corpses the respect they deserve (which is to say, very little and a lot, depending on the scene), and dramatizes the horror of dead people coming back to a tortured semi-existence.

No self-respecting horror fan should miss this movie.",1097193600,35,6501,4.811371841155235
2106675,4,B0002MJT0I,"Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests. Like poor Dracula, they have nothing much to say. But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny ""Shaun of the Dead,"" a tale of music, love, and the slobbering undead. Fans of Peter Jackson's early splatter gore flicks should check it out.

Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).

Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub. Where else?

""Shaun"" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. One funny detail is that since in the U.K., guns are pretty much nonexistant. So beat off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. And music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? ""Stone Roses?"" ""No."" ""...Second Coming?"" ""I liked it."" ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.

The script's humor comes from its slacker heroes, who seem befuddled by the idea of being adults. Shaun's boneheaded obliviously is hysterical, as he blandly goes to work without noticing the horror around him. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.

Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how. Frost is a good sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend. Shaun's parents are a bit cliched (whines of why-don't-you-ever-visit?), and not nearly as interesting.

While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, ""Shaun of the Dead"" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, dead.",1097020800,6,2623,4.95
2106676,4,B0002MJT0I,"Shaun of the Dead is not the first zombie-comedy ever made.  There have been the Evil Dead movies and the Return of the Living Dead movies.  This is the next in a proud tradition.  Does it make mistakes?  Yes.  It is a very hard line to skate between horror and comedy and, towards the end, it goes astray a bit in the wrong direction.  Is it worth seeing?  If you are a fan of zombie movies, YES!!!

There is much to admire about the film.  First off, it brings a very British sense of humor to the characters.  It's a bit like seeing the cast of The Office in a horror movie.  What's really great about the movie is that it doesn't waste our time with explanations - it knows that the audience is all ready familiar with the conventions of the genre.  The gimmick of this film is that it feels as if filmmakers picked an extra in Dawn of the Dead and decided to tell his story.  We see Shaun walking through the streets of London, quite oblivious to the fact that the dead have risen and society has crumbled.  We know zombies can only be killed by a blow to the head, but what to hit them with?

Zombie films are some of my favorite horror movies and I am grateful that they have made a comeback in recent years.  At least in Shaun of the Dead, the zombies still move slowly.",1097020800,4,1278,4.155102040816327
2106677,5,B0002MJT0I,"""Shaun of the Dead"" (SotD) has been hyped by the AICN pundits for some time before its actual release.  Although I don't always buy into their raves, this was an exception.  I can't resist apocalyptic movies, especially when zombies are involved (and I don't care if they are Slow or Fast, if you get my drift.  Each type has their respective merits).  Of course, three things must occur to prevent disappointment with any zombie movie: 1) good story, 2) cool characters, and 3) mayhem - lots of mayhem.  SotD has all three, and done well enough so I'd pay to see the movie again.

The plot of SotD is somewhat typical - ordinary people are caught up in extraordinary events, and they must rise to the occasion or die.  Nothing original about that, but this time the execution is superb.  As other critics have noted, this movie works on many levels, and all of them combine to more than satisfy my three requirements listed above.  A couple things in particular stand out:

First, the humor is superlative, and I can't rave enough about it.  There's plenty of in-joke references to past zombie movies, from the original Romero ""Dead"" trilogy to last year's ""28 Days Later.""  In addition, the humorous aspects of horror conventions are explored without insulting them.  For example, the whole ""kill a zombie by killing the brain"" staple is exploited for laughs in a country where personal gun ownership is almost non-existent.  Thankfully, us Yanks will never have to rely on cricket bats and vinyl Sade albums to rid our backyards of zombies.  The number of laugh-out-loud moments alone are enough to recommend this flick.

Second, the horror aspect is well done. As any genre fan knows, gore is a zombie-movie staple (normally gore is not my thing, but hey - you can't have a self-respecting zombie movie without it, for heaven's sake).  What do you expect, with cannibalistic reanimated corpses that can only be stopped by extreme methods?  SotD delivers plenty of gruesome human-zombie interactions, particularly during the climactic last stand at Shaun's beloved Winchester pub.  And more importantly, Slow Zombie purists the world over will finally get their due, after being ignored by recent films that favored the quicker and more agile zombie variant.

Finally, the relationships between the characters and their personal struggles ring true, and will appeal to any self-respecting Gen-Xer.  Shaun is the prototypical ""male struggling against manhood"" character, trying to hold off the twin devils of responsibility and purpose for as long as possible.  His crisis transformation from slacker to savior is nicely done.  The chemistry between the main characters is spot-on, and it didn't take long for me to identify with them and care about their fates.  A good portion of the comedy results from their interactions, especially between Shaun and his slovenly roommate/best friend Ed.  However, there are also moments of genuine feeling, as when Shaun and his long-despised stepfather have their final exchange.  Indeed, the actors are the real reason this movie works, and without exception they do a commendable job.

The last two years have seen a welcome resurgence of the zombie genre, with ""28 Days Later"", the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, and now the excellent ""Shaun of the Dead.""  Get all three for your horror library, and prepare for the day when there's no more room in hell (or pub).",1097020800,23,3404,4.98758865248227

2106680,4,B0002MJT0I,"In the middle of the British contemporary society Shaun (Simon Pegg) works for a small electronic company in order to make enough money for the weekend and rent. Shaun does not have any dreams or expectations on life more than walking down to the Winchester, the local pub, and gulping a pint of beer. This is something that annoys and bores his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), as she gives Shaun one final ultimatum to change his life perspective and do something with his life. This is easier said than done as Shaun quickly realizes when Liz drops him like a bad habit.

Troubled Shaun tries to find a way to fix his relationship with Liz, but it is all in vane as she wants nothing to do with him. In the backdrop of Shaun's love issues he misses crucial news, as he usually does, relating human attacks on other humans are taking place where they try to bite or eat each other. Instead Shaun and his best friend, the freeloader Ed (Nick Frost), who spend the days at Shaun's place playing video games, go to the Winchester to drown their sorrows. Simultaneously as London is stricken by an outbreak of zombies, Shaun gets drunk, works on his hangover, and goes to the local convenient store for a soda. Shaun's first contact with the zombies is hilarious as they assume that the person is excessively drunk as the zombie is moaning and stumbling towards them. However, when the two slackers are attacked, the film turns both gory and bloody. This could affect some of the audience as it sometimes is brutal, yet amusing. For example, Shaun and Ed try to kill the zombies with vinyl records by throwing them at their heads while deciding what record to throw and what record to keep.

Shaun of the Dead is a horror film that exploits horror with a crude level of comedy as the lazy attitude of Shaun and Ed infects the audience with belly aching humor. The humor is very real as many know and recognize Shaun and Ed in people they know, or in themselves. The love story between Liz and Shaun is also an element that brings further amusement to the audience as it is something to which the audience can relate. The ingredients that surround Shaun spice up the horror with a philosophy, or maybe a lack of, to which most viewers can connect. It is this connection with the audience that enhances the cinematic experience of the film. Ultimately, the comedy and horror bring together a light cinematic event, which should be enjoyed as it offers something for everyone.",1096416000,8,2471,4.600907029478458
2106681,4,B0002MJT0I,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is the story of a sad sack, heart-of-gold, barely employed, forever a teenager guy named Shaun, who through no fault of his own, becomes a Zombie killer. Think the irreverence of ""Buffy"" mixed with deadly seriousness of ""28 Days Later"" and you'll begin to get the picture.

Shaun and his Buddy and room mate, Ed like nothing better than to spend an entire day drinking beer at the local pub, The Winchester, listening to ""Electro"" music and generally being slacked and blissed out. They're dissolute, but fun: without a care in the world. Then The Zombies arrive.

In perhaps the funniest scene in the film, a fuzzy from the night before, Shaun and Ed spy a women, who is moaning and generally acting strangely, standing in their garden. Being the sophisticated blokes that they are, they proceed to try to rid themselves of this intruder by pelting her with all manner of kitchen utensil. Classic!

Towards the end, ""Shaun of the Dead"" gets a little weepy and serious for its own good but all in all, director Edgar Wright, tongue deeply and bloodily stuck in his cheek, keeps things moving along swiftly and wittily and its fun too see the trademark British stiff upper lip get bruised a little.",1096416000,4,1217,4.704225352112676

Sometimes you wanna watch two nice people fall in love, and if you're like me you wanna watch zombies rip people apart.  But sometimes when you go to the movies don't you just long to see a romantic comedy in which Zombies rip people apart?  Fear not reader, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is the film for you.

SHAUN OF THE DEAD follows our hero Shaun (Simon Pegg, 24 Hour Party People) on journey to win back his girl Liz (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office), make amends with his Mom (Nicola Cunningham), and to fight off a small London Suburb of Zombies.  Shaun enlists the help of his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost, TV's SPACED), and Dianne (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office) and David (Dylan Moran, Notting Hill) Liz's two best friends, who don't seem to like Shaun Very Much, but they follow him anyway cause Liz follows Shaun.  It's all very complicated but once you let the characters take hold, this film is a trip.

Director Edgar Wright (TV's Spaced) has crafted a silly and yet surprisingly rich film.  Full of characters worth rooting for, gore that harkens back to a simpler time when it was okay to disembowel in horror flicks, and conflicts that enlighten our characters with humanity. It's a film about how mundane and Zombie-like our lives are, and about our search for that hero inside. But more importantly the film is about being funny.  Laugh out loud, gutt-busting, funny.

Pegg's Shaun hits the right chords as a guy who wants more out of his life, but is drawn back into his slacker existence because he doesn't know any better.  He's every Tom, Dick, and Harry who looks at themselves 10 years after graduating from college and wondering, ""how did I get here?""  That's easy he's been sticking up for a buddy who has as much drive as a broken down Ford Pinto and that's what makes him a great hero, he's empathetic to a fault.

But most are probably wondering what about the Zombies.  SHAUN OF THE DEAD works because the screenplay loves the material.  As screenwriter's as well,  Pegg and Wright don't allow the material to become mean spirited.  They love the Zombie movie.  I'll bet they sat up many late nights watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD over and over.  There's even a small wink at 28 DAYS LATER won't fall on deaf ears.  They know the material well and walk the thin line between spoof and homage, to a nice degree.

The best scene in the film concerns one characters death, by being bitten by a Zombie.  Nobody wants to shoot that character (who will eventually become one of the undead) and they're torn on both sides.  A showdown of broken bottles and a corkscrew, tests the characters will, and in the end brings them closer together.  The scene works because there is real tension.  Although this is a comedy, these characters are in peril.  It was exhilarating.

The film's only major flaw is that it takes far too long to get started.  The first twenty minutes drag on like they were being paid by the minute.  The laughs at the beginning seemed to be forced and if I'd left before the Zombies begin to show up I might have panned the movie as boring.  But once the Zombies show up the film comes to life with really good laughs, and even a few good scares chucked in for measure.  SHAUN OF THE DEAD would have done well to have had the early moments of the film reimagined or shaved a little.  But I'll forgive the film this one small flaw.  I really liked it.

At the end of the day though the most surprising thing about SHAUN OF THE DEAD is what its not.  It's not a Horror film.  It's a Romantic Comedy, turned on its head and it works almost flawlessly.  In fact my wife called it ""FORCES OF NATURE with Zombies (instead of weather).""  I don't know if I'd go that far but I will agree that there is a little romance for the lady in your life.

If you're looking for something a little different, if you're looking for a silly movie with heart, or you like to watch people get ripped apart limb from limb.  SHAUN OF THE DEAD does not disappoint, I promise you'll like it.

It's funny. One of the best comedies i've ever seen.

This movie finally shows everyone what I have always believed. You can live your life in a world of walking zombies. They cannot get you. Also, it shows another thing that I believe. The world can handle slow zombies. They can get it under control. Fast zombies, probably not. Slow zombies, yes.

The movie begins by showing us the disaster that is Shaun's love-life. After forgetting to make a reservation, his girlfriend brakes up with him. This is where we get into this funny scene where Shaun walking through the town and doesn't realize everyone has become a zombie. Walks through the town, goes to the store, gets a beer, goes home, doesn't notice a thing.

Lots of good comedy in this movie. That, of course, is until they get into the pub. This is where they go from being new, a zombie movie the world has never seen before, into a regular zombie movie. It became humans vs the zombies. The zombies are outside, we're in here, they're breaking in, let's get out. It was all good until they got into the pub. It dropped the comedy thing for a while.

The comedy comes back. So this is on the top three on my favorite zombie movies list.

This movie had a lot more blood and gore than I ever expected it to. Some parts where a few people were a little disgusted, like the falling on the pole, but there is only one thing I can say about the part where they rip the guy open(the guy that, i think, looks like that Harry Potter kid). 26 years later, it still looks cheesy.

1.)""Dawn of the Dead 2004""(17 movies later, this is still the best)
2.)""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""(great)
3.)""Shaun of the Dead""(a lot better than I could have expected)
(I don't like comedies very much)

I just want to add something in here. To all the Brits that say Americans make crappy comedies because they are nothing but fart jokes and Brits make great comedies because they don't do fart jokes. This movie had fart jokes. So shut up. American comedies are good to, just not the ones done by idiots like ""Scary Movie"". Also, the Brits also have their own joke they always do that I find pretty stupid. It's when they do that stupid thing where they change to another scene and the guy in that scene finishes the sentance for the guy in the other scene. I just don't find it funny.

Someone asked if George Romero was going to work with the guys who made this movie to make the best zombie movie of all time. If George Romero is going to be part of it, then it is going to be a terrible movie. Everything he's done is crap. The only one that I found entertaining(3 stars entertaining) was ""Creepshow"". Romero's fourth movie is going to suck.

Question-
Where the hell are all those people that say everything is a rip-off of that crappy movie ""28 Days Later""? I mean, they were there when ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" came out. They said it was nothing but rip-off of ""28 Days Later"" even though it wasn't. Then they said ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" was a rip-off of ""28 Days Later"". Wasn't anybody listening when we said ""28 Crappy Days Later"" was a rip-off of ""Resident Evil""? The whole blocking off the city thing in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" came from ""Resident Evil 2"" which came out in the 90's. Where are the people to say this is a rip-off of ""28 Days Later""? Where the hell are you people?

One more thing. Shaun needs to get some kind of air freshener if he's going to keep Ed.",1096156800,2,3453,4.405023547880691
2106686,5,B0002MJT0I,"Zombie films have made sort of a mini-comeback in recent years, and each amd every one of them is terrible.  These films either have running, jumping and galloping zombies(28 Days Later), crappy Matrix-like techno zombies(Resident Evil, House Of The Dead) or just flat out rape Romero's good name(Dawn Of The Dead remake).  We haven't had a really good zombie movie since O""Bannon's Return Of The Living Dead in 1984.  That's a long time.  Well, Dead Alive was cool too.  Ok fine, Cemetery Man was also good.  Shaun Of The Dead is British comedy's take on Romero, and it's actually very good.  The film is quite funny with some Python-esque moments, but is also able to screetch to a halt to deliver a few scenes that might actually get you a little misty eyed(!).  I have seen very few movies that can do that.  The comedy is hit and miss depending on your sense of humor.  There's some very clever jokes, but a few Dude, Where's My Car? kind as well.  The film never gets very scary, but the film makers obviously know the classic zombie flicks and like them, unlike Paul Anderson or Zack Snyder.  Most newer zombie flicks like to steal ideas and sometimes entire scenes from Romero's films to push their story.  I guess they figure the general public will never catch on, and they won't.  Us zombie fanatics know better.  Shaun also does this, but in the same way Mel Brooks does in his films-as a spoof/homage.  Granted, most people won't pick up on these either, but it shows the film maker's knowledge and respect for the film's roots.  This movie is bound by the R rating which keeps it from being an all out gorefest like the classic zombie films, but it pushes the gore to it's limit.  In fact, there's one scene that could have come straight from a Romero or Fulci film that I'm shocked made it by the censors.  Especially when we're talking about England here.  There are two zombie films playing in the theaters as of now.  DO NOT feed that rotten wannabe RE franchise and check out Shaun.  You may have to go out of your way to find a theater playing it, coz big chains cater to crap, but it'll be worth the trip and the cash.",1096070400,6,2139,4.4728682170542635
2106687,4,B0002MJT0I,"Good movie, and especially since it wasn't done by Americans (which they surely would have ruined it!)...The last scene in the movie before closing credits is something I would have expected 'Hollywood' to do, so I could have done without it....Some silly and stupid parts ( that's why I went to see it!) with minimal gore for those worried about that. A good British spoof on the zombie movie genre...Americans did an okay job with the 'Return Of The Living Dead' series back in the 80's, so if you enjoy those, you might also like this (as someone else also mentioned here in one of the reviews of this film)...May be a bit slow for some people...Still worth checking out! It's not Lucio Fulci or George Romero at work here, so don't expect anything remotely like their previous work in this film...(Sorry if this review appeared twice! :^))",1096070400,3,843,4.702702702702703
2106688,5,B0002MJT0I,"All of those halves add up to so much of a total movie viewing experience, it is incredible. If you enjoy snarky drunk video game playing slacker humor, this is for you. If you like to see parallels between ""zombie-like"" activity (from everyone using cellphones and wearing business suits, to all those skaters wearing hoodies and bouncing in step to their portable cd-players) and actual zombie activity, it's for you. If you love great dialogue almost always with a touch of humor, and can wait for set-up in the beginning of the film to establish real character relationships before they start kickin' some serious zombie ass--I repeat, this is for you. I absolutely love this film and it's main characters, there are some hard sad scenes but since they are mixed with gore, it's harder to get too depressed over them...

2106689,5,B0002MJT0I,"I just got back from seeing this film and it was even better than I expected, and I had high hopes to begin with. Simon Pegg as Shaun is brilliant and Nick Frost as his best bud gets some great lines to go along with his loser attitude. The British humor here really works and if you want some great gore effects this film is for you. That scene towards the end when the zombies get a hold of ""four eyes"" in the pub, will bring back those gross memories of the Captain in ""Day of the Dead"" being pulled to pieces...Yuck! I would easily rank this film up there with Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" and Romero's ""Dead Trilogy"" and in my opinion surpasses those in many ways. I will be buying this import DVD soon, because I can't wait four months or so to see it again at home.

In general is an ok flick, it has its moments, but this should not be called one of the best ones, no way. It could've been better. 3 out of 5 stars.",1095984000,2,424,3.8295454545454546

Came in the mail couple weeks ago,waited till it got dark,turn the lights off and poped in the DVD.And I have to say this is the best horror comedy I have ever scene. I laughed so hard during the whole movie. And unlike the gorelest Resident Evil,Shaun of the Dead delevers in the gore department.

2106692,3,B0002MJT0I,"As an American who knows a few things about British culture, I did enjoy ""Shaun of the Dead"", but at the same time it did to me the same thing the Dawn of the Dead remake did: I want another George Romero movie. Now.

For as much British humor that was supposed to be in the film, it really seemed like a contemporary American comedy for most of the start. It's the same pop culture reference name dropping brand of humor that has developed over here in the last 10 or so years. For instance the ""White Lines"" scene... that could've been in a Kevin Smith movie. The drunk girl zombie in the garden is pure ""Dude Where's My Car"". The middle and end of the movie play like ""From Dusk till Dawn"". The movie's pace and tone suddenly change direction into a hard core fright fest leaving the comdey way behind. Until the last five minutes again.

While it's all very amusing it's more like a ""Oh yeah, that was clever"" laugh you'll get out of it. You won't be falling off your chair. I'm sorry, but just because you pay homage to great films of the past doesn't make your film better. Well, there is one case where that worked (See: Once Upon a Time in the West). This isn't in that league.

The beauty of this flick is the way everything is so well balanced - humour with horror, light with dark, belly out laughs and nervous chuckles.

The writing really is faultless and follows the same subversive elements as seen in their TV series, Spaced, but neatly re-delivered here within a well trodden genre that is just ripe for parody.
