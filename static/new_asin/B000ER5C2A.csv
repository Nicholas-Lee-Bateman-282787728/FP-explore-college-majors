8113547,5,B000ER5C2A,I saw this movie twice.  I have been yearning to see it again and look forward to it coming on regular DVD (NTSC???)It is a great movie I think to be enjoyed by all ages and cultures.  West Indians and other immigrants will certainly be able to relate to a lot of the scenes and scenarios.,1160524800,2,289,4.142857142857143
8113548,4,B000ER5C2A,"this movie wants me to change the world.yes, change the world. change all that is supposedly right in it. The gap between rich and poor, male and female, black or white.

It fills me with wonder...at how beautiful and poiganant life can be. and is.

It also terrifies me because i relise how caught up we are in the ""race to make big"".

every scene, word, character speaks to me.

my favourite scene is when the black child girl comes to the birthday party of the white boy whom she plays cricket with,

how he is embarrased to be with her. That is my world.

What happens henceforth in the film ,gives me hope.

It speaks of a world that is safe. secure.sound.

sadly ,this isn't our world.

but the film gives me hope.it can be

we can fill this world with wonder.

we too, make a difference.

we too, can change the world.",1156809600,2,825,4.285714285714286
