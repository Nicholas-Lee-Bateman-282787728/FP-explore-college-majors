4319921,5,B004BO8JAO,I bought this for my husband's birthday.  He is already playing the piano.  We are very happy with this purchase.,1403568000,7,113,4.6
4319922,4,B004BO8JAO,"i am working my way through the course.  Got the books and cds but not the dvds, cost of $100, well worth it compared to others I checked out on line and libraries.
cds and books make a good pairing.  Nice fun rhythms right off the bat, like LEAN ON ME.

I think I can learn a lot on my own with this course and after I have the basics I will pay $25-35/half hour for instruction.
at that price I would have $1200 a year in instruction just to learn basic cords, fake book playing, etc. which I can learn on my own.
I have fake christmas, classic and jumbo books, as well as dummies.
 This course is more like instruction so it is organized learning and I still spend time on SONGS per se, Canon in D, fur elise intro, winter and Christmas songs, Going Home, etc. as well as 72 basic cords and their inversions.",1394323200,10,811,4.113924050632911
4319923,4,B004BO8JAO,"After considerable searching for software to learning  piano for my better half this seem tobe the lodgical choice to pick.
Item was as listed, good communication, and shipping was at the right price",1391385600,,199,5.03030303030303
4319924,5,B004BO8JAO,"Looks to be very good teaching course, but do get the Workshop add on DVDs.
As with workshop DVDs these work fine on any modern DVD drive.
I use them on my UK Laptop and play them on my UK TV both work fine.",1389744000,2,207,3.727272727272727
4319925,3,B004BO8JAO,"As a whole, I think this is a pretty good product. The lessons are pretty straight forward and easy to follow (until about lesson 12 - then there is a huge leap in skill level). I took piano lessons all growing up, so I bought the course to try to get back into playing the piano. I'm definitely learning a lot along the way, but I don't find this method specifically helpful for a number of reasons:

1) Instead of focusing on what you should be learning, the instructor often shows off his professional skills instead of really teaching you the basic skills of the piano.

2) Beyond the basic clefs and the notes associated with the two clefs, he really doesn't talk about reading notes that go off the clef, but we end up playing a lot of those notes.

3) Once you get to the advanced units, you really need an 88-key piano. I was playing on a Casio 61-key, so I've had to adjust a few things here and there.

4) There are times when the instructor is almost painfully slow, and then there are times when he goes very fast. It's almost as if he's unsure how to actually pace the course effectively. I really started noticing this in Lesson #12. He starts using more advanced chord positions and often doesn't spend the amount of time necessary really showing you how to finger the chords. I've found it more useful to read the instruction booklet and figure out the chords prior to watching the DVDs.

AND NOW, MY BIGGEST GRIP!

5) When I purchased this set, I made the assumption that this set came with all of the videos necessary to complete this course. Sadly, I was wrong. There is another set of 10 DVDs referred to as the ""Workshop DVDs,"" that do not come with the course. Ultimately, you'll spend another $70 for the workshop DVDs (including postage and handling) if you want to get the workshops. While you can read what the instructor goes over in the workshop within the book, you're missing out on almost half of the learning experience if you don't have the workshop DVDs. After Spending $150 on the basic course, I did not purchase the workshop DVDs. I just think the advertisements for this course should be MUCH clearer to indicate that more purchases are necessary to receive the full course.

This is my impression of the course after completing 18 of the 28 lessons. Thankfully, I also purchased Music Theory for Dummies, which has been a god-send and strong supplement for this course. Often the instructor teaches things within the class but really doesn't full explain them. Having a supplemental music theory book to fall-back on for more information has been a very wise move.",1328486400,53,2603,4.5610278372591

8422106,5,B004BO8JAO,"I am still working my way through these lessons. They are amazing! I can already play Lean On Me, and I'm only on lesson 5. If you want to learn piano, this is for you. You can work as fast or slow as you want. The instruction is clear and thought out. I really enjoy the CD's you can practice with. It is fun to ""play"" along with a band.",1508371200,,338,3.842857142857143

8422110,1,B004BO8JAO,These look like an old time videos.  The get frozen after 14 minutes into watching.,1448928000,2,83,4.533333333333333
8422111,5,B004BO8JAO,I have had lessons  so I am at least familiar with some piano basics and I am off and running with this and the bonus workshops.  It is all great to watch and take on board at my own pace.  I will never meet Will Barrow but he is the best teacher I have had and if I am behind with something I will not waste a lesson not being able to play it for him. It is all there for me to do it when I can and I think I will.  When I have done it I will check Will Barrow or Legacy Learning Systems again for maybe something more advanced.  Like maybe Jazz.,1419292800,9,547,3.6810344827586206
8422112,5,B004BO8JAO,You will need separate set of practice DVDs with this.  Love it.  I am a beginner an I love it,1408406400,3,94,3.65
