8212354,5,B000U7YPLI,Nice presentation of LeMond's incredible 89 Tour...,1430006400,,51,6.428571428571429
8212355,4,B000U7YPLI,"It's a great cycling story, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said ""How did they make such an amazing sporting achievement so boring?""  I think a large reason for the lack of excitement was the drab background music, not just the weak commentary.  Regardless, I got enjoyment out of it as a piece of cycling history and seeing Greg Lemond's performance after recovering from being shot in a hunting accident.",1425168000,,416,4.684931506849315
8212356,2,B000U7YPLI,"I have to say, I was expecting something different. This production was really pretty amateurish, and managed to almost totally fail in building suspense towards what was one of the most amazing dramas in sports history.

I remember the commentary during the actual race being much more interesting and in depth (NBC). Why didn't they just buy rights to that?",1417392000,,359,4.983333333333333

8212358,4,B000U7YPLI,"I am glad to see a DVD of this Tour available, and glad that Phil Liggett narrated it. I have enjoyed his commentaries on the Tours de France since 1986. He is very knowledgable and passionate about cycle racing.

At 90 minutes covering a 3-week race this is barely a synopsis of the the whole, but does show the action.  The narration does not have the liveliness of the commentary that accompanied the race as it was happening.  That is the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. As a documentary of the Tour, it might have been better if the editor had cut in some of the original commentary that went with the images. But that may have been very difficult to do -- I do not know the problems of cutting a long race down to a short documentary.",1252800000,5,749,4.223776223776224
8212359,5,B000U7YPLI,"There are a few moments in sports that are iconic in stature and this incredible duel between Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon is one of those timeless events.

A duel between the two riders came down to the final stage, a 24.5k individual time trial, with Fignon holding a solid lead of 50 seconds and having the advantage of knowing LeMond's course splits throughout his short trek. What LeMond accomplished that day to capture the race victory - after a shooting accident the year before nearly cost him his life - is breathtaking in scope.

The edited coverage of each stage is impressive and the focus on this battle under the sun is special. Two athletes are at the peak of their powers and eight precious seconds separated them from either savoring victory or suffering a devastating defeat on the streets of Paris.",1225324800,,820,4.7272727272727275
