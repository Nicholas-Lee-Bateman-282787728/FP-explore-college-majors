8621479,4,B00G9JQYUQ,"Nothing wrong with the blu rays.  I have read Act of Valor and seen it already, so when I saw it in a package with Red Dawn, a movie I hadn't seen, I bought it.  Red Dawn's story line was just so unbelievable.  But that's okay.  If you looked at the deeper meaning, then it did its job I guess.  Act of Valor is of course amazing.",1392076800,,330,3.8656716417910446
8621480,5,B00G9JQYUQ,We bought this duo pack based on impulse looking for action movies for the Christmas and New Year season.  Wow...were we ever surprised on how AWESOME these would be.  We were on edge-of-seats and enjoyed them immensely.  Highly recommend these movies if you are looking for great action movies.,1390521600,,295,4.979591836734694
