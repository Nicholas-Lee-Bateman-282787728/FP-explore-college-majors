8453456,1,B00520MOP2,I returned this DVD for refund.  It was an illegal copy made in China.  The English translation for Japanese was wrong in many places.  Also its English was grammatically wrong.,1410220800,2,177,4.833333333333333
8453457,5,B00520MOP2,"I was worried at first that an all-region DVD wouldn't work in my region B/2 blu-ray player but Confessions actually works!  And I really love the directors movies but I think this is one of his most genius works yet!  It even had some sense humor in it too.  There's nothing really bad to say about other than the long wait it took for it to get here but that doesn't really count.

Jaa~",1377820800,,388,4.202702702702703
8453458,1,B00520MOP2,"Sadly, the English subtitles in this film are so bad as to be completely incomprehensible.  Eventually, I just turned them off and translated the lines to the students myself.  Absolutely awful.",1367280000,3,194,5.225806451612903
8453459,1,B00520MOP2,"There is an obnoxious red sparkling ad that migrates around the screen while you are trying to watch the movie! The subtitles are dreadfully scripted, and are unnecessarily rendered as large pixelated letters that conflict with the visual beauty of the film.

After watching this movie in a theater in Japan almost three years ago, I was truly inspired by the way in which Yoshiyuki Koike integrated innovative editing techniques with Nakashima's dynamic and unconstrained method of camera direction, as well as prolonged head-on shots similar to other legendary filmmakers such as Ozu. Upon conclusion of the movie I knew deeply that Japan had preserved its heritage in the ART of film into the 21st Century. However, this product reminded me of the horrible injustices that fall upon great works of art. Not only is this animated sparkling ad annoying, it is simply not part of the film. The final cut of the movie is the movie. Any permanently altered version of the final cut is not the original movie, and is thus a new movie. This is perfectly fine for restorations or digital replication, but this permanently altered version is a complete detriment to Kokuhaku, because the changes result from the changer's own selfish interest, not to preserve the film for artistic or historical value.",1365811200,4,1296,5.0
8453460,5,B00520MOP2,the movie was very good but the sub's are way off what a disappointment wish i can say the dvd was all legit but it's not so if you want this dvd with english sub's you have to find it some were else,1343779200,,199,3.6511627906976742
8453461,3,B00520MOP2,"Honestly, I had already seen the film, but got the DVD because the version I saw didn't have subtitles (I later found one that did), but to my great displeasure, the translation seemed to have been done by someone who was half-asleep and didn't really know English.  So, that aside and the little annoying red box that appears in the right-hand corner (but disppears as the film progresses), the movie was great.  The actors/tresses were amazing, the story delectably dark and twisted--overall, a great buy if you know Japanese or already have seen the film with, erm, better subtitles.",1309478400,9,586,4.909090909090909
