1338497,5,B000046S2E,"This is by far the best volume in the 1-5 set!  It deals with themes of Artificial Life and a twist on the origins of man!

""Long Distance Call"" -- a chilling episode about a little boy and his dying grandmother. [**]

""I Sing the Body Electric"" -- an robotic nanny is built to take care of some children.  They grow attached to her... [**1/2]

""The Lonely""  -- Perhaps the best TZ episode ever?  A prisoner on a lifeless planet is given a robot companion.  He is at first reluctant to buy into this illusion, but this illusion becomes his reality... [*****]

""Probe 7, Over and Out""  -- Great episode written by Sterling about a man who crashes his spaceship on a (seemingly) uninhabited planet.  He later discovers his home planet destroys itself in a nuclear war...  Fantastic suprise ending!  [****]

If you're only passively interested in the TZ, this should be one of the first DVD volumes that you buy!  It contains some truly exceptional episodes.",1102377600,7,960,4.625
1338498,4,B000046S2E,"Volume 5 of Collection One features four good episodes. ""Long Distance Call"" is somewhat predictable, but the acting makes it entertaining. ""I Sing the Body Electric"" was written by Ray Bradbury and is about the newest member of the family: Grandmother/Robot. The story focuses on family as its theme, however, not science fiction. ""The Lonely"" is the best episode of Volume 5 and involves a convict in years of solitary confinement. ""Probe 7"" is initially suspenseful, and ends with an interesting twist. Overall this collection is quite good and recommended.",1049846400,3,560,5.233333333333333
1338499,5,B000046S2E,"No matter what anyone says about this volume, watch it for the benefit of seeing the actor Richard Basehart in ""Probe 7-Over and Out"".  He went on to star in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and that was the most sucessful action series on television in the 1960's. David Headson did the series entirely because of him. Another note worthy episode is ""I Sing the Body Electric"" starring Veronica Cartwright.  On her webpage she says it was the most successful episode of her appearance on the series.
Watch it !",989625600,3,510,4.532608695652174
1338500,4,B000046S2E,"I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC was Ray Bradbury's sole contribution to the ""Twilight Zone."" One of the more subtle episodes, this story is strong on characterization and reaches out on an emotional level rather than to any notion of scientific curiosity of the introduction of a robot grandmother, beautifully played by Josephine Hutchinson, into a family (including Veronica Cartwright). This is a very good episode and is one of my favorites.  THE LONELY is one of Rod Serling's classics from the series. Jack Warden convincingly plays a convict sentenced to forty years alone on a distant asteroid. A periodic supply ship commanded by John Dehner one day leaves him a companion, a robot played flawlessly by Jean Marsh. Bernard Herrmann's poignant score evokes the enigmatic inner feeling of Jack Warden's love for his companion. And subsequently Herrmann's score captures the human quality of this female robot as she reciprocates that love. The combination of scripting, acting and scoring realistically captures our perceptions of loneliness, love, loss and reality.  PROBE 7 - OVER AND OUT leisurely written by Rod Serling for the 5th Season examines the relationship of two beings, Richard Basehart and Antoinette Bower, the sole survivors of their respective annihilated planets. Basehart and the much underrated and forgotten Bower give good performances. LONG DISTANCE CALL written by Charles Beaumont and William Idelson is one of the six episodes recorded directly to videotape instead of being photographed on film. The story concerns a little boy played by Billy Mumy who communicates with his dead grandmother over his toy phone. Thematically it rounds out this volume as it examines our attachment to those we love.",983145600,18,1726,5.295620437956204

7919681,4,B000046S2E,"Volume 5 of ""The Twilight Zone"" features four more classic episodes that are well known and beloved by Twilight Zone fans everywhere. Some of the volumes released of Twilight Zone series may have a couple of really good stories on it and one or two just so-so episodes. (I am a diehard fan of the show but even I will admit not every episode was good some could even be real clunkers) But with volume 5 you do get four outstanding episodes to watch with some big name actors to boot. So make some popcorn, get a cold drink, put your feet up and get ready for some great story telling.

The first episode is ""Long Distance Call"". It is about a grandmother who is dying and is very close to her grandson. For his birthday she gives him a toy phone. The grandmother dies not too long after and not long after that the boy's parents find him talking on his toy phone to his departed grandmother. They think at first he just misses his grandmother but when the boy decides he wants to be with her the tension mounts. The young boy in this episode is played by Billy Mumy. Some may remember him as Will Robinson on ""Lost In Space"". But ""Twilight Zone"" fans may remember him even more as the creepy little boy in another classic TZ episode ""It's A Good Life"". Mummy made three episodes with TZ and they really show what a great child actor he was.

The next episode is based on a Ray Bradbury screenplay. The title is ""I Sing The Body Electric"". A widower is raising his three children alone. Deciding they need a woman's influence in their lives the four of them go to a store where a robot can be designed for them as a grandmother figure. The oldest daughter, played by Veronica Cartwright, however wants nothing to do with her. She is still hurt by the death of her mother and does not want to be close to anyone anymore until an incident occurs that changes her mind.

""The Lonely"" stars Jack Warden as a man convicted of murder and sentenced to life in solitude on an asteroid. Every few months a spaceship arrives with food and supplies for the convict. The captain of the spaceship takes pity on him with his loneliness and on one of his stops to the asteroid brings Warden a package. A robot in the shape of a woman he can put together for company. Everything works out great until Warden is given a pardon and can go home until he realizes what that means.

In ""Probe 7, Over & Out"" two planets that have been at war with each other finally destroy each other leaving just two people, one from each planet, left. Richard Basehart, whose name is Adam, has crash landed on a planet during the battle. He eventually meets the other person from the opposing planet they were in battle with. She is a female whose name is... yup you guessed it Eve. They are on the planet Earth and the rest is history as they say.

For anyone who is a huge fan of the show volume 5 is a must have because of these being some of the best episodes ""Twilight Zone"" ever had. For someone who has never seen the show before this volume would make a great introduction into ""The Twilight Zone"". Either way I highly recommend this DVD.",1387497600,3,3110,4.327615780445969
7919682,5,B000046S2E,Love these old TV shows! And this volume has quite a few of my favorites. Would love to have them all!,1385856000,,102,3.9047619047619047
7919683,4,B000046S2E,"I'm glad I didn't pay much for this. It seemed like a much better show back when I was a kid watching it. Where the stories are well written and for the most part, well acted, the experience of watching them was more like looking through an old family album than anything else. Not that my family is as strange as ""Twilight Zone""...wait, yes it is. In any case, it was fun to remember what was scary years ago, and to see how much things have changed in the world since this series ran. It's just not something I would want to watch over and over like many of the black and white DVDs in my collection.",1377820800,,602,4.153846153846154
7919684,5,B000046S2E,Very pleased with this selection (I ordered vol. 1-6). Can't beat the price & the quality of the DVD is great for how old it is (how long ago these were filmed). Pleased with the speed of the delivery as well.,1355875200,,209,4.121951219512195
7919685,5,B000046S2E,"As a seventh grade teacher, we cover the story of ""Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"" in our literature book. I was thrilled to find the original Twilight Zone dvd of that story. As an added plus, there are three other episodes on it as well. My students were fascinated with the black/white film which started a whole different conversation regarding television ""back then"".",1338076800,,374,4.859375
7919686,5,B000046S2E,Great stuff. Brings back great childhood memories. Watched these in the late 60s when I was just a kid. Picture quality is great. Sound level very clear but just a little too low for me. My hearing is a little off but all you have to do is turn up the volume slightly and you are good to go!,1233187200,,291,3.9491525423728815
