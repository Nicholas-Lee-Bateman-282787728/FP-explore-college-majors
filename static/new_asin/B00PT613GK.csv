8689140,1,B00PT613GK,I was fooled into purchasing this home made dvd by reading a review of another product.  Don't be fooled. This is not a more complete version of the Rankin Bass classic special Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer as one might be led to believe.  It is a vhs or worse copy transferred to dvd and image quality is poor with non of the cut original scenes that one might be interested in.  Buyer beware - I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.,1420675200,3,440,4.341463414634147
