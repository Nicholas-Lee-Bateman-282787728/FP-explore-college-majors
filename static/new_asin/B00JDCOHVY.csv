8649886,5,B00JDCOHVY,Felt like I was in the middle of a family. Real and gritty!!,1515715200,,60,3.6923076923076925
8649887,5,B00JDCOHVY,"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! This is a dark comedy with every scene very natural and realistic. There are no special effects here, no exaggerated or ""Hollywoodistic"" scenes. The story follows an accidental encounter between a young woman in her twenties who is undergoing an appendix surgery and a mother who suffers from HIV/AIDS. Subsequently they befriend and the young woman moves in with the family. The rest, is a liberal and free spirited series of experiences. I strongly recommend it!",1430265600,,497,5.30379746835443

8649889,5,B00JDCOHVY,"The Amazing Catfish Review

Profound, moving, enjoyable, and humorous, is how I would describe this movie.  It reveals the importance of connections between people  how they effect and can positively change lifes major and profound setbacks and turn them into something good.

It is slow moving - not a road trip-action-adventure type of American movie (although there is a road trip in it). A multitude of life events and social problems do unfold in an up-close, personal way. Past and current, harsh struggles in their lives are softened by the endearing nature of the characters and the humorous manner in which they are revealed.  The interaction of this motley crew of characters is very heart-warming, revealing both tragedy and joy.

This movie is definitely worth the effort of reading the subtitles.  It is in Spanish with English subtitles.  I didn't miss any scenes by reading it and it wasn't a chore, as reading the subtitles of some other films have been.  There is less dialogue in this film than others, adding to the ease.

In my opinion, it is worth the wait for the connections between the characters to be revealed.  This film is a treasure.",1416873600,,1162,4.877551020408164

8649892,4,B00JDCOHVY,This is in SPANISH with English subtitles. We would not have purchased had we known that.,1411344000,,89,4.625
8649893,3,B00JDCOHVY,"I hadn't realized this movie was in Spanish, with English subtitles, which is okay for me but just didn't catch that in the description, so know that it is.  Some indie films are great and others are just okay, this was one of the ""it's okay"" ones, in my view.  Meaning I am donating my copy to the library.  I'm disappointed, because from the description of the movie, I was really looking forward to watching it.",1406764800,,414,4.421052631578948
8649894,5,B00JDCOHVY,"A great film.  I was able to catch this film when it played in town, enjoyed every minute.  I am glad to see it is available on DVD, I will certainly be purchasing a copy.",1403654400,,171,3.857142857142857
