I have been listening to the Who for the  last 30 years and this DVD has let them down badly. I am sure that Roger  and the other artists can't be happy with end result. Help!",945734400,7,353,4.176470588235294
7905310,4,B000009CDW,"This DVD contains a large portion of one of Roger Daltrey's 50th birthday celebration concerts. The concerts featured many special guests, including fellow members of The Who John Entwistle and Pete Townshend. Roger re-worked most of the songs, enlisting the help of a big band, including the Juilliard Orchestra, guitarist Phil Palmer, bassist Pino Palladino, drummer Simon Phillips, percussionist Jody Linscott, and backup singers Billy Nicholls and Cleveland Watkiss, all of which had or would work with The Who or Pete Townshend more than once. Conductor Michael Kamen also put together an overture of Pete Townshend's music to open the show.

After the overture, the main concert begins with relatively low-key versions of You Better You Bet and I Can See For Miles, the latter in coffeehouse  style. The show then really kicks in to full gear with a performance of 5:15 starring David Sanborn. The interplay between Sanborn and a trumpet soloist from the Juilliard Orchestra recalls the interplay between Townshend and Entwistle in The Who's versions. After this, Roger delivers sublime versions of The Song Is Over, Imagine a Man, and Love Reign O'er Me, before introducing the Chieftains and Sinead O'Connor. The Chieftains sabotage an already weak version of Baba O'Riley, but compliment After the Fire nicely. Roger takes the lead vocal on both of these, and Sinead takes the harmony. Then John  Entwistle comes out and joins the Chieftains for Behind Blue Eyes. Roger takes the middle section a cappella, and John gets a solo. Both the Chieftains and John then exit, and the orchestra begins the Tommy section, unfortunately without Sparks. Linda Perry joins Roger for I'm Free. She is a powerful singer, but overdoes this performance. Roger delivers a slightly rough performance of See Me, Feel Me, before John comes back out for The Real Me. By this point in the show Roger's voice is shot, and he also confuses the lyrics, so ends up doing the ""Maaaatttttthhhhhhhher"" scream twice. However, he gets a bit of a break when Pete Townshend takes the stage for a bluesy version of Who Are You. Roger shows more strength when he closes the show with a tour de force Won't Get Fooled Again. He manages the legendary scream better than ever here, too. Finally, the orchestra leads the audience through Happy Birthday.

All in all, a great collection of performances, despite a large portion of the concert not being included. This was probably because the DVD was taken straight from the pay-per view special. Unfortunately, this also means the video quality is more grainy than what most of us are used to. The audio mix is also subpar, with Roger as well as the backup singers being overpowered sometimes. Still a great DVD, though. Highly recommended for serious fans of The Who and/or Roger Daltrey.",1460764800,,2809,4.995726495726496

7905312,5,B000009CDW,"Many I see give this a bad review based on bad sound quality. I don't know what players they played this DVD on, but on my 5.1 system, this played great! Sure I had better 5.1 mixes on a DVD, but this is not bad at all. Most reviews on this DVD are so old, I doubt they had a 5.1 home system but just played through their old stereo TV.
  I love the arrangements and Orchestra in this DVD! I wish more bands would do this, it brings such a full and fresh sound. This is one heck of a great DVD, one that I will watch alot!",1350172800,,522,3.779816513761468
7905313,5,B000009CDW,"This show is very emotional because there is a very simbolic moment when John Entwistle and Pino Palladino shake hands and change the bass John played in ""The Real Me"".

This show was recorded for Roger Daltrey s' 50th birthday and features a varied name of artists and singers. Sadly, this cd does not feature the complete show and songs played that evening.

This show only features 2/3 of the complete show but contains excelent production and arrangements on some songs specially on ""THE SEA REFUSES NO RIVER"", ""IMAGINE A MAN"", ""SONG IS OVER"".

and ""DOCTOR JIMMY"" (sung by Linda Perry). The songs featured on the cd and this dvd, mix old and overplayed favorite WHO tracks such as ""PINBALL WIZARD"", ""BEHIND BLUE EYES"" AND ""WONT GET FOOLED AGAIN"", but also includes rarely or never played before WHO and Pete Townshend solo tracks such as  ""THE SEA REFUSES NO RIVER"", ""IMAGINE A MAN"", ""SONG IS OVER"" and ""DOCTOR JIMMY"" among others. JOHN ENTWISTLE visits the band and plays PINO PALLADINO bass on ""THE REAL ME"". Pino plays on the rest of the show. ""PETE TOWNSHEND plays and sings on ""WHO ARE YOU"" (he wanted to sing ""THE SHOUT"", but Roger did not). For me Rogers singing in ""THE SEA REFUSES NO RIVER"" is excellent but in ""SONG IS OVER"" he shows the sings of age in his voice or maybe he was not at his best that night.

Linda Perry is excellent in DOCTOR JIMMY, Roger Daltrey does the introduction to Linda: ""she reminds me of Janis""...

The excelent orchesta is conducted by and arrangemens are done no other than MICHEL KAMEN who sadly passed away later.

Alice Cooper s' producer, does the production of the show (Alice sang ""I am a Boy"" in that concert, but is not included).",1141948800,5,1682,4.586666666666667
7905314,1,B000009CDW,"I was fortunate enought to attend this concert, and if you think about it, the sound at Carnagie Hall in NYC is world famous. And on this night, the acoustics of the hall lived up to the reputation. So, WHAT HAPPENED? Who dropped the ball?

It's New York City, you have at your disposal the finest most up-to-date technical equipment available anywhere. You are recording in a hall that is acoustically perfect as you can get, and the end result is THIS LOUSY DVD?

 All in attendance were in awe of the performence that night. We are equally in awe over how this could be the end result of such an amazing event.  Pathetic.",1130025600,4,624,4.447368421052632
7905315,2,B000009CDW,"Who finalized the authorization of this DVD for public sales? Whoever it was, he / she must have been half asleep. The sound quality of this DVD is terrible. Even with Daltrey belting out such Who goods as ""You Better, You Bet"", ""I Can See For Miles"", ""I'm Free"" among others doesn't even come close to making up for the fact this DVD should NOT be bought for any MORE than, say $5.00 if you happen to find it in a cut-out bid.",1116547200,7,427,4.156626506024097
7905316,1,B000009CDW,"Just got this Dvd out of the box for a 2nd look after a few months and know why I put it away, This DVD is simply bad!! quality poor crappy video, looks like a 3rd generation video The audio is poor also with its supposed 4.1,

 How they get away with releasing such rubbish beats me how an Artist of Rogers standing can give this the go ahead, he must never have had a look at this result it's an insult

 I get fed up of buying inferior DVD quality its not just this one, the situation is pathetic anything goes, stick it on a DVD and everyone thinks the quality will be just wonderful, There just is no apparent Quality measurements of late in the production of so many DVDS, We should return all these discs and complain to the producers, God help us.  We may as well stick to VHS it getting to the same standard.",1115856000,4,817,4.113207547169812
7905317,1,B000009CDW,"This may not interest too many people, but since the DVD is listed under ""Alice Cooper"", and since he performed the song ""I'm A Boy"" at THIS concert, I went and bought it. BUT THEY CUT THE TRACK OUT! There's no, repeat NO, Alice Cooper track on this DVD! So buy it for any other reason than I did! Or look for a VHS copy of the whole concert or the 2-CD-set.",1018224000,9,358,3.986111111111111
7905318,4,B000009CDW,"I've given the CD a poor review, but the DVD is just the opposite.  The filmed production was a concert I wish I'd attended, and I haven't had the DVD technical glitches experienced by others.  I do think the concert might have been videotaped rather than filmed, and that would account for the less crisp visuals.  When it comes to the star, that physical presence of Daltrey wins me over where the CD performance does not.  Not only is his voice in high gear, though occasionally drowned out by the orchestra, Daltrey is very energized.  The guest stars are more in the background than they are on the CD (one reason the CD is so annoying).  Moreover, Daltrey starts off very formal as he first takes the stage, but slowly more of the famed body is revealed until by the climax of Won't Be Fooled Again you believe it's the Daltrey of old.  Here's a man who was definitely forced to give up his #1 career - by Townshend's 80s WHO retirement - far in advance of his interest or his abilities.  Nice affectionate moments with Daltrey and Entwistle and then Daltrey and Townshend (whose own appearance had initially been reluctant; presumably Daltrey had threatened him, but you can't tell that here).  If you're a fan of the WHO, you should have this DVD.  If you're a fan of Daltrey specifically, you must have this DVD in your collection.  And you can envy all those people who had great seats, especially those in the front row.",1017532800,12,1431,4.55078125
