6270986,1,B00IKM5MXU,"There are not enough adjectives in the English language for me to convey just how terrible this movie was. I know, I should have known that when I saw Eric Roberts name in the credits, but I watched it anyway. Where Roberts once had the potential to become a dynamite actor he squandered any chance when he decided to take on any role in any movie just to be working. That's led to so many turkeys that his nickname could now be Butterball. Please Eric, stop making drek and start making real movies. Actually act instead of phoning in performances.

Worse yet is who is responsible for this terrible waste of film. There was a time when Olivier Gruner had the potential to become a top of the line martial arts star. His role in the low budget classic NEMESIS was fantastic. But he's never followed that up with a starring role that showed he could act let alone write or direct. Now he's done both of those as well as star in this load of crap.

So here's the story. A covert ops team of mercenaries is hired by the CIA via Roberts to take out a middle eastern bad guy. Unfortunately the military isn't aware of this operation and bombs the base where the bad guy is hiding at the same time the assassination is going down. This results in the mercs being captured with the exception of Gruner. He returns home and asks for help retrieving his men but no go. Now we get to spend time watching him train and workout while he plans to go back. SPOILER ALERT. He eventually does so and while he and his men combined couldn't take out the bad guys during an air strike, this time around he does so alone for the most part until he gets them free. They return home and he tells Roberts he's out. End of film.

There is so much down time in this film between action sequences that it is perhaps the most boring film ever made with the exception of Andy Warhol's EMPIRE, a movie that was a steady shot of the Empire State Building. Then again that movie might have proved more interesting. Perhaps if you have a fetish for watching someone working out this movie might prove worth your while. For most it is tedious at best and unwatchable at most.

If the story telling weren't bad enough there was so much else to hate here. When it comes to villains it's as if someone placed an ad that read ""If you have a swarthy complexion and a beard we want you"". Sets look like they were made for a high school stage production. For a movie taking place in a desert country everything looked so fresh and newly painted. I think at times even the dirt looked clean. Uniforms of captured prisoners months after they'd been held captive even looked good. At least the evil bad guys were kind enough to send prisoners clothes out to be dry cleaned. The lighting on scenes that were day for night looked fake and for some reasons with no light source seen the inside of buildings had spots shooting in various areas instead of lamps.

I could go on but I already feel like I've wasted far too much of my time talking about the movie. To type on about this movie is to take even more than the 91 minutes of my life that was wasted just watching it. The most aggravating thing when watching something like this is knowing that there are so many other movies that deserve a chance to be made sitting on shelves and collecting dust. Shame on anyone who thought this deserved to be made instead of one of those.",1409356800,5,3388,4.337539432176656

6270990,1,B00IKM5MXU,"SOME PLOT SPOILERS...If possible.

The film opens with a monologue with the most annoying French accent since ""Tracy, I Love You."" We discover that mercenaries are now called PMCs...oh the political correctness. 4 PMCs who work for Eric Roberts go into ""Sector 4"" to assassinate the number 3 Al Qaida. Although this was made in 2014 some guy named Bin Laden is still number one.

As it turns out, they have unexpected air support as they get captured. Nash (Olivier Gruner) manages to escape to return to his ex-wife (?) and kid who he hasn't taken to the Grand Canyon. Instead he does the Rocky thing at the gym. When he discovers his mates are still alive, he opts to return to rescue them. Having seen Eric Robert's films before he suspects there is something he is not being told and doesn't care if he spoils the plot for us too.

Before he goes on to rescue his team of 8 years, he has to go get specialized training from an Israeli, stuff that I would have expected he would already know like how to disarm a man with a banana. We watch two men swap a gun back and forth for several minutes. In one scene, where Nash uses his gun swapping experience to get a car, we get to see a large microphone in the upper right corner. Retakes cost money and God knows how much they had to spend to get a name like Eric Roberts.

Jillian Alysse plays the disagreeable wife who manages to deliver poorly written lines in an unconvincing fashion.

Not worth watching for free, except for maybe some MST value.

6271302,1,B00IKM5MXU,"Words fail me. Clearly, this is the MOST disappointing military movie of 2014! Some scenes are laughable. In one scene, Nash, the main character, buys a couple guns from a wholly unbelievably horrible actor portraying a Russian arms dealer, without even so much as touching the merchandise. But, in the next scene, a big deal is made about looking under the hood of a piece of junk car he never procedures and touching irrelevant components. The whole film is like a high school ROCKY remake. The acting is, well, nonexistent. Most of the movie (using the term lightly) is filmed at night or under low light conditions and the ""action"" is impossible to see. In many scenes enemy Afghan soldiers are talking but we have no clue as to what is being said because the subtitles are missing.

6271339,3,B00IKM5MXU,"Okay, down with the naysayers.  This is NOT the worst movie ever. It's far from it.  It isn't bad at all.  It IS predictable and it does use the same drone flyby over and over.  And some scenes are better done than others, that's for sure.

Sector 4 is supposed to be that area between Afghanistan and Pakistan where the high level Taliban/Al Qaeda leaders cached themselves.

It's a basic movie about keeping promises of No Man Left Behind.  Nash (Oliver Gruner, lead actor, director, producer and story writer) leads a four man squad to capture the #3 Most Wanted terrorist.  Due to a lack of communications between the private contractors and military, Nash and his men are captured.  Only Nash escapes, returns to the U.S. then vows to return to find his team.
