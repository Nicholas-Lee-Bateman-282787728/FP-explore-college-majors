71639,5,0784011370,"Stallone gives one of his best performances in what is arguably the best film he ever made. Dennehy is great as the local cop that Rambo takes to war while Richard Crenna shines as Rambo's former CO. David Caruso, who  would later star on TV's NYPD Blue, makes an appearance as one of Dennehy's  deputies. This movie has one of the greatest ""chase scenes"" ever  made that is still believable. Great non-stop action throughout culminates  in the ""Vietnam speech"" scene which can rate from  ""Brilliant"" to ""Embarrassing"" depending on your  viewpoint. Must have movie for Stallone or Dennehy fans!",940204800,9,594,4.94949494949495
71640,5,0784011370,"This film is so misunderstood.
It's not about violence, guns or knives. It's not even about Small Town narrow minds.
It's about one man and his struggle to re-enter a society which called on him in their hour of need  then forgot him in his - the violence is just background noise.
It's  unfortunate this film is grouped together with it's subsequent sequels.  Rambo II and III are of a different genre.
Where as they are all hack  and slash, First Blood is more subtle, more tragic.
Summed up when Rambo,  in tears, recalls how back in Vietnam he comanded multi million dollar  gunboats, tanks, helicopters, back home he can't even wash cars.
Not to  be missed. Brilliant stuff.",914112000,4,679,4.65546218487395

71642,5,0784011370,"A lot of people do not realize that the first film in the Rambo series had a strong anti war theme running through it. John Rambo, a former Green Beret attempts to visit a friend from Vietnam. He discovers his friend has died from cancer and it is suggested he came home with it. Rambo ends up passing through a small town and has a run in with a sheriff who abuses his authority. Things escalate quickly. Rambo displays PTSD and freaks out at the police station, escaping out of fear and into the forest, where the police attempt to hunt him and are later joined by the National Guard.

I'm not going to spoil the full story, but this movie is outstanding. A lot of people think Rocky is Stallone's best work. I think this film is.",1518134400,3,732,4.304347826086956

71645,4,0784011370,"But first about the film. The action feel goes from tame to very intense at the police station (sheriff's office?) to the hunt when one cautious deputy says they are not hunting him--that he is hunting them! Then things get tame for a while again till the climax.

Now, since Ho Chi Minh committed the brutal act I wrote of in my title to this review please remember before you watch this film (again?) in why the US was in Vietnam in the 60's to begin with. See my other reveiws.",1516665600,,480,4.274725274725275
71646,5,0784011370,Classic movie. Commentary adds so much depth and insight to the film.  I believe the final scene in the police station with the Colonel is one of the finest moments in the history of cinema.,1514937600,,190,4.428571428571429

71651,5,0784011370,i freaking love rambo he's my favorite action hero next to batman. i think my favorite aspect of first blood is that he doesn't kill anyone (directly) and that's what makes him so honorable.,1509148800,,190,4.617647058823529

71658,5,0784011370,Still a great movie.  I watched this with my son recently...and this movies is as good as ever.  I have to say that compared to more modern-day rated R movies...it's pretty tame in comparison.  John J. Rambo is still one of my favorite movie characters.  He just doesn't understand why people hate him.,1504483200,2,302,4.6415094339622645
71659,5,0784011370,Oneof the greatest movies of all time. Showed up as expected. Unfortunately I was in the hospital due to my girlfriend having my baby so I had to wait a couple days to watch it.

71666,5,0784011370,"Although as I write in 2017, this film is about 35 years old, it is still exciting to watch. The action is non-stop and riveting. Stallone is terrific in the film, so too is Brian Dennehy as the sheriff who harasses Rambo and then leads an army of deputies and National Guardsmen trying to kill him drawing first blood against an innocent Vietnam veteran who won the Congressional Medal of Honor and who was mistreated by civilians in the US because he fought in Vietnam.  I saw the film some years ago and I enjoyed today seeing it again.",1498608000,,539,4.444444444444445
71667,5,0784011370,this is a very good movie  buy this one too.,1498521600,,44,3.4
71668,5,0784011370,"I read this book when it came out. It's of course how people treated Vietnam Veterans. No respect. Rambo was part of an elite team of soldiers. He came home to nothing. His team all dead with nobody to turn to. Mentally unstable. A Sheriff picks a fight with him that sends him back. A one man army. It was true to the book except in the book he died in the end. But if that happened there wouldn't have been all the following Rambo movies. It's worth watching, sometimes a little far fetched but with him being an elite killing machine against a small town force I guess not too much.",1497398400,,585,4.232142857142857

71677,5,0784011370,First Blood is absolutely amazing.  When I watched it for the first time I was glued to the TV unable to relax for a second.  The whole movie flows perfectly and you can't help but feel bad for Rambo.  If you have the vision of Rambo running around with a machine gun in your head you might be better suited for the 2nd or 3rd because although there is a lot of action in First Blood it's not the guns blazing action that pop culture makes Rambo out to be.  I personally think the 2nd and 3rd movies are just average and unfortunately I think they actually hurt the original because it makes the character of Rambo look a whole lot different.  The DVD is just what I wanted and the price was perfect.,1492041600,,700,4.1940298507462686
71678,5,0784011370,It's first blood. The rest of the Rambo movies are whatever at best but this is a classic with some actual depth to what's going on.,1491264000,,132,4.115384615384615

71681,3,0784011370,This is a pretty good action movie.  That I think actually gets better the more you watch it.  The first time I saw it I thought it was o.k.  But after hearing everybody talk about how great it was.  Watched it again and did like it better.  Sylvester Stallone who at the time had made other movies but really couldn't shake being Rocky. And I don't really think Rambo was such an iconic character until later.  One thing when he escapes from jail and rides off on a motorcycle you can tell it's a stunt double.,1489795200,,511,4.270833333333333

71684,5,0784011370,"One of the last great action movies before CGI effects made everything look so fake. The stunning cinematography and rugged landscape of Hope, B.C. lend a gritty realism to a predictable plot and help overcome some lame acting by some of the supporting cast.

This film is great at showing how a good person can be labeled and misjudged so easily. Unfortunately this often leads to consequences for both sides.

Look, I get it, Vietnam was rough but at least one good thing came out of it and thats RAMBO! This dude can do it all, fight, scream and blow stuff up! If you're a small town cop who hates everything and likes to make fun a veterans then you better watch out for RAMBO because hell set you straight; straight to hell! My favorite part of this movie is when he blows up that dumb Gas Station that probably didn't even need to be there anyway! The only dumb part of this movie is when RAMBO cries because dudes like RAMBO probably wouldnt cry unless their mom died or something serious like that and Im pretty sure RAMBOS mom isn't dead even though Im pretty sure were never introduced to her.

71702,5,0784011370,"If you like action movies, this is one of my top 5 of all time (Rocky, Conan, Predator, and Terminator rounding out the others).  The First ""Rambo"" is super good, it is pretty realistic in an action move sort of way (the subsequent movies become super fake as he kills 100's of enemies, in this first movie only one person dies).  The acting is great, the movie is extremely rewatchable (I have probably watched it 20 times at least).  This and Rocky are Sylvester Stallone's best movies in my opinion.

First Blood is a fun, satisfying action movie about abusive, redneck style law enforcement bullies who pick a fight with the wrong man, a PTSD suffering Vietnam veteran who did nothing but enter ""their"" town and was dragged into jail because they took issue with his looks. Enjoyed watching the protagonist, Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone, beating up these bullies.  It's a fun story about bullies getting what they deserve.

Vets after the Vietnam war, where treated like garbage and that's a true shame, its disgusting to think fellow Americans treated those who fought, ended up being looked down upon. This is an awesome showdown with a damaged man against the thugs and bullies in law enforcement. Rambo is an awesome character and a perfect example of old school warrior and vigilante style hero. Brain Dennehy is always a perfect bad guy and he shined to the point you really ended up hating him. The dynamic plot of a Vet coming home, no job, no welcome and then finding all his friends are gone. He wonders place to place and then is mistreated and man handled and pushed to far. Rambo will always be a shinning character of action warrior brilliance. A great, old school, perfect action flick of one man against an army of thugs.",1453420800,3,945,4.5321637426900585

My all time favorite chase scene is Rambo taking off on that whining 2-stroke Yamaha underpowered enduro motorcycle. He kills it. Slays it. No helmet, no shirt, cold, wet, dreary winter and Rambo is just killing it. Blasting big airs of the RR trax, I mean this guy is really riding that thing! Great movie.

Sylvester Stallone is magnificent as Rambo, as is Dennehy in his nasty role. Rambo transforms from put-upon victim to survivalist warrior, taking on a small army of cops in a wilderness showdown. When this debuted (1982), there was nothing like it, making the raw, kill-or-be-killed nature of FB all the more shocking and exhilarating! In addition to its action elements, this film had a heart for the vets, telling some of their story in the process.

[OK, Rambo's speech at the end is still clunky, and I *had* noticed that before. But other things ... ]

The first more-than-half offers several thoughtful elements -- for instance, the hunting of Rambo through the ""jungle"" of the mountain/forests. It hearkens to the book, I bet, which was (yes, really) an anti-war effort that was studied in high school literature classes. Before the movie came around, of course.

Author David Morrell has written about the differences -- in the book after the movie came out, and in his own life after the same event. The book wasn't taught any further in high school, for starters. Morrell talks about hiring a lawyer to negotiate the movie rights, and the attorney returned in high spirits because he'd secured sequel rights, action figures and other licensing, etc.

Morrell was a little surprised since the book doesn't end quite like the movie does and the lawyer said, ""Hmm, you don't know much about the film business, do you?""

Morrell's own life changed as well. He made a good deal of money from the film franchise but lost the character he'd created in John Rambo.

See the film, perhaps again, and then read the book, if you haven't already.

Here is a returning combat veteran who is not only actually an escaped POW, but also a Green Beret and even a Medal of Honor winner, and when the police of a small Northwestern town cross him, Rambo dutifully goes out of his honorably discharged mind.  It's a great combat drama, if you're into macho. impossible odds last stands (and what young man at some point isn't?), but don't make the mistake of thinking this was the typical return to home most veterans (at least mentally) went through,  It took a few years, but most went back into civilian life without too much readjustment difficulty.  Stallone had the looks (and the build) of some kind of roman God at that point, and Hollywood made the most of it.  When it came out, I read that it had been shot in Oregon, but apparently I was mistaken,  It was shot, of all places, in British Columbia, Canada, and to see somebody  supposedly trained in the tropical climate of Vietnam in open territory in midwinter, covered with only an open leather jerkin is a little hard to believe, even if the guy is off his coming-home rocker.  Also, those mountains would most likely be found in Laos.  It's Reagan-lifornia of course.

71865,5,0784011370,"FIRST BLOOD started it all. FIRST BLOOD is about a Vietnam vet named John Rambo who comes to a small town in Washington state to find one of his friends from his unit in Vietnam. When he is informed that he is dead, Rambo makes his way into this small backwoods town. He ends up being arrested by the hick local sheriff played by Brian Dennehy. While in custody, the sheriff's bumpkins abuse Rambo and he manages to escape and starts what turns out to an all out manhunt and war of survival. Thus, the stage is set for this psychological action film directed by Ted Kotcheff.

We learn that John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a former member of an elite United States Army Special Forces unit and he has been awarded the Medal of Honor. The relentless music score by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography by Andrew Laszlo makes FIRST BLOOD and all the dynamics of the film all the more real.

A highlight of the film and moving force in the series is Richard Crenna's performance as the United States Special Forces Colonel Sam Trautman. When Trautman arrives at the base camp of the local and sate police, he explains that he trained Rambo, and that the Army sent him to ""rescue"" them from Rambo. The national guard was sent out to capture Rambo, but they don't stand a chance.

Trautman explains, ""You don't seem to want to accept the fact you're dealing with an expert in guerrilla warfare, with a man who's the best, with guns, with knives, with his bare hands. A man who's been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke. In Vietnam his job was to dispose of enemy personnel. To kill! Period! Win by attrition. Well Rambo was the best."" Take it from there.

The rest is film history. Both Rambo and Trautman seems like tormented individuals. What was in each man and what drove them to such an uncertain camaraderie. Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna make these characters and emotions and drive real. This is a good film.",1415145600,,1999,4.544444444444444

71886,5,0784011370,"First Blood. Those two words are enough to make you cringe. But in a good way. Sylvester Stallone stepped away from his Rocky Balboa boxer shorts long enough to give us John Rambo and boy are we glad he did! One of Sly's best roles, he plays a scarred veteran wandering the Pacific Northwest hoping to find a member of his old Green Beret outfit. It's a sad trip to memory lane when he finds out his friend not only lost the war, he lost his battle with cancer as well. Heartbroken and lonely, Rambo wanders into a two-bit town looking for his next meal. Unfortunately, he's not dressed for the occasion. In his green army jacket, long hair, and boots, he looks like the drifter he is. When he settles onto his bar stool for something warm and greasy, Brian Dennehy's Sheriff Teasle isn't pleased. Okay, so maybe Rambo has gone a long stretch without his trusty Irish Spring soap, but is that enough to harass the guy out of town?

Poor Sheriff Teasle makes the mistake of offering to drive the malodorous army vet to the edge of town and tells him to take a hike and a shower. But because Rambo's still hungry, disobeys and is immediately thrust into a battle of wills that makes WWII look like a cakewalk! Soon, our PTSD stricken hero is dragged back to town, fingerprinted, and booked by an ornery deputy who should really give up his badge for something a little more in keeping with the Gestapo. Rambo is stripped, hosed down, and shaved bare. It's enough to bring out those pesky memories of being tortured in NAM.

Unable to control himself. Rambo panics and unleashes hell on the unsuspecting deputies and fellow toadies. A young David Caruso is on hand to provide some much-needed compassion and sympathy. But not much as Rambo is pursued by Brian Dennehy's Teasle, who obviously is suffering from bored-to death-cause-he's-got-nothing-to-do-all-day-so-I'll-harrass-this-innocent-man. Well, I guess town life is just too quiet for the sheriff who seems to be bearing a grudge against the tortured veteran and gives chase. First with a squad car, then bloodhounds, feckless deputies, and a deranged head deputy armed with insanity and a rifle, decide Rambo needs to be exterminated. He's chased up a cliff and nosedives into a tree. But not before the crazed head deputy buys the farm by way of falling to his death. I wasn't sorry.

Stallone really makes you root for the hero. And boy, what a hero! Rambo takes his Green Beret training to the next level and Deputy Dawg and his cohorts are ripe for the picking. One by one, they fall prey to Rambo's expert guerrilla and survival training. None of them stand a chance, and it's fun to watch the prey hunt the hunters. But soon, the sheriff realizes he may have bitten off more than he can chew. Richard Crenna is brought in to contain the one-man army before he kills them all.

One of the best action films of the last fifty years, you won't be disappointed in Rambo's journey from war hero to a broken man who finds that his special skills don't matter in the real world. They might fend off a crazed sheriff out for blood, but for Rambo, killing a man with your bare hands just won't pay the bills.

Five stars for Stallone who proved he wasn't a one-off, and Brian Dennehy as an unhinged small town sheriff who's so bored with his mundane life that he has to harass Vietnam veterans just because they haven't bathed in a week. Next time, just give the man some pancakes!!

*For a companion to this, I highly recommend Hot Shots: Part Deux. Richard Crenna reprises his role as the Col. (sort of) and Charlie Sheen skewers just about every First Blood movie ever made.",1411603200,,3630,4.6114551083591335

71897,5,0784011370,"First Blood is action thriller about a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam War veteran named John Rambo. The story of the film is about an ex-Green Beret John Rambo,who is targeted for persecution and abuse by potbellied Sheriff Will Teasle. When he can stand no more, Rambo goes bonkers, killing a deputy and heading into the surrounding hills, armed to the teeth. After he has picked off practically every law enforcement officer within a radius of 50 miles,the local authorities bring in his former commanding officer, Trautman,who suggested that the locals had better get a lot of body bags ready.

It has been a critical and commercial success and has had a lasting influence on action films for it was notable for its psychological portrayal of the after-effects of the Vietnam War faced by American veterans attempting to re-integrate into society. Added to that,it has created a benchmark about what action movies will be all about in the years to come since its theatrical release.

Last night I decided to pop in First Blood and relive a little 1982 movie-making nostalgia.  It had been a few years since I watched any of the Rambo movies, possibly because of all the hype and the backlash from all of the copycat films that followed. Much to my delight, having let the veil of simmering petulance drop, I found a great story unfolding before me.
We all know the plot, right?
John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), ex-Green Beret, Congressional Medal Of Honor Winner, killing machine, is wandering through the Pacific Northwest, looking up a former war buddy, only to discover that he has been dead for a year or more from cancer.  Moving along, Rambo finds himself drifting into the small town of Hope,WA, where he is immediately zeroed in on by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy). Teasle wants Rambo gone immediately, and offers him a ride to the edge of town, smacking him with insolent remarks the entire way.  When Rambo asks if there is a place he might eat, Teasle tells him, sure, there's a diner 30 miles down the innerstate.  He wants this scraggly drifter gone from his little town.  After being dropped off, and with a freezing rain beginning, Rambo decides to turn back toward Hope to find some food.  Teasle is not happy and the abuse begins.  Taken into custody, Rambo is led to the Sheriff's station where a group of hillbilly cops proceed to abuse him in every way they can.  In an attempt to ""clean him up"" before he goes before the judge on trumped up vagrancy charges, one deputy holds him while another attempts to shave him with a gleaming straight-razor.  Rambo, flashing back to his torture in a Vietnamese prison camp, goes berserk, knocks the cops silly, snatches his 14 inch survival knife, and flees for the hills with all of Hope's police force in tow.  Once inside the forested hills, the game switches sides, and who is now hunting who? Enter Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna) who shows up to assist with Rambo's defusing. ""God didn't imcreate Rambo, I did.""  He tries to warn Teasle to back off and let Rambo go, but there is no reasoning with the angered Sheriff despite all the warnings Troutman issues.
What people often tend to forget, when remembering First Blood, is that Rambo kills no one (4 people die accidentally).  He could have.  He could have killed each and every one of the men chasing him, but that is for the sequels.  Initially, the filmmakers were sticking to the novel, and Rambo dies at the end by Col. Troutman's hand.  But after test-screenings and poor reactions, they decided to let him live.  Frist Blood started not only a very successful franchise, but launched an action genre as well.  Stallone is quiet (until his final breakdown at the film's end) and so painfully believable.  A true badass with deep emotional issues.  The ultimate anti-hero. And audiences back in 1982 loved him.  Rambo became a running joke towards the end of the 80s as the sequels (as well as the ripoffs) proved to tarnish what had been set down in the initial film.  But when you cut that all away, what you are left with is First Blood, and it stands alone as not only one of Stallone's top performances (if not his best) but a thinking man's movie about the dishonor shed upon returning Vietnam vets and the terrors they keep within themselves.

The story is straight forward and begins immediately, kind of disturbing actually but a great one to sink your teeth into if in the mood.

71938,4,0784011370,"John Rambo(Sylvester Stallone) is a former United States Special Forces soldier who fought in Vietnam and won the Congressional Medal of Honor, but his time in Vietnam still haunts him. As he came to Hope, Washington to visit a friend, he was guided out of town by an abusive small-town Sheriff William Teasel(Brian Dennehy) who insults Rambo, but what Teasel does not know that his insult angered Rambo to the point where Rambo became violent and was arrested, as he was at the county jail being cleaned, he escapes and goes on a rampage through the forest to try to escape from the Sheriff and his fellow deputies who want to kill him. Then, as Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Samuel Trautman(Richard Crenna) tries to save both the Sheriff's Dept. and Rambo before the situation gets out of hand., but Rambo is the one-man Army who is pushed to the edge by the sheriff starting a personal war between Rambo and anyone else who gets in his way.

This action flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 10 years old in the 4th grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1982 and when Ronald Reagan was our president and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-82.",1389139200,,1224,4.513513513513513
71939,5,0784011370,"Through his long career Sylvester Stallone has become known for his action films starring in films such as The Expendables, Cobra, and Judge Dredd yet for all the action films Stallone has starred in his best action film is one of his firsts in 1982's First Blood. That is what I have thought of the film for a long time, but after recently watching First Blood again after at least a half decade I still feel the same way about First Blood, which is wonderfully paced, and filmed film.

The film follows a Green Beret Vietnam veteran John Rambo, who is drifter moving one place to the next. After discovering a fellow veteran Delmar Berry is dead Rambo wonders into the small town of Hope, Washington where sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) rules. Teasle thinking Rambo is just some poor hobo decides to take Rambo to the other side of town saying his kind isn't welcome in his quiet small town. Rambo heads back into town just wanting to get something to eat, and find a nice place to sleep. Teasle being the abusive cop doesn't give Rambo a break, and just arrests the man throwing the man in jail, and letting do whatever they want, which wasn't a smart move when he's dealing with Rambo an ex-special forces vet who's most likely suffering from disillusionment and Post traumatic stress disorder, but Teasle and his men didn't know it at the time. Things quickly escalate as Rambo violently escapes, goes on the run into the mountains of Washington, and to the climax in Hope.

There have been many films about the impact of the Vietnam War had on the men who fought in the war, the response the citizens had toward the war and the veterans, and the veterans adjusting to returning home from Born on the 4th of July to Coming Home, and Taxi Driver yet I don't think any film had done it in such a violent way at the time, and it works as the action is riveting especially in the mountains as the police and Rambo hunt one another. Sylvester Stallone did a pretty good job editing and writing the screenplay whether intentional or not Stallone smartly keeps Rambo's dialogue to a minimum and instead let's himself act using his eyes, body language, and his interaction with the environment. Where things start to go downhill with the script is when Stallone actually has some dialogue and decided to beat us over our head with the message. Yes war is horrifying and had a devastating impact on the soldiers, and yes the treatment many Vietnam vets received during the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's by citizens wasn't always kind and excepting, but Stallone with his script didn't have to get on his soap box, and even worse he shouldn't have been the one to give the speeches especially with all the violence going on around him which takes away some of the meaning in Rambo's words.

First Blood is based on the book with the same name by David Morrell. While I haven't read the novel I have read the synopsis of the book, and would have preferred the films climax to be more closely aligned to the climax of the novel which we almost got in the draft screenplay of the film in which Rambo kills himself, but Stallone didn't like the darker draft and ending opting for a more hopeful one. Though I did enjoy the ending of First Blood I think the darker ending would have had more of a lasting impact.

While the script wasn't perfect I do like the casting of the film. Sylvester Stallone may not be a great actor, but he does have the body to pull of the role of John Rambo as he had proven in the first three Rocky films. Brian Dennehy was great as Teasle showing in his performance that Teasle is more than just an abusive small town sheriff. Richard Crenna in the only role he will be remembered for gives meaningful performance as Colonel Sam Trautman. Crenna gives more meaning to his dialogue and performance than Stallone does in his long speeches especially in the climax.

The action in First Blood might be considered low key compared to modern action films, but that is one of the reasons why First Blood is so good as a ton of action isn't needed to make a good action film if it is done right. The long chase through the mountains of Washington was beautifully filmed. The scenes along some rocky cliffs as a helicopter chases after Rambo is really good, and the climax in the tone of Hope as Rambo methodically attacks the town in search of Teasle is really well thought out.

Sylvester Stallone has been in a tone of action films, and most with a lot more action than First Blood has, but that isn't the reason why First Blood is my favorite Stallone action film. It is a combination of things that include a real meaning a message behind the action that the majority of his latter films lacked. That along with the quality acting of the lead actors, and the low key action compared to modern and even action films of the time makes First Blood Stallone's best action film, and probably his best film outside of the first three Rocky films. I know people are enamored with average Expendables films, but I'd recommend they check out Stallone in his heyday before the disappointing Escape Plan and Expendable films with his best action film in First Blood.",1389052800,,5174,4.534261241970022

71949,5,0784011370,"These days, the character of John Rambo has become synonymous with the loud, dumb explosion-fests that were most 1980s' action movies, that few remember he originally started as a much more intelligent and complex character. 1982's ""First Blood,"" the first (and best) of the trilogy, showcases the character as a vulnerable warrior trying to survive in a world that refuses to respect him.

Rambo (Sylvester Stallone in an iconic performance that rivals the first ""Rocky"" as the best of his career) is a former Vietnam veteran who spent several years in POW camp before coming home to a country that viewed him as the villain. Homeless and alone, Rambo wanders from town to town searching for his old buddies from service, all of whom have passed on. One day he wanders into a small town run by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who doesn't take kindly to Rambo's presence; suspecting him to be a dangerous drifter, Teasle forces Rambo out of town, refusing to provide him with food or any hospitality. Insulted for being treated like a criminal for no reason, Rambo wanders back to town, for which Teasle promptly arrests him for vagrancy. While in custody, the deputies at the station subject Rambo to harsh treatment that brings traumatic flashbacks to his time as a prisoner of war. Distraught, Rambo breaks free from custody and ignites a local manhunt that puts the whole town on edge as Rambo draws on every tactic he relied on in Vietnam to help him survive against a ruthless band of policeman who are unprepared against a trained killing machine who's been pushed over the edge. Eventually, the National Guard, green berets and Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna) are called in to insist the hapless police force, while warning them that Rambo is no ordinary fugitives and is next to impossible to take down.

The action sequences are intense and violent without being comically over the top as in the sequels; there are several quiet, intense moments that delve into Rambo's troubled psyche as well as Teasle's own warped motivations. The film accurately portrays the devastating treatment Vietnam veterans were met with upon returning home, culminating in Rambo's explosive breakdown at the finale, perhaps Stallone's finest moment as an actor.

Give me Bronson, Eastwood, or even Bruce Lee but spare me those who can't even pronounce their own names.  That said - & please forgive my self-indulgence - First Blood is a pretty cool movie.  Stallone is a little too intense, Willis would've been a little too cool for it & Schwarzenegger too goofy.  The best part about First Blood is it has a fairly good story-line; simplistic though it is, it's easy to follow & to get where both the protagonist & antagonist are coming from.

First Blood is the first Rambo movie and my favorite because it does such a good job of developing the character. Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo, a man who has lost everything and experienced unimaginable suffering, both physical and emotional, just wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, he lives in a world that persecutes what it doesn't understand, and he soon finds himself in violent conflict with Sheriff Teasle, expertly played by Brian Dennehy. Teasle cares little for Rambo's problems and simply wants to punish loiterers. When he and his men push the war hero too far, Rambo's training--and PTSD--kick in and he explodes into the Oregon wilderness, bent on finishing what they started.

First Blood also has my favorite movie scene: the climactic and heart-wrenching finale between Rambo and his father figure Colonel Trautman (the incomparable Richard Crenna). In this scene, Rambo goes into graphic detail concerning the suffering he endured in 'Nam and when he got back home to a world he didn't recognize and who suddenly hated him. He is a tragic figure who only wants the pain to stop, but he doesn't know how to achieve that. Having been to that place myself, I relate to him more than any other fictional character.

First Blood is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.",1367539200,,1394,4.852941176470588

 John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) comes from Kingsman, Arizona. He is traveling to Oregon to find his Vietnam war buddy. He finds out he died last year of cancer due to Agent Orange. Very disappointed, he starts walking to Holidayland in Washington. Sheriff Teasle (Brian Dennehy) notices the Army green jacket with the American flag and offers Rambo a ride. He told Teasle he wants to go to Portland, Oregon. Teasle says that is south, not north. Rambo wants him to stop the car so he can get something to eat. Teasle says, ""we don't like drifters in this town"". He drops him off at the bridge in the direction of Portland. After the cop car leaves, Rambo walks back across the bridge and Teasle sees him in the left side mirror. He meets up with Rambo and starts harassing him and finds a knife on him. He takes him to the police station where he is harassed some more. Rambo remembers when he was abused and held captive in Vietnam. He was a Green Beret war hero. Rambo escapes from the police station and a manhunt begins. Cat and mouse.

Released soon after the third installment of the Rocky franchise, this first Rambo film is by far the best of the lot, absent the heavy jingoism of the sequels. Casting Stallone in the familiar David-against-Goliath role works well here, particularly with the Jerry Goldsmith score. Whatever people may say about Sly and his limited range, he has always played the underdog well. Strong cast, especially Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna.

The film steers clear of killing Rambo; the book's ending was clearly not made-for-Hollywood. Rest assured, the final monologue here packs plenty of figurative punch. Relevant social commentary on Vietnam, too, a scant eight years after the U.S. withdrawal.

I think that if they ended the movie after the first hour, it would have been better though. And, here is why ( i will try not to spoil the movie) basically, the movie starts and is non-stop action until it climax's (with a knife against a man's throath and rambo saying I could easilly kill all of you) and then after that it becomes less awesome. Personnaly though I don't care because it is so intense, and so .... I meen rambo has a knife ( a big knife) and can easilly live in the woods like hes in Vietnam. And he has about 6 men chasing him in the woods, and only one of them thinks its a bad idea, (Haratio Kane from CSI). That being said, they know who he is and still want to kill him.  So, the vengeance is there and I feel like rambo should peel there flesh off bit-by-bit when he gets the chance, and when he doesn't it doesn't make him less of a man. I don't understand his choices though, and maybe I am just too far gone and want to see some heads roll. But, not very many heads roll. And that is what I will say, watch this and be amazaed at Sylvester Stallone in all his bad-ass glory, just don't be too upset when the ending is kind of a let down. A lot of action, and a lot of blood, and even some scenes where rambo is sewing up open wounds, and splinting broken bones. No detail is left out in these scenes, so maybe the faint at heart stay away from this flick? all you go-hards grab this, and I would check out best buy first (especially if you have best buy gift cards)",1346716800,,1641,3.987841945288754
71982,5,0784011370,"The ultimate edition dvd I just bought and promptly received has the Sly Stallone commentary thank you very much,one of the most underrated actors in movie history. Lefties love to wax cynical about him for political reasons.

Any actor who becomes his character inside-out and outside-in,who puts in all effort required before and during production,that kind of extreme method actor is the genuine article and rare. Especially back when most actors were wimps or egomaniacs--wait until you here what Sly reveals about Kirk Douglas,WOW!

No,Kirk Douglas didn't make it into the movie. THANK GOD!

Sly's feature length commentary was excellent,very insightful and humorous. Great anecdotes..He did engage in some ego-tripping for a moment ridiculing a supporting actor who only did what he was told. But then Sly went back to being more humble and appreciative.

I have to disagree also about this one brief scene that Sly apparently hated,which provide a stark contrast between what a Green Beret is vs the weekend warriors pursuing him. I didn't think this contrast was comical,I thought it was essential...Yes,as Sly put it,there was two different movies for a moment,by design. The director wanted to show what a farce this story could have been without a divinely inspired director who was definitely on Stallone's side all the way..This contrast made Stallone's character more real.

Feature length audio commentary! Accept no substitutes!..Thru the commentary you get to watch a favorite movie from someone else's perspective,which is almost like watching the movie for the first time. And you learn stuff that you would have never known without the commentary...This is what really distinguishes dvd from vhs.

71984,4,0784011370,"A victim of post traumatic stress, Viet Nam War veteran John Rambo snaps, and applies his formidable fighting skills against law enforcement, in First Blood (1982), a film that would prove to be influential in how American soldiers from this conflict were then portrayed in film.  First Blood takes a simple storyline, and develops it to utilize Stallone's unique physically abilities.  Directed by Ted Kotcheff (Law and Order SVU), the film is stylishly violent, but also has some underlying messages.  The blockbuster sequel, Rambo: First Blood Part 2 (1985), further altered the perception of the Viet Nam vet from a shell-shocked dysfunctional individual in a failed war, to a mythical and heroic battle hardened fighting machine.  Among others, Chuck Norris' Missing in Action films were an offshoot of the Rambo phenomenon.

Having already played a police detective in the crime thriller Nighthawks (1981), Sylvester Stallone continued to expand the range of his film roles.  Already an accomplished screenwriter for the Rocky films, Stallone's screenplay for First Blood is also tailored to feature his awesome physical skills.  Stallone is John Rambo, an ex-soldier, and Medal of Honor awardee, who comes to Washington state to look up an old army buddy, only to discover that he has died.  Passing through a small town, Rambo is hassled by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), and winds up in jail, where he has some flashbacks connected to his war experiences, and goes berserk.  After attacking some officers, and stealing a motorcycle, Rambo escapes into the woods, where he employs his combat skills to hold the police, and later the National Guard at bay.

Matters intensify, as Rambo strikes back, and his former commanding officer Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) appears on the scene to provide advice to the authorities.  Events are a bit clichd, as the story begins on pretty solid ground, and then gradually elevates to pure fantasy, as Rambo is trapped inside a mine, miraculously manages to find a way out, and then bent on revenge, makes his way back to town.  After all the mayhem, Rambo's rambling emotional breakdown in town's the police station, makes for an oddly anticlimactic finish, to what is otherwise a very engaging fast paced adventure, enlivened by Jerry Goldsmith's score.  Stallone excels in the physically challenging role, which like Rocky Balboa, would become one of several icons in his long career.  The trend toward fantasy and the remolding of history would become more pronounced in the sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-First-Blood-Part-II/dp/B0015XHP3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo - First Blood Part II</a>, where John Rambo returns to Viet Nam to rescue prisoners of war.",1339718400,2,2789,5.455813953488372
71985,5,0784011370,"All Stallone haters should see the first Rocky and the first Rambo. Both movies are great and although Rocky is better, Rambo is almost as good. Stallone is of course not a Shakespearian actor, but here he is really in his element - John Rambo is after all a devastated, battlescarred veteran, who clearly was not great in social contacts (or great verbal communication) even before the Vietnam War, but who now is really close to a human wreck, with autistic tendancies.

In fact, this movie is about a lonely, impoverished, homeless and deeply depressed man who at one moment turns back and bites the bullies in police uniforms who (really sadistically) abuse him, just because he wanted to buy something to eat in the wrong little town. When it finally appears how dangerous he is, he becomes the target of a manhunt, which ultimately gets totally out of proportion.

There will be no more details - if you didn't see it yet, you deserve to be surprised. The only thing I am ready to reveal is that the National Guard is providing one of the (few) humorous moments in the movie... Stallone gives a very good performance, and Brian Dennehy (the ""redneck"" sheriff) and Richard Crenna (colonel of Green Berets) are even better. I always liked this movie and always felt a great pity for the main character.

Once this film gets kick started around 10 minutes in, it doesn't let you go.  By far one of Stallone's best performances, on par with his role in COPLAND, not to mention Rocky.

As an action film it's great, as a comment on the times and the stigma attached to Vietnam vets returning from the war, even better.

I didn't watch this film for years just because I assumed it wasn't worth the time.  Once a very good friend of mine forced me to sit down and watch, I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it years prior.

Even if you don't care for Stallone that much, you might reconsider checking him out in this one.  I'm not saying he'll change your mind about a career worth of so-so films, but he might just win you over for life on this film alone.

Now that I've lambasted Sly's career of movie choices, I must back track and say, even though they aren't brilliant on a ""good"" level the following are brilliant on a ""so-bad-it's-good"" level:  COBRA, ROCKY III, and OVER THE TOP.  There are certainly more to choose from, but I rank those as pretty high.

I also think some of the other music was also good. I think Jerry Goldsmith was a great composer.

Picture Quality: 4/5

I liked the picture quality much more than the audio quality. I didn`t expect it to look so clear and detailed. I think the colours and such look clear. Just look how detailed the blood looks. I expected it to look far worse than this, so i was happy with the picture quality.

Audio Quality: 2.5/5

I was very disappointed with the audio quality. They didn`t restore the DTS- HD High Resolution 5.1 as well as the picture quality. The DTS-HD HR isn`a a lossless format either. It`s more like a high end lossy format. Nearly everything in this remix sounds tinny and flat. I think the explosions had ok bass, but all the gunfire effects sounds like cap guns. I also think the dialog was mixed too low in the Center speaker. I had to crank up the volume on the Center speaker each time there was a dialog scene.

Not good. I think the dialog at times sounded tinny. The Rear speakers was mostly used in action scenes, but they also used for music. I think the rears could have been used a bit more, but ok. This is certainly not the film to impress your friends with, audio wise, of course. Too bad those in charge of the DTS- HD High Resolution 5.1, couldn`t restore/remix it much better than this very disappointing audio track. Hm.

71998,5,0784011370,"The script for ""First Blood"" was floating around Hollywood for some time before director Ted Kotcheff signed on to direct the film and Stallone signed on to star in and do the screenplay. Part of what makes ""First Blood"" so great is the political realness of it. The way that Rambo was treated is the way a lot of other Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home.

""First Blood"" is about Vietnam vet John Rambo. The film starts out were we see Rambo walking down a road, to find Delmare Berry. He is the last living member of the team that he served together on in Vietnam. Rambo learns that Delmare was killed by agent orange cancer. Having no where else to go, Rambo wonders into a small town called Hope. The Sheriff named Teasle stops him and offers him a ride to the edge of town. Teasle tells Rambo he does not want drifters in his town. Teasle drops Rambo off at the South end of Town and while he drives away, he sees Rambo walking back into Town. This causes Rambo to get arrested. While in the police station, Rambo has flashbacks to his torture in Vietnam which causes him to escape. With the help of Rambo's Colonel from Vietnam, Teasle is on the hunt for Rambo.

The acting in ""First Blood"" is Oscar worthy. Sylvester Stallone playing John Rambo, does a wonderful job. There is not a whole lot of dialogue for Stallone in this film, but he makes it work. Also, with his breakdown at the end, which is incredible goes a long way and is personally relatable to Vietnam veterans.
Also, Brian Dennehy who plays Sheriff Teasle, does a great job. His character is an overweight, but tough cop. He never gives up on the search for Rambo, even when the higher authorities come in.
The character  Colonel Sam Trautman played by Richard Crenna is a noteworthy performance. Trautman is not directly involved in the search for Rambo, however since Rambo has no family or friends, Trautman is the only person he can trust.

Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for his ""Rambo"" and ""Rocky"" films. However, ""First Blood"" is Stallone's best individual film.
Finally, ""First Blood"" is not solely an action film, it is a mix between action and drama.",1288915200,,2160,4.573643410852713

The movie came just one hour ago, and I was very impressed with it's speedy service. And I have nothing against the movie or Stallone's way of acting, which was just right considering his big Rambo debut of 1982. But the condition of the DVD cover forces me to rate it 4 out of 5 stars. Of course, I bought it used for a good price, but one of the snaps which keeps the DVD cover closed is broken and half the plastic cover on the back had peeled off, not to mention the disc wasn't all the way on it's holder, which could've gotten it scratched up if the disc was handled in an improper way, but it wasn't. I just have to mention that it DID say on the order purchase, ""Minor wear to case."" But this seems a lot more than minor to me.

72001,5,0784011370,"...instead, remind yourself that Sylvester Stallone is largely responsible for creating at least two of the best-known characters in the history of U.S. and world cinema:  Rambo and Rocky.  These characters are probably as well-known throughout the world as any U.S. President, Chairman Mao, or Jesus Christ.  Name someone else with a comparable accomplishment.  That could take a moment, so take a moment and have another look at Rambo.

When I go back and look at this film, I have to admit, Stallone's forays into verbal expression aside, I really like this movie.  Relatively low budget, fairly realistic action, and with the usual solid performances from Crenna and Dennehy, who play a Special Forces Colonel and a small-town Sheriff, respectively.  But the real winner is the script, which had the audacity to express the thoughts and feelings of the much maligned and disregarded Vietnam veteran.  This film is not really an action flick, or a movie about a loner.  Stallone portrays a veteran just back from the war, who, while passing through a small town, just wants to mind his own business but is hassled by the local sheriff (Dennehy).  After being arrested and treated with disdain, Rambo responds with finely tuned violence.  From his perspective, he is doing no more than demanding his rights and just due.

Like a lot of veterans at the time, he has difficulty reconciling the sacrifices he and his fellow servicemen made in Vietnam on behalf of what seems to be an ungrateful nation (in my mind, this film is also in sympathy with the even more neglected Korean War veterans).  It seems that Stallone was expressing, however crudely, the rarely spoken sentiments of many at the time.  It also seems to me that the story is not a new one, but one that has and will play out time and again all over the world.  But the fact remains that Stallone's version is quite memorable...name recognition alone speaks to the impact of the film.

So I urge you to have another look at how the movie was made, and put the plot and whatever message you derive from it into historical perspective...I daresay that an honest look will make it more difficult to condescend to Mr. Stallone, let alone veterans of Vietnam, Korea, and, alas, the GWOT.

72004,5,0784011370,"A lot of people would likely classify this film as an ""action movie."" While there is certainly some great action sequences to be found here, it is really so much more than that. ""First Blood"" is something more than the typical shoot 'em up action epic, as it has the undertones of some very definite political themes and societal messages that most mere ""action movies"" never do.

Aside from Rocky Balboa, John J. Rambo is without question the most iconic character in Sylvester Stallone's long career. And of the two, he is certainly the more emotionally complex. A man of deep loyalties and convictions, he is also easily able to shun aside the moralities of the supposed civilized world and, when provoked, become little more than a killing machine. It is this duality of a man who simply wants a quiet place for himself in the world, yet who is capable of committing some of the most outrageous acts of violence ever seen, that is what make the character so compelling.

But it isn't simply Sly's performance as Rambo that gives the film such resonance. Equally adding the this potent dramatic brew are veteran actors Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. While Sly spends most of the film running through forests and slogging through tunnels, the interaction between Dennehy and Crenna's characters brilliantly encapsulate the clash of political views at the story's core.

As noted the action scenes are very well done here. They almost make you believe that Rambo could single-handedly take down an entire town. They never go too far, or become too outlandish, with things. They keep it feeling just realistic enough to add the much needed tension for the inevitable showdown at the film's end. Adding to this is the stellar musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is just the perfect compliment to the story unfolding. It never distracts you from what's occurring on screen and, in fact, enhances the emotions of the situations even more. Just what any good score should do.

What more can be said about this film, that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? The film would create a cultural icon that would embody the decade of the 80's, as well as inspire sequel films for over 20 years. But while those sequels would easily up the ante in terms of non-stop action, they would never attain the same level of emotional drama that this film does. ""First Blood"" was a film that asked a lot of hard questions about a war, and it's aftermath, that had no easy answers. And that, above all else, is what makes it more than merely ""another 80's action movie."" It makes it a classic!",1272585600,,2592,4.753333333333333

72006,5,0784011370,"First Blood was Sylvester Stallone's first entry into the Vietnam War vet genre. It was note worthy for many reasons. Championing the need to address Vietnam vet problems in a return to society, reducing the intro to the heroes character & leaving the body of the film for the confrontations, scenes well done such as the escape, the hideaway, the sheriff's station & the shooting done around the town of Hope not to mention the great scenes filmed of the Canadian wilderness.

John Rambo is a Vietnam vet that can't find a decent job & isn't sure why (as he states ""in the field I was in charge of millions of dollars worth of equipment). Traveling into the northwest to visit an old army buddy he discovers the buddy died from Cancer (Agent Orange here). Wondering through Hope, Oregon Rambo meets the local Sheriff. He & his office do not like long hair & outta work bums. In other words if you look incompetent, smell incompetent & get tagged incompetent by this power fed country boy. You are open game. He is after all the law & the law overrules all.

The target here though is a Green Beret. One of the most highly decorated Green Berets from the Vietnam War. He didn't work as a team. His job was to operate as a lone wolf. Searching for & removing Vietcong leaders wherever they could be found. His survival skills are immense. His reaction to attack is lethal.

Green Berets are made & used by the US Government. That's Col. Trautman's entry for this show. Col. Trautman comes out to do damage control on one of the army's rampaging beasts according to the Sheriff. You get to make up your own mind on why Trautman's there though. A strong Vietnam era statement was made by this movie. I remember the talk on the street afterwards. The storyline in the movie is so well handled. I hear stuff like ""I read the book & it's not like the movie"". So- this is a movie review. The plot is good even if there is 6 books or no book.

The acting in this show is what put it up for 5 stars from me. Stallone plays the brooding, physically dominant, pool of deep anger that is somehow bewildered & almost innocent so well. Brian Dennehy & Jack Starrett as a Sheriff Office tag team are unequalled. Richard Crenna who was a last second replacement plays the role of the Devil's henchman as he did in Body Heat. He was a great late arrival. You even get a part out of David Caruso who is a lot more famous now. Bill McKinney as the State Police Capt. had little to do here but performed well in what he was given to do.

5 STARS for a 1982 film!",1267142400,2,2542,4.343157894736842

72008,5,0784011370,"Starring the one and only Sylvester Stallone, ""First Blood"" introduces the world to the legendary action hero John Rambo, in the first of four confusingly titled films. Directed by Ted Kotcheff (""Weekend at Bernie's"") and co-starring Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna and a young David Caruso, the film is as notorious for its extensive action scenes as it is for the intense and iconic performance put forth by Stallone, who is also credited for writing the screenplay.

 Ex-Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran John Rambo is passing through a small town after learning of the death of a member of his unit, and all he wants is something to eat. The local sheriff (Dennehy) doesn't take too kindly to him, however, and after he breaks out of jail, a strong disagreement turns into a full-scale war, with Rambo at odds against the town's police force. Not only does he make a fool of the sheriff, but in his wake, leaves a trail of destruction all on his own that only serves to match the amount of rage and alienation built up inside of him.

Despite laying the violence on a bit thick, the film never cheapens or lowers itself to average action-filler. At the heart of it, it's a story about a man's mental disintegration following a failed attempt at re-entering society. Stallone's speech during his breakdown towards the end of the film not only shows significant range for the actor, but also marks a rare occurrence where an action film attempts to address a painful but all too true reality. ""Rambo"" is not only a great action film, but a gritty and raw one that feels real and human at the same time. Action films just don't get better than this, although the three sequels that followed sure did try.",1262649600,,1705,4.676666666666667

72010,3,0784011370,"This comment is for the Blu-ray copy. I was hoping for more from the audio/video presentation. The image at the very beginning is awful, but it soon shapes up to be mostly pleasing as long as I lower the black level and up the contrast on my calibrated display. The sound is an improvement over the DVD, but not by much. At least I can hear the dialogue clearly now, but the sound effects of the guns and explosions and thunder could have been updated. With the filmmakers still being alive, I would think that they'd be interested in advancing the presentation by updating the sound design a bit. I know if I had made this film and I had newer and better resources at my disposal today, I would certainly take advantage of the current technology and up the ante on this baby. An extreme, but perfect example is the recent Criterion release of Chungking Express. What Wong Kar Wai did was take a lackluster mono sound design and create an entirely new soundfield mix that really elevates the viewing experience. It's important to enhance the viewing experience when possible, especially since the way we watch films today has changed so drastically from the days of VHS, and I've no doubt that it will continue to advance in ways we may not envision at this time. There is no harm in giving films like this a boost, as long as it doesn't stray from the original intent of the sound's design.

Considering how cheap this film is on blu-ray, I would say it is worth the dough.",1253664000,3,1474,4.5

72012,5,0784011370,"The name Rambo brings to mind wild action as a one man army takes on 100's if not thousands of the enemy.  Blood, guts, and a high body count.

First Blood is before that nonsense.  Before the action movie hype.  It has a story that really has not played out in other movies as much.  We see a lot of movies like Full metal Jacket and Platoon but how about a serious movie about what happens to our boys once they come home?  Flags of our Fathers attempted this but not like the First Blood.

The plot is the core of this movie.  Rambo returns from Nam to find a world different than the one he left behind.  Almost everyone he cared about has died and he caries a huge mental and physical burden from his service in Asia.  Without giving too much away Rambo must trys to comform back into the world but can not adapt.  He is still haunted by the ghosts of his past and when a arrogant jerk of a Sheriff and one of his henchmen abuse Rambo then he snaps back into the jungle mentality.

This movie has a little bit of action but not much.  In fact the 'body count' is very very small.  Rambo does not want a fight, he just wants to surive and does his best to do so without hurting the people he was fighting for and sacrificed so much.

The Blu Ray looks amazing and gives incredible detail.  There were a lot of dark sceens which made the old VHS and DVD harder to see certain parts like at night or in the caves but here it comes out much better.

If you want some a solid story about a topic we do not hear much about, then Rambo is your movie.  Do not over look it due to the later action movies as they are not similar at all.  I highly recomend this movie to anyone.",1250035200,,1673,4.045731707317073

72019,3,0784011370,"Sylvester Stallone achieved amazing heights during the 80's, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially as a movie character synonymous with the muscled guy who is a pure fighting machine...

In Ted Kotcheff's ""First Blood,"" John Rambo (Stallone) is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who was trained specifically as a killing machine... He has come to a quite little town in Oregon, only to visit one of his platoon buddies... He was told that his friend has died, last summer, of cancer...

Disheartened, Rambo continues to walk the streets of Hope when he is annoyed by the local Sheriff (Brian Dennehy), and booked for vagrancy and resisting arrest...

Beaten, kicked all over, treated like trash, and pushed too far by the other cops in the Sheriff's office, Rambo is taking back to traumatic flashbacks, to the enduring torture in POW camp... Rambo, by that point, fights his way out and wages a one-man war against the police force that escalates out of control... Rambo is seen as a one man army overpowering all the sheriff's deputies and escaping into the surrounding woods...

""First Blood"" communicates the rage, the depression, the frustration and the psychological wounds of one Vietnam soldier that fought for his country and was then hassled by it upon his return...

But what makes Rambo such a dangerous hero is Brian Dennehy being incredibly efficient as the cruel officer who doesn't like the looks of Stallone... Sure he's the abusive sheriff who is the victim of his environment, but he's also arrogant and incessantly underestimating a man who was 'the best, with guns, with knives, with his bare hands...'

72021,5,0784011370,"This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels. It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it. There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well. Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.

Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to. War. Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue. To potentially misquote Rambo :

""I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Let it go...""",1231632000,2,775,4.16
72022,3,0784011370,"Seeing this movie, and expecting something innovative, I was disappointed with what I got.  And while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't something I saw as worth multiple re-releases and being hailed as a classic.

And for these comments, I get bashed and flamed and mocked and insulted for things beyond my control.  As of now and the viewing of this film, I was/am only 20 years old, but apparently I'm not old enough to ""get"" this film, because according to the people who commented on my review, I'm ""still a child"" and given a mantra of ""You just don't get it"".

And this time it was completely different from the ""You just don't get it typical American needing your car chases and gunfights to be entertained"" mantra given for pretentious crappy art films, it was a ""You just don't get it because you're a snobbish little twit for being 20 years old"".  Wow!

And kind of ironically, I end up re-releasing my review, changed a bit by circumstances unrelated to these flamers.

Spending some time thinking about the film and watching ""Rambo"" again and ""First Blood II"", I saw that the film was not a 2/5 but more a 3/5 in my view.  I do that because the character of John Rambo himself is a far more well-rounded character than I gave credit for, and he is a far more amiable and pitiable person than I had originally thought.

The plot in my opinion does not spend enough time on the true ""story"" of the film.  The subtle, ulterior plot that I had not even noticed until some time after the movie, ultimately culminated in ""Rambo"" in 2008; that John Rambo died in Vietnam, and what emerged from the jungle was a broken, lonely man, unable to overcome the fact that, as he so put it in ""Rambo"", war is in his blood.

The movie does spend plenty of time on this, culminating in a climactic monologue by Rambo which is itself worth a viewing of the film, but the more pressing factors of ""Generic Action Flick One-Man-Army-Bad-Ass-Mutha vs Faceless Baddies"" overwhelmed me upon a first viewing.

In ""First Blood"", there wasn't enough affirmation that this story is about John Rambo, either in the form of more flashbacks, or more exposition, and instead muddle it under a frenzy of cold, detached action that may fare well to draw in a larger, entertainment-oriented crowd, but ultimately costs the main theme of the film sufficient build-up for the big final climax which solidifies the movie.

So in short, the movie could have been a classic.  But too much energy was built towards short-term action rather than long-term drama.  Quite frankly, I'm pointing more towards Rambo flashbacks by the campfire, and less Doofballed Douchebags blowing up a cave entrance then getting rowdy as fratboys for nearly effing up the mission (""Bullseye!"" says one particularly stupid-looking idiot with glasses after firing a bazooka into the cave entrance, in a closeup shot and one-liner that really could have been done away with without any harm whatsoever).",1229990400,3,2947,4.739726027397261

The film starts out great but becomes a bit too routine toward the end, which features explosions galore.  Stallone's physical presence lends great authority to his role, and an impassioned monologue in the film's final moments ends the movie on a powerful note.  The gorgeous landscape of the Pacific Northwest provided an excellent setting for the action and was a major reason for my appreciation of this film.",1224892800,,734,5.194915254237288
72024,5,0784011370,"Rambo is a classic action flick, flawlessly simple yet swarming with underlying themes that push it to the edge. The story of a wandering Vietnam vet who walks into a small, quiet town in Washington in search of his last remaining friend never reaches a happy ending. Upon discovering that his last buddy has died of cancer, John Rambo heads into town trying to find a place to eat and collect his thoughts but instead he gets picked up by the sheriff and thrown into jail for vagrancy. When Rambo starts seeing flashbacks from his days as a prisoner of war  that mimic  the abuse caused by deputy Teasle and his buddies all hell breaks loose as he fights his way out of the prison, grabbing his 14 split sawteeth blade, the only trusty friend in his world and dashes out in the wilderness.

From his dog tags the sheriff knows that Rambo is a war hero and a green beret, but still is unable to leave him alone. He drives after him and begins a hunt, one that will change his life in allsorts of ways. Attacked for no reason, Rambo tries to talk his way out but when they draw first blood he fights back the only way he knows how, and that only means one thing - lots of surprise attacks and lots of bodies that starts to vanish, as if sucked into the mountainous terrain by a mysterious force. The more Teasle pushes to find Rambo the worse their personal war gets and in the end the town in hanging by its last legs as John unleashes all the demons in his head unto the smug sheriff and his unfriendly town.

This is such a great movie, I finally got to see it again after many years and it's still amazing. I was in the mood to make it a Rambo day yesterday and see the other three parts but life got in the way. But man, this is so enjoyable and satisfying, it reminds me of the sweet days I spend with my dad watching these movies as a kid and while he lives far away they make me feel close to him. The misty, smoky mountains turned into a trap that Rambo maneuvered skillfully with bare hands except for his trusty knife. I still have a memory of my father making a replica of the Rambo knife, without the compass, so seeing it in the movie made me chuckle, the shape burned into my memory. For those who have never seen it give it a try, it's good even all those years later and has truly stood the test of time.

But it has enough violence for you to like it, for those who like violence.  It's not a total blood body count shooter like Scarface or The Punisher.  You've probably even already seen this.  It's sort of a classic.  So, I really wouldn't consider this movie a top notch shooting movie.  But it's a pretty good action film.  I really liked it when I saw it.

72031,5,0784011370,"(Review by T. Buchanan- Film Freak)

In 1982, Stallone had two huge hits come out in the same year: Rocky III and First Blood. At the time, nobody remembered the 1972 book about a Vietnam Vet named John J. Rambo. After this film was released, however, everybody in the world would know all about Rambo. It would also create the string of sequels that continue until today. Unlike Rocky, Rambo is a tortured soul who loves his country, but is disillusioned and scarred. From the opening scene, Rambo's heart is broken after learning of his war buddy's death by Agent Orange. This is the beginning of Rambo's rampage and it is Sheriff Teasle ( Brian Dennehy, playing the bully as nobody else can) that sets him off. Say what you will about Stallone's acting ability. In this film all you have to do is look at his face to see that America has turned its back on him and spat in his face. We feel for his character immediately. We cheer when he beats the crap out of the redneck deputies. We cheer when he plows through the squad car blockcade. We cry with him at the end when Rambo opens up to Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna) the only friend he has left in the world. Not many of today's so called actors can do that. Look for some notable acting debuts as well from a very young David Caruso ( CSI: Miami and NYPD Blue). Stallone's films have always been the target of the critics who claimed they were ""too violent.""  Actually, this film would probably get a PG rating today. The sequels were much more bloody. The only criticisms I have for this movie would be that Richard Crenna probably graduated from the William Shatner acting school. He's a bit wooden, and the entire movie was shot in Canada, not Washington state. The rest is a very entertaining film from start to finish. Make sure you get the widescreen 'Ultimate' edition. This one has Stallone's commentary and the alternate ending which would have made a sequel impossible. Outstanding direction by Ted Kocheff.",1207612800,,1974,4.573446327683616
72032,4,0784011370,First Blood is action classic that makes you think. Stallone created a new franchise for himself in the form of John Rambo. Brain Denhey makes great bad guy and Richard Crenna as the father figure type is always good.

This in my mind is a solute to the Vietnam Vet that went to do a job and were never recognized for the job they were asked to do, especially by there own country!!
He's trying to get to a friends house he hasn't seen since the war, as he's leaving cause he found out his friend was dead a policemen sticks his nose where is doesn't belong.
Since Rambo didn't follow the policemens direction and leave town after the policemen dropped him off at the edge of town the policmen puts him in jail.
While in jail they try shaving him, he has a flash back to the war like someone is trying to cut him he fights back with the policemen, he kills a couple then gets away from the police station.
I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!",1206057600,,801,4.075949367088608
72035,5,0784011370,"Like the title blurb says, ""First Blood"" is an action/adventure masterpiece of the first order. It's easy to forget this in light of the two cartooney sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985) and ""Rambo III"" (1988).

Most people reading this know the plot: Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mounain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the summer before. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and ends up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army. He easily escapes into the local forests where he takes on both the police and the National Guard in jungle warfare. Before all is said and done he almost levels the entire town!

The picture was filmed in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia. Yes, it's drizzly and dreary with absolutely zero sunshine, but it's incredibly picturesque nevertheless. A wonderful place to commit suicide I'm sure.

Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy and intimidating sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western ""Silverado"" (1985) albeit the character in that film is ten-times WORSE.

Stallone is physically in his prime here, although he's not as bulked-up as in the two sequels. In fact, he's almost skinny in ""First Blood."" His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing ""First Blood"" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape (or get in better shape).

Stallone sort of blows his initial lines talking to the black woman about his war buddy at the beginning, but aside from this he's outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally screams out and lets out all his pent-up rage. This is a potent scene. He screams: ""Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!""

I'm not normally into dvd commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition dvd (the one with the red cover) by writer David Morrell is truly worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the film set many precedents in the action/adventure film genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of films, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.

It doesn't matter how many times you've seen ""First Blood."" The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time. If your a sucker for lost-in-the-woods/survival pictures ""First Blood"" is a must.",1204329600,,2931,4.85
72036,5,0784011370,"Every time I have had to upgrade my video format be it VHS to Laserdisc to DVD to now Blu-ray, First Blood has always been my Litmus test. This is in my top three all time favorite movies and it always seems to be available when a new format emerges. The Blu-ray has the best transfer so far out of all the previous ones and I am very picky when I say this. This is a film that was filmed darkly as far as films go and the Blu-ray version has the best contrast and detail yet. Please check for yourself, you will not be disappointed. The only gripe here is when will we ever see the footage from the TV version make it to the light of day.

72037,5,0784011370,"In 1982 Sylvester Stallone releases yet another fantastic movie with ""First Blood"",the first in the Rambo series.""First Blood"" was inspired by David Morrell's epic novel of the same name. While it doesn't take entirely what is in the book and that many parts if not nearly each of them were written by Stallone himself. It is to notice that Stallone gave Rambo a more human perspective of the character than Morrell did. There have been three sequels that followed but whom all failed to reach the level of the first : ""First Blood Part 2""(1985),""Rambo III""(1988) and the more recent ""Rambo"" in 2008. Decades latter and First Blood is still an amazing movie providing you both action and thrills. Stallone managed to bring two memorable franchises,Rocky And Rambo wich became some of America's most beloved movies.

In First Blood Stallone plays the role of John Rambo a Green Beret vet who went to Vietnam and was trained to kill. Rambo searches for the last of his comrades from the Green Berets days,and finds out he died from cancer a few years ago. He walks to a nearby town and is trown out of the town by Sheriff William Teasle. Rambo comes back and is ""roughed up"" by the cops who without knowing they had made a new powerfull ennnemy. John escapes and the police chases him. He then shows us how much of a killing machine he is by setting up traps and killing. That's when Colonel Samuel Trautman(who was initialy going to be played by Kirk Douglas and at the last minute it all changed)comes in. He claims to be the only one who can stop Rambo as he trained him and obeyed him. It turns out to be a terrific action movie full of suspense and at the same time full of drama and intense moments. Let me tell you if you enjoy movies with any of the mentionned above you are likely to love this movie.

The special features. It is known already that the movie itself is incredible as well as a must see classic. The features from previous releases are gone for the most part,and the commentaries by the ""First Blood"" novel creator David Morrell are not included anymore wich is a shame considering he talked about many things and gave lots of helpfull information. The alternate endings are still there including the ending when Rambo killed himself which was the original ending of the movie before it was changed because of bad reactions to the ending. There are many possibilities for audio and visual with the metascopes and others that let you wtahc the film in different ways. I wonder why they cutted the extras,they did the same for the Rocky remasters. My advice : if you have the older versions don't get these you won't get anything new.its not worth it. If you cans score one of these ""Special Editions"" then you might consider yourself to have gotten a great deal. Those ""Ultimate Editions"" aren't so ultimate after all.

""First Blood"" stands as a classic and a must have. It does not suit everyone be advised so have to know a minimum on the movie before you actually rent and/or buy it. As mentionned above those editions aren't the best and the older editions are much better. Yet this one is easier to find and ainvailable nearly everywhere DVDs are sold which is pretty much the only advantage with these Ultimate editions. You can also save a lot by buying the ""Ultimate Edition"" boxed set of the first three Rambo. Overral,one of Stallone's crowning achievements and best work AND one of my favourite movies of all time. The best Rambo movie out of the four. You can't go wrong by picking this up if you are a fan of action movies and/or Sylvester Stalone,I liked both so this definatly worked for me.

NOTE: A few weeks prior to writting this review the fourth Rambo was released,""Rambo"",in theatres January 25th 2008(I will get to that in another review).",1203897600,,3783,4.6083086053412465

With elements of 'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' this creates an atmospheric movie which is thrilling, entertaining and pretty violent as well.

Stallone doesn't have to do much acting wise, but his action stuff is well done and generally he looks the part and is very believeable as a disgruntled Vietnam Vet. However its the always excellent Brian Dennehy as the local Town Sheriff, who has bitten off more than he can chew, that holds the film together, with another classy performance.

IMO this is the only one of the first three Rambo films worth owning (I haven't seen the latest yet) and it should be in your collection.",1203292800,,781,4.82089552238806

72040,5,0784011370,"Hollywood films have brought us some of the most memorable heroes over the years that have found themselves a place within our collective hearts and minds. Whether these heroes be adapted from books, comic books, video games, or real life, they each have several traits in common in which we all relate; from their capacity for good, to trying their best to do what's right, and of course, no matter the obstacles set before them, always fight for those that cannot fight for themselves. Each of our cinematic heroes always seems to embody the very best in all of us. Among the ranks of cinema's greatest heroes is a character that was born from a novel by writer David Morrell, and at first glance didn't seem destined to be the great action hero he later became over the course of three sequels. The character I am referring to is the other most popular character that Sylvester Stallone embodied outside of boxer Rocky Balboa, none other than John Rambo, the Vietnam veteran and former Green Beret, who wanted nothing more than to find acceptance from the very country that he had fought and bled for when it needed him most. Of course, Rambo never would have become the hero we love if not for the excellent film that started it all, ""First Blood"" from director Ted Kotcheff (""Uncommon Valor"") that introduced audiences to the tortured soul of a man simply looking for a place to belong.

""First Blood"" is the story of Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who is traveling the country trying to find former brothers-in-arms; instead, all he finds is heartache as each and every one of his friends from the war have died, leaving him all alone in a world that seems it would rather forget he and his kind ever existed. As he walks into a small town looking for a bite to eat, the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) deems him to be a disturbance and proceeds to usher him quickly out of town. However, Rambo refuses and is subsequently arrested for vagrancy, but after the local police make the terrible mistake of mistreating their newest prisoner, Rambo feels that his only course of action is to free himself of their custody, and flee to the surrounding woods. As the local police are hunting him, Rambo's splintered mind is taking him back to his time as a Green Beret, and all of his lethal training begins to take over. Realizing the high cost of their mistake, the police turn to a man who knows John Rambo all too well, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who desperately wants to ensure Rambo's safe apprehension, while at the same time averting anymore bloodshed before it's too late. Now, in a strange town, surrounded by people who appear to hate and fear him, Rambo believes he is fighting a new kind of war and he will stop at nothing to survive, and ultimately win.

""First Blood"" is an engaging look at the trauma many veterans face upon returning home and finding that the reception isn't quite what they expect it to be. The film examines not only the ramifications of war on those who proudly serve their country in times of need, but also what could happen when a man is pushed too far and what he may be willing to do to protect himself. It is surprising that the serious topic of how we as a country have treated our veterans, namely those of the Vietnam War, is front and center in this action-packed film. It is this higher quality storytelling that elevates ""First Blood"" into becoming much more than your average action movie.

The superior quality of the story for the film came from author David Morrell, who wrote the original novel the film was based upon, it was then adapted into a screenplay by writers Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Sylvester Stallone. Though I've read that the film differs in numerous places from the book, if not for that initial novel this film may not have had the same level of depth, social commentary, and realism that made ""First Blood"" so much better than other action movies of its time. Assisting in the quality of the film, was the solid, no frills direction from director Ted Kotcheff, who by choosing to film on location imbued the film with a gritty, natural feeling in tone that could not have been captured as easily on a back lot of some studio in Hollywood.

The acting from Sylvester Stallone was some of the best he has ever done in any of his films. We all knew from his 'Rocky' series of films that he could handle the action scenes and even the dramatic ones, but it was the pure emotion he brought to the character that was so surprising, especially in that riveting final scene in the police station. Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy were superb in their supporting roles as Colonel Trautman and Sheriff Teasle. Crenna created a pseudo-father figure for Rambo with Trautman, and provided audiences, along with the characters in the movie, the interesting insights into the possible mindset of Rambo, and also just what exactly he is capable of. As a credit to his talent, Crenna's character of Trautman not only became one of his most popular characters throughout his entire career, but his character's brief moments of exposition may have been the key point in the film in which Rambo went from being just a misunderstood war veteran, to one of Hollywood's iconic heroes. Brian Dennehy was perfect as the seemingly good natured Sheriff when we first meet him, to becoming the slimy villain, who along with the rest of his police force, embodied the viewpoint of the numerous protestors to the Vietnam War and its veterans, and all others who have judged rather than respect our veterans throughout the history of our country.

""First Blood"" is an extremely well made survival-themed adventure film that is full of intensity, drama, and exhilarating action sequences that will have you riveted until the film's final moments. A must-see for all action movie fans and is an exciting opening chapter to one of Hollywood's most action-packed franchises. As a tribute to just how enduring the character of Rambo is within Hollywood, 2008 saw the return of the hero in the appropriately titled ""Rambo"", the fourth film in the franchise, and the first 'Rambo' film in 20 years.

""First Blood"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.",1203120000,,6264,4.72644098810613
72041,5,0784011370,"Contemporary mythology, as Joseph Campbell once said, is how mankind is remembered both culturally and anthropologically. It is what lasts...

With that in mind, amongst the memorable archetypes of the last 50 years or so comes John Rambo. As easily misunderstood by critics as he is by everyone in his filmic universe, he is sometimes written off as a 'killing machine'. This misses the point. John Rambo is really every man who was called by his people to go to war for them. It's just played on a broad cinematic canvas.

War is hell, as anyone who has ever experienced it can tell you. And the absolute impossibility of conveying those experiences with anyone outside the realm has created, particularly in our media savvy society, a number of disaffected and alienated young men. It is to this that Sylvester Stallone's nicely nuanced performance speaks.

Beautifully shot in the Pacific Northwest, Stallone's Rambo is a drifter
ostensibly in search of a Vietnam buddy whom he finds has died from toxic Agent Orange poisoning. What he is really searching for is is soul- and his humanity. The reception he is given by the town Sheriff (played beautifully by Brian Denehy) is an allegory for how we, as a society, have used and then turned our back on these young men. Ridiculed, humiliated, and jailed, Rambo takes war against the new enemy- those
who are tormenting him.

The plot thickens nicely when Colonel Sam Trautman (the hugely underrated
Richard Crenna) shows to 'take charge' of the situation. Seems he trained
Rambo in the Special Forces and commanded him in Vietnam. What he really
is is the estranged father figure that Rambo desperately wants approval
from. This works extremely well on a deeper psychological level than one might expect from a 'B' actioner.

This is an important film. Important for it's cultural significance, for John Rambo is truly a great Ameican icon in the clasic sense. Important too, is it's impact on filmaking- his characterization has been copied endlessly by the likes of Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris, all of which lack the subtext that Stallone brought.

I do suggest, however, that one skips the next two installments in the series (they're ok, but just really potboilers) and instead see his superb followup out in theaters now. Called simply 'Rambo', it serves well as a coda for the character.

Forget the critics on this one, folks, and particularly the excellent Blu-Ray transfer will have you more involved than ever before. This movie satnds the test of time.

This film is a revenge-fest for anyone wanting a healthy way to release pent-up agression against typical Republican idiots and you'll save big money by skipping those tawdry S&M home scenes that are just a bore compared.  Besides, nobody has room for all the accoutrement these days.

Johnnie Rambo is just minding his business when a typical small-town, power hungry cop decides he needs to control someone (reminds me of a lot of my past bosses) and gives him a really hard time.  Welllll, let me tell you, Rambo gets 'em all back and then some.

Instead of just a run-of-the-mill bad guy, Sheriff Teasle finds himself in a situation where he is in over his head, and at a complete loss as to how to handle it. Initially he is just trying to protect his small town from what he considers a bad element, things get out of his control quickly, and he is stuck trying to mop things up.

Certainly the series turns into a mindless bullet-fest with the later incarnations (not that there's anything wrong with that), but this first movie is much more than just a mindless action flick.

I liked the way this flick was directed, although my feeling is Stallone's monologue at the end might have been handled more convincingly by a better actor...but what can you do? I'm a Nam vet and the words did ring true.

My feeling is Stallone as Rambo is best when he sticks to not saying much at all. That's the character, that's the way I envisioned him from reading the novel.

Also: Stallone's narration (if we're talking about the same edition) is very good. Sly has a knack for this sort of thing.

Lastly, if this were a truly ""honest"" flick, the sherrif would have been done away with for what he had put rambo through, and so would have the colonel--for attempting to con him into surrendering... Anyway, that's not the flick we were given...and the flick we were given is not too bad at all.

72062,5,0784011370,"Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) scored gold when, in 1982, he accepted the role of Medal of Honor awarded Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo who upon arriving back home is greeted with the disgust and disrespect of his own people in the classic motion picture First Blood.

It's not until Rambo passes through a small town in the heart of America and gets harrassed by the town's sherrif Teasle, played by Brian Dennehy, that he finally snaps. Rambo escapes the clutches of the town's law enforcement officers into the nearby forested mountains where he feels right at home considering that he was a green beret. The officers are in for a surprising all out war as Rambo takes them down one at a time and singlehandedly brings havoc to their tiny city that they call home. The only man who can possibly bring him in is his former trainer, Colonel Trautman, played brilliantly by the late Richard Crenna (the role was originally offered to Kirk Douglas but he eventually turned it down).

First Blood is an extraordinary film that reveals how mistreated the veterans of the Vietnam war were. The film also reveals Stallone's action movie star abilities, something he would later be typecast with, and in addition to the Rocky role, the film gave Stallone his second most popular onscreen character as Rambo.

First Blood also began a series of Rambo movies: 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part 2, and 1987's Rambo 3, but neither sequel came close to the brilliance of the original.

This time, in contrast to his negative experience with F.I.S.T.

Later on, Stallone would transform other 1970s anti-heroes into more sympathetic, triumphant men: writer-director Stallone turned disco maniac Tony Manero of Saturday Night Fever (1977) into a Broadway star with Rambo physique in the Rocky-esque sequel Staying Alive (1983).

72066,5,0784011370,"First Blood is an outstanding movie. It is about a vietnam veteran green beret named John Rambo who is played by Sylvester Stallone. After recurring nightmares and post-traumatic stress from war memories as a prisoner of war in vietnam, Rambo comes back to the states into the pacific northwest in search of a new life. He tries to contact an old war buddy only to find out that his friend has died of cancer. After a walk into town, Rambo is greeted by Sheriff Will Teasle who offers to give Rambo a lift out of town on the promise that he does not return. Rambo asks for where he can get a bite to eat, and the sheriff says that he can find a diner about 30 miles up the highway.

Rambo asks Teasle, ""Why are you pushing me? I haven't done anything to you."" Teasle says, ""We don't want guys like you in this town. First thing you know, we got a bunch of guys like you in this town. That's why."" After being driven to Teasles drop off point, Rambo decides to challenge him and starts walking back into town. Teasle arrests Rambo and charges him with vagrancy, resisting arrest, and carrying a concealed weapon. After some torturous experiences in the jail cell (only meant to clean him up), Rambo has a major flashback to the Vietnam war and goes berzerk.

He busts out of the joint, tears a guy off of his dirtbike and heads up into the mountains ensuing a huge chase involving the sheriff's posse, a helicopter, search dogs, and the national guard. There are some very interesting twists and turns to the plots as you never know what will happen from one minute to the next. The scene where he jumps off the cliff into some trees, cuts open an arm on a branch, and stitches his arm up is one of the best scenes and most memorable... Ouch!

The climactic scene is great because in the end, Rambo breaks down and becomes an innocent fragile child explaining how he was mistreated by citizens as he returned to the states, having his friend get blown to bits in front of him in Saigon, all of the bad things that happened to him. He should have gotten an oscar for his performance in that scene because his breakdown was pretty heroic and gutsy. Overall, a very good movie with regard to how a lot of vets feel after they return from a war and dealing with psychological issues because of...

72067,5,0784011370,"John Rambo was a man on the edge. He had fought courageously for his country, he even was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery and valor. He was also an exceedingly dangerous man, a killing machine, a man haunted by memories of Viet Nam. An Army Ranger, a member of a special unit that worked solitary, behind enemy lines in South Viet Nam, living off the land, killing, maiming and dispiriting the enemy. He was a prisoner, who was tortured mercilessly, until his escape, when he was finally sent home, not to cheers and parades but a chorus of dissenters spewing venom and saliva.

If that wasn't bad enough, he had been rousted and ran out of town by sheriffs and chiefs of police throughout the Northwest before he got to this the small mountain town of Hope, where there came an inevitable clash of wills with the local Chief of Police, Wilfred Teasle (Brian Dennehy).

John Rambo is just passing through and decides to get a hamburger and a coke but Chief Teasle has other ideas. He doesn't want any riffraff in his town so he picks up Rambo and drives him to the edge of town, He wasn't particularly nasty about it, in fact he tried to be pleasant, determined but pleasant, but he wasn't so pleasant later when he found the kid in the local diner. He told the waitress to put the kid's order in a bag and hustled him back out of town. By now Teasle was very annoyed, so he went and parked on a side street and kept watch to make sure the kid did not walk back into town.

For his part the kid (Rambo) had reached his limit. If someone was going to push him, he was going to push back. He was determined to go back and confront the Chief and make him back down but of course Teasle had other ideas. He arrested the kid, took him to jail, hosed him down and started to give him a haircut and a shave.

As mentioned, Rambo was an escaped POW. He was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese and was tortured relentlessly before escaping, so when the deputies tried to shave him with a straight razor, he flipped out and grabbed the razor and slashed a deputy that reached for his gun.

Thus began an odyssey of death and mayhem in the nearby mountains and eventually destroyed a good part of Hope.

Conclusion

To start with, I must tell you that First Blood is one of my favorite movies, so naturally I think everything was top drawer. The acting, the directing, the story, the editing, the cinematography, everything was excellent, especially Stallone who shinned with his less is more style of acting, reminiscent of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne.

The story came from a debut novel of the same name by David Morrell, who after such an auspicious start has penned many more novels. I read the novel as well and as violent as the film is the book is much more violent. The novel was set in the town of Madison, Kentucky, instead of Hope. By the way the town that the movie was shot in was indeed Hope, but it was in British Columbia, Canada not Washington or Oregon.

Overall, I find First Blood, to be an immensely entertaining movie and one full of morals. You may not be aware of these morals while you are watching the movie but they are more obvious upon examination. It would be good if we could take these morals with us from this movie and adopt them. Things like; you cannot judge a book by it's cover, things are not always as they seem, never prejudge your fellow man, live and let live, authority is not an excuse for misconduct and so forth.

First Blood was the first and in my opinion the best of the Rambo trilogy, with the second being very good as well. If you haven't seen either of these great movies, you're in for a treat. Assuming you like action movies that is. Final Rating 5 Stars.",1126051200,5,4045,4.456639566395664
72068,3,0784011370,"No one is likely to give Mr Stallone a Best Actor Oscar .
However, one has to give him credit as a writer and as a person who knows what his audience wants from him in playing certain character types - after all, he's acting to be successful .

The film does make other valid points about returning war veterans, but its main focus is the action angle .

Sly plays off Brian Dennehy (the town policeman) very well and the tension begins to build up early in the piece as a result .

If you are looking for an action film that is not for the kids , then you could do worse than this .
Don't look any deeper into it than you should and you may find you enjoy it .
A film for the guys mainly - with more drama than bloodshed.

Update as of Jan 2010: I have bought the American Blu Ray edition and would like to advise that it is region free. If you are elsewhere in the world, this disc is worth picking up due to the picture quality and the worthwhile supplements on it - it is very good value.

Brian Dennehy is great as the town sheriff who has a real mean streek to him. Richard Crenna is great as the colonel who trained Rambo who must help him before its too late. The screenplay cowritten by Stallone has some great moments including the radio conversation between Rambo and Trautman (Crenna). Also has a really documentary on making of the film.

72072,4,0784011370,"The most important thing to keep in mind when watching ""First Blood"" is not that this 1982 film was Slyvester Stallone's second most successful series after the Rocky films, but that at that point in pop culture history the Vietnam vet had essentially replaced the Nazi as the default villain in a lot of movies and television shows. The idea was that you took somebody with military training and set them off because (a) they did drugs in Nam, (b) were exposed to Agent Orange, (c) went crazy under the pressure, (d) were rejected by their government and the American people when they got home, or (e) any combination of the above. In that light, ""First Blood"" was one of the few films to present a Vietnam vet as a hero. John Rambo was moody and mentally unstable, in a trained killing machine sort of way, but he had a sense of honor and only struck back when pushed too far.

The rule of thumb is that a movie succeeds more on the villain than the hero, and that holds true in this case, with Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, who does not take a liking to a the moody, shaggy haired, Rambo when he wanders through town. Teasle take Rambo into custody and tries to show him who is boss, but has a deputy sergeant (Jack Starrett) who takes things to far. Rambo snaps, easily escapes from the police station, and the massive manhunt hunt is on. The only problem is that Teasle and all of his men are no match for an unarmed Rambo, who quickly finds a way to arm himself. Teasle has some understanding of how his men are culpable in what is going on, but stubbornly insists that the rule of law should still apply, even when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives right behind the National Guard to explain how big of a mistake the locals have made.

The main problem with this film is that there were sequels, which buried the strengths of the original under big budget gloss (a charge that can be leveled against the Rocky series as well). Beyond that the main complain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action. As such, the politics become an excuse for the violence, which is one of those things that would be ironic on so many levels. Then, at the end, when the movie becomes political again, it seems rather uncomfortably forced and Rambo's articulation of the very real plight of a lot of Vietnam vets becomes exceedingly forced (actually, at the end of this film, after being moody and silent for most of the film, Rambo talks a LOT). The best of the action sequences is when Teasle and his cops (including a relatively young David Caruso), try to track down Rambo in the woods, mainly because it relies more on stealth and intelligence than big guns and bigger explosions. Against a Green Beret these boys have no chance and when Rambo offers Teasle one last chance to let it go, and when the Sheriff refuses, all of our sympathies go to Rambo.

The message of ""First Blood"" might be forced, but it is hard to turn in a stern indictment of the film on that basis given what was happening with Vietnam vets in Hollywood. Even in this heavy-handed effort you have to admit there was an attempt at a noble motive.  ""First Blood"" changed the action genre as one of the first movies to feature a brief set-up and then pretty much non-stop action for the rest of the film. Originally, Rambo was killed at the end, but audiences were upset by that so the ending was changed and Stallone was able to milk two sequels out of the character.",1111276800,,3572,4.457186544342508
72073,4,0784011370,"This film seen under the serene gaze of more than twenty years is the expected reaction of so many frustrations, disillusions born under the bad sign of Vietnam. In those ages  the state of abandon and apathy in all the country had almost a quarter of century. From the Kennedy affair till the last eighties a chain of successive scandals,  politic corruption and internal affairs of any issue literally invaded every inch of ink of the principal headlines of the written press and other mediums.

In this state of things, the depressed spirit was analyzed by the merchandisers and Rocky was the first punch to raise the self stem of the mass media. Songs as Born in the USA, for instance, made the same role. Then Rambo was born as a mythological figure. A hero born precisely from the ashes who lived the hell and become  a machine human war. And the rest is story. The film obviously sympathizes with John Rambo as the peaceful man who simply wants to forget his job and remake a new life, but the ancestral codes and the old fashioned mind of the law bureaucracy will raise the hidden demons.

Despite the picture has aged, it's a fundamental piece in those turbulent ages and it worked out perfectly as cathartic device. Excellent action sequences.",1110585600,2,1253,4.677272727272728

In the latter two movies, Rambo sort of became a super hero. There's nothing wrong with that, but in the first movie he was more of a regular person who was dealing with extreme circumstances. I think that's one of the main reasons I prefer this one over the sequels.

Stallone is often underrated as an actor. He gives a great performance in this movie. Also very good are Brian Dennehey and Richard Crenna.

Even though First Blood is now over twenty years old, it still holds up very well and is definitely worth watching.",1110067200,,655,4.487394957983193
72075,4,0784011370,"First Blood is a straight-forward, well-written action flick that keeps the audiences attention and ends on an emotional note that serves to expose the plight of our veterans of vietnam.  John Rambo's treatment by the local sheriff is not unlike that which some of our less fortunate citizens experience when law enforcement gets carried away.  For an action film, First Blood didn't stray too far away from reality like many of today's hyper-violent films do.  For that reason, the film succeeded and has a loyal fanclub.  If there's anyone left who hasn't seen First Blood, I think you'll be glad you did.

A spotlight reviewer stated she didn't like Stallone's acting because his voice is annoying and his mouth is squinted to one side, like a stroke victim.  Well, you nearly guessed it.  For the record, Stallone had a complicated birth that left one side of his face paralyzed, hence his speech impediment and asymetrical facial features.  The guy is a lot smarter than he sounds.  I applaud him for overcoming what in today's acting world would be a career-limiting featural flaw.

Stallone has had his share of flops (Judge Dread, etc) but he can act with the best of them when the film is well written and directed.  He's also a talented writer, as evidenced by his writing credit for Rocky.

I can't say enough good things about Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Wil Teasle.  He really nailed the part.  I especially liked his squaring off with Colonel Samuel Trautman.  Dennehy brings a wealth of acting ability to any film he's in.  If Stallone is the brick, Dennehy is the mortar in First Blood.  Well done.",1105660800,3,1611,4.778985507246377

After the success of ""Rocky III"", in the Summer of 1982, Sylvester Stallone's next film, titled ""First Blood"", would introduce the movie going audience with his second trademark character, a Vietnam Veteran turned drifter who pushes back after being pushed too far.

""First Blood"" opens with, Vietnam Vet., John Rambo searching for Delmar Barry, a friend of his that served with Rambo in the Special Forces. Rambo finds where Barry was staying and is shocked to find out that his friend died from cancer, contracted from Agent Orange.

Shocked at the loss of his friend, alone, & alienated, Rambo walks the cold highway into the local town of ""Hope"" to get food & rest. But, not if the local Sheriff, Will Teasle, has his say. Spotting Rambo on the entrance road into town, Teasle stops his cruiser and insists on giving Rambo a ride... to the otherside of town, with the next town being Portland, 30 miles away. Teasle informs Rambo that ""his kind"" isn't welcome in town & Teasle's job is to keep it that way.

Rambo, tired of this King S*it Cop, decides to walk back into town & promptly arrested for vagrancy & resisting arrest. After more brutality by Teasle's second in command & fellow officers, Rambo has had enough. Taking matters into his own hands, Rambo breaks out of the Sheriff's Station & proceeds to lead a one man war against the local law enforcement & anything that stands in his way.

A nice surprise comes over the teletype as Teasle and his men are informed that Rambo served in the Special Forces, Green Beret & has been decorated more times than Teasle's artificial Christmas Tree.
""Green Berets, their real bada*ses.""

Teasle leads his men into the mountains to hunt & capture Rambo. But, to Teasle's horror, Rambo takes out each officer, including Teasle.

It seems that no man, no law, & no war can stop Rambo, but the tide may turn with the arrival of Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's former CO in the war, to talk him down & bring him in.
""GOD didn't make Rambo. I did.""

Filmed on location in British Columbia, & Vancouver through November 1981 to January 1982, the production of ""First Blood"" was taxing to say the least, especially for star Sylvester Stallone.

Stallone wore a tank top throughout much of the film, with the weather being ten to fifteen below zero. The water for the brief shot of Rambo hiding from the National Guard was 39 degrees farenheit (thats coldass water to hide in).

The most valuable prop from the film wasn't the Rambo knife used in the film, but, the dirty piece of tarp that Rambo finds in the junkyard and turns into a makeshift poncho. The scene was filmed in one take with Stallone improvising, taking the tarp slashing a hole through the middle of it with his survival knife, putting it ove rhis head, and tying it off with a piece of rope. Direstor, Ted Kotcheff liked the scene so much he kept the scene, but, when the production found out that was the only tarp in the yard, it was up to the propwrangler to keep an eye on the poncho night and day. After the film wrapped Stallone had the tarp framed & resides in his personal collection to this day.

Kirk Douglas was originaly going to star in ""First Blood"" as Colonel Trautman (there is even conceptual poster art produced, with Stallone & Douglas featured promenantly). But, with a sudden change to the ending of the film, Douglas renigged on the role even after the writers considered his demands. Three days before the film's startdate Richard Crenna signed on & I can't imagine anyone else in the role.

This special edition to ""First Blood"" is, so far, the definitive version to own (the new ""Ultimate"" edition doesn't come close). Features include a widescreen transfer, Dolby Digital & DTS 5.1 Surround, and outstanding audio commentary by creator & author David Morrell. Also, featured is a behind the scenes look back at the making of the film & trailers.",1102896000,6,4648,4.591073582629674
72077,3,0784011370,"I notoriously hate re-reviewing films. I've reviewed them once, I forget about the reviews. I also notoriously hate re-watching movies that I don't particularly want to watch again. Yes, everyone gets it into their heads once in a while that they simply have to re-watch a movie, but for me, I have to be really in the mood. And sometimes it can be MORE than five years, before I feel the need/urge/whatever to watch a movie again.

I have a confession to make - the first film I ever saw Mr Stallone in was Demolition Man (I'll have a DVD with the cut full frontal scene please). Hated him in it. I only watched it for Sandra Bullock, and that's because she is one of my favourite actresses. Back then, when I first saw it (taped off the TV don't you know), I didn't like Sly at all. I also didn't like this when I first saw it.

But recently, I've been watching more Sly movies (Rocky's etc), and I have another confession to make - I think I've got a little crush on him. He's old enough to be my dad, but I think it's something to do with the eyes.

First Blood is about a Vietnam veteran called John Rambo. He's what is called a 'drifter' - not a word I particularly like. He's still severely mentally affected after the war, and has numerous flashbacks (I had a blonde moment, and said the flashbacks were to the 'first' movie - duh!) During his wandering, after finding one of his friends in the war was killed by cancer, he comes across a small town, and met by the very unfriendly sheriff, who takes an instant dislike to Rambo. (Good looking, tall, dark eyes, looking very trim in some scenes - yeah, I can see how you would take an instant dislike to him.) The sheriff drops him off outside the town, but Rambo defiantly walks back into the town, kicking off a chain reaction of events.

There's one scene that stands out in First Blood for me - the scene in the police station where Rambo is getting finger printed. I find it absolutely hilarious! He tries to wipe the ink off his fingers with a paper towel, but it gets snatched off him! It's the look on his face, a simple expression but enough to make me giggle anyway! And he still picks up another!

First Blood is actually based on a book, which I didn't expect, and there are quite a few differences between it and the film. The film has a reputation for being really violent, but I found the Rocky movies to be more violent in that sense. However, the total body count of the movie is four; the cop who falls out of the helicopter and the three officers in the cop car who crash into a parked car. Overly violent? Not as much as some movies.

I'd say to anyone who hated First Blood/Mr Stallone on first viewing, watch it again. Give him a chance. I wouldn't say that for anybody *cough*. It's a good action movie, and Sly acts his sad eyes out. Definitely better (in my opinion) on second viewing.",1102377600,,2868,4.311688311688312
72078,4,0784011370,"When Sylvester Stallone's name comes up it's usually with derision.  He's generally dismissed as an actor and the over-inflated killing machine of ""Rambo"" is brought up.  People tend to forget that at the time ""First Blood"" came out Stallone had carved himself a nice little career as an actor.  He had the success of the first ""Rocky"" film under his belt, and ""F.I.S.T."" and ""Nighthawks"" were pretty good films.  ""First Blood"", despite the body count does have a cogent message.  John Rambo is a returning Vietnam vet who is being harrassed by the local police force in a Pacific Northwest town.  They subject him to all sorts of degradation before he finally snaps.  What the constabulary do not realize is that Rambo is no mere vagrant, that he was trained by the Marine Special Forces and that the rules of engagement are ingrained in him whether it be the bush in Vietnam or back on the homefront.  Stallone, aside from his skills as an action star, gives a sympathetic portrayal here.  The acting is generally good.  Brian Dennehy gives dimension as the sheriff that could have been one-note.  A young David Caruso appears as a deputy.  Richard Crenna's role as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's commanding officer, is a little one-dimensional.

72080,4,0784011370,"""You trained me. You made me. You kill me."" - Rambo goes off the deep-end in the original ending to ""First Blood""

I will always give four stars to ""First Blood"" (hence, the 4 star rating above), but with this third DVD release of the film from ""Lions Gate Home Video"", die-hard fans should only pick this up for the so called legendary & ""lost"" original ending (it didn't show up on the ""Special Edition"" because the footage couldn't be located in time)& thats after if you can't find the footage to download from the internet or some other source.

I got an advanced copy of ""First Blood"" Ultimate Edition this week (the streetdate is 11/23/04), & was psyched to see what was in store on this DVD. But, after watching all the special features I couldn't help but feel like I had opened a huge Christmas Gift & finding only a flaming paper bag of dog crap to put out.

The film itself is identical to the ""S.E."" version with ""First Blood"" in the widescreen format with 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 surround. The audio commentary by Sylvester Stallone is new & informative (where the hell was he for the ""Special Edition"" ?!?).

The deleted scenes are what fans have always been clamoring for & the original ending hasn't been shown to audiences since the film's preview screenings in mid '82. The original ending was a bit weird to watch & a bit off with the film itself. Here is a marine who went through 2 tours of Vietnam, a P.O.W., and just beat the crap out of ""Jerkwater, USA"" only to commit suicide at the unwilling hands of his Colonel. Huh?! Decades ago I read the David Morrell novel of the same name and I always thought, & I could be mistaken, that Rambo gave Trautman an ultimatum - kill or be killed. If Trautman didn't kill Rambo first, than Rambo would attack Trautman, leaving the Colonel with the only alternative but to kill Rambo.

The other deleted scene has to do with a flashback sequence Rambo has while eating his boar meat in the cave. the scene is simple enough, in Saigon, Rambo picks up an Asian hooker & makes love to her (Suzee Pai, who was Miao Yin, the girl with the green eyes, in the Kurt Russell film ""Big Trouble In Little China"", plays the hooker). The scene was cut becuase it slowed the movie down to a crawl and killed the pacing of the film (at the end of this scene Stallone is shown crying and I couldn't help but wonder if his character is having a breakdown or if Stallone is crying because he just watched one of the most embarassing moments of his career).

The last deleted scene is a blooper take of the original ending, with Rambo telling Trautman to shoot him & after a long pause, with the take botched, Rambo says, ""Thanks a million."", with Trautman shrugging his shoulders & replying, ""O.K."" (its worth the chuckle).

As for the rest of the DVD, I wasn't impressed at all. Its a barebones affair with no trailers, or documentaries at all (""Special Edition"", anyone?). The ""Survival Mode"" feature sucks & was, actually, quite annoying. The briefing & tracking location features were lame and the other survival features could have been used as a trivia track that could run at the bottom of the screen while watching the film. The menus aren't interactive and look as if they were put together rather quickly. Pre-schoolers could have done a better job.

Ultimately the decision on whether to own this is up to you, the viewer.

Is this the final DVD release of ""First Blood""?

Just remember what Rambo said near the end of the film.

72083,5,0784011370,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time on July 4, 1984. I know back then I was into long hair, and alot of 60's and 70's music. Didn't do acid, or any drugs as I was 16, and grew up in a police officer's house. I always knew police brutality existed, but after this movie I suddenly realized that men in short hair aren't always the good guys. I mean after all there are no pictures of the devil with long hair, or at least from what I've seen. I know watching this movie I've developed a intense prejudice of hick folks, and country bumpkins, and the such as I feel that they are self-righteous, and know it alls, and that they are God. I know that the only other people in movies that rubbed me the wrong way were Sherrif Buford T. Justice from ""Smokey and the Bandit"", and the corrupt sherrif who smacked around his deputy in the movie ""Tank"". However, don't get me wrong the same way that Sherrif Teasle, and crew are accountable so is Rambo. Rambo still is accountable for murdering an officer of the law even though it was self-defense. He'd have to go to court, and prove it as such. The Veitnam war no doubt has ruffled alot of feathers, and in my opinion while I understand why some ran away to Canada I also understand why some went there. I can only imagine what the soldiers went through there as I was only a baby when this was all going on. Like all veterans of all the wars the Veitnam Veterans should've been given dignity, and respect all along for fighting to keep our freedom. Mind you I'd have to start digging for the whole 30 year war over there, and why it impacted us so much. The same way I feel that the laws back here are to be respected, and a police officer should be given the same dignity, and respect as that of a soldier who went overseas to fight. I know one phrase was powerful when Teasle said ""That if a prisoner is mistreated, by a deputy he brings it to him, and then Teasle(him) goes to the deputy, and that's how the law works"", but what happens when the head vigilanty is your Sherrif? Overall this movie should've made America reflect on how we reacted, and treated these brave soldiers when they returned from Veitnam, and come to grips with our actions, and our attitudes. However, America missed the boat by glorifying Rambo for all the wrong reasons, and diffused the character, and the message. They made Rambo a gun toting vigilanty, and that was America's new superhero. Rambo wanted no war. He wanted to visit his friend, and became heartbroken when he found out his friend was dead. All Rambo wanted was a hot meal, and a chance to grieve before moving on; who knows Rambo may had found peace for once in Holidayland, but now it's citizens will never know as Prejudice was standing at the door when Rambo knocked. To me America is still acting that way, and it's time to forgive, and reconcile, and move on.",1088726400,6,2868,4.3626168224299064

72085,3,0784011370,"The original Theatrical Aspect Ratio for First Blood was anamorphic widescreen - 2.35:1 (cinemascope). On its 35mm cinema film neg & stock, it is compressed horizontally in a 2:1 ratio. This interprets that on the film, it will roughly be 1.17:1 and on screen, it will magnify and stretch to its intended 2.35:1 format.
What deterred me from buying this particular DVD is that on its ""Technical Information"" page, it has listed this DVD's aspect ratio for Widescreen as - 1.85:1 (which is generally non-anamorphic and flat) suggesting that it has been incorrectly set to - ""Letterbox"" (used to cover production mechanics such as lens' barn doors, sound booms, etc.). If this is the case, certain part of its image that was originally viewed in the cinemas would now be blocked out. That's almost as bad as the 1.33:1 pan & scan. Maybe it's an info error?
I like to watch movies in the format it was intended to be seen by the filmmakers. Also, I can never understand why anyone would want to own an inferior full-screen/pan & scan format. It's like watching half a movie.
On this DVD release, it seems the studios have provided both widescreen & full-screen. I assume this equates to having both sides of the disc being used. It would have been better served to have an attractive picture on one side to reduce accidental handling faults such as dirt or finger prints on the read-areas of the disc. Of course, the flip side should be the majority's choice - Widescreen (when available).
An option for English subtitles would have been great too. When actors tend to mumble, it is handy to be able to rewind to a particular scene and turn on the subtitles to find out what the character in the script was supposed to have said.",1078790400,4,1726,4.662295081967213
72086,4,0784011370,"The most important thing to keep in mind when watching ""First Blood"" is not that this 1982 film was Slyvester Stallone's second most successful series after the Rocky films, but that at that point in pop culture history the Vietnam vet had essentially replaced the Nazi as the default villain in a lot of movies and television shows.  The idea was that you took somebody with military training and set them off because (a) they did drugs in Nam, (b) were exposed to Agent Orange, (c) went crazy under the pressure, (d) were rejected by their government and the American people when they got home, or (e) any combination of the above.  In that light, ""First Blood"" was one of the few films to present a Vietnam vet as a hero.  John Rambo was moody and mentally unstable, in a trained killing machine sort of way, but he had a sense of honor and only struck back when pushed too far.
The rule of thumb is that a movie succeeds more on the villain than the hero, and that holds true in this case, with Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, who does not take a liking to a the moody, shaggy haired, Rambo when he wanders through town.  Teasle take Rambo into custody and tries to show him who is boss, but has a deputy sergeant (Jack Starrett) who takes things to far.  Rambo snaps, easily escapes from the police station, and the massive manhunt hunt is on.  The only problem is that Teasle and all of his men are no match for an unarmed Rambo, who quickly finds a way to arm himself.  Teasle has some understanding of how his men are culpable in what is going on, but stubbornly insists that the rule of law should still apply, even when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives right behind the National Guard to explain how big of a mistake the locals have made.
The main problem with this film is that there were sequels, which buried the strengths of the original under big budget gloss (a charge that can be leveled against the Rocky series as well).  Beyond that the main complain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action.  As such, the politics become an excuse for the violence, which is one of those things that would be ironic on so many levels.  Then, at the end, when the movie becomes political again, it seems rather uncomfortably forced and Rambo's articulation of the very real plight of a lot of Vietnam vets becomes exceedingly forced (actually, at the end of this film, after being moody and silent for most of the film, Rambo talks a LOT).  The best of the action sequences is when Teasle and his cops (including a relatively young David Caruso), try to track down Rambo in the woods, mainly because it relies more on stealth and intelligence than big guns and bigger explosions.  Against a Green Beret these boys have no chance and when Rambo offers Teasle one last chance to let it go, and when the Sheriff refuses, all of our sympathies go to Rambo.
The message of ""First Blood"" might be forced, but it is hard to turn in a stern indictment of the film on that basis given what was happening with Vietnam vets in Hollywood.  Even in this heavy-handed effort you have to admit there was an attempt at a noble motive.  Special mention should be made of the audio commentary on the DVD version by David Morell, who wrote the novel on which the film was based.  Morell is an interesting choice simply because he was not really involved in the production of the film, but this has some interesting payoffs, such as the argument that ""First Blood"" changed the action genre as one of the first movies to feature a brief set-up and then pretty much non-stop action for the rest of the film.  There are some tidbits about the film (Kirk Douglas was originally cast as Colonel Trautman) and how the ending was changed when audiences were upset that Rambo was killed.",1071532800,11,3903,4.491525423728813
72087,4,0784011370,"""First Blood"" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time.  I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama.  Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars).  Stallone actually does some acting in this film.  His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic.  There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable.  Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy.  He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop.
My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels.  Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion.  If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love ""First Blood.""",1071187200,4,1101,4.492462311557789
72088,4,0784011370,"In ""First Blood"" Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo a wandering ex-Green Beret looking for a former Vietnam buddy in a small hostile town.  Rambo is unjustly harassed and arrested by over zealous Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy).  When Rambo is pushed to the limit he strikes back and single handedly beats up several officers in route to an escape into the surrounding hills.
Now that Rambo is back in his element things get interesting as a member of Teasle's posse unwittingly draws ""First Blood"" (hence the title) unleashing the wrath that is Rambo!  The subsequent hoopla and bombast that accompanied the remaining two installments to the series really overshadow the quality of ""First Blood.""  Stallone is at his monosyllabic best with a screenplay that keeps the dialogue down and revs the action up. Veteran action director Ted Kotcheff expertly handles the key set piece of the film that shows Rambo deftly ambushing several unsuspecting victims with such precision that none of them is fatally wounded.  Finally Rambo comes face to face with his accuser Sheriff Teasle to issue an ultimatum that actually does more to up the stakes rather then cool the situation down.  Rambo's former commanding officer Trautmen (Richard Crenna) is brought in for advice but instead issues his own declaration when he tells Sheriff Teasle that if he continues to pursue Rambo he better have a lot of body bags.
""First Blood"" is really a study in wills and the stubbornness not to know when to back down.  Sheriff Teasle is not able to admit that he is over matched and Rambo uses the injustice he has suffered both in the small town and in Vietnam as a reason to let his fury rage on an unsuspecting populace.  Recent films like the disappointing ""The Hunted"" would have done well to mimic the terse sensibilities that served ""First Blood"" so well.",1064275200,,1843,4.884615384615385
72089,4,0784011370,"This 1982 film introduced the character ""John Rambo"", and was followed by other films that portrayed a powerful but misunderstood superhero. Rambo is arrested for walking through a small town, but makes his escape against great odds. He flees into the wilderness, Sheriff Teasel's men in hot pursuit. [Does this remind you of some early Hitchcock films?] The many forces combined against one man prove unequal. [""A Fistful of Dollars"" or ""Yojimbo""?] Like some Hitchcock films, the visuals are used more than dialog for the story.
Most of the film is devoted to the hunt for Rambo in the cold, rainy forest. Rambo eludes his pursuers, the hunted becomes the hunter. The dead and wounded are brought out of the wilderness. The forces against Rambo are escalated, yet success eludes them. Colonel Trautmann, who trained Rambo to be the best killing machine, shows up to confront the Sheriff, and attempts to end the conflict by a political solution (""let him go, get him later"").
The burning gas station echoes that scene in ""The Birds"", a film about Nature taking revenge. Shooting into electrical transformers creates a blackout that is all too familiar. The explosions and fires are another disaster. Does the ending with the Colonel remind you of Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men""? While Rambo walks away, the rest of the story is left to your imagination.
The military trains its guard dogs to be vicious, and to obey only their handler. When the handler leaves the service, his dog is destroyed; it has outlived its usefulness. This film is important as an example of propaganda in the movies. A psychotic drifter who kills police and National Guardsmen is portrayed as a hero! Could this happen in real life?

72090,4,0784011370,"Before it became one of the most cliche'-ridden action franchises in history, the saga of John Rambo was actually a very compelling and moving one.  Much like actor Sylvester Stallone's other famed movie franchise 'Rocky', this series debuted with a story that was built upon elements of the human condition and focused on the interactions of the main characters.  Where as the sequels in both series resorted to pandering story lines and overblown plot devices, the originals were well crafted.

The first episode in the Rambo saga, 'First Blood' (it was not called 'Rambo', despite what many moviegoers think.) tells the tragic tale of a Vietnam veteran's inability to return to a normal life in his own mind and the inability of many people to let him because of their own feelings about that misbegotten war.  John Rambo (Stallone) was a highly trained Army killing who machined who commanded well-trained men and operated high-priced military machinery.  He was Congressional Medal of Honor winner for whom there was no honor to be found when he returned home. All Rambo wanted to do was find an old Army buddy and grab a bite to eat in a small town as he made through and onto to wherever his next destination would be.  Unfortunately, the prejudices and hatreds of a small-town sheriff's department and its vile, redneck sheriff, Will Teasle (played with slimy intensity by Brian Dennehy) just can't leave Rambo in peace.  Teasle harasses and taunts Rambo before arresting him on a nebulous charge of 'vagrancy'.  While in lockdown, the mistreatment his receives at the hand of other members of the sheriff's department triggers horrifying memories of his time in a P.O.W. camp and he snaps.  Rambo attacks the abusive officers and then escapes to the mountains overlooking this sleepy town.  Not content to let well-enough alone, Teasle and his men follow him into the mountains where Rambo's Green Beret training makes the odds of 8 to 1 (and later 200 to 1) turn in favor of the 1.  Teasle was warned: 'Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe.'

'First Blood' deconstructs the world as Rambo has come to know it.  It's an unforgiving one for Vietnam veterans and the mercilessness of some people's perceptions of the men who fought that war made the United States as inhospitable a place for them as the thickest jungles in 'Nam.  Rambo wants to forget and move on, but most of all, he just wants to be left alone.  His battle with the sheriff and his deputies isn't about attrition or killing, it's about survival.  He doesn't kill the men after him; he just incapacitates them.  Rambo is the quintessential anti-hero whose plight we can empathize with, if not sympathize.  You understand the world he is facing and what made him flip the way he did.  While certainly not as well known or publicized as its glitzier sequels, 'First Blood' is an underrated gem worth investing 90 minutes in.",1059350400,,2916,4.807615230460922

I read the book it was based on and although it's different (ie, Rambo dies in the end by the hand of his mentor Trautman,his escape by dirt bike actually takes place with him being naked and having to supply himself from local mountain men, he's also more of a hippie in the novel whereas in the film he's a ""full blooded combat soldier""), but that isn't such a bad thing.
I really think that critics don't enough credit to Stallone for his performance in this film especially when it pertains to the final scene between Rambo and Trautman where he breaks down emotionally and recounts all of the horrors of war he has seen first hand and how special he was in Nam, but as a civilian he can't get a job parking cars. The desperation and pain he portrays as he practically begs to be forgiven for becoming a killing machine is like a son asking to be forgiven by his father.
I've spoken with a lot of vets at Veteran's Hospitals and VFW's over the years as a volunteer and they always mention that in my conversations with them that this film was step in the healing process to some of them and their families. That it helped them come to as what Col. Trautman calls ""Full Circle"".
One of the best extras that I can think of is actually a commentary by the author David Morrell. It helps to explain a lot of the details that usually are glossed over in action films and makes the experience more emotionally exciting.",1057622400,,1581,4.290969899665551
72095,4,0784011370,"While I do appreciate getting both Full & Widescreen versions of this film in the twin-disk package, the lack of any meaningful extras brings the the rating for this DVD set down considerably.

72096,5,0784011370,"The film centers on John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a vietnam vet and Congressional Medal of Honer winner, who has gone from a Green Beret to a drifter upon his return from 'nam. He has recieved the same harsh treatment by people who, if they went to Vietnam with Rambo, would understand the whole thing better, and know what they were talking about. After trying to visit a war buddy, and finding out that he recently died from Agent Orange, he tries to pass through the small town of Hope, Oregon and is given trouble by sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who, after Ram,bo tries to re-enter town after Teasle drops him off at the city limits, arrests him for vagrancy. Leaving Rambo to the deputies, one of them who takes delight in abusing him, he is beaten, sprayed with a fire hose, and nearly shaved - dry, which would really hurt, by the way. These incidents trigger his 'nam memories, and he escapes, heading for the woods. Teasle takes a posse into the woods in pursuit, and they all end up injured, with one dead due to his own stupidity and no fault of Rambo's. After the battle has been on for a while, the government sends Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna), the colonel who trained Rambo and his unit, to try and get Rambo to surrender. When he won't give up, he tells Teasle that he needs one thing when he deals with Rambo: ""a good supply of body bags"".
This special edition DVD from Artisan has a lot of goodies, plus great sound and video. The extras start with a commentary by the novel's writer David Morrell, who, among other things, tells the differences between the book and the movie (which includes the ending, which I will not spoil here. Plus he did the novelizations of the two sequels, which have the characterization that was needed.). He is a good speaker, and the track is fun to listen to. Next up is a documentary entitled DRAWING FIRST BLOOD: CREATING JOHN RAMBO, where the creators of the movie talk about the adaptation of the novel to the screen. Then the usual production notes, cast and crew information, and trailers. all in all, not a bad package. I also recommend the novel and the soundtrack for the excellent closing credits song and Jerry Goldsmith score.

72097,5,0784011370,"A former green beret (Stallone) journeys into the northwest on foot to find an old army buddy who he finds has passed away. He walks into the nearest town to get a bite to eat but the sheriff (Brian Dennehy) doesn't want his kind around. He gives Rambo a ride out of town and informs him the next town is only 30 miles away. Rambo doesn't have to take this. He turns around and heads back but Dennehy sees him doubling back, arrests him and takes him to the police station. He gets fingerprinted, then they decide he needs a shave and this is where all the trouble starts. He has flashbacks from Vietnam and sees the Vietcong holding a razor to his face and goes berserk. He gets away, steals a motorcycle and heads for the mountains. Dennehy goes after him but ends up crawling out of his vehicle while it sits perched upside down. Now the manhunt begins, only the odds are in Rambo's favor (""those green berets, they're real badasses""). Rambo is skilled in every facet of guerilla warfare. Six cops with rifles and three dogs just aren't enough. Before it's all over Rambo has caused enough destruction to declare the place a disaster area. And it all started because some cop (Dennehy)wouldn't let him stop in town and get something to eat (""Why you pushin' me""?). Plenty of action. Dennehy plays his usual part; hard nosed and stubborn. It's his way or no way, regardless of the consequences. David Caruso is a deputy in this movie and Richard Crenna is Rambo's former Colonel. Acted well by all.",1053129600,7,1500,4.538745387453875
72098,4,0784011370,"First Blood is an extremely important film but perhaps not for the chest-thuming nationalism that somewhat spoils its compelling climax. First Blood taps more importantly into themes of homosexuality and masculinity. The nature of Rambo's relationship with the old war ""buddy"" he seeks in Small town, USA is never fully explained, his rage at not finding him never entirely clarified. The viewer is invited to empathise with Rambo's cause, not because we can relate to him, but because he is rhe ideal attractive yet vulnerable male. Given that the target audience of this film is young men it is entirely reasonable to suggest that an exploration of homosexuality is a deliberate sub-theme. For those in doubt it is worth considering Stallone himself in this and the subsequent Rambo films. Long haired and muscles bulging, it is not hard to imagine what the decidedly phallic weapon he holds at the ready represents.

I was skeptical, but after watching this movie I have to admit that Sylvester Stalone is a much better actor than I ever gave him credit for. I always dismissed him as a beefcake not-much-dialog tough guy; this movie... well, it doesn't break that mold, but it shows you a bit more depth than you might imagine.

72107,5,0784011370,"The Rambo franchise began not as a mindless, flag-waving action saga, but as a thoughtful exploration of post-Vietnam America. Unfortunately, the second and third installments in the franchise were cheesy 80's action, which is how the character of John Rambo has been remembered; a cartoonish killing machine. Initially, Rambo was an innocent man, shocked by redneck local cops into reliving his Vietnam experience, and could not stop himself from reacting. Yet even so, Rambo knows right from wrong, prefering clear demonstrations of his military training in place of simply killing his enemies.
In this first film, impression was far worse than truth; Rambo kills no one, and the only obvious death (and later, an implied death in a car crash), are not directly caused by anti-hero Rambo. However, the film was (and still is), accused of being flooded with violence and killing.
If you take a moment and think past the stunts and the action, Rambo's search for place in a country unwilling to acknowledge his sacrifices is a poignant and striking portrayal of what Vietnam vets really faced upon their return home. No one wanted to think about the war, and our vets were a painful reminder to a nation's fragile ego that we had lost.
In the 1980's, acceptance gradually dawned, and Vietnam became a popular subject for movies. The movies became a sort of national catharsis, allowing us to heal through fantasies, such as a Special Forces vet going back to 'Nam and killing a bunch of VC, freeing POWs, and taking revenge in a typically red, white, and blue fashion. The second Rambo film and Chuck Norris' ""Missing in Action"" series are typical of the war as portrayed by Hollywood in the 80's.
""First Blood"" was one of the first films to deal with the scars of Vietnam intellegently. That's right; an intellegent action film about the effect of the Vietnam war. Unlike the book, the John Rambo of the film is not so much a psychotic killer as he is a deeply hurt and emotionally damaged human being. The final confrontation and Vietnam ""speech"" are a wonderful, moving, and thoughtful commentary on the travesty inflicted on our soldiers by a thoughtless American public.
The cinematography and direction are excellent, and Stallone gives the best performance of his career as the troubled veteran. Great locations and action highlight one of the most important mainstream films of the early 80's.",1030838400,3,2401,4.960297766749379

But as he walks into a small town he is quickly harassed by a local lawman. John tries to keep his cool as the foul mouthed law man escorts him back to the end of the city limits, basically letting him know that he is not welcomed. But, as the sheriff drives away, he looks in his rear view mirror to find John making his way back into town. Infuriated, the sheriff stops this time and arrests John, even though he had done nothing wrong, BIG MISTAKE!!! You see John is an ex Green Beret, and one of the Army's best. Once John is taken into the police department, he is roughed up by deputies left and right. But, when they try to clean him up and give him a shave, John has a flash back to when he was a POW. He see's the razor as a knife, and he goes off the deep end. He royally kicks butt, and makes his escape out into the wilderness. As the search for him begins, the posse quickly learns that this is no run-of-the-mill kind of guy, he's smart, very smart. Once he's out in the wilderness, John quickly regains his wits, and studies how to make his next move. Lots of drama, lots of action, suspense, and terror. Does he make it out alive?

72111,5,0784011370,"In an age of cinema largely ruled by computer generated wizardry, FIRST BLOOD is a welcome throwback to an area where technologically created villains didn't yet exist.
In the simplest version of a story ever told, boy (John Rambo) meets boy (Wilford Teasle), boy (Teasle) hates boy (Rambo), and testosterone breaks out all over the place.  After refusing to be run out of town, John Rambo is roughed up by several redneck police officers in the Pacific Northwest (what are they doing with rednecks?).  Before you can say ""pass the ammo,"" this former Special Forces Green Beret is enduring a flashback to his glory days in Vietnam, and the town will never be the same ... literally.
On board are Sylvester Stallone (back in the days when he was a 'serious' actor), the incomparable Brian Dennehy (who's starting to appear as regularly as Michael Caine in films), and Richard Crenna.  Also, as a guilty pleasure, look for the youthful redheaded cop who's none other than David Caruso in his pre-NYPD BLUE days.
What works best about FIRST BLOOD is the tension-filled story of unrelenting action; once this film reaches a fever pitch, it truly never lets up.  As the producers discuss in the documentary accompanying the film, FIRST BLOOD really set the standard for all other action films to follow.  Upon this most recent viewing, the influence of this franchise on other similar outings is readily apparent.
A dynamic presentation, the Dolby 5.1 sound leaves a bit to be desired (as does the DTS).  However, the commentary track (featuring best-selling FIRST BLOOD author David Morrell) is a fabulous exploration of the book-to-screen cycle so prevalent in Hollywood, sprinkled with tidbits about the movie-making process, actors originally attacked to the roles of Rambo and his mentor (Colonel Samuel Trautman), and (believe it or not) the use of iconographic and mythological symbols in the telling of the first (and best) of the Rambo tales.
The extras here (a new documentary, production notes, etc.) are fairly standard fare, but the preservation of the film is worth the price of at least the first installment of this popular feature film franchise.",1022716800,33,2158,5.030812324929972

First Blood does sport some very well done action, especially with Rambo on the mountain setting traps, leaping off a cliff and trekking through a dark mine shaft. However the movie focuses too much on typical ""stupid cops"" who break the rules and way too much emphasis on anti-Vietnam war statements even though the war was far over after this. Its too one-sided, and too angry and Stallone's quote at the end a about a memory of Vietnam has been heard all too many times before.

72116,4,0784011370,"Stallone might be the main actor here, but Brian Denahy (one of America's most-loved character actors), who plays a ... cop in a small Pacific Northwest town, sums up the film's message best, when asked by Rambo, ""why are you pushin' me?""  Denahy's response is a brilliant summation of the insidious fascist collectivism lying at the root of our nation's alleged ""rugged individuality"", and serves to provoke the heroic rallying cry of Rambo's gallant non-conformism:
""First of all, you don't ask the questions around here.  I do.  You understand?  Secondly, we don't want guys like you in this town.  Drifters.  First thing you know we got a whole bunch a guys like you in this town.  That's why.  Besides, you wouldn't like it here . . . this is . . .  this is a quiet little town.

A challenge indeed.  The battle table is now set, and before it's all over, Rambo will have outrun, outwitted, and seriously crippled a dozen sadistic police officers (as well as a few good family men), a whole platoon of national guardsmen, and a few tracking dogs to boot.  Rambo is a monster, a Frankenstein, created by the masters of war in the Pentagon, and now they're reaping the fruits of their own bitter harvest.  However, this is one Frankenstein that fights his battles in a half-hearted manner, dragged down by an inner conflict of will.  We see in the film's opening sequence that Rambo has not felt grounded in reality since returning from the `Nam.  The ""junk in your pockets"" that he complains about is apt symbolism for the collected junk inside John Rambo's tortured mind.  And Denahy's small-town fear of outsiders manifests itself in a self-destructive war with a one-man army, an apt metaphor for America's cultural civil war -- the wounds of Vietnam reappearing as enduring political cleavages during the late Cold War period.",1015286400,,1938,4.70326409495549
72117,4,0784011370,"""First Blood"" was the film that rejuvenated Sylvester Stallone's then floundering career. After the successes of ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky 2"", Stallone found himself in some movies that, while good, failed to do any business at the box office. ""First Blood"" broke that streak, would go on to gross $120 million worldwide, and helped make Stallone one of the top action icons of the 1980's.
""First Blood"" is the story of John Rambo, a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who returns to America after escaping from a POW camp in 'Nam, only to find that it's a different America than the one he left. When he arrives, he gets called a ""baby-killer"" and spat upon by protestors who view the United States' and his involvement in the war as less than honorable. With nowhere to go, he becomes a drifter, a ""forgotten hero"".
The film starts with Rambo hiking in the Pacific Northwest, looking for his only surviving buddy from 'Nam. When he arrives at his friend's place, he is saddened to learn that he has passed away from cancer due to exposure to Agent Orange in the war. An upset Rambo then finds himself in a small town where the local sheriff tells him that the town doesn't want someone like him there, and drives him to the city limits. Defiant, Rambo heads toward the town again, only to be arrested and charged with vagrancy. As he is being processed, harassment by the police officers triggers flashbacks of the brutal torture he suffered in Vietnam, and he escapes. He commandeers a motor bike and heads to the mountains, where he takes on the sheriff's posse, and ultimately 200 National Guardsmen. A trained Green Beret, he escapes his pursuers, setting up the climactic showdown between Rambo and the sheriff.
Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rambo, and his speech at the end of the film , where he bares his soul and relates to his commanding officer (and in essence, us as well) the suffering he has endured, both during and after the war, is chilling. Character actor Brian Dennehy also turns in a great peformance as Sheriff Will Teasle, the man who pushes Rambo and draws ""first blood"" in this war. Also appearing is Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's C.O. in 'Nam, who gets one of the best bits of dialogue when he describes Rambo and his elite training, with almost father-like pride (""Rambo's been trained to ignore pain... to ignore the weather... to live off the land... to eat things that would make a billy goat puke"") to a defiant Teasle. All 3 men give strong performances throughout.
The DVD has some pretty good features, among them a trivia game (with some true bafflers!), a trailer, production notes, a featurette on the film (which plays more like an expanded trailer), and commentary by ""First Blood"" author David Morrell. It certainly is interesting to hear him compare the film version with the book that he wrote (one of the main differences in the film script being that Rambo lives; in the novel, he dies on the last page). All this is held together by some neat motion menus.
The film is in a widescreen anamorphic format, although the picture leaves a bit to be desired, with some color fading and scratches throughout. The soundtrack is in Dolby Stereo, and sounds dated. It's not necessarily that bad, though, as most of the film is dialogue-driven throughout, with the exception being the last 1/3 of the film, when Rambo returns to the town.
I give the DVD 4 stars, because this is one of those films that would have been served well with a better digital re-mastering of the print, and a 5.1 soundtrack. I give the actual film 5 stars, because this is one of those films that strikes a chord with everyone. Far from the outrageous action-oriented and almost cartoonishly violent sequels that would follow, ""First Blood"" is basically a psychological story about a man who is trained as a killing machine for war, yet finds out that when he comes back from that war, he can't just ""turn it off"". Rambo leaves his wide-eyed innocence back in 'Nam, and when pushed around by Teasle and his posse, he reverts back to that which he knows best: Defeating the enemy by any means necessary. It's certainly well worth it to sit down and watch Stallone in his 1st portrayal of Rambo, playing him as the haunted man who can't escape his past, as opposed to the later films where he would become an unstoppable killing machine who would grunt and yell his way to almost implausible victory. Highly recommended.",1013126400,3,4458,4.7093469910371315

of John Rambo,an Army Green Beret. Stallone is going to visit an old war friend when he wanders into the wrong town. He is arrested and treated bad by the local sheriff played well by Brian Dennehy. Rambo retaliates and escapes. The local sheriff's department face the battle of their lives with Rambo. His vast
knowledge of jungle warfare goes well in the mountains of the
surrounding area. Rambo's old commander(played by Richard Crenna)
comes in to save the Sheriff's Department from Rambo. This is a

72126,4,0784011370,"In the beginning of the eighties ,""Rambo"" seemed to come from nowhere , but winded up setting the standard for a long series of films , in which the main theme was violence and carnage brought to the extreme.
""Rambo"" is indeed which it was the opening shot for, but also has an extra value included - the violence stands for something you can understand, sympathy and identify with.

When released, Stallone was already a big star after the three Rockies. It turned up that Rambo has established his stature to even a higher ground, and would be the character he'd be most recognized with worldwide from that day on.

An ex-green berets, Vietnam War fighter wanders through the wrong All-American small town. He is captured and tormented for no obvious reason. Manages to escape and consequently is hunted down and decides to fight back and retaliate.

There is one thing I dare to claim not as many as before remember , or attribute major importance to , and that's the closing speech of Rambo , which embodies the essence of the entire movie , and clarifies its message in a crystal clear way . This monologue gives the film its right to exist and to stand tall along with other influencing motion pictures of that time . I think that in this single scene Stallone gave one of the best performances of his life .

After all that had happened - all the blood that had been spilled, all the men that had been killed , all the suffering so many had suffered , all the agony , pain and horror - after almost killing the man that had been responsible, in Rambo's view, to it all - he bursts out crying in the presence of his training officer and mentor , Colonel Trautman , and finally start talking . Watching this scene is so hard that tears might fill your eyes , because all the wrong and unjust in regard to the treatment of America of Post Vietnam War towards its returning soldiers is cried out loud ; Rambo and so many other soldiers came back to the U.S , as victims and survivors of the horrors of Vietnam , only to discover that not so many had missed them . The frustration of the American society from the fiasco in Vietnam was thrown in the faces of those lost boys , that did not understand what hit them .

All this burden and more is vented in the mentioned above Epilogue , and there is no comfort in any reply Trautman could come up with , because there is no excuse to these sins of society that represent the ugly side of human nature . Stallone plays convincingly like he really was Rambo - a victim and a want to be survivor of the gloomy reality , and you then can better understand him - what he was all about , why , his violence , rage and the bloodshed he so expertly conducted .

At that time (1982) , nearly ten years after the end of the war , these issues were still troubling , burning and unresolved in he American society . Nowadays , even twenty years after the movie has hit the screens , I think that not everything is forgiven and people still suffer from the consequences of that war . Maybe this movie , among many others that were made on the same subject (""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Born On The Fourth Of July"" to mention a few), should stand as a memoriam to the personal , often swept away , problems caused by wars , and for the terrible price single individuals must pay if they manage to stay alive and survive hell . The war these soldiers face at home is , sometimes , even harder .",1007164800,,3425,4.285935085007728

The commentary by David Morrell is excellent.  Some commentary tracks are pretty dry, but Morrell's commentary is actually entertaining to listen to.",998092800,3,324,4.440677966101695
72129,5,0784011370,"The latest DVD version of the classic Stallone action flick provides several supplemental features, the most notable being the outstanding commentary by David Morrell who wrote the novel the film is based on. More on that in a moment.

First Blood is about a Vietnam vet named John Rambo who comes to a small Washington state town (actually British Columbia) to find the last surviving comrade from his elite Green Beret unit. When he discovers that he too is dead, Rambo makes his way into town for a bite to eat and instead winds up being arrested by the hick local sheriff (Brian Dennehy). While in custody, Rambo is abused by the locals but manages to escape sparking an all out manhunt.

This film has 55 minutes of action out of 96 total highlighted by the jail escape and subsequent chase. Jack Starrett is great as the cop that does most of the abusing while Davis Caruso is fine as the only deputy (among the surprisingly large local force) that seems to have a conscience. Dennehy is good as always and makes a worthy opponent for Rambo. Richard Crenna is great as Rambo's former CO and he and Dennehy play off one another quite well. Even though he has limited speaking parts, this is probably one of Stallone's best performances highlighted by the ""Vietnam speech"" near the end of the film.

The film is presented in digitally remastered widescreen 16:9, and is without a doubt the best video presentation of First Blood to date. The movie was shot in the temperate rain forest of BC and is quite dark at times. However, the darkest scenes have been enhanced here and are much improved over the various VHS versions some of which are terrible. Sound is Dolby 2.0 only but not bad considering. Also included are a cute trivia game (get all 10 right without a mistake to see a Rambo cartoon), production notes, and a teaser and trailer. The ""featurette"" is nothing more than a glorified trailer.

Now on to the best feature of this DVD, one that is worth the price of admission all by itself. If you are at all interested in how films are made and the behind the scenes tidbits about Hollywood, then RUN do not walk (or let your fingers do the walking online) to your local video store and get this disc. Why? For the outstanding commentary of writer David Morrell. This talented man begins to speak before the opening credits and does not stop for 96 minutes. When he does you will wish he could have continued for 96 more. You will find yourself listening again and again and picking up something new each time. This is without a doubt far and away the best commentary on any DVD.

Here is just a partial list of the things Morrell covers:

1. The many differences between his novel and the film-very fascinating stuff.
2. His experience when seeing First Blood the very first time.
3. The three act structure of films.
4. How he chose the name Rambo and other character names.
5. How First Blood set a number of precedents for the industry.
6. Why films were kept to 90 minutes in length for so long a time.
7. A touching story about his son and Stallone.
8. The story of how Kirk Douglas was scheduled to play Troutman and why Richard Crenna ended up with the role.

And that is only scratching the surface.

In conclusion, First Blood was a precedent setting film featuring top-flight actors and some of the best believable screen action. The wonderful commentary of David Morrell caps off a great experience.

NOTE***

This review was first written in 2001. There are now several DVD versions of the film available. Check the special features carefully as the David Morrell commentary DOES NOT appear on all. It IS NOT included on the latest ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD. There is a commentary by Stallone instead as well as some other new features. I prefer the ""Special Edition"" version but you may want both if you are a fan.",997401600,73,3838,4.581632653061225
72130,5,0784011370,"Don't let Rambo's reputation fool you. If your only familiarity with that name is from the press or it's use in modern lingo, you probably would have come to expect that ""First Blood"" is a mindless gore-fest. That couldn't be further from the truth.
John Rambo is a Green Beret who was held in a POW camp in Nam. Having been brutally tortured there, he suffers from post-traumatic stress, which causes his encounter with a small town sheriff to go awry. Stallone portrays Rambo with the perfect mix of sensitivity and stoicism to make him both human and the warrior he was trained to be.
Rambo enters the little Pacific Northwestern town searching for an old war buddy whom he learns has died. After being arrested by Sheriff Teasle, horrible flashbacks of his POW experience send Rambo into a panic in which he violently attacks the police officers and flees. Teasle is determined to hunt him down, but his efforts are thwarted by Rambo's traps and war survival prowess. When Rambo's trainer, Trautman, appears on the scene, an intriguing dynamic develops between he and Teasle as they argue over Rambo's fate.
The characters are well-developed and well-acted, and the film makes some interesting statements about war. The violence, which is tame by today's standards, is used as a tool to tell the story without being gratuitous. This is one of the best of the classic '80's films and i highly recommend it to anyone who likes action movies with substance.",995673600,3,1458,4.836
72131,5,0784011370,"The two roles Sylvester Stallone is most well-known for are Rocky and Rambo. Comedians used to have a field day pointing out that the two characters are virtually the same the reason being that Sly can't act so he only plays characters that are just like him: muscle-bound men with little intelligence, a good heart, and ambitions of rising above their current situation. There are many similarities between the two characters but there are many differences as well. The careful observer notices those differences and realizes that Sly is a much more talented artist than most people will give him credit for.
Nowhere is this more clear than in FIRST BLOOD. When most people think of Rambo they have an image of Sly with a red headband firing a M-16, blowing people away in a jungle somewhere. This is not the John Rambo of FIRST BLOOD (well at least not until the last twenty-five minutes of the movie). The John Rambo of FIRST BLOOD is a discouraged Vietnam veteran walking across the country trying to locate the only other surviving buddy of his from Vietnam. He soon discovers that his friend has died from cancer caused by Agent Orange. With no family, no friends, a government who has abandoned him, and a nation that scorns him, John Rambo becomes a lonely drifter. No big deal, except he drifts into a town that isn't very hospitable to strangers. The local sheriff literally drives Rambo away, but arrests him after he comes back. What the local law enforcement doesn't realize is that Rambo is a ticking time-bomb; a killing machine prone to war flashbacks. What follows is a great acion-filled hunt between Rambo and a timid sheriff and his local yokels set in the beautiful American northwest.
FIRST BLOOD is a great movie. It suffers from a few flaws typical of the 1980's action genre (invincible men who only suffer from the occasional deep wound). However, it is also a film exploring a part of American society (now virually history) that many would rather forget. Though there aren't as many abuses to Vietnam veterans as there used to be and many sins have been attoned for, there is still a great deal of prejudice in our country. That prejudice is just a fraction of the ever-dividing culture war that is ripping the United States apart. FIRST BLOOD and John Rambo are a testament of what can happen if the elite continue to ignore the common man and push him too far.",989798400,2,2390,4.706443914081145
72132,5,0784011370,"Some people merely regard ""First Blood"" and the entire Rambo series as brainless, macho action movies. Nothing could be further from the truth. Though the first movie emphasizes it the most, John Rambo is a symbol of many brave men who fought for their country in the politician's war known as Vietnam. ""First Blood"" shows the reality of how many of the men were treated when they came home, and how it was often difficult to cope with the training and things they'd endured in the war. There's no sugar-coating in David Morrell's outstanding novel, or the movie itself. Rambo is targeted by biggotry from the beginning by town sheriff Will Teasle, played superbly by Brian Dennehy. When he fights back, it's the way the government trained him to: no holds barred and violent. When you watch ""First Blood"", try to look past the action for a second and see the human factor it portrays....a factor that is very real.",978393600,3,915,4.725
72133,5,0784011370,"This is arguably Sly's greatest action movie to date.  Unlike most action films, this one has an excellent story intertwined with all the action.  This movie needs to be watched in widescreen format, in order to take in all it's glory!  It is a must have for Stallone fans.  Moreover, it easily tops the other Rambo movies(II & III), because it doesn't have to rely on just action to be a great movie.  Get this one, you won't be sorry!",976579200,2,436,4.4
72134,4,0784011370,"This first Rambo movie is actually pretty entertaining.  Rambo isn't the self-righteous hero as he is a lost soul, providing strong parallels to Frankenstein's Monster.  Those who have read Mary Shelley's novel may recall that the monster was given life but could not die.  This also seems to be Rambo's dilemma.  All of his friends have died, but even though he throughs himself off a cliff into some trees, he manages to escape with only a few injuries.  Rambo is a man looking for comfort who is misunderstood because of a monstrous appearance.  Col. Trautman fills the role of Dr. Frankenstein -- The first words out of his mouth are ""God didn't invent Rambo.  I did.""  But unlike Dr. Frankenstein who abandoned his monster, Col. Trautman came to take responsibilty for his creation, to try to calm him down.
Now let me sing the praises of the commentary on this disk, given by author David Morrell. He never stops providing constant insight into comparing his book to the film, how the Rambo phenomena has influenced his life, an analysis of the character of Rambo as he is supposed to be representative of the Liberals (surprising as the sequels seemed to be more Republican in theme) and how the Rambo character ties into the Heroic cycle, praise of the music cues as well as certain action sequences.  He also talks about the movie cycle on the whole and how with each movie Rambo became more & more invincible, and his knife got larger & larger.  David Morrell's commentary is the best that I have encountered on any DVD anywhere.  Even those who hate the Rambo movies may find enjoyment in David Morrell's commentary.",975888000,6,1627,4.73404255319149

72137,4,0784011370,"Before I saw ""First Blood"", I thought it would be a stupid Action movie, you know the typical ""good and bad"" cliches and a  lot of pointless shootouts. I was certainly wrong. Stallone isn't a good  guy at all, he doesn't safe any poor widows from evil villans like  Van-Damme loved to do in a bunch of terrible movies, he rather seems tragic  and confused, I think he really got an Actors part in this movie. Although,  there are a lot of weak points in this movie ( 1. I think the message that  this movie intends (?) to deliver doesn't come across that clearly 2. The  Policemen are actually more stupid than the Victims in any ""Friday the  13th"" movies, just take that one scene where the evil sherrif's car  gets crashed because HE DROVE DIRECTLY INTO A PILE OF STONES! 3. I always  knew there is a tunnel-system in the forest but nobody belived me... ) I  think it is better than most people expect it to be. It manages to make you  think a little, and that is by far more than I expect from an action-movie.  They had to make two sequels that are exactly what I thought this film  would be, avoid them and give this one a fair try!",966124800,3,1137,4.227906976744186
72138,3,0784011370,"John Rambo doesn't have much to say.  He's just a wanderer who entered a small town where they don't like Drifters much.
In many movies Brian  Dennehy would be the typical badguy.  He would be sort of like the fascist  Donald Sutherland ""warden"" character in that Stallone prison film  ""Lock down"".  But he's not.  In fact many people would probably  tell him that he's doing a good job, keeping the vagrants out in a  professional manner.
However, John Rambo is not the usual bum.  He has  flashbacks and can't tell the difference between Vietnamese Captains and  Chris Mulkey.  Sylvester Stallone has a great physical presense in this  movie.  You believe that he is a hardened Green Beret who can go through 10  cops without breaking a sweat.  And his ""escape"" is well handled  as well, with the magnificient West coast forests providing great  scenery.
The movie gets the message across that there are no good guys  and no bad guys, just victims.  John Rambo is a victim of the US Government  who trained him to be a killing machine then abandons him, leaving him with  nightmares and a body full of scars and signs of Agent Orange.  That and  the fact he can't get a job and his fellow American hates the ""Child  murderers"" of Vietnam.
And the police are victims as well, having to  capture/kill this unstable killing machine.
The DVD is a clean copy and  it has a difficult job.  It has to high light the mistiness of the Oregon  forrest, as well as provide good contrast between the background and  foreground.  While other discs do a better job (ie. Last of the Mohicans),  this is a acceptable transfer.  The sound is good as well.  However it is  unfortunate that they left the last song to go to Sly's brother Frank.  He  stinks as a singer and actor...

The music that goes with this scene is SO intense.

The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.
