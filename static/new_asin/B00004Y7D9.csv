7926988,4,B00004Y7D9,"Franois (Frdric Pierrot) is stressed and he wants to get away from the hectic life in Paris.  This leads to Franois planning a new years celebration trip away from the stressfulness of technology, time, and countdowns.  The trip takes Franois's family and his friends to the island of Sanguinaires off the French coast in the Mediterranean Sea.  The arrival to the island is a rough start as the caretaker is late, which serves as a negative omen for the film as it unfolds.  Sanguinaires is a small film where the story dissects group interactions between sub-groups, individuals, and their notions.  Cantet's vision of this dissection offers an excellent cinematic experience as the cast provides great support to a story of a Millennium celebration that goes astray.",1075593600,2,769,5.071428571428571
7926989,3,B00004Y7D9,"This film which was an Official Cannes Film Festival Selction, is the story of a group that retreats to a small Island to escape the celebration of the New Millenium.  Francoise, is the ""Lead Scout"", he finds the location, plans the trip and makes the rules.  No TV, no radios, no party.  The group of about 15 is game at first, but many tire of the rules and want to do their own thing.  Francoise shows us that there is no escape from the our self, from out own mind.  Those things which cause his petulence and sulkiness come from within and will be with him wherever he goes.  The Director, Laurent Cantent, also shows us that one can't escape from the crowds if one brings a crowd along, i.e. if you are a control freak, vacation by your self.  This short (68 minute) film saves the drama for the end so don't give up during the early doldrums of the plot.  The film presents a fine portrayal of Francoise's conflicts over control, escape and criticism but one comes away feeling that one just ate a Chinese Dinner.  An hour later one is hungry for a French film with a little more substance.",986601600,4,1097,4.364532019704433
