8606340,2,B00EKGX34K,"This is a disappointing DVD. I anticipated something extraordinary, with the Vienna Philharmonic in its prime and Solti leading several works with which he was closely associated. The performances are technically impeccable but boring. Solti looks matter-of-fact and fails to infuse the men of the orchestra with his usual fire. They just sit there like mushrooms, playing their parts, and seeming entirely uninvolved. The sound is average sixties mono, clear enough, but with a restricted dynamic range. The black-and-white camera work is unimaginative and often misses important solos, etc. There are a number of videos of Solti later in his career that are much better in showing what he was all about.",1483056000,,705,5.303571428571429
