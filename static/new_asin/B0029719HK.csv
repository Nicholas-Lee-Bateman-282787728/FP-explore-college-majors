8357637,5,B0029719HK,"About Norma Shearer, and the film, ''We were dancing''.
Norma Shearer is a difficult star to understand, and as a person: utterly remote to us, the viewers.  I think she can be accessed if her career is divide in to three parts.  The silent films.  The pre-code work, and then what I would describe as her showcase period.  Recently featured as a T.C.M. star of the month I was able to watch some of her silent films.  I am not patient with silent films.  One of the best silent actors was Marion Davies, as she was so fun to look at.  Most of us will never savor a silent film.

Norma is so very special in her pre-code films.  When she talked on the screen, she was able to add the mannerisms of the silent films to the voice and bring out a sexy sensual dramatic and funny Norma that audiences loved.  Her voice was magic.  Like an opera diva, Norma had a range to her voice that ran from the depths of low bass tones, add the mid-range with a bit of coloratura, and end with the soprano high tones of a Tosca interpretation.  And she could do all of this in a paragraph of short dialogue.  Soft and LOUD and then immediately bring treacherous dialogue recited in a whisper.  The public loved her.  In her pre-code films she did it all, and it looked effortless and real.  She was real.  Photographs show a person having fun.  She was said to be a bit of a rebel, but her friends colleagues and fans loved her for it.  M.G.M. employed her during her working career.  She had the best.  The master costume designer Adrian did her costumes and between the two refined her look.  Her brother Douglas Shearer, was M.G.M.'s top sound technician and he made sure that Norma sounded like Norma..  I am ignoring Irving Thalberg here, as Norma proved she did not need him.

After the Code cam in Norma was forced to change her image.  M.G.M. accomplished this transition by having Norma do these ''prestege'' showcase films.  And to so-so return on the dollar. These showcase films are the movies that are remembered.  ''Romeo and Juliette'',  such a long film and they both die and we know that going in to the film.  ''Marie Antoinette''  Again, the film takes forever, but at the end of it one has to agree, that Norma was nearly magnificent.  Her most fun movie, ''The Women''.  She is so superb, her voice doing all these miracle sounds, as she suffers and triumphs in this eternal classic.  Some critics have basically said, that ''The Women'' denigrates Shearer, distracts us form her ideal work.  Nah!!!!  ''The Women kept her name alive until her body of work could be re-examined.  It is said that Norma worried about aging.  At 37 in ''The Women'', she shows no particular age.  Her body is a bit more voluptuous which is quite nice, she was a very sexy lady.  The same year, 1939, she made ''Idiots Delight'' with Clark Gable.  In a blond pageboy wig Norma eats up the screen in a Garboesque accent, Wow!!.  In 1940 Shearer mad the film ''Escape'', next to the actress Nazimova, she looks like a teen.  The movie is and was well received.

In the year ''We were Dancing'' was made, 1942, Norma was 40.  ''We were Dancing'' is not a bad film.  Recently at a holiday get together people were talking, and they were not saying much.  Someone in the family will not speak to the person talking after the divorce.  The school teacher doesn't understand, and the marriage is on it's last legs............... etc.  The way people talk.  ''We were Dancing'' attempts to do that, as viewers we cut in,,, to this moment that will carry us through the film.  But.

The way Norma is presented is unkind.  The clothes were not flattering, her weight is a distraction, and she lightened her hair and it looks dry and unlike her.  Lines that had not been there before are there: the lighting is cruel.  Five stars because she is, was Norma Shearer, and she is magnificent in the film.  She is spot on all through the film, and the voice is as magnificent as always, she is as free and easy going as when she was twenty.  And as al things rare and unique, she earned her place in Hollywood myth.  For a reason God and Norma only know, she devoted herself to the ''idea'' of Norma Shearer, so much so, that when offered the part of ''Mrs Miniver"" in 1942 by M.G.M.  she turned the role down, feeling that ''my fans won't accept me as a mother of a grown son''.  Greer Garson won an Oscar for her performance in the role, and soon married the actor that played her son in the movie, Richard Ney.  Jerry Wald offered Norma the role of Charlotte Vale in the immortal, ''Now Voyager''.  I believe Norma would have made an exquisite portrayal of the character Charlotte Vale.  Her contract with M.G.M. expired, there was no reason for Norma to have been afraid of this role.  I adore Bette Davis in the movie, but Norma was of the ''age'' and had the range, and it seems she had also suffered some of life's bitter along with the sweet.  Instead Norma finished her career with the George Cukor directed, ''Her Cardboard Lover''.  Norma later admitted:  ''no one but myself did me in''.  But being kind to the lady, Cukor knew better, and he had to know what was happening to Norma.  Cukor directed more actresses to their professional ends than I can think of.  Garbo, Crawford, Shearer, Garland, Monroe, just a sample.  He didn't help men much either, he just helped himself.

There is an available treasure of Norma Shearer movies awaiting discovery.  Norma is one of the most remarkable jewels in that treasure at the end of the rainbow.",1450483200,,5524,4.485915492957746

8357640,4,B0029719HK,"While this is not a laugh out load type comedy, Douglas and Shearer make a nice romantic pair in their roles as slumming ex-royalty.  The humor is mostly the subtle changes brought about by consequence of their relationship and then some great short turns put in by Marjorie Main and Alan Mowbray.  Gail Patrick and Lee Bowman occupy their usual roles as ""the other man/woman"" but both carry their parts well and get plenty of screen time if you are a fan of either.  If you like Melvyn Douglas at all for his typical dry sophisticated roles, this one fits right in line with others of his best (i.e. Theodora Goes Wild or That Uncertain Feeling).  Shearer is at the end of her career and not quite the glamour queen, but holds up well in the role of the tarnished princess.",1377820800,2,774,4.468085106382978
