4213006,5,B003W5C0VW,"As of today this dvd is still not released, but I know it like the back of my hand already thanks to the stellar bootleg copy I have owned for years. I can only assume this new one will be even better quality. What would be nice is if they would offer up some ""bonus tracks"" as well. I doubt this will happen however, as Mick Jagger is one who's never cared too much about the past. The Stones filmed 4 concerts for this movie .... two in Ft. Worth and two in Houston in the summer of 1972. (Note that Jagger sports 4 different outfits during the course of the Ladies & Gentlemen film) Songs performed in those 4 shows but not seen in the original film were ""Rocks Off,"" ""Sweet Black Angel,"" and Chuck Berry's ""Don't Lie To Me."" It would be great to give the fans what they really want, if you're listening Mick! Otherwise, this film does indeed catch the Stones in their absolute prime. Mick Taylor rules ... Ronnie would if he could. 99% of the shots are extreme close-ups of the band (mostly Jagger) and it would have been nice to have a few more long shots of the stage and the venue itself, but hey ... You Can't Always Get What You Want.",1283817600,8,1143,4.2

This is right exactly WHERE Rock & Roll PEAKED: the wave crested and broke right here.  Once you get this, compare it that ""Shine A Light"" POS, you'll see what I mean.  Ron Wood is NOT Mick Taylor (check out the second guitar solo on ""Love In Vain""), and c leavell AIN'T Ian Stewart or Nicky Hopkins.  There is no better ANYWHERE!

4213009,5,B003W5C0VW,"Pure dirty Exile-era Stones.  Serious about the music.  If you need to learn what all the fuss is about and have only witnessed later concert films (the inferior ""We're the Stones You Should Love Us Just Because"" vibe of ""Let's Spend the Night Together""), this document sets the record straight.

The Stones are working hard at this show, looking as if they have something to prove.  And prove it they do.  It's 1972 and there is still an element of danger in the air for this band. They're deadly serious and are leaning into these numbers.  Mick Taylor--the sequel to Brian Jones and the prequel to Ron Wood--stands stock still and delivers those chilling licks that made Exile on Main Street legendary.  Heck, even good ole honorary Stone Nicky Hopkins is on board for some rollicking piano fills.

This show just builds and builds.  By the time they crash head on into Midnight Rambler you feel as if there's no other rock 'n' roll band.

And there IS no other rock 'n' roll band.  THIS is the Stones.  You SHOULD love them. Because of THIS.",1283126400,179,1045,4.589189189189189

4213012,5,B003W5C0VW,"I am a follower of the Stones since 1964.  I was 9 years old.  Eight years later, my older brother buys tickets for the Houston 4 pm show.  It would be my first concert.  Five of the fifteen songs in the movie are from this performance.  The Stones had played 2 shows in Fort Worth on Saturday, June 24, 1972, and they played 2 shows the next day at the University of Houston.  All songs are from Beggars Banquet through Exile on Main St., with Bye Bye Johnny thrown in.  Hopefully, they have improved the video for this great movie (the soundtrack has survived in good shape as heard through various bootlegs).  Keith's vocals for Happy were overdubbed & a mess was made of it in the film.  A mystery, because there is a performance on youtube that is not overdubbed.  The vocals are ragged, but it's Keith so who cares?  No inflatable women or bridges to small stages, just a band who is focused on showing how good they really are.  Mick Taylor is a great guitarist and a highlight, but Keith's rhythm guitar work is amazing,  The rhythm section is playing hard,  with a horn section from Texas, the legendary Nicky Hopkins on piano, and the best front man in the business.  I even think it may be Ian Stuart at the piano during Brown Sugar.  Very few shots of the audience, the focus being on the band.  If at least one of these songs don't impress you, you are not a rock fan.  A must see.",1281571200,268,1394,4.316602316602316

It's the '72 stones - fresh off Sticky Fingers in '71 and Exile in '72 featuring Mick Taylor (on his last stones tour in peak form) dominating his lead on songs like Love in Vain (if you want a sneak peak, I believe it's on YouTube.

4213019,5,B003W5C0VW,"Most reviewers don't seem to realize that this 1972 concert was originally theatrically released in ""quadrophonic sound"" (similar to today's 4.0 surround) as was to be an alternative to going to a live Stones concert.  At the time, this was state-of-the-art sound and it really was the next best thing to seeing Keith and Mick live. Concert sound really wasn't all that good back then and this film doesn't really improve on the original mix the way the remastered live Beatles tracks do on the recent ""Eight Days a Week"" disc.  Also, the concert was originally filmed on 16mm stock, which limits the visual quality. However, it does give you a good sense of what going to a Stones concert was like in their heyday, fuzzy sound, dark lighting, and all!",1499472000,2,752,4.732824427480916

4213027,5,B003W5C0VW,"This concert footage documents the ""Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World"" at their absolute peak. The concert recording on this release is exceptional! According to Wikipedia, the sound was recorded on 32 distinct tracks and then mixed down to 4 channels to produce a concert-like experience, but with the acoustic clarity of a studio recording. It is one of the best live recordings I have every heard, and certainly the best from that era.

This footage demonstrates just how important Mick Taylor was to the sound of the Stones in the Sticky Fingers/Exile on Main street era, fantastic--his loss in '74 was huge. While I love ""Get your Ya-Yas Out"", this is even better. Mick is spot on, Keith is pounding away on his often-open-G tuned guitars. Charlie and Bill, hardly shown, do their usual good work. Sax and piano were great too, although not highlighted as much as I would have liked.

The filming techniques used were rather unique too, difficult to describe. The polar opposite of, for example, the River Plate video of ACDC concert. The audience is rarely seen, and then only fleetingly. The band, even Mick Jagger, are often shown only in the shadows. The overall effect is highly stylized, not a straight documentary approach. It works well.

The long, slow decline of the Rolling Stones as creators of new music started shortly after this recording. Never again would they achieve the brilliance that is heard on Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street. Mick Jagger had grown weary of Rock and Roll, Mick Taylor left and Keith seemed to run short of ways to milk the Chuck Berry heritage and the open G tuning of his guitars (not totally, e.g. Start Me Up, Doom and Gloom). There will never be better Rock and Roll than you can see/hear on this video. Highly recommended.",1483920000,2,1819,4.768253968253968
4213028,4,B003W5C0VW,"I guess at this point you might think that the Stones tried to roll along too long or that the original make-up of Brian Jones's vision of the band was really where they were at. This might be one of the best documents, however, of the Stones during the Mick Taylor years, and does well to show the Stones on the arena stage during the early 70s. The music is tight, leaning heavily on Exile on Main Street to establish their credibility ten years after Jones put together his vision of the band. The video suffers from a bit too much camera time on the lead singer rather than the band as a whole. I know that the singer thought he was the focus of the band, but at this point in time, the Stones were a band; it seems disingenuous to have such a prominent focus on just one member.",1482019200,,783,4.19205298013245

4213044,4,B003W5C0VW,"Some here make some (arguably) justifiable criticism of Taylor, while many more adore him, but I'll tell you this: both Brian Jones and Mick Taylor pushed the band in directions that they never could have gone in without them.

Brian was a pain in the ass much of the time, of course, but for all of his self-professed blues purism, it's ironic that his ability to play almost any instrument is what made the band utterly unique in those days. Say what you will about the ""classic lineup"" of the Stones, but the genius of stuff like ""Ruby Tuesday"" and ""She's a Rainbow"" only happened when Brian was around  and healthy enough to bother to come to work and hold onto whatever instrument he was playing.

Similarly, Mick Taylor also boldly pushed the band in his own way, and this PO'd Keith, who in truth, all but pushed him out of the group. So we should hardly be surprised that Mick T. was replaced by Ron Wood, who has always been little more than a yes-man with this band. These days, Ronnie is often so drunk he can hardly play, but as long as he's best buddies with Keith and never steps on his toes, no one seems to care that his contribution to the band is little more than simply to complement whatever Keith's playing.

Yes, that's why we should all miss Mick Taylor.",1460592000,,1277,4.421276595744681

4213047,4,B003W5C0VW,"At some point during the 1970's, music critics dubbed the Rolling Stones ""the world's greatest rock and roll band."" In 1972 (the year this was filmed), they certainly laid claim to that title and this concert film is exhibit A. This is the classic lineup of the band at the top of their form. And Mick Taylor is in no small part responsible for the band's accolades. From 1969-1974 Taylor's fluid guitar work graced such classic Stones' albums as LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS and arguably the best album they ever recorded EXILE ON MAIN ST.

EXILE was released in March of 1972 and the concert footage on this DVD is taken from four shows in Texas the following June. For a tour that for all intents and purposes was to promote their new album, it's a bit surprising that only four songs (""Happy,"" ""Tumbling Dice,"" ""Sweet Virginia"" and ""Rip This Joint"") are performed in concert. However, a fifth song (""Shake Your Hips"") is included as a bonus rehearsal track.

Here's what's on the DVD:

CONCERT FILM  (running time - 1:22:23)

Fifteen songs--all but two of them (""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and ""Bye Bye Johnny"") are from the Mick Taylor-era. Additional musicians include Bobby Keyes (saxophone), Jim Price (trumpet, trombone), Nicky Hopkins (piano) and Ian Stewart (listed in the credits as ""mystery piano""). [Note: Hopkins only appears on camera once when Mick Jagger introduces the band members; Stewart does not make an on-camera appearance.)

The sound is quite good; however, the picture quality is good at best. There is little interaction between band members, and Jagger dominates the film. Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman get very little exposure--certainly less than Bobby Keyes.

BONUS MATERIAL

Tour Rehearsal:  This includes three complete runthroughs of songs. Only one of these songs is performed in concert.

""Shake Your Hips"" (3:47)
""Tumbling Dice"" (4:18)
""Bluesberry Jam"" (3:29) an instrumental blues jam featuring Keith Richards on lead guitar and Ian Stewart on piano.

Interviews

BBC ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" interview with Mick Jagger (5:44, recorded prior to the release of EXILE)
2010 interview with Mick Jagger exclusively for this DVD release (10:20)

4213050,4,B003W5C0VW,"I've always wanted to see the Stones doing ""Exile on Main St."" material with Mick Taylor, and I just found out about this film after reading Keith's autobiography.  I've just watched ""Shine a Light"" recently, too, and it is interesting to compare the two.  For example, Keith only plays rhythm guitar through the entire show with Mick Taylor, except for ""Bye Bye Johnny"" (nobody does Chuck better than KR, c'mon), but hell, Taylor is kicking ass all the way through even though his stage presence is nil since he just stands there looking at his hands.  Still, Ronnie Wood cannot hold a candle to Taylor, even though I will admit his pedal steel on ""Faraway Eyes"" was nice on ""Shine A Light"".

The Stones take a while to get moving in this film; maybe Keith didn't get some good smack that day.  The first two songs are pretty lack luster, and I actually felt sorry for Jagger and Charlie having to put out all the energy.  But right near the end of ""Gimme Shelter,"" they take off, and you can actually see Charlie smile when he finally feels the groove get locked down at last.  After that, the show progressively builds in power and groove.  I was especially glad that they included ""Happy"" because I was curious to see what it would sound like with Charlie playing the drums (Jimmy Miller played drums on the ""Exile"" version).  All the ""Exile"" songs are worth the price of admission here, even if the sound and lighting could be better, of course.

I was too young to see the Stones on the Exile tour, but I did get to see them in 1978 at the New Orleans Superdome on the ""Some Girls"" tour.  I hate to say it, but opening band Van Halen kicked the Stones' asses right out the damn door, and you best believe David Lee Roth was getting all the hottest groupies that night, and Jagger probably had to go back to the hotel with the leftovers.  But a few years earlier, there weren't too many bands that could touch the Rolling Stones, and this film is an important document to give weight to that opinion.",1449964800,,2005,4.448087431693989

I disagree a little with those saying Mick Taylor was the star performer.....although I love his time in the band and those albums were the groups real masterpieces, I feel that at times, live, he's sort of playing OVER the band rather than WITH them.  The interplay between Keef & Ronnie is far more interesting and satisfying to me than the more obvious rhythm / lead split.

These shows are from 4 they did in Texas (Dallas I think) and like the night I saw them they're right on the money big time and truly live up to being ""The world's greatest rock and roll band"". I remember when the movie came out in late '74 and quickly disappeared. Lucky for all Stones fans it is now available on DVD and even if you're just a casual fan of the band THIS IS THE ONE STONES ITEM TO OWN!!! The Mick Taylor incarnation of the band was my very favorite and Mick shines here playing killer blues and rock and roll riffs throughout the show and looking like an angel in a sea of devils. When I saw them during this tour in NYC the encore consited of opening act Stevie Wonder joining the band for a medly of ""Uptight/Satisfaction"". I don't know if they did that on these particular shows, but sadly that classic encore is not included on this DVD, but fret not because that does not marr the performance at all. It's a superduper KILLER DILLER!!! BUY THIS DVD and PLAY IT LOUD!!! When the show is over and Mick humbly says ""Thank you very much. Goodnight.""

4213098,3,B003W5C0VW,"So I wake up and it's, what, 1972 already? I mean, really. You could've flown me higher than First Class from Ocho Rios all the way to a secret Swiss clinic in the middle of the night, baby, and it still wouldn't have prepared me for THIS.

Think about it:  I escape Merry Very Olde by the skin of what's left of my teeth and end up making records in some Nazi-forsaken French basement. There's Mick Taylor (sometimes), there's that other Mick (rarely), and of course there's Charlie and even Gram Parsons whenever my five strings need a chorus. The old lady's got the kid asleep upstairs, I'm assuming, and downstairs it's as hot as an ungrounded amp in Sacramento. Nevertheless, the Stones manage to crank out a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/double-album/dp/B0039TD826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">double album</a>'s worth of material in record time, pun possibly intended, and then it's time to return to America - the land of NOTHING'S for free - and mount The Tour To Top All Goddamn Tours. Or so we thought.

""Ladies and gentlemen, The Rolling Stones!"" went the announcement for the next two months, seven weeks, and sixteen songs in thirty-one cities over fifty-one shows. Not to mention, while we're doing numbers here, one hundred and thirty-one arrests - including my own on of all places Rhode Island, perhaps not entirely coincidentally - and probably a hundred Altamont's worth of injuries and OD's to top it all.

Nevertheless, that tour's been called everything from ""part of rock and roll legend"" to ""one of the benchmarks of an era,"" in the words of noted rock scribe Dave Marsh. Well, I do beg to differ, dear Dave. Unless you consider Dick Cavett cornering Bill Wyman for a televised toke in the bowels of Madison Square Garden something of a benchmark. Or Truman Capote sucking up to all the celebrity willy he could. On OUR bill. Or Jagger's bill, to be truthful.

Now I must regretfully admit to missing many of no-longer-little Stevie Wonder's opening sets during this excursion, as the plane we rented from Bobby Sherman really was the ONLY way to see the USA that summer. From 30,000 feet, that is. And with all the ""tea"" and sympathy one could inhumanely hold. But after the whole damn thing was over, we didn't even get a lousy album out of it, thank you very much again Mr. Allen Klein. Oh, there were lots of books and magazine articles of course, and Jann Wenner's been going out to dinner on our fabulous exploits that year ever since. But save for Robert Frank's ""unauthorized""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/lump-of-underexposed-tripe/dp/B0019Q6RLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">lump of underexposed tripe</a>, it didn't look like we were going to be able to squeeze even a movie from the entire four-ring circus.

Never underestimate the money-hustling instincts of one Michael Phillip Jagger, however. When push came to financial shove - meaning after our last&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/album-at-the-time/dp/B001WCN232/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">album at the time</a>&nbsp;sold about as hotly as Bibles outside the Chicken Ranch - he managed to get the '72 tour footage finally assembled and into theatres. But, being Mick, not just any Saturday afternoon matinee, no sir. ""Ladies & Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones,"" as he titled this cinematic spectacular, was blown up from 16-mil and mixed into then-fashionable (for about a week or two) four-channel surround quadraphonic sound. To be exclusively shown ONLY in theatres that could handle it all, mind you.

Of course, in the mid-Seventies few could, so we were forced to ""four-wall,"" as in rent at our own expense that is, movie houses into which we had to import specially designed concert-size sound systems (and audio engineers who knew how to operate the stuff) in order to screen the bugger ...and schlep the bloody gear and crew all 'round the States on 14-footer flatbed trucks to boot. Jesus. We should've just gone back out on the road ourselves. Would have been a lot easier. And we would have actually seen some coin from it.

""It's the next best thing to seeing The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band in Concert!"" screamed the ads. ""Get this fruckin' movie OUT OF HERE,"" screamed the various promoters brave, or should I say foolish enough to mount this entire charade.

Dear, dear Mick. He's still trying to make movies. But at least whenever he tries to make Rolling Stones movies, we now insist on real equipment, adequate staging and, most importantly, real directors. Marty Scorsese did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/our-last-concert-film/dp/B00AEBB928/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">our last concert film</a>. I even got to give Bill Clinton's mother-in-law a smack on the great behind in that one. Or was it his wife? Same difference, chum.

So. Cut to 2010. And ""Ladies & Gentlemen"" lives again, in all of its Quadra-Sound - or 5.1 as it's called nowadays - glory on DVD and Blu-ray ...and probably even vinyl if they can figure out a way. There's Mick Taylor playing an extremely mean lean ""Love In Vain."" There's Charlie, being as good as it always gets. And there's Mick Jagger jumping from white jumpsuits into purple (continuity, anyone?!) while jumping all over stages which in 1972 seemed enormous, but today would scarcely even hold the man's traveling wardrobe bunker.

And there's NOT Bill Wyman. Ruthlessly cropped clean out of all the front cover packaging, justice duly, if belatedly served. We airbrush him out of album covers and reunion [sic!] concerts nowadays too. So why not DVD covers?

Plus, there's yours quite truly, friends. Belting out ""Happy"" as if I actually were, and giving ol' Brenda a run for his Binaca - or should I say Bianca - as we extremely-close duet to scrape the Bakersfield right off of ""Sweet Virginia."" Classic, karmic entertainment for all of you who, this century, prefer to get your kicks in front of the flat screen as opposed to the L.A. Forum.

This disc's even got some pretty fascinating bonus footage as well. Like three tour rehearsal clips which appear to have been filmed in, or at least for, Germany. I can't really recall ...and you'll see why when you see how I appear in these frames. And naturally Your Majesty fills the past and present interview segments as well, prattling on about that pathetic Chuck Berry wannabe Marc Bolan in a 1972 ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" chin wag, then giving his meal ticket some back-handed props during a brand new chat, I do believe:

Says he's now ""quite impressed"" with the film, and with the '72-model Stones in general, it seems. We were ""very lackadaisical, very sloppy on stage"" back then, he dares to claim ON CAMERA today. Oh, really? Speak for yourself, darling.

Or better still, see for yourselves, everyone else out there, and buy ""Ladies & Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones"" for your very own.

4213115,4,B003W5C0VW,"For years the only Rolling Stones concert videos available were the ones from the Ron Wood era of the 80's and 90's. This 1972 concert film offers Stones fans a long awaited look at the band rocking the stage in their mighty prime when both Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor were still in the group. Filmed during the Exile on Main Street tour in Texas in 1972, this movie shows the band at the peak of their performing powers with a great set list that covers most of the classic Stones hits of the late 60's and early 70's. The only real problem with this movie, as others have mentioned, is the poor lighting and camera angles that somewhat kills the mood and atmosphere of the band's performance. Gimme Shelter and Midnight Rambler in particular are filmed almost completely in the dark. This is a film that would look better in a movie theater than a TV screen in your living room.

The movie begins with a nice, suspenseful opening sequence. The screen is black as we hear people behind the scenes getting ready for the Stones to take the stage while the flickering of stage lights begin to appear as the moment draws near. The band is introduced by the announcer as they take the stage and launch into Brown Sugar. Jagger, Richards, and Charlie Watts are all in fighting form here, but Wyman and Taylor look bored to death the entire performance with zero stage presence. As others have said, Taylor is a fine blues-rock guitarist who delivers plenty of red hot solos throughout, but he is so stiff and motionless on stage that he doesn't appear to be enjoying himself at all. The same can be said for Wyman. It's not hard to see how both men eventually left the band after seeing the total lack of enthusiasm displayed here.

The highlight of the film for me is the final four tunes starting with Chuck Berry's Bye Bye Johnny. The stage lights finally come on during the closing tunes and the camera finally gets a few shots of the audience while the Stones deliver a final blast of high-energy rock n' roll to close out the concert. If the entire concert had been filmed with the better lighting shown at the end, this would have been a great concert film. Despite the bad early 70's lighting and camera work, the sound is good and this is likely the only concert footage of the Mick Taylor era that will ever be issued. If you love the Stones or classic rock, this is a worthy DVD for your collection, but don't be expecting the top-notch video and sound quality of today's standards.",1362441600,,2487,4.487858719646799

4213120,5,B003W5C0VW,"I am the Stones Authority. I remember seeing this as a midnight movie in 1978. Well, really, I didn't remember much, but then the DVD. Oh yeah. When watching this thing people need to keep in mind that it is 1972. Concerts and big time rock and roll were still evolving - the modest staging is really quite remarkable to behold - even for a major act like the Rolling Stones. As well, the venues from which these performances were pulled to make the full length DVD ""concert"" were quite modest as well. They played two shows in Fort Worth and they played two shows in Houston at Hofheinz Pavillion. Now, I don't know much about the venue in Fort Worth, but I can tell you that Hofheinz is a quite small basketball arena on the University of Houston that might seat four thousand. Today it is a dark and dank dump. Whenever I am there I can't help but think - this is where the Stones played? Doesn't seem possible. It wasn't like they were just breaking out and needed the gig! Now, keeping all this in mind, keep also in mind the limitations of the technology of the day - particularly live concert production, both for recording the live music and filming it. Can't be compared with today. Clearly there is no real lighting director on this thing - or it would have never been lit like this for film. There is probably no real director - or the camera angles and shot selections would have been a bit different for sure, but all that aside and looking past all that - as you should - what this film captures is quite amazing. A very tuned up and hungry Rolling Stones in a fairly raw and intimate setting - no frills staging, just the band - blowing it out. This is a time capsule - given that it is 40 years ago. 40 flipping years ago. The Rolling Stones are very good. And this is as good as anything for proof of how good a guitar player Keith is, but, of course, it is also a record of just how amazing the very young Mick Taylor is. And Jagger is no slouch either. The energy is full blast start to finish. Now, they could control that because they were picking and choosing between four shows worth of performances, but still... I can't play this DVD enough. ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Bitch"" open the ""show"" - it is a hell of a one two punch. The version of ""Dead Flowers"" is just terrific. ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Love In Vain"" back to back are wonderful. Taylor's slide on ""Vain"" is inspired and the version from the film ""Gimme Shelter"" has nothing on this one. But perhaps the absolute dynamite blow you away track - and not a particular favorite of mine, but here it just sets everything on fire - is this version of ""All Down the Line"". I've never heard it that good. And it just maybe be the best single live performance of a song captured of the Stones. I mean, it is that good. Jaw dropping good. Bill is just pumping the locomotive - that bass line is just throbbing and there are a couple of down the line shots where you pretty much see the whole band and it is like you are watching one whole organism moving to the groove. It's mind blowing. Taylor smokes it too. It is just nuts. I really could go on and on about this DVD and every track - including Keith's great guitar work on ""Bye Bye Johnny"" - even though the camera guys miss a lot of it, you hear it baby. And then the dual closers ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" just leave you wanting more. Oh, to have been there - in that little dump of an arena! After you watch this DVD - and see through the years and technological limitations - there is no band today that carries that kind of energy into a show today, leaves it all out on the stage like they do for these shows. The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. For a reason.",1357257600,,3716,4.25

This is straight out awesome rock film.  Mick Jagger kicks ass and features the musical stylings of Keith, Charlie, Bill and Mick Taylor - who, by the way plays the most amazing solo on Love in Vain.  It's not to be missed.
Favorite song on this Blu-Ray:  Rip This Joint.",1351987200,2,481,4.252747252747253
4213125,4,B003W5C0VW,"The film is a mix of good and bad.  The Stones are great, at the top of their game, which more than makes up for the horrible directing.

The film starts with a great extended lead up to the Stones coming on stage.  Your anticipation builds until you hear the announcer say, ""Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones"".  You hear the crowd roar and you feel your hair stand on end.  Suddenly a shot of Charlie on the drums.  Then Keith ambles out in his typical style, followed by Mick Jagger bounding on to the stage.  More exciting anticipation, waiting for the band to start. These were the days before everything was timed and computerized and it took a minute or two for the band to get started once they got on stage.  Jagger walks back and forth a bit then mumbles into the microphone, something like, ""Let's go, Keith"".  Then Keith rips into ""Brown Sugar"", the crowd roars and you can just feel the excitement from the crowd.  You want to stand up and cheer watching it in your living room!  That lasts all of a fraction of the opening riff before the crowd sound is completely mixed out of the sound.  That's kind of it for the rest of the film.  No crowd.  I mean, this is a concert film.  Shouldn't we have some sense of the crowd?

What follows is maybe the worst directed rock concert film of all time.  The camera shots are way too limited and usually too close up.  The sense of the size of the concert and event is lost in the viewing.  One great example -- for the song, ""Happy"", Keith sings lead, but the camera focuses on Mick Jagger, who is standing with his back to the audience waiting for Keith to sing.  The stage light is also on Mick as he frantically points toward Keith, signaling, ""Over there!  I'm not singing this one, Keith is!""

However, the Stones sound fantastic and are at their live concert peak.  Mick Taylor is a master on guitar throughout.  The rhythm section of the band, Keith, Bill and Charlie drive the songs with a steady intensity.  Funny for those who know Keith only from his image as a mumbling, incoherent smack-addict, it is stunning to watch him in this film.  Keith is a study in concentration during the performances.  He frequently turns back toward Charlie, focusing on keeping the rhythm of each song on track.  Great shot of Keith in the opening song, ""Brown Sugar"" as he plays in the background and grooves and lip syncs along with Mick.  Keith has rehearsed a great band for this tour and he is enjoying the product of his hard work.

""All Down the Line"" is my favorite performance of the film.  The band hits such a groove that you even catch the stoic Mick Taylor bopping his head a bit.  And no one seems to be enjoying the performance more than Mick Jagger himself, who at the end of the song appears to be dancing more to entertain himself than to please the crowd.  Other highlights of the show for me were ""Brown Sugar"" and any song with Mick and Keith together at the microphone (""Happy"", ""Dead Flowers"").

A must-have for Stones fans.  Yes, the film has its flaws, but no one is going to time travel back to 1972 and film us a better Stones concert.",1351555200,2,3117,4.399299474605955
4213126,2,B003W5C0VW,"I anticipated a great concert with Mick Taylor's skills being a big part of that anticipation. It was OK musically, but very poorly videotaped. The only focus was on Mick Jagger, in all his glory. I hard every saw another band member in the video at all!  Seriously, It also had an ""old"" look to it.  I believe the film's quality was the main reason why it was shelved until now. I was really disappointed.  Mick even comments at the end, explaining how the filming ""back then"" left alot do be desired.(?)  I wish I knew that before I bought it.",1349827200,2,545,4.366336633663367

Notice how the audience is rarely shown; When this movie originally came out in the theaters in the mid 70s, much hype was made that it was filmed in a way that would make you think YOU are the original audience witnessing the concert (Hence the lack of audience shots that would spoil this illusion).  Too Bad they went that direction in the editing room. It is always exciting to see Mick J. interact with the crowd, but there's NONE of that on display here.",1347062400,2,616,4.5

Everything the band plays (excepting one cover song) is from Let it Bleed, Beggars, Sticky, or Exile.  Mick Taylor, Nickey Hopkins and Bobby Keys are equal players with the core of Mick, Keith, Bill and Charlie (even Ian S. makes a brief piano appearance).

This is the Rolling Stones at their absolute peak (among many great periods). Don't worry about the lack of completely perfect technical quality, this is what cinema verite aspires to be.

There are virtually no full-group shots, views of the audience, or good visuals of the incomparable Charlie Watts. However, Mick Jagger does an interview in which he explains that that is what they had to work with in those days. The quality of the camera work is very good, just limited in its variety.

4213136,5,B003W5C0VW,"There are two kinds of Rolling Stones fans.

The first kind was alive and rocking when the band delivered the one-two gut punch of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sticky-Fingers/dp/B001WCN23W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sticky Fingers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exile-on-Main-Street/dp/B0039TD7RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exile on Main Street</a>&nbsp;(1971 and 1972, respectively). The Beatles had called it a day...no more yearly ""events"" like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band-Remastered/dp/B0025KVLTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt.

If the Stones were in fact ""the greatest rock & roll band in the world,"" as is proclaimed on the opening of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Yer-Ya-Ya-s-Out/dp/B00006AW2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!</a>, the playing field was a lot less crowded in 71-72. Their major competition came in the form of The Who (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Next-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00008LOS1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Next (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;in 1971 and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quadrophenia/dp/B005DMNS4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quadrophenia</a>&nbsp;in 1973). But in terms of straight-ahead, Chuck Berry-style, riff-driven, testosterone-driven rock and roll, The Stones WERE the greatest, especially during Mick Taylor's tenure. In order to be the ""first kind of"" Stones fan, you had to be there as it unfolded. You had to walk into your local ""record Store"" and peel the cellophane off of your copy of ""Sticky Fingers"" and ""Exile"" and place it on your turntable and lower the tonearm and hear the crackle of needle hitting vinyl and hear the opening ""fire in the hole"" blasts of ""Sticky Fingers"" or ""Rocks Off"" for the FIRST time. I was / am ""that kind of Stones fan""...I was there.

The second kind heard the music later, perhapes decades later, and may have discovered it through the many bands who were formed and influenced by being ""the first kind of"" Stones fan. You've probably heard Roger (The Byrds) McGuinn's anecdote about seeing The Beatles'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Hard-Day-s-Night/dp/B004U7MQXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Hard Day's Night</a>&nbsp;and immediately deciding that he needed to form a band. He wasn't alone. There were many, back in the day, who heard Mick Taylor and Keith Richards send out salvo after salvo of deadly blues and R&B flavored licks while Jagger prowled the stage and Watts and Wyman soldiered on, expressionless, and thought ""THIS is my sandbox. THIS is where I need to be playing.""

This DVD, despite any technical imperfections of the era, captures the Sones when they were at their undeniable peak. In the accompanying booklet, Jagger mentions the fact that the Stones could have off nights and be sloppy:

""It's a full-on performance and energy levels are really high...Everyone's very together and on, you know. I can remember the Rolling Stones being, sometimes, very lackadaisical. a very sloppy band on stage, at this period. But that was obviously not the case on this day.""

This was the Exile On Main Street tour. Just as Ron Wood was essentially a ""guest"" on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-and-Blue/dp/B001WCN23M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black and Blue</a>&nbsp;and went full throttle on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Girls-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B005N95JA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Girls: Deluxe Edition</a>, Taylor did the same on ""Sticky Fingers.""

It's a sheer joy watching Jagger do his best rooster strut as Keef rips into ""Happy"" like a pit bull tearing into a pork chop. Jagger takes his time with the ""tease"" section of ""Midnight Rambler"" (""Oh NO, baby...you can't DO that, baby...), before blood-red stage lights bathe him in his white jumpsuit howling ""Waaaal, you HEARD about the BAW-stunnn..."" Taylor and Richards lock horns behind him, spewing out raw, sustained blues licks while Wyman and Watts hold the bottom firm and the entire band erupts in lock-step precision.

THIS is rock and roll. The hype about the Rolling Stones? There IS no hype, just the music. The same as the Beatles. It wasn't great because your mom and dad liked it. It was great because it was great, and it still is. For decades later, this music on this DVD will show you no mercy.

4213138,5,B003W5C0VW,"The rolling Stones at their absolute live peak here in 1972. Playing with so much energy that they can barely contain themselves. On this tour, and in this particular show they got down what they started back in the 1969 tour when Mick Tayler replaced Brian Jones as the 2nd guitarist. And that was to play pure high energy,sraight out ROCK AND ROLL,like Chuck Berry on Steroids.
  They only went down hill from here,especially live. This is the stuff,the reason they were called ""The Worlds Greatest Rock and Roll Band.""
  They played live for another 35yrs since this show, and were filmed on many tours, and you can see as the years and tours go by how the pure essence of the Rolling Stones music took a back seat to larger stages,less real playing by the group, and more and more backround singers and musicians,clogging up the stage and sound.you can actually see this progressivly happening from tour to tour,year to year.
  So what are the Stones? The Greatest rock and roll band in the world.(FROM 1963 to 1972. And thank God for Video tape.
  Mick Tayler and Keith play their asses off here. Charlie Watts never drummed better. Every single song is played to the max with so much energy that it seems like its got to fall apart. But it never does.

Can't recall if there was a sign next to it which read ""sacred cow"", or if that was simply my own conclusion...Anyway, I actually REELED when leaving the theater, the whole experience hit me that hard; over the years if you were lucky you could catch it @ a University showing or @ one of those great ""alternative"" second run movie houses. GREAT hard-hitting rock n'roll, mellow times: a communal joint would usually work its way down down the row of seats, total strangers united in their appreciation of the world's greatest rock n'roll band.

Bobby Keys in full blow, Keith with shawl in Brown Sugar, fast cuting on band but the camera really lingers on the dynamic Mick Jagger. ""Gimme Shelter"" is flatish, Mick Taylor wailing eventually. Where's Merry Clayton? ""Broken Fowers"" is Mick and Keith at the same mic, Keith with dyed patches in his hair. Great Mick Taylor solo. Call from the audience to play ""Sweet Virginia"" (they would comply later in the evening). They play ""Happy"", it gets huge applause. Why? Audience loves songs from the critically unpopular new release, ""Exile on Main Street"", or would they simply have been anxious for something new? ""Sorry you didnt' get to see Stevie Wonder, they must've overslept."" Tumblin' Dice' sounds empty without the background singers. Mick whispering, ""We're gonna do a little tune up, can you hear us in the back?"" Mick's right wrist, nice bracelet. Love In Vain, Mick Taylor's great slide guitars. Dumb cameraman angle with Bill's cable stretched across it is all wrong. Mick Taylor's stunning solo. ""We're gonna play a little acoustic guitar. Why aren't you in church anyway? ""Sweet Virginia"" has two acoustic guitars with Mick on harmonica. Calls out Bobby Keys, fixes mic for him. Keith's vocals, ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" showing Keith riffing. Funky, big Down The Line, sounds simplistic and bombastic. Mick Taylor's slide.  Bill Wyman statuesque, song gains bluster, Mick goin' nuts. Swigs Jack Daniels (or is it tea?). Nice Mick harmonica work. Mick's jumpsuit pajamas with red sash, Mick howling onstage. All in moody/creepy red lights. Charlie's good tonight. Over 10 minutes. ""Bye Bye Johnny"", Chuck Berry song. Very good funk/punk blues. Mick does onstage yoga, doing the upside down thing, then the crossed-legs thing. ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and good shots of Keith playing towards Charlie. Keith really cuts loose on last two classic tracks, ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Street Fighting Man"". Mick throws rose petals into audience and onto Charlie, who's wearing a nutty rhumba shirt (hey, that's nothing - check out Mick's satin jumpsuits). There's a rain of sparks and the crowd cheers. Indian rose petal blessing, playing Cat Stevens on PA after, no encore. Thanked John and Yoko and Cat Stevens and the Who in the credits.

In the bonus material, you get to see a cool ""Hip Shake"", with Keith singing along (as he often does), with him playing lead guitar. ""Tumbin' Dice"", no Keith backups, though. Bottle of Jack available, plus shot glasses, on full display. Keith and Charlie jam. ""Bluesberry Jam"" is Mick-less. There's an interview with Mick on the Old Grey Whistle Test where he talks about the loose recording process, praises the collaborative process John and Paul had writing as a band (ironic?). No place in the UK has the energy that Madison Square Gardens has, although it is a good place to base yourself in - better than France. Mark Bolan is good, better even when he plays acoustic (is this a backhanded compliment?). Mick mentions maybe doing things outside of the Stones. Charlie's rhumba shirt is from Western Costumes in LA, the band raided it for costumes and satin, anything. Mick goes on to talk about clothes, gold belts, and the beginning of glam. ""Bye Bye Johnny"" was super-fast, mad tempo, buildup to end, leads up to ""Rip This Joint."" ""Rocks Off"" was in the set, but not in movie, Mick and guitar were both off tune. Shot for cinema, not TV or home viewing. Film styles different, static process, people wanter and out of frame, no attempt at clothing continuity either.

However after watching ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" I was totally over the top on how great the quality of not only the footage but how great the sound was. The Stones were pioneers of great sound and lighting since Get Yer Ya Ya's out! It was great to see the horn section included on this tour! My only gripe, hardly any footage of Bill Wyman! Sure, the guy hardly moved around on stage but, he was one hell of a bass player with him and Charlie (Watts) locked in as one kick ass rythem section!

This concert from the 1972 American tour, shows why the Stones were so hot back then.  Never mind Keith Richards derisive remarks on Mick Taylor's playing after he left, the Stones never did sound as good, post-Taylor.
  Gimme Shelter also is memorable for the excerpts of the Stones 1969 tour, and I am frustrated a full DVD has not been released of the Get Your Ya Ya's Out album (Madison Square Garden performance on that tour).  Ladies & Gentlemen is the only full concert of the Stones with Mick Taylor, and it's the Stones at their best, so don't miss it!",1312416000,,671,4.512396694214876
4213146,5,B003W5C0VW,"I was able to see the Stones about 10 years ago. They were awesome in concert! Great show! I wanted them to play a show in my living room but that was too expensive, so I starting looking for a Stones concert DVD.

A friend let me borrow the ""Four Flicks"" DVD, which basically mirrors what I saw in concert about 10 years ago. It is an excellent collection of concert footage. But, as great as Four Flicks is, I wanted to see what the Stones were like back in the day, in their ""prime"" (which is hard to define since they STILL put on awesome shows). So, I continued my search.

Then I found ""Ladies & Gentlemen... The Rolling Stones"", shot as a film in 1972 during the tour to promote ""Exile on Main Street"". I bought the DVD and just watch it last night. It was just what I wanted. It is a stripped-down, raunchy, version of the Stones. No backing vocals (other than Keith Richards sharing the microphone with Mick Jagger, which is pretty cool). No big stage or lighting. Just a solid performance from one of the greatest rock bands ever. The bonus interviews were cool as well (it contains a 2010 version of Mick Jagger talking about the film).

So, if you have seen the Stones lately and want that big stage, big lighting, more ""mature"" version of the Stones, buy ""Four Flicks"". If you want a solid, raunchy, ""younger"" version of the Stones, buy ""Ladies & Gentlemen... The Rolling Stones"".",1308268800,3,1393,4.43359375

4213153,5,B003W5C0VW,"I was fortunate enough to have been a 15-year old die hard fan living in Houston on 6-25-72, and was also lucky to have been listening to KLOL the afternoon they announced the tickets were going on sale the following morning. Camping out in line for that show was one of the smartest things I had yet done in my life. We got 4 for the evening show! I had never been that excited about anything up to that time.  And they did not disappoint.

When this film hit theaters in 74, I went to relive the moment 10 times.  Obviously I hated the film.... Right. Obviously this tour and this film really did capture the Stones when they were absolutely at the pinnacle of their craft. It is one of the few times in my life where the anticipation and hype before an event actually did not do the event itself justice (another example was the Texas-Southern Cal National Championship game in 2006). It was a truly life-changing transformative moment in my young life.

Now, all these years later they have finally remastered this film, and having seen it in Blu-Ray it was worth the wait, although this is still 1970's technology at heart.  But it is nevertheless heartening to know that what I thought as a kid was one of the most awesome things I have ever been witness to...really WAS that good.

All of the comments about Mick Taylor are spot on, his guitar work was nothing short of other-worldly. The band is TIGHT, the songs are from my favorite period in their creative history, and the film really does capture what it was really like to have been there. Jagger is also at the top of his game, and ushers in the era of glam rock with all the subtlety of a hurricane.

If you saw the 72 tour, don't miss this opportunity to jar your memory about what you actually saw and heard.  If you didn't see it in person, you will never ever get a better look at what these guys were like when they were the best rockers in the world. There simply was not even a close second--especially in person.  If you can't afford to buy it, rent it.  But if you miss it, you will be missing a picture window into a moment in time that truly was magical.  6 stars out of 5.",1302220800,2,2149,4.3076923076923075

4213160,5,B003W5C0VW,"Here's why I love this one: it's a great garage band at work.

If you see the Stones these days you'll never see some of the things caught on this film: Mick, ""Keith broke some strings,"" so we'll have to wait; tuning up before Midnight Rambler (notice how Mick keeps the audience under control by playing his harp, while also giving the guitars something to tune to). Keith goofing up the ending to Jumping Jack Flash. They're too polished for that kind of stuff now.

Midnight Rambler is worth the admission. Mick's harmonica playing is great and the band really cooks.

Bill Wyman is all over that bass and no one plays it like him. Yet he never moves. Neither does Mick Taylor, always just into his guitar, not watching the show it seems, but always adding so much. Love In Vain is all his, with Jagger perfect on the vocal.

Charlie knocks it out and as usual keeps them under control.
Keith: hard at work, no posing, none, usually eye to eye with Charlie most of the time.
The way Street Fighting Man is ramped up at the end is perfect.
The film, and the sound, is old school 70's so don't expect 36-track digital.  Prepare yourself for kind of a garage film for a garage band. Even with all those audio/video faults I still sometime watch certain songs just to concentrate on individual instruments, for instance, Bill Wyman's bass on most anything (Rip This Joint being one of his many stand outs).

This is what Scorsese should have seen before he made that crappy Imax film with 80 cameras and 70 sound technicians.
This film is basically shots of a garage band that really cooks. If any kids ask what's the deal with the Rolling Stones, I tell them to get this one.",1299369600,4,1675,4.475409836065574

The song selection for the film was very good, most having become concert staples all these years later. The Stones' performances on each and every song is great and their fans will be glad to have these peformances for posterity.

4213174,5,B003W5C0VW,"If there was ever any doubt in your mind that for a while (1969-1975) The Rolling Stones were truly ""the greatest rock and roll band in the world"", well here's your proof.  Sure, the quality of the video is far from 2011 state-of-the-art, and the sound quality might not be up to a purist audiophile's standards.. but hey - it's only rock and roll.  This video was complied from 4 different  (2 early/late) shows from Texas during a couple of days of 1972 Exile on Main Street tour.  The performances are just completely outstanding.  The band is  very tight, all the guitar parts are clear and distinct (in contrast to the most recent shows where Keith and Ronny's parts all sort of mush together), and the energy is very high.

The video runs an hour and 10 minutes but seems like longer because it starts out at warp 10 and then accelerates with no break.  All the songs (well, except for Bye Bye Johnny) are part of the Stones' greatest hits oeurvre and are sequenced pretty much as they might be played during a single Stones concert was/is (starts out with Brown Sugar, and ends with JJ Flash and Street Fighting Man.  The performances of Midnight Rambler and All Down the Line are especially good - the stuff of legend.  There are also three additional songs recorded and filmed during rehearsals for the tour, but they are nothing special (except that Keith plays almost all the leads - en though he is playing a 5 stringed Tele presumably still tuned to open G), plus a couple of interviews with Jagger, one from 1972 and one from 2010.  The Mick of 2010 is a bit scary, especially in contrast to the Mick of 1972,  and I'm sort of sorry I watched it.

When Mick Taylor joined the band in 1969, the Rolling Stones live shows changed dramatically.  Keith reverted back to playing mostly rhythm guitar (with some occasional leads) leaving Mick Taylor to play most of the leads and fills.  The combination worked spectacularly well in concert, as seen in this video.  Keith was able to play most of the time in (his relatively recent discovery of) open G, with 5 strings (removing the low E)  and capo'ed at the 4th fret to get these amazing chops - half rhythm-half lead, that provide the trademark Stones sound on songs like Brown Sugar, Midnight Rambler, Street Fighting Man, Jack Flash and many, many more.  On top of this, you get Mick Taylor, playing far and away the best lead guitar ever heard at any Rolling Stones concert,including some astounding slide guitar.  Why he left the band is considered a great mystery by most but it seems pretty clear to me that in the studio Keith was free to play both his trademark rhythm as well as overdubbing the lead (which he often did), leaving Mick Taylor as pretty much a 5th wheel.  It was only on stage that you could hear Taylor let loose and wow, is it ever hot as this video clearly demonstrates.

Mick, Keith, and Charlie are clearly having a great time, grinning, sweating and putting out.  Bill Wyman, as usual, appears to be on haldol to look at him, but sounds great.  And Mick Taylor - most of the time is standing stock still, completely expressionless, as his fingers fly over the fretboard and great lead riffs emerge.  He is also the only one that looks reasonably buff and healthy, even though in 1972 all the others would also still have been in their late 20's or early 30's.

I think I have all of the live (and studio) Rolling Stones that has been released on CD, DVD or (gasp) tape, but this is far and away the very best live Rolling Stones video that there is.  The sound is as good as that on ""Get Your Ya-Ya's Out"", previously the best live Stones available.

This may be too lo-fi for those who grew up on digital video and sound, but for old geezers like me, I barely noticed the flaws for the brilliance of the performances.  This  one is just too good to miss.

4213175,5,B003W5C0VW,"The Stones hit their zenith with Mick Taylor and this concert shows why.  This concert (1972) comes from the five year period (1969-1974) when he was their lead guitarist and they were on top of the charts with three #1 hits. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were writing great songs during this period.  Everybody was playing great, but Mick's guitar playing gave them an edge in live concerts and credibility as the self-proclaimed ""greatest rock and roll group of all time.""  However good they were, with Mick Taylor they were 50% better than the Brian Jones era or the Ron Wood period that came after! The concert footage is fine, and shouldn't be compared with current film techniques, and the soundtrack is equally good although Mick Taylor's playing is mixed down, giving it less prominence than in the bootlegs. The original recording needed a lot of restoration, according to Mick Jagger and was enhanced for this release.  Along with the concert, there is additional footage of the group practicing before the concert and two Mick Jagger interviews, one from 1981 and one from 2010 in which he describes, in the latter, how the group was then, and how things have changed in the interim. Jagger claimed he didn't know why the footage has been unreleased all these years but the real reason may be that Mick Taylor was in it. For a long time, Keith Richards held a grudge against Mick Taylor for leaving the Stones (see his autobiography, ""Life"" and it is still evident after all these years) that resulted in the suppression of some of their greatest work and a denial of performance royalties to Mick Taylor. After a short run, this movie was shelved for years after Mick T left the group, and available only as a bootleg movie.  The ""glimmer twins"" have admitted publicly that they are annoyed with fans who prefer the ""Mick Taylor era"" to the earlier era with Brian Jones or the more recent era with Ron Wood.  Maybe one day they will get over it and share the royalties of this release, and the Exile On Main St. re-release, and other recordings from this era with Mick Taylor.  I hope they do.  We can only hope they will play together again, one day, perhaps for a final tour. It would be an instant sell out.",1293667200,5,2223,4.638676844783715

4213178,4,B003W5C0VW,"This video, when showed in theaters, made little impact back in 1974. It is a product of their 1972 Exile on Main Street Tour. It includes quite a few songs from that double album--from ""Happy"" to ""Sweet Virginia,"" from ""Tumbling Dice"" to ""Dead Flowers."" Let's consider a sampling of the songs and performances. A couple observations: One, the Stones look so young here! Two, the music rocks.

The DVD starts out with a lively ""Brown Sugar."" Watts' driving drumming starts matters off, with chunky guitar playing by Keith Richards and young Mick Taylor.

""Happy"" is one of Keith's songs. He still had something of a singing voice here and this segment finds him singing with energy and enthusiasm, backed by Jagger. Tall and rangy Mick Taylor does some fine guitar work.

Then, to follow, ""Tumbling Dice,"" one of the better cuts from the ""Exile"" album. Guitars and rhythm section play off of one another well. Question: How come Charlie Watts doesn't get more face time on this DVD? The brass sound is fine with Bobby Keyes at work. Mick Taylor is not too animated in his movement, but his guitar sound is fine.

Robert Johnson's ""Love in Vain"" is a classic blues piece. Here, it is performed nicely, with a slow, bluesy sound. The Stones have normally played the blues with fine results. Here, that is indeed the case.

""Midnight Rambler"" is one of my favorite performance songs. The subject of the song is grisly--the Boston Strangler, and the song finishes with his own words used in one of the attacks. The long piece begins with Mick Jagger playing solid harmonica and takes off at a ""presto"" pace. The rhythm section (especially Watts) puts down a solid base supporting guitars and vocals. A dynamic version of the song. The extended guitar break is well played by Richards, and supported nicely by Taylor. Acceleration begins toward the climax of the song.

A nice cover of Chuck Berry's ""Bye, Bye Johnny"" is enjoyable to listen to

Then, the twin songs to end the concert footage--""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Street Fighting Man."" Richards' guitar licks start of ""Jumping Jack Flash"" well. A nice animated version. . . . With ""Street Fighting Man,"" drums and guitars propel this with considerable momentum.

Other songs: ""Bitch,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""Dead Flowers,"" ""Sweet Virginia,"" ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" ""All Down the Line,"" and ""Rip This Joint.""

A good sampling of the Rolling Stones in 1972. While there are occasional rough spots in the performance, for the most part it is an energetic performance, well played.",1293235200,8,2537,4.881395348837209

It has all the great songs of the era albiet, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street.

My only minor complaint is that they don't show the audience at all, the cameras just focus on the group that is it. Good show none the less for all fans",1293148800,,447,3.858695652173913

Perhaps not a significant moment in history but certainly an eye opener for the younger generation at the time.  For those of us who had other concerns - the Vietnam conflict, the nuclear arms race, and supporting a family to name a few - the 'over the top' descriptions of the impact of this Stone tour need to be taken with a grain of salt... The Stones learned from the tour and took a great deal of care to avoid the same mistakes again.",1292716800,,545,4.3861386138613865
4213183,3,B003W5C0VW,"Well, the good news is it's not the Stones fault. They played great. They rocked big time. This is the Mick Taylor era... the Stones absolute peak as a touring band in my humble opinion. Neither Brian Jones nor Ron Woods ever came close to matching the guitar mastery of Taylor. With the power of Wyman, Richards & Watts in their heyday behind him & Jagger out front, it's an untouchable combination.

Sadly, this show is plagued by low tech difficulties of the worst kind. The camera work is so poor it's literally unwatchable. It looks as if if it was filmed in a dark cave by a cameraman and/or director who had two 1970's porno films and not much else on their resume. But no matter, I figured, I don't need to actually see this... all I really want to do is hear this rare recording of the Stones live in all their 1970's glory. With the near magical digital restoration software available these days, I imagined the soundtrack would be all that & a bag of chips. Wrong. Either the recording quality was so atrocious that even the top sound wizards in the biz could not fix it (my first guess) or the  Stones or their record company put no $$$ into the restoration (unlikely). Either way, to my huge disappointment, this was a great performance that was convincingly NOT captured on film, tape or anything else. My biggest amazement is that this was ever green-lighted for release as a major motion picture at all, even in the early 70's.

Music and spectacle, optimally combined and without and before the often distracting stage gimmickry that would come in later years, delivers the primal intensity any music fan craves for.  Each number is a killer, and the show builds into a frenzied finale.  At first, the changing quality of the video, as well as the alternating outfits, might be disconcerting.  However, the show is sequenced seamlessly, giving the garments, at least, a colorful changing visual attractiveness.  The inferior quality of some of the video is undeniable, yet the power of the performance and the music triumph here.  I would have liked to have seem a couple of seconds more of a a clearly-shot Nicky Hopkins; otherwise, the ensemble players are well-represented.  Jagger is unbelievable--all four of him!

I am just so thrilled to have it.  It looks good enough; it sounds even better.  Mick Taylor is the creme-de-le-creme of 70s guitar players.  His finesse is amazing.  Being able to watch him pick through his lead riffs is such a treat that I can hardly believe my fortune. I found Jagger's performance to be a bit trite, almost silly, but the rest of the band is amazing.  It could have been longer.  It could have had more special features.  It could have been free.

The Stones were at their peak when Mick was in the band and this movie proves it.

As for the movie itself; it's poorly lit, shot from bad angles and grainy and blurry, especially during Gimme Shelter.
Also, it's cobbled together from multiple live shows so don't expect a modern concert ""look"" out of this Blu-ray.

Unfortunately, the audio wasn't remixed to showcase Mick Taylor's superior guitar skills and you'll need to tweak your
audio settings to pull Mick's stellar performance to the forefront. The ""LPCM"" audio setting worked best for me.
Visually, Mick Taylor does not jump around like Pete Townshend or Angus Young, his performance style is similar to Eric Clapton's.

Sure it is 70's shot footage, get over it.  It captures the band at what I believe was their creative best.  Watching Mick Taylor play is worth the price alone.  Hearing them play Dead Flowers, Sweet Virginia and All Down the Line are excellent renditions of songs they rarely cover now.  Throw in the classics like Gimme Shelter, Bitch, Tumbling Dice and You Can't Always Get What You Want, see the Stones at what I consider their height of playing live. For my money, I will take the late 60's and early 70's as the best period of music ever created and catching the Stones at this time is a must.

Despite the fact that he did not write any of their music, Taylor's exquisite guitar playing to complement Keith's great foundation playing, the musicianship took precedence over the theatrics and Jagger's ""one man show"" performance.of the latter Stones. The big gripe I have (I knew it would happen) is the lower volume of Taylor's guitar where you almost have to strain to hear all the details and nuances.

Back then, they were good enough to make two movies for the same tour.  Alas, the other one remains unreleased.  I never thought this would be officially released due to Mick Jagger's apparent indifference to the past, plus it makes the current band look and sound bad.

4213201,4,B003W5C0VW,"One of the nicest results of this year's ""Exilemania,"" this is the first time ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" has been released on DVD. This is an early 1970s concert film capturing the Rolling Stones as they promote their then-new double LP ""Exile on Main Street."" There are a lot of joys and surprises in this video, many of which include the relative youth and vitality of both Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Jagger sings like he really means it, and Richards seems thoroughly entranced by the rhythm riffs he's playing to goad the band on. The stage is too small to allow for the type of posturing and posing that the latter-day Stones are known for, the backup musicians are relatively few in number, and the setlist includes mainly songs from the Rolling Stones' last 3 LPs. Can you imagine such a thing today?

There's also a lot of space in these songs for then-lead guitarist Mick Taylor to really shine. Guitarists are going to want to watch his hands very closely, and pay close attention to his fluid blues-and-jazz based leads. This is a texture that's sorely missing from the modern Rolling Stones. It's also more than a little disconcerting to see how little fun Taylor seems to be having onstage; he looks almost like a bored sideman even during his glorious solos on ""Love in Vain!""

This is an early 1970s rock film and at times it shows. It definitely does not look like a contemporary 3-camera/direct-to-cable TV setup. It looks more like a documentary. Scenes are sometimes out of focus, and the director sometimes points the camera in exactly the opposite place you'd like it to be. (Thankfully we don't have the sort of extreme zooms that were also popular in concert films of the time.) The screen is oftentimes dark, because the stage lighting at the time was intentionally moody. I've seen better-looking concerts from this period, but I've also seen far, far worse and the picture quality is certainly acceptable. The sound, to my ears, is amazingly good.

Given that this was a theatrically-released concert film (and closely aligned to ""Exile on Main Street,"" the Rolling Stones give us more extras than we're used to on their concert discs. There are two interviews with Mick Jagger, which really don't reveal much about the film that we can't see with our own eyes. There are also some rehearsal scenes. There could have been a lot more included, though, and it's irritating that the Stones reserved a second disc full of extras to an expensive boxed set rather than just releasing a 2-DVD set. Such is life, I suppose.

If you count yourself as a true Rolling Stones fan from their early 1970s era, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD. It's well-worth seeing again and again.",1289001600,5,2702,4.73036093418259
4213202,4,B003W5C0VW,"Wanted to watch this to pay particular attention to Mick Taylor and there is a generous amount of footage trained on him.
While the film saturates the screen time with Jagger and Keith, the film makers do manage to swing over to Charlie and Bill from time to time as well as horn players Keys and Price. There is a 2 second shot of pianist Nicky Hopkins if you don't blink.
Which is a crime. But the film makers weren't thinking of Nicky back then.
Their focus was on Mick and Keith which is not illogical.
So, the amount of screen time given to Taylor is very much appreciated.
Observing his demeanor and stage presence is facinating.
Taylor and Richard split time between rhythm and lead guitar.
I love how after the first few high energy songs, Jagger introduces Love In Vain with ""Here's some blues for you"" and the atmosphere is de-escalated dramatically.
Taylor's guitar solo in Love in Vain is one of the highlights of the concert.
As a matter of fact, the performance of Love in Vain was outstanding while I would have to declare the highlight of the entire concert to be Midnight Rambler with its weaving textures and rhythm changes fast to slow to fast to slow and Jagger's expressive harp playing.
Toward the end of the show the Stones dust off Bye Bye Johnny which we learn later in the 2010 interview with Jagger they used to close their shows with in the '60's at the Crawdaddy club.
The bonus feature is a rehearsal filmed in Switzerland in what looks like a television studio, with just the five Stones in a close knit circle.
In a change of pace we get to watch Jagger minus all the over the top stage theatrics-standing with just a microphone in front of him.
This section of the disc I liked perhaps more than the main film because it was easier to hear the separation between Keith and Mick's guitars.
The two interviews, past and present, with Jagger are wonderful.

A bit disappointed that Keith is in the dark the whole song of ""Gimme Shelter."" I would have liked to have seen at least a few clear seconds of Keith playing guitar on each song from a straight-on view. I realize after having watched it, though, that this was the early days of big concerts so things like lighting and filming concerts hadn't come together yet.

4213206,2,B003W5C0VW,"The Stones seem to play every song too fast on this tape. They were in much better form on the later shows of this tour (see the Live in New York bootleg), and in much MUCH better form on the famous 1973 King Biscuit broadcast of the Bruxelles and Wembley (London) shows that were lamentably not caught on film. Recently Jagger has admitted to have wanted to release the 1973 live stuff, and that they still are thinking about it.

The highlight for me on this DVD is Mick Taylor's playing on Love in Vain. Mick is always spot-on, and when he left, they lost that great grinding guitar thing between him and Keith, the sound that for a large part defines The Stones and that they never really recovered with Woody.

Oh what a pity: there's so much live audio material from this period (the Stones performed a lot in 72 and 73) that shows a band playing so much better than on this Ladies and Gentlemen release...

So guys, if you like this Ladies and Gentlemen performance, you owe it to yourself to search out the bootlegs from this era!

4213207,2,B003W5C0VW,"After obtaining ""Live at the Max"" recently, I was really looking forward to this Blu-ray, however I'm disappointed.
This is one product that remastering does absolutely nothing for. The sound, as reported in prior reviews is flat with no dynamics and modern day Dolby or DTS has failed to do anything in the way of improving this.
The video also, originally shot on 16mm film, is typical of the low resolution available and again remastering has not improved it to any extent.
The lighting is boring and throughout is a dull red look, with no feel for the sparkle of a live concert.
Dedicated fans may look past these criticisms to the performance. This is true and valid, but if you are wanting some reasonable quality to enhance this, forget it!
I haven't seen the DVD version, but I would imagine it is exactly the same as Blu-ray cannot achieve the impossible and enhance the original anymore than standard DVD in this case.
If fans have not seen and can obtain a copy of the ""Deep Down Under"" concert, shot in Australia in 1988, this gig in my opinion leaves ""Ladies & Gentlemen"" for dead. Even though made for television and only in 4:3 aspect ratio, the video and stereo audio is great, as is the concert. I don't think this one is officialy available, but exists around the traps. The rehearsal footage, shot the evening prior to the main TV shoot is also fantastic and is as good as the show itself. I know, I have it!",1288224000,8,1427,4.534883720930233
4213208,5,B003W5C0VW,"This concert film was made in 1972 during the Stones' North American Tour, in support of ""Exile On Main St."" It was filmed on 16mm cameras, using the existing stage lights. In other words, it does not in any way visually resemble the modern day concert film.

Nowadays there are high definition video cameras covering every single inch of the stage, from the most optimal angles. The cameras can run uninterrupted for the entire show.  They aren't going to have film jam in the magazine. In fact, they don't have magazines (which, with 16mm film, only have about 10 minutes or so per reel before needing to be changed).

This concert is grainy and sometimes out of focus, with limited coverage of most of the band (outside of Mick Jagger). And regardless of all that - it is a glorious document of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band during a time when they truly had earned that title.

Want to see why Jagger is one of (if not THE) ultimate frontman of all time? See ""Ladies & Gentleman..."" Want to hear extensive lead lines from the most technically accomplished guitarist the Stones ever had (Mick Taylor)? Again, this is your film. Want to see a full concert with original Stones bassist Bill Wyman?  No slight on Darryl Jones, who is a very skilled musician and has never been acknowledged as an ""official member"" of the band despite over a decade and a half of service - but again, get this release if you want to see the man who created the original basslines.

In other words, this is the antidote to anyone under the impression that the Stones are a bunch of geezers who go through the motions (which you wouldn't be blamed for, given the last twenty years or so of the band as ""nostalgia/oldies act"").  This was made when they were at the best.  Oh - and you get to hear Mick join Keith for vocals on ""Happy""!",1288224000,3,1824,4.4894259818731115

I first saw this Movie in 1974 at the Trak Cinema in South Yarra Melbourne Australia, and yes it was in Glorious Quadrophonic-as an 11 y/o it left a big impression on me. From that day till now i have always gauged Rolling Stones performances against this film.

 They have never got close again. It is why i have trouble listening to the Ronnie Wood Recordings. Mick Taylor was/is just so good, it is he who makes the Band play beyond themselves, the same thing happened in '73 in Europe, Taylor made keith really work so hard

This Film is pure Rock n Roll, played so well.

So when i read so many average reviews i was very concerned.

 Now i will say, I have only watched and heard this in 2 Channel Digital Stereo. I don't have surround Sound yet.

So I cranked the volumeup Hard, and switched on the ""Loudness"" Button of my old but still Trusty Sansui Amp. And this old Girl came to life...WOW i was stoked.

 This took me straight back 36 years.  Even the look of the film is the same as it was. It was shot Dark, so i am Happy it still is. The loudness just gave Charlie & Bill the pump they needed. So i am really happy with this movie, the 5.1 i cannot comment on, but maybe the Audio had deteriorated over the past few decades.

I have my doubts that the original stock prints were well looked after,(Did Allen Klein own this?) so maybe the Audio is not compatible for a 5.1 mix. But to have that awesome stereo track is good enough for me

This is a Fantastic Concert Film, that's what it is. The Rolling Stones at the start of that whole 1972-73  USA-Australia-Europe tour, that so many of us have heard and loved on Bootleg recordings.

i will be watching this film Many times, and it will probably accompany me in my coffin!!
Waited so long for this.

November 1st. 2010

I Have just seen this movie on the BIG screen at the Cinema..The way it was always meant to be seen. Video & DVD players did not exist in 1974.
This film was shot as a Cinema experience.

So just remember that when watching...It is a old Grainy Film that has been salvaged (thankfully)

The Soundtrack in the Cinema was incredible. The Stereo Track in my lounge room was great once i had played with it, and set it up.

Think of this DVD like an older Car, it needs a little bit of love and attention. Set the Amplifier to it, think of the room you are watching it in.

It is a Concert movie mixed for cinema...Spend half an hour setting up your room to compliment the sound...it is well worth it.

When all of us are dead and gone, this movie will be what people will have of the Rolling Stones. This is the BEST film ever made about Rock Music.
The Stones are still together because this performance was achieved, & we have always hoped that they could emulate it again.

They won't. But at least this old girl is back in circulation, and it still sounds Awesome and full of Raw Power.",1287878400,10,3166,4.556537102473499
4213211,5,B003W5C0VW,"Having seen this tour in 1972 I still have vivid memories of this experience. Sadly not all are good. Many of those around me in attendance were in a drug induced state before the Rolling Stones hit the stage. I feared leaving my seat to get something to drink and taking the chance of having some idiot dropping something in it. That said, the show itself  was an incredible experience. As  this DVD brings to life the Stones were firing on all cylinders and in overdrive. From start to finish one awesome song after another. Mick Taylor was by far the best guitarist the Stones ever employed. His playing is clearly outstanding. Although at the time I believe he was only 19 or 20 years old and looks to be scared to death. The climatic ending will have you in a state of awe as the Stones tear the place down. Without doubt this is the best Stones concert DVD period! Warn your neighbors and turn this piece of rock and roll history up LOUD!",1287792000,7,944,4.388571428571429
4213212,4,B003W5C0VW,"Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones are both clearing their vaults of material we haven't seen in many years, if ever. This concert film was shown in theaters very briefly in 1974 and again in 2010. On DVD for the first time, it gives us an amazing 1972 set performed in Texas at the apex of the Glimmer Twins' career. The band is on fire and Jagger shakes his skinny a** off. Add the awesome Mick Taylor on guitar, Nicky Hopkins on piano, a tight horn section, a killer set list, and a low price, and you've got a must-see, must-hear, and must-have for any fan. After all, ladies and gentlemen, this is the greatest rock and roll band in the world! These 15 songs, originally released on the albums ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Let It Bleed,"" ""Sticky Fingers,"" and ""Exile On Main Street,"" are all classics:

Brown Sugar
Bitch
Gimme Shelter
Dead Flowers
Happy
Tumbling Dice
Love in Vain
Sweet Virginia
You Can't Always Get What You Want
All Down the Line
Midnight Rambler
Bye Bye Johnny (a tribute to Chuck Berry)
Rip This Joint
Jumping Jack Flash
Street Fighting Man

Rehearsal footage and interviews with Jagger from 1972 and 2010 round out the DVD. I give it four stars only because of the relatively grainy transfer and slightly muddy audio mix, but these are artifacts of a film and of technology that are 38 years old. The Stones' impact on the world and our memories is indelible. Don't settle for the geriatric group we recently saw on Martin Scorsese's ""Shine a Light"" (good as it was). Go back to the source, back to when rock was young and dangerous!",1287705600,46,1550,4.551971326164875
4213213,4,B003W5C0VW,"I will start by saying I have waited for this to be officially released for many years. I have had the bootleg versions from early vhs through the latest dvd (most of you know where I'm coming from).  While this is a cut above the vhs boots, I was immediately surprised to find it is not a whole lot better audio/visual-wise than the 4reel bootleg dvd.  That being said...they are still and always will be THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND IN THE WORLD...BUY THIS DVD!

Upon reading the comments to this review, let me add I am not in any way saying this is not a MUST HAVE for any Stones fan. I believe the quality to be exceptional as an historic document from an historic band at the pinnacle of their career and nothing less.",1287705600,3,727,4.291970802919708
4213214,5,B003W5C0VW,"In many ways ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" is the sequel to ""Gimme Shelter"", the classic Maysles brothers film document covering the Stones brilliant yet ill-fated 69 tour.  Here we are, less than 3 years later, the band roster still intact with Mick Taylor, and the Stones as dynamic as ever.  The music is flawless, the set-list is fresh and invigorating, and the added musical dimension, the horn section, launches the Stones down a new live-music direction that will last another 40 years and counting.
But something has changed in the 3 year span between Gimme Shelter and Ladies & Gentlemen.  Mick Jagger is still sneering, strutting and effortlessly controlling the vibe of the show, but he is now detached from the audience, no longer reacting with them or affected by them.  It is more of a ""show"" now than a communal experience, but it's still the greatest show on earth.

The camera work is a complete immersion into Mick Jagger, rarely cutting him out of a shot for more than a few seconds at a time.  The crowd is only there in sound, not a single audience shot can be found.  Jagger performs to a great black void interrupted only by the blinding cone-like spotlights following his every move.  The result is a feeling that we as viewers are sharing the stage with the greatest rock 'n roll band in the world.  We see every facial expression of each band member, we see the as yet unstrained rapport between Mick and Keith, and we even hear Mick's throaty moans underneath his harmonica playing.

The film is a combination of several shows, with several mysterious costume changes from Mick, and it ends too soon, leaving you wishing for more songs, but the end result is a perfect capture of the Stones at the end of their peak.  Within a few years Taylor would be gone and the Stones would evolve more and more into a shadowy parody of their glorious past.",1287705600,3,1865,4.638297872340425
4213215,3,B003W5C0VW,When I finally uncorked this I couldn't believe how bad the film quality is.  All the restoration performed on other films yield sometimes great results but not this.  This barely has the impact it did on its limited release which I viewed twice in Chicago.  It was that good.  This is not.  A a sound document it is really great.  Why not release it in high-res?  While you're at it release the studio output in high resolution file form like the Beatles did with the USB Apple.,1287619200,2,479,4.436781609195402
4213216,5,B003W5C0VW,"Never got to see the film in initial release and missed the one night only theatrical showing in September.  But I know great rock when I hear it.  After watching a pretty crummy DVD boot for several years, it is a refreshing blast of vintage Rolling Stones that we have here.

As other reviews have noted, the focus is strictly on the band and their music.  Forget the glitter eye shade that Mick is wearing, listen to the vocals instead. The interplay between Keith and Mick Taylor is superb and the remastered sound is incredible.  It's just like having the band in your living room for a private show.

Of course they had something to prove--Altamont was a disaster waiting to happen and their reputation was not helped by the film ""Gimme Shelter"" which put the focus on what went wrong rather than what might have been right.  They also chose Stevie Wonder as their opening act on the 1972 tour.  Stevie was just beginning to climb to the height of his powers, making him a tough act to follow.  So it was their end of a battle of the bands, so to speak, that you are seeing on screen.  It always takes a good companion act to push the headliner just a little bit above their game.

See it, buy it, love it.",1287446400,4,1212,4.366071428571429
4213217,5,B003W5C0VW,"I am glad the Stones camp finally decided to officially release this movie.  I bought the Blu-Ray version and was not disappointed.  Sure, the picture quality isn't pristene, and the sound is not absolutely perfect.  But for sure the sound is better than any bootleg I've ever heard of the 72/73 tour which makes this disc a must if not just for the audio.  In the ""extras,"" Jagger alludes to the Stones camp owning the copyright on the movie(?)so I hope they do the right thing and release this as a cd offering as well.  And for that matter, there must be bucket loads of concert recordings that should be released! Maybe the time has finally come with all of the nice releases recently?

Anyway, buy the Blu-Ray version of this disc.  The DTS soundtrack sounded pretty good to me considering the master is almost 40 years old.  I especially like the mix of the horns and piano in some songs.  And I'm not sure about all of the other reviews about MT's guitar being lost in the mix.  In the Blu-Ray DTS track it sounded just perfect to me.",1287446400,,1041,4.431578947368421
4213218,3,B003W5C0VW,"I bought both the blu-ray and the dvd versions of this. The blu-ray is great but the dvd is a different story. The sound level on the 5.1 Dolby and DTS tracks, particularly the bass, goes up and down. It's so bad that at first I thought my sub-woofer was cutting in and out. After closer listening and checking, by playing the same songs over and over, I realized it is the 5.1 tracks on the dvd itself. It does it on the same spots each time and also with different dvd players. The stereo Dolby track sounds fine.

This was not an issue with the blu-ray version. The 5.1 Dolby, DTS multi, and PCM stereo tracks all sound great.

The dvd version also switches layers during Keith Richards tuning up for ""Midnight Rambler"". Again this is not an issue with blu-ray.

Both versions are 110 minutes long with widescreen (16:9)aspect ratio. The main feature is a little over 82 minutes with the extras making up the difference.

If it wasn't for my satisfaction (pun intended)with the blu-ray I would have given this only one or two stars, or let's put it this way, if it wasn't for the bad sound on the dvd I would have given it five stars!",1287360000,9,1137,4.374407582938389
4213219,3,B003W5C0VW,"On the surface this release should've been the diamond jewel of live documents in the Stones' cannon. A very weak audio mix leaves this listener completely unsatisfied. The 5:1 surround is fake and honestly I wouldn't even care if the stereo mix included wasn't so muddied. There is a complete lack of detail in the definition of instruments, the clarity and sonic resonance is absent, it's rather harsh sounding and to make matters worse, the great Mick Taylor's leads are too low in the mix. Compare the sound on this to ""Get Yer Ya Yas Out"", The Rolling Stones 1969 live disc is pristine, it is warm, nuanced and vibrant and it's 3 years older than  ""Ladies And Gents"". What a pity, this was destined to reside at the summit of Rolling Stones live gigs.  I hold out hope that maybe the Rolling Stones themselves will take enough interest to actually supervise the mix themselves. Until then this was a missed opportunity. If you're interested (and after all this is a video presentation), the picture is less than stellar, both in actual quality and the artistic approach (way too many shots of the wrong Mick), but it was expected as it was recorded in the early 70's, and had this been afforded  an outstanding audio presentation as I expected, this would have been given 5 stars.",1287360000,9,1285,4.676991150442478
4213220,4,B003W5C0VW,"Ok, I have had many bootleg copies of this film over the years and it is unbelievable; the Stones at their best.  The sad thing here is that after 35 years of waiting what was released appears to be a direct film transfer without any corrections.  The Blu-Ray version contains scratches, film discolorations, specks, dust and drop-outs in the soundtrack.  Why after all of this time and with today's technology would they not fix these things?  Mick Jagger on the 2010 commentary mentions that they spent quite a bit of money to repair and restore the film deterioration from years of neglect.  Why go through that much trouble but still have scratches and whatnot very obvious in the finish product?  Also, the on the bonus features why not include the entire footage from the rehearsals?  They left out about half of it.  I don't get it but non-the-less I am still enjoying this greatly.  I have to deduct a star due to the poor remastering job.  Get it anyway!!!!",1287187200,3,966,4.662721893491124
4213221,4,B003W5C0VW,Great tunes. Stones at their career peak with the best lead guitarist they've had - Mick Taylor. The video could be a lot better BUT considering it's age it's more than acceptable.,1287187200,6,180,4.65625
4213222,5,B003W5C0VW,"WOOOOOW!!!!!!!! What a freaking monumental moment to finally see this in all it's glory as it was intended to be. Jesus, the sound is worth the price alone. I like a lot of fans before torrent sites came along, paid for a boot copy (dubbed from vhs) and were content on knowing and believing that this footage would never be cleaned up. We had a projecting viewing party and were grinning from ear to ear from start to finish. After Midnight Rambler my friend turned to me and said he felt like he needed to take a shower. I'm not sure how I can understand some of the negativity from this release.  I'm the biggest Mike Taylor fan there is and yes, I wish there were more shots of him and Keith, but you can't always get what you want!!!! No, it's not Avitar in 3-D, it's the Stones shot on 8mm in 1972. If you can free your mind of that, then your Holy-Grail awaits.",1287187200,11,868,4.228915662650603
4213223,3,B003W5C0VW,"Many Rolling Stones fans,  including myself, will agree, the Mick Taylor years were their best musically. For decades since their landmark 1972 North American Tour, Stones fans have anticipated the long awaited release of Ladies and Gentlemen The Rolling Stones. Historically, this concert footage is a must-have for any Stones fan. The years of waiting, however, may disappoint some die-hard Mick Taylor fans when it comes to the sound mix, but more on that below.

The first noticeable visual change, for those who remember the rare Drive-in Movie showings of this film is the elimination of the triple split-screen effect. Split screen was state-of-the-art in 1972, (recall the films Woodstock  and Elvis On Tour)  but, was always over-done to the point of being annoying. Eliminating it was a wise decision. By today's standards, the onstage camera work will appear almost primitive to the computer stabilized Skycam generation. Instead, onstage cameramen vied for position, and clamored for  a dramatic shot only to be foiled by a seemingly motionless Bill Wyman, curly chord stretched to the max, who had an uncanny knack for getting in the way.  Likewise, the stage lighting of the day was totally inadequate for filming, thus rendering more than its share of dark moments. If eliminating split-screen added to the continuity of the film, splicing segments from four performances certainly did not. Costume changes from one song to the next, even from an intro to the song itself are, at time more than just noticeable. Some may savor the concert filming of the day, and enjoy the aviance. Others may be reminded of the down side to releasing a 38 year old relic.

The sound mix on the non-Blue-Ray copy I viewed leaves a lot to be desired.  First, the over-all volume is lower than expected. Viewed on my PC with the volume maxed-out left me wanting more. Most annoying is a noticeable stereo panning effect that permeates most of the DVD. Mick Jagger's vocals, for instance, pan from side to side then come to rest in the center, like someone was drunk and experimenting at the sound/re-mix board. It's amazing to think that this problem was not noticed and remedied. Most disheartening of all is that Mick Taylor's guitar is not mixed as loud as on some live bootlegs, most notable, the 1973 European Tour examples that dot the internet. Taylor's guitar is not terribly low, and his masterful playing can certainly be enjoyed, but it sure would have been better if he were turned up. On the plus side, bringing up Bill Wyman's bass, that was previously always muddied in the mix of live performances, reveals what many fans have known for years: Wyman is a good bass player after all. Likewise, Nicky Hopkins's piano is more prominent and will please those who remember this great musician. A high end home TV/audio system may remedy some of these defects, but the casual viewer may be left wanting.

Tour rehearsal clips previously posted on the internet, or included on the DVD Stones in Exile reduce the impact of those Bonus Features included here (""Shake Your Hips,"" ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Bluesberry Jam""). An Old Grey Whistle Stop interview with Jagger, inter-mixed with performance flashes from the DVD, and a recent 2010 interview provide a then & now perspective of Jagger's take on the whole thing.

As a long-time Stones fan, I had to have this DVD. The 1972 Stones Tour with Mick Taylor is what many consider the highpoint of their career. Taken for what it is, and the technology of the time, the overall performance is not bad. The sound problems on the DVD release, and perhaps a better selection of Bonus Features rate this as three-and-a-half stars.",1287100800,75,3675,4.903381642512077

I pre-ordered it on DVD and paid a premium (Two Day Shipping) to have it arrive at my house on the day it was released.  I have two items about this film that are dissapointing.  First, the bass guitar is presented way down in the mix.  This wasn't the case in either the film or the house mix during their tour.  Second, there are places that the bass spectrum (bass guitar and kick drum) drop out altogether.  An example is during Tumbling Dice.  I'm hoping this is only a problem on the DVD version.  I've purchased the Blue Ray version, hoping their audio mix will be better.

Once I get the Blue Ray version, I will be returning either the DVD version or both.",1287100800,4,777,4.195945945945946

The PQ is fine but does show its age, and not sure how blu ray would offer any improvement on such mediocre source material. The DTS master audio offered is less than stellar, age of show notwithstanding. I say this because the PCM stereo track is outstanding. Definitely worth buying but buy the bluray for the PCM track of a great performance, and not for an upgrade in picture quality.",1287014400,,492,4.6022727272727275
4213227,3,B003W5C0VW,"Like many hardcore 70s era Stones fans, I had been waiting for this movie on an official release for years. When I first heard about the Eagle Rock ""restoration"" this past spring I was very excited. Last month I saw the movie twice in its limitied engagement and although I was disappointed in the restoration and felt the movie did not live up to the publicity the Stones and Eagle Vision had generated around it, I was hoping that this was simply becuse of the digital feed to the theatres - what I read had been a problem at some venues.  Well, I got my copy yesterday and I must what is out on DVD is no better than what I saw in the theatre. The colors in the film, so vivid in the original 1974 release and in subsequent theatre showings in the 70s and 80s, appeared really washed out or dead wrong in certain places. Brown Sugar, Tumbling Dice and YCAGWYW, for example, are three songs I have an almost photographic memory of - I mean I must have seen this movie 20 times in the theatres when I was a kid - and unfortunately Eagle Vision did not get it right. The colors are dull or flat out wrong. To be fair the Eagle Vision film is much better than any bootleg you will find and I found that it is pretty watchable on my computer. However when I watched the movie on the TV it was blurry and dismal and really no better than a boot. I don't know why this is becuase I have a very good TV. Too bad becuase many people have waited a LONG time for this. Had Criterion put this out they would have done a far classier job, both with the restoration and the packaging. I mean this film has never been released and has been affored cult status. IT IS A CLASSIC, and as such it deserved to be presented in the same wonderful type of pacakage we got with the Get Yer Ya Yas Out 40th anniversary release. However, there is nothing here but a DVD thrown in a cheap jewel case.  Anyway, to cut to the chase, it is certainly worth $10.00. But if you are a hardcore 72 era fan then expect to be disappointed.",1287014400,7,2005,4.151670951156812

4213233,4,B003W5C0VW,"This DVD version looks and sounds pretty good. The sound is full, although I think Bill Wyman's bass has been decreased a little bit compared to the boot versions. Wyman's bass is less boomy in the mix, but it's still there. The DVD also includes the possibly post-doctored backup/harmony vocals on ""Happy,"" just like the boots -- Jagger's vocals are heard along with Keith Richards', even though Jagger is away from the microphone (and out of frame). Maybe the audio was dropped in from another night, since this was shot over different days. Visually, the DVD is pretty impressive, although there are the occasional red/light brown patches on the right and left sides of the screen (mostly from one camera angle)- they're not overly annoying, but they are noticeable at times. They might have been just too much trouble to digitally clean up from the source prints? The rehearsal footage for the 1972 tour is interesting, although it's way too short. More footage would have been an awesome addition, but maybe more will be released later. The 2010 Jagger interview is decent, but not spectacular; the 1972 interview with Jagger is OK, too.

The group didn't have backup singers in those days so the songs sound different than the way the group currently performs them. See if you can locate a copy of their IMAX concert & buy that one!,1285545600,9,397,4.1688311688311686
4213237,5,B003W5C0VW,"There is no better concert film in my opinion. The release of this on blu-ray is a monumental event -- so many of us have been getting by with bootleg transfers of this seminal footage for so many years. Cause to celebrate if ever there was one. If you don't like the Stones, why are you reading this? If you do like the Stones and have not seen this (or attended an actual show on this tour), you do not truly know the Stones. I am buying a blu-ray player just for this.",1285027200,3,471,4.075268817204301
4213238,5,B003W5C0VW,"This is one of the greatest rock 'n' roll films ever made, performed by, arguably, the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever during, unarguably, their creative peak.  Some things not mentioned that really impressed me:  Keith, the rock 'n' roller for life, is so into the music that he spends much of his time facing the drums, playing directly to Charlie.  Jagger's musical professionalism really stands out.  There are many instances where he makes a point of not hogging the limelight when it's the other musicians time to shine.  Sometimes it's just by turning his back to the audience during someone's solo.  Other times, when the spotlights just don't want to move away from Jagger, he'd move over behind the soloing musician to force the light onto them.  When Keith starts singing ""Happy"", Jagger not only turns his back to the audience, but points a wagging finger at Keith to get the obstinate spot operator to illuminate the right musician.  And there was that moment during Bobby Keys' sax solo in ""Rip This Joint"" where Jagger starts to move away from Keys, but then comes back to adjust Bobby's microphone.  The mark of a true professional and something you just don't see much at that level of the music world stratosphere.

Taylor's solo during ""Love In Vain"" proves by itself what a great guitarist he is.  And there is one short phrase in his ""Street Fighting Man"" solo that should make send rock guitarist into ecstasy. Can you figure out which one it is?

If you are anywhere CLOSE to being a fan and/or student of Rock 'n' Roll, you need to see this movie.",1284681600,15,1572,4.676363636363637
4213239,5,B003W5C0VW,"Saw Ladies and Gentlemen last night, and was not disappointed in what I remember from 30+ years ago. Definitely biggest highlight was the sound. Theater was playing second disc of just released Exile cd, and when the movie proper kicked in you could feel the surround sound and volume go up several notches. Unlike the bootleg copy I've been watching the last 15 years you could hear Nicky Hopkins, Bill Wyman, Charlie, and both guitars playing off each other. (and feel the bottom end) I agree that both the focus and the lighting both were not what we are used to seeing in movies of the last 30 years or so. I think a lot of that had to do with when this was made. The lighting for this tour was pretty advanced for its time (huge mylar mirror hanging above and in front of the stage with giant spots behind the band shining behind and reflecting back at them). Probably not the best for shooting a movie. I agree a lot of the lighting was focused on Mick, and that was probably intentional at the time. But again, this makes the bootleg dvd look like a black and white silent movie. (not that I haven't enjoyed it)

Highlights from the movie were Tumbling Dice, especially the end with Keith, Charlie and Bill building that groove that you wish would go on for another 10 minutes, with Mick T. adding his special flourishes to it. Midnight Rambler that is as good as or better than the Ya Ya's version, because here the lighting during the mid section highlighting the tension of the song, and then when the whole band kicks in at the end with the whole stage lighting up works better than any million dollar stage and lighting has worked over the last 30 years. And last the last 3rd of the concert, starting with Midnight Rambler, and going thru Bye, Bye Johnny, Rip this Joint, (with Mick telling the audience they've been sitting on their a**es long enought), Jumpin' Jack Flash (where the house lights kick up and you get to see the crowd, for the first time, going crazy), and Street Fighting Man is what takes this from a great rock and roll concert movie to the GREATEST rock and roll movie of all time.

Three minor disappointments, when I went to this last night, there were only about 10 people in the theater. This was good because we were center theater, getting great sound with nobody around us, but made me a little sad that this might be an era of rock that isn't appreciated for what it was. Second, the bonus features that were on the origninal Fathom news release for this were not shown (the Montreux rehearsal footage, and the Old Grey Whistle test footage). Hopefully, they're on the DVD. Lastly, when I saw this in the mid 70s, I remember the theater lights going down, and nothing but a black screen, with background noise, and little blurbs of very occasional lights until you saw people going on stage and you heard the announcer say, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones. Now you have Eagle Rock Presents, and Ladies and Gentlemen breaking that up. All these did not diminish the fact that this lived up to the memories of this from almost 35 years ago.

I've went on too long. Seeing this again after 3 plus decades got me pretty fired up. Hopefully, the sound and improvement in picture can be transfered to DVD. (along with the bonus stuff that wasn't there last night.) This is THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL CONCERT MOVIE ever made.",1284681600,20,3369,4.51063829787234
4213240,5,B003W5C0VW,"I have seen this movie in various forms through the years - typically copies of copies of bootleg copies of bootlegs. Last night I saw the remastered film in the theater (it was released for a one-night-only showing), and it blew me away. The sound was as perfect as a 1972 concert can be, and the video was superb - FAR better than any version I've seen before. This is highly recommended for anybody who calls themselves Stones Fans, and is absolutely essential for anybody who was at any of the 1972 US shows.

No doubt I'm still somewhat euphoric after having just seen it in a theater, but this might be - MIGHT BE - the best rock and roll concert film every done. No fluff, no background info, no personality profiles - just one hell of a rock concert by a band at the absolute height of their powers. I've seen the Stones many times, and always felt this tour was by far the best. After last night, now I'm sure of it. A brief show by today's standards, on a small stage (the players are very close together), with period lighting, and the band starts with a bang and it only gets better from there. There's an incredible amount of energy on that stage, and more than a little bit of controlled chaos. God, it's freaking PERFECT!

It is pieced from four performances, so there's no clothing continuity at all, but who cares? Jagger has glitter on his face, Keith is playing unbelievable riffs, and Mick Taylor demonstrates why he's probably the most overlooked and underrated rock/blues guitarist who ever walked the planet. Wyman stands stock still (how does he do that), and Charlie Watts wears funny clothes and nails that backbeat like only he can.

Get this DVD. Don't even think about not getting it.",1284681600,15,1713,4.5372168284789645
4213241,5,B003W5C0VW,"Just saw this in a theater (one of those Fathom Events). It was awesome (makes me cherish the concerts of theirs I have actually gone to)! It was so intersting to see such a young Mick Jagger (he wasn't even 30 I don't think) and Mick Taylor. Of course I heard plenty, but I never really saw too much of the Stones with Taylor on film. I really liked it. Love Jagger's moves and the Elvis-esque white sequin jumper he wears! Stones lovers will love it *of course*",1284595200,3,463,4.2727272727272725

8407264,2,B003W5C0VW,"It's interesting that all the one and two star reviews seem to focus on the tech side of release. The audio, the video etc. because  Mick Jagger even hints at the fact that the Stones in this era could really suck. Am I the only one who feels this is a raged crappy performance? I barely wathced this once and have not gone back to it. I'm sure there were better performances for this tour but apparently they had it set that this was 'the' performance they were goiong to film, not knowing it was going to be a bad night. IMO if you want to see them at their best get the 'Live Some Girls in Texas' video audio or both. It's about a year after Keith Cleaned up and the whole band is just incredible absolutley on fire.",1522368000,,719,4.135714285714286
