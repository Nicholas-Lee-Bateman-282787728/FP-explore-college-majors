4744704,5,B005LAIGNC,"In my opinion, the 20 Jan 2012, review of ""Red Tails"" was off-the-mark.  The review stated that the flying scenes were great, but the ""ground story"" within movie, was shallow - rehashing old racial inequality themes.  However, the reviewer was wrong for TWO reasons:

First, as of 22 Jan 2912, ""Red Tails"" is the number two in the country, with a $19 million dollar purse for the first week!  Secondly, there was an apparent miscalculation by the movie industry writ-large, that the American public has somehow lost interest and draw power in a TRUE story of Americans overcoming overwhelming odds and adversity to fight for their country and for racial equality.

Red Tails delivers outstanding performances by both A-listers Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard as well as the up-and-coming supporting actors.  The action, tempo and effects were great.  The storylines for the characters were good as well.  The movie allows Americans the opportunity to review first-hand the bigotry and sheer ignorance of that time period, in hopes we will rise above it today.  And that perhaps by remembering racism and prejudice in the context of such magnificent sacrfice and human struggle will minimize the impact of the small pockets of poison that still lingers within our society, even today.

Red Tails is AWESOME true-story of America at its best, while simultaneously being at its worse.
Its a great movie to take young teens to, just as a reminder, although we haven't quite attained ""the dream"", perhaps they can step closer to attainment in their generation.",1327190400,54,1560,5.05859375
4744705,1,B005LAIGNC,"Over twenty five years after the fact and Maverick has become a drunk who makes hasty decisions under the influence, Goose has become a bit more reckless and still puts women before anything else, and Iceman's role has been reduced significantly as his smug arrogance is only felt in a handful of lines. What's that you say? Red Tails isn't the urban retelling of Top Gun? Well, you could have fooled me. It's not that it makes much difference though. No matter how you look at it, Red Tails doesn't really have much of anything to offer.

At the peak of World War II, African American pilots are considered the lowest of the low. They're considered to be incapable of performing their tasks to their country to the fullest and are given leftover missions that don't even qualify as scraping the bottom of the barrel. The Tuskegee training program is no different as the entire squadron is mostly reduced to shooting down trucks, trains, and perhaps a cow every now and then. That is until Colonel A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) succeeds in letting the higher ups give his men a chance and they take full advantage of the opportunity.

Red Tails feels really cheesy as soon as that quote is shown in the opening scene. The movie has a $58 million budget, but it certainly doesn't feel that way considering the opening credits. The amalgamation of planes ripping through the sky and tearing each other to pieces feels like a distraction or a cover up for the rest of your senses. Try to pay attention to the credits, how plain they are, and how cheap they look. That along with the score that feels like it was ripped straight out of a stereotypical action film from the 90s doesn't really seem like the type of tone they were going for here. The acting isn't much better as stiffness and monotony seem to be what they were aiming for. The Tuskegee airmen do begin to get a bit more comfortable in their roles as the movie progresses. David Oyelowo takes Lightning the furthest as far as Easy's (Nate Parker) squad goes, but they certainly seem their best in the face of tragedy. Terrence Howard has a few great moments, as well. Specifically his ""highest expectations"" scene he shares with Joe ""Lightning"" Little. But it isn't enough to save a second-rate film.

The script is very dry. I don't mean dry humor I mean about as pleasant as trying to listen to somebody with a mouthful of saltine crackers. It feels so stale and again contributes to that 90s atmosphere I mentioned earlier. Keep an ear out for the Americans and how third grade they sound. The dialogue along with the monotonous tone spread out amongst every actor in the film makes everyone come off as a robot. ""These cows are armed,"" is a line that's actually used in the movie. There are a few lines that are almost decent. Winky's (Leslie Odom Jr) line where he says, ""Every time I close that canopy I feel like I'm closing the lid to my own coffin,"" is surprisingly good. It gives the momentary belief that things may turn around, but they never do. Smokey's (Ne-Yo) ""colored"" conversation at the bar is the most amusing thing Red Tails has to offer, as well. There are many lame attempts at humor that just make you groan. Black Jesus is perhaps the worst joke of all, considering how things turn out for Deke (Marcus T. Paulk).

I was expecting Red Tails to at least offer a fair amount of eye candy, but the special effects weren't really all that impressive at all. There's a train explosion early on in the film that's been shown in nearly every trailer and TV spot. It's pretty much on the same scale as the train crash in Super 8, but it isn't nearly as spectacular. That's kind of weird considering Super 8 was $8 million dollars cheaper than Red Tails when it comes to its budget. What ruined it for me was that sloppy zoom-in effect that's relied on as a crutch the entire movie. The Tuskegee airmen will be in the midst of a heated air battle with the Germans. The camera would pan up to try and capture the action, but it would zoom-in (or out on a few occasions) nearly every time to try and show you who should be keeping track of. It just came off as sloppy camera work to me, as if they didn't have the proper camera placement for the scene and tried to adjust it accordingly. There are several things that don't really add up in the movie either. One of the main ones for me was that at one point, Easy tells everyone that there's no time to celebrate a completed mission and to return to base because they're low on fuel. But can you guess what they do in the very next scene? They showboat and celebrate. Not listening to your superiors and still getting praised for it is an overbearing theme in the movie, as well.

George Lucas fought for 23 years to get this made, but after viewing it you'll more than likely be convinced that the man has grown senile over the years and that retirement from Hollywood is the best thing for him. The turnout for the screening was insane and you can bet that Red Tails will more than likely make a killing at the box office, but there's no way in hell it passes as a good or even decent piece of cinema. Amateur cinematography, a boring script, terrible acting, and the fate of certain characters being extremely predictable (you can guess Lightning's fate around the time things start getting serious with Sophia), Red Tails is the equivalent of a stand-up act that gets booed off the stage. It is just awful. I was left wishing the entire movie was just Cuba Gooding Jr lifting a pipe to his lips, pulling it away, and pretending to smoke the entire film. If it was just those clips strung together with no dialogue and that dubstep track from the TV spot in the background, I could have at least gotten a good laugh out of it.",1327017600,31,5755,4.477142857142857
4744706,4,B005LAIGNC,"I was so excited to see the movie, that I posted ahead of time. Now that I've seen it, I thought it was a great telling of a true story. I give it a solid 4 stars, because the actors were excellent, the cinematography was good, the combat effects were actually better than okay. The music could have been better, but despite that it is an instant classic in my book.

The movie is fantastic because it shows the story of men who had to fight with honor and dignity against extreme odds in order to fight with bullets and power against our country's enemies. Their story has been represented before on film, and hopefully will again; it's a story worthy of being told over and over. Thumbs up to the actors, producers and all involved for doing a very good job. Was it the best of the best job possible? Maybe not, but it was entertaining and enlightening. I respect George Lucas for caring enough to put his money into this story, to bring it to the big screen like a major film, despite the reluctance of many other parties in the film industry. Could some other director/producer combination have made a technically more outstanding movie? Maybe, but they evidently don't care enough about the true story to do it. Kudos to all involved!

The events portrayed a version of history that was very engaging, and in a way that was also realistic. The heroes weren't shown to be perfect, with the flight leader having a drinking problem, for example, which seemed to cause problems, and one of the other pilots being a real hotshot. Overall, I gained a lot of insight into the difficulties that the ""colored"" pilots encountered but at no point did I feel like I was being ""taught"" a history lesson.

It seems like they didn't add a lot of extra drama to the story, which I almost wish they would have, altho the history as is has plenty of drama and heroism. The drama developed on several levels; first, the reluctance to put ""colored"" pilots on the front had to be overcome. Then, each mission had dramatic action, with all of the pilots and ground crew adding his sparky personality to the dramatic tone. I felt rise and fall and release of each dramatic thread.

I was already aware of the Tuskegee Airmen, and was excited to see what a George Lucas production would do with the story. Overall, I was satisfied, altho it didn't have the melodrama of a Star Wars episode, and I was looking for him to go overboard a bit, maybe just with the music. Those airmen were heroes and they really deserve to have a first class feature document the important, if not vital, contribution they made to the war effort. Now I know some of their names and I fell in love with them as patriots and gentlemen.

I saw Lucas on Jon Stewart's Daily Show, and he talked about how difficult it was to get this film distributed, because the big film distributors feared the audience would not be there for a film with a mostly-black cast. I hope their fears are wrong and this film is welcomed globally for it's production values, it's entertainment qualities, and it's documentation of a historical reality. I loved it, it's an instant classic in my book on many levels and am so happy to see this story make it to the big screen this way.

The audience showed up in droves, with the house being overflowing Friday night. The audience got engaged with the story, applauding at the end. I know a lot of us were happy to see the film and enjoyed seeing these heroes brought to life on the big screen.

Previous entry:
Feature film executive produced by George Lucas, who felt compelled to bring the inspiring legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African American pilots and crew, to the big screen. He called it the first all-black action film of modern times. We can expect to see an exciting true story told of the heroism of the people who rose above, aimed high, believed in themselves and used their brain, in service to our country at a time when their effort is credited with turning the tide of the war.

The ""Red Tail Angels"" were skilled pilots and fierce fights, often requested by bomber pilots, who wanted their escort to base. The Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 1500 missions between June 1943 and April 1945, many of which were as bomber escorts.

Unlike our beloved hero Luke Skywalker, who George Lucas made unforgettable, he is now bringing to our imaginations the real-life adventures of men who helped win the real historical fight against tyranny and hate. Let's get out there on January 20th and make it a blockbuster weekend!!!",1326240000,95,4531,4.5633456334563345

4745019,3,B005LAIGNC,"Red tails is a movie that is inspired by a true story: the first unit in the US Air Force (the so called ""Tuskegee pilots"" after the small town in Alabama where their training started in 1943) in which all pilots as well as the ground crew were African-Americans. For a film that celebrates and commemorates the trail-blazing heroism of the first American black pilots against Nazism abroad and White Supremacy at home, is the grotesque racial stereotyping of the characters, who mostly appeared to be in the 'Amos and Andy', gumbo and watermelon, 'Chicken George' mould. These intelligent young guys were trained pilots at the serious business of powered flight and war and I somehow doubt they were constantly wisecracking and playing Blues guitar or ranting about 'Black Jesus' as if they had just stepped off the plantation. Also, I don't consider realistic that a black American would flirt in 1943-44 an Italian girl without a second thought, that she would accept a black foreigner as boyfriend or husband! It's completely out of the spirit of the epoch and not believable a all. The German enemy were similarly cartoonish and equally offensively stereotyped. Whenever a US pilot shoots down a German plane, he shouts in jubilation: Yeah! I got him! The pilots act like kids who are playing a video game. But this is not a game. It is a real battle about life and death. That said, the film features some very good special air to air effects, but not overdone and there are some decent flight and dogfight scenes in it. I tried to like this movie, but it did not work. There are too many flaws, which I cannot ignore. Red Tails cannot get more than three stars.",1502928000,,1668,4.715753424657534

4745096,5,B005LAIGNC,"While everyone has heard of the Tuskegee airmen, this is a movie which does a ""deep dive"" into who they were & what they accomplished during World War II.  As such, this film is LONG overdue.  Facing an Army Air Corps that was deeply resentful due to a prevalent racism in the military, the ""Red Tail"" squadron nonetheless served with distinction and contributed a great deal to the defeat of Hitler in WWII.

Sadly, many of the Tuskegee airmen gave much more to their country than they ever got back as they returned to a country that was deeply divided over racist paradigms in the 50's and 60's.  The movie comes at a prescient time as white supremacists have become emboldened with the nomination of Donald Trump as President and Jeff Sessions being appointed as Attorney General.

While the present administration looks to turn-back-the-clock on civil rights, it is up to us to block that gambit.  It is also prudent to look back on how we have come thus far;  Joe Louis, Jackie Robinson, Jesse Owens and Doug Williams have done much to dispel myths about African Americans being ""inferior"" athletes.

4745580,1,B005LAIGNC,"This is the second War movie that I have ever walked out on. It's one cliche after another and not a solid story to be found. The dramatic moments seem like they were written by a freshman in high school literature class. The story tries to incorporate too many elements and fails at all of them as the characters don't strike me as believable, nor did the combat scenes --as far as the way they conducted themselves in the air, not to mention the fact that the Bomber squadron apparently didn't know how to recognize their own air support without a fly by. I also point out that a character like Lightning would not have been in the air to begin with --no one would let a pilot fly who didn't follow orders. It's very clear to me that whoever wrote the screen play did not do very much research into the military aspects of the movie nor did they put any serious efforts into fleshing out the characters. The only thing I can say about this movie was that the planes themselves were exiting.",1471910400,,992,4.367567567567567

In many places the movie seemed disjointed and possibly directed or written by two different sets of people.  From reading the trivia I believe that some scenes were redone by George Lucas himself so the disjointedness makes sense.
Some parts were very good, some parts were mediocre, some parts were bordering on not so good.

Then I read the comments and saw people complaining that it's not realistic and things like that and gave it a poor score. Now tell me, is this movie marked as a documentary? It might be based on a true story but its not gonna be exactly that story. This film was made to be an entertaining movie. And even though it is a false rendition of the true events it still uplifts their story. It made me want to look into the history of the red tails. And it teaches a good lesson that the color of our skin doesn't make us any different from one another. No matter how you put it you can't disagree with me on that. It is the ultimate level in the sense they trust them with their lives.

Bottom line, if you are looking for a documentary that is going to be realistic and true to every detail this isn't for you. If you are looking for an entertaining movie about WW2 airmen this is for you. Plus it has the conflict of not only man vs man but also man vs society adds to story, enjoyment, and something not very common even by today's standards.

4747221,1,B005LAIGNC,"This film shamefully opens with a lie as the setup for what would be support for another lie. A combat wing of B-17 bombers is abandoned by its escort of P-51 Mustangs when German fighters appear, and we are immediately clued in to the upset disposition of the Bomber pilots` rhetorical questions complaining of their escort leaving them unprotected to pursue the German fighters coming up to attack the B-17s. Then, more Bomber pilot comments about how it never fails  as if to suggest the escorting Mustangs were either incompetent of their duty to protect the bombers, or cowards to stay and fight with the bombers.

I have no idea what the Star Wars` prodigy George Lucas was intending to do with his distorted, incorrect and unfinished story called the Red Tails, but whatever it was, he failed miserably, and he did little good for the real 332nd, the Public who paid for this Politically Correct (PC) propaganda film, or history. Because NONE of it is accurate to the facts. Most of all, is the disservice Lucas and staff did to the Bomber crews and other aerial warfare members of WWII, including the Germans.

There is a ""myth"" that the Tuskegee Airmen (the 332nd Fighter Group) ""never lost a bomber they escorted."" That's a lie; there were many bombers lost in combat and by flak when the 332nd was escorting them. Unfortunately, this deception has been claimed and continued by some of the remaining Tuskegee pilots that still exist. Another lie that the film opens with is that the bomber pilots saw departing fighters flying escort as abandoning them, to imply they were cowardly for not staying with the bombers.

The FACT is, the fighters were specifically ordered in February of 1944 by Jimmy Doolittle, who'd just taken over command of the Eighth Air Force to ""pursue and destroy,"" because it was proven THAT was the only way to keep the German Fighters from attacking the Bombers.

Another lie in the film is that the P-51 Mustangs flew formation escort with the Bombers, which was tactically dangerous and never done, because Mustangs (and the P-47s) couldn't slow themselves down to the paltry 180mph average speed the B-17s and B-24s usually flew at, without dropping flaps and making unsafe emergency maneuvers to evade or attack if the Fighters got ""bounced"" by Germans from above -- a common tactic both employed.

Secondly, the best tactic used by the fighter groups to protect the bombers was to fly 10,000 feet above and to the side, because the German pilots had their attack technique down to an art, called ""twelve o'clock high"" for a reason. This required a wide parallel flying turn into the bombers while flying outside of the bombers deadly .50 cal gun range so they could climb above them, get in front, then dive downward head-on blazing away. Once they completed this ""fly through"" attack at over 600mph closure to the bombers, usually taking out anything in the first row of ships with ease, they flew beneath, behind, around, then climbed and circled back in front of the bomber formation to do it all over again. So, the P-51 Mustangs and P-47 Thunderbolts were NEVER in formation with Bombers during such defense; and the Bomber pilots never expected it nor requested it, because it wasn't tactically feasible. Pure Star Wars crap.

Cuba Gooding played a pilot in the predecessor film, ""The Tuskegee Airmen,"" so he's no stranger to the ""implied"" history of the 332nd Fighter Group, nor the politically correct message both films have tried to make in appeasing the black community.

The TRUTH is, of all the ""Fighter Groups"" (FG) of the Mediterranean and European theater during WWII, which each had THREE (3) Squadrons of Fighter aircraft, ONLY the 332nd was comprised of FOUR Squadrons, of 16 aircraft per squadron (plus a half dozen spares). Why does this matter? Because the 332nd was ONE THIRD larger in number of (black) pilots, compared to every other Fighter Group in the Air Force, by its having 64 to 70 aircraft. So the statistics by which ""performance"" is gauged is inflated by a 1/3 larger force. In spite of this politically correct omission to story telling that is proffered at the beginning of each film as ""based on a true story"" -- the performance statistics of the 332nd is at the bottom of ALL the American Fighter Groups.

So here are some FACTS for anyone who's interested: The movie may state only 66 pilots were ""killed"" in the 332nd, but combat losses according to military records show 98. The 332nd Red Tails was ""on station"" (deployed for combat) for 23.3 months, and flew 1,578 missions, but only had 112 aerial kills. (No ""real"" pilot counts the ground kills, but those too were shallow.). The 332nd had a Kill to Loss ratio of 1.14. That means for every black pilot that was lost, they killed 1.14 Germans. Another statistic is kills per mission, which the 332nd had 0.07 (zero-point-zero-seven).

By comparison, one of the less notable, non-""TV"" or ""movie"" Fighter Groups, the 357th, with only the typical THREE (3) squadrons (48 aircraft, plus spares), was on station for ONLY 14.9 months; flew only 313 missions; yet it had 609 aerial kills (56 on just ONE DAY alone, which is exactly HALF the total kills the 332nd took TWO YEARS to achieve, and stands as a record that has never before or after been touched by any fighter group of any country). The 357th lost 128 aircraft, giving it a Kill to Loss ratio of 4.75; and kills per mission of 1.94, or 27.7 times higher than the 332nd.

One of the two companion fighter groups next door to the 332nd, literally, as part of the 15th Air Force in Italy, was the 31st Fighter Group; which was on station for 33.0 months and had 571 kills. The second companion Fighter Group of the 15th Air Force, also next door to the 332nd was the 325th. The 325th FG was on station for 24.7 months; shot down 529 enemy aircraft, and flew 550 missions, and suffered 176 losses, for a kill to loss ratio of 3.0.

What's important about the 31st FG and the 325th FG, is they were PART of the SAME mission assignments given out to the 332nd Red Tails, because they were all out of the same Mediterranean theater, and literally only a few miles apart. So anyone who wants to compare the 332nd as being segregated out and not seeing the same duty as the 31st and the 325th Fighter Groups, let alone their joint task force escorts with the Eighth and the Ninth Air Force into Germany, simply doesn't know anymore about history, than they know about the truth of the real Tuskegee ""experiment.""

One last point: The Eighth Air Force's 357th Fighter Group, with 3/4 of the men, fighting for 2/3 the time as the 332nd Red Tails, produced 42 ACES. The companion Fighter Group next door to the 332nd, the 325th -- produced 27 ACES; while the second companion group of the 15th Air Force next door to the 332nd Red Tails -- the 31st Fighter Group -- produced 33 ACES. (An Ace being FIVE kills.)

The 332nd Tuskegee Airmen Red Tails, with 33% more pilots and three times more missions, produced ""0"" (ZERO) ACES.

In the words of one of the greatest lines, by one of the greatest actors, of one of the greatest films of all time: ""There's nothing... I detest more... than the stench of lies."" Too bad Lucas doesn't understand this.

The script, well... there is none. The ""three act structure"" any good story is built upon doesn't exist. The dialogue is totally PC with the typical contemporary spin on adjectives and nouns we've come to expect in placating the black community, also of which is historically incorrect. In fact, the predecessor film, The Tuskegee Airmen -- save for the CGI benefits of today's computers as used in Red Tails -- has more ""story"" to it than this limp example. Cuba Gooding and Larry Fishburne (of the first 332nd story) are two excellent black actors, of many. (Sorry, but Denzel is my favorite.) It is disappointing to see Cuba sign on to a script that is so racist, inaccurate and poorly produced. He should fire his agent; and rise above the never ending need for Black Hollywood to prove something. Black Hollywood, which includes many White producers, like Lucas, should take a page from the history books of the Greatest Generation, which a small part of is represented by the 357th, 325th, 31st, mentioned above, as well as the 4th, the 55th, the 56th, the 78th, the 339th, the famed 352nd, the 353rd, the 355th, the 356th, the 359th, the 361st, the 364th, the 479th, and the 9th Air Force's 354th and a few others.

NONE of these heroes need to stand on a hill, or have Hollywood stand on its hill and yell how great they are; especially with embellished half truths and outright lies. There's a lesson in this Lucas and all the other black propaganda film producers should take away. Because it does NOT do the Black community any just service. Fortunately for Lucas and the like, the real heroes he denies and insults with such historical embellishments are above calling him out for it; while I am not.

If you want to live in Fairy land and cheer for the downtrodden blacks of America, this ""fictional"" film is for you. But it certainly has no place in real history, anymore than it deserves a beginning subtitle proclaiming it is based on a true story; for there's little truth about it. The fact that the story line, the script, the continuity, the ""character arcs"" (something Cuba should study on his next project) are all absent, only underscores why this film sucks, in addition to the insult it does to the other Fighter Groups mentioned above, and the Luftwaffe pilots who had no problem ""flaming"" Red Tails. I originally gave this two stars; but after sleeping on it, I rescinded this to one.",1433116800,4,9637,4.688941454760497

4747224,1,B005LAIGNC,"When the 332 Fighter Group, usually known as the Tuskegee Airmen, started flying bomber escort missions in May of 1944, much of the Luftwaffe's front line combat strength had already been decimated, largely as a result of Operation Pointblank, which reached its peak during Operation Argument, Big Week, February 20-26. This was a focused attempt, largely the brainchild of Jimmy Doolittle, to savage Germany's aircraft industry and decimate its fighter squadrons. It went into full scale during January of 1944, and ended in April, as bomber missions then started a concentrated campaign to cut Germany's supply of oil and to cripple its transportation infrastructure prior to D-Day. The Tuskegee fliers took no part in it. During that period, the Eighth Air Force's top pilots ( based in England , and under Doolittle's command ), Francis Gabreski, Robert Johnson and Don Gentile scored 10, 15 and 19 kills on Luftwaffe fighters, respectively. John Godfrey, Gentile's wingman, shot down 6 ( incidentally, the Gentile/Godfrey team was the most famous fighter pairing of World War 2 ). To make this as clear as possible, between January and April of 1944, these four pilots downed half as many planes as the entire 332nd did IN ITS FULL YEAR OF FLYING ESCORT MISSIONS ! Contrary to the film's adolescent dramatics, fighters were directed to seek out and pursue German fighters BEFORE THEY COULD REACH THE BOMBERS ! Dead Germans could not hurt the bombers, and bomber losses to fighters plummeted throughout 1944 ( however, German flak got much worse, as 88mm guns were pulled from the Russian Front to protect German cities). Likewise, accompanying bombers over target areas made no sense for our fighters, as German fighters usually struck before and after the B17s and B24s hit their industrial targets SO AS NOT TO BE SHOT DOWN BY THEIR OWN FLAK ! Flying over target thus put fighters at unnecessary risk from flak, which they had no power over during escort missions. Regarding the Curtis P 40 ( which is loudly complained about in the movie by 332nd pilots ), British, Australian and South African pilots were very successful against Axis fighters with them in North Africa ( Clive Caldwell , top Aussie Ace, notched 20 kills with the P 40 before being transferred to the Pacific ). At the same time the 332nd was receiving P 51s, The Flying Tigers (14th Air Force ) were still overwhelmingly dependent on P 40s, using them to great effect the spring of 1944 to thwart the Japanese Ichi-Go Offensive in China, not completely converting to P 51 Mustangs until June of 1945. CONCLUSION : The only way to enjoy this movie is by knowing little about WW2, nothing about the air war, less than nothing about the war in the Mediterranean, and much less than nothing about the air war in the MTO. Spielberg has colluded to insult every other American fighter group, especially the other six ( 1st, 14th, 82nd---all flying P38s---31st, 52nd, and 325th ---all flying P51s the last year of the war ) that served the Fifteenth Air Force along with the 332nd. Those six groups downed over 1,400 Axis planes, on average each credited with twice as many kills as The Tuskegee guys. GOT THE PICTURE ?

So called  ""crossover"" movies. which have a mixed cast, do better. I am white, but I found Red Tails to be very powerful, and I have watched it three times. The fact that this squadron really existed and really had a superb war record is a wonderful answer to those who deny the achievements of people of color. The CGI-generated fight scenes are exciting, althoug as a pilot, I found some fo them unrealistic. For example, the show P-51 Mustangs flying in amongst bombers. P51s flew too fast for that and would have been typically up above the bombers weaving about to stay with them. No problem though. It was still fun to watch the fight scenes, and the appearance of the first German jet fighters was a treat for aerial battle buffs.",1427500800,,1080,4.56701030927835

To best look at this film, it is best to take a closer look at the historical framework that encompasses it. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military flyers in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, like other Black Americans in many U.S. states, they were subject to the Jim Crow rulings and the American military was racially segregated. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to racial discrimination, both within and outside the army. Their contribution to the air war was significant; their red-tailed aircraft were a welcome sight to the B17 bomber crews, which were escorted to and from their bombing missions.

This is a film, in part, attempts to tell the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, a segregated squadron of African-American fighter pilots. Without the help of George Lucas, this film would not have probably been made. His aim was to give the black American pilots of the Second World War the kind of homage they have been denied so far by Hollywood. Unfortunately, the film has faults in terms of its corny complement of clich&eacute;d characters and other ground based situations.

This is a film, which is heavily fictionalised version, of the events as they transpired.
The combat scenes are good and seem relatively well developed; however, they are hamstrung by a two dimensional narrative on the ground that sells this film short.

Sadly, this movie placed too much emphasis on the personal stories of the airmen while in Europe which was punctuated by hackneyed dialogue. Moreover, the viewer was left to believe that these airmen were little more than undisciplined, unprofessional frat boys rather that skilled aviators.

4748561,5,B005LAIGNC,"RED TAILS [2012] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] From the Creators of Star Wars and Indiana Jones! Amazing and Adrenaline Fuelled Big Screen Action!

Academy Award Winner Cuba Gooding Jr. and Academy Award Nominee Terrence Howard, lead a powerful ensemble cast in this high-flying epic inspired by the real-life adventures of the first African American combat unit to serve in World War II in Italy in 1944. As the war takes its toll on Allied forces in Europe, a squadron of black pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen are finally given the chance to prove themselves in the sky...even as they battle discrimination on the ground. Featuring jaw-dropping aerial action and thrilling special effects, RED TAILS is a breath-taking tribute to the unsung heroes who rose above extraordinary challenges and ultimately soared into history.

FILM FACT: Interview with Rick McCallum [Producer], 9th June, 2012: ""When I first started working with George he told me about the story and the initial plan was to make this epic three or four hour movie. We wanted to start in the United States and show the full racism these guys had to go through, then go to the heroic story that were telling now and then come back and do the beginning of the Civil Rights movement. But it was just so unwieldy and also at that time, there was no way to have a roadshow three-hour movie in American cinemas. Every epic film had been a financial disaster, and we felt there just wasn't an audience we could get the film out to. Then we got heavily into Young Indiana Jones, which ran for three or four years, then the Star Wars Special Editions and the prequels, but throughout we did continue talking. However, once we finished Episode III we decided to go and meet people in the black community."" February 2013, RED TAILS won the NAACP Image Award in the categories of ""Outstanding Motion Picture"" and ""Outstanding Independent Motion Picture"" at the 44th NAACP Image Awards.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The story of the Tuskegee Airmen is one that has been told and retold several times through the years, mostly on television but occasionally in films. The story itself is memorable and deserves to be dramatically interpreted, to varying degrees of praise. RED TAILS is a good story that George Lucas himself decided to be Executive Producer for it, but it would not be the first time he was attached to something, would he?

Based on a book from John B. Holway [Red Tails, Black Wings: The Men of America's Black Air Force], Aaron McGruder [The Boondocks] and John Ridley [Undercover Brother] adapted it into a screenplay which Anthony Hemingway, in his feature film debut after directing on several television shows. For those unfamiliar with the story in general, a group of African American pilots who graduated from the Tuskegee Institute's training program were given the opportunity to fly for the United States in World War II. However, their missions were primarily focused on harmless, unguarded targets, perhaps in part because the Pentagon felt they did not have the skills to fly more advanced missions to escort bombers. At the urging of the Airmen's Pentagon liaison Colonel Bullard [Terrence Howard], they get what they have been yearning for, and the squadron's commanding officer, Major Stance [Cuba Gooding Jr.] rounds up the pilots and gets them ready for what easily is their toughest combat challenge yet.

As for the pilots, each has their own personal eccentricities that they bring to the unit. The squad leader, whose call sign is Easy [Nate Parker] is neck and neck when it comes to being the most accomplished member of the group, though he tends to be a little more reserved. The more outgoing pilot on par with Easy is Lightning [David Oyelowo], who is my most least favourite actor of all time, who is a little more rambunctious and even has a girlfriend in the Italian town near where the squad is stationed. You also have Junior [Tristan Wilds] and Joker [Elijah Kelly] rounding the group out.

The group gets along well together, whether it is battling a literal battle-scarred Nazi pilot who serves as the face of the Third Reich, or whether they are battling forces on their own turf, whether it is in Italy or at the Pentagon, where a racist officer [Bryan Cranston], fits the bill. But Cranston is one of several different plot devices the story employs to make you buy into the journey the pilots take, along with their stereotypical personal demons, be it drinking, philandering or the like. And that is the big problem with the story, the characters are hardly memorable. We come into the film with them possessing a certain amount of justifiable swagger being part of the military yet getting sore from bumping their head on the ceiling, but the characters are constructed lazily and without care, almost as if this is Top Gun for the World War II sect.

There is no denying the dogfights are totally breath-taking and even provide some investment into characters one might not care about otherwise, but their time on the ground is about as prolonged and meaningless as the time in the air is exciting, and over the course of these two hours, drags the film down tremendously, to say nothing for its predecessors. And casting wise the ensemble of that one shows the one in RED TAILS how to do work, simply put. You get the journey, you get the flights, and you get the emotional payoff. You also get Cuba Gooding Jr., which is an added bonus, to a really totally brilliant action packed Second World War film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Momentum Pictures gives RED TAILS a stunning 1080p encoded image and an aspect 2.40:1 high-definition presentation which looks quite good. Lots of wide sweeping shots of the airbase brings out a lot of detail in the image, but there is also image detail in the foreground that looks impressive as well. With Lucasfilm being involved in the visual effects, the dogfights are breathtakingly sharp and lifelike, and you can make out the red on the planes vividly in the sky. In less hectic scenes the facial pores and threads on Army uniforms can be made out nicely also. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Not surprising we have a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack for Red Tails and again with Lucasfilm involved, expect to have your socks rocked. The big takeaway I got from the film was that with all of the sonic action, the soundtrack delivers precisely and efficiently. Dogfights are as immersive as expected, with bullet hits and planes whizzing past and around you on all channels, and for those who fall in battle, the subwoofer meets them to give crashing planes a low-end emphasis in their impact. In quieter scenes the dialogue sounds clearly and in 'louder' scenes like a bar fight they are transmitted clearly and without concern. About as perfect a soundtrack as I've heard on a Blu-ray disc so far.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Interview with George Lucas [Executive Producer] [1080p] [3:00] Based on what's shown in this tiny feature, George Lucas appears to be the most hands-on executive producer of all time. I imagine that he had more say in the making of this 20-year project than anyone else. The funniest part is listening to him describe these as ""real dogfights"" while images of green screen cockpit footage is being shown. He also manages to work 'Star Wars' into his three-minute mouthful.

Special Feature: Interview with Anthony Hemingway [Director] [1080p] [6:00] Likewise, Anthony Hemingway describes how he got involved with the project. We also get to see the cast meeting with some real Tuskegee airmen.

Special Feature: Interview with Terence Blanchard [Composer] [1080p] [6:00] This feature shows a lot of talking. Terence Blanchard talks about his inspirations, goals and themes. I enjoy musical features, but this one is pure time-filler.

Double Victory: The Tuskegee Airmen at War [1080p] [66:00] Narrated by Cuba Gooding Jr., this historical documentary is much better than 'Red Tails' itself. This feature tells the real story of the Tuskegee Airmen, not the contrived bologna that makes up the movie. It features actual testimonials and archived footage along the way, very similar to the videos that accompany both 'Band of Brothers' and 'The Pacific.'

Special Feature: Movie Magic [1080p] [5:12] With an hour of dogfights, there are between 1,600 and 1,700 effects shots in this action packed film. Yet we're supposed to get the grandeur of it all in this five-minute video. More time is devoted to showing that ILM [Industrial Light & Magic] couldn't do it all on their own and how they outsourced shots to foreign companies.

Theatrical Trailer [1080p] [1:29] Dramatic Film Trailer for RED TAILS.

BONUS PLUS: Here included is an insert leaflet, giving you the inside information and history of the Royal Air Force Museum located in Colindale in Central London.

BONUS SLIP COVER: With this Region B/2 Blu-ray, you get a fantastic beautiful designed 3D Slip Cover.

Finally, RED TAILS has the right thoughts in mind, they just don't articulate them well, and expect you to be dazzled by the visual effects, which admittedly are pretty good overall. Technically the Blu-ray disc is totally amazing. If you are looking for a mix of a good demo disc and bonus material, then this actually turns out to be a decent Blu-ray value. What makes me upset is all the reviews I have read, gives such bad negative views on this film, mainly the American ones and to be honest I think they are totally embarrassed, because of how the American public treated these brilliant Black American Airmen in such a despicable racist manner, in making out they were subnormal, where instead us in Europe treated them as equals, so that is why I enjoyed this film so much more, as it informed me a great deal of the history of World War 2 that I had no idea happened and will give you endless hours of enjoyment, especial the amazing CGI trick photography. Another wonderful bonus with this UK release is the wonderful designed 3D slip cover that really makes this UK presentation so much more exciting, than its standard US Region A/1 Blu-ray release cover. Highly Recommended!

I have studied quite a bit on the topic and the real story is just fricken awesome just as it is, even Hollywood could not outdo reality!  So I watched this and..........I am beyond words on this movie. Why they had to create this garbage as a tribute to them should embarrass everybody.  These gentlemen were well educated, not the outcasts from Gone with the Wind as they are portrayed.  Unfortunately the writer (I assume to be from Mrs. Smiths' 1st Grade Class) put less effort into research than I do to make my coffee in the morning.  The number of major errors is just unforgivable.

4749367,1,B005LAIGNC,"One finds in the records of known kills by the Tuskegee Airmen the creation of a myth as the airmen were actually more effective at shooting slow moving ground vehicles or parked aircraft on runways. One finds the following in their records:

--112 enemy aircraft destroyed in the air, another 150 on the ground and 148 damaged [nearly 300 shot up ON THE GROUND while parked!  Was this an example of their skill and courage?]
--950 rail cars, trucks and other motor vehicles destroyed (over 600 rail cars) [wonderful, did they even bother asking what supplies or persons were in those rail cars?]

Most of the enemy aircraft destroyed in the air were no match for the P51 Mustang and the airmen had very few kills of either the FW 190D or the ME262, Germany's leading bomber and P51 destroyers.  The closing sequence of the movie is so fanciful as to be laughable:  The ME262 fires its 30MM cannon at the P51 (a single hit from this cannon would have eviscerated the P51) and the P51 pilot is seen blubbering his swan song over the cockpit radio while bleeding to death for 15 minutes and crashing.

I can't say which is more historically correct, it has been awhile since I heard details from other sources.

4749455,1,B005LAIGNC,"Gee, where does one begin with this cartoonish excuse for real moviemaking?  Supposedly based upon true events, specifically that of  the 332nd Fighter Group's service in WWII, it is a cliched, horribly scripted juvenile fantasy romp through the air war against Germany, and manages simultaneously to trot out virtually every national stereotype  to a ludicrous degree.
Ve have, of course, ze snarling, bloodthirsty Luftwaffe jagdflieger, straight out of  Hollywood circa 1944, along with the nasty racist white officers, etc.
The CGI depictions of aerial combat, while exciting, especially for an 8 year old, are insultingly ahistorical, aeronautically absurd, and full of ridiculous chatter that would never have occurred in combat, on either side. Just bloody awful.
I studiously avoided this movie, but it turned up last week on the FX cable channel, so, like watching a car wreck in slow motion, I watched.
If anyone wants to see a movie that accurately depicts the European air war, not the MTV, Twitter, etc. version thereof, I suggest viewing the great ""Twelve o'clock High"" from 1949.

Added are a big budget, some great CGI shots of aerial combat, an escaped black POW that somehow makes it home, and a pointless -if not demeaning- interracial romance.
Missing -and sorely missed- is the strong presence of Laurence Fishburne, Courtney B. Vance, Malcolm-Jamal Warner and John Lithgow. Of the original cast, only Cuba Gooding Jr. returns, but in a less meaty role.

CG has become a crutch in movies these days. Instead of having realism we have ridiculous CG effects that have no shred of reality.

It really was just eye candy with weak plot lines and overly simple acting. I hate when I watch a movie and almost feel forced to pick out its predictability and mistakes.

4749622,1,B005LAIGNC,"The produces/director of this movie took what should have been an excellent story and turned it into tripe. Glaring at you right away, and very disappointing to me, are the ""special effects"". They do nothing but turn the movie into a video game. The flight scenes were so outrageously bad that I almost didn't finish the movie. The face-on scenes of the pilots in the cockpits were, if possible, worse. The cockpits were so wide and absolutely fake looking that I imagine the actor sitting on a bar stool in front of a blue screen with everything drawn in around them. Making matters worse, the story and characters are very poorly developed. The many sub-plots are equally poorly developed. No background on the forming of the 332nd was given, and I would think that that was important. Cuba Gooding's charter bounced between Washington DC and the front in what seemed like the time between lunch and dinner . . . it was like . . . huh? He's where?

Another reviewer has given good marks to the actors . . . I can't. If ever a movie was done with the ""actors"" just going through the motions, this is it.

I almost gave Red Tails two stars because of the importance of the story; but can't due to the miserable quality of the movie. It is times like this that I wish Amazon's one star rating didn't say ""hate it"". I did not hate the movie, it simply is very poorly done. If you want to see a good movie on this subject, watch ""The Tuskegee Airmen"", a TV movie from 1995.

4749623,4,B005LAIGNC,"I found myself moving about in my chair, dodging bullets just as the Tuskegee pilots were doing in their cockpits!  The film definitely succeeds as an action drama, but the underlying theme of civil rights and racism is even more important to the telling of this story based on true events.  While the episodes of racism may seem brutal to modern audiences, I suspect the real events behind this film were much, much worse.  I withheld a star because the racial overtones as depicted were just a bit too glossy and rosy to believe.

The film is beautifully photographed with exceedingly clear visuals and excellent sound recording.  Much of the film had to have been produced using CGI, but it is artfully and believably accomplished.  I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in WWII, and especially the story of the courageous men and sacrifices of the Army Air Corps' Tuskegee experiment.  It is a story that needed to be told and needs to be remembered.",1399766400,,966,4.783132530120482
4749624,1,B005LAIGNC,"RED TAILS concerns only part of the story of the pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen, the combat missions.  This film does not concern any aspect of the recruitment or training of the pilots.  While racial issues are presented throughout, they are disclosed only in a manner that is somewhat tangential.  The opening minutes of this movie consist of phony-looking computer graphics of flying formations.  Thus, in order to tolerate this movie, which contains an abundant quantity of CG-generated flying scenes, I suggest the viewer pretend that he is watching a STAR WARS movie.  For any person who has watched WWII movies that were filmed during the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and so on, the combat scenes, hardware (airplanes and guns), prison camp escape, and love story with a local Italian woman, will be familiar ground.  Many of the scenes were already familiar to me, since I had already seen THE GREAT ESCAPE (part of RED TAILS was copied from Great Escape), TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH (part of RED TAILS was copied from this film), MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT (part of RED TAILS was copied from this film).  RED TAILS includes some stories-within-a-story, but so do many films and television shows.  The stories-within-a-story include the fact that one of the airmen likes to chug from his liquor flask and the resulting questions about his ability to function optimally.  Another story-within-a-story is the fact that one of the airmen falls in love with an Italian woman, and there is an amusing scene where the mother of the Italian woman plants herself in between the couple on their first date.

RED TAILS COMPARED WITH TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN.  RED TAILS is not a compelling film, for three reasons.  First, as mentioned above, many elements were cobbled together from existing movies.  Second, the computer graphics looked phony.  Third, the film called TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN is by far the superior movie.

TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN, starring Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding, Andre Braughner (leadership role), and John Lithgow (redneck congressman), is far superior, for the following reasons.  All of the elements of the Fishburne movie are part of a coherent and integrated whole. For example, the episode with Eleanor Roosevelt was intended to disclose the overcoming of racial prejudice.  The episode where the airmen landed on a country road in America was intended to disclose the overcoming of racial prejudice.  The episodes with Lithgow were intended to disclose the overcoming of racial prejudice.  The episode where the redneck from Texas decides that he wants his bombers to be protected by the Tuskegee pilots, is one of the most stirring moments in the history of American cinema.  TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN starring  Laurence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding is one of my VERY FAVORITE MOVIES from the past 50 years.  In contrast, RED TAILS can reasonably be characterized as a ""cinematographic booger.""

In  contrast, RED TAILS does not have much of a point, except to transfer money from the public to Lucas Films.  The Fishburne movie has plenty of soul-stirring moments while, in contrast, RED TAILS merely occupies time.  About three quarters of the time of the Fishburne movie concerns the recruitment, training, and comradery of the airmen, and about one quarter concerns combat.  In contrast, the primary source of character development in RED TAILS, is in the irrelevant story the Italian girlfriend.  TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN is ensemble piece, where Cuba Gooding is one of the main actors while, in contrast, Cuba Gooding plays an extremely small role in RED TAILS.  The prominant advertisement that Cuba Gooding acts in RED TAILS is deceptive and misrepresentational. It is clear and obvious that the goal of Lucas Films is to confuse the public into thinking that RED TAILS is the only movie that you should be thinking about, in the situation where somebody tells you that Cuba Gooding is acting in a movie about Tuskeegee airmen.  IT IS NOT THE CASE that Cuba Gooding does much in RED TAILS.  His presence in RED TAILS (playing a minor part) is only for a couple of minutes.  In contrast, in TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN, which is an ensemble piece, Cuba Gooding is one of the main actors and he is seen continuously until his airplane sustains some trouble. TUSKEEGEE AIRMAN with Laurence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding came seventeen years earlier than RED TAILS.",1399507200,3,4342,5.054775280898877

When comparing it to it's predecessor  I don't think they truly focused the struggle for respect and fair treatment of the African-American involvement, or the pains of war during WWII properly like they did in Tuskegee Airmen. It lacked a lot of the depth for the racism showed during that time and volume of the respected earned after the fact, and even the individual accomplishments pilots actually had. The glory-seeking showboating impulsive and zealousness for the young pilots was overkill. Most of all I really didn't like how they made the Cpt.of what i think would be the section leader for 332nd to have the issue of the bottle. (drinking while on duty). The way some things were done in the movie toward the end were OK.

I was actually a little disappointed with this movie in spite of the fact that I was already aware of the possibility it may or may not be as good as Tuskegee Airmen but I still kept an open mind. I think if I actually saw this at the theater I would have been mad.

4749914,3,B005LAIGNC,"I saw Red Tails while I was stationed in Germany, and it occurred to me when I was on my way to see the movie that it was a somewhat historic moment, for me personally at least. Here I was, a black Airman in Germany, on my way to see a movie at an American military base about the first black Airmen and their exploits in the skies over Germany during WWII, the first such movie to feature an all black cast, almost 70 years later. The Tuskeegee Airmen, in more ways than one, were directly responsible for the fact that I had a seat in the theater. They fought for the rights that I take for granted: the right to be an American Airman; the right to be a full and free citizen of my own country; the right to simply sit wherever I want in a movie theater. Ironically, it took George Lucas 23 years to secure a release deal for the film, even though he financed it himself, because it had an all black cast, and no studio believed that a film with an all black cast could make money in wide release.

Despite the significance of the occasion, the movie itself left me feeling ambivalent. I'm glad the story was told. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it. But I can't say I was happy about the the way the story was told. You could quibble about the movie's artistic choices (for instance, seriously, what was up with Ne-Yo's Bubba Gump shtick?), but it was more than that. George Lucas tells a story about a group of men who fought for the opportunity to prove that they were skilled and courageous combatants. They certainly proved that, and the film celebrates that fact, but it does so at the expense of the story of the Tuskeegee Airmen's larger struggle. They didn't struggle to be allowed into the fight simply for the sake of proving that they could in fact fight. In risking their life for the nation, they were affirming their claim to their own country, and eliminating any possible excuse for being denied their rights as citizens. The interviews done with the Tuskeegee Airmen in the years after show that they were fully conscious of that fact:

[Speaking of the ""Double V"" campaign launched by the Black press] ""The idea was that we should have a victory. Not only a victory over Adolf Hitler, but that we African-Americans should have a second 'V', the victory over the prejudice and racial segregation that was endemic in society also.""

-Mr. Lee Archer, former Tuskeegee Airman

The movie never goes anywhere near that social and historical context.  But that context is crucial to understanding the depth of character the Tuskeegee Airmen possessed. As courageous as it was to face enemy combatants on the battlefield, it took far more courage to do so when the citizens of your own country would refuse, for instance, to allow you to use an off-base commercial laundry service, preferring instead to accept laundry from German detainees. While their white comrades in arms had to fight on the battlefield, the Tuskeegee Airmen had to fight every moment of every day, before, during, and after the war, to be simply treated as human beings.

However, as far as the movie is concerned, it was simply a matter of some obstinate old school racist officers who were determined not to let them fight, and therefore put word on the street that they couldn't fight. Then, after they demonstrate that they're actually s***-hot pilots, they're immediately welcomed into the Armed Forces fraternity and everything is cool. It's a reflection of a narrative about the history of race in America in general that shrinks from acknowledging the depth, intensity and complexity of the racial prejudice that afflicts this nation. In the context of a movie that aims to pay tribute to exceptional courage in the face of exceptional adversity, that kind of timidity is especially unworthy.

I still think the movie should be seen. But I think it should be seen with a commitment to use it as a launching point for starting an honest conversation about what the Tuskeegee Airmen's mission truly was, and what still remains to be done to to fully accomplish it. That would be a truly worthy tribute to their memory.",1395273600,,4116,4.637860082304527

The story, though, is very disappointing. The film gives a nod to the trauma these guys went through to become pilots but no more than that. It's really just a 1950's style tub thumping 'this is how we won the war' propaganda film. Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that's what you want. I found it incredibly old fashioned. Even the Germans involved were caricatures.
The storyline spends too much time with one of the pilot's unlikely amorous adventures with an Italian girl. The required love interest I suppose, for today's formulaic plot lines.
What I expected was a story of how these guys became pilots, how they managed to turn the tide of discrimination and perhaps even a little of what happened to them postwar, a la Band of Brothers. What I saw was trite and banal and certainly not an improvement on the average 'Tusgekee Airmen''.
Perhaps it's too much of a story for a film and would be better as a TV series. Tom Hanks - are you listening?",1394841600,4,1220,4.524886877828054

I honestly don't know how they recreated  what looked like real bombing missions and sorties flown by these guys but it is very lifelike and believeable  If you like WWII movies especially the aviation part as I do you will truly enjoy this movie and appreciate what these guys did. The aircraft used in the movie, P-40's and P51's , are superb and the action scenes are great. The only negative about the movie I have is that some of these guys were portrayed as not exactly pilot material. The very opposite is true when you view the ""extras"" on this DVD. I enjoyed this as much as the movie. Interviews with surviving ""Red Tails"" affirm the fact that these men were very educated and had an extreme focus on thier mission in WWII -  to get the job done , to prove the color of one's skin does not limit thier capability.

4750466,4,B005LAIGNC,"A good overview of the first all Black fighter squadron consisting of Tuskegee Airmen, but one that fell short of the mark as an historical epic film, which it could have been.  Most notably, the film did not go deep enough into the obstacles and deep seated discrimination these brave men faced as pioneers in the U.S. Army Air Corps, which helped lead to the integration of our Armed Forces and American society in general.  I would have liked to have seen more instances of the actual discrimination and maltreatment of these men as they reported to duty and undertook their training and how they overcame this adversity with dignity.  The producers short-cutted much of the historical details in the film which most people would have been interested in favor of the love interest of one of the flyers and action flying scenes that often looked too much like computer generated video games.  The action scenes were invigorating, but it didn't seem like World War II, but more like the Korean War. Also, thought the depiction of the German aviators and Soldiers in the film was a little mean spirited.  Cuba Gooding did a great job as the commander, but the director and producers should have spent more time on plot development in making this a more serious film.",1390003200,,1266,4.762557077625571

The special effects were not well done and script needed more work. In addition, the movie was missing a representation of African American women. They sent their  husbands, sons, fathers and brothers off to war but there was no representation of that in the movie. The only woman in the film was a European character that was not well written.

True, black men flew planes in WWII, painted their plane tails red and were treated badly by the white government.

It is a shame that the real history of those courageous Black men were treated by a movie, in such a flippant way.
But that is how Liberals see black people, as caricatures.

I found myself wanting more historical accuracy. There are a lot of records of what those American Heroes did.

There is no mention of Black Patriot Frank Mann who taught the Tuskegee Airmen how to fly and no mention at all of white Patriot Howard Hughes, the man who as a lifelong friend of Frank Mann, made sure the US government sent the Tuskegee Airmen their new planes.
The new planes were a really big deal.

I expected to see tap dancing at any moment.
I cannot believe that the black actors read the script and still did the movie.

Hopefully Lucas' Educational Foundation will be more historically accurate, when trying to reform and improve K-12 education. But I doubt it.

4750887,2,B005LAIGNC,"The CGI resulted in my giving such a high score.  The sight of P-40s, P-51s, Bf 109s, Me 262s and B-17s made the movie worth watching.  Why did the producers leave out P-47s which the 332nd FG also flew?  There are too many gross errors in this movie to take it seriously.  Why are the Mustangs flying close escort in the middle of a B-17 box formation.  Even close escort fighters flew above, on either side, in front, or in the back of the bomber formation.  And they would not be flying at the same speed as the bombers but would be weaving at a higher cruising speed.  No American fighter pilot would frontally attack a Me 262 with its four 30 mm cannon which would have shreded the Mustang.  What we see are .50 caliber bullet holes in the Mustang cockpit canopy.  One 30 mm explosive shell would have fragmented it.

We see the P-51 strafing a German destroyer and setting it ablaze from front to back.  This is based on the experience of a flight of the 332nd FG's P-47 on 25 June 1944 where they claimed to have been the only fighter strafing attack to sink a destroyer.  In fact, the ""destroyer"" turned out to be a motor torpedo boat, the TA 22, which was ex-Italian, which was only damaged and able to return to port.

The fight with the Me 262s was based on the 24 March 1945 mission and the movie shows the 332nd shooting down four Me 262s for several losses.  In fact, the 332nd claimed three destroyed and three damaged.  The 31st FG was also escorting the bombers and claimed five Me 262s destroyed and three damaged.  Actual German losses were three Me 262s and one damaged, with all four pilots wounded.  None were killed as shown in the film.  The 15th AF was known to be lax in their confirmation procedures and at times the overclaiming was overwhelming.  The 332nd lost five fighters that day, one of which force-landed in Russian territory.

The movie ""Red Tails"" is no worse than some of ""historical"" documentaries I have seen which also distort the facts but the CGI effects make the movie worth seeing.",1379116800,2,2027,4.441734417344174

4750967,1,B005LAIGNC,"Since Hollywood was established around 100 years ago there have been numerous war films made. Some good, some bad. Red Tails has to be quite possibly the worst ever made. This movie was budgeted at $58 million yet how this movie made the $49 million it did to me is a mystery.  Had George Lucas not come to this films rescue I think it would have done even worse!
Many claim that the Tuskeegee Airmen really made no great impact in WW2 at all due to how Germay's top fighter aces had been either killed or captured in prior years.  Yet I am white and I agree regardless of skin color these men were still soldiers nonetheless and deserve their place in history.  Yet with that being said this film did these brave men no justice whatsoever!  It had several scenes that were historically innacurate if not plain corny!  The high remarks listed here at Amazon to me leave me scratching my head as to how they would even get any high remarks at all!
Bottom line, this film is a rusted out resounding clunker!  Dont waste your time with it.

***Update 1/29/14***
Just out of curiosty a few days ago I asked a friend of mine (who's dad is full blooded Italian) if hypothetically speaking had black aviator back in WW2 had fallen for an Italian girl would her parents approve.  I also told him about this movie.  His response (and I'm quoting) ""hell NO, her parents would not!""  He went on to say ""first of all the girl would have known better!""  He told me there are some interracial relationships nowadays in Italy but not many. He added in WW2 that was a totally different time and no way would such a union like that be approved of. Again, these are HIS words not mine!
This casts another shade of silliness to the historical accuracy of this corny movie.  And no I'm not saying, implying or alluding in any way that interracial relationships are not a good thing but if you make a historical movie how about focusing a bit more on accuracy!",1376611200,5,1939,4.430985915492958

4751103,4,B005LAIGNC,"There are two historical incidents which are commonly referred to as ""the Tuskeegee Experiment"".  This is the more uplifting of the two.

The Second World War was a time when the world changed radically, then changed radically again, and then again, and on and on for almost six years.  This was true not only geopolitically (three of the world's major powers destroyed, two others risen to a new category of ""superpower"") and technologically (the transition from prop plane to jet, from TNT to U-235), but culturally as well.

People often talk about the regimentation required by war, but too often fail to notice how a war can force a country to give up some kinds of regimentation, such as sexism and racial segregation.  Rosie the Riveter is  a feminist icon today even more than during the war, and the ""Double Victory"" the Red Tails fought for is still worthy of celebration.

This is a story worth being told, and it is told very well with superior scripting, acting and special effects.  Even if your only interest in the Tuskeegee Airmen is in the planes they flew, there's plenty of that here.  I'm rather fond of the old warbirds myself (I set up a Yahoo group, ""Airboy"", in honor of one 1940s aviation series), and I definitely enjoyed that aspect of the film, but there's a good deal more to see here.",1372550400,,1315,4.658008658008658

4751186,5,B005LAIGNC,"The film is an honest tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen who served as fighter pilots in WWII.  Their war was not only against Goering's Luftwaffe but also against against racial discrimination.  This latter war was ubiquitous, whether in their home country, among the closed society of the front-line white airmen of the Army Air Corps and their commanders, or their adversaries, the Aryan defenders of Hitler's Germany.  The film ably illustrates these conflicts, but it does more.  We come to know the fighter pilots, their immediate commanders, their fears and their strong affection for each other.  Indeed, the writers and director have even found space for love in this excellent film.  The hot-shot pilot ""Lightning,"" who leads the destructions of a Nazi train, a well-armed enemy ship, and a Luftwaffe fighter base, has sharp eyes and a habit of ignoring orders. His romance with a beautiful young Italian woman whom he first spies close-range from his P-47 skimming above the rooftops is touchingly realized before it ends in tragedy.",1369699200,,1040,5.124260355029586

4751299,2,B005LAIGNC,"OK, the point of this movie is drama and not realism. But, c'mon. The drama is one dimensional, the acting amateurish.

And the realism, or lack thereof. A P-40 running down a ME-109 from behind? Rubbish.

Hopping out of a P-40, hopping into a P-51 for the first time, and flying combat immediately? In the real world, this would result in a bunch of smoking holes in the ground at the end of the runway.

Sure, some ME-262s were shot down by P-51s. But not in evenly-matched dogfights. If a P-51 got behind a ME-262, the German would just use his 100+ knot speed advantage to leave the area.

The colonel and the major did not fly with their men. This is leadership? When I was flying, the boss led the mission, especially if it was a tough one.

Some great special effects, which you expect from Lucas.

In reality, the Red Tails did have a sterling combat record. But from this movie, it's hard to believe.",1369180800,2,909,4.413173652694611
4751300,1,B005LAIGNC,The movie seems to consist of individual parts made by men in their spare time as they thought of scenes.  Then in the end the scenes were put together in the order they were completed and the whole thing was called a movie.  That is my opinion of the whole movie.

4751302,4,B005LAIGNC,"RED TAILS is a riveting war film that's based on the true story of the 332nd Fighter Group (Tuskegee Airmen) who, though one of the finest groups of fighter pilots in WWII, faced enormous discrimination and denigration simply because they were African-American.

Much of the acting--with special mention going to Ne-Yo as Andrew ""Smokey"" Salem --is excellent. Some of the script is a bit staid and corny, and a few plot details are a little hard to buy, e.g., a P-40 coming out unscathed after single-handedly destroying a German warship? Still, even the blatantly inaccurate parts of the film are very gripping, a quality that most of us want, right?

RED TAILS is carefully and expertly filmed but has a sort of 70ish war thriller ambiance to it. Yet, with a few exceptions, the animation is pretty convincing. Anyone who simply enjoys watching aerial combat will not be disappointed. The 15-minute Double Victory Highlights Featurette is definitely worth watching, either before or after you watch the film itself.

4751387,2,B005LAIGNC,"The story of the Tuskegee airmen is a wonderful story full of genuine drama - heroism, overcoming of racism, America growing up in its attitudes, formation of what was essentially a highly trained and decorated unit despite every obstacle they faced.  In this version though, the storytelling is alas so clunky, that no end of beautifully photographed postcard Italy and shoehorned romantic subplot or inserted action scenes can rescue it.  There is a good looking cast and some genuine production values, but saddled with a script which from the opening scene seems amateurish and contrived, sapping the movie of the genuine awe and respect of the airmens achievements that they deserve.  Cuba Gooding Junior needs to find something gritty to rebuild his career, and Terence Howard survives the movie with some dignity and gravitas, but the lines and situations they are given to handle  are flat and artificial.  The movie charts the pilots in the squadron, trying to show their different ways of handling the stress, while building up from their initial delegating of trivial flying tasks to their escorting of bombers to Berlin, against a squadron (!) of German jet fighters.  There is less a plot, more a series of subplots charting the evolution of the squadron - and some of those subplots just go nowhere.  When one of the pilots was captured and we see him arrive at a PoW camp, I thought this was finally going to show what it meant to be of African American descent under German control, but no - the moment is squandered.  If the script is handled in screenwriting 101 style, it isn't helped by the lack of weight in the effects - you'd have to say on the face of it, that the planes actually look very well rendered.. it's hard to imagine improvements in what cgi could do - and yet... they just don't look real, and the physics of how they are thrown around the sky doesn't look real either.  How much more satisfying and thrilling it would have been to have real aircraft in dogfights - but I guess these days that may just not be possible any more.
At the end of the day, the Lucas brand, even only as producer, has not been advanced from his Star Wars days with this effort, and the movie plays out as if an adaptation of a comic strip - when what the story needs is something gritty and real to truly express the horror, the bravery and the historical importance of what the Tuskegee airmen did.",1365897600,2,2413,4.6323185011709604

4751468,3,B005LAIGNC,"How inaccurate is this film? Let me count the ways...

Tuskeegee Airmen are gods of the air--real John Wayne-types. Two of them end up straffing a Nazi warship and killing hundreds (never mind the fact that German Navy NEVER LEFT PORT after 1943, with the exception of the U-boats)

The godlike airmen attack a German airbase in a pair of slow, outmoded P-40s. We can see the ground guns scattered all over the place. They would have been shot down IN THE FIRST PASS.

The Airmen down several Me-262 jet fighters in this film, one of them in a face-to-face duel (okay, ONCE a Tuskeegee airman shot down a 262 using an absolutely incredible maneuver shown in the film. I HOPE he won a medal). But according to Chuck Yeager, who flew the same skies and fought the same enemy, virtually ALL 262s were shot down as they attempted to land at their airbases. The Nazi jet planes were too fast to stop otherwise, even for P-51s (and despite the Messerschmit's lousy turning rate).

A Tuskeegee Airman gets captured by Nazis, escapes, and is returned to his unit. Sorry but this NEVER happened. If you were shot down and escaped, you were sent to ANOTHER THEATER OF WAR to insure that if you were captured again you couldn't reveal to the enemy the identity of the French/Italian/Greek/Romanian/whatever Resistance fighters who got you to Allied lines.

That said, the gear, machines, and planes you see are portrayed pretty accurately and the CGI was incredible. The action is cool if overplayed. In fanboyese this is WING COMMANDER, not THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK View this film as an incredible dogfight shooter videogame with a World War II theme and ignore the stupid, inane personal plots and you will have a good time.",1365638400,7,1714,4.719063545150502

4751670,1,B005LAIGNC,"Very predictable from Lucas films, which is like a factory now days, with writers who seem to do their work on the can. Corny, stiff dialogue. Like a schlocky comic book. A routine love affair between one of the pilots and a local girl from the village near the base, which is tedious enough to put up with that I just f-Fwd through it. The computer-generated animations LOOK like computer-generated animations. Finally, the historical detail is abysmal, aluminum finish B-17s near the end of the flick, when all Flying Forts had the brown drab and beige paint scheme throughout the war; then there is one scene of the base commander talking to his pilots in the air from the base control tower with what looks like a palm-sized radio, like you'd get at Radio Shack right now, in fact, the top end of it even resembled a cell phone. Portable radios back then in that pre-transistor age were almost as big as a guy's fore arm. Do Lucas and Hemingway care? Apparently not. On top of that, the voice in this scene plainly sounds like it was recorded in a studio and dubbed onto the scene. Very tacky. Nine, ten-to-eleven year old little boys might like it, but don't count on this as any kind of adequate history lesson.",1362355200,9,1217,4.561643835616438

I have been a moderate fan of Cuba Gooding for a while but this performance would have been better and more believable had it been done by the pets.com sock puppet.  Instead of a microphone, of course, the sock puppet would have to be holding a pipe!  I'm not a pilot and flying Alaska Air still doesn't qualify me to comment on the aeronautics of the spectacle but the writing was horrible, the acting took place off set and the story was formulaic at best.  Thank heavens I got it from the library, even then it cost me too much.  I am still wondering how you get a cockpit full of fuel in a fighter and how you take cannon fire through the wings without igniting the fuel actually there in but hey, I fly Alaska Air....

In germany we say that the movie is only for US-guys who don`t know how the war over our country really was. I know a lot of veterans (some US, some british and of course most german) and nothing in THIS movie is realistic.

And one question left: WHY are the german soldiers always played like bad guys? Our fathers and grandfathers were fighting for our land, like every soldier. They weren't good or bad. In Germany we say ""ah its a hollywood movie. good action but no historic facts"".",1361318400,7,662,4.471074380165289
4751676,2,B005LAIGNC,"As an aviation buff and military history's enthusiast, I hade great expectations for this film.  While some of the flying sequences were interesting, they were pasted together with entirely predictable....and dare I say stereotypical, performances.  Anyone who hasn't lived under a rock must appreciate the struggle minority soldiers, sailors and airmen endured to serve a country where they all to often were marginalized and unappreciated.  However, the acting in this film fails to connect those facts at a gut level at least from my perspective.  Much better in that respect can be found in a film such as ""Glory""...but of course just about anything with Morgan Freeman in the cast is pretty much a winner in my book.  The bottom line is that if offered as a rental, it might be worth watching for the flying scenes.

This is something that has been needing to be publicized for many years, and, if this kind of movie was needed to do it, fine.  Maybe one day there could be a more ""serious"", ""down-to-earth"", ""thought-provoking"" movie made of the services of The Tuskeegee Airmen, but this was a good start.  CGI is here to stay, and, today, this is the only way they're going to be able to make those historic-airplane movies.  They're just not around in significant numbers.

But outside the cockpits, the story is a bit on the lame side, with some pretty cheesy cliched dialogue in places. George Lucas is responsible for the best part of this film...the CGI dogfights between the Tuskegee Airmen in their P-40s and P-51s and the German airmen in their ME-109s and Me 262s. The fact that some of the dogfight scenes are reminescent of ""Star Wars'"" battles between Rebel X-Wing and TIE fighters is evidence of Lucas' involvement. Cuba Gooding, Jr (who also was featured in HBO's ""Tuskegee Airmen"" and Terrence Howard (who played a Tuskegee Airman in ""Hart's War"") deliver good performances, as do the other actors, most of whom are unknown to me, who portray the Tuskegee pilots. Although the plotline is based on history, the events in the film are largely fictionalized. This is a good film and an excellent tribute; but we need a better, more fact based film to commemorate this evolutionary chapter in American history...and to better honor the black airmen who trained at Tuskegee.",1359331200,,1152,4.8232323232323235

I like that the movie shows the ""struggles"" Black people had to endure to service their country in a time of global war when Jim Crow ruled America.

4752466,5,B005LAIGNC,Too bad this didn't get more media coverage. It is a great aviation movie. It also tells an all too familiar story of flying during a war. I'm proud that they flew. The challenge they overcame was great but they did it. They are the genuine military fliers. I wish commanders in the military backed their men that way today.,1355356800,,324,4.416666666666667

One black colonel and one white colonel believe in the 532nd and are in the states to convince those in charge that this black unit is capable of serving.

Though it has the typical language of a war movie, the blood is less than I expected. It is a bit more lighthearted than most war movies, though I suspect this is to expand the viewing audience for more people to learn of the Red Tails story.",1355356800,,561,4.2924528301886795

4752571,4,B005LAIGNC,The movie was excellent in always.  Action packed but also gave a good perspective on the Negro part of the US Air force squadron in WW11.  We all really enjoyed the dog fights.,1355097600,,177,4.333333333333333

4752573,4,B005LAIGNC,Delivery was fast and without any problems. This movie is pretty good.  Its based on a black fighter squadron in world war two. It would make a good addition to any dvd collection.,1355011200,,180,4.454545454545454

He said they were great pilots and a tribute to the Marine Corp.  I love this movie.

4752577,3,B005LAIGNC,Ok B movie. Acting was average. The font used in the tile opening graphics is the worst choice ever in film history. That other movie Tuskegee Airmen was much better at tugging the heart.,1354665600,,187,4.529411764705882

4752670,4,B005LAIGNC,"This film was panned by critics from my generation (mid-thirties) when it came out earlier this year but I am glad I ignored them. They were mostly complaining that the film was too sappy and the actingwas terrible. However when I watched the film, it was obvious to me the filmmakers were trying to make a war film like they did back in the 50's and 60's. I really loved the style of this film and its overall innocence. My dad absolutely loved it and I ended up buying him this film on Blu Ray for his birthday.",1354492800,,513,4.244897959183674

4752672,1,B005LAIGNC,Great picture and quality but halfway through the entire computer blacked out and I had to master restart it which took everthing off of my computer. I'm not sure if it was the quality of the computer or this but I still haven't seen the rest of this movie and I am salty about that.,1354320000,,283,4.163636363636364

4752674,1,B005LAIGNC,"One of the worst movies ever produced; so unreal; the black pilots used their modern 2013 Ghetto talk while flying fighter planes in combat; this never happened back then.  The Africans flew to safety whenever the germans showed up; and left the B-17s with no protection.  If you want to see reality; watch Memphis Belle and Twelve O'clock high for a true movie about real flyboys.  This red tails is simply worthless and all BS.

If you want to live in Fairy land and cheer for the downtrodden blacks of America, this ""fictional"" film is for you. But it certainly has no place in real history, anymore than it deserves a beginning subtitle proclaiming it is based on a true story; for there's little truth about it.",1354233600,,716,4.6141732283464565

I learned so much about this group from watching this movie and I was so impressed with the actors.  The footage from the aircrafts was so real and this movie kept our attention from the beginning to the end.  My wife watched the entire movie with me and she cried at the end because she thought the movie was so touching.  If you are looking for a feel good movie that's still good for the entire family, get this movie.  This was our first Blu-ray movie and it was just like HD.  You can tell that a lot of hard work went into this movie to make it a classic.",1354233600,,666,4.076923076923077
4752676,1,B005LAIGNC,"Without the good, occasionally great, visual effects and engaging aerial combat sequences, this entire film would be unwatchably bad. every single character is one-dimensional and ridiculously cliche, from the scowling, melodramatically villainous Germans to the standard pre-fab action movie cliches the Tuskegee Airmen have been reduced to (the cocky, wisecracking ace; the plucky, naive kid; the gritty, pipe-chomping flight commander, etc.). The plodding, predictable script is abysmal - chock full of heavy-handed expository dialogue right out of a bad comic book, period-inappropriate language that makes it impossible to pretend you're watching the 1940s, and tired plot devices. The acting from this mostly talented cast is poor - wooden, forced and insincere, probably a product of the awful script. And if all that wasn't bad enough, toss in a throwaway romantic sub-plot that's totally devoid of plausibility, sincerity and chemistry.

In short, this movie is about what you'd expect from George Lucas - a truly terrible film with cool and exciting action sequences. Star Wars in World War II. It's no wonder he had so much trouble getting it distributed. The Tuskegee Airmen deserve so much better than this stinker.",1354060800,11,1228,5.497354497354498
4752677,4,B005LAIGNC,"This is a fun movie which covers a lot more than just a bunch of black fliers in WWII.  These guys had what it takes; and a lot more.

4752708,2,B005LAIGNC,"The Tuskegee airmen offer an inspiring, heroic story. Brave men fighting the bigotry many of their own countrymen and the Nazis while armed only with antiquated aircraft. It sounds like the formula for a rousing tale, yet none of this dramatic tension appears on the screen. The dialog is contrived and inappropriate for the period. Military discipline and procedures are very inaccurately portrayed. The plethora of characters are either played as stereotypes or barely developed. From the unit's commander to the the evil enemy fighter pilot, there is no emotional depth to generate the viewer's interest. The flight sequences are occasionally interesting, but also seem fragmented and poorly paced. It is simply hard to generate any lasting enthusiasm for a movie in which the best sight is a P-51 Mustang and the best sound is a Merlin engine.",1353974400,,847,5.144927536231884

4752711,3,B005LAIGNC,"The acting in this movie was fair, although a little too over dramatic to serve it's message.

There were many more facets of the plot that were unfortunately left unexplored. The overall tone of the movie, was a very unflattering depiction of virtually all of the other armed service personnel as being openly racist, until later won by the integrity and valor of the core cast. It really was just one scene after another of how cruel, unsporting and how dismissive white people can be towards men of color.

I admire the dignity and respect the plight of the men depicted in the film, of course. However, this is basically a film that flatly attempts to illustrate once again, that people of color will triumph simply because they are people of color.",1353715200,,753,4.696969696969697
4752712,5,B005LAIGNC,I loved this film because it portrayed yet another division of the Tuskogee Airmen and this countries miscalculation due to racism on how good these flyers actually were. It could be empowering to young men and women to do their best and even if they are not recognized for a job well done to begin with; their time will come--they could be the very best and have high ranking persons name request them to do a job that will make everyone proud including the naysayers.,1353715200,2,469,4.529411764705882
4752713,2,B005LAIGNC,"I saw Red Tails in the theater. I've been a fan of works like Memphis Belle, Saving Private Ryan, Flags of Our Fathers, and other modern WW2 movies, and thus had great hopes for another historical docu-drama about the black fighter pilots of WW2.

Well, the cast and action scenes were great. I'm not going to pick over the historical accuracy of the combat scenes because, heck, real world combat rarely translates well into a good movie.

What bugged me - and your mileage may vary - was the plot, subplots, and dialogue of Red Tails. And I say this while being a fan of brainless action movies like Avatar, Terminator, and Predator, so it took a lot to hammer through my low standards. Red Tails took stellar actors and squandered them on the character-less characters (if that makes sense), trite dialogue, and poorly-constructed subplots. There's a love sub-plot that I could've completely believed, but the movie only delivered quick snapshots of a progression from first meeting to courtship that hardly explained how a black American Baptist airman managed to hook-up with an Italian Catholic woman in the bigoted 1940s. There was an alcoholism problem for one character that didn't come across well. Cuba Gooding, Jr., was squandered on a lifeless cookie-cutter officer who was a walking bundle of cliches (pipe smoking and lame motivational speeches). The white US officers who objected to the black pilots were also walking cliches.

For me, this movie did not measure up to the great WW2 movies of the past 20 years. It had all the makings of a great movie about the US's WW2 black airmen and their triumphs against bigotry (and Ze Germans, of course) but, instead, only delivered very amateurish final product.",1353628800,5,1723,4.914089347079038
4752714,4,B005LAIGNC,"This is the story of some very brave airmen, and a key segment of history; but the real point was that watching this preview convinced me to rent the actual feature.  Both are worth watching.",1353456000,,191,4.457142857142857
4752715,4,B005LAIGNC,"Red Tails is about the Tuskegee Airmen. Though it is well made, has lots of action and special effects, it somehow falls short of capturing the humanity of the men it honors. There is a bit of John Wayne ""sands of Iwo Jima"" bluster about it that didn't seem honest. This is the first film I know made about these heroes of WWII. I hope the next one allows them to be a bit more human as well. It IS worth seeing, though.",1353369600,2,420,4.072289156626506
4752716,4,B005LAIGNC,"I liked it.  Actually, I really, really liked 'Red Tails.'  I didn't know what to expect after reading the initial reviews following its theatrical release.  But then again, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls seemed to take an unfair critical drubbing, and I enjoyed that movie quite a lot (flaws and all). -- Red Tails is a war picture in the grand old tradition of war pictures.  I could easily see four clones of John Wayne starring in this movie (with a few Lee Marvins thrown in for good measure).  It is cleanly made and the two hours go by before you know it.  The aerial action is exciting and strangely reminiscent of the final space battles in both Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.  But as George Lucas financed this film himself (thank you, George) and had a hand in designing the aerial action, it is no surprise. -- Some criticism has been levelled at the film for not making more somber weight of the fact that the Tuskeegee airman were actual pilots and that they battled racism at just about every turn as they flew their way into history.  To some degree I guess I could agree with that, but the next time you watch Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra or Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments, let me know how much is historical accuracy and how much is up on the screen for sheer entertainment.  Red Tails is, almost throughout, a thrilling movie.  The four leads are very good in their roles (I can't remember the actors' names, but they play Joker, Easy, Lightning and Ray Gun ... all good characters).  Terrance Howard is especially awesome as Colonel Bullard, the man who fights racism in Washington while the pilots fight it in Europe.  In fact, all concerned are really good in a movie that is cleanly directed by Anthony Hemingway.  History is served just enough and the cliches are big and bold, just like an old-fashioned war movie should be.  This is a fine adventure picture and a worthy addition to the LucasFilm canon.",1353283200,,1975,4.573863636363637

4752960,5,B005LAIGNC,"George Lucas did an excellent job at bringing World War II history into the 21st century.  There are far too many films today that glorify war.  This is one that reminds us there was a chance, we as Americans may not have known our current way of life if not for the sacrifice of those before us.  This movie portrays the story of African-American fighter squadrons.  This is just one portion of the contributions that Americans of all races and religions made.  American Indians were known as code speakers because they could speak openly in their native language and not give away positions, plans or secrets.  Their language was known to no one else on earth.  Without the pilots from Tuskegee, Alabama flying in Europe the Americans could have lost the war in the air when the first jets in aviation history (ME-262) were introduced by the Luftwaffe.  It was faster than anything in the sky.  They probably had the ability to reach speeds nearing 600 mph. This group of pilots, known as the Red Tails were the ones to figure out how to shoot them down with the much slower North American P-51D which could barely reach 475 mph in a vertical dive, nearly ripping the wings off of it.  The code speakers in the pacific are what saved American troops from being slaughtered on the ground against Japan. Again, without this group there was a good chance that battle would have been lost.  The price Asian-Americans payed simply because Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.  Yet, again another minority group of Americans that formed their own platoons and battalions and fought harder than other troops, to prove they were behind the American flag.  African-American ground troops were sent to Scandinavia because of the extreme cold temperature.  The people of those countries remember that it was those troops that repelled multiple attempts by Hitler to take over that portion of the world.  Not once did Hitler's army have a foot hold there.  The total contribution the people of color gave to this country has always managed to be suppressed or only told in bits and pieces.  Without them, this country would have another language and it wouldn't be Spanish.  This movie? Five Stars!",1349481600,,2178,4.809139784946237

mediocre WW2 movies. But most of them were low budget indie movies. Therefore

Well, Mr. Lucas managed to achieve an even lower quality by wasting a lot of
money. The acting (and uttering of the atrocious dialogue) could be done better
by any reenactment group.  The arial compact scenes might look impressive at first
but are absolutely unrealistic.

And the story line is the WW2 equivalent of a cheap Italian softporn movie.
Cutboard characters (bad white officers, good black soldiers, evil Nazi Germans),
implausible events (shortest captivity ever, Pilot taking multiple 30mm rounds
before dying, P51 being nearly as fast as the ME262 etc.).

I also don't like it when a scene is used over and over again (as in some of the battle scenes) except they flipped the scene vertically or zoomed in on a smaller aspect of the same scene. In other words it looked fake.

The non-action scenes of the movie were almost painful. I tend to blame it on the script because I've seen some of the actors in other things and I know they can act better than this. The story line was predictable. The lines and the characters were cliche. And the actors were wooden caricatures.

4753249,3,B005LAIGNC,"Red Tails, 2012 film

This movie was inspired by true events. It starts in the air war over Europe where P-51 fighters escort B-17 bombers. Some fighters are distracted by decoys so the main force of enemy fighters attack the bombers and shoot them down. Next four obsolete P-40s fly over Italy in 1944. One attacks a truck on a highway, then they attack a steam locomotive train. They return to base and read the news. There is a discussion in the Pentagon about this unit. The talk tells about the conditions. One pilot visits a local family. The pilots talk about combat. ""Operation Shingle"" will place them in support of a beach landing. They approach enemy fighters and fire on them. Four follow a fighter to attack an enemy airfield and destroy ME-109s on the ground. The colonel needs fighter escorts for the B-17s to reduce losses.

One pilot visits the officer's club and starts a fight. A DC-3 brings a colonel with news of new P-51 fighters for their group. Lt. Joe Little rejoins his unit. The Colonel explains why bombers must be defended. Their new fighters will have red tails (for easy identification). They begin to escort a hundred bombers through flak. This time no bombers are lost. One pilot is wounded. Another attacks a war ship. One plane crash lands. A captured pilot is sent to a POW camp. Film cameras recorded the attacks on that war ship. Bomber flyers thank them. They are warned about the German jet planes. The prisoners plan an escape from the POW camp. They will attack a tank factory on the outskirts of Berlin. The Red Tails will fly the first leg. But their replacement does not show up. ME-262's attack the mission with their faster speed. But the P-51's shoot them down (and take casualties).

They stay ""on mission"". Sophia gets the bad news. The Colonel talks to his men. The captured pilot returns alive. The Distinguished Unit Citation is given to the 332nd fighter group. They received 90 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Sixty were killed in action. The credits at the end thank the Czech Construction Crew. Production services provided by the Croatia Unit, and filmed at Prague Studios ; also Italy and Slovenia. This is worth watching once but it could have used a better script or story. ""Flyboys"" or ""The Battle of Britain"" were better movies.

""Double Victory"" provides a history of the war from the viewpoint of African-Americans. The 1925 War College Report shows the attitudes of that era. The P-51 was the most advanced propeller-driven fighter in the war. The life expectancy of a fighter pilot was 15 to 22 missions. The ME-262 fighter was 100 mph faster than the P-51, but were shot down by P-51s (and Spitfires and Typhoons).

The main criticism I have of the film is that sometimes the characters fall into some simple roles, with Cuba Gooding acting like an understudy of Douglas MacArthur, a captain that struggles with drink, a young pilot struggling for acceptance by his peers, and the hotshot gloryhound that has to do some growing up.

However, Terrence Howard is superb as the leading Colonel, and the film adequately conveys the suspense and risks of the fighters, ultimately leading to triumph over both the Nazis and the prejudice of other soldiers at home and abroad.

On one of the island Pacific battles the Marines were short of men and asked the Black truck drives to volunteer to fight on the front lines and the volunteers did such a good job the Marines who they fought with would take on anyone who spoke down to them.

If you want to see George Lucas' attempt to bring Jar Jar into the middle of WW2, buy this. The racism and struggles these brave men had to go through was treated like a sick joke.

In every possible way, this movie stinks. From the CGI plane battles to the shallow story to the bad acting.

The good guys are good, and bad guys are bad. The dialogue is corny but to the point. Unfortunately, many people, seeing that the movie was about the Tuskegee airmen, have held the movie to the standard of a historical drama, but it isn't that at all.

4753664,5,B005LAIGNC,"Cuba Gooding Jr., David Oyelowo, Nate Parker, and Terrence Howard star in this great movie about the famed Tuskegee Airmen.  The Tuskegee Airmen were an all-negro unit.  Thus, they were relegated to second-rate aircraft and flew missions of little importance.  But, due to the efforts of Colonel Bullard (Howard), the Tuskegee Airman soon found themselves at the forefront of the air war over Europe.

The Tuskegees were given the opportunity to fly bomber escort.  The caveat was that they were to remain close to the bombers throughout the mission.  Given brand-new P-51 Mustangs, the Tuskegee Airmen soon made a name for themselves with both the grateful bomber crews and the German pilots.

This is an excellent movie.  I originally saw it in the theater and I bought the DVD copy.  The acting is very good, and David Oyelowo (Lightning), Nate Parker (Easy), Terrence Howard (Colonel Bullard), and Cuba Gooding Jr. all give fine performances.  The special effects and air combat scenes are what make this movie so good.  It was thrilling to watch the B-17s, P-51s, and ME-109s fighting it out.  The other action scenes, including the attack on the German train and air base are exciting as well.

4753783,3,B005LAIGNC,"How do you rate a film you really want to like but has many short comings? I'll keep it simple.

This is a story that really needed to  be told. In the past, the story of the Tuskegee airmen usually revolves around the early days of the struggle to be recognized and accepted. This film does that, especially in the accompanying documentary.  However the film also depicts the actual wartime experiences of these brave pioneers of African-American civil rights. The aerial sequences are astoundingly good as is the portrayal of aerial combat. The war in Italy in 1944 is realistically depicted. So is Army Air Force pilot life. People interested in World War II military history and USAF vets (I am one) will treasure the depiction of the men and aircraft in this film. You will wonder how the producers managed to get so many working WWII planes and you will struggle to tell the difference between the CGI aircraft and the real ones. The only sour note in this film is the cliche ridden dialogue and inane chatter between the pilots. However I have been around real real military aircrews to know that some of these verbal groaners actually do occur, but to place so many in a motion picture takes the viewers attention away from the story.

Watch this film for the excellent photography and ignore the cornball script.",1344038400,,1321,4.705627705627705

4753785,3,B005LAIGNC,"For what it is, generally good. There are considerably worse depictions. Shows a part of WWII history about which little is generally known by the public at large. Tends to be glossed over in many areas after having read what histories are available on the subject, but is generally true to what occured overall.

The focus on a few men involved in this part of the Tuskegee Airmen's role in the air war over Germany is to be expected, but the true intensity of their efforts to be an active part of the war and their deadly involvement therein is lacking. A good story, but just that - a simple story. A bit maudlin in places, which could have been avoided by better scripting.

The best aspects of the DVD are depictions of the conditions and equipment that were in existence during the times of the war. Some of the computer graphics utilized leave a good deal to be desired - much too realistic to have been shot by gun cameras and the like of the time, or now for that matter, and, as a result, tend to be ""cartoonish."" Overall, however, film reasonably well done and accurate as to equipment.

The Red Tails film seems aimed at those with little interest or conception of either flying, combat flying in World War Two, or reality. The Red Tails knock out 63 German planes on the ground in 5 minutes on their first action in Italy.  Five minutes because that is all the fuel they have left. Then they do acrobatics over their own field before landing. At that rate, give them an hour of fuel and they could have destroyed the entire Luftwaffe. The fact is during the entire war the Tuskegee airmen destroyed 150 German aircraft on the ground, a fine record, but it took nearly two years.  Then the potentially suspenseful scene of the Red Tail coming home with a fuel soaked plane is 'talked in' but never told to cut his engine.  He seems to hit the runway at full throttle. You can't land a plane at full throttle, and with a bad fuel leak, you would glide in on final with switch off, so the electronics don't ignite the fuel.

There has never been a group of airmen that have been given the amount of filmstock as have the black pilots that made up this squadron. One would think that they alone defeated the Luftwaffe. For goodness sake anyone in that theater of war flying the later model P51 would have met with great success against the relatively obsolete aircraft that the Luftwaffe fielded in the latter part of the war (with the rare exception of the Germans superb jet aircraft that simply arrived too late and in too few numbers to ""turn the tide"" toward the Germans in the air.
The Germans also suffered from the massive loss of experienced pilots during the last couple of years of the Great War because of idiotic war policies created by politicians rather than military men, much like the United States has done in every conflict we have been engaged in since 1945. Politicians cannot even master politics much less handle the complexities of warfare and the results always prove that fact.
This movie is just another PC rehash of a tired story of one group of pilots. It seems that roughly every 5 years someone gets together enough funding to tell the same story about the same group again and again and always with the same result. Dismal box office figures because nobody wants to watch essentially re-runs.

The love angle was typical but the sadness was there also. Over all I would recommed this movie to any war buff and especially ones interested in air battles.

4754345,2,B005LAIGNC,"2-stars for being a poor, but not un-watchable, aerial combat movie. I was strongly tempted to deduct a star for bad treatment of Tuskegee Airmen's story, but that didn't seem fair since Hollywood routinely ignores the compelling elements of a story in favor of a distorted, hackneyed,formulaic treatment.

1. Failure as an aerial combat movie:
Anyone who has seen even a modest amount of actual WW2 aerial combat footage will alternate between a series of negative emotions: derisive laughter, groaning, and anger at being treated so contemptuously by this movie's makers. The CGI is heavily influenced by the style and technique of first-person-shooter videogames, but it is so over-the-top visually that any serious gamer would reject it as cartoonish -- lacking any sense of realism. Particularly absurd, the movie treats steel, including armor plating, as having the same explosive potential as vaporized gasoline -- one .50-cal bullet hits it and there is a towering fireball. And the tactics swing between nonsense and hilariously stupidity (but one should know not to expect better from George Lucas).

The only faintly realistic part of the movie is that it treats the Germans as the same cartoonish, wooden villains as did the propaganda comic books of that era.

2. Failure as a story of the Tuskegee Airmen:

The movie fails to give any sense of the importance of their accomplishments (instead citing medals). The movie shows a bomber crew offering to buy drinks for some Red Tails, as a casual ""nice job"" acknowledgement. This trivializes what happened. The Red Tails so excelled as escorts that bomber groups lobbied hard to have them assigned to their missions. And their reputation became such that their mere presence produced a substantial boost to the morale of the bomber crews. Without effective fighter escort, the bombing campaign would have been severely limited -- the costs of many targets would have been prohibitive. The movie presents the Red Tails as reducing the number of bomber crews killed, instead of them enabling those bombers to deliver heavy blows to the German war machine.

The challenges the Tuskegee Airmen faced are only lightly touched upon: With only a few trivial modifications to the script, this movie could have had an all-white cast. The biggest failing is that the movie gives no sense of how this experience turned the elite of the Negro community -- many of the pilots qualified for the military program because of pilot training in a civilian program at Tuskegee University -- into part of the elite of American society. What the movie shows is generic ""frat boy"" behavior, but when you listen to the accounts of the actual pilots what you hear is how aware they were of the importance of what they were doing and the disastrous effects if they failed. And of the habits of focus, discipline and toughness it reinforced that served them so well later.

The movie lacks any of the foreshadowing of the important people that many of these pilots would become. The DVD's extras include interviews with some of the airmen, but I didn't notice it covering anything I hadn't already seen elsewhere. Plus, ""extras"" are supposed to be that, rather than (partially) remedial for the failings of the primary product (the feature movie).

The romance in it is downright STUPID.  Yes I've said that bad word.  Contrite as it can be.  Sure you take your black butt and fly over a white woman's house in Italy.  Find her residence somehow.  Don't speak her language not even one word and see if she and her mom fall in love with you then or now.  If this is historically how black troops were treated (and yes I know full well Europe sometimes treated black men and women better than the US) I need more convincing than this cartoonish version here provides.

The best actor in it was bright faced young Tristan Wilds who lights up every scene he's been in since The Wire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire-The-Complete-Series/dp/B005NFJAWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;where he was amazing and if he were white his name would be as familiar as McCauley's was back in the day.  Talk about talent.  Unfortunately Lucas uses him in only about half the film leaving the standard list of black veteran male actors do act about like they have in every other film the same names have been in. Do they think we don't recall how they portray a character from one performance to another?

Pretty Eyes Terence Howard, was just pretty.

You have a team of pilots living at a time of extreme bigotry and the film does nothing to show you how on earth they even learned to fly.

You have relatively high ranking black military men and there again the film does nothing to tell you how on earth they achieved the levels of power they possessed.

You have white officials who are FOR not against Negroes (the term for that time) but the movie doesn't give a clue how those beings came to be the way they were.

I heard Terence wax on glowingly exalting the cinematography.  Is he kidding?  Unless you do have theatre sized screens the planes, the Red Tails then the upgraded bomber vs German plains are way too undifferentiated in rapid motion for the eyes to even tell who's successfully shooting whom. I was lost especially in the opening scene.  Even if it meant the props had to be historically incorrect, the planes that belonged to the U.S. needed to be striking so that our eyes could accurately follow the action on screens less than 40"" in size.

Really?  100 million?

If you just want to very lightly introduce the issues these men faced to a very young audience then this movie would have been appropriate but as the go to THE WHOLE UNTOLD STORY type of movie on the subject, which is, I thought this director was promising, its pales and fails drastically.

The old style WWII movies that use actual airplanes and fotage are gone.  What we have now are computerized versions.
In this movie, when the B 17's begin drop their bombs, they hold steady altitude.  That's because they're computerized.  In WWII, when bombers dropped their bombs, they would suddenly gain altitude after losing the weight of the bombs (look at any old actual fotage to see for yourself).

I was glad to see another movie based on airplane combat about WWII made.  But these days, movies are so unrealistic and Hollywood garbage.  Compare the part in this movie where the Tuskegee airmen attack a German airbase and the scene where the Japanese attack an American airbase in Pearl Harbor in the movie Tora, Tora, Tora! and tell me we're going backwards or forward in movie quality with action scenes.

4754516,1,B005LAIGNC,"The first thing you should know regarding the new WWII aviation melodrama ""Red Tails"" is that if you haven't seen the movie, but have seen the trailer, then you have already seen ""Red Tails"". That's right, the movie is nothing more than a two hour extension of the three minute trailer. The film consists of nothing more than a lot of CGI aerial dogfights, no character development, little historical reference, and absolutely nothing engaging.

The movie, executive produced by effects guru George Lucas, begins in mid-battle and never seems to land, there is no attempt to set up a story. The characters are interchangeable, the dialogue painful to hear, it's right out of the cliched WWII efforts of the actual era. The movie never has a thought or a point to make, the historical elements are quickly glanced over like cliff notes, the picture barely touches on the key racial elements of the pilots conflict with the American air force.

Everything about this movie is a mess, even the casting is all wrong. The usually reliable Terence Howard is miscast, too soft spoken and polite too really grab the audience, or the men under his command for that matter, by the throat and drill into them the cause that they are working towards. There needs to be something more invested in this movie by the filmmakers if they have any hope of getting the audience into this flick. It doesn't even successfully pander to the audience.

It is interesting to note that Cuba Gooding, Jr. appears in both of these films, he was also in Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" which is the movie that ""Red Tails"" most resembles.

4754521,2,B005LAIGNC,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie and was really disappointed.  I had such high hopes for this movie that the let down was partly because the movie was so poorly directed.  I was most offended by the producer/director using 1940's jive talking and making these great air men look like idiots.  If it hasn't had subtitles, it would have been difficult to understand the actors. I am white and I respect the Tuskeegee air men who finally had their chance to make a difference during World War II.  I can't help but wonder how these good actors felt delivering these corny out dated lines; they must have been offended as well.  The Tuskeegee air men were a credit to our country, their race, all their awards earned and they deserved to be recognized as the excellent air men that they were.",1339718400,,801,4.534722222222222

At no time did it give any of the history behind the ""experiment"" that was conducted.  The dialogue was pathetic.  The worst acting I've seen by Cuba and Terrence.

George Lucas needs his butt kicked and this so called director would do better directing Sesame Street in Pakistan.  The air scenes were good but that's about it.  Keep your money in your pocket.",1339718400,7,614,4.371681415929204

4754566,3,B005LAIGNC,"I'm going to address the Blu ray version of this film as I had not seen it in the theaters when it was released.  The best thing about the disc isn't the theatrical film itself but ""Double Victory: The Tuskegee Airmen at War,""  the 1 hour documentary ""extra.""  While the theatrical film addresses some of the history of the courageous Tuskegee airmen, the documentary focuses of the ""second war"" back in the United States.  Using excellent interviews with many of the survivors of the Red Tails and their African-American bomber crew confederates, many of the injustices they lived through are fleshed out.  They are supplemented by some remarkable film footage from the time.  These great Americans effectively launched the Civil Rights movement even before Jackie Robinson integrated baseball or Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat.

The next best thing about this film is the aerial combat photography, some of which is done with real planes and real pilots and some is done with some amazing CGI and George Lucas's technicians.  I was especially taken with the introduction of some early German jet fighters as they engaged the Red Tails' P-51 Mustangs.  The other big positive is the magnificent transfer to Blu ray.  From the opening scenes the film sparkles in this Lucas authorized release.  The colors are bright and vivid.  The textures are finely tuned, especially in close ups.  The audio likewise is demo ready.  As you might expect, the audio is an important feature with planes shooting at each other all over the Italian and German skies.  In addition to the aforementioned documentary, other extras include comments by Lucas and director Anthony Hemingway, composer Terrance Blanchard and the cast.  There is also a 5 minute feature at how the CGI came into play.  The film and the extras are in 1080p with the film shown in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

Unfortunately the film itself isn't so good.  While the actors in key roles are fine, some of the secondary actors come off like bumpkins or amateurs.  Of course some of the cornball dialog they are given is equally bad.  In a few sequences when the Red Tails are escorting bombers flown by a white crew, the bomber pilots make some of the most ridiculous comments that I had to laugh.  I don't know if this was done intentionally or not but it comes across as just dumb.  There are also a couple scenes with the black pilots that slang terms and pronunciations are spoken that were not used in 1944.  What is important is that this story got visibility with this film.  It could have been better.",1339372800,64,2609,4.767857142857143
4754567,3,B005LAIGNC,"This is a half baked effort to depict the true heroism and sacrifice of the Tuskegee airmen of WWII fame. The story is great and the heroism is there but the rest of the story/movie is way over the top. As someone who has had the honour of meeting former Tuskegee airmen I can tell you that I am deeply disappointed in how little thought must have been given to producing and making this motion picture. So many errors and technical glitches plus an array of make-believe fibs that don't fit in the real story of those men. In one scene, the white bomber pilot praises black fighters for their good job over 'Polesti' which he must have meant 'Ploesti' in Romania. Then there is a scene on top of the ATC tower where the black sgt. says 'Roger that, sir' which is not how troops responded to orders in 1940s. 'Roger' is a modern mil-speak invention. I might be wrong on that so feel free to correct me. Then there is the unnecessary romance cliche. Do they want us to believe this BS? One has to take the aerial dogfight scenes with a grain of salt. The B-17 wouldn't have had structural failures like those shown in the movie just after a few hits. It would have taken a lot more to bring down a 'Fort'. It is nauseating that the film makers decided to show white fighter pilots as cowards in the first few scenes. And I object to that.

The characters are stock movie fashion, the solemn leader, the hot shot, the joker and the rookie. It's obvious that no research was really done and the dialog is laughable at best.

He made a good story with great effects terrible. THe acting was either over the top or deep in muck. I wish it had more weapon facts in it. The music score seemed almost silly, and louder than it should be. THe last scene when the planes went guns blazing at each other was ridiculas. If any type of WW2 Historian was used , they should have taken him to the woods as well. Being brought up by my Grandparents i got to hear so much of the war and took to reading a lot of it, THe ME 262 was a plane out of the league of any prop plane in that era. I hate to burst anyones bubble , but i cant fanthom that in the movies scence with them, they were all shot down so easily. THe Jets had 30mm cannons! and shot from far to escape the range of the 12.7mm machine guns that the allies used. they would sweep down make a past , fly past make a turn and do it again at 500MPH , at that time nothing could catch them. The ME 262 suffered from mechcanical problems and they were shot down mostly by pure luck and having engine problems. If the germans had not introduced this fighter so late in the war it would have changed the tide of the airwar but not the ground where PAtton did the finest job in history.
PS only top german ace piots flew these and would have shot from way out if they wanted to play chicken.
even though this movie was emphasizing on racism during the 40's which was entirely correct, and which all AMericans should be ashamed of. This movie was just so poorly scripted i concentrated more on the planes than anything else.

4754572,1,B005LAIGNC,"Leave WWII to Spielberg Lucus, This has to be one of the worst moderately budgeted movies I have EVER had the displeasure to press play on. This movie is so bad is makes George Lucus's Howard The Duck look like a master piece. let me start by first saying I come from a very large military family. My uncle was a colonel for the Army Air corp in WWII, and my other uncle Was a 101st paratrooper who fought and was captured during the battle of the Bulge. I have great respect for the men and woman of WWII, especially the Tuskegee airmen. This movie makes a mockery of it all.

When the film started, right from the first scene, the dialogue was so cheesy and bad, I thought it was mimicking a comic book. any minute I was wating for the screen to turn to pages as a kid read them. It showed a ""evil"" looking German pilot with a malicious grin as he shot up B-17's. Then you see an American pilot say ""Germans! lets get em!"" and they leave the bombers....It gets far worse from there. Nope, not a kids imagination...it kept going, this was the movie! In fact...the movie is so bad, and I am so frustrated, I hit pause on it right now, and am writing this review with it still on my screen.

The moving is so over the top and melodramatic I just about turned it off. Its that bad. I feel so cheated on this movie. In fact, in honor of the men who fought and died in the air war over Europe, I'm straight up insulted. It's full of cheesy dialogue that makes an elementary school play look like Broadway, and the constant racism rhetoric in the movie just adds to the overall feeling of an agenda based movie being shoved down your throat with no other attention given to detail. It's as if Lucus wanted to make a point so bad, he forgot how to  make a film. There is nothing wrong with the message, but delivery is everything and this falls way short of what you should expect from a large budget film. Fact is,Lucus had a very hard time getting this film off the ground. He could not find anyone in Hollywood to back it, and then went on the record in interviews claiming that the reason his movie ""Red Tails"" was having trouble was because ""Hollywood was racists"". He stated the following:

""This has been held up for release since 1942 since it was shot, I've been trying to get released ever since,"" said Lucas half-jokingly to Jon Stewart on the Daily Show on Monday night. ""It's because it's an all-black movie. There's no major white roles in it at all. I showed it to all of them and they said, 'No. We don't know how to market a movie like this.'

yes George....that must be it, its because of the all black cast. It couldn't possibly be that the script was horrible and your movie sucked? The Tuskegee airmen were great men who did wonderful things for the nation. This story deserves a serious movie, not a slap knee joke this film turned out to be. I felt like I was watching a kids cartoon with dialogue this bad.

I had high hopes for this film, however I was let down. Fact is, 27,000 Airman of WWII perished, more then that of all Marines lost during WWII. Think about that.... The air war was very terrifying and brutal. Hardly the tongue and cheek scam this movie is. If you want to see a decent movie about the air war, watch Memphis Bell from the 90's. If you want to see the real grit of it, watch WWII in HD The AIR WAR.

Cuba Gooding does not have a significant role in this movie, which was a letdown for me.  The action scenes are good; the flight sequences and dogfight scenes are well choreographed and produced.  The movie seems a remake of Tuskegee Airmen and definitely not an improvement.  The plot is loose; there's not much of a build to any sort of climax and at the two-hour mark (approximately), the movie ends.  The only wrap-up is a series of written FYIs exactly like Tuskegee Airmen.

What makes this such a tear jerker is that all of these guys fought and died for a country that still didn't accept them as men at the time. I just want to thank them for their courage in the face of two enemies and Steven for the courage to put out a movie about them. The movie was good. I felt like I was really up there flying and the effect were top notch. This was not the best movie I've ever seen and could have been better in some ways but I've seen a whole lot worse produced. I cared about these guys and when they finally were invited by the bomber crews to have drinks because of the lives they saved and the quip about you call us colored just had me ROTFLMAO so true.

I have been looking forward for it to come out on Blu-ray since I honestly cannot stay awake in the movies anymore for any movie.  One thing I would like to know is why in the world do I have to buy a Blu-ray, DVD and sometimes a Digital Disk, when all I want is the Blu-ray.  I've noticed that on almost every new release, you have to buy the pricey 2 or 3 digit version.  I now buy very few Blu-rays and when the movie isn't an action or big CG movie, I'll drop down and buy it on DVD or wait it out to buy the Blu-rays when they pop the price down to 9.99 because nobody wants to pay 25 - 30 dollars for the movie.  So whenever I see a movie that I cannot buy as a single Blu-ray, it will get 1 star from me for that alone.  Now about the movie again, as some of you mentioned, the movie in 1995 ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" is well worth the watch.

4754702,1,B005LAIGNC,"Against my better judgement, I saw this in the theater and my wife had to keep squeezing my hand to keep me from shouting out ""oh come on!"" countless times.  As others have stated, this movie is absolute historical fantasy - there is NOTHING historically accurate in this movie except that the U.S. did have black pilots and they did participate in WWII - aside from that, pretty much everything in the movie is absolute rubbish.

The story is BAD, the acting is BAD, the computer graphic work is HORRIBLE, and the script may very well be the WORST bit of work ever written about the American Air Force in WWII.  The technical advisor on this movie must've been Lady Gaga.

These guys deserve a much better movie than this - this is absolutely painful to watch if you know anything at all about WWII or aviation in general.  The events portrayed in this film DID NOT happen, 98% of what is shown is pure fiction.  Somebody should do a good quality movie about these men.  The made-for-television version done years ago, as poorly done as it was, was infinitely better than this.  If you think ""300"" is an accurate depiction of the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopale, then you'll likely think this movie is historically accurate too.

4754827,4,B005LAIGNC,"Finally saw Red Tails. Overall, I genuinely liked it. If someone asks me, I'd recommend it. But it did let me down, as a fan of war films in general (who has probably seen too many of them) and for the reasons I feared - poor dialogue writing, and directing that is concerned more about the special effects than the characters.

It was kind of done more in the style of the old 1940s WWII movies, like John Wayne's The Flying Leathernecks (1951) so if we can ignore everything we've learned about war film-making over the past 50 years, it's a really great movie. I thought that the cast absolutely saved this from being an awful movie - the script was terrible (especially the first 30 minutes) and while the action sequences were good, the plot would have been completely forgettable if it wasn't for the drama of some of the scenes with Terence Howard and Cuba Gooding, Jr., which on their own were worth sitting through the first 30 minutes to get to. If it was in black and white and made back in 1949, it'd be considered a classic movie today. If the writing was better, it'd be an updated version of another good but Hollywood-ish WWII air war flick, Memphis Belle (1990).

However since it is actually 2012, and we have learned a lot about the art of making war films in the past 50 years, I'd much rather have seen (which someone still could make) a more serious treatment of this really compelling story. Either in the high drama, character-driven style of A Few Good Men (1992), Men of Honor (2000), because surely this cast was strong enough to pull that off with better writing and directing, or in the hyper-realism style of We Were Soldiers (2002), Black Hawk Down (2001), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Band of Brothers (2001).

So bottom line - if it wasn't for the actual story of these heroic men being so compelling, and if it wasn't for the acting of Terence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr (along with the rest of the cast) overcoming the sub-par writing and directing, this would have been the black version of Windtalkers (2002, a truly awful war film). As it stands, it's a throwback to an older style of war movie-making (intentionally or not) and if your expectations are low, you'll be pleasantly surprised, as I was.

Great men of history, passionately portrayed by some very fine actors, trapped in a mediocre screenplay. 4 stars because it's an important story and it's an entertaining movie despite its flaws.",1338681600,3,2433,4.612009237875289
4754828,2,B005LAIGNC,"We went into this expecting more considering all the positive reviews on Amazon, but although the action sequences were good, the dialogue was wooden, as if they were reading off of cue cards. As other reviewers have mentioned this often dampened the action scenes. Also, I find it hard to believe that a serviceman of ANY color could disregard a direct order while flying a mission, engage single-handedly in brawls in an all-white bar, or fly off-mission (again disobeying orders) without being severely disciplined. The character ""Lightning"" did all of this and merely got a light tongue-lashing. As much grief as the ""colored"" airmen endured from the white society of that time this doesn't seem believable. Add to that a scene where one lone fighter plane sunk a battleship without dropping any bombs, only using bullets in a strafing run, or another scene where Germany used jet fighter planes to attack the slower moving bomber planes (even though NO jet planes were used in combat in that war, they were still in the experimental stages. Look it up.) I guess they felt the need to sensationalize the movie. I couldn't help comparing this movie to Memphis Belle, which had more character development and was  more believable.

4754833,2,B005LAIGNC,"In fulfilling his career dream to create a Hollywood epic in tribute to a group of men who deserve tribute, George Lucas succumbed to the pull of Hollywood clich to instead render a computer graphic cartoon of legendary men!  As a retired USAF pilot, I understand how airplanes fly, but mostly I understand how men perform in aerial combat operations.  Trivial, even jovial discussions on the formation radio, such as repeatedly shown in this movie, were simply not done.  For many reasons this is true, but principally because the radio was a tool for mission success.  Survival and basic air discipline required that the radio be used to support the mission.  The sort of bravado talk these actors carried out in the air was reserved for after the mission and after the debriefing, when the pilots assembled in the bar.

I could have forgiven this as an artistic license, but to reveal a squadron commander who routinely drank alcohol immediately before flying a sortie, and an ace pilot who routinely disobeyed orders and questioned his commander on the formation radio, was simply too much to bear!  It was a travesty carried out upon men who above all else were professional officers.  Their senior commanders would never have tolerated such lapses in discipline.  While it may have fit Lucas' desire for drama, it rendered his movie a hugely disappointing effort!

Movie critics have panned the film for these reasons -- rightfully so.  But, as someone who grew up loving aviation and who studied aviation history with intense personal interest, and admired the true story of the Tuskegee Airmen, I was profoundly disappointed with this movie.  Lucas had a once in a lifetime opportunity to translate his enviable Hollywood clout and resources into a movie that had the courage to resist the Hollywood ""treatment."" He could have rendered a movie fit to be mentioned in the same breath as ""The Longest Day,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or even the HBO mini-series, ""Band of Brothers.""  None of these three classic movies lacked for drama and interest, but they certainly did not sacrifice essential elements of truth and accuracy to achieve it.  ""Band of Brothers"" in particular struck a perfect chord by telling the real story, and validated that the real story carries more than enough drama to hold an audience's interest.  Lucas merely needed the courage to tell the real story, and of all people in Hollywood, he had the influence to ensure the real story was the only one told.  The failure to do this is entirely his own!

The men of the Tuskegee Airmen deserved better!  George Lucas made it clear he intended this movie to be a tribute, and one must take him at his word.  Tragically for him, and disappointingly for us, the only aspect of this movie that is epic is the epic failure!  Lucas aimed to create a masterpiece in keeping with the immortal men who flew and fought with such skill as to earn praise from those who know best their actual exploits.  If only he had!",1338508800,,2982,4.807843137254902
4754834,1,B005LAIGNC,"I waited a long time to get this movie and I am very disappointed with it. The dialog is downright silly. Fighter pilots jabbering at each other in the middle of combat? I don`t think so. The screenwriter didn't have a clue about the relationship between the crew chief, an enlisted man,and the pilot, an officer. The crew chief would never speak to the pilot in the way depicted. Clich after clich after clich. So poorly done. Computer graphics galore mostly unbelievable.

4755005,2,B005LAIGNC,"If you have watched ""Tuskegee Airmen"" already, you will be disappointed with Red Tails.  It covers the same period and group of men in history but in a typical Hollywood treatment of historical fact like they did with ""Pearl Harbor"". A great war movie has been turned into a love story and soppy emotional display of 1970s social worker style approach to counselling officers in the military during combat. In this new version the most important and insightful part of the story was left completely out. The facts of how these intelligent men overcame their own prejudices in basic training while in Tuskegee, Alabama, were left completely out of this version of the movie and that was the part of the storie which held the rest of the wartime accomplishments  up as belienvable attitudes.

The true facts of the accomplishements performed by these real live heroic African/Americans exceed any  imaginary heroic enhancements Hollywood could manufacture to improve their characters. The truth of this story is totally disclosed in the first movie and left nothing unsaid about all difficulties encountered as young men worked twice as hard to get into flight training and even harder to finish it. It is a story of all they went through to achieve their own personal goals of becoming pilots.

This factually based storie follows the same perspective used by the director of Pearl Harbor. Why does H'Wood have to ruin a perfectly good historical script by turning it into a love story? They treated this factual account of brave men overcoming fears of prejudice and bigotry back home while facing death in the skys over Europe as if was a Saturday matinee.

4755006,3,B005LAIGNC,"A decidedly old-fashioned chronicle of the Tuskegee Airmen - one of producer George Lucas' pet projects dating back to the time of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy - is a bit rough around the edges in terms of its story, yet visually at least, ""Red Tails"" is a compelling production from Lucasfilm and director Anthony Hemingway.

Nate Parker, David Oyelowo, Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelly portray members of the African-American combat unit assigned to the skies over Italy in 1944. Their battles in the air and on the ground, fighting discrimination, are given a basic treatment in John Ridley and Aaron McGruder's script, which is chock full of war-movie cliches and predictable dramatic situations. When the film takes flight, however - in a series of brilliantly choreographed and spectacularly animated dog battles from ILM - ""Red Tails"" manages to be sufficiently engaging. Lucas shot ""Red Tails"" fairly inexpensively in the Czech Republic and had a couple of outside vendors work in conjunction with ILM to produce its digital effects, but you'd never know it from the end result, since from a technical angle, the picture is impressively mounted, believably rendering its aerial combat and overall production scale.

Overall, because of its unevenness and paper-thin characterizations, ""Red Tails"" is certainly not a great film by any means (and both Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Terence Howard are mostly wasted in supporting roles), but at least it's superior to ""Radioland Murders.""

Fox's Blu-Ray of ""Red Tails"" is gorgeous in both its AVC encoded 1080p transfer and DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack - no surprise with Ben Burtt having assembled the audio. Unfortunately, Terence Blanchard's score is an almost complete failure, lacking strong themes and failing to give the inherently dramatic story the musical backing it deserved. Light extra features include a documentary on the Tuskegee Airmen and a number of featurettes on Hemingway, Blanchard, George Lucas and the cast, plus a standard DVD copy.",1338422400,,1992,5.238244514106583

Hollywood does its thing and inserts some romantic and implied sex. I fell in love with P51 Mustang back in days of WWII.

I was very excited to watch a movie of LUCAS (epic) proportions based on the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American USAAF servicemen during World War II.

The scenery and air scenes were awesome.  There were some touching moments.

The bad:
It felt like the writers wished they were allowed to use a narrator and instead had random people say awkward lines just to slam the viewer in the face with perfectly obvious statements.  This made the film lose its magic.

Great stories show you their heart, this story had the potential.  Instead the movie told you its message, again and again, and often using deadpan dubbed sounding voices.",1338336000,,787,4.644927536231884

4755013,4,B005LAIGNC,"A very large squadron of flying fortress bombers is crossing Europe with a fighter escort.  A small handful of German fighters strafe the bombers and the American fighter pilots all takeoff in pursuit to shoot down the Germans. The decoy worked as the balance of the German fighters come in and easily shoot down many of the bombers who are not without fighter plane protection.

The Tuskegee Airmen are stationed in Italy in 1944 and their duties include flying patrols and shooting the random military transport they happen to find.  They long for real action at the front and the opportunity for air to air combat with the Germans.  They are perceived by the top brass to be an experiment and incompetent soldiers who are given older style P40 planes to use only for political reasons.

Colonel A. J. Howard is at the Pentagon arguing with his superiors that the men deserve a fighting chance to prove themselves in real battle but he is running against racial prejudice and egos....

This is a full on action war film that has some really good air battles in it that are worth viewing.  The storyline is just OK and the acting is in my opinion very good.  Unfortunately many of the historical facts are twisted and the characters in the film are fictional.  The story of the Tuskegee airmen is a true story of some of the heroes of WWII.  What I didn't like were the depictions of:
* A pilot almost asleep in the cockpit while flying a mission.
* A Captain leader who is a drunk and goes into every battle after drinking.
* A Lieutenant who didn't follow orders multiple times.
* Showing fighter pilots abandoning bomber squadrons so they can get a kill and allow bomber crews to die unprotected.
There were other items but these are creative writing in the script that could have been done without.

Nevertheless there is enough truth in the movie that allows it to be seen and tell of the bravery of these men who fought for their country.  At the end of the movie it states:
* They all get the distinguished Presidential Unit Citation for performance against the enemy.

* The Tuskegee airmen had one of the best records of any air fighter group in WW II. By the end of the war, 66 were killed in action.

The movie sold fewer tickets at the box office that it cost to make.  It was totally financed by George Lucas as he could get no funding from Hollywood for a movie with a primarily black cast.  Lucas also gave a generous grant donation to the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. to create a website honoring the pilots.  If you would like more information you should go to the site and check more of the historical details.

I gave the movie a 4 star rating but it was really a 3 .  I wish the storyline followed the historical records more closely and used real names of the heroes.  It could have been a 5 star movie and the topic deserved it!",1338163200,9,2844,4.453667953667954

4755086,4,B005LAIGNC,"Many have written about the story that needed to be told; my comments will be mostly just about the movie; from one who's loved many war movies (I'm 56 y.o.).

From the first scene, I was loving the realistic CGI (I only wish ""Memphis Bell"" looked anywhere near as good), and hating the way the fighter and bomber pilots spoke. .

The drama dialog was appropriate, and I appreciated the drama scenes in general, but in every battle scene, I felt the dialog was just not right.

Similarly with the music. I'm one (of many I suppose) for whom the music in a war movie drives the pace of the action and the scene cuts. ""Midway"" is a good example; sometimes I'll watch the movie just because I'm so drawn in by the way the music melds with the action. I feel the same about ""In Harms Way""; the music draws you in.

One thing I do really like about the scenes where B17s are under attack;  I liked the bit of extra attention to the trauma and horror being experienced by the guys inside the aircraft as they meet their fate. (I grew up watching the ""12 O'clock High"" series, and also enjoyed ""Memphis Bell"", so I've been through many of these with B17s being shot up and breaking up as they fall out of the sky. )

In general, the Air War over Europe was horrifying, and many men such as our Tuskeegee Airmen as well as the Eigth Air Force had to face up to their possible end on each combat mission. (Attrition rates in the air over Europe were very high.)

This story needs to be told and appreciated, and ""Red Tails"" is another good vehicle.",1338076800,7,1539,4.286206896551724
4755087,3,B005LAIGNC,"I went into this movie hoping that it would live up to the history and honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, but it was just an ok movie. The use of new actors was great in my opinion, and while the acting was brilliant, the script wasn't as fleshed out as it could've been leaving me wanting more. The parts of the bomber crews came off as robotic and predictable and the racism faced by the black crews didn't really feel as challenging as I'm sure the Tuskegee Airmen faced in real life.

Now, I've always been one to read about the air and sea battles of WW2 and this movie didn't disappoint. Everything was in your face and was spectacular from beginning to end. I've heard this movie referred to ""Star Wars with planes"", and it was.

This movie did definitely have it shortcomings, from the script to the editing, but if you just want to get an idea of the heroics of the Airmen, this is the movie to see.",1338076800,5,903,4.2748538011695905

This movie has everything you would expect from a film produced by George Lucas: incredible filmography, fantastic special effects, and a lot of fiction.  It does not have a great script or great acting.

I really feel that Cuba Gooding, Jr. was the most underused actor in the film.  He seemed to be a caricature, more than a character.  He stood around, looking like an African-American MacArthur.  I was surprised that he didn't have the role that Terrence Howard did.  I think it would have worked better that way.

Obviously, artistic license was taken with the film, but I am sorry for those who seem to think that this was a completely faithful retelling of the Tuskegee Airmen.  Not so much.  I'll let you look up those errors for yourself.

4755089,4,B005LAIGNC,"I just watched Red Tails, and I don't know if they originally intended to release it in 3D or not, but it looks fantastic in 3D.

Lucas's stamp is all over this movie, from the dogfights (which he originally modeled the spaceship battles in Star Wars off of, even the airplane sound is reminiscent of Star Wars) to the cast of characters to the emphasis on the ""big picture"" both visually and in the moral and ethical focus of the characters.

I don't have a 3D TV, so I watched it with my TV Eyes 3D glasses. The flight scenes, the vistas of the air bases and the Italian countryside, and some of the closeups really looked good. Someone on the filming crew must have had 3D experience, because it shows through in the movie. (Which is what made me wonder if they'd originally intended a 3D release.)

The plot was a little simplistic, but it wasn't trying to explain the complexities of the whole war and it's effect on the world, simply on this one sector of it. Soldiers, men of courage laying their lives on the line for their country, when that country itself was still rife with bigotry and a blinkered view.

Sometimes it takes something extraordinary to make people look past their assumptions, and sometimes it simply takes people being brave enough to toe the line, to get the job done, to not go for the glory, but simply to get men home alive.

It was, for all its simplicity of focus, a moving movie, I found myself leaking tears and had to take off the glasses to wipe my eyes. The characters are not portrayed in depth, but they are portrayed as very human, so what affected them, affected me.

4755094,1,B005LAIGNC,"I have just rented this movie on cable. Here is the rundown- not a single scene in this ""historically inspired"" movie (other than the racism) is remotely accurate. This is Lucasfilm filming the Rebel Alliance fighting the evil Imperial TIE fighters again. the combat scenes aren't even remotely representative of reality: aircrews did not talk to each other the way they do in this movie (training takes over and pilots know what to do- they don't spend half a minute deciding to make a turn so that the wingman can take out the German because in that half a minute the fight will be over and the pilot who is busy thinking sand discussing tactics will be dead), fighter escorts did not abandon bomber formations until the ""Red Tails"" showed up.  (Until the P-51 Mustangs appeared on the scene, of course, fighters did not have the range to escort bombers all the way to their targets anyway.) German fighters did not attack bomber formations as a tight group of 10-20 fighters (a nice tight bunch to shoot at ensuring that at least some of the German fighters would be downed by bomber gunners on the pass). In the early part of the movie American P-40s down several ME-109s. This would only have happened if the ME-109s were piloted by the worst pilots in the Luftwaffe and the P-40s were flown by the best American pilots: the ME-109s were faster and more agile by far, and had far superior climbing rates (the P-40 was obsolete before the War began). There is a scene where the inchoate Red Tails destroy a Luftwaffe base. The base looked like something out of the 1960s, not like an aerodrome of WWII. Of course the German pilots are wooden, souless killers devoid of emotion. The Red Tails themselves do not act like officers or even enlistedmen- never do we lose the sense that they are actors as they are devoid of all military bearing. Individual B-17s turn out of formation and head for home with battle damage - not a surer way for the pilot of the B-17 to commit suicide or at least guarantee the loss of aircraft ( a lone B-17 would stand no chance as German fighters had cannon that could shoot at the bommbers beyond the range of the machine guns of the bombers- only by staying in formation and covering each other could the bombers hope to survive their missions).

Why couldn't Lucasfilm have taken the truly inspiring story of the Tuskeegee airmen and filmed a movie that reflected the reality of air combat??  This movie makes a mockery of a very important chapter of race relations in America ( the begining of the end of a very sad and disgraceful chpater of American history) I would say it's conection to reality is about the same as Hogan's Heroe  and McHale's Navy- maybe worse because it pretends to be accurate.

2.  But this movie about the Tuskegee Airmen is a half-baked affair.  Unlike a lot of those who liked the CGI, I was kind of put off by it because it appeared so... CGI.  As soon as I saw the initial battle scenes, it was obvious that it was created via CGI;  it reminded me of the history channel Dog Fights.

All of the history is watered down. We get Bryan Cranston as the token racist officer and some acts of racism by the bomber crews but the movie is in a hurry to get it out of the way in order to get to underwhelming CGI airial combat scenes. We never know any of the black pilots real names, where they are from, or even why they have decided to fight for a country that treats them as second class citizens(Terrance Howard's ""God Allmighty"" speech didn't do it for me, sorry). None of the material is treated with any real seriousness and it makes the war almost seem fun,war torn Italy doesnt look war torn. There is no real story, just a a few random events held together with time on the ground that moves at the speed of a glacier.

The antogonist is a German pilot with a fencing scar trying to hard to speak in a menancing manner: ""Die Foolish African!""

One pilot is shot down and sent to a POW camp in Poland, he then makes his way undetected across occupied Europe back to Italy intime for the ending credits!

The fact that there was another movie made about it has nothing to do with what this movie brings to the table.  I had no problems with the acting at all other than Neyo's character and that horrible accent.  Even taking that into account it is not enough to tank the movie for me. My advice to anyone that has not seen the movie would be to go ahead and buy it and view it for yourself. Screw a critic and become your own critic!

4755303,1,B005LAIGNC,"i was VERY excited about this movie till i saw it. To be brief, it LOOKED good, SFX/CGI were top notch. HOWEVER, the acting was terrible, the plot was spoon fed to the viewer, they assume we are no longer capable of inferring things on our own. It was cliche and predictable, and it was technically incorrect!! in one scene (SPOILER STOP NOW!!!!) a character in a P-51 goes nose to nose with a German in an Me-262. he gets shot in the chest a few times and gets a two minute death scene. You don't GET a two minute death scene after you've taken several (let alone ONE) 20mm rounds in the chest. It was insulting. If I was the Tuskagee Airmen i'd be upset.

4755307,2,B005LAIGNC,"And not in a good way.

I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. After all, I'm a pilot; I love good flying movies; and the trailers for this flick looked like it would be right up my alley. Hey, c'mon! P-51s? I'm so there.

But what was really amazing about this movie was that I'd never before in my life watched a movie that was such a complete collection of clich&eacute;s all put together in one place.

Here are the source materials I recognized for this movie, in no particular order:

Hart's War - A Soldier's Story - 12 O'Clock High - Top Gun - Stalag 17 - The Great Escape - Flyboys - The Blue Max - Command Decision - The Bridges at Toko-Ri -  Lucas's own Star Wars series for some of the flying maneuvers and camera angles - and there are probably a couple more that escape me at the moment.

Gotta hand it to Lucas and Company: when they steal, they steal from the best. The problem is, just stringing together a bunch of scenes taken from a bunch of OTHER flicks does not an entertaining movie make.

I will say, the actual flying scenes were pretty interesting. Interesting... not really EXCITING. But I did marvel at the CGI skills on display. As a pilot, it was among the best representations of the flight environment I can recall. That's what earned this the second star, because otherwise it was pretty hopeless. Unengaging, to say the least. Even at that, the flying scenes in Top Gun were better by orders of magnitude.

Don't bother. Really. Unless you're a fan of old movies, and want to see some of their best scenes strung together and played by different actors or something.

Or maybe you can make it a drinking game. ""Name that scene!"" The others who didn't spot it have to down one. Last guy standing's the winner. Something like that.",1337644800,5,1775,4.436923076923077

After watching the supplements, appears to be far more than what met my eyes.

I still have to view the actual film, but having just watched the included, made for this Blu-ray documentary:  ""Double Victory:  The Tuskegee Airmen at War"" the segregation of the times was brought back reflecting on how much has changed through the sacrifices, contributions, and accomplishment of the individuals portrayed in this film.  If the film's story doesn't touch you, this documentary will.

I guess you just can't please some people. I say this because Red Tails has just so much going for it. Based on the famed Tuskegee Airmen, it is an exciting depiction of war in the air, with a great cast, top notch screenplay, and absolutely outstanding computer graphics, courtesy of George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic team, who are simply the best in the business. It all seemed so bloody realistic! As for the cast, well, they were great. Led by Terence Howard & Cuba Gooding Jnr, they faithfully portrayed a group of young negro pilots, sidelined by the US military because of their colour, & the false premise that they lacked the courage & intelligence to fly against the best pilots that Germany could produce. But when they are given the opportunity to act as cover for the long-range bomber groups, they finally get the chance to prove their worth, and they do it in style. The battle scenes are superb & among some of the best computer graphic action you will ever see. I loved Red Tails, & if great war action is your bag, then watch this film; you will not be disappointed.",1336435200,6,1239,4.43859649122807
4755422,1,B005LAIGNC,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.
First, the real Tuskegee Airmen were competent pilots who followed orders. The protagonist is competent, but arrogant. Like Mavrick from Top Gun. I wanted to root for him, but I didn't care for him at all. I ended up caring more for the comic relief character, reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks.
So, right off the bat, the dialogue is bad. Really bad. So bad, that fan movies made by teenagers about Star Wars made in some kid's basement probably had better dialogue than this movie. The dialogue, especially from the ""good"" actors sounds forced and unbelievable. Most lines are useless, simply retelling of what happened, like ""I've been shot!"", just to make sure you're aware of what's happening. Other lines have no real reason for being there, other than to give you a sense of atmosphere.
The acting is simply cringe worthy. I never thought I'd see Cuba Gooding, Jr or Terrance Howard give a poor performance, but they did. Most actors in the movie, most of whom I had never seen before, are extremely void of any depth. The only one who gave a good performance was Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad), even he is wooden and one dimensional. I kept wondering what the point of his character was, other than to reiterate multiple times of what the majority of the Armed Service higher-ups thought of Black pilots.
The CG is beautiful looking, but the movie relies too heavily on it. Most of the scenes that use heavy CG don't do it in an interesting way. Here's a plane. Here's a plane shooting at it. Here's another plane. The explosions are the most exciting thing, since the fire and smoke billow like fluid and it's the greatest thing about this movie. But you realize after seeing it over and over again that it's meant to portray death and you feel a little guilty deriving so much pleasure from it.
Oh, and of course there is a love story shoved in there for good measure. Some might say it's a good way for the audience to identify with the characters, to raise the stakes of their heroic actions. I say rubbish. Love stories are trite and overdone. And it feels doubly so in this movie.
A lot of the scenes are pointless. You get that there is rampant racism and how they are being stabbed in the back by their own Armed Forces. But why must you keep showing it? I get it. Move on. Let me get to know the characters more. Oh, now it's more about the couple in love. Great.
And I almost forgot about ""the bad guy"". The stereotypical antagonist who has no emotional depth, and no real purpose other than to be defeated. He's there. It's disheartening to see that kind of lack of originality in today's movies.
The most annoying thing about this movie? The heroic sounding dialogue. You know, the kind from Brave Heart. It's all over the place. It's in the beginning, in the middle, in the end. When you think you wouldn't hear another line, boom, someone says it randomly. It would be fine at the end of the movie, but not throughout.
Bottom line, this movie is bursting at the seams with stereotypes, lame acting, poor dialogue, pointless plot points, and an ending so contrived, it dawns on you that every movie George Lucas has been involved with in the last 20 years has been an utter disaster.",1336348800,24,3290,4.540404040404041
4755513,3,B005LAIGNC,"I hesitate to write what I really think of this movie as it seems to be so popular, but I do want to give my opinion.

This film starts off unbelievable from the very start.  I was shocked at the horrible dialog of the B-17 crews.  Were they reading it off of cue cards?  No emotion.  No fear.  It's like the makers of this film had never seen ""12 O'Clock High"", ""The War Lover"", ""Battle of Britain"", ""Memphis Belle"" or even the short but emotional fighter scenes from ""Pearl Harbor"".  Did anyone else notice these pilots NEVER used their goggles?  Even the pilot who had fuel pouring into his cockpit didn't use his goggles.  Ridiculous!

Then the CG.  If I'm not mistaken, I think the jeeps in the film were real, and a plane here and there.  The CG was overused and too obvious.

The music score, IMO, was just weird.  I don't think it flowed at all.

The acting was just ok.  There were some good action sequences.  Personally, I think that German pilot did his part better than anyone.

Lastly, I was actually expecting a cameo appearance by Bruce Willis and Steve McQueen.  Could they have come any closer to copying the POW scenes from ""Hart's War"" and ""The Great Escape""?  Can no one in Hollywood have an original thought these days?

Overall, a fair war movie.  Better acting would have made a major improvement.",1336089600,6,1321,4.485232067510548
4755514,3,B005LAIGNC,"This movie documents an important step toward equality in the U.S. military. It is based on the exploits of an Army Air Corps wing staffed by African American men from the Tuskegee training program. We see what a challenge it was for them to find acceptance by fellow military officers, the frustration they encountered because they were issued equipment discarded by other groups and the pride they developed as a much-decorated and highly honored American squadron that contributed to the Allied victory in WWII. I'm happy to see the DVD is available with Amazon.com.

Based on a story by John Ridley (lots of TV) and produced by George Lucas (""Star Wars""), this well-meaning film has plenty of action and humor, but the weak dialogue by Aaron McGruder (""The Boondocks"") left me shaking my head. Anachronisms abounded: ""Man up,"" ""Get your mojo back,"" and ""Stay with me"" (to a wounded airman), sounded more like 2012, not the 1940s.

This cast did a fine job despite the script's many shortcomings:
  * Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") does a quick cameo as a racist officer.
  * Cuba Gooding Jr. (""The Hit List"") smokes a pipe here to give his character gravitas. He is a fair-minded officer who wants his men to succeed and understands the importance of morale.
  * Terrence Howard (""The Brave One"") is the officer who does battle for his men at headquarters. He negotiates for new fighter planes and meaningful assignments.
  * David Oyelowo (""The Help"") brings dash and sex appeal to his character; he's the daredevil who wants to fly that extra sortie and who can spot a beautiful woman from the air. This British-born actor is sensational!
  * Daniela Ruah (""NCIS: Los Angeles"") is the lovely Italian woman our eagle-eyed lover boy spots.

Full disclosure: I'm a former pilot, so I saw illogical scenes that bothered me, but those same scenes might very well be thrilling to a less picky viewer. This is a war movie, so expect male bonding, blood, plenty of dogfights and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff.

Executive producer George Lucas (who personally funded this movie) said in an interview that this project is to celebrate heroes largely forgotten by America, and to offer an opportunity to a galaxy of black actors too often ignored. Kudos!",1335139200,6,2247,4.878947368421053
4755515,5,B005LAIGNC,"I usually do not write reviews, but I must in defense to the other's negative comments. This film is now my favorite movie of all time moving the Star Wars saga/films to second. I have now seen Red Tails ten times in the theater.

Red Tails has exceeded my expectations. From beginning to end I do not want anything changed. The acting was good. The characters such as Lieutenant Ray ""Junior"" Gannon, Lieutenant Joe ""Lightning"" Little, Capitan Marty ""Easy"" Julian, and others captured the heroism and patriotism of the men who fought in the military for the United States of America.

The visuals and action were amazing, especially when it came to the ""dog fights"". Leaving the theater every time gave me the same wow factor and amazing high as the first time I saw this film.

For the people that do not like the film because it was not exactly historically correct should not be any bit surprised. Learn history when you are at school, at the library, from museums, educational channels on television, books, and teach yourself what schools did not teach you. There will not be a movie based on history that will always be correct. You cannot put everything that happened in a two hour and five minute movie. Educate yourself. The theater is not a substitute for education. This movie introduced lost and unknown history to a lot of people. The way Red Tails portrayed the American soldiers was good and correct for people to understand what happened.

This is an emotional film. It shows in small amounts compared to real life the real bigotry that the Americans who happen to be black faced from their fellow citizens. As the film progresses you start to really care and become immersed with the characters and start rooting for them as they beat up on Mr. Hitler. Every time I went to see Red Tails I heard and saw many people crying. Red Tails is the only film that I have every cried. I cried almost every time I saw this film because you become one with the characters and get a very small experience of what soldiers, especially black soldiers experienced.

If  Red Tails doesn't at least get nominated for best picture for  the 2013  Oscars then I call foul and a big shame on the people who vote for the Oscars. I  think Red Tails had groundbreaking special effects  Which I have to hand it to George Lucas and ILM, splendid special effects indeed!  The acting was really superb. If some of the actors in this film are not up for awards for acting at the Oscars then I will say again, I call foul and a big  shame on the people that vote for the Oscars.

4755518,2,B005LAIGNC,"The story of Negro soldiers in the Civil War was ably told in the film ""Glory"".  I was hoping for a movie of that quality about the Tuskegee Airmen, but was disappointed. Lucas ended up making a heroic story a rather ordinary war movie with all of the stock war movie characters:  the rebellious hot-shot who doesn't like to follow orders, the straight-as-an-arrow flight leader dealing with his own inner demons, the baby-faced youngster, and the strummin' jokester, who seemed to me to be a jarring racial stereotype.  There is also the sinister, Darth Vader-like, Nazi pilot and a lame love story.  I don't think Lucas displays an original idea throughout this entire film.  The story of the Tuskegee flyers cries out for a treatment like HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" mini-series.  The CGI, however, is the most amazing I have ever seen.  Perhaps that, for WW2 aviation buffs, makes it worth the price of admission.",1333324800,14,914,4.858064516129033

Since Cuba Gooding Jr. was in BOTH movies I would have thought that at least HE would have mentioned this to someone.

All the actors gave strong performances in forming an entertaining and dramatic portrayal of the Tuskegee Airman.  However, my two favorite character depictions in ""Red Tails"" involved the acting of Terrence Howard as Col. A.J Bullard and Ne-Yo as ""Smoky.""  Terrence Howard cleverly plays a military leader who is tested with making careful decisions under strict circumstances.  Ne-Yo creates a happy persona of someone who cautiously juggles the demands of war with having an optimistic spirit.

4755604,2,B005LAIGNC,"I'm giving one star for good action scenes and another star for some of the history. The Tuskegee Airmen were real, they did serve with distinction, and there was discrimination and segregation.

However, George Lucas unnecessarily dumbed down the story - ostensibly for dramatic effect? - to a degree that I found extremely annoying. I might have forgiven the clich&eacute;d and one-dimensional depiction of the German fighters as not merely racist but also evil. The Americans may have been racist, but they were not evil. :-) But I can't forgive the depiction of the white American fighters as unrepentant glory seekers who abandon their bomber squadrons - time and time again - in order to pursue a few decoy German fighters. This film implies that the only reason the all-black 332nd Fighter Group was given the opportunity to escort a bomber squadron was because white escorts were not reliable. The film also implies that when bomber squadrons had white escorts there were far more casualties, but with the 332nd there were very few or none. Indeed, there was one scene showing how surprised the bomber pilots were that the black fighters were not going to abandon them as the white fighters would.

Now, if there is ANY truth to this, that white fighters were not reliable and often abandoned the bomber squadrons they were supposed to protect, then I will apologize and revise my review. But I see this as a huge red flag that history is not just being dramatized, or revised, but mangled. By stooping so low, Lucas isn't honoring the distinguished Tuskegee Airmen.

P.S. I wonder if the folks who are giving me negative votes could tell me why in the comments section? I'm curious. Do you disagree with the substance of my criticism, that this movie inaccurately portrays white fighter pilots as unreliable?",1329264000,38,1817,4.912052117263844
4755605,3,B005LAIGNC,"Red Tails is a captivating film that delves into the issue of racial inequality and segregation in the military during World War II. This movie is based on true events that transpired during the height of the Jim Crow era, and it is a story that George Lucas (creator of Star Wars) felt needed to be shared in full cinematic capacity. The story revolves around the 332nd Tuskegee Fighter Group, which was comprised of elite African American pilots. The main theme of this film is based on the fact that the United States government did not have faith in African American pilots and concluded that they were mentally and genetically inferior to whites because of biased case studies that took place in 1925. Therefore, they deduced that the Airmen could not complete combat missions, but when the U.S. and European powers had their backs against the wall because the Nazi's were gaining the upper hand, it was up to the Tuskegee Fighter Group to help win the war against tyranny.

Red Tails had great subplots, which will keep you engaged throughout the film, plus the characters are well developed and emotional. You will get a sense of being right in the middle of the action because the CGI used was impeccable. Overall, this was a historically entertaining piece of cinematography that any fan of these types of movies will enjoy. This is a must watch film because of its historical value, plus the fact that Terrance Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. star in the film is a plus since they always give outstanding performances.

Red Tails receives Three STARS!!!!!",1329177600,4,1561,4.799256505576208
4755606,3,B005LAIGNC,"George Lucas has overseen the creation and American phenomenon's of six ""Star Wars"" movies and four ""Indiana Jones"" movies, including producing many other smash hit movies, and with his latest Lucas studios release, he says that he's done everything he ever dreamed of doing. That latest release is a biopic about a crew of Negro pilots in the Tuskegee training program, otherwise known as the Red Tails. Not unlike the things that the Tuskegee airmen had to face, on top of facing Nazi's during World War 2, George Lucas faced much alienation with this project from studio executives across Hollywood. Despite his credentials and his long time devotion to the project, Lucas couldn't get a `yes' from a single one of them.

Well, ""Red Tails"" may just be one of Lucas' best movies in years, although that isn't saying much. The Tuskegee airmen were delegated to, as one airmen stated in the film, ""shooting traffic""; trains and trucks. Not only were they wrongfully characterized as unintelligent and not brave enough, but they also were facing a public relations machine in a military that didn't want negro airmen getting credit for battles in the newspapers. Thus, they were given unimportant missions.

""Red Tails"" is a good return for George Lucas, but also for Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire"" and then went into B-movie oblivion. Terrence Howard has been on a similar road since ""Ray"" and ""Hustle and Flow"", although he's bounced back and forth with an occasional hit.  The real stars of the movie are Nate Parker, who plays Captain Marty ""Easy"" Julian and David Oyelowo who plays Joe ""Lightning"" Little. The two of them are best friends and give character and soul to a film and a story that needed a face.

George Lucas is no stranger to filming and creating aerial battles. We've seen them dozens of times in his Star Wars movies and his expertise shows in this movie, they are just a little closer to earth. The battle scenes in ""Red Tails"" are real and engaging. Although some of the dialogue is really stiff and was a direct contrast to the realism of the battle scenes.
The biggest problem with ""Red Tails"" has nothing to do with the characters, the story that needs to be told and the battles that were fought and ignored, but the fact that the movie could have told so much more of a story and didn't. Truth be told, the story of the Tuskegee airmen is history that we didn't learn. It is a story that needs to be seen and heard by everyone, but the movie doesn't give it justice. The movie plays like a footnote only to inform us of their existence, but never gets beyond the surface to inform us of anything more.

""Red Tails"" could have been so much more, but I still recommend the film, just for the sheer sake that this is a story that isn't taught in our schools and should be.",1329177600,13,2821,4.611553784860558
4755607,2,B005LAIGNC,"Could you love a country that abused and mistreated you? Could you fight, kill, or die for it? That question is answered with a resounding ""yes"" by the characters portrayed in this most recent film about the first all African-American unit of fighter pilots in World War II.

  The film opens with three pilots encountering a suspicious train which they believed to be carrying armaments to the Axis forces. The more reckless among them, Joe ""Lightning"" Little (played by David Oyelowo) disobeys orders and attacks from the front destroying the engine and the train itself while causing not-insignificant damage to his plane. This caused great distress to the mechanic charged with repairing ""Lightning's"" plane while his disregard for the chain of command is the primary complaint of his group leader, Martin ""Easy"" Julian (played by Nate Parker). And in the background there is constant politicking from those who believe the group is a failure and a waste of resources while others like Colonel A.J. Bullard (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) are making efforts to secure more important assignments and the superior aircraft they would need to complete them.

  The story of The 332nd Fighter Group is an inspiring chapter in American military history. So inspiring, in fact, that it's already been told once before in the 1995 HBO film The Tuskegee Airmen. While the HBO effort was not without its problems, overall it is a superior film. True, the dog fighting scenes in Red Tails are very well-done and highly entertaining but at the time HBO was not the powerhouse it is today and if there is one thing George Lucas knows, it's aerial battles. And I was happy to see him produce something that wasn't designed to capitalize on already successful and creatively exhausted franchises. Still, this is the lesser of two films on an important subject. As the 1995 film is available to rent on Netflix and available for purchase at prices cheaper than that of a movie ticket, see The Tuskegee Airmen instead.",1328745600,2,2003,4.946428571428571
4755608,2,B005LAIGNC,"Combining the themes of ""Glory"" with ""Memphis Belle"", this film tells, what is now, the well-known and still inspiring story of the 332nd Fighter Group, the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Although fighting in a segregated armed forces and judged inferior by the racism of the era, the Airmen compiled one of the more enviable fighting records of the USAAF. Although most of their missions involved the un-sexy work of providing cover for heavy bomber raids, only 25 bombers were lost during the hundreds of missions during which they were stewarded by the 332nd.

The film itself must be judged in two categories, the acting and the action scenes. The latter win out as the aerial battle scenes at times take your breath away and look realistic enough to make you feel like a wingman. Anyone who loves WWII aircraft will thrill to see the Me-262, the first operational jet fighter, mixing it up with the P-51's of the Red Tails. And, as a point of interest, the Red Tails DID destroy a German warship as depicted in the film.

Unfortunately, the movie deserves the blasting it has gotten over the wooden acting and rote screenplay. Everyone is a tad too heroic (Cuba Gooding Jr. looks ready to break his teeth by the way he clamps his pipe) and the white airmen are a bit too solicitous for the realities of the 1940's. Despite his billing, Bryan Cranston is virtually non-existent, although David Oyelowo projects some fine stage presence. There are enough cast members present from ""The Wire"" (Andre Royo, Tristan Wilds) to make you wish that Omar Little would appear, in his own plane (with its own markings) and possibly shooting both Americans and Germans out of the sky in his unique anarchic way.

Speaking of Germans, the Messerschmitts are led by a stereotypically evil Nazi who just before his demise, utters (so help me, god) ""DIE, YOU FOOLISH AFRICAN!"" one of the strangest lines ever put to celluloid. Go see ""Red Tails"" with profoundly low expectations and you won't be disappointed. At least, you'll see some cool flying scenes.",1327708800,7,2035,4.825214899713467
4755609,4,B005LAIGNC,"I've long thought that that an updated telling of the Red Tails needed to be told, and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for months...tonight I finally had the chance.

Perhaps I may have built up my expectations too much with the trailers, personal expectations, etc., but all in all the best I can say is that I liked, not loved it.

Some of my favorite movies are war movies, e.g., Battle of Britain, Fly Boys, Battle of the Bulge, Twelve O-Clock High, The Longest Day, etc., so I'm always on the lookout for a new good war movie that's based on a great true story.

""Red Tails"" had the potential to zoom into the best war movies ever made, but somehow the buttons that I thought would and needed to be pushed were pushed only lightly and infrequently.  There was not enough background of the challenges faced by African American fliers in the military in the 1940s, there was not enough of the drudgery of the non-essential(?) missions they flew after they arrived in Italy, not enough of the struggles they had to go through to fly combat missions, and, frankly, there were not enough sequences of aerial combat - the real Red Tails flew a TON of missions.  I thought that the side stories, for example of the off-base personal lives of some of the fliers was in a way distracting from the main story (a la Ben Affleck's romance in ""Pearl Harbor"").  It did provide an interesting glimpse into the different way that Italians and Americans viewed African-Americans in those days, and while that was interesting, it was not central enough in my opinion to devote so much of the movie to it.

I guess the reason that the overall experience seemed a bit, um, lacking to me is that I constantly felt like I was joining a conversation already in progress or an event already in progress, and that I was not presented the whole story.  Fortunately I already knew something about the Red Tails, so I was able to catch up and make sense of everything, but if someone was just strolling into a theater to watch the movie, they could have been lost in terms of the big picture.

All in all I'd have to say that I'd give the movie ""Red Tails"" somewhere between a 6 and an 8 out of 10.  I even debated with myself over whether I thought it was ""OK"" or ""I liked it.""  ""I loved it"" was not one of the options I was considering.

I salute the original Red Tails for their service and sacrifice, and George Lucas for producing this story that needed to be told.  I just wish that the film had more umph in the telling.

I debated between 3 and 4 stars, but opted for 4 because the story is worthy.",1327449600,14,2599,4.376299376299376
4755610,2,B005LAIGNC,"Without being too wordy and too boring, ""Red Tails"" had the potential of being a very good movie. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" was much better. It tells the story without all the really dull moments and really boring dialog.",1327449600,5,256,4.976744186046512
4755611,4,B005LAIGNC,"It may seem a little strange for George Lucas to self-finance an action movie about the Tuskegee Airmen. But it's a true story with all the hallmarks of an epic tale: downtrodden heroes, lots of adversity, an enemy we love to hate. Red Tails makes for compelling film material.

For an epic tale, Red Tails is in many ways narrow in scope. There is little backstory. We begin in Italy, where black airmen are already flying missions. There is little to no information about their backgrounds and training, though it is obvious they are well-educated. There is some story on the ground, enough to keep the film moving and interesting. But it's also cliched and a little cheesy in moments, in the ways you'd probably expect. And that's okay.

Take one part Star Wars and one part Top Gun and you've got the feel for the battles in-flight. I am not a big action fan, but I enjoyed them.

Red Tails is not going to win many awards. But it's the kind of movie that needs to keep being made. In a nation full of reality television vapidity, Red Tails is a movie that exposes people to true American heroes who embodied excellence and were willing to sacrifice everything for a country all too ready to count them out. The Tuskegee Airmen were men of courage and of faith. This film honors their memory and is the sort of story that inspires and will continue to do so for many years as children watch it for the first time and are inspired to learn more about their history.

Lucas has mentioned that as he contemplated the project for over two decades, he eventually envisioned the story as a trilogy (surprise, surprise!) However strange it sounds, I would love to see a prequel made that explains the background and training of the men before they reach Europe. A sequel that shows what happens when they return home would also make a worthwhile film. Though Red Tails does stand alone, it feels incomplete, there is just so much story left to be told.

I'd commend Red Tails to you and I think it is more family friendly than the rating (PG-13) implies. The language is pretty clean and the romance is not nearly as racy as 90% of PG-13 movies. The rating is for the violence of war, which is less gruesome in the air than other combat movies.",1327363200,12,2241,4.496314496314496
