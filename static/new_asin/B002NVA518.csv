8375465,1,B002NVA518,"Although I looked forward to what seemed like an extraordinary collection of several of Beethoven's string quartets, the DVD would not play because it was not designed to be played in the U.S.  Looking back at the website, I saw nothing that would indicate it was unsuitable for the U.S.
I also noticed that a previous reviewer had made a similar comment but unfortunately I had already ordered it.",1451174400,,398,4.768115942028985
8375466,4,B002NVA518,"Occasionally there are a few intonation problems, but this is more than made up for by the passion and drama of these live performances. The short documentary extra is quite entertaining, interesting, funny and delightfully free from professional, big label slickness.
You also get a very generous walloping of Beethoven Quartets brilliance from all phases of his miraculous career. Recommended.",1407369600,,395,5.6
8375467,3,B002NVA518,The 2nd disc would not play on my recent SONY player or the Phillips.  Performances semed okay. Maybe this copy is a fluke,1358985600,,122,4.304347826086956
8375468,1,B002NVA518,Ordered this disk twice and both times the disks would not play.  Disks appear to be from a different region code.,1292284800,,114,4.428571428571429
