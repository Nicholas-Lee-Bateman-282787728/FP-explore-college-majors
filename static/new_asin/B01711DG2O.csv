7486134,5,B01711DG2O,Amazing! This is by far the best season of black butler out of the three!! I pre ordered so i got it the day it came out. Got it brand new not damaged. If u love ciel and Sebastian this is a perfect season for you!,1461283200,,214,3.6739130434782608
7486135,5,B01711DG2O,"If you are a fan of the manga then you will most likely enjoy this season. For those who are familiar with the manga series Black Butler Book of Circus is the fourth arc of the manga storyline. This storyline is a continuation of the first season (up to the Indian Butler arc around episode 15 in the anime) and remains true to the dark and graphic(at times) nature of the series. For those who were disappointed with Black Butler II (the second season that was not related to the manga, but it's own season) than this will definitely be something different hopefully worthwhile. The soundtrack of the series is not bad and there are some comedic aspects within the series to help break up the gloom and doom feel. Because there are only 10 episodes it is a fast series (though still longer than the Book of Murder which was broken down into two movies in Japan). It would have been nice if they had included book of murder to this as well since that series was short but I'm just excited that they actually dubbed and released both of these seasons in the U.S. given the length of time between each of the seasons.",1461196800,6,1115,4.41747572815534
7486136,5,B01711DG2O,This is one of my favorite animes l'm  very happy Black Butler is back.,1461110400,,71,4.071428571428571
7486137,5,B01711DG2O,More fantastic adventures told closer to how the manga read. We've enjoyed watching and can't wait for the next set to be released!,1461110400,,131,4.739130434782608
7486138,3,B01711DG2O,I thought this was the worst of the three seasons and it's incredibly overpriced for only 10 episodes. They really should have a packaged this with the  Book of murder. It's an obvious price grab from Funimation to split the series up and then charge so much for both of them.,1461110400,7,276,4.411764705882353
7486139,4,B01711DG2O,Someone correct me if I am wrong. But I think this is part of OVA or is it maga? But this is not the third season to the black butler streaming on Netfix. I saw it and bought it out of impulse instead of reading. However this is still really good in itself! Like a little side story. Its still a masterpiece with ups and downs keeping everyone entertained. A lovely addition to the collection.,1461110400,2,393,4.253333333333333

7486141,5,B01711DG2O,"This series is wonderful! It stayed true to the manga which I really enjoyed. We laughed, we gasped and even had one son leave the room because he couldn't handle the suspense of some parts. We throughly enjoyed it and have already preordered the next series..Book of Murder.",1461024000,10,275,4.75

7486144,5,B01711DG2O,"This was one of my favorite story arcs in the manga and I must admit I was a bit nervous at how this would turn out. I loved the first half of season 1 when they were still following the manga, but was a little so-so about what they did with the second half and season 2. All my worries dissipated as I watched the sub version of Book of Circus. It was amazing, and honestly I think even better than the first half of season 1. True to the manga, the designs and colors were incredible, and the characters were beyond my expectations. That ending made me want more!!",1497225600,,566,4.154545454545454

7486158,5,B01711DG2O,"what's not to love, an alternate season of Black Butler based on the manga series after season 2 left us all so bitter- and happy ahaha. Book of Circus is just what fans need to just enjoy another round of the Earl and his demon butler, it's fun, it's strange, this has everything.",1480809600,,281,4.320754716981132

7486165,5,B01711DG2O,My daughter is a big Black Butler fan.  She loved this.  I got the entire set for her birthday.  These are very good quality movies.

7486168,5,B01711DG2O,I have always been a fan of this anime and it keeps getting better and better. This season really outdid the last one when it came to plot development. I didn't know exactly how being in a circus would work for these two but each episode left me wanting to continue from one episode to the next in order to find out what exactly were happening to those missing children.  The last few episodes threw me for a loop when an interesting secret is revealed and Ceil is left with a decision that only the Queen's guard dog could justify with.,1468454400,,537,4.316831683168317
7486169,5,B01711DG2O,I was so excited to get this!!! This season is awesome. If you love the manga then you will love Book of Circus!,1467417600,,112,3.9130434782608696
7486170,5,B01711DG2O,"It had me hooked by the first episode, and I found myself re-watching the season right after I had finished it. The animation is better than season 1 and 2, it's more fluid and natural in the movements of the characters. The story line is more gripping, and the humour and dialogue is on point. The music fits it perfectly.

This is the season I suggest watching first because it is superior, in my opinion, to it's predecessors. The first season I would only suggest watching as it has more details about certain events that are briefly mentioned in this season. The second season *spoiler alert kind of?* doesn't follow the manga at all, but is rather, for lack of better wording, fanfiction-esque (an alternate universe version at that--meaning the writers apparently weren't happy with how the story went in the manga and decided to write an alternate ending). This season  follows the manga beautifully and I was so captivated by the animation and the bright colours. It left me with an ache in my heart, as well.

This is, by far, the best of Black Butler I've seen (I've not seen Black Butler: Book of Murder).

It's definitely worth the money and time (especially if you're a fan of the first season)!",1467244800,7,1209,4.661971830985915

7486173,5,B01711DG2O,I was wondering how they did season 3 based off of how season 2 ended.  This is a continuation of stories that happened before season 2.  It was still great.,1466899200,,157,4.2

If you're a BB fan then you have to see this season.",1464566400,,338,3.842857142857143

7486182,4,B01711DG2O,"Rather than discuss the show, I want to discuss the physical product. Naturally I think the show is wonderful or else I wouldn't have paid almost $50 for it. This is the blu-ray/DVD combo pack of Black Butler: Book of Circus. It comes with a total of four disks, two DVDs and two blu-ray. The actual casing isn't anything special, but it does look nice. Unfortunately, there are not a ton of extras included with this season. There are a couple of episode commentaries and some trailers, but nothing else. The price is a expensive for such a short season, but it is typical for anime. Overall, I'd say it's worth it to buy the season if you're a Black Butler fan. You won't get a plethora of extras, but the dub is well done and it makes a nice addition to any anime collection.",1463961600,17,778,4.372413793103449

7486186,5,B01711DG2O,"Best Kuroshitsuji anime I`ve seen, the manga brought to life vividly like  Hellsing Ultimate with its OVA series. Great voice acting, great story, great OST, a MUST for anyone who loves this series.",1463443200,,198,5.0
7486187,5,B01711DG2O,"This looks amazing on blu ray. The packaging was not dented and it came in very good condition. The shipping was so fast I didn't expect to be watching it only a few days after I ordered. The episodes are so entertaining it was beyond worth it for the price. There are not very many episodes though so it goes by very fast unfortunately, but each episode is exciting and leaves you wanting more. I recommend watching season one episodes 1-15 and then skipping right to this. It just makes so much more sense this way. This is most seriously the best season of Kuroshitsuji I have ever seen. I can watch this over and over.",1463443200,4,622,4.370689655172414
7486188,2,B01711DG2O,"First off, let me state that I LOVE Kuroshitsuji. Absolutely adored the first two seasons, and I am a HUGE fan! But this....eh. Not so great. Not only is it over priced for so few episodes, but there also isn't much for bonus content. There was extremely weak character development for this season, which is abnormal for Black Butler. I honestly didn't give a crap about anyone outside of the main characters, whom we barely saw (other than Ciel and Sebastian, of course).

In the previous seasons, the 'adventures' they faced would only last one or two episodes, which would lead up to something bigger. It kept things fresh and interesting. Not the case here. It's one, long, dragged out episode...and quite drab, if you ask me.

As for the physical aspects of this box, I anticipated it would be like the previous one, where there was a slot left open for Book of Murder to slide in. Not so, and instead includes one of those weak, paper-like (very thin cardboard) cases that unfolds. Not a fan of anything about this set, honestly.",1462060800,,1035,4.6502732240437155
7486189,5,B01711DG2O,"Excellent adaptation of the manga - this season seems to follow the books a little more closely than Season 2. Voice acting in the English translation is excellent - it's hard to believe the actors are all American.

If your kids are watching this, you may want to skip the extras. The two main actors appear in the commentary, and they look nothing like their cartoon characters. You may have some very disappointed preteen girls when they find out that Ciel is actually played by a voluptuous young actress, and not a cute 13-year-old boy.

Story gets very dark this season...recommend for ages 12 and up",1461801600,7,606,4.7075471698113205
7486190,5,B01711DG2O,I love Black Butler.  season 3 is just amazing.  i love the story and the characters.  this is must see for any Black Butler fan.  I do recommend this series for anyone who wants a good victorian era supernatural comedy/drama.,1461801600,2,226,4.575
7486191,5,B01711DG2O,"Probably stands as the best season out of them all, in my opinion and a great set up for the two part OVA coming up (I'm referring to Book of Murder). The season is of course based on the famous story arc in the manga series. Children disappearing all over London, and coincide with a traveling Circus troupe. It troubles Her Majesty, and calls upon Ciel and Sebastian to safely return them home. Now for an English dub, they of course recruit the same voice actors for the regular characters you fell in love with from the previous two seasons. And the voices they found for the new characters are quite well done. Perhaps my favorite was who they recruited to play Doll. However, my least favorite was Daggers voice. It was a bit too high pitched, but still made Dagger believable (To me, at least). Not many goodies are offered in this dvd package though. (I personally would Have settled for outtakes and such) And there are only two commentaries, but overall... That doesn't stop me from giving credit where it's due. 5 out of 5 from me. It's worth the money, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Trust me.",1461628800,2,1118,4.458536585365854

Although if there are people searching the comments to find out about the type of show this is - I think most would agree that it's definitely not for kids (using your own discretion to make the age determination, of course). It's very dark and is full of mature themes, and I think most would not want their young kids watching this.",1517011200,,547,4.310679611650485

8737825,5,B01711DG2O,The black butler series is one of those that is a rare instance of great writing. Able to move your very heart with its melancholic emotional writing and resonating with the darkness inside all of us. Black butler in any season but especially this one is a story that is truly wonderful. This season fills you with a melancholy that lasts for days and shows off the dark side humans have towards even each other. While this is a work of fiction the cruelty it highlights is not far off from real human actions (if you ignore the supernatural). A startling reminder in our hearts of what we truly can be to each other it is simply wonderful. I would recommend it as a beautiful yet sad piece of art to anyone.,1498780800,,708,4.371212121212121
