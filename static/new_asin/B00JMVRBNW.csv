8652514,3,B00JMVRBNW,The People's Front of Judea give this movie two thumbs up. The Judean People's Front are less enthused.,1521331200,,103,4.777777777777778
8652515,3,B00JMVRBNW,"I got excited at the beginning of the movie: great production, music...it looked like it was going to be a winner.  But the movie had maybe a half dozen knee-slappers; the rest was just not very good.  It was like watching the ""Deja Vu"" skit over and over.",1515196800,,256,4.3125
8652516,5,B00JMVRBNW,"There are certain movies that stand out on the holidays.  This is not one of them.  It probably should be.  You will find that many of the Python crew plays many different characters in the movie.

Now the truth can be told.  It all starts with three wise men delivering gifts to young Brian.  Oops they correct their mistake.  Later, Judea, 33 A.D., on a Saturday afternoon, once again Brian (Graham Chapman) is a tad far down the mount when they hear what sounds as ""blessed are the cheese makers"" (it's not meant to be taken literally that could mean any manufacturer).  That is where Brian first sees Judith (Sue Jones.)  Later he shall be involved in the People's Front of Judea.  Later still he will be mistaken for the messiah (it is a logical mistake).  Two factions fight over who owns the messiah (the Shoe Followers and Gourd Followers.)

You will recognize many of your favorite vices and verses.  One of the highlights of the story is the speech given by Pilate and Biggus Dickus.
As with most complex movies you will find the one you are looking for Python comedy, fanatic parody, or if you wish a deeper meaning.

If you enjoyed this movie the next on your list should be ""Wholly Moses"" (1983) with Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman.",1496707200,,1246,4.554054054054054

8652519,5,B00JMVRBNW,"The Best of the Monty Python Movies.  There was a lot of controversy when they made this movie,  but it does not mock religion but is a satire of people at the time of Christ.  Very funny,  watch the deleted scenes too.",1469664000,,219,4.142857142857143

8652521,5,B00JMVRBNW,"This is a funny movie! This is a great addition to the Monty Python film series. It's very entertaining. It might not be for everyone. It's pretty risqu and it caused controversy among religious people when it was first released. But, if you like Monty Python and their sense of humor, or even if you just like comedy, you might enjoy this. It's got some cool special features on it too. The special features are in line with the Pythons' sense of humor. I got this Bluray shortly after Christmas of 2015 and I watched it and I thought it was a great movie and I was glad to have it as part of my Python film collection. I think it's definitely worth a look, so I recommend it.",1462838400,,677,4.255813953488372
