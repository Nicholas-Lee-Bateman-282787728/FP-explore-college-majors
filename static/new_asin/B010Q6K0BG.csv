7315679,5,B010Q6K0BG,"I agree with my fellow reviewer. I really loved the later part of season R and I'm so glad it's coming out. I've loved all of the new dub sets I've gotten so far (I have all of them so far) but I must admit, I wish they had some sort of box set that had this new English dub with the old English dub. I think both are great in their own ways but their are things about the first dub I really miss, like the songs for one. I love the songs, one of my favs being ""She's got the power"" that plays during one of the Rubis fight. Plus the voice actor for Prince Diamond in the first dub, oh he was so HOT!! First time I had a crush on a voice. But I'm happy to have a least one version on DVD and hopefully the new voice actor for his character will do just as good job. Hulu, Netflix and things are great but I still like having the DVD's. That way I'm not out of luck if my internet goes down or my computer breaks..",1437955200,7,913,3.7853403141361257

Right now I am watching these episodes, because they're on Hulu for free currently!

7315681,4,B010Q6K0BG,"I love this season!  It's the finale to my favorite season (besides SailorStars, which hasn't been released on BluRay yet).

However, like with all the other releases prior to it, I have an issue with the compression that they use.  It introduces a lot of noise that I think wouldn't be there if they had used a different compression method.

How do I know it's compression and not just noise from 25+ year old footage?  Check out my screnshot.  You'll notice that Ami's mouth is in two different positions but the noise on the bow and collar stay exactly the same.  If it had been standard old-footage noise, the noise would also be in two different places.  This is a compression type that, essentially, decides that if the footage doesn't move, then it shouldn't waste precious data on creating entirely new frames and only updates what has changed.  This results in drastically improved file size--but as you can see, at the cost of noise.  (These screenshots, even though they show a scene from the first season, came from the last episode in this BluRay.)

I have a feeling that if they had used a lossless compression method that the footage would look much cleaner.",1515283200,2,1173,4.700980392156863

Received my order today.  I was disappointed to find that the slip cover is missing.  It sad that the quality control isn't as watchful as it could be and should be.

I've been a huge fan of Sailor Moon ever since I was a little girl and I even grew up liking the sub-par dubbing that DIC did back in the 90's.

7315721,5,B010Q6K0BG,"so like all the others out there, the was an issue with the 2nd disc, mainly episode 80 where the video craps out, well fear not as they have since fixed that issue in this box set and if you buy the December release of this item you will get the corrected box set, just watched the episode on both dvd and blu ray sub and dubbed and nothing is wrong with it, now for the series in itself this is sailor moon R part 2 of season 2, or as some would say the dark moon ark, this is NOT THE DIC DUB so serena is not her name it is her real name of usagi, its wonderful that vis media has obtained the rights to all 200 episodes and from what I hear the 3 movies and a few sub plot episodes as well, the season is much more accurately dubbed in English and the Japanese subs are much more accurate to what is actually being said, if your a fan of sailor moon or grew up with the really bad DIC dubs I highly recommend getting this as this is an awesome bluray set and a wonderful treat for fans young and old, cant wait for the season 3 arc where we get the fan favorite outer senshi, and the infinity arc from the manga, anyone would be a fool to not add this plus the last 3 sets to there collection, the DIC dubs have there charm but this redub is so much better as the plot is much more closer to the series as a whole and fits better with the last 3 seasons.",1453420800,15,1358,3.870967741935484

7315728,5,B010Q6K0BG,"This is another great release from ViZ. Don't you listen to that disgusting, ugly worded review by Always Samsung on here. They obviously don't know the difference between zero talent and great voice actors like Stephanie Sheh, Johnny Bosch, Michelle Ruff, Veronica Taylor, Steve Cannon and all the other veteran voice actors lending their voices to this great series which is a shame because they're obviously just blinded by their nostalgia of the old DiC dub.

I guess you all know that there was one complaint about this set, that the voices are off synch at some point in Episode 80 ""A terrifying illusion! Ami all alone."" Other than that this release is as good as all the other sets ViZ has released so far. I cannot wait to see what they do with the S series, the movies and their release of Crystal. Hopefully the cover art will have more variety instead of just seeing Sailor Moon on the covers of the Part 1 sets...and I'd like to see some blue color too.

Anyways I haven't had a chance to look at the bluray discs of this set but I'm watching the DVD's on a Sylvania mini DVD player while I'm deployed out here and the picture is clear and crisp! Its way better than the set ADV films released a decade ago. If you've been collecting the sets so far don't miss out on this one.

7315738,1,B010Q6K0BG,"I'm a Sailor Moon fan for life and I know the original DiC dub in the 1990's wasn't the best and on many occassions, the plot line steered in a different direction than the original. However, that version had a lot of personality, comedy, and heart. Plus, it had a great soundtrack. There are songs from the DIC dubb that I'll always remember. Songs that will always bring me back to a certain place and time long gone.

With that being said, the new dubbed version doesn't have any personality, heart, or comedy. Everyone sounds the same and the lead for Sailor Moon has no comedic timing in her voice whatsoever. I understand the reason for being faithful to the original source and the English actors are literally reading each line word for word. That doesn't always work and it doesn't always translate well from one culture to another. The bun head thing is ridiculous. Nobody in America really says ""bun"" or even uses that word. Meatball head was funny. Sometimes it's good to Americanize a show to cater to a new audience in a different country. There's nothing wrong with that. Clearly, Viz media doesn't know anything about that. The voice actors are so poorly cast and the outdated Japanese music just doesn't work. It's funny how Viz Media can make Ranma funny, but they couldn't do that with this show.

I got the combo set despite the fact that it's so difficult to get through one single episode. But I'm Sailor Moon fan for life and got it to show my devotion. I would have paid anything to have the original voice actors reunite for this rerelease.",1446076800,8,1565,4.60573476702509

It is then revealed that Chibiusa is actually the future daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, much to their surprise!  While in the future, Chibiusa goes missing and Sailor Moon gets kidnapped by Black Moon Clan member Prince Dimande, who wants her all to himself. While Sailor Moon is able to escape the clutches of Prince Dimande, Chibiusa is not so lucky. She is brainwashed by Wiseman into believing everyone hates her and that, in turn, transforms her into Black Lady. The season concludes with the Sailor Guardians defeating the Black Moon Clan and restoring Chibiusa to her adorable and innocent self. Oh and I can't forget about the introduction of yet another Sailor Guardian: Sailor Pluto, the Guard to the Space-Time Door. Overall, Sailor Moon R is a great season and filled with plenty of action and adventure to keep the viewer guessing and on the edge of their seat.
