7984146,4,B00008H2I0,"Pedro and Damian are soldiers of fortunes, mercenaries, returning home after some Mexican war or other.  Along the way they met and are joined by the Casilda, a beautiful young woman whose presence causes deep and dangerous changes in the lives of the two men.

  According to a bit of text in the on-disk biography, EL TRES DE COPAS (1986) is an example of Mexican New Wave cinema.  It took me a while to warm up to this movie.  Pedro and Damian spend an awful lot of time sitting in bars, staring off camera into space.  With their handsome square jaws and chic glistening beard stubble they look like they're auditioning for a Calvin Klein ad.  They don't say or, worse of all, do all that much sometimes, but they always seem to be brooding over something.

 But the story took hold of me somewhere along the line and I began to enjoy it.  The photography is beautiful, and the story of a beautiful woman coming between two good friends who were raised as brothers has great potential, much of which is exploited masterfully by director Felipe Cazals.  Best of all, after I got hooked I wasn't able to predict where the movie was going.  Different and entertaining, and worth a watch if you're a fan of westerns",1126310400,4,1215,4.518348623853211
