8575029,5,B00BXGUD34,"Perhaps this is from a nearby alternate universe where the copyright holders/owners/etc actually release products to customers rather than storing it in ""the vault""?  Possibly it's from the future?  The series never said the Phoenix Gate was actually destroyed, so one never knows.  :)

Business Model A: Release Product, customers purchase said product, copyright holder now has extra cash on hand along with a happier customer base.  Business Model B: Release Nothing, no added income stream.  Stockholders shake their heads.

So far as THIS reality goes, they finally released Season 2 Vol 2, so perhaps Season 3 is just another decade away.",1471996800,3,644,5.254901960784314

8575034,1,B00BXGUD34,"So everyone knows it, this does not exist. Disney has never released season 3 of the series in any format and only this year released Season 2 Vol. 2(after waiting several years since Season 2 Vol. 1 came out.) Which needless to say means they have never released the complete series either, hence only one person, selling one copy of this.

To be crystal clear this item is almost assuredly someones bootleg of the series, regardless how much effort they put into the packaging they quality of the actual video files will likely reflect that it is from a low quality source(9 discs make up the proper DVD release of the first two seasons, where as this set is 5 discs for 3 seasons of content.) This is all before getting into the problem with the asking price, do not encourage this sort of thing.",1386201600,158,799,4.510344827586207
