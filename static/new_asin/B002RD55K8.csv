8378639,5,B002RD55K8,I loved this movie.  It's in French with English subtitles (very helpful) and lots of funny moments.  All the actors were terrific in it and the singing was a bonus.  I highly recommend this to all who love old movies.,1388620800,,218,4.4
8378640,5,B002RD55K8,"I loved this movie because it was very entertaining and funny. ""Sticky Fingers"" as it is called in English was enjoyable. Of course I enjoy Roy Dupuis in most everything that he does because he is such a great actor and they are hard to find in my opinion. They all had to change their lives. They all had o become better people. Mr Dupuis had a really hard time coming around at first, but it worked out in the end. Just watch it, you will like the movie!",1354492800,2,456,4.134831460674158
