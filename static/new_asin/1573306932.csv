191489,4,1573306932,"Message to love - The Isle of Wight festival 1970. Organised in the wake of the iconic Woodstock festival of 1969, half a million flower children descended on an island in southern England, in search of peace, love and understanding. 2 hours of footage highlights legendary performances by The Who, Joan Baez, Miles Davis, an interrupted performance by Joni Mitchell, Free, The Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Ten Years After, and the last stage performances of Jim Morrison with the Doors, and Jimi Hendrix,18 days before his death. The controversial fence that divided ticket holders from the freeloading gatecrashers. The backstage backstabbing that almost wrecked the festival for the performers and people alike. Captured on film is what many have called the last great Rock Festival or Britain's Woodstock, where many of those hippie ideals were lost. The music stands the test of time!",1418688000,,886,5.2027972027972025

191491,5,1573306932,"I came across this video through a Jimi Hendrix concert video search. Bought it and enjoyed it. Fun to see all the musicans in their early days. The crowd atmosphere of expecting free concerts still holds somewhat true of todays youth wanting things for nothing. A bit short on the performance time of the groups but with that many groups something needs to be cut to fit the DVD. I always wonder why producers don't ""get it"" and pack these videos with as much as possible. It's what the people want and what history demands. Oh ya, the money thing. Do it right and that will follow. Look how well Woodstock did with it's release - imagine how well it would have done with twice that footage.",1393891200,,692,4.456692913385827
191492,5,1573306932,"It is really the politics of mass rock concerts that is on center stage in this film.  The locals on the island are revealed to be completely out of touch right wing nuts.  And large elements of the crowd become organized into left-wing activism against the seemingly inept and exploitive capitalists running the concert.  The whole thing degenerates into a kind of Monty Python skit on early 70s politics -- accompanied by wonderful music.  Not only does this film have performances by great musicians of the era, including Jimi Hendrix (his next to last performance before he died), Miles Davis, the Doors, Joni Mitchell and John Sebastian.  It also has performances from groups who were big at the time but are now largely forgotten such as Ten Years After.",1392076800,,760,4.8604651162790695

191506,5,1573306932,"Murray Lerner is such an excellent cinematographer who gets behind the scenes to document everything; from clashes with police to individual philosophical interviews about the event and getting high. And his concert footage of the legends of the day is nonpareil. After reading criticism about a lack of homage paid to concert performances in this work _ and then seeing the video _ my response was totally WTF? I think this film outshines a lot of  better-known concert flicks in terms of capturing performances. And that includes ""Woodstock,"" ""The Last Waltz"" and ""Gimme Shelter."" The scope of prestigious artists at the height of their powers is transcendent. In a world of fiberglass, ""Message to Love"" is a gem.",1383350400,,716,5.067796610169491

191509,3,1573306932,"Loved the music, I'm from the era.  The problem was that it seemed like before and after every performer they complained about making it into a free concert, from both sides.  Some mention would have been OK, but this was the predominant theme throughout.  First the promoters, then the gate crashers and finally the artists.  It's been 50 years, the music is mostly dead.  It would have been nice to simply relive the nostalgia of a bygone era without all the nonsense.",1373760000,,470,4.682926829268292

191511,2,1573306932,"I recently happened across this dvd & bought it despite the various negative aspects of the reviews. I wanted to see it because I was there for the full time in 1970 (my friends & I paid to get in). After viewing the dvd I have to say that Lerner's focus & the majority of the dvd doesn't nearly reflect my experience at the festival. While we were aware of some minor conflicts with the folks outside the festival grounds, it never affected us negatively. My memories are of great music, little sleep, great music, meeting fantastic people, the great music, altered states of awareness (it was 1970 after all) and great music. Unfortunately,this dvd doesn't show much of the reason most of us were there---THE MUSIC!  Accuse me of rose-colored remembrances but Isle of Wight Festival was one of the most exciting & pleasurable events of my life & this dvd doesn't come close to reminding me of it.",1341792000,2,898,4.6125
191512,5,1573306932,"This is a one of  the best historical records of the rock music. Along with concerts as Monterey and Woodstock, the Isle of Wight Festival is an important documents that reflects the more important moments of the development of the music of the late 60's. I really enjoy this movie. Very recommendable.",1302652800,,302,4.8076923076923075
191513,3,1573306932,"OK, there's no denying this documentary does a good job of capturing the spirit of the time in which the festival occurred--we get plenty of interviews with scraggly hippies in the crowd voicing their opinions about how the concert should be free to the people and how their love for the music is being exploited by the man--yet when it comes to respectfully showcasing that very music what do we end up with? Abbreviated, often truncated versions of timeless, classic performances that I'm positive was the reason the majority of the buyers of this DVD purchased the disc in the first place.

From a bit of research, it appears this first turned up on VHS tape back in the mid-90's so its two hour length makes sense when considering the limitations of that medium (a two-hour, SP speed videotape was considered about the maximum length to get good video/audio reproduction without causing undue stress on the tape). However, when it came time to put this on DVD, it seems there was no extra effort to put out a proper release of this event, one that should have necessitated at the very least restoring the FULL-LENGTH versions of the majority of songs that appear in this movie. With all the great musical performers at this show, there is definitely a guaranteed market to return this minor investment and probably negate the very criticisms that I'm mentioning here.

Not only that, but the DVD is two-sided with each side only running an hour in length. Um, wtf? Why double-side it when a single side of a DVD can easily hold 2 hours worth of material? I know this DVD has been marked-down for sale at under $10 at most sites, so it's not a tremendous burden to purchase if you absolutely must obtain it, but still it's sad the missed opportunity they had here to release something that could have joined Gimme Shelter and Woodstock as a great document of a key musical and cultural event that was presented with the best modern technology can offer.

To quote the very words that someone voices during the film, ""we blew it.""",1293235200,,2032,4.670391061452514
191514,5,1573306932,"I own all the Woodstock videos that are out there as well as some outtake footage that I acquired. Gimmee Shelter is another side of that time period that everyone should also see, but Isle of Wight is special. Seeing ELP, Joni Mitchell, Jethro Tull and MILES DAVIS all in one  video is worth a million!!! Leonard Cohen is awesome too. Of course The Who and Hendrix gave stellar performances, as well. The whole video is a marvelous piece of historical footage that clearly shows the changing values in the world at that time and the ensuing confusion that resulted. The music was the soundtrack and it was so new, fresh, vibrant and experimental in its' creation. I am so glad the cameras were running. I highly recommend this item.",1287360000,,733,4.638461538461539
191515,5,1573306932,"Certain short moments change everything. One was when the promoters of Woodstock declared the massive concert a free show. Some say that August 1969 weekend was the apex of the hippie dream: a communal and no cost weekend of peace, love, flowers, and music.

People tend to forget that Woodstock was declared a disaster area and that the New York State National Guard was called in to distribute food. The promoters of the festival took an absolute money bath. The Who almost didn't get paid, and it was not until the film and album came out in 1970 that Wooodstock made money.

You know what else can change everything? Hell. That is how Jerry Garcia described what happened  four months later, when in December, the Rolling Stones asked the Hell's Angels to provide security at their festival at the Altamont Speedway, which they hoped would be Woodstock West. Every creepo in Calafornia seemed to show up that weekend-I love the imbecile whining outside the Stones  trailer like a three-year-old ""I wanna see Mick Jagger, G-dammit""- and were beaten with pool cues by the Angels. Paul Kantner of Jefforson Airplane got knocked out, and a fan with a gun, Maradith Hunter, was killed. To see this mess, get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gimme-Shelter/dp/B002P8O29K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gimme Shelter</a>

Yet somehow, promoters in England sought to try it all again in 1970, and thus held the Isle Of Wight Festival. This show had sets by The Who, Jimi Hendrix,The Doors, Jethro Tull, and Family, among a lot of other rock and folk royalty of the era.

These sets are documented on this  DVD, along with the behind the scenes workings of this massive undertaking.

Message To Love is a fascinating look at why the Woodstock Dream did not and could not make it past the 1960s. Not even past December 1969. Even in the counterculture days of 1970, rock royalty expected to be paid. Paid well.

The problem: fans who came to Isle of White did not seem to get that putting on a massive rock concert was a massive financial and logistical undertaking. They wanted Woodstock In England.  They wanted communal utopia. They didn't understand why they had to pay to get in.
'
Can you blame them. Maybe. Maybe not. In 1970, rock was politics, money was politics, and rock festivals were, most absolutely politics. Massive showings of hippie potential set to music. It seems laughable in 2010, but there was a real tension between hippies, capitalists, and hippie capitalists. This is best shown when Joni Mitchel sits on stage, tries to calm the crowd, make sense of what was going on.

No one was killed at Isle of Wight. There was no riot. Despite the anxiety about potential disaster that seems to run through the film, the disaster never came. Isle of Wight was unfortunately no Woodstock, and blessedly, no Altamont.

But if you enjoy the music, or if you enjoy the story, Message To Love works either way. A movie about  when rock and youth thought they could change the world, and why they actually couldn't, so very long ago.",1281744000,,3074,4.934108527131783
191516,5,1573306932,"As is true of some, or many, of the previous Amazon reviewers of this film, if  you expected it to be focused on the music being played, as he did in his films on the Who, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan (the last named at Newport), you will quite justifiably be disappointed. This is a story of an event, the gathering of 600,000, mostly young people, on an island off the coast of England, to attend a Rock Concert. It is not a filming of a Rock Concert. To my perception, there is minimal attention to that aspect of the Happening, save as it  showed something about the totality of the event. That may not be to your liking, it may be a weaker film than if it had taken the focus many potential viewers prefer, but, there you are. He made the film he set out to make (whatever may be the unexplained reasons for doing so) and forbore making the film that  he has shown  he can create with excellence.
While I, too, expected a film similar to the one on Dylan, which I saw recently, the real purpose became evident within a short time after the scene setting opening. For me the shift in direction of my attention did not frustrate me, since it gave me a chance to see what his raw materials allowed him to show about crowd events, differences in reactions among performers,and differences between performers and management. Unfortunately. he was limited by the obvious fact that it is not possible to add footage after 20 years lag (the period in which the raw film was simmering before Lerner was able to get a commission to do the job). What he had on hand was what he had to work with(and, happily, he did not interview participants twenty years after the fact which can often be an exercise in collecting distorted memories). How good is the end product. Quite good for a television special, quite inadequate for an in-depth study of interesting hypotheses which emerge from what is shown in the film. I give it an above average rating because it should be of considerable interest to viewers who have read and seen interviews and remembrances of the events, without having a chance to see any part of these events themselves.
If you want to see the largest event of its kind in Rock history, Isle of Wright had fifty percent more people than Woodstock, this is probably the best (non-fiction) film you are going to see on the subject. If you expect in-depth analysis, you will have to search the academic literature (as I have not). If, as I said before, you want an appreciable view of the music being played and sung. you will not find it here. ( I should note that this sort of gathering and psychic/emotional motivation and response, is hardly unique in history, there have been periods in American, as well as European (and other culture's)  histories, in which they were commonplace and far more intense. However, there was no motion picture camera turned on participants in these events in the 1840's, as there were on the Isle of Wight in 1970.",1262217600,,2956,4.52808988764045
191517,1,1573306932,"I could go on and on, but briefly - if you are a filmmaker and you spend 100 times more time in your film showing gatecrashers throwing rocks at a tin wall than you do Miles Davis fronting one of the greatest jazz bands of all time, or Jim Morrison or Jimi Hendrix giving their last performances, than you are an idiot. This film is an agony to watch for any true music lover. Also, one last word folks (and this is true for Altamont too), don't judge the motives of the entire love and peace generation by the results of an incompetently organized rock event. As Seth and Amy would say, ""Really!""",1258675200,6,597,4.292035398230088
191518,4,1573306932,"It says on the DVD box this film is ""highlights"" of the Isle of Wight, so that eing said, its a good highlights film.  It's 2 hours long but seeing how it was released straight to DVD, why not make it 4 hours long?
The orignal Woodstock film was 3 hours long (directors cut 40 more mins added) but the also used a double screen alot to get more in the movie, I wish this epic even was given the same treatment.
You had sych historical recordings....The Doors......Jim Morrison's last libe stage peformance and he sounded great!  Jim didn't want the spot lights in the band, so they are shown playing in almost total darkness and when they do ""The End"" it just has that great feeling to the song, I wish they showed more of the Doors or release the complete performance of them.

One thing  I like about this film was the realism, I get so sick of hearing about ""wooodstock"" that it was 3 days of Peace and LOve....BS!  The hippies crashed the fences and didn't give a crap about the promoters and other men and and women who put the festival on. Feeling they can just storm in and not have to pay for an event and just stiff the promoters to have to dig in their own pockets to pay the artists and everything else,  With Woodstock, the promoters already had a film and record deal signed and wasn't too concernd about tickets but they still took a huge financial hit, but Isle of Wight, same crap, young punks tearing down the fences to get in, too cheap tom pay 3 pounds, it wouldnt kill them, but them all crashing the fences cost the promoters their asses!

Great documentary about the so called ""love child"" generation that were just as selfish and spoiled as the ME generation, same crap, different title.

191520,4,1573306932,"There was definitely tension in the air at this festival. The movie captures this wonderfully with some great footage between the acts. Lot's of spaced out hippies wondering what is happening with their revolution...
The performances are inspired though. It's a great thing to see Miles Davis, The Doors, The Moody Blues, Kris Kristofferson, Hendrix, The Who, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen all performing at the same event. One sympathizes with Kristofferson. He couldn't seem to engage the audience at all, who were so worked up at that point that all Kris could do was walk off stage. You can pick up on the different attitudes the people had over in Europe at that time as opposed to the Woodstock footage. This crowd was angrier, and less willing to put up with with anything it seems. I can imagine that some of these people would turn to punk in the coming years. The great outdoor music festivals had run their course, I think. Though arguably there have been a handful of very successful ones since then.",1237248000,,1015,4.7727272727272725

191522,3,1573306932,"Due to numerous issues, ""Message To Love: The Isle of Wight Festival"" didn't reach theaters until 1997. Not sure if it was worth the wait. The 1970 multi-day concert it covers was so gargantuan that it would have been better served with a three-hour running time. Clocking in at 127 minutes, ""Message To Love"" feels incomplete, with multiple performers making rushed cameo appearances. Additional footage (and perhaps modern day interviews) is needed to fully detail the complex chaos of this festival.

The 1960's concert documentary first appeared on the scene with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monterey-Pop-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000E5LEWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monterey Pop - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;in 1968. Multi-day concerts were a phenomenon of the 60s, emerging from the well of youth, music and anti-Vietnam War rebellion during the Summer of Love 1967. What began with Monterey Pop arguably ended in England at this Isle of Wight Fest three years later. ""Message To Love"" is an intentional contrast to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woodstock-3-Days-of-Peace-Music-The-Director-s-Cut/dp/0790729350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woodstock - 3 Days of Peace & Music (The Director's Cut)</a>, the documentary of an equally gigantic fest held a year before in New York. By the end of that brilliant film, which runs three-plus hours, one is blissfully exhausted with the unique feeling of having been a part of those famous days. ""Message To Love"" does not capture a similar, overall essence of its event.

The film intentionally details the ugliness of what these festivals became. Promoters hoped to turn a profit, with the event attracting an astounding 600,000 British and American fans for five days of music on the island off the coast of England. Promoters designed an ill-fated system of fences, manned by guards and dogs, in an attempt to force attendees to pay admission. ""Message To Love"" accurately shows the hippie's efforts at tearing down these fences (it's always the fences). According to them, this was their ""festival"" and they were not going to participate in ""evil"" capitalism. Ironically, the bands would not perform unless paid in advance, and eventually promoter Rikki Farr (a true character) throws up his hands in frustration, accepting financial loss.

The lineup was perhaps the most interesting in history, including Jimi Hendrix&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Isle-of-Wight-70/dp/6305078971/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Isle of Wight '70</a>&nbsp;(just days before his death), The Doors&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors-Collection-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783233485/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors Collection (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;(with one of Jim Morrison's final performances), The Who&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-At-The-Isle-Of-Wight-Festival-1970-Special-Edition/dp/B000ION7CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970 (Special Edition)</a>, Miles Davis, Donovan, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Kris Kristofferson, John Sebastian and Ten Years After. Young acts on the verge of becoming 70's staples included Tiny Tim, Free (with a young Paul Rodgers), The Moody Blues, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Leonard Cohen and Jethro Tull. Additional performers, including Chicago, Melanie, Supertramp, Richie Havens and Sly & The Family Stone are sadly (and unwisely) left on the cutting room floor. With few exceptions, none of the acts are documented particularly well, and the coverage provided Davis, Donovan and Baez is criminally short. This concert was a unique musical bridge connecting the 60s to the 70s, though this is only hinted at.

The camera weaves through the audience on occasion (though not enough), mainly to the caravan of gypsy-hippies camped on the hill overlooking the festival. Most fans interviewed are British, having adopted the aura of rebellion from the States. The most violent protesters are, interestingly, the Americans. They are a rough mob threatening the guards while contemplating their own drug use (and shockingly that of their children) next to damp campfires.

With the exception of The Moody Blues'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Moody-Blues/dp/B0007NOL3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Moody Blues</a>&nbsp;performance of ""Nights In White Satin,"" the live acts are surprisingly uninspiring, owing much to the odd pillbox-like stage they were forced to perform in.

The incident reduces Mitchell to tears while backstage, in what is one of the film's most extraordinary scenes, the manic hippie, eyes dilated, spouts nonsense in an apparent acid-induced frenzy. With much trouble, he his forcefully escorted away, arms and legs flailing about.

""Message To Love"" is missing similar intimate detail to properly flesh out these closing, final days of acid and roses. There was an opportunity here for historical greatness. The great abundance of magic and misery could have been better conveyed.",1229126400,,5979,6.688545688545688

191535,5,1573306932,"I don't get the criticism of this movie. Firstly, it's damn cheap - so whatever you get is value. Secondly, I've never bothered to watch the actual movie all the way through - all I'm interested in is the music. I go straight to the titles section where you can just watch the performances uncut. That's what I wanted, and what I get is the most fantastic performances by The Who, Doors, and some bands which either aren't available anywhere else (such as Family and Ten Years After) or some bands for whom one or two performances are enough for me (such as Jimi Hendrix, Free, Taste and Leonard Cohen).

For me, that's the beauty of buying a Festival movie - fairly short clips of bands. If I want more, I buy a DVD of that band. Since buying this movie, I've been inspired to buy more by The Who and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, whereas it has put me off buying anything by Jimi, much as I like his music (on CD).",1178928000,2,910,4.2601156069364166
191536,1,1573306932,"A poorly made documentary focusing on the problems surrounding the festival's producers. Every music clip in this film has been edited down, sometimes to no more than a few seconds, so the creators of the movie could slip in a few more of the countless interviews with hippie's proclaiming the freedom of the music and the show promoters worrying over how they're going to pay the musicians and beat the bad publicity. There wasn't enough room to include a single entire performance of any song by any of the bands featured, but there's enough room to show interviews with burned out hippies in their entirety, interviews that consists mainly of babbling or long pauses while they try...to...remember...the...right...words...man.

  It's obvious that the creators of the film wanted to focus on the deterioration of the hippie generation, but if they were trying to make a statement, they were about 30 years too late. The only statement this film makes is one of frustation.

I could have done with a lot less of disgruntled hippies and more music.

1.  Half of it is concerned with the people who wanted free entry - so they weren't really a part of the festival I attended 'cos they didn't get in.

2.  The focus is on American bands while the UK bands were probably better overall.

3.  At the end when the camera zooms along the portaloos I had a lens poked into my 'booth' and told them to bugger off. I could have made the movie maybe.",1134518400,8,637,4.048

He slept through Hendrix (probably judging by the lacklustre performance a lucky break) but said that Cactus, Free and a show stopping Taste were the highlights (there was a promise that the Taste gig was to be released in full-but still nothing!) Anyway all these years later i get to see what he was on about. On the whole musically it was better than Woodstock, but at least at Woodstock you got the whole songs not a lot of edits as on this, but what you do get makes you wish for more Taste of course, Jethro Tull and a brilliant Miles Davis (edited badly) are top notch. The Doors and Leonard Cohen are uninspired and Joni Mitchell is twee. At the end i sympathised with Rikki Farr afterall he promoted the thing why should a load of grumby anarchists expect it to be free and storm the gates. I couldn't help but wish the security guard had belted the moronic American 'radical' (who probably owns real estate now)making an ass of himself by was urging the guard to hit him and felt more sympathy for the guard dog that got killed by the gate crashers. If anyone has read up on the festival the whole thing would of passed off peaceably (as the other two had) if the local council hadn't moved the site. So they were the real villians. The guy at the end who gave his kid LSD is another moron. Actually the whole film is a 'screw you' to the Woodstock generation which i never brought into, but at least 'message to Love' is an honest view of what was essentially the end of love and peace.

191555,4,1573306932,"As a documentary, this dvd is excellent.  The Isle of Wight Festival is important for several reasons, among which is that it was among the last performances of both Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix. Further, the festival was, like Woodstock and the Festival Train, an odd mix of success and failure.  Financially, these were all a failure.  In terms of demonstrating the ideals of the late '60s - that music and emotion could create something beautiful - these festivals were also (to varying degrees) a failure.  Yet, the music was fantastic and the events became living things, as important in terms of history as in art.  As this film shows, any attempt at orchestrating and scripting the event was thwarted by the ""event"" itself.  We see people appropriating the stage, tearing down walls, dancing, etc.  We see artists leave the stage in disgust and we see others plead with the audience.  We see the behind-the scenes, the organizers frustrated with artists and with the crowd.  Ultimately, we see resolution as a large number of individuals brought together finally learn to accept each other.  This is a movie without the sugar-coating and it borders on shocking at times.

In terms of the selection of artists, there are some great performances here and no single artist is really spotlighted.  I wish that there was additional footage, even as special features.  Further, the transition between the performances and the crowd (something handled very well in Woodstock - though a different director) is sometimes a bit abrupt, giving the film a bit of a choppy feel.

There are (at present) two companion films available separately, presenting the complete performances of The Who and Jimi Hendrix.  In these films, the director (Murray Lerner) likewise includes some behind-the-scenes footage of the organizers, providing some nice context, though the full meaning of these snippets is really gained after watching Message To Love.  Thus, these companion films extend Message to Love.  I would love to see more of these complete performances (Jethro Tull springs to mind, and I saw that a cd of their performance was recently released).  Further, I would like to see a box set of the Isle of Wight material - Message To Love + the complete performance materials.

Anyway, despite a bit of choppiness, I recommend this disc.  Mr. Lerner included a fine mix of major and minor (retrospectively speaking) artists and a good bit of context via the behind-the-scenes transitions.  Whereas this disc doesn't have the smoothness of Woodstock or Monterey Pop, for example, the inclusion of overlooked artists and ""the ugly side"" perhaps make this a more truthful documentary.  There are enough fine performances to please the music fan and enough context for the historian alike.",1103760000,4,2779,5.07488986784141
191556,3,1573306932,"Great Movie, but one thing is dramatically wrong.

This was not Jim Morrison's last stage performance with the Doors. It was 12/12/70 in New Orleans. So for all of you who thought is was his last...sorry!",1094774400,5,204,4.666666666666667

And the ones that are included have suffered major editing.  C'mon, guys, this was Jim Morrison's last appearance with the Doors!  Show the whole song!  This is more a documentary on the times than it is a concert film.  Such a pity.",1093824000,3,383,4.5588235294117645
191558,4,1573306932,"Most of the performances are good, although a little too brief (and some songs are probably edited), which is why I had to dock this review one star.  This is more of a documentary of the event than anything else.  You'll see the promoters and the crowd get almost as much time on the camera as the performers.  The Isle of Wight wasn't exactly Britain's answer to Woodstock (Altamont ended the Woodstock spirit and this is Hippydom's last true hurrah), but still a great festival.

This has poignant moments, like Jimi Hendrix' final performance featuring ""Message to Love,"" ""Machine Gun"" and ""Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),"" one of the Doors' final performances (Jim Morrison looks sad and out of it) featuring ""When the Music's Over"" and ""The End"" and Joni Mitchell bursting out in tears after one rambunctious hippie interrupts her set while playing ""Woodstock"" (he's lucky he didn't try interrupting the Who's set!).  She carries on singing ""Big Yellow Taxi.""  After instances like Altamont, the promoters add security like a metal fence dividing the young teens and adults (some English, some American) who've paid admission and those who haven't and police dogs.  So, naturally, there's plenty of arguments between the promoters and the music fans.  Due to the war between them, Kris Kristoferson is unduly booed onstage.  Folks are too busy trying to get in to listen to the original ""Me and Bobbie McGee.""  Joan Baez, after her performance of ""Let It Be"" is interviewed.  She's honest and says ""This is my job, so naturally, I expect to be paid.""  A humorous moment is Tiny Tim singing via megaphone ""There'll Always Be An England.""  A sad moment is when one hippie says he's given his young son LSD (nowadays, a social worker would probably take the son away from him). It's amusing to see a young thin Ian Anderson perform with Jethro Tull (""Whoever said we wouldn't perform tonight is full of..."") on ""My Sunday Feeeling"" and a young thin Paul Rogers perform ""All Right Now"" with Free.  This is also Emerson, Lake and Palmer's debut performance (each of them celebrates in full flamboyance by Emerson nearly destroying his organ, Lake setting off a cannon and Palmer removing his shirt while performing ""Pictures at an Exhibition/Blue Rondo a la Turk"").  It's also one of the Moody Blues' 1st performances live.  Fortunately for the freeloaders (nowadays one would find it extraordinary that they would spend a lot of money on crossing the boat to the Isle and not schill out 3 English pounds), the fence is taken down and all hold hands in peace, while a guitar plays ""Amazing Grace.""  You really sympathize with Rikki (one of the emcees), as he bears his heart with the audience that he and the other promoters will have lots of fees to pay for this decision.  As the festival comes to end, Rikki later sums it all up when he says ""This is the last great event.""  One of the carpenters looks a little like Jerry Garcia!

An edition with more complete performances would be great in the future.  In the meantime, this will have to do.  By the way, this is a 2 sided disk (at least my copy is) and if it ends with Joni Mitchell singing ""Big Yellow Taxi,"" turn the disk over and you'll get Miles Davis and the rest of the program.",1085270400,50,3240,4.717584369449378

191560,4,1573306932,"This DVD should be required viewing for any sociologist interested in the 1960s/70s. Here we get a fascinating clash between dopeheads, anarchists and hippies demanding a free concert, whereas their pop music heroes are demanding to be paid before they perform.
Tiny Tim comes off particularly badly, saying to camera that he thinks a free concert is a great idea. But then the concert organiser admits that Tiny Tim won't pick up his ukulele until he gets paid. Joan Baez is more honest and less two-faced about it, but she has no solution to the financial problem. She does expect to get paid.
Eventually the rabble wins and, after clashes with police dogs etc, tears down the corrugated metal fences. Even the concert promoter's spokesman finally admits defeat and says everyone can come in, now that they know they'll never break even.
Sociologists may well wince along with most viewers when one dopehead admits that he gives his young son (who looks about five) marijuana and LSD.
But what a fantastic concert it was. Quite apart from this providing the last ever appearances by Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there were also some superb performances, particularly by the Who. (The interplay between drummer Keith Moon and guitarist Pete Townshend is telepathic.) Free are OK, but they are not well-miked. There is also the humdrum: Rory Gallagher with a very mediocre song, an extended Miles Davis band (which included Chick Corea and possibly Keith Jarrett) providing an excerpt which was all too brief. Joni Mitchell deserved gets two songs on this DVD, after telling the crowd that they are behaving like tourists.
There is the nudity and unscripted on-stage behaviour that you might expect from crowds of the period. But what this film does so well is focus not just on the dirtiness of attending an outdoor concert for several days, but also on the problems of managing the event.

191562,5,1573306932,"In 1969 Woodstock was the first event of it's kind and a year later the even bigger Isle of Wight Festival was the last. This rockumentary released 25 years after the event is in the vein of 'Woodstock', only better. What sets this apart is the music. The movie gives pretty even coverage to both the music and capturing the hippy vibe of the event. There is a constant tension created by the barrier surrounding the event and the thousands who came without the price of admission. This is similar to what happened at Woodstock but it plays out slightly differently here. The coverage of this tension and the unique festive atmosphere is compelling watching but it is the music that takes center stage. Never was there such a collection of rock icons together at a single event as at the Isle of Wight and this includes the last concert performances by Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrision. Hendrix died a mere 18 days afterwards. The complete lineup of performances in this movie are as follows:
  Jimi Hendrix - Message to love
  The Who - Young man
  Free - All right now
  Taste (Rory Gallagher) - Sinner Boy
  Tiny Tim - There'll always be an England
  John Sebastian - Red Eye Express
  Donovan - Catch the wind

  The Doors - The End Jimi
  Hendrix - Foxy Lady

191563,4,1573306932,"This DVD is a must have for both young and old who want to see what pretty much caused the end of the ""Peace and Love"" era.  If your looking for a movie that features only the artist, then you might be disappointed, but is an excellent source of seeing both the artist and the people (good or bad) during the end run of the era.  As the festival organizer said at the end of the festival, 'It's really sad.  Because of what took place here, we'll never see the likes of this again.""  He was so right, even Woodstock II could never recapture the flavor of the '60's.
There however were some exceptional performances by many artists, many who are no longer with us and need to be seen.  Some performances were edited and cut short, but then again, how do you as a filmaker try to fit a weekend into a presentable time contraint for viewing.  Taking this into consideration, they did a good balance between the performers and the 'gate crashers' and the audience.  This is a documentary more than a rock show.
In August of 1970 - the same time as the Isle of Wight festival, I was at the Sky-River Rock Festival outside the little town of Washougal, Washington.  This festival was much different than the Isle of Wight in that there were only 30-40 thousand people and there was still the presence of peace and love and everyone shared whatever they had with their neigbors next to them.  The only fatality during the whole weekend was an elderly man who was leaning over a bridge with binoculars trying to get a look at some hippy chicks skinny dipping in the river, fell over and hit his head on a rock and drowned.  I don't remember any gate crashers and if there was, I think most of the people would have looked down on them.  Yes, bands need to eat, the carpenters who build the stage, the permits etc., etc. all cost money, so why shouldn't people pay to go??
This is deffinately worth buying, but I'd HIGHLY recomend starting out with the Complete Monterey Pop Festival DVD, when and where 'it' all begin.  Sure wish I had been there...!!",1071360000,,2043,4.418666666666667

Add to that the interesting, and, somehow amusing interviews held by director Murray Lerner with the flower children, and you'll get a pretty decent and fascinating picture of the hippies culture, style and way of life back in 1970, a naive view which said it's all there for the take. The only thing that's missing is the music. Lerner and his crew seemed to forget something along the way. There is simply not enough music, and many parts were brutaly cut out and heavily edited. Lerner was, sometimes, concentrating too much in the never ending disputes
and conflicts between the long haired Marijuana and L.S.D struck hippies which refused paying the 3 pounds admission and the festival promoters and their helpless, useless security stuff.

Most of this stuff is just plain depressing, and on first viewing seems annoyingly obtrusive - you just want to get onto the next snatch of music! Taken as a whole, though, it does help to set these amazing performances into the real context in which they were delivered, and ultimately the film is more rewarding if you can keep your finger off the fast-forward button and just experience the whole thing. Musical highlights abound: the Who at their incendiary best, Hendrix displaying a nonchalant brilliance which was his alone, Alvin Lee and Kieth Emerson whipping up respective storms with their crowd-pleasing techniques, Leonard Cohen by contrast the introspective poet of gloom (but still the crowd seem to hang onto every word), Joni Mitchell fighting back the tears and demanding some respect and singing like an angel, Jim Morrison being magnificent, Taste - I'd forgotten what a great blues band they were - Free, Moody Blues, Tull..all delivering the goods. In between you get bursts of aggression, frustration, downright unpleasantness and quite a few eccentric characters expressing their opinions on the events unfolding around them. One thing for sure, it'll never happen again. For all its shortcomings, this is a fascinating film and a great companion to Woodstock - the Movie.",987033600,3,1636,5.200757575757576
191599,1,1573306932,"I had the honor of seeing and hearing some of the music at this concert, and the lousy editting just to get more on the DVD was pathetic. It seems  all the record company and releaser of the video was interested in was the  almighty dollar, NOT the quality of the music. For instance Ten Years  After.. over six miuets of the best guitar work cut out of the release. If  you can get the Isle Of Wight Atlanta Pop Festivals record you'll see what  I mean. This release is DISGUSTING>",966384000,10,482,4.252747252747253
191600,3,1573306932,"The big difference between this movie and Woodstock:  Woodstock had the non-musical footage serving as interludes to the performances.  Here the impression I get is largely the opposite, although there is quite a bit of  music seen and/or heard throughout the film.
The talent roster is  roughly equal between the two festivals (Jimi Hendrix appeared at both).  However, I think fans of most of the MESSAGE TO LOVE artists will be irked  by how little screen-time that most of the musicians receive.  For example,  I am a disappointed Miles Davis fan (his segment lasts about a minute),  while the footage of another of my musical favorites (Joni Mitchell) is  preoccupied with her tearful reaction to an impatient crowd rather than her  music.
Too many of the featured artists (Tull, Miles, Joni, etc.) have  loyal followings that would warrant an alternative multi-volume edition  featuring their complete performances (this has already happened with sets  by Hendrix and The Who).  That would release this movie from the inflated  expectations of fans who've waited up to a quarter-century to hopefully see  significant chunks of the artists' sets.  We could then be more receptive  to the story the film-makers are trying to tell.",963705600,40,1234,5.141414141414141
191601,5,1573306932,"In general, I think it's a remarkable video.  To think that the video was locked up in someone's vault for so many years is un-thinkable.

My only disappointment is that there is too much focus on the events rather  than the musical performances.  Although, the back stage antics are great.  A lot of the music performances are extremely edited-down (as one reviewer  noted). Because of that,  I am bothered by one question. ""What other  master-pieces remain hidden inside that vault?""  I can only help but  feel unfulfilled.  For I'm sure that there is more footage out there.  Strange enough, additional ""private"" releases have begun to  ""slowly"" appear after this film became public.  From artists such  as Jimi Hendrix & The Who.  ...But, where are the rest?

It's  obvious that there is more corporate dealings going on yet.  Squeezing out  what ever pennies that can be scrounged through the resource of the tapes.  Taking advantage of the hungry mouths & pockets of the public.  They  very thing that was revolted against by the majority of those who witnessed  the event.  I think they ought to change the title to ""Message To  Money"" instead.  However, I admit that I am one of those hungry ones.  Aching to see a more complete performance of that venue.  Other than what  was offered & poorly represented in the video.  Like Donovan's  performance which lasted only three seconds.  And what about Tony Joe  White, Melanie, Cactus, & Procol Harum who weren't even included?  I  have yet to see the complete performance of ELP's debut of ""Pictures  At An Exhibition"".  ...I'm wondering if such footage even exists?

I guess my message here is to say that ""there ought to have been  a more complete video made of this event!""  Perhaps a sequel?

I  also like to say, ""hurry up on those new releases!""  ...That is  if any exist?

A year after Woodstock, this Festival had even more people and had the last big appearance of Hendrix in England.  It also had, unfortunately, a fair share of those children who demanded that all concerts were to be held free of charge, and were willing to act as vandals in order to get their point across.  Thankfully, those people did not ruin the music, even if they did upset several of the artists.",1521158400,,582,4.471698113207547

This is the concert where Canadian folkie songstress Joni Mitchell called out the revelers' lack of respect for those onstage and called them all mere ""tourists"" as she called them to respect the talent.  Along with Ms. Mitchell's singing prowess, other major acts such as The Doors, The Moody Blues, Kris Kristofferson, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, and many others singers and bands perform in this ""rockumentary"" that a) showed the folly of baby boomer free love/communal hippie ideals and b) was not edited into any kind of final form or released until over 20 years after the Isle of Wight festival took place.

So purchase a copy of ""Message to Love"", see how the fallacy about hippie ideals caught up with reality and killed the dreams of a generation... and enjoy the rockin' folly!",1496707200,,1329,5.036363636363636

Not about the music, but rather the plight of the sponsors who are dealing with a crowd that doesn't want to pay to get in. The performances are poor, the camera work is bad, and the format is the usual ""documentary"" style of half-songs and interruptions that make one suspect that the drama of the freeloaders, along with some gratuitous nudity, was made the focus of the film because decent footage of the complete performances doesn't exist. The only decent moment of the film is watching a lean and hairy Paul Rodgers fronting Free for one of the few mostly complete songs on offer here. No emphasis or mention is made in the film of the real historical value here - the last performances of Jimi and Morrison with the Doors. To top it off, my copy was on one of those irritating flippy DVDs which don't tell you which side is up.
