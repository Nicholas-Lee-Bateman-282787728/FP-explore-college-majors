8004868,1,B0000ZI1A6,"The presentation and promotion of this DVD does not mention the fact that this is a recording of the Artist's 1986 concert in Japan, and also not in full, which was released in full as DVD by Immortal as IMM 940099 - also available from Amazon. The Japanese subtitles suggest that this is a recording from a Telecast, rather than Immortal's apparent recording in the auditorium. This sort of sales practice should not be encouraged, and we - the consumers - can make our opinions register by the like of this sort of cheats by buying elsewhere. Amazon - please remove this listing from your website.",1164412800,21,599,4.660377358490566
8004869,3,B0000ZI1A6,"Not enough can be said/done to educate the casual reader about Fado/Amelia Rodrigues within the confines of a review. Thus, let's proceed with the rationale for giving this DVD only 3 stars:

This is a live recording from a concert Amalia Rodrigues gave in the '80's in Japan. The image doesn't seem to look well on the traditional TV's aspect ratio. Japanese captioning adds to the sense of frustration of the non-Japanese viewer. Amalia's performance is rather ordinary, and camera work and sound are barely acceptable as presented on the disc. If the producer of this DVD had done more than to transfer from a Japanese master video tape straight on DVD it would be too bad for his effort since it doesn't show.

Too bad for those who approach(ed) this edition with an above-average sense of anticipation; disappointment looms around...",1097193600,18,838,4.9361702127659575
