8433928,4,B004L8MGA4,"The real life jodi of Ajay Devgn and Kajol team up yet again, this time in an animation flick. Earlier they were seen in Ajay Devgn's home production, U ME AUR HUM back in 2008. TOONPUR KA SUPERRHERO is also India's first live action - 3D animation combination feature film.

The animation quality of TOONPUR KA SUPERRHERO is majestic. It's at least at par with if not better than Hollywood films. The characters and the entire world of TOONPUR are fabulously designed. It's an interesting blend of live action and 3D animation.

On the flip side, the film is marred by a weak script. The story is pretty ordinary isn't engaging enough. Also, the humour quotient is too low. It isn't bad, but the funny dialogues and punches are very scarce. You endlessly wait for something interesting to happen but only end up getting disgruntled. Barring the riveting gaming climax in which Aditya takes on the toonasurs, the graph of the narrative is pretty mediocre.

Some of the characters are cheekily designed on famous real and reel life characters. There's a singer Gappi resembling Bappi Lahiri, who not only sings like him but also sports jewellery. A police officer speaks like Baburao Ganpatrao Apte, a celebrated character essayed by Paresh Rawal in HERA PHERI.

TOONPUR KA SUPERRHERO isn't 'super' and nowhere close to it, but do visit TOONPUR for its splendid animation if you must.",1300665600,,1383,4.872340425531915
