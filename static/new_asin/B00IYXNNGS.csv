8646643,4,B00IYXNNGS,"According to the data on the back of the DVD the creator of this product says they received this from a North Korean in South Korea and was tasked to translate it and put it on the net to be viewed by anybody that wanted to view it.  (???)

This is an attack upon virtually the whole globe of Capitalism/commercialism/celebrity. For the first half hour it is interesting, then it rambles and demonizes...Madonna, Arnold, Michael Jackson, Brad and Angolina, Britney Spears, Tyra Banks, American Presidents, and... horrors WWE!

The thing is it shows images that I do not think a resident of North Korea would even be aware of, which makes me wonder if this is a Michael Moore production that is out to demonize the West. Surreal. Some unpleasant scenes.",1517616000,,752,4.7251908396946565

8646646,5,B00IYXNNGS,"One of my favorite propaganda films, the conceit behind this movie and its release was terrific. I'll try to avoid spoilers about that part. It was uploaded onto YouTube in ten parts about four years ago. I didn't come across it until two years later. It just showed up in my feed or I still wouldn't know about it. I've watched it numerous times just to study the way it's cut, written, and timed, and lament that I know so little about film making in order to understand those aspects better. I did take classes on advertising, mass comm, and persuasion as an undergrad, though, and the film is dynamic in those areas. After seeing it so many times for free, I had to buy a copy just out of guilt.

The description on the DVD case says that ""Sabine,"" a pseudonymous interpreter, was approached by two unnamed North Korean defectors when she went on a visit to Seoul. They gave her the film and asked that she translate and release it to the world, which she did.

It purports to be a North Korean propaganda film about the west, depicting the worst sins of the U.S. government since WWII, although the British, Israeli, Australian, and other governments also come in for their fair share of hits. For the most part, the charges against these countries are supported by easily-obtainable evidence. There are some errors, though, and the Great Leader stuff is funny throughout. It goes completely off the rails when it insists that Truthers are correct in assuming that 9/11 was a false flag operation by the Bush Administration.

Yet this is a meta-propaganda movie, too, and that paranoiac thinking style might be deliberate - a false flag of its own, if you will. There's no way to know what the filmmaker hoped the audience would do with it. He seems to try very hard to get us to evaluate not just individual allegations, but the film as a whole, and where it fits into mass communication. The nature and use of propaganda is the subject here, not his opinion about ""celebrity"" for no reason; endless unprovoked foreign entanglements; fashion trends; planned obsolescence, and convincing us that we'd be more desirable if we bought a BMW or that new toothpaste. We know where he stands on all of them, but the bigger question is where does he believe information ends and manipulative propaganda begins? And which is he trying to do here, if either?

Some things might be deliberately (or inadvertently?) funny, but I'm issuing a stern warning now. There are some scenes that show graphic war wounds; charred children, and the death/dying of humans and animals, such as gruesome fur trade victims and a shocking glimpse of shoveling Holocaust victims' bodies onto pallets. I urge you to look away immediately when such scenes begin. They're only seconds long, so I might have a fainter heart than most, but they were (still are) deeply disturbing. They aren't gratuitous, though; they're integral to the movie and its purpose. Without them, the movie would be a mouth with molars and no incisors, suitable only for chewing hot cereal - and this film isn't cream of rice.

Try your best to buy it first, watch it without researching anywhere on line about it, and only later look up further details. It's a film-lover's delight, but could easily induce nightmares. It's hyperbolic, conspiratorial, cruel, and utterly true, all at once. I can't recommend it more highly, nor tell you to avoid it more forcefully. Enter at your own risk.

When we watch the movie, a mysterious unnamed man (with a blurred-out face) explains to the audience how propaganda works - specifically how principles of modern advertising are used by the state, church, and corporate-statist powers to brainwash regular citizens in western democracies that they are truly free. This propaganda is then used to recruit soldiers to engage in wars that benefit the rich under the guise of protecting liberty. It also recruits consumers into buying goods and services they have no need for, further lining the 1%'s pockets.",1475107200,3,3995,4.824817518248175
