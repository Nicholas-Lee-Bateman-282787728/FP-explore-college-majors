8370042,1,B002GUGQHI,"This DVD has production values reminiscent of 1950's local TV broadcasts.  It might be the worst ever put on DVD!  Shaky, tilting (drunken?) camera work. Colors of yellow and brown.  Image only fills a small portion of the screen, further reduced by amateurish vignetting.  Content is even worse:  two modern food factory tours, a nasty-looking man preparing nasty food in a nasty kitchen, talking head narration -- which lasts forever.  Very little of the Christkindlesmarkt.  Stick with Rick Steves' Christmas DVD.",1356652800,,516,5.296296296296297
