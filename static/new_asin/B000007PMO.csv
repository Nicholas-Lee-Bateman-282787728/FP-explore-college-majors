That the Buffalo is the toughest game animal is contested by almost no one. So it's pretty hard to make a bad video about hunting Buffalo.  And this video is just that: not bad.
The video begins with a concise geographical overview of Botswana and the area to be hunted, in this case the famous Okavango delta. Next begins the first instance of what I consider the video's biggest weakness: somewhat excessive and uninformative talking during which the English language occasionally gets tortured.
Two nice Buffalos are taken, one by McNeely one by another hunter. Both Buff show the exemplary character and resilience for which they are famous.  Under the circumstances the cameraman does a fair, if not great job of getting the &#8220;moment of truth&#8221; on film. Most PH's put a cameraman on a pretty short leash hunting dangerous game.
After each Buffalo shooting sequence there is excessive almost clownish handshaking, backslapping and general congratulatory BS during which time the native staff slap the dead animal, poke it in the eye (the official way to make sure it's really dead) and in one case walk on it during which time McNeely obsesses over the awesomeness of the animal, the overall experience and what a wonderful time he's having. The PH, who seems a little uncomfortable on film is of little help.
While there can be little doubt that hunting African game is an awesome experience the better videos let the experience speak for itself and discussion is edited to be interesting or it is limited. Mr. McNeely's Namibia Safari video, &#8220;African Safari&#8221; is a good example of a better video as are most of the Peter Hathaway Capstick videos.
The video is also not just about hunting Buffalo.  Several other species are taken including an enormous Sitatunga. Also, for the first time that I've seen it a hunter actually shoots a hyena for some purpose other than using it as cat bait.
Lots of nice scenery and some footage of giraffes and elephants and a few other animals. Sound riflemanship, particularly if you've an eye for detail. A pretty good video, especially for [the price].",990835200,,2270,4.952755905511811
