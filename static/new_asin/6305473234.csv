7890192,3,6305473234,"Is this weird film by Petr Weigl worth seeing once? Absolutely, if only to wonder what on earth can be going on in it. Is it worth keeping for your collection? Not if it is your only recording of this great song cycle by Franz Schubert; it is not worth rehearing to for the musical values alone. And probably not for the visual elements either, ravishing though these are, unless you are the kind of person who likes to immerse yourself in puzzles with no clear solution.

One of the musical problems is purely technical: the sound track is recorded at such a low level that I had to push the volume control to full to have any decent listening experience at all -- though at least the sound is clean and could take this amount of amplification. A second oddity is that the cycle, which normally tells of a young man's despairing flight after being betrayed by his sweetheart, is sung by a woman. This particular woman, the great mezzzo-soprano Brigitte Fassbaender, is always interesting, especially in her lower register. Her subtle modifications of rhythm, starting a word a tiny bit late here or holding it a hair longer there, are always in the service of Wilhelm M&uuml;ller's text, which comes over with clarity and meaning. But she was past her prime when she recorded this, and her high notes and dramatic climaxes are seldom pretty. The playing by pianist Wolfram Rieger is excellent.

You could say that those musical issues are all in service to Weigl's visual concept. While Fassbaender's singing is not always beautiful, it is certainly dramatic. The low volume makes this into a narrative with musical inspiration, as opposed to a recital with visual accompaniment. And the choice of a woman to sing a man's words removes all gender polarization, allowing Weigl to tell several stories simultaneously, with women as well as men traveling in the same coach along a winter road.

I came upon this movie through a single song (""Der Lindenbaum"") that someone has posted on YouTube (I'll give the URL in a note). Despite the poor video quality of the posting (far less good than the actual DVD), it fascinated me. It began with a nun (Fassbaender) in a deserted barn, with two angels hovering in the background. Then in short succession came a ballerina dancing on a period stage, an older woman watching from the audience accompanied by a wide-eyed child, a knight in scarlet tunic and silver armor, and another man looking on from the theater wings. What they were all doing, I have no idea -- and still don't, even after seeing the whole movie. But the filming was so good, the faces so enigmatic, the sense of period so perfect, that I could not turn away. And when I say sense of period, I do not mean mere accuracy of physical detail -- though that is impeccable -- but the ability to get into the period mind. The scene throbbed with images of the Romantic imagination, like nothing I have ever seen. That none of the images had any connection to the words of this particular poem hardly seemed to matter, so poetic was the overall experience.

In the complete film, Weigl adds to these qualities, but neither elucidates nor erases them. There are several more characters in the coach: a mother with a dying girl, an elegant young woman, a handsome dragoon, a whore, and an old organ-grinder. There is a man galloping across the countryside on a black charger. And there are many scenes which I assume are flashbacks; I can't be sure. One, for example, involves the elegant woman walking down through a meadow to a river where she sees a young man bathing. Is this adultery, fantasy, or desire? I can't be sure. There are moments, for example, when one or other begins to undress, but the two remain on opposite banks and the next scene shows them dressed again. But how they look at each other! The whole movie is charged with these silent enigmatic looks, whether of shared history, desire, or disdain. There are stories here to be teased out, certainly, and probably interesting ones. But I am by no means confident that I would succeed in elucidating them, even on several viewings.",1510444800,2,4103,4.6865464632454925
7890193,4,6305473234,Excellent performance coupled with interesting images. Sound is unfortunately at least 9dB under what is needed not to saturate any audio amp.  A crying shame!,1481760000,,159,5.36
7890194,4,6305473234,"Highly entertaining and iconic work on Schubert. There are his nervous wakeups, the mysterious women, the persiflage of the doppelgaenger/wanderer. The two friends telling the story are suave and soothing. This is the best of the series.",1424217600,,237,5.4324324324324325
7890195,4,6305473234,"While I am not normally a fan of ""Romantic Era"" music, this represents a fascinating and provocative interpretation of his lyrical tone poem, for that is what it is to me.  I'm not sure I fully understand Weigl's interpretive film, it is interesting and keeps one's attention throughout.  I viewed it as soon as I received the DVD and readily recommend it to anyone who enjoys Ingemar Bergman's films (sp?).",1376352000,,407,4.8
7890196,3,6305473234,"Beautiful music, of course. Abstract and disconnected imagery, loosely defining the text. Male and female nudity. A fig leaf covers the man parts, frontal nudity for the female, in case you are a parent getting this for classical family viewing. Lots of lusting fantasy. Since it wasn't rated, and we were surprised and somewhat embarrassed as our 10 year old and grandpa sat to watch the film, I thought I'd share the content and rate it for Amazon customers' benefit. Weird foreign film type thing, but certainly worth listening to. She has a beautiful voice and lovely expression.",1361750400,,583,4.959183673469388
7890197,3,6305473234,"Franz Schubert's collection of songs, known by their collective title, Die Winterreise, or The Winter Journey, is arguably the greatest themed group of songs ever written. They can be heard and enjoyed singly, or as a series of songs sharing a unifying theme. I think the entire collection is more meaningful than it's parts. I have treasured several recordings of Schubert's masterpiece and looked forward to experiencing Petr Weigl's filmed version. I thought Weigl's film of A Village Romeo and Juliet was beautiful and touching. His television production of A Turn of The Screw was well done, but his desire to act as auteur in interpreting Schubert songs has led him astray. His translation of the text omits numerous images and thoughts that give the songs much of their depth. And
his selection of the superb German mezzo soprano Brigitte Fassbaender to give voice to the songs was a sad mistake, bringing no credit to Fassbaender or himself. I'm not opposed to creative changes to established master pieces, but casting a woman in a role that so deeply reflects male emotions and syntax comes off as an ego-driven attempt to bring un-needed clarity to words and music that is already profound.",1325116800,,1201,4.980099502487562
7890198,5,6305473234,"OH MY GOODNESS! 10 stars!  This ART film begins with the framework of a flawless interpretation of Schuberts work by mezzo Brigitte Fassbaender, and a brilliant and relevatory interpretation of the piano part (I can't find the name of the pianist).  I found myself hearing phrasing in the piano that others simply have not found, and when you hear them, you just think - ""that's it!""

That is merely the bones that this film is hung on.  The pictures are the essence of film, a story with no dialogue, the stories are not literal interpretations off the lyrics at all, rather they are variations on the themes as told by a a narrator/nun with background figures that evoke a medeival tapestry come to life.

This is not meant to be literal, or a recital, it is a work of art springing from the music.  I find that the various story lines give freshness to the original that can be to monolithically dark.  The best element, to me, is that Weigl ""gets"" that this story is ultimately a story of regeneration and hope, and as that message of caring for others more than self makes perfect sense of the nun telling the story.  Simply beautiful.  Not a concert piece, so prepare yourself for an art show set to music.  Not for everyone, but....Marvelous!",1229817600,4,1249,4.585585585585585
7890199,1,6305473234,"The picture of this VHS is wrong. This is not SINFONIA D'AMORE with the baritone Gino Bechi.
I was looking for this movie but difficult to find.",1170115200,,144,4.37037037037037
7890200,5,6305473234,"I have owned this dvd for many years.  I didn't like it at first found the images beautiful but fussy.  I don't mind the Shubert being sung by a woman.  And in fact Fassbender's singing is great.

I gradually warmed to the CD over the period I've owned and and now I welcome an opportunity to play it.

The images that accompany the music, carry many stories with them not just one and they are related to the music, just not in an obvious way.

Buy this DVD and let the whole seep in over the course of years ... it's worth it.",1101600000,9,528,4.077669902912621
