8703376,4,B00TZ0AY2K,"'Lost Rivers' is an interesting documentary about the surprisingly common occurrence of forgotten rivers and streams running under the streets of cities around the world. These waterways were mostly covered over after they were converted into sewage waterways, to deal with the attendant smells and health risks. Others were covered to make room for highways, or for various other now questionable reasons. But now a number of cities are re-opening these treasures, cleaning them up, creating natural space for animals and people. It also examines those who get obsessed with exploring the covered water/sewer systems (calling themselves 'drainers'), often in violation of the law, and how they become passionate advocates for the waterways, along with the sometimes striking and ancient architecture buried with them.

Never dull, but in the end, be aware that there's not a lot of emotion to the film. It's like an informative illustrated lecture. It's an interesting, even eclectic overview, but it's not a film I'd feel the need to see again.",1485216000,,1046,5.301204819277109

8703378,5,B00TZ0AY2K,"Excellent documentary, and to risk a lawsuit from FOX NEWS, it is fair and balanced.  Historical and claustrophobic (people go where I would not be brave enough to go) and then up-to-date.  Every city planner and environmentalist should watch this one.",1430956800,,252,5.121951219512195
