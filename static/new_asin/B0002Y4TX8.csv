2140847,5,B0002Y4TX8,"This DVD set really has the details. If you are a fan of the show, you know that the hosts have changed but the home improvement experts remain. I recommend this DVD set to anyone who owns a house and is interested in how it works or could work better. The DVDs contain all the broadcast shows (26) of the first season of Ask This Old House, plus a nice compilation of home improvement tips and frequently asked questions on the fourth disc. The true genious behind this series is the real life problems that these experts solve. A plumbing and heating expert, a general contractor and a landscaper contractor are the main three experts that answer every day questions. Hosted by Steve Thomas, guest experts join in to solve problems that give me energy to tackle projects around the house. The series This Old House was beginning to get beyond my abilities as a do it yourself homeowner, and Ask This Old House brings it back to smaller, weekend type projects. The discs are well organized with a nice table of contents printed on the inner DVD holder. However, that is where the printed material ends; all other information is inside the DVDs. I believe a small booklet that shows more detail for navigation of the four discs would be appropriate, especially listing all the tips included on the fourth disc.",1099785600,19,1310,4.650862068965517
2140858,5,B0002Y4TX8,My favorite part about this set is that you can watch just segments of a show that deal with a topic that interests you. You don't have to watch the whole episode to get just the three minutes of info you need.,1308614400,,210,4.023809523809524
2140859,5,B0002Y4TX8,"If you love This Old House as I do, you'll love Ask This Old House.  Simplified answers to homeowner's questions provide a great way to learn new skills.  I'm very pleased with this series.",1274054400,,189,4.529411764705882
2140860,5,B0002Y4TX8,"I've always enjoyed videos that help the do-it-yourselfer.  This program in general has always been a big help.  I liked the idea of getting to have a DVD at home that I can refer back to on occasion and I definitely have used it.  If you don't want to pay for the DVD, you can always review these videos on the [...] website.  Once again, Amazon came out with the best price for this video when I compared it to Walmart and other stores.",1265068800,,438,4.178571428571429

2140862,5,B0002Y4TX8,"I really like this video. Its old information, but there is always something to learn from these guys. Its just general helpful information, not very detailed, so don't expect to find detailed info for a specific project. Really entertaining to watch.",1240617600,,251,5.146341463414634
2140863,4,B0002Y4TX8,My father loves the old series so I thought I'd get him the first season of the new one. Don't know if he actually likes it or not but it looked like something he would like.,1232668800,,174,3.861111111111111
2140864,5,B0002Y4TX8,"First let me talk about Ask This Old House, I have quickly become addicted to this show.  I never really watched it until recently, but I'm glad to have discovered it because I never knew what I was missing.  It's one of the, if not the best home improvement show I've ever seen.  The show takes place in New England and you are joined by some familiar faces from This Old House.  The cast is a great mix of a few different gentlemen who not only are super good at what they do, they also bring great personalities to the show.  When you watch this show you really become excited about home improvement and home repair in general.  You really see how a lot of things that might have seemed confusing and overwhelming at one time now seem much more simple, and you also learn which things are probably best left to a professional.  You also get to see some great historic homes and a lot of the outdoor beauty that New England offers.  I stumbled upon this first season by accident, but it's some of the best money I've ever spent.  The only thing I'm curious about is why have they not released anything beyond the first season?  Once you watch the first season it leaves you wanting more, I could watch this show all day and I'm sure others feel the same way.  Here's a petition I created for those of us who want more seasons released, stop by and sign it if you have a moment.  After so much time I'll send a copy of the petition to This Old House television.  I sure hope we see more seasons soon!

2140865,5,B0002Y4TX8,"Addictive to watch the first time.  Later, when you want to go back and watch that certain project/repair again, no problem cause the DVD's have a nice and quick ""project index"".  WORTH EVERY PENNY!",1216339200,2,198,4.794117647058823

2140878,5,B0002Y4TX8,"Ok Guys you proved your point we loved the first season and now we are ready for more!!! Lets get going guys, we need to be fed more info and tips like only you guys can do!!!  We thirst for your knowledge !! OK OK maybe im laying it on a little thick here but the truth is we are really looking forward to the next in this series of instructional DVDs.  This is a great set and I'm sure the next one will be just as good.",1183334400,3,422,3.784090909090909
2140879,3,B0002Y4TX8,"There's a lot of overlap and redundancy, as befits a Complete Set; perhaps a Best of the First Season would be more useful. I also found the ""What is This?"" segments to be worthless, verbose and tiresome. I understand that in a half hour weekly show the segment is more for filler but in the dvd set, it should have been excluded in lieu of more useful information. They introduce an obscure product of questionable value or usefulness to most people,  and then take 5 minutes to finally tell you what it is after, each of the guys guesses something silly; it's definitely the worst part of the series. You will definitely learn how to sweat a pipe, as it's a prominent part of the series. I also think more editing in general would be beneficial to include more 'meat' and substance. They seem to take a tour of everyone's house before getting to the problem: This is the living room, this is the dining room, boring, repetitive and not germane. Save your money and buy the Taunton Press book Renovation 3rd Edition. It is well worth the money...this series, isn't. What I'd like to see is a complete DVD collection of all the This Old House Series, now that would be worth owning.",1177718400,2,1182,4.5233644859813085
2140880,5,B0002Y4TX8,I purchased these DVD's for my son who is employed in the construction trades.  He found this product a superb help in his work efforts especially when doing service calls for his company!  This is an excellant product!,1175126400,2,219,4.7368421052631575
2140881,5,B0002Y4TX8,"For a self-empowered DIY with no history of success in actually DIY, this series of DVDs stand as enlightening and rewarding.  Numerous home improvement manuals and repair guides line the shelf of my bookcase, but seeing and hearing about how to do things and how to go about thinking about repairs and doing things became for me a priceless experience.  I encourage all who have never known which end of a hammer to pick up to watch these to fully appreciate the age old adage---knowledge is power!",1163721600,5,499,4.724137931034483
2140882,5,B0002Y4TX8,"We bought this DVD as entertainmnet for our 3-year-old son--an avid This Old House fan, believe it or not--for a semester we were spending in The Netherlands.  He, predictably, has loved it.  And we, his parents, have loved it too.  It offers plenty of information on how to fix small, and a few large, home projects.  Though I might not be completely comfortable installing a washing machine shut-off valve or a new window all by myself, I'll know what my fix-it guy (or woman) is talking about, questions I'll want to ask, and what to look for.  I think this is an excellent DVD set to give has a housewarming gift--and if you're looking for a birthday present for the tool enthusiast toddler set, this is a great one!",1162512000,4,720,4.550387596899225
2140883,5,B0002Y4TX8,"Really great!  I loved watching them grind out that stump and lifting up a house to stop doors from sticking. I should send gift copies to my neighbors so I can enjoy watching (other) people work while indulging my spring fever.  It's full of useful information on all sorts of things related to home repair

and gives a good idea on how many things you can handle yourself if you have the ambition and can absorb the know-how from watching Steve and Tom and Richard and the rest of the gang.",1148428800,4,492,4.384615384615385

2140885,3,B0002Y4TX8,"I really like the diversity of project topics, but many projects while informative; were focused on home maintenance. I was a bit disappointed by the DVD; perhaps because I was looking for something that was focused on basic home remodeling.

In 4 DVD's there were precious few projects that an aspiring-to-intermediate level home owner/remodeler would find of much value. Here's what was missing: No drywall installation; No basic home electrical; No basic plumbing/fixtures; No kitchen remodeling; no construction layout and framing (room additions); and no roofing repairs. If you're looking for specific direction on these important topics, my advice is to look elsewhere.

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of techniques to learn from this DVD set, but if you're looking for a broad range of home remodeling topics; you won't find it here.",1115596800,13,847,5.266666666666667
2140886,5,B0002Y4TX8,"This 4 disc DVD set of ""Ask This Old House"" is well worth the selling price.  Learning just one thing from these guys can keep you from having to hire a contractor and save you thousands of dollars in home repairs.  Tons of topics are covered and most anyone can learn to repair and maintain their home from these guys.

Wonderfully indexed, you can look up almost all the home improvement projects that they took on that season (2002).

I have found that you can watch these discs over and over since many times you can pick up things you didn't quite catch the first time.

This set is an absolute MUST OWN for the do-it-yourselfer!

I hope the guys at ""Ask This Old House"" are reading these reviews......  Let's roll out season #2 and #3 soon.  I am ready to buy them!",1113264000,35,771,4.3426573426573425

The menus are set up PERFECTLY with options of viewing a specific episode, or going to a specific project (such as ""digging a hole for a fence"").
