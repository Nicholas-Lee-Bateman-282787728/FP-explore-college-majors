1401235,1,B000056WR6,"This is undeniably the worst stand up performance ever. Martin Lawrence is a decent actor. Big Momma's House is hilarious. But in stand up,he can't joke his way out of a paper bag. Almost every other word is a swear word. I don't mind swearing,but it can get old fast. Also,the topics discussed in this DVD are the same topics every black comedian has talked about:race,drugs,and sex. When Richard Pryor and Chris Rock do this,it can be funny. When Martin and other certain comedians do it,it is not funny. His routine on racism is the most racist routine of all time. His impression of a white man is really annoying. If you want to hear a good impression of a white man,check out Dave Chappelle's ""Killin' Them Softly.""He is hilarious. Steer clear of this and Runteldat"".",1064793600,3,773,4.6911764705882355
1401236,3,B000056WR6,"I saw this at my man's when I went home from college for the weekend, and he wouldn't let me borrow it b/c he has to show everyone who stops by this DVD.  Well, I don't blame him b/c I laughed so hard.  I haven't laughed this much through a comedy ever.  I reccomend this DVD to anyone who loves comedy b/c Martin is sooo funny!!! I just had to own it myself",1034640000,3,358,3.8767123287671232
1401237,3,B000056WR6,"I usually like Martin lawrance, and I have a good collection of his movies, but this is the first time I see him on a theater stand, Frankly he was not up to my expectations, and I guess that he is a great actor but not a good stand on theater",1028419200,,243,3.784313725490196
1401238,5,B000056WR6,"Any fan of Martin Lawrence will like this DVD.  I am a huge Martin fan and had to have this when I saw it.

There are twelve chapters to this DVD and each one of them will give you tons of laughter.

Relatively little is immune from Martin's humor.  The subjects range from relationships to childhood to Jeffery Dahmer.

For anyone who remembers his appearance on Saturday Night Live (the one he got in HUGE trouble with NBC and I believe banned from SNL and perhaps the network for) some of the material should be familiar to you.

The front of the DVD packaging uses the words ""uncut"", ""unrated"" and ""unbelievably funny"".  All are true.

If you are easily offended by profanity and comedy about sexual situations I would recommend passing up this DVD.  However, if neither of those bother you and you love laughing hysterically, ""You So Crazy"" is definitely something you should add to your DVD collection.

This material is proof why Martin Lawrence is the best!  It is just as funny now as it was in 1993 and as it will be in 2013.",992736000,16,1035,4.481283422459893
1401239,2,B000056WR6,"I bought this video and was very disappointed. I know Martin to be a great actor but simply, he does not cut it as a stand up. Most of his material used in ""You so Crazy"" is Richard Pryor material. Stuff like masturbation,drug use, differences in black and white people, acting like a kid when he gets a hot female, etc are taken from Richard Pryor Live in Concert, Live in the Sunset Strip etc...",988588800,3,397,4.306666666666667

1401320,3,B000056WR6,"I love Martin, but I think most of his best work was done on his show.  This stand up routine had great moments, but not as funny to me as his show.
There were moments of seriousness/reality in which Martin supersedes everyone else in the entertainment world......but I wanted more laughable moments from him",1401408000,,308,4.703703703703703

Especially in his younger days. As evident in this Stand up Show: You So Crazy. And his Racial humor is spot on, especially for the time that this video took place. I have never laughed so hard at some of the Subjects, from The LA Riots, Jeffery Dahmer, to his first time smoking Weed. Now these days we have to settle for... Kevin Hart. So sad. But I want to thank Martin, when I saw this on TV back then, I knew I had to buy it when it came out on DVD! A Must own!",1390867200,,629,3.9606299212598426

1401346,5,B000056WR6,"This concert movie of Martin Lawrence entitled ""You So Crazy"" is his best stage work captured on film yet. Despite being from 1994, much of it is not dated and holds up very well. There are some references to the events of the time but one can easily follow even if you are not well versed in the headlines of the early 1990s. Lawrence covers topics from infamous criminals to racism to the battles of the sexes and other absurdities in modern day life. Highlights include Lawrence ribbing on the ups and downs of fame, inmates in prison, racism and euphemisms about watching the Andy Griffith Show. It is best not to spoil any of the jokes or punchlines, so I will simply recommend this film for fans of stand-up comedy, especially for those who enjoy Lawrence's outrageous brand of humor.",1342051200,,790,4.609929078014185

1401393,3,B000056WR6,"I can remember watching the ""uncut"" rendition on an HBO special years ago and I could not believe (at the time) the opinions and stance Martin Lawrence took on various subjects of the day. You might say I was ""shocked"" not appalled but shocked that Lawrence chose to incorporate many sensitive subjects into his routine: An incredibly talented comic.

Personally, I feel Chris Rock saw this performance and borrowed aspects of Lawrence's techniques and subjects. So what! They are both great comics when they are original and averse to appealing to the morons by simplifying their routines.

I give this DVD a three star rating because some censoring idiot ""cut"" many scenes from the original HBO Cable TV special and thereby cut the integrity of the original comedic salvo Lawrence proffered.",1120780800,11,793,5.0458015267175576

I'm tellin you I couldn't stop listening to this. Fast forward a few years when [I could not afford cable] and HBO re-runs it. That made my week. I think his first performance was better than the second, runtelldat, but both are amazing. martin brings comedy with heart, passion, and with a ""you know what I'm talkin 'bout"" feel.
