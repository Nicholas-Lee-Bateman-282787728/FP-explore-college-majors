7921866,5,B00004SPYC,"The final volume of the Best of Andy Kaufman on ""Taxi"" comes from the series final season and the two-part ""Scenskees From a Marriage.""  In Part 1 (Episode #94, October 21, 1982), Latka spends the night snowbound with a woman cabbie (Allyce Beasley).  The other cabbies try to talk Latka into hiding his guilt but as soon as Simka sees her husband she yells ""You did it with another woman!""  Then in Part 2 (Episode #95, October 28, 1982), Simka has to settle the score following the Old World tradition of her people and picking a lover from among Latka's workmates.  The mind boggles just thinking about that one, huh?  These episodes are arguably the last of the really good Latka/Simka episodes.  Again, Kaufman is good as Latka but Carol Kane is just great as Simka.  Both parts of this show were written by Ian Praiser and Howard Gewirtz, who wrote most of the really good Latka/Simka episodes.",997574400,,900,4.658227848101266
