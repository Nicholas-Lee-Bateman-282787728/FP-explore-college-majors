It is a lot to pack into only 20 minutes and therefore it kept the attention of my 3 year old daughter. Her favorite part was when Mr. Jibblets was in the garden and was soaked by the sprinklers!  A great homemade product that has kept us coming back to it again and again.",1134518400,,380,4.323943661971831
8087447,5,B000BJNUJ8,Mr. Jibblets was totally hilarious!  I have a 7 yr. old and a 4 yr. old and they both loved it!  We can't wait to see Mr. Lucarelli's next video!,1133827200,,145,3.8
8087448,5,B000BJNUJ8,This is a very clever video with excellent songs for learning and singing along to.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter loved it.  Look forward to more adventures with Mr. Jibblets.,1132444800,,173,4.548387096774194

8087450,5,B000BJNUJ8,"I purchased this item for my grandchildren, ages 5 and 8 and they thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed at all the segments.  The 5 yr.old girl said her favorite was ""Blockhead"" and the laundry segment.  The 8 yr.old boy liked ""Dig It"" and so did his Grandma.  The music and pictures went with the story and were really clever.",1131494400,,323,4.440677966101695
