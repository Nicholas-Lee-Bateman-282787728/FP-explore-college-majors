8009593,5,B0001B50KI,"Murray gets down with it in this DVD. Any law enforcement and correctional officer can tell you that all confrontations don't occur on your feet. Learning ground combat is the key to saying after a challenging day at work: ""Honey, I'm home. Thankx again, Amazon.",1376956800,,262,4.844444444444444
8009594,3,B0001B50KI,"The problem with this video is Eric Murray (the cop) obviously knows very little about ground combatives so he plays training dummy to James Kodzis (not a cop, a sport BJJ practitioner).  This video seems to have been made to cash in on the popularity of grappling but does not address the police job-functional skill side of things.  For example, police employ the ""cheat to win"" principle which means in a nutshell that they employ the ""dirty"" grappling techniques to gain the advantage at all costs (for the police, losing is not an option).  For instance, during a ground confrontation a police officer may take a ball-point pen out of his pant-leg pocket and jam it into a tender part of a subject to get an appropriate pain response from a combative subject.  They are not going to teach you this type of stuff in an air-conditioned dojo where everyone is wearing white pyjamas and practicing on clean grappling mats.  That said, sadly some police officers are no better prepared for a ground confrontation than your average citizen - for such officers this video will at least highlight the need to become conversant in basic ground fighting skills.  For all you law enforcement types, remember to train as you fight.",1266796800,,1224,4.804761904761905

8009596,2,B0001B50KI,"In this film, Eric Murray and James Kodzis present some MMA/BJJ ground fighting techniques. The reason why this film is called Police ground combat is beyond me, however.

At the beginning on the film, Murray and kodzis tell the viewer that almost all of the hand to hand encounters the police encounter, end up in the ground because the handcuffs are the easiest to apply on the ground. That is true, but for some reason they end up presenting a collection of MMA/BJJ techniques, with no emphasis on how to apply handcuffs to the subject. Instead, you are instructed to get a submission hold to the subject, making him tap out... I have been a police officer for over ten years, and I don't remember a single incident where the subject had tapped out, instead I have had to wrestle myself to a position where I could apply the handcuffs. In addition to the fact you are not taught to apply the techniques on the street, they are taught wearing only light clothing. It would have been interesting to see how easy it would be to use these techniques wearing full duty gear.

So, the techniques presented in the film are not realistic for police officers but can you utilize them in the ring? Of course you can, but they are not taught with enough detail; on some occasions there is hardly any instruction at all. I guess you are supposed to catch the nuances of the technique by just watching the film.

The film is not entirely bad, however, as they teach some neat techniques in the film. In addition to that, the production is of the usual good Turtle Press standard.

8009598,5,B0001B50KI,The format used in this training DVD is easy to understand and the information and techniques are very practical. Kim does an excellent job in putting his law enforecement series together and Police Ground Combat is a must for those who want to learn the fundamentals of ground combat without all the martial arts hype. Too often agencies won't train their personnel and the Law Enforcement Series by Kim is a great resource for them. Excellent job!,1103155200,,449,4.8441558441558445
8009599,5,B0001B50KI,"This instructive DVD was very informative.  A great introduction if you don't know nothing about ground fighting, but feel confused by more complex ground fighting material.  I truly recommend this to anyone.",1102550400,2,208,5.46875
