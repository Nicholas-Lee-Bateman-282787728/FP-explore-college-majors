I gave it a four star verses a five for the simple fact none of the ""extras"" are one it. The movie will loop until it is stopped. No main menu - nothing. However, it is nice to have a copy of this movie back in my collection for my child to watch.",1375747200,,378,3.7974683544303796

8052400,4,B0007VY4PO,"Also known as The Hunchedback Horse (Konyok-gorbunok), this is the first full-length animated movie from the Soviet Union. In 1977 it was remade as The Magic Pony with Hans Conreid.

It follows a tale of Ivannushko and his discovery of magical horses, one small one with humps like a Bactrian camel. Some of his many labors include capturing the luminous lantern birds, learning magic and meeting a lovely enchanted maiden whom rides the waves like a boat. But the king and chancellor are quite sly and unpredictable. The king wants the maiden for himself, but she does not love him. She wants Ivannushko. Ivan must be put to the test or die trying.",1280361600,,649,4.743362831858407
