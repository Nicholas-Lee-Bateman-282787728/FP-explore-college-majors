7805169,5,6300213633,"If you are going to watch an episode dealing with children, make it this one.  By exposing the ""beautiful"" angel, Kirk shows how easy it is for sinister people to exploit innocent minds.  This episode successfully demonstrated how weak evil leaders are without followers.  Like Spock said, ""Without followers, evil cannot spread"".  Not bad for an episode dealing with children.  Season Three is kicking butt!  Shame on you who bash the Third Season!",1242259200,,449,5.082191780821918
7805170,5,6300213633,"Possibly the most intelligent and daring episode (no babes, no explosions) of all three seasons. It is quintessential Star Trek; searing social commentary disguised as `entertainment', which still ""goes over the head"" of most viewers, even today. Written by Edward Lakso (whose credits include Mission Impossible, Wild Wild West, Rockford Files, Barnaby Jones, Air Wolf), the plot describes the rise and fall of the Nazi Youth movement, where impressionable teens were encouraged to denounce their parents, swear allegiance to a charismatic govt official and propel his rise to power. Apparently Lakso had been observing China... because when this episode aired in 1968, Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution was two years old, unleashing the identical, devastating, social anarchy. It was if an ""angel of evil"" (named `Chaos' in this episode) had hibernated after WWII, only to re-appear and initiate the same cycle of destruction, in a different country. In true Biblical, Greek, or Star Wars mythological style, Kirk is forced to confront and subdue his own ""beast within"" before tackling the external enemy, and exposing the `beautiful' angel for what he is; ugly naked Greed, exploiting innocent minds with the complicity of the ""silent majority"". If this episode makes you uncomfortable, don't blame it on the primitive production values; look inside yourself and think.",1021334400,3,1373,5.481132075471698
7805171,1,6300213633,"When the U.S.S. Enterprise finds that all the adults in the Starnes expedition to Triacus have killed themselves, they beam to the planet's surface to investigate. The children, however, are alive and well and  strangely oblivious to their parents' fates.  They are beamed aboard the  U.S.S. Enterprise while Kirk searches for an answer to the strange  occurrences. The children summon their ""friendly angel"" Gorgan,  who tells them to take the U.S.S. Enterprise to a planet he can control. By  garbling Kirk's words and deceiving Spock, the children are able to take  control of the starship. Finally, seeing Kirk's anxiety at the loss of his  ship, Spock realizes that something is wrong and helps the Captain regain  control.  Kirk shows the children tricorder tapes of their parents... and  their graves, demonstrating to them that Gorgan is not a ""friendly  angel"" but an evil force. The loss of his believers renders Gorgan  impotent and he fades into oblivion.",943315200,3,967,5.121794871794871
7805172,1,6300213633,This episode is only one of a handful of truly awful original Trek shows. There is nothing redeeming in the entire plotline and one watches it through gritted teeth.,918172800,3,165,4.724137931034483
