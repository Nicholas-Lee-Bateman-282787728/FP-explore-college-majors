I searched through the Sesame Street videos to find one in which Oscar was the primary character (my son also really likes Telly monster)- and this one features  both.  The ""movies"" that are reviewed by Oscar and Telly are not  some of 'Sesame Street's' greatest, but on the whole, it's a cute video,  and good for some laughs from the little people.",930614400,12,403,4.465753424657534
2887,4,0738921467,"I never saw this special during my childhood, which in retrospect was really too bad. Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding ""pre-Elmo"" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful ""trash"" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky.
Admittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the ""demon"" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word ""demon"" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a ""little red demon!"" (Just Kidding).
As with nearly everyone else who reviewed this special, I really wish that it was available on DVD. However, if I must purchase a used VHS copy, I will do so.",1332547200,,1708,4.60327868852459

She is frightened by the wizard and cried when Sahu goes to his parents; she didn't understand why he went away, but would just come get us to sit with her for that part. She is still requesting it a year later. I have memorized the songs. As with so many others brought to you by Sesame Street it is treasure for all ages.",1231718400,2,596,4.2368421052631575

  Oddly enough, I really believe that this movie was a large contributing factor to my choice of archaeology as a career. This movie is a classic. It encourages real world participation and is still able to make me laugh. As soon as I have children, this will be the first video that they ever watch.",1194048000,,548,4.405940594059406
2895,5,0738921467,"I first saw this film back in 1983. I must have been about seven. I remember when it first premiered on PBS (Channel 11 in Chicago, where I grew up). My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.

It's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing! It becomes a game of cat and mouse as the night guard is sure that something weird is going on and the gang just slips by him. But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle. Big Bird and Snuffy come to the rescue to come up with the answer.

There are also some cute little songs in here, like ""Mothers and Children,"" sung by Olivia, ""Don't eat the Pictures,"" done by Cookie Monster and the Girls, and ""You'll get Home Soon,"" by Big Bird and Sahou. I liked this video and I plan to share it with my own children someday because it opens up the world of art appreciation to them. Very well done. And no Elmo!",1181433600,,1499,4.077966101694916

It turned out to be three nondescript, uninteresting DVDs in a box that was not like the box I saw in the store.  I returned it, but they charged me shipping and handling, and I was out the time and effort.  The return process gave no way to explain the problem.

2898,5,0738921467,"As a kid, I used to watch Sesame Street, a show that was by then a classic. My parents bought this film from the library and my sister and I watched it constantly. My dad still remembers songs from the film and my sister and I reminisce about it.

The plot of the story is that the kids and the puppets get locked into a museum overnight. They get to tour the area without being bothered by others. Oscar the Grouch sings a song about wonderful trash, referring to the broken statues all around him. Cookie Monster sings the title song when he gets hungry from looking at still life paintings all night. Big Bird and Snuffy find an Egyptian Prince and attempt to help him become a star in the sky like his parents. Everything that happens is entertaining and educational.

Not only does this film address a side of schooling that isn't always addressed in schools, art, it is a great way for parents to spend time with their children and help them to grow.",1150848000,5,956,4.395480225988701
2899,1,0738921467,"1 star is too high for this.  It should be rated ""Stay away, it's horrible"". This movie is the epitome of false advertising.  The name is misleading and the video is misleading.  It's not really about the MET at all.  There are token amounts of the museum in it, but it's primarily about showing kids evil, demons, and how to become a star in the night sky.

Personally I was trying to find some of those classic comedy routines I remember from when I was a kid, like Ernie calling to the fish (Here fishy fishy fishy).

It is calming and sweet but also entertaining.  It works too...it always calms them down and puts the baby to sleep.  Our oldest, now nine, still enjoys watching it, and the two younger ones (1 and 4) share a room and both really enjoy it.  The songs are nice and the skits are fun but calming.  My favorite part is the moon and sky story, but I also like the rest of the video as well.

We are fortunate in Australia the show is aired weekdays, the only down side is we only have a few of the dvd's available to purchase. So I didn't hestitate in purchasing them from ""AMAZON"".

2913,5,0738921467,"Sesame Street specials are always wonderful, but this hour long movie, filmed when Sesame Street was in its prime, is just spectacular.  It remains one of my favorite ways to cheer myself up (I'm 27).  When Big Bird wanders off near closing time to meet Snuffleupagus, and the rest of the Sesame Street monsters and humans try frantically to find him, they all get locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  The rest of the video, which amounts to the bulk of the story, revolves around three main storylines:  1.)  everyone trying to find Big Bird while avoiding the suspicious but clueless mustachio-ed museum security guard, 2.)  everyone discovering and enjoying the museum in the process, and 3.) Big Bird and Snuffleupagus helping a little Egyptian boy named Sahu prove his inner worth in a yearly ""test"", so that the god Osiris will let him join his parents as stars in the sky.  There is enough of a storyline to ensnare even those with the shortest of attention spans, children and adults alike, and quite a bit of comic relief to lighten the way.  Watching straight-arrow Bob as he runs around trying to keep Cookie Monster from scarfing down the Still Lives, while a group of dancing Monster-ettes sings the doo-wop title tune: ""Don't eat the pictures, no, no, no!"", is particularly amusing;  as are the scenes where Sahu's invisible cat, who still meows audibly, befuddles that poor hapless security guard.  The many many shots of the Museum interior are gorgeous, and a magical exposure/introduction to art and museums, in particular the paintings, sculpture, and medieval artifacts of the Met.  The video of course has a happy ending, but one that will bring tears to your eyes.  I watched this tape for the first time when I was 7 years old, and I must say that when as an adult I had my first opportunity to go to the Met in person, it was a truly awesome visit.  Another friend who had watched the movie as a child led me on what we called the Don't Eat the Pictures Tour, and she showed me every piece of art showcased in the movie.  Her tour ended at the Temple of Dendur itself, and as it was near closing time, it was dark outside with stars in the sky--just like the penultimate scene of DETP.  A memorable day, and a memorable movie.  It's a true gift from the Sesame Street gang to us, the viewing public.  You and your kids will love it.",1046822400,40,2372,4.5829383886255926
2914,5,0738921467,"(Althought the titles differ, I believe this is the same as Sleepy Time Songs and Stories.)
We watch this about once a week (too often and we all get bored, no?) and every time it calms my 2 year-old who then goes to sleep quickly and soundly.  The songs are lovely and there is a delightful story about how the sun and the moon came to live in the sky which is narrated by Ozzie Davis.  The last song is a drift-y, dreamy sequence with balloons - a nice ending.
This does not have the usual frenetic Sesame Street pace/quality but is rather sweet and very relaxing.  Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, Big Bird, etc.  (no Elmo).  Excellent!
We mix this goodnight video up with Kipper, Little People, Goodnight Moon and Maisy.  Sweet dreams!",1044144000,,735,4.488721804511278

They are now 20 months old and are beginning to say the words of the alphabet song along with Big Bird and Baby Bear.  I think that this video and some of our other Sesame Street videos (like The Alphabet Jungle Game) have helped them begin to recognize and be able to say the letters sooner.  They are particularly fascinated with Baby Bear.  I would highly recommend this one!,1008720000,2,498,4.43956043956044

Hopefully he's learning the alphabet!,1005091200,,312,4.081967213114754
2920,4,0738921467,"The best way to help your child learn the alphabet or numbers is to work with them one on one with books and letter shapes.  However, these videos are a fun way to reinforce what you're teaching them.
My two-year-old son will easily watch one of these videos all the way through, dancing and ""singing"" along.  He can almost make it through both of them back to back, which is quite high praise for a video from a toddler!
I must admit that Baby Bear has never been one of my favorite Sesame Street characters.  He *seems* older than a little baby, and his ""mispwonunciations"" a la Elmer Fudd grate on my ears.  But he is the character who is being taught the alphabet in ""A,B,C"", not the one doing the teaching, so he doesn't bother me as much.  He goes to Big Bird for help learning the alphabet.  Big Bird is the teacher who uses various cartoon clips and live action bits to illustrate the entire alphabet and most of the letters individually.  Please note I say ""most""--Baby Bear already knows A, B, and C, for instance, so although they are mentioned in passing they are not featured.  Also, a lot of verbs are used for illustration (J is for Jiggling, Jumping, and Jogging, for instance).  Because children usually learn nouns before verbs this makes some letters a bit less meaningful than others.  But don't get me wrong--there is plenty of singing and dancing and the entire alphabet is repeated multiple times.  My son loves to hear the Sesame Street gang sing the ABCs!
""1,2,3"" is the video that inspired me to buy this tape.  My son saw it at a friend's house and was captivated.  In this case, each number between one and twenty is featured in at least a small sketch or song.  The plot focuses on Ernie who finds a hotel room key and then proceeds to teach the managers how counting can help them do their jobs.  It, too, is great fun.
In short, buy the video for your preschooler, but don't rely on it alone to team him or her the alphabet or numbers.",1005004800,3,1966,4.4222222222222225

Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift, but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl, and keep hoping that it will be released.
One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age, you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.
