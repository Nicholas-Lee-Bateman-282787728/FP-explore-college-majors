I have done the workout fathfully and have lost 5 pounds in 3 weeks.",1385424000,2,109,3.782608695652174
2788176,3,B000NX2I72,My wife wanted this to replace her original one that she loaned to a friend and never got back. This one arrived on time but she says it's got quite a few scratches on it. It still seems to work but I'm making a fresh copy just in case this one decides to give up on her.,1371427200,2,271,3.7719298245614037
2788177,4,B000NX2I72,I like that they provided alternative moves to some of the harder exercises. The instructions were good and easy to follow.,1370131200,4,123,4.904761904761905
2788178,4,B000NX2I72,"This is a great workout.  Brings up your cardio, makes you sweat AND helps with weight loss.  I really like this work out and do it twice a week.",1305158400,3,145,3.9655172413793105
2788179,5,B000NX2I72,"Who would have thought such tiny little movements could be so effective?  All that is needed for this program is a chair and a towel to wipe the sweat!  Anyone can do this workout but in the beginning they will have to cut down on the number of repetitions.  There are 2 workouts on this DVD.  The Basic Workout is a combination of standing and floor exercises. The Golden Workout is done completely in a chair. The focus on tiny precise movements reminds me of Beginning Callanetics but this program adds additional movements, music, and Chico's exuberant personality.  Chico has 4 diverse female students exercising along with him and the DVD includes their testimonials.  They run the gamut from someone who has only been on the program for 2 weeks to a new mother to a lady with osteoporosis.  The DVD production quality is a little dated and you can barely hear the music but Chico's cueing is excellent. Thank goodness he counts you through these deceptively challenging movements.  I bought this DVD used and I hope he reissues an updated version but doesn't change the exercises!  Highly recommended!",1274400000,9,1108,4.8201058201058204

8182260,5,B000NX2I72,"This is, I think, one of the best workout programs out there, he has you use your own body as strength. So the only equimpment you need is a chair. It's very difficult at first (you want to give up cos it hurts SO MUCH) but you see results very quickly. it's not a dance dance party and you only need a small living room area to complete the excersices. As long as you can lay down flat in the area and put your arms out at full length, you've got the space. you aren't jumping around so if you live with neighbors under you, they won't get annoyed either.
I LOVE CHICO",1397520000,2,569,4.04424778761062
8182261,5,B000NX2I72,Wonderful low impact program. You can pause it and rest whenever you need to. And Chico is funny - I really like this program and it is very effective.,1394496000,2,151,4.241379310344827
