8315160,3,B001KKU9BE,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released. And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events. These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

Armageddon 2003
This was a RAW PPV & one of those events that looked real good on paper but it came off like watching a 3 hour edition of RAW due to most of the matches never seeming to pick up the pace past ""first gear"" or just some wrestlers having an off night.  The main story told throughout the night was the establishment of Evolution being the top dominate faction on RAW. The main event was the triple threat for the World Title with Goldberg vs. Triple H vs. Kane, Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Randy Orton with Mick Foley as the referee, Booker T vs. Mark Henry, Shawn Michaels vs. Batista, Trish Stratus & Lita vs. Chris Jericho & Christian, Womens Champion Molly Holly vs. Ivory, and a tag team turmoil match for the World Tag Team Titles.  In the end, this was more of a PPV to establish the upcoming feuds & storylines leading into the Royal Rumble & WrestleMania more than anything else.  I remember that this DVD is loaded with extras as they have bonus interviews along with footage of The Rock's return to RAW earlier in the week and Stacy Keibler doing the ""LEGS-a-rooney"" with Booker T.

Royal Rumble 2004
The Chris Benoit Show would be the proper title for this Rumble as Benoit did what HBK did in '95 by starting #1 & winning the Rumble at the end with a hard-fought finish with Big Show. WrestleMania XX was right around the corner so this Rumble setup alot of the storylines going into the Rumble such as Mick Foley's return at the expense of Randy Orton, the first signs of the Undertaker returning to his ""deadman"" character, and the interaction between Brock Lesnar & Goldberg. The other standout match on here was the awesome Last Man Standing match with Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H.  Other matches include Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero, WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Hardcore Holly, Crusierweight Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble, and a tables match between World Tag Team Champions Batista & Ric Flair vs. Dudley Boyz.

In the end, Armageddon certainly wasn't the worst PPV of the year but it wasn't one of the best either as it was an event that you weren't really missing anything if you didn't see it.  However, the Royal Rumble event itself was solid from top to bottom with the Last Man Standing, the Rumble match itself, and to a lower extent...the tables match being the highlights so you can't go wrong here with this set if you have a few extra bucks.

The only match available on another DVD is the Eddie vs. Chavo match which is on Eddie Guerrero's ""Viva La Raza"" DVD",1233878400,,2920,4.546666666666667
8315161,3,B001KKU9BE,"Coming soon from the WWE is a Tagged Classics of two PPVs: the Dec. 2003 RAW-only ARMAGEDDON, and the annual January event ROYAL RUMBLE 2004.

There seem to be a few common themes with these double-DVD sets:
*  A few good matches
*  A lot to criticize
*  Little reason to buy, especially if you already own either of the PPVs.

Nevertheless, I'll try to be helpful to those who're curious:

*****ARMAGEDDON 2003*****
---This was RAW's 3rd brand-only event, and it mostly receives lukewarm reviews.  In my opinion, it's nothing special.  However, I think a lot of people forgot that this PPV was meant to be a throwback to the Four Horsemen's dominance from the NWA's heyday.  Evolution was an incredible faction that I wish was still around.  But more importantly, there are a couple of decent matches on the card.  The best contest is easily Shawn Michaels versus Batista; ""The Animal"" hadn't had a better match in his young career.  On the other end of the spectrum, the IC Title Match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam (the champion) is a ""love-it-or-hate-it"" affair.  I've read just as many positive comments as I have negative ones.  Orton's slower-paced offense could really test you if he was cocky enough, and on this night, he was pretty full of himself.  The main event between Kane, Triple H, and Goldberg (the World Heavyweight champion) entertained me.  It's nothing special, but it gets the job done.

I guess that last sentence summarizes ARMAGEDDON 2003.  In the end, a chapter in Evolution's story has been told, but it was a long three hours to endure.

*****ROYAL RUMBLE 2004*****
---I'll start with the 30-Man Royal Rumble.  While everyone's got their own favorites and criteria for enjoying these battle royals, I consider this to be one of the top five.  I may be naive, but I still get goosebumps watching the last few participants in this match.  It could've gone in so many directions.  In addition to that little factoid, I love how the match keeps going, with wrestlers doing more than just punching, kicking, and hoisting.
The rest of the card leaves much to be desired.  The opening Table Match is a monumental disappointment, especially because it was for the World Tag Team Titles.  The Cruiserweight Title Match between Jamie Noble & Rey Mysterio is also underwhelming.  There's no reason these two couldn't have stolen the show; I've seen them do it on SMACKDOWN TV for free!  The Eddie/Chavo grudge match is still a strange one to me.  Every time I watch it, I'd never have guessed that ""Latino Heat"" would win the WWE Championship just one month later.  There've been better champion pushes, that's for sure.
Once you get over the initial shock of seeing Hardcore Holly in a WWE Championship Match, the match never takes off.  It's way too short for anything significant to happen.  Say what you will about Brock Lesnar's WWE legacy, but he was skilled enough to deserve better than this.
I actually really enjoy the Last Man Standing Match between Shawn Michaels and Triple (the World Heavyweight champion).  I don't mind the draw finish, either.  The two opponents delivered a very competitive display, and are always a pleasure to watch.

The 2004 ROYAL RUMBLE PPV redeems itself in the end, if you can stomach the first hour.
_____________________________________________

ARMAGEDDON 2003 isn't worth buying, even with the neat Evolution/Horsemen parallels.  The 2004 ROYAL RUMBLE isn't a very good PPV overall, but its last two matches (clocking in at about 100 minutes combined) are well worth your time.  I recommend you buy the second PPV, and ignore this boxed set.",1229299200,,3657,4.936065573770492
