803601,5,6304172761,"I always thought of Marilyn Monroe as simply a sex object.  I didn't really think too much about her as a person.  When I saw ""Norma Jean and Marilyn"", and the portrayal of the two people that made up  Marilyn, I changed my mind. This movie was heartbreaking.  We see her as a  child with a mentally impaired mother.  She had no stability in her early  life.  I cried for the little Norma Jean.  In her adult life, all she  wanted was to be loved.  She searched everywhere for someone who would love  her for herself. She wanted to be a mother more than anything, even though  motherhood is not something you would usually associate with Marilyn  Monroe.  I think that if she hadn't miscarried, her life might have turned  out much differently.  This movie does a wonderful job portraying Marilyn  in a sympathetic light.  We see the stronger Norma Jean pushing and  prodding the much more insecure Marilyn.  It broke my heart to see her  descend into utter despair and hopelessness. She may have been one of the  most beautiful and popular women in the world, but she was also the  lonliest. The writing and acting were superb.  I recommend this to anyone  who is a Marilyn fan, or anyone interested in Hollywood.",945734400,11,1214,4.55607476635514

803706,3,6304172761,"...I don't like the way the film is structured.  I mean, the storytelling.  Yes, Marilyn Monroe was a real woman and so was Norma Jean, but the facts seem either made up for film or chopped up.  The Secret Life Of Marilyn Monroe, in my opinion, was a better film, storytelling-wise.  As far as the stars go, Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino are probably the only good things about it.  They're both hot and courageous women who while playing their respective parts don't seem to mind to show the cameras how stacked they really are.  Their hot bods are ready for anything and so are they.  I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to show up in Playboy if they hadn't already!",1439942400,,671,4.450819672131147

803713,1,6304172761,"I have watched this film and while I enjoy Judd and Sorvino in other movies, this was not one of them.  Marilyn was troubled, but she was not at all of what was portrayed in the movie.  She had her share of men, don't get me wrong, but if anything, she can very well hold her own.  She was a very intelligent woman, can sing a beautiful note, and was sexy when she did not try or did not know she was sexy.  Mental illnesses are not sins, but the producers and writers made it look it.

I have studied and loved Marilyn for many years, so any new actress cannot hold a candle when they're selected to portray Marilyn.",1400716800,,617,4.108333333333333
803714,3,6304172761,I thought some of the plot had holes. Marilyn left the set of the Misfits with her husband Arhur Miller. In the next scene she was doing drugs with Montgomery Clifton complaining that Arhur Miller left her.  It is not explained how she met Montgomery Clifton if she never came on to the set of The Misfits or the circumstances of Arthur Miller leaving her.,1396742400,,356,4.476923076923077
803715,4,6304172761,"I love MM and have a decent collection of her movies and books . I'd been wanting to see this show for the longest time and I kept searching for this title on Netflix with no success. FINALLY found it on Amazon!! I very much enjoyed Norma Jean and Marilyn except for one tiny, little annoying thing...Mira Sorvino was totally wrong for the part of Marilyn. Just wrong!! Ashley Judd, who plays the unknown Norma Jean, MADE me BELIEVE in her role. Judd's performance was excellent and I fell in love with her version of Norma Jean. The way Judd played NJ is pretty much the way I envisioned her in the early portions of MM's life. There isn't anything new to learn in this film about the life of Marilyn Monroe but it was exciting (and painful) to watch it all play out in front of me. I was totally enthralled with the first half of this movie and couldn't wait for Norma Jean to become Marilyn. I was anxious to see how Sorvino would bring her version of Marilyn to life. Cut to scene where Norma Jean is about to be transformed into the world's sexiest woman with the famous moniker. When I first see Sorvino as MM, my immediate reaction is NO!! How could they have cast her with such horrible hair? The real MM would have NEVER come out of her dressing room with hair like THAT!! And the teeth? When Sorvino smiled, what was supposed to be Marilyn's famous, sexy smile, it was ALL WRONG!! The only thing Sorvino may have gotten a tiny bit right was the Marilyn walk. To be fair, only Marilyn could do that famous signature wiggly-walk, and the signature smile, with the signature style. It was a persona that Norma Jean created and could turn off and on whenever she wanted. Now then, so I am clear and do not dissuade anyone from watching/purchasing this movie, even with the so-so portrayal of MM, this is still a must-see for fans of Marilyn. In my opinion, this was a pretty decent flick and I eventually accepted Sorvino's role. Afterall, I did give it 4 stars for something. Enjoy.",1396483200,2,1989,4.422343324250681
803763,5,6304172761,"Oh, Marilyn...an icon if ever there was one.  This is one of those movies that people either love or hate.  I happen to love it.  Ashley Judd delivers a riveting portrayal of Norma Jeane Baker, the fiery brunette vixen driven to overcome her traumatic childhood and succeed on the silver screen.  Judd is at the prime of her beauty in this film and her resemblance to young Norma Jeane is uncanny at times.  She is simply gorgeous and her acting was superb...viewers can gain some insight into Norma Jeane's ambition, her desire to rise to the top and finally be ""somebody"".  Some people have criticized how Marilyn is portrayed in this film but one must realize that Hollywood can be a brutal place and it took a lot to achieve the success that she did. They must also understand that while much of the film is accurate, some of it was also taken from a book by Ted Jordan, who claimed that he was Monroe's lover in the 1940's.  Some of his claims about her are dubious (read the book to know what I'm talking about) but some of it rings true.

I love that they stayed true to some things about Marilyn...when she first went blonde in 1946, being sent to the orphanage as a child, and a few other things.  I also found my eyes welling up with tears at the scene where she takes on her new identity as Marilyn Monroe...something about that scene is just so powerfully haunting in ways I can't explain.  Anyone who has ever struggled with depression, low self-esteem, abuse, rejection, or abandonment will see themselves in this particular scene.  Mira Sorvino is now Marilyn and although she does a wonderful job, her appearance is the only issue for me.  I find her more believable as Marilyn than I do with Michelle Williams (""My Week with Marilyn"") but still...she is a bit too tall and although definitely a pretty girl, something is missing.  But I guess no one can really do Marilyn justice...those are big shoes to fill.  And the final scene is obviously dramatized because Marilyn did not die that way.

I've been a fan of Marilyn since the age of 13 and I have nearly every book written about her.  A bit obsessive, maybe, but she is the quintessential icon to me...her story is tragic but it is also about dreams and determination and in a sense, rebirth.  Monroe underwent a transformation and to this day she endures.  She died at 36 but her magic remains.  I love that this movie captures both sides of who she was...not only a blonde bombshell but a complex individual tormented by inner demons.  No matter how she tried, she couldn't escape the ghosts of her past.  Marilyn is a lot like Dorothy Dandridge, another famous woman of that era who died under mysterious circumstances in 1965.  Both of them possessing talent and beauty, yet enduring hardships (sexism and mental illness for Monroe, sexism/racism in the case of Dandridge).
Not only does this film show the Marilyn most people are familiar with, all blonde hair and red lips and tight dresses...it shows the lesser-known Norma Jeane, the sad little girl with big dreams and the desire to leave her painful past behind.  Some people feel that this is an unflattering portrait of Marilyn's character and who she was, but it might actually be very close to the truth.  She suffered from bipolar disorder and numerous physical ailments and she was haunted by a deep insecurity that caused her to work at being close to perfect.  Judd and Sorvino are actually showing two sides of her, which calls to mind Elton John's line ""goodbye Norma Jeane"" in his song ""Candle in the Wind"".  The cost of fame meant that Marilyn had to say goodbye to Norma Jeane, her former self, because Norma Jeane was a reminder of being unwanted and feeling unloved.

All in all, definitely worth watching.  I just wish I could find another great movie about Marilyn on DVD...I believe it was called ""The Untold Story"" and it stars Catherine Hicks as Marilyn.",1396051200,7,3907,4.631349782293179

803766,3,6304172761,"I bought the soundtrack for this movie before I saw the movie itself. I reasoned that with music so deep, nuanced, sophisticated, and emotionally intelligent that the movie would be so as well.

The premise of the movie is that as the real Marilyn, her birth name Norma Jean, hated the fictional character, the creation of Marilyn Monroe, sex goddess, and what ""Marilyn"" did to rise to the top. The problem with the premise is that in the beginning of the movie Norma Jean (Marilyn before she became Marilyn) is shown to be completely ruthless, greatly ambitious, amoral and even a bit vicious. In other words, the creation of ""Marilyn"" would seem to be exactly what she wanted and that she would have no guilt whatsoever about ""sleeping her way to the top.""

The movie has some depictions of Norma Jean's being sexually abused and taken advantage of as a child. It is a really dark movie at times despite the glossy look on the cover. It is a portrait of a seriously disturbed, wounded, and out of balance woman.

I think that Ashley Judd was more believable as Norma Jean than Mia Sorvino as Marilyn, but playing Marilyn is rather challenging.

Overall the movie did show Marilyn to be no one worth idolizing, but I found it too dark, too contradictory (as mentioned above), and having too much nudity, thus coming across as a pseudo-psychological skin-flick.",1392854400,4,1361,4.729957805907173

It was poorly researched the facts wern't straight and they over exaggerated her sex life and made her out to be a codependent woman who would sell out to any man that was ""someone"". I mean come on, I know she was a sex symbol of her time and wanted attention, but they took it to far. Another thing that really bothered me, was how they made it seem like she was a crazy loon, a huge junkie and a stupid person! She was not any of those things. Anyone who has ever read a book or interviews with her, would know that. So I'm telling you now, if you want to ""know"" about Marilyn Monroe, your better off buying a bio about her. The only good thing about this movie, is that Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino are really good actresses.",1173744000,5,861,4.070588235294117
803852,4,6304172761,"There are some insightful reviews here already. This movie is thoughtful and, interestingly, attempts to show us the perspectives of Norma Jean and Marilyn in the same scenes at the same time.

It's not a terribly detailed account of her life but it gives us quite enough to realise what a terrible psychological struggle it must have been to become and sustain Marilyn Monroe. One reviewer here has spoken about the inner rage Marilyn must have carried with her. I think that's right and we see it in this movie.

I thought Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino were both excellent. Ashley gets to play it more or less straight; Mira has the harder more complex job and I think she pulls it off really well.

The movie doesn't show us that much of the charming Marilyn that the world fell in love with but that's difficult because Monroe was truly exceptional and no biopic so far has captured her astonishing presence. This movie trys to show us what was behind that presence. I appreciated this try at glimpsing her inner life. But I can also see why some would be offended at, what is at times, a one dimensional portrayal of Marilyn as stupid and then a seriously disturbed, alcoholic junkie (I was irritated too). The movie assumes the viewer already knows a lot and can fill in the gaps and find a balance for themselves. There's enough information out there after all. Overall I liked this movie.",1171756800,7,1395,4.616935483870968
803867,3,6304172761,"Perhaps Norma Jean and Marilyn  was intended to be a showpiece, a

major calling card,  attraction or publicity stunt by HBO, which was

impossible to access outside USA's cable companies, for a long

time.

Perhaps it was intended to be a statement, by the leading

actress, the obviously talented Ashley Judd, in terms of

achievement and sex appeal.

Or maybe it was a failed attempt, in recreating Marilyn Monroe's

life, with a small budget movie made for cable TV.

Whatever it was, the story is one of the most perplexing ones in

recent times, mainly by the juxtaposition of Mira Sorvino and

Judd, throughout the second half of the feature, while both

playing the same Monroe, perhaps suggesting an internal struggle

in the mind of the 50's legend, between her real, simple self,

and the ""bombshell chick"" exposed in the public eye, and mass

media, that she also needs to pretend to be, to maintain her

status.

In terms of the Judd, as with almost every one of her movies, she

bravely does either the nude or semi-nude 15 second shot that's

almost comically come to characterize almost each of her movies,

over the past 10 years vs. her original refusal in Kuffs, with

Christian Slater, to do so, paradoxically.

The action unfolds, unconvincingly, in terms of action, dialog,

story-telling or explaining why certain things are seen and said,

although the actors, and sets clearly demonstrate the 50's and

60's era, and the classy restaurants, venues, hotels that Monroe

learned to inhabit and expect in her lifestyle.

Unfortunately for Sorvino, I believe her efforts were too timid

to be effective, as she fails to express sufficient confidence in

her speech and how she carries herself for the viewer to believe

she was Monroe, while Ashley Judd, is the complete opposite,

handling all aspects extremely well, yet ...as said, this movie

suggests Monroe was perhaps a schizophrenic by having 2 actresses

playing the same Monroe in the same scenes, inexplicably.

All in all, a slow Sunday afternoon movie, from which the viewer

will chuckle a few times, but mostly, fast forward from extreme

boredom. But for Ashley fans, obviously, is a must see.",1166486400,5,2180,4.919889502762431

According to this movie she only made three movies was high all of the time, was always horny and was illiterate.

In the movie they even said ""I will get to the top even if i have to sleep with every man in hollywood""

But really you have to think about it though, they do this to every great artist. so I suppose that's why they did it here. They did it to Michael Jackson in man in the mirror, and Mozart and Beethoven they make it seem like they have no talent and accendently became pop culture figures.

Although I love Ashley Judd and think she does a terrific job conveying Norma Jean's hunger and drive to make herself a star, Mira actually has the harder role, trying to make the cliche we all know as ""Marilyn"" into a flesh in blood person - watch the way she takes drugs and then ""turns on"" the Marilyn charm - and how about the bitter/funny monologue in the mirror where she calls her pills her ""best friends"" that sometimes scream ""Get out of bed, b*tch!""

I like how the film re-created moments in Marilyn's career (calendar nude shoot, white-dress blowning over grate) - like many stars (Madonna, Michael Jackson), you get the idea Marilyn doesn't really ""live"" unless she's on camera or in front of the paparrazzi - This movie always plays late at night on HBO and every time it comes on, I am compelled to drop everything and watch it again! It's THAT GOOD!  Give both Ashley and Mira a chance, this should have won some Emmys!",1097193600,59,1373,4.614754098360656

803966,3,6304172761,"Mira doesn't look anything like Marylin Monroe and it's very important in a film for an actress to look the part.  And although Mira Sorvino can generally act in other movies, her performance in this film wasn't very good. Her voice is irritating. I think Ashley Judd's and Mira Sorvino's role should have been reversed. How did the casting directors make such mistake? Mira sorvino just doesn't look like a sex symbol.",1088553600,7,419,4.819444444444445
803967,5,6304172761,"This movie is a great portrayal of Marilyn Monroe's life. When I watched it on HBO in '96, it made me more interested in her life. I wound up starting a collection of Marilyn's movies. She was bipolar (which has been declared a fact recently), and this movie is interesting as well as fact-based (although no movie is completely factual). I LOVE IT! Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd absolutely shine! They are awesome actresses!",1079481600,2,424,4.743243243243243

The ending wasn't even correct..She died in bed,not in the ambulance...None if it made sense...They made Marilyn look absolutely stupid and dumb....She was more then that....",1069200000,3,266,5.209302325581396
803969,3,6304172761,"This video, which details the latter part of Marilyn Monroe's life, is played out by two actresses, the beautiful Ashley Judd, who portrays Norma Jean Baker, and the not-so-convincing Mira Sorvino, who portrays Norma in her later years as Marilyn Monroe. Judd does a good job of acting out Norma Jean's part, and she kind of even looks like Norma. Sorvino, on the other hand, makes it hard to visualize Marilyn. Her poor acting and too-breathy voice just doesn't convince me.
As for the plot, it details the point in Norma Jean's life where she longs to be a star, and so begins her journey of sleeping her way to the top. Along with flashbacks of her childhood, and dangerous mixes of pills and alcohol, Norma slowly transforms herself into the fabulous Marilyn Monroe. We see her marriages to various men, which don't last, her depression, and her  delusions. Her past, Norma Jean, constantly follows her, giving unwanted advice, and eventually driving Marilyn mad.
All in all, I was pretty disappointed, and finished watching with a sort of sadness in my heart, not wanting to believe that what I just saw was Marilyn's life.",1049673600,3,1128,4.814432989690721
803970,1,6304172761,I believe that when a company such as HBO gets their hands on a true story that the story itself becomes a entertainment fairytale. They take it out of context to attract viewers. For example the nudity in the film that was unnecessary (i agree with that comment that was posted earlier) and the way they potrayed her as being this hated and used person by the people she worked with. Don't get me wrong nobody is perfect but it made her look like a victim and she was to good to be portrayed in that sad way. Obviously she was loved otherwise she wouldn't have gone as far as she did. I wonder what her loved ones would think of this movie? Personally i hope normy/mary is a happy spirit wherever she is visiting =},1038700800,2,716,4.272058823529412
803971,1,6304172761,"As a great fan of Marilyn Monroe's I can tell that this biography is bad. The only good thing in the movie is Ashley Judd's performance, she is great and really gets into her character but...Mira Sorvino is just the worst Marilyn they could find : she is not pretty , her accent sounds phony and she just looks ridiculous . And on top of that , Marilyn was far from being the marilyn you can see in this movie, even though she needed to be loved she was not dumb and was really a good actress : this movie doesn't stick to reality, skips main passages of MM's life... anyway Mira and the biography itself are terrible but Ashley's great....don't watch this if you're a MM fan !!!",1027382400,3,679,4.271317829457364
803972,4,6304172761,"I purchased this because I like Ashley Judd. It was a simple reason to buy this, but after I saw this film, I impressed about Marilyn Monroe. It is worth to possess, especially if you like Ashley Judd. She performed very well, better than other films. In this film, she was little bit chubby, but I like her very much. She is pretty and her acting always good especially in this film. Her performance was much better than Mira Sorvino was. Miras acting makes Marilyn to seem to be stupid. It was very embarrassing. I had not known well about Marilyn Monroe before I saw this film. She lived in obscurity in all her life and died when she was 36 years old. Some people said she was just a stupid sexy movie star. However, this film made me to understand her. She was a human being who wants to live a happy life just like ordinary people. Anyway, it is a good work.",1016064000,,864,4.274390243902439
803973,4,6304172761,"Norma Jean and Marilyn is a fresh, interesting approach to Marilyn's life story, focusing on her inner life rather than just being a straight bio. This film, while somewhat factually inaccurate, is a powerful portrayal of Marilyn's inner world, and I like the device of having Judd's Norma Jean confront Sorvino's Marilyn as a way of showing the internal struggle Marilyn might have felt between different facets of herself.  Ashley Judd is just dynamite as Norma Jean, starring in the beginning of the movie as a spunky, ambitious starlet and later appearing every so often as the personification of Marilyn's hidden rage once Mira Sorvino takes over the lead role as Marilyn.  Although Sorvino doesn't much physically resemble Marilyn and is somewhat hit-and-miss at replicating Marilyn's voice and mannerisms, she does a wonderful acting job and conveys Marilyn's feelings very convincingly.  Judd's later appearances in the film, as the phantom Norma Jean that represented those facets of herself that Marilyn disavowed and rejected, but couldn't rid herself of, made me think about the enormous well of rage Marilyn must have had inside of her over being abused and neglected as a child (her childhookd is affectingly shown in a series of well-integrated flashbacks) and later over being treated like a dumb blonde after she had painted herself into a corner with the sex symbol image she participated in creating.  Marilyn couldn't express her rage in an era when nice girls didn't get angry, especially as it seemed that she felt people loved her for her sweet, funny, touchingly vulnerable persona.  The movie avoids the whole ""Who killed Marilyn?"" controversy and depicts her death as a straight overdose caused by Marilyn's taking more and more pills to try and drown out the voice of her inner self Norma Jean.  Overall, I thought this was a very good film, well worth a look, an interesting idea done well by an excellent cast.",1002844800,10,1939,5.04375
803974,3,6304172761,"The idea that Marilyn suffered from multiple personalities is an intersting concept... but it was poorly executed. The acting by both Ashley & Mira was occasionally over the top. Truthfully, I think it would have been much more powerful if it had been only one actress playing both parts. Josh Charles was horrifically underused.",988848000,,329,5.111111111111111
