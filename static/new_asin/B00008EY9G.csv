1842643,5,B00008EY9G,"Have you ever been to a movie theatre, watched a movie at home, heard a good song and every day that goes by, you still can't erase it from your memory?? If so, that is what makes a production a masterpiece and that is what IDENTITY did for me. I am an avid movie buff, see approximately 220 movies yearly and review them on my radio show and for some reason I can't escape this movie. IDENTITY was not supposed to happen to me. I went to the theatre on this day to see a different movie and it was full so I didn't want to just leave without seeing something and I noticed that this was the one movie about to start without me having to wait, so I indulged. There was not a moment in this movie that did not grab me and let go. I was thoroughly entertained, in that I laughed, cried, got angry and scared all in one sitting. I felt cold when all of the characters ""disappeared"" near the end and it sent me reeling, wondering what happened to everyone. I don't want to give it away to people who have not seen it but you should make it your MOVIE PRIORITY to support this feature either in theatres or when it releases to DVD. This is EASILY my pick of the best movie I've seen since SEVEN.",1058572800,,1190,4.089743589743589
1842644,3,B00008EY9G,"Overall Good thriller, certainly not the best but satisfying.
if youve seen the trailer thts the only plot line you need to know till you actually watch the film. there are people who meet in a motel and people start dying...
the rest i don't think i ,or anyone whose seen the movie should comment on. ive seen movies which go really good the first two acts,and then fall flat in the final plot line revealing a formulaic twist. cos its the in thing. identity is different in that respect. it goes on autopilot pretty much for the first two acts then becomes ingenious on a very simple idea.
if you know thinking movies youll have it figured somewhat.
now this film doesnt give you a big shock at the end, it nurtures you through twists delivering the final act through sense. there are clues laid throughout the film,watch everything closely.
when one says that, people think it means look at the camera framing closely or what happens in the background but i don't mean that. i mean look at each character within the plot, what their motivations are,intentions, what they do at certain times etc
the film is directed well but could be way tighter, if this film was visually stylish it would become a cult classic but James Mangold cant handle the noose around a plot's neck too well, now if David Fincher (seven,fight club) directed this, it would be very very cool. during some points the movie seems like it will go down to being laughably bad..but don't let this fool you. its deliberate.
its somewhat an agatha christie whodunnit with hints of a slasher movie which turns the rules and stereotypes of horror/thriller films on its rear end.
i think thats a fair review because this film is all about plot.
its a good watch,recommended",1057968000,,1739,4.631067961165049
1842645,5,B00008EY9G,"Identity is a great movie, and one of the best mysteries in years. It is about ten strangers who all get stranded at an isolated hotel, and then die one by one. It is very similar to the Agatha Christie book ""And Then There Were None"". This movie is very suspenseful and has good writing and acting. Unfortunately, like The Sixth Sense, this movie has a love-it or hate-it surprise ending. I won't give it away, but it is very strange. I didn't like the ending very much, but I still loved the movie overall. If you like good murder mystery movies, buy Identity on dvd.",1057968000,,569,4.377358490566038

1842653,2,B00008EY9G,"It was a dark and stormy night. Several strangers, that we are slowly (very slowly) introduced to through a series of out of disordered flashbacks, are force to stay in a sleazy motel. As with all sleazy motels people start to dismantle ""Fargo"" style. The characters have the audacity to compare their situation to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" so is the last one standing the culprit? At least we are not treated to a gushy love story overlay.

Not all the gimmicks in the world can disguise this common slasher movie posing as a physiological thriller.",1509408000,,563,4.804123711340206

Parts of it are very predictable but it comes up with a good gimmick to differentiate it from the rest.  However the way its shot to present this isn't as smooth viewing as it could have been.

1842691,5,B00008EY9G,Identity is an incredibly original thriller that's very creepy and suspenseful. It has a great cast who all give great performances with John Cusack and Ray Liotta in the leads and both are at their best. It has a very intriguing premise and not one but 2 excellent twists that you won't see coming at all. I'm very surprised it wasn't a bigger hit and still isn't. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and constantly guessing and is one of those movies that is a completely different experience on the second viewing. If you haven't seen it yet it's a must see and a must own.,1471824000,,578,4.3119266055045875

This diagnosis was a fad diagnosis in the 80s- early 90s after the movie Sybil, and statistically, most psychotherapists never diagnose today (and many question its existence --outside of movies, and instead would diagnose dissociative disorder).",1470009600,,598,5.239583333333333

The intelligent viewer will experience that 'of course' moment when the light goes on and everything makes perfect sense. Hawkes squeezes every bit of tension and fear out of the situation, and his characters are spot on in their reactions to impending doom. Great movie.",1443571200,4,552,4.701030927835052

1842751,5,B00008EY9G,"Geoffs ex-wife really lost a gem of a DVD in the split.

This film will shock you to your very core. Throw your preconceived notions out the window or be sucked into a world of mystery and psychological suspense. Youll never see it coming and youll be left wondering what just happened? Youll be like wait a second, I thought this was just a horror movie. And then youll be like I didn't think that there would be a plot twist that changed the entire point of the movie. And then like I had no idea all that was leading up to that. This movie won't let you off easy, is all Im saying.

(Ill tell you right now, I knew it was gonna be the kid. I mean he was the only one that never spoke. He was creepy as hell and, well, he was a child in a murder movie. He was either going to be the killer or be the only one who could see the killer. To be fair my predictive abilities are far beyond the average movie viewer, so I cant fault the movie for the thinly veiled deception.)

The film begins with the classic horror movie trope of a dark and stormy night. Strangers converge upon an isolated motel only to find that someone is killing them off one by one. Who is the murderer? Who can be trusted? What are the characters hiding? These are questions that plague the characters of Identity. But of course none of this matters, because its all happening in somebody elses mind. Thats right! There is a whole other guy in a straight jacket somewhere else just imagining a dope-ass John Cusack movie in his mind.

And therein lies the true genius of the film. This is classic Cusack. Charming, yet brooding; heroic, yet understated; sexy, yet sloppy; relaxed, yet efficient. Cusack plays a chauffeur named Ed who used to be a cop. After a traumatic incident in the field, he loses the idealism that got him into law enforcement in the first place. When people start dying, it turns out hes a really, really good cop and he takes over (the investigation and the movie)! Cusack is the perfect man. He made you giggle in Sixteen candles. Them he got all sexy in Say Anything. Everybody was like, the kickboxing thing was stupid, but he was real cute and so romantic. Then in Grosse Point Blank, everybody was like this guy is weird, but Im into it. Of course, we all discovered his deeper side when he voiced Dimitri in Anastasia. Being John Malcovich was good. High Fidelity was dope and we were all sure he was our future husband. Then he did a string of great rom coms which could be described as Cusack porn to some people. And lest we forget Hot Tub Time Machine (1 and 2)! In the film Identity Cusack sacrifices himself so that the hero can survive. Of course its all for nothing, because the killer just keeps murdering at the end, but John Cusack will live forever.",1432339200,4,2763,4.338491295938105

  The Novelty was definately there.  It didn't really ""SCARE"" me.  And it took me about a quarter to a third of the movie to figure it out.  But the enjoyment factor & novelty factors both drew me in.  With literally an all-star cast, great acting, and an excellent script, there is nothing NOT to like about this.  I finally got this on Blu-Ray and traded in my DVD version.  And I like it just as much.

It's kind of like a non-comic ""Murder by Death"" or ""And then There Were None,"" but with a conclusion that, while startling, is more than just a solution to a mystery.

About a half hour into the movie it started to get really good. By the end of the movie I couldn't believe what I just watched. This movie has three twists in it, with the first twist being the biggest mind screw, I like to call it the 180 twist. The theme of the story is loosely based on Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians'. 10 strangers get trapped by a storm and have to wait it out at a nearby motel. One by one they start getting killed off. This may sound like the clich ""who dunnit"" type of film noir that has become so familiar in most murder mysteries, but trust me, just when you think you know where this movie is going it will take you in a 180. You will not see this twist coming, and it's not a twist which damages the story line in anyway. As a fan of movies in general, but especially horror movies and psychological thrillers, I give 'Identity' 4 stars. This movie is well worth the watch!",1376179200,5,1044,4.097560975609756
1842796,5,B00008EY9G,"While, no doubt, those who made the film are aware of Hitchcock's Motel classic, there is no need for everyone who watchhes to compare that with the Old Man's. Forget Hitchcock and watch this superior Who Dun It with a fresh mind. It is a good one. The story is simple, and, yes, one might might be reminded, as is one of the characters in this movie, of the Christie based mini-classic (starring, among others, Barry Fitzgerald) whose title was changed from that of the book to Ten Little Indians (look up the title assigned at its birth to see why it was changed). As I say, the story has a group of people blocked from further travel by flooded highways,  staying in a roadside motel, which had been built on land on which, long ago, American Indians had been forced to camp, only to die of starvation and disease. Among them is a convicted murderer and his guard, who also had been trapped by the flood. After  a bit of getting acquainted, trouble begins.
John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda  Peet, lead a talented cast in the ever more gripping drama. The story is built up neatly, piece by piece, to a surprising denouement  and counterpoint. The suspense is nicely graduated so as to keep one attuned with no accumulated fatigue to the end. This is one where knowing the end will much diminish the pleasure derived from the movie. There is sufficient violence to require care about the maturity of the viewer, but it is nothing compared to the average violent film these days.",1375315200,4,1482,4.56015037593985

1842807,4,B00008EY9G,"That's one of the repeated lines from this movie.

This must be the greatest overlooked horror movie of all time.  I've seen this twice now, and both times I was fascinated.

The entire thing takes place in a violent downpour.  I kept wondering how Hollywood creates so much constant drenching rain throughout an entire movie.
This made the entire thing extremely creepy and atmospheric.

More and more, we realize things are very strange indeed in this movie, set in a spooky old motel in the middle of the desert.  I won't give away the plot for those who haven't seen it, but if you love creepy movies you must see this.

John Cusack was his usual outstanding self, and the entire cast was excellent. The direction was also good.  I can't say anything bad about this movie, and it almost got five stars from me.  I reminded myself it's not of the caliber of a movie like Psycho, therefore only four stars.  And yet, there are plenty of moments in this where it almost is up there with the great ones.

The surprise ending is fantastic, for the viewer who loves psychological horror.  Extreme madness creates some very realistic scenarios and this shows just how real fantasies can become in the mind of someone truely unhinged.

For the horror connoiseur, this movie is a must see.  There is some gore but not a lot.  And the first version I saw was much gorier than the version I just saw tonight.  Scenes had been cut for some reason.

Why can't the characters get out of that place?  Why doesn't it ever stop raining?  Why do people keep disappearing?  The questions keep going unanswered in this, until the end, when it all comes together in the most horrific way possible, from a psychiatric standpoint.

I suggest you get some popcorn and watch this for a chilling, creepy, strange good time.  This is a pretty great horror flick.",1362873600,2,1839,4.593846153846154

I enjoyed the story in Identity; I find it unique and intriguing. It packs many thrills, many twists, and plenty of suspense. An authentic ""whodunit"" film. I particularly enjoyed the isolated setting, and the dark atmosphere it creates. I also loved how many of the deaths were unexpected and often shocking to the point of being jaw-dropping; I've seen this film before and some of the scenes still surprise me. Some of the twists and story elements are a bit predictable because of the heavy foreshadowing in the beginning and occasionally throughout the film, but I'm sure some scenes and the actual ending will surprise a few. The acting was great from most of the cast, but some actors did overact a few times. The music was great, as well. There are a few plot holes in this film, but really only if you look deep enough, so it shouldn't bother many.

Overall, Identity is a truly captivating psychological thriller; the short runtime, fast pace, and twisted storyline really demand your attention. I highly recommend purchasing this film, or renting/streaming if you're not sold yet.

As their numbers dwindle, the trapped victims are forced to trust no one except themselves. The truth will shock you and leave you saying, ""oh it's one of those movies"".

This film is very different, but it's nowhere near being original. I'll just tell you what the deal is since the movie isn't all that spectacular. The people trapped at the hotel are actually figments of a schizophrenic murderers imagination. A doctor is trying to get the man to mentally kill all the conflicting personalities within him in order to discover his true self. So the events in this movie never actually happened. After the doctor believes he has isolated the man's real and harmless personality, they proceed to haul the guy off to jail. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful and the dude kills the police transporter and gets away.

That's it. I wouldn't bother to watch this movie. It's not great, but it's not bad either. The whole multiple personality killer thing has been hashed to death. This movie is just a carbon copy of a bunch of others. Not to mention Ray Liotta is a terrible actor. You're not missing anything.",1352764800,2,1277,4.747747747747748

This film at times made me feel like I was watching a low budget movie with actors that have been in a lot of other movies but aren't famous enough to be in a real blockbuster (except John Cusack and Amanda Peet). It was a good thriller though because it kept you guessing till the very end, and even then you have to ask yourself questions about the plot.

I noticed that a few things didn't add up, but then again none of this *really* happened, so it doesn't have to be completely plausible either. The ""killer"" at the end of the movie was a little unrealistic in real life.

1842825,4,B00008EY9G,"With some big name stars such as John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Amanda Peete and Ray Liotta, Identity is a thriller which takes on the premise of Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None. In this novel, ten people, who all share a secret, are all invited to an island, and one by one they begin to die until the killer is revealed. In similar fashion, in Identity ten people by chance find themselves at a desolate hotel on a stormy night. It seems that strange luck has brought them all together, but, once there, one by one they begin to die. All the characters have vastly different personalities, so you begin to question who the killer is. Meanwhile, while the mystery at the hotel builds, the story flashes to a deranged criminal being questioned by a psychologist about brutal murders. The two stories fuse together, but it may not be as clearly defined as someone thinks.

I'll admit that the first time I saw the film; I didn't really understand it or like it. I thought the ending was a little too far-fetched and silly, and felt cheated that much of the other parts of the film ""didn't matter"" or were rendered insignificant because of those events. However, after watching the film again, I believe there are several aspects that make Identity worthwhile. It is a film that draws you in because just when you are recovering from one mystery, there is another one which enters the scene. Events happen so rapidly that you might find yourself wanting to stop it (just to catch up and mentally take note). Another great aspect about Identity is that it makes you contemplate each scene; you can't really take any moment or scene off mentally, or you may miss something. In this way, it really is a smart thriller. Unlike some thrillers that explain everything away, this is a thriller that does the exact opposite (well, until the end), leaving you to put together all the clues.

Whether you like this movie or not, or find it an effective thriller/psychological mystery will depend on whether you ""buy"" the ending. Things aren't really what they seem, and you have to view the film in terms of two distinct plot lines that only at the end of the film tie together. Those who despise Identity will take the ending to be a stunt; those who enjoy it may see it as a clever technique. We have often seen the thriller and await the twist, hoping to be able to predict it. I must say that Identity is a film that offers two puzzles. At the very least, Identity takes a different course to get to its conclusion, and separates itself in a good way from many of the predictable (blah) thrillers out there. The extra include a few deleted scenes, director commentary, and an on the set documentary.

This is a worthwhile thriller to check out.",1280275200,,2754,4.582150101419878
1842826,5,B00008EY9G,"True story, for those who are interested; when I saw this film upon it's theatrical release I was literally scared senseless since the theater was having electrical problems and the lights in the entire theater were flickering on and off through then entire movie.  The sound was distorted and the speakers kept cracking on us, and I saw this in a rinky-dink theater that was probably near being condemned (I've since moved, so I'm not sure if it is still there or not) so it all added to the atmosphere that is created so vividly in this film.  Some may balk at the `rainy night' setting and claim it is an overused clich, but that clich is rarely used to such brilliant effect.

Leave all the `flaws' at the door since this film more than makes up for them in sheer terror.

The film is a nice twist on the typical `standard' horror film, and while the twist has been spoiled by everyone and their mother, I am determined to remain silent on the midway reveal as well as the final ending `shocker' that took my by surprise.

The story revolves around a group of strangers who band together in a dusty old hotel while they strain to survive a killer in their midst.  They are picked off one by one and they are all determined to find out who is behind the slaughter, but pin-pointing the culprit is harder than it looks.

Blink and you may die.

The cast works well within their character definitions (which is important to the flow of the story and the eventual revelations at bay) to create something organic within all the horror.  John Cusack (an actor who gets slightly more respect and admiration than I deem neccisary) is actually very solid here, anchoring the films moral center without ever appearing to be the natural spout of clarity.  He is a subtle, yet profound look at the `good' in us all.  Ray Liotta is his normal clichd self, but at least he is offset by the other actors around him.  Amanda Peet is a diamond in the rough as far as I am concerned.  I kind of love her in everything she does, even though I know that she needs to work out her acting bugs.  I can't wait till she masters the talent she so obviously possesses.  Clean DuVall is a standout for me here, mainly because the `scarred teenage girl' routine is overdone so much in these films that it was nice to see her completely OWN it so effortlessly.  It felt fresher than it should have.

And Rebecca De Mornay was a total treat.

In the end, `Identity' has enough atmosphere to keep you in nightmares for days.  It is dripping with natural fear factor, and the tweaked script allows the audience to feel two very distinct types of fear; the kind that comes from scary things creeping in the night, and the kind that comes from scary thoughts bouncing around in your head.",1278979200,2,2758,4.4473161033797215

Meanwhile, in a place that is unknown a psychiatrist is trying to prove a man innocent convicted of murder. Without spoiling the film, this is all I can say about the plot.

""Identity"" is a great film that keeps you guessing to the very end. This is the way a great thriller film is made.

1842829,5,B00008EY9G,"Here is a film--the term ""movie"" is not good enough for this product--""Identity,"" which will have 340 reviews after I hit the ""Publish"" button and I had not heard of it until I picked it up from the Sale bin at a local wholesale giant. This is film making at its best.

Oh, 2003, the year the film came out--also, the year of my retirement, my divorce, new house, trip to Ireland, seminary--no wonder I am not familiar with this film. I was too busy with my own identity. ""Identity"" is such an apt title, too, for this film. Initially, I wondered what its meaning might be, but the story is so taut and full of action and never-let-go-roller-coaster-ride into the psyche that one forgets the title. Too much else to consider.

First, the story opens somewhat in the middle with important information provided. The viewer may not have any idea what this information means until much later, when it's too late (not that the viewer can do anything to help). Director James Mangold proves his title along with great editors in organizing the various plot elements into a sophisticated, cubist fashion. What seems chop, chop is not at all, but becomes a careful rendering of truth and reality, fantasy and the unreal world of horror where the characters walk and breathe. Identity. What is it? Who has it?

Mangold takes the viewer to a brink, but a brink to what? You cannot guess this one. Part of what makes the center hold is the casting. John Cusack creates one of his better roles and convinces us he is this character. Each character and the actor who plays him/her are well-drawn and made flesh by other talented actors-- Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Alfred Molino.

The setting is a motel. The time is night. All the circumstances are morbid and sinister. Who is this man who runs the motel? What's wrong with him? The movie star, tired and aging, continues her demands for more and better. Her chauffeur who is more than he seems has hit, I should say his vehicle hits the wife of a man changing his tire in a relentless storm that has encircled this group of disgruntled, sad people.  After the grotesque murders begin, Peet's character likens their story to ""And Then There Were None."" I would suggest that these people have found themselves in a twisted Lovecraft horror tale.

For twisted and horror describe the hidden part of the story. There, I've said enough. Identity. What is it? Who has it? When and why?",1258416000,2,2434,4.648837209302326
1842830,3,B00008EY9G,"This is a good psycho-thriller, in a wonderful atmosphere of drenching rain.  It is fun because the viewer is kept wondering what is going on - there is surprise after surprise, and the mystery keeps this from sinking into a normal slasher film.  There are many layers.  I was entertained right up to the end and did not guess what was going on, in spite of all the clues and abrupt shifts in point of view.  In addition, the cast of actors is very very good, from Cusack to DeMornay and the phenomenal Amanda Peet - they each metamorphose wonderfully as the viewer tries to figure out what is going on.

Unfortunately, this is one of those films based on a single deceptive idea.  Once you get it, that's that.  It is not one that you can watch over and over for additional detail, much like Mamet's House of Games.  Moreover, that idea is not at all subtly used, when I think it could have been, but comes off as a caricature of a far more complex phenomenon.  As such, it cannot enter the pantheon of great films I own.

1842855,4,B00008EY9G,"The movie begins with a subplot of a killer's interview.  Next, on a dark and stormy night, many lives will come together.  George York (John C. McGinley - Dr. Cox from Scrubs) along with his wife Alice and stepson Timothy have a blowout.  Alice is hit by limo driver Ed (John Cusack) driving movie star Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay).  They rush to the closest phone, which is at an out-of-the-way hotel.  Joining them for the evening, also trapped by the storm and flooding, is hooker Paris (how appropriate) played by Amanda Peet, and Officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey - don't Busey's make the best bad guys?), and a young couple whose passtime is arguing.

Rhodes' prisoner escapes, and then people begin to turn up dead.  Secrets are revealed, there are arguments, a lot of creeping around in the rain, and nail-biting suspense.  But there's more to this movie than just the typical whodunit.  Where is the connection between these people?  The key to the puzzle is much more complex than you think.  The plot twists and twists again in a most satisfying manner.  I can't say any more without revealing spoilers.

John Cusack and Ray Liotta give stellar performances, and John C. McGinley is good in everything he does.  The film is well photographed and the atmosphere is sufficiently dreary to create the required mood.  This is a great movie for a group of friends and a large bowl of buttered popcorn.

1842856,5,B00008EY9G,"My son brought this film home from the local rental place and, though having never heard of it, I decided to watch it on the strength of the cast, which is stellar. I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric, and intriguing thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy motel in the middle of nowhere.

There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues.

There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, ""Gotcha!"".

This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep even the most jaded viewers on their toes. While the performances of the entire cast are uniformly excellent, special kudos go to John Cusack for a truly powerful, memorable performance. Bravo!",1174867200,2,1622,4.625

1842858,5,B00008EY9G,"A solid script backed up by a great cast, John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John c. McGinley, Alfred Molina, Amanda Peet and more, are all outstanding. Brilliantly directed by James Mangold who also directed Copland, Girl Intrerupted and Walk The Line, this is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. To say too much about the script would possibly give it away, but in the style of the Agatha Christie's novels 'Ten Little Indians' and  'Murder on the orient express', where people start dying in suspicious circumstances and later they find out they are all connected in some way. In this movie we have ten complete strangers stranded at a desert motel for the night. Sure enough people start getting killed, there is a lot of finger pointing and plenty of twists along the way to keep the audience engaged. The music score is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the whole movie. Special features include bonus trailers, an on the set documentary and 2 very informative and interesting commentaries. One by the director and one by the writer, the latter being the better of the two. The disc features both cinema and DVD versions, although the DVD version only includes 2 extra scenes that last no longer than 30 seconds each. The only fault I have of the movie is that it seems too much time was spent in the first half of the movie bringing the characters together and laying a foundation forcing the ending to seem rushed through to conclude the movie within the 90 minutes, instead of the film being possibly edited longer. All up though, one of the best thrillers you will ever see. I have seen it many times and it is still good even when you know the ending.",1161561600,11,1671,4.60738255033557

It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release!  Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing.  Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make ""Identity"" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time.  If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever.

The whole movie had this eerie, creepy feeling about it.  The story does hold it's own, though it does ""borrow"" from two masters of mystery; Ms Agatha Christie and Sir Alfred Hitchcock.  Once the ""twist"" comes in, even my wife (who figured out the ending to ""American Haunting"", ""Silent Hill"", ""The Others"") said ""OH MY!"" and we both bought the movie a couple days after it came out on DVD.

The reason for the 4 star rating was that the ""Extended Alternative Ending"" added about 3 seconds-if that-to the trip in the van.

SPOILER: I didn't really understand the basis behind most of the victims relation to each other, mainly the birthdates and the states their last names represented; but after watching it a couple times, it dawned on me.  What easier way to make up identities for multiple personalities than to have similar dates of birth or names one can recognize (names of states).

I do appreciate Cusak's roles nowadays, but I think he's being too typecast as a romcom star.  Come over to Drama, Jon!  It's a lot easier to win an Oscar or Golden Globe when you star next to Newman, Hanks, and are directed by Spielberg and Howard.",1150329600,6,1359,4.532786885245901

1842863,4,B00008EY9G,"Even though the plot device of characters with split personalities or multiple personalities has been done before, Identity is at least clever with it. This is a really good movie.

The movie goes like this: 11 people end up at a motel due to a bad rainstorm and flooding. Once there, the people start getting knocked off one by one. Think of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None meets Psycho.

There's the former cop turned limo driver played by John Cusack, driving a self-centered movie star played by Rebecca DeMornay.

The former prostitute trying to get to Florida to grow an orange grove played well by Amanda Peet.

The young, newly married couple who are far from happy, played by Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott.

A convict and the deputy escorting him to another prison. Played by Jake Busey and Ray Liotta respectively.

The misogynistic hotel manager who has a couple of secrets.-John Hawkes

An older married couple and their young son.-John C. McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Brett Loehr

The events happening at the motel are cut in every once in a while by a late-night meeting going on between a psychiatrist and a judge and several other people. The psychiatrist's patient, Pruitt Taylor Vince, looks like Uncle Fester from The Addams Family and is about to be executed shortly after. The shrink is trying to convince the judge that his patient need not be executed. For most of the time watching the film, you don't understand what the people at the motel have to do with this other subplot. Some might be confused as to what the heck is going on, but the tie-in is pretty clever.

Some spoilers below.

The people at the motel are the 11 different personalities of the Uncle Fester dude that he developed because of years of abuse and neglect. One of these personalities is responsible for a murder rampage the guy went on, which is why he is on death row. The shrink is trying to convince people that he can get one of the personalities to kill the evil personality so Uncle Fester won't do anything else evil.

The 11 are there to do battle but don't know it. The doctor eventually taps John Cusack's former cop limo driver, who signifies the strong, good but flawed personality, and tells him what he has to do.

Problem is, more than one personality is bad, and it becomes a red herring fest to figure out who is responsible for the murders.

It is oodles and noodles better than Twisted and Taking Lives and Hide and Seek and Secret Window and plenty of other thrillers that have come out in the past 5 or so years. But I guess this still isn't saying much is it?

Thirdly and most important, this is the best role of  John Cusack's career, and this fact alone is worth whatever price you pay for this movie.  Let's face it.

The previews looked great. I was really looking forward to this stellar, star-studded cast in a *ah-em* ""film"" full of atmosphere.  So,  this film LOOKS great; it is wonderfully shot.  The acting is very good.  That's the best I can say for it.  It's the story stupid.

This *ah-em* ""film"" actually left me feeling angry and cheated when I saw it in the theater and I can only think of one other film I'd ever seen that left me angry and feeling cheated:  ""History of the World Part I""

I'm very surprised that Liotta and Cusack agreed to do this... did they even read the entire script?  Anyone who gives this movie more than two stars does not know anything about tension, suspense, mystery, and plot development.  If I had to vote for the lamest thriller of all time this would surely be it (DeNiro's Hide and Seek is a close second).

There's a point in the movie where any astute viewer will say to himself or herself ""oh, this is all in somebody's head""  At that point, anyone with half a brain realizes there isn't a real character to invest in, i.e., worry about.  You can't invest yourself emotionally in someone who is a just make-believe person in some nut-job's head, no matter how nice or attractive the make-believe person might be.  Who really cares if the make-believe person in the nut-job's head gets carved up or pick-axed to death?  ""Oh no!  Look out little figment of the nut-job's imagination, the killer is right behind you!  Run little figment of the nut-job's imagination, run!""  Paaaaahleeeeze! There are no characters to invest in so the premise does not work.  This was so stupid I'm surprised to find myself writing a review.  Note to self: ""how stupid am I for wasting my precious time writing a review for something that was so stupid?""  The fact that this *ah-em* film appears to have garnered an average of 4 star reviews is the only plot twist this *ah-em* film has going for it.  I mean, I knew the general public were easily pleased but COME ON FOLKS.  This was lame!  Lame Lame LAME!

A few months later I saw the movie (DVD) Apathy (I think that's the title) with Nick Cage.  That particular film was actually released earlier than Identity.  Cage's character has a brother who keeps talking about making a movie that takes place in someone's head and Cage's character considers totally stupid.  The plot described for that make believe movie idea is what became Identity in real life.  I had to laugh right out loud when I realized someone had tested the concept. Average movie-going audiences sure are stupid.  Even my friend liked Identity and couldn't understand why I thought it was so stupid.",1134604800,7,2782,4.612244897959184

One word : HECTIC!

Great cast (John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, et al) all get intertwined in a story that just keeps you guessing and pointing fingers.

The setting (your basic horror/thriller ingredients), a dark and stormy night, plenty of rain and a group of strangers get stuck together at a creepy motel.

One by one the ""Ten Little Indians"" start dissapearing... and now we have to find out who is responsible...

A nice bit of jumping back and forth from ""present"" to ""past"" adds to the suspense.

Expect a stunning ""USUAL SUSPECTS"" style, break-neck twist that comes at you out of nowhere!

John Cusack has also always been one of those hugely dependable and under-rated actors and he is superb in this... as is Ray Liotta.

1842870,3,B00008EY9G,"I truly enjoyed director James Mangold's ""Cop Land"" and was looking forward to spinning this one on DVD - ""Identity"" has one of the best ensemble casts assembled in recent years and gets off to a great start.

But then it all comes apart, and the script just gets way too smart, toying with the audience as if the scriptwriter was thumbing his nose at the viewers and saying: ""Hey I AM smarter than you.""

And I hate it when people do something like that. I am all for twists in films - some the greatest films of all time are built around such a premise, including ""The Third Man"", ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Rashomon"". But ""Identity"" ends up being too smart for its own good and the twist really leads to a unfulfilling conclusion.

But ""Identity"" also has lots to recommend it - the great cast, Mangold's terrific pacing and the nice chills that come along at a clip in the first two-thirds of the movie.

The story? Well, one dark rainy night, a bunch of characters get stuck in a motel in Nevada that could give the Bates Motel from ""Psycho"" a run for its money. There's the limo driver (John Cusack) transporting a movie star (Rebecca DeMornay), a young couple that just got married in Las Vegas, a prostitute (Amanda Peet) who's heading back home to make a fresh start, and a cop (Ray Liotta) escorting a nasty convicted murderer (Jake Busey).

But when the cast starts getting killed off one by one, tensions flare up and a desperate hunt begins for the killer.

At the same time, all of this is somehow tied in to a psychiatrist (Alfredo Molina) in a faraway city trying to prove that a serial killer (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is insane so that his execution - slated for the next morning - can be stayed.

Just how are these two situations connected? Well, you'll have to watch ""Identity"" to find that out!!

This one's a nice ride, but when you do reach the destination, you only end up feeling like you've been taken for a ride.",1132531200,3,1928,4.441926345609065
1842871,4,B00008EY9G,"Alright, i live in Hong Kong and this movie was never put on the widescreen here. I bought this DVD just out of its cast. From reading the description at the sleeve of the DVD, i do not expect to get much out of it, assuming just another killer-among-the-group-in-a-contained-place sort of movie. But as it turns out, it makes my jaw drops.

Going through the review before writing this one down, i do not understand why some of the folks are so mean and critical about the film. If you have a habbit of reading review before making your purchase, you probably won't find one film without a 1-star rating, whether deemed helpful or not.

The point is, if you really have to be so picky, you can always find things to critize. But just do not forget one thing, what you are watching is just a story, and there is one thing in film called the ""suspension of disbelief"". Not even in reality that you can find all things explainable or logical or even sensible!!! And please do not compare this film with Hitchcock's, for his reputation in psychological thriller has already convinced some part of you to believe his film is great even before the title sequence ends.

Back to the film itself, i am not going to prasie once again for what others did. What i wanted to add is that when the final mystery unfolds, it reallys makes my jaw drops. Surpirse at the same time but also an anti-climax. Beacuse what seems to be the reality is now just a twisted imagination of a convicted murderer, so why cares more what happens in the motel afterthat anyway? With all the suspense gone, i am just waiting to see how the film is going to wrap up without further expectation.

However, i do want to give a merit to the director for his attention to details of the plot. Seldom you will see this kind of film without any contraction in its plot (at least i have found none) Throughout the film, you will see very very subtle evidence hinting towards a more supernatural ending rather than just some fxxp-up psycho who happens to kill people for fun. One point to note is with all these killing, there is hardly any gore at all, so the horror is convinced to you psychologically rather than through some cheap visual violence.",1131062400,,2211,4.478908188585608
1842872,3,B00008EY9G,"This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film. Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night. One by one they are getting murdered. It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters. There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.

John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop. Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner. There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word. There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.

But this is not a usual ""whodunit"". No way. The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed. To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.

Yes, it held my interest. Yes, there was some good acting. But I hated the ending and felt the writer had played a rotten trick on the audience. That's why I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.",1129161600,2,1241,4.434210526315789

1842878,4,B00008EY9G,"Starring John Cusack and Ray Liotta, Identity is a film which opened to little of the commercial fanfare associated with a blockbuster movie. But this is a film that packs all of the suspense and entertainment value of The Sixth Sense into an original screenplay about a serial killer on the loose. Haunting in its presentation, yet far from a traditional horror film, Identity follows the exploits of ten strangers who become stranded at a Nevada hotel in the midst of a massive rainstorm. One-by-one, they are being killed off, but no one knows the true identity of the killer...

A number of seemingly unrelated people gather at a small roadside motel in a Nevada desert location. Strangers to each other, the people descend from all different types of professions and lifestyles - a limousine driver and his movie star client, a policeman (Ray Liotta) transporting a convict, two parents with their young son, a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a young couple, and the motel's manager (John Hawkes). All of them are trapped on the grounds of the motel due to a record rainstorm that's made the roads impassable. Beset by darkness, each of the motel guests resigns to his fate and settles down to ride out the storm. The guests even make an attempt to socialize with one another.

But when one motel guest turns up dead, suspicions are raised. When it's revealed that an escaped convict, (Jake Busey), is on the loose, the guests become panicked. Ed (John Cusack) becomes de facto leader of the small group of strangers who begin suspect each other when the convict is captured and the killings continue. Is the true killer among them? Or is someone else (or something else) on the motel grounds with them? Far away, in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is feverishly attempting to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder, and the answer lies right before him...

Although it's a decent film, Identity falls into the teenage horror film device of having each character wander off alone - despite the fact that people who wander off alone continually turn up dead. However, I'm usually willing to overlook such things if the rest of the film is decent because a movie's objective is to entertain, and Identity does that...

The darkness of the setting, coupled with intermittent thunder and the pattering of rain, create an all-encompassing sense of suspense bordering on fear. Rain muffles sound, so how can you hear if someone's sneaking up behind you? Identity is a unique and original film most movie lovers will enjoy. The plot device is employed with the utmost efficiency, keeping the audience guessing until the very end. Who is the real killer? You'll have to watch Identity to find out...

Presenting a knockout performance by John Cusack, Identity is one of the surprise films of 2003. The dialogue is fresh, not stiff, and the characters are well-rounded considering many of them do not live through most of the scenes. With a surprise ending reminiscent of 1990s smash hits, The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, Identity (although nowhere near as good as those films) is a film you won't want to miss. Due to its well-written storyline and crescendo of suspense, Identity is a definite must-see movie...

The best kind of movie is the one where you don't see it coming - the end just hits you out of the blue. Unbreakable was the last one to come close. This one was right on the money. John Cusack was brilliant, as usual, Ray Liotta was wonderfully creepy, Amanda Peet was the usual, unfortunate blank spot in the middle of the screen, but over all the acting was good, the writing was good, and if you're into MultiFlicks (movies about characters with multiple personalities) this should be at the top of your list.",1112659200,,647,4.4
1842880,5,B00008EY9G,"This was a top rate thriller. The murders, the dark, almost gothic atmosphere, the guesses as to whom the killer was and then watching those guesses disappear when your suspect was murdered - superbly done.

The acting was first rate, especially Cusack. So was the cinematography. You could feel the pelting rain in the film falling on your own shoulders.

There was - what seemed - to be a subplot to the film. There was the issue of a stay of execution for a serial murderer that seemed to be unrelated to the film. I'm embarrassed to say that instead of realizing that this was an integral part of what was happening at the motel, I put it into the back of my mind. So to future viewers of this: pay close attention.

Moreover, if I had been more aptly observant in the beginning of the film (although to be fair, I'm hard of hearing and the closed captioning wasn't working, so I had a difficult time catching the dialogue), it would have been easier to tie the subplot to what seemed to be the main plot - the executions.

Then the ingenuity of the film kicked in. We saw that what was at stake was the multiple personality disorder of the serial killer - and this too we should have seen. I imagine (hope?) I wasn't the only one who didn't tie together the beginning, the stay of execution, and the commonalities shared with the victims at the motel. I was mesmerized as the truth began to unfold, although to be honest I would have liked a little more unraveling at the hands of the filmmakers. In my opinion, there should have been more work between the psychologist and the patient. There were a number of ways that could have been achieved without giving anything away, but I can understand why the filmmakers decided not to address it. Still, when we were let onto the BIG SECRET, it would have been nice to have been walked through it, simply because there are a lot of people who simply didn't get the ending at all.

I can understand how it could be easy for someone watching the film not to understand the final scene. In fact, I didn't figure it out until this very moment. In order to get a stay of execution, the serial killer needed to dispel all of his murderous or disturbed identities. The people who were involved in the meeting where his stay of execution was being debated believed that he had.

Don't think in linear terms when you reach the end, because if you do the ending will seem trite and contrived when in fact it is brilliant. Instead, think of the need to exorcise all of the negative personalities, and pay no attention whatsoever to the actual events at the motel. Those events may - or may not (hehe) - be a fantasy, or a re-creation to perform said exorcism.",1110844800,,2698,4.429435483870968

1842885,4,B00008EY9G,"""The silence of the Lambs"" was the real beginning of this subgenre of memorable pictures like ""The silence..."" itself or ""The sixth sense"". Some other like ""12 Monkeys"" and a lot of them which arised in the late 90's could kill the psycho-thriller movie.

I am pleased to see that this sort of movies regarding to the deep obscure thoughts of ill minds are alive and well. I can even feel the difference between the first and the second of Ripley's movies. The first, with Damon, is mediocre and even boring. The second, with Malkovich, is superb.

This ""Identity"" is in the good road, but not the 10 characters which are entrapped in a motor-hotel isolated of all contact by road, by phone or by radio. The series of crimes makes it a decent suspense movie at the beginning, but the irruption of one of the characters in a late night trial, converts the movie in a great psycho-thriller.

Actors are fine. I'm really becoming a Cusack's fan, becuase all his acting is really convincing, but not so much from Liotta. Amanda Peet is also to be acclaimed.

Anyway, I won't say anything else, because it is very important to keep the emotion until the end. Just see it until the end, because the resolution is the best of the movie. As it has to be.",1106956800,,1246,4.5
1842886,4,B00008EY9G,"After seeing the trailer for Identity (2003), I got the impression it was a horror film with a number of recognizable actors you wouldn't normally see in straight up horror film, and that intrigued me.  After seeing the movie, feeling a little duped by the trailer (there's few things as aggravating as a misleading trailer, except for a trailer that shows all the best parts), I was a little surprised to see it was much more than I assumed, being a decent mystery/thriller with slight horror undertones.  Directed by James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted, Kate & Leopold), the film stars John Cusack (High Fidelity, Serendipity), Amanda Peet (Saving Silverman, Something's Gotta Give), and Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), three actors I generally like, although Liotta's star quality still suffers with me from his appearing in the 1997 turkeyfest Turbulence (a film which systematically dismantled Liotta's costar Lauren Holly's budding career, forcing her into the realm of television for quite some time).  Other notable appearances are made by Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2), John C. McGinley (Stealing Harvard), Jake Busey (Fast Sofa), weird eye guy Pruitt Taylor Vince (Nurse Betty), and Rebecca De Mornay (The Hand That Rocks the Cradle), sporting the biggest set of fake hoo hoos I've seen in a long time.

The story, mostly taking place at a lonely Nevada motel, features a group of people brought together under curious and seemingly coincidental circumstances, stranded as they're caught in the middle of a heavy rainstorm (yes, it does rain in the desert on occasion, and usually pretty hard) due to the fact the road leading away from the motel in either direction is washed out.  It's an interesting mix of characters, a limo driver (Cusack), a prostitute (Peet), an officer (Liotta) transporting a convicted criminal (Busey), a family of three, a newlywed couple, and a seemingly once popular actress, whose star has since faded (at the very least, she's still got the huge rack).  Shortly after our soggy assemblage has an opportunity to get acquainted with each other, their number begins to dwindled as someone within the group is eliminating them one by one, leaving evidence indicating there may be a pattern.  Maybe someone should call the police...but wait!  The phones are out, and the only cell phone among the group can't make a connection (with the advent of cell phones, many thriller/horror films have had to resort to the old `I can't get a signal' contrivance to justify why a character can't phone for help, either that or they actually have the phone get damaged or the battery be depleted).  Now, those who haven't suffered a terminal case of death must try and figure out not only who among them is a killer, but why (we later learn there's a connection between the individuals present), before those left meet the same, grisly fate.

The positives of the film are many, including a strong cast, led by Cusack (remember the days when he only seemed to do silly comedies?  Who knew back then he would evolve into dramatic roles as well as he did?) and Liotta (the two played against each other nicely, enough so I wouldn't mind seeing them appear in something else together).  The rest of the cast follows suit, but given the collective professional experience in their backgrounds, I wouldn't have expected less.  The direction by Mangold is tight, and it's obvious he knows how to create suspense and deliver the goods (there were a few `pop outs', or basically throwing something at the viewer to create a quick, cheap scare, but Mangold seemed to be able to present it in such a way where it wasn't as obvious as it would have been with a lesser director).  The photography was really beautiful, deftly using the rain in such a way as to accentuate the story, and also to keep the viewer engaged.  I also thoughts the sets were detailed and realistic, giving the film a dark, brooding quality, much like that of David Fincher's film Se7en (1995).  The biggest problem I had with the movie was related, in a small way, to the ending and the revelation of the identity of the killer in that films that utilized dream sequences (there are none here) or similar plot contrivances seem to use them in such a way as to forgo justifying various details and unexplained events as to say to the audience, `Well, because of the context of the occurrence of the details and/or events, we don't have provide any reasoning, and you just have to accept it'.  Now, I don't need a reasoning or rational for everything, as I'd like to believe I'm intelligent enough to extrapolate these things from myself, so long as the story is adept enough to provide the basic necessities to do so...but that wasn't always the case here (an example being the entire Indian burial mounds aspect, and its' introduction with regards to the killings possibly being supernatural in nature).  I did appreciate the inclusion of various clues, not so much relating to who the killer was, but who the killer wasn't.  The concept put forth by the story in this regard certainly was interesting (and entertaining), but the execution seemed a little weak.

The DVD features both anamorphic widescreen (2:35:1) and the pan & scan (1:33:1), allowing the viewer to choose their preferred format, both looking very clean and sharp.  The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1, and comes though very clearly.  Special features include a commentary track by the director, a `Starz' on-set featurette, storyboard to scene comparisons, deleted scenes, selected filmographies, and the ability to choose to view the original theatrical release, or a slightly extended version of the film (I believe this last feature is only available in the widescreen format).  Normally I'd probably rate this three stars, but due to the strengths (especially the cast), I'm willing to go to four stars.  I'd recommend renting before buying, though, as I see little value in repeat viewings.

1842888,4,B00008EY9G,"Identity is a rare type of horror movie. All of the characters relatively avoid stupid actions that would otherwise have them killed off. Also, the film manages to pull off a feeling of suspense fairly well. Our story begins with 10 strangers being holed up in a ratty motel together during a harsh thunderstorm. Among the people there, a limo driver, a washed up actress, a cop escorting a convict convicted of murder, a prostitute, two newlyweds, and a troubled family. The motel is run by a suspicious guy named Larry who is getting a little too involved in everyones businness. All are guests are doing well, save the wife of a troubled stepfather who was hit by a car during the storm. Every ones enjoying their stay, until the movie star shows up in a dryer decapitated. After that incident, some of the guests begin freaking out, particularly the newlyweds who get into a savage fight. Also, the convict has broken loose from his shackles and is wondering around the motel, his location unknown. Now the fun begins, the husband to Ginny is found stabbed, the convict has had a baseball bat shoved down his throat, and all the while noone knows who is going to die next. That's part of the fun though, trying to unravel the mystery, and discover the killer. However, my major gripe with this movie is that the character of Ginny is extremely annoying, and to tell you the truth, I couldn't be happier when I witnessed her death. The ending was actually pretty good. When you first find out the twist, you'll probably think it's pretty weak, but believe me, it gets way better.

1842890,3,B00008EY9G,"First of all, beware of some reviews posted here that will spoil the ending of the movie. This is a pretty cool little thriller, and I promise not to give away any of the storyline. The movie does borrow heavily from other films of the genre, and I kept finding myself thinking of those other movies while watching this one. Add elements of ""And Then There Were None"" mix it with ""Momento"" and add a touch of ""The Sixth Sense"" and this is the movie that you get. John Cusack and Ray Liotta are always fun to watch, and Amanda Peet does a good job here too. (Is she in every movie made these days?) The rain soaked motel is a great setting for a thriller, and really gives you a good sense of isolation. I guess the biggest problem with the movie is that the director never lets the suspense build, you get a taste and then the scene is resolved. You don't get a prolonged build up that keeps you squirming with ""Identity"", it's almost like a whole string of little suspenseful scenes tied together. If you like a decent thriller ""Identity"" isn't bad, but it's not something you will go back to and watch again and again.",1093478400,5,1120,4.338095238095238

1842892,3,B00008EY9G,"Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller. As 10 strangers (including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm, suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst. Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far, far away from the motel.

For about 60 minutes, this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked. Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. But it came too early and led the film into stupidness.

It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool, even if it doesn't last very long. But, in the end, I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this. But what do you expect from the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman?

1842896,5,B00008EY9G,"Sick and tired of those ordinary thrillers that are all fluff and very little substance?  'Identity' may be the answer that you're looking for, as it is a clever and dark thriller with a solid story, a terrific cast and a great look and feel to it all.  The film revolves around ten strangers who end up at a little motel due to a horrible storm.  All of them have been brought there by chance... or, is it a little more complicated than that?  They think they're out of the woods until people start getting butchered left and right, in a countdown fashion.  What appears to be nothing more than a murderer on the loose having his or her fun ends up being something a lot more sinister and threatening.  Have these ten individuals been picked at random, or have their fates been sealed from the very beginning?

When I started watching this, I thought to myself, 'Oh boy, I bet you I know exactly how this is going to end.'  I was wrong.  The film takes a lot of clever and unexpected twists that really goes to show you how great a thriller can really be if the right brains are behind it all.  It has some great suspense and frightening moments, an intriguing plot that likes to play around with your mind, and it delivers a very confident presentation.  You'll recognize a good majority of the cast, as some of them include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet and Rebecca DeMornay.  All are great, especially Cusack who proves that he can be a successful lead role in a top-notch thriller.

The DVD has some cool goodies to offer.  You can watch it in widescreen or fullscreen, depending on which is your preference.  You also have the choice to watch the theatrical cut, or the extended version (not to be mistaken for a 'director's cut').  I must be honest and admit that the extended version is really not worth it.  The added scene does nothing to enhance the movie and the so-called 'alternate ending' isn't alternate at all, as it is merely extended by only a few seconds.  It was interesting to watch, but again it really doesn't do anything special for the film.  Stick with the theatrical version, then watch the extended version if you're still curious.  Trust me, the theatrical version is the way to go.  Other bonuses included on the DVD are deleted scenes, commentary, storyboard comparisons, theatrical trailer, filmographies and a behind the scenes featurette.  The film looks and sounds great.

'Identity' is definitely something that should be checked out by those who are tired by the usual flops that dare to call themselves 'thrillers.'  This is a successful and smart thriller that offers chills along with an impressive script and cast.  Just be sure to give it a chance.  You may think you have it all figured out when it starts, but trust me when I tell you that this movie will play around with your brain until the ending credits.  A more than well-done thriller that doesn't disappoint and is worth re-watching again and again. -Michael Crane",1090627200,92,2974,4.625954198473282
1842897,5,B00008EY9G,"One of the best psychological thrillers made since Jacob's Ladder.  This ensemble cast is perfectly blended to offer the right mix of fresh talent (Amanda Peet and Jake Busey) and seasoned veterans (Ray Liota, Alfred Molina and John Cusak) along with Rebecca DeMornay.  You will be drawn in with the rhythmic poetry recited in the opening scenes and once the story begins at the desert Motel, you are absolutely riveted.  There are key clues throughout to sort of clue you in to the shock at the end, but don't ruin it by talking to others about it!  Watching the director's commentary is helpful on the DVD, explaining odd scenes and intricate story lines to the viewer.  This movie is one you will want to watch more than once or twice.  You get most of the plot only superficially the first time watching, and only on the the second and third go around will you say, ""AH HA!  Now this makes sense!""

As it was, we stayed through the credits hoping to catch the name of the psychiatric consultant so we could send a poison pen letter. Wisely, no psychiatrist allowed his or her name to be associated with that movie.
I did not find the end of the movie surprising, because it was similar to some of the ""multiple personality"" themes that were once popular in daytime soap operas. I suspect that modern soap opera audiences are now sufficiently sophisticated to see through that old theme.

1842902,4,B00008EY9G,"The best part about ""Identity"" is that it didn't drag on for long amounts of time, and it felt like it started right away. It stars John Cusack from ""Serendipity"" and this is a totally different kind of movie. ""Serendipity"" being a sweet, romantic comedy, while ""Identity"" is a dark and disturbing thriller. It is loosely based on the mystery story ""And Then There Was One"" written by crime writer Agatha Cristie. I never read the story, so I can't say how similar the two are, but I know the basic ideas, and both of the stories are pretty much the same, plot wise. An istant problem with ""Identity"" is Ray Liotta who is a terrible actor. He is similar to Dennis Quiad, who is worse. Dennis Quaid seems to overact in every movie that I see him in, including ""The Alamo"" and ""Far From Heaven."" Liotta also overacts, only he does it worse. He never seems to be able to grab his character and steer him in the right direction. It always feels like he is reading his lines on a cue card taped on a wall. Amanda Peet was in the movie. She is a cute little actress, who is good in ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""The Whole Ten Yards,"" but this is another actress who is in a totally different role based on her past movies. The rest of the cast seems to be filled with unknowns except for Prutt Taylor Vince who is thought was good in ""Simone"" as well as Alfred Molina, who having no clue who he was when I saw this in the theatre, but recently saw him in the comic gem ""Coffee and Cigarettes.""
""Identity"" starts off with the audience being introduced to Malcolm Rivers. He is charged with such a heavy crime, that he is about to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist wants to prove that Rivers is not mentally able to be the person to commit the crimes, and he convinced a judge to stand before Rivers and check again to make sure he didn't really commit his crimes. Miles away in a small hotel, a flash flood has brought many strangers together. George, his wife Alice, and his stepson Timmy have pulled into a hotel after an accident injured Alice. The accident had Alice getting hit by limo driver Ed, who hit her while they were changing a tire. Ed is bringing the former famous actress Caroline to wherever she needs to be. They go to the hotel after learning that the roads are flooded, and it turns out that the phones at the hotel do not work because of an accident involving a women named Paris hitting the telephone polls. Two more clusters of people come to the hotel. One is a cop named Rhodes who is bringing a murderer to someplace, and a newlywed couple. All of these people rent rooms in the hotel from Larry, and everything is alright. They agreed to wait until the storm lets up to get help. Everything is going fine until one of the guests die in a brutal way. Everyone is shocked and one by one the guests begin to die, as the remaining people try to figure out who is doing the killing, and who is going to be killed next, while also trying not to be killed, all leading up to a surprising and shocking conclusion.
""Identity"" is a great thriller, and it is short enough to never be distracted by it. It seemed like it went very fast, and it only clocked in at around 95 minutes. I was really impressed by the ending, and it's one of those movies where you can't have anybody tell you what happens. It would only ruin the experience for you. Even though some movies with a surprise twist are easy to watch again, like ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Godsend"" this is not one of them. This is one of those movies where the twist affects the entire movie. In order not to ruin the movie, watch ""Identity"" and watch ""Matchstick Men"" back to back. The entire movie of ""Identity"" is based on the twist, and without it, it would be a totally different movie. The twist makes the movie better than it really is, even though this is a good movie. It is very entertaining, fun, and it has it share of good acting. Watch it once without anybody interrupting or ruining it for you, and then remember it, because it'll be better if you don't see it again. Leave a fresh image of this movie in your mind.
ENJOY!

The survivors must find out who's the killer before it's too late!,1087430400,,328,4.39344262295082

The logic remains true throughout - a big plus for me because I hate it when movies aren't even true to their own logic.  The movie sucks you in from the start - you need to pay attention from the very first frame on - and doesn't let up as we find ten people stuck in an out-of-the-way motel during a bad storm.  Then, as if there wasn't enough stuff going on, people start getting murdered.  It just keeps getting better.  I was surprised by seeming twists in the plot and reviewing found no major holes.

Just for this alone I would give it four stars. Add to this a very good actors ensemble, especially great perfomance by John Cusack, very fast pace of the movie (a lot of things are packed into 90 minutes, which could be good or bad) and good suspense. On the weak side, I felt that a movie plot was too much for me to handle - not because of its complexity (it's actually quite straighforward and logical) but rather because of too much action compressed in so short time. But maybe it's just me. Overall, recommended to anybody who likes thrillers with good suspense.",1085788800,,792,4.545454545454546
1842907,2,B00008EY9G,"Director:  James Mangold
Cast:  John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea Duvall.
Running Time:  90 minutes.
Rated R for violence, gore, and language.
One of the most bizarre thrillers to ever hit the screen, ""Identity"" attempts to pull off a ""Sixth Sense"" style finale, but fails miserably with a disjointed, confusing story that is well-made and well-acted, but ultimately fails to follow logic.  It is a film that jumps into action extremely quick, with a family fixing a flat tire in the middle of the pouring rain on a deserted highway.  Ex-cop turned limousine driver John Cusack accidentally hits the mother of the family while she was attempting to help her husband with the fix-up, but they cannot drive to the hospital for medical attention due to the horrific weather.  They find a place to stay and tend to the woman's wounds in a ratty, old Bates-like motel.
In all, ten strangers find themselves at the mysterious motel fighting for their lives against an unknown killer that is walking the premises.  They are many twists and turns, points fingered at numerous killers, and so many strange occurrences in the last ten or 15 minutes of the film that is it hard to distinguish exactly what is the truth and what is not real.  Cusack and Liotta give suitable performances in the lead roles, but certainly nothing spectacular-the rest of the cast is not given much of a personality, mainly used as cookie cutter characters that the audience does not give a flip about if they are slaughtered.  ""Identity"" is a nice attempt at trying to bring some psychosis/schizophrenia terror to the suspense genre, but director Mangold seems more focused on making scary scenes with lightning and down-pouring rain that creating a film that is halfway understandable.  Some of the DVD extras are slightly useful, although the extended version is basically the same motion picture.  A thriller that had promise, but it does not succeed in establishing exactly what kind of movie it wants to be, loosing its own identity in the process.",1085616000,3,2060,4.92485549132948
1842908,4,B00008EY9G,"IDENTITY didn't make great waves at the Australian box office, and I am surprised by that. I finally saw it on DVD recently and was very impressed by it, and consider it one of the best films of 2003.
10 characters end up at a Bates-like Motel, with seemingly nothing in common.  When people start dying, it becomes a case of who-dunnit. To tell anymore would give it away, but let me say it is one of the most original twist endings I have seen in a long time.
John Cusack is excellent, as is Ray Liota.  Rebecca Mornay makes a comeback in this film, if only for 10 minutes.  You will not recognise her at first with her brunette hair.
Ignore the negative reviews, Identity is a clever and imaginative film which blew me away! I had the DVD in my possession for awhile choosing not to watch it because of its poor performance at the box office.

John Cusack is excellent in it, which is very surprising since he had to get his tongue twisted around an awful script.
Never the less, I did enjoy it for a while, but the end was simply crap. It was one of those annoying endings that could be the ending to any film ever made. Which is very annoying because it just felt like whoever wrote couldn't think of an ending so he just pulled this one out.
Rubbish ending. Not particurlarly engaging. If you want to see a really good film, that's set in a motel on the road, then just watch Psycho.
Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho that is, not that crap re-make.",1083715200,,838,4.24375
1842910,1,B00008EY9G,"Man, this is mean. After watching for almost one hour a group of people being slaughtered one by one in a cheap motel during a thunderstorm, we reach the conclusion that the killer can not be one of the four remaining survivor up till this point. And, surprise, it's really not!
Why? Because nothing that happened in the last hour was real! Yes, that's right! All of that was happening inside the mind of highly mentally sick killer, who had ""multiple characters"" inside himself, some of them good, some of them bad and one very bad, a real serial killer. In order to not be executed, the judge must be convinced that the very bad one does not exist anymore.
So, who is the killer is simply not an issue anymore! That's righ! You'll feel like a suck..r after watching the turn of events. And, by that, it will be too late to turn off your DVD, so you'll end up watching it until the end, anyway, while the writers, the actors, the director and the producers will be laughing their ars..s off.",1083542400,7,992,4.426229508196721

But making a wild turn next to the ending of the film, a turn that made clear that all that happened before a lie (or a kind of dream) was inexcusable, absurd, and made me feel like an idiot.

Technically, the movie is very good, and acting is top notch (except by the father of the little guy. Watch his expression of ""disbelief"" when he sees a victim that had a baseball bat stuff into his throat....

The director has done a terrific job especially in the way he introduces the characters which gives us a hint about Schizophrenia on the prowl. He,the director,does not seem to attach much importance to the elements of gore,blood and suspense in the way the victims are being killed. All the killings are done by a schizophrenic individual and the killings are like to an outside individual, as if they are performed under the depths of sea..Am i confusing ?.
Anyway this movie is a treat to those who want to see a good movie not neccassarily a horror movie..",1082764800,,733,4.6461538461538465
1842914,4,B00008EY9G,"Identity is the kind of thriller we haven't seen in a while from Hollywood, the Ten Little Indians scenario where a large group of people are being killed off by an unknown adversary and the suspense level rises until a significant plot twist turns the whole thing on its ear.  That's a good movie and Identity, which the exception of some minor hiccups, lives up to it.
A good ensemble cast, including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, and John C. McGinley, provide adequate amounts of star power and tension.  Director James Mangold has proven he can handle this type of material and cast as the director of Copland.  In this film he takes a limited location, sets his characters up well, and more or less lets things unfold as they will without forcing the issue.
The one problem is this - if you remember the commercials for the film that ran on television when it opened, they revealed a very important plot device that doesn't give away the big revelation, but comes damn close.  In addition, if you are really paying attention, it's not all that hard to guess what it is.  This isn't to say that it takes anything away from the film at all.  It's very clever and certainly holds your interest for the duration.  An argument could also be made that the ending feels tacked on, but at 90 minutes, there's no wasted scenes or extemperaneous dialogue.  The DVD does come with an extended version, as well as commentary from Mangold.
An excellent popcorn thriller.",1082764800,2,1488,4.674329501915709
1842915,5,B00008EY9G,"Truly this is what I call a nice movie. It kept me in suspense from the first minute to the last. For some reasons I didn't want it to end. It had a couple of shadows from the famous Hitchcocks ""Psycho"" but that only made this movie better.
Anyways, in one small area so many killings happen within a short time and in all of them John Cusack is somehow involved but at the same time he's the only one who is passionately trying to find a mysterious serial killer. But that's difficult. Not even you as the audience can not help him find the killer.
When I watched this movie for the first time - we were about 6 people in the dark room. We've all been silent and totally concentrated on the movie. We've all labeled individually a couple of great actors/actresses as potential killers. None of them turned up to be a killer in the end - a fact which left us astounded.
So please Watch this movie - and see it for yourself who's this mysterious killer.

1842917,1,B00008EY9G,"In ""Adventures In The Screen Trade"" Bill Goldman tells a story about the moment in ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" where the audience turned on the film, and began to hate it. Once a film loses an audience in a way that makes them hostile, it's impossible to get them back. And so it was with me, and ""Identity"".
Without giving away spoilers it's a little hard for me to describe exactly what it is about this movie that I disliked so intensely, but at its heart my problem is with the central contrivance of the script, which becomes apparent about 20 minutes into the film. The film asks the viewer to speculate on what might or might not be real. The problem with this as a plot device is: if it's not real, do I care what's going on? Superior writers manage to overcome this (for example, Charlie Kaufmann does a pretty bang-up job most of the time with completely unreal scenarios, but it doesn't matter because the purpose of the unreality is to focus the viewer on something else that's important, although he likewise came unstuck in the third act of ""Adaptation"" for the same reasons). The problem in ""Identity"" is that the script revolves around trickery that ultimately serves no purpose. If nothing is as it seems, and the characters aren't particularly likeable, and none of this is going toward any larger view, what the heck is the point? ""Identity"" becomes a very irritating exercise in style. Unfortunately it's not that stylish.
The cast can't be faulted - all excellent. And the direction is fine. What a pity the script is so awful. I truly loathed this film.",1082073600,6,1572,4.617857142857143

1842919,5,B00008EY9G,"Identity is one of my favorite movies of recent time. I remember it fondly when I went to see in the theaters and left there absolutely shocked, but in a good way I was so surprised at what I had just seen. Now this movie is not for everyone, if your idea of thrills come from say Friday the 13th where it's just slash and kill slash and kill then Identity is probably not for you (not that there is anything wrong with slasher flicks of course) Identity is a psychological thrillers where you have to pay attention for almost the entire movie or you are going to be clueless as to what is going on, I think a comparison can be drawn to the movie Se7en, you have to pay attention. The movie drew me in right from the start and never let go.
Story: A group of different people wind up at a run down motel in rainstorm and eventually people start dying. There doesn't appear to be any link to the strangers until they find out that they all have a common link John Cusak is really good in his role and I found a new bit of respect for Amanda Peet, she was also rather entertaining to watch. The director (James Mangol) makes sure that you never really get a chance to relax, he makes sure something is happening the entire movie, that is in my opinion what truly keeps your entertained.
The ending is definitely a weird one but if you keep on paying attention then it will make sense if you truly think about it. A lot of people were complaining about the ending but I liked it, something new and refreshing. I can truly recommend this movie and suggest that you pick it up if you get a chance.",1081987200,,1592,4.205882352941177

UTTER NONSENSE, April 8, 2004
Reviewer: A viewer from poplarville, ms United States
""This movie is confusing, unbelievable and trite.""
yes, the movie is confusing...but confusing in the ""fight club"" way...in ""the matrix"" way...in ""the sixth sense"" way...even in the ""alice in wonderland"" way. it's the kind of movie that's confusing until the end, but then makes perfect sense if you've been paying attention...the kind of movie that has to be watched at least twice - the first time you watch it, you watch it to understand the movie and get the premise and the second time you watch it, you watch it with your new knowledge (new knowledge such as who tyler durden really is, what the matrix is, what the sixth sense is, why alice saw the things that she did) to pick up on the details we couldn't see before.
""The first 100 minutes of the film you can skip. It transpires that all the mayhem, and blood-letting, unconvincing, at the hotel really didn't happen!""
after finding out that all these ""strangers"" are just different personalities of the psychotic killer, ""all the mayhem and blood-letting"" takes on a whole new meaning. we see how every ""murder"" gets rid of one of his personalities. we understand why it's so important to kill the killer - if the killer wins, that personality will dominate malcolm rivers and he will remain a murderer.
""It was all imagined by this chap about to be executed for multiple murders.""
""imagine"" is such a bad word to use for what goes through malcolm rivers' head -he has several different personalities and they are forced to ""meet"" each other (in his mind) when his psychiatrist gives him a certain treatment.
""He convinces those taking him o the xecution area, as well as the legal and psychiatric authorities, that he is no longer a danger since now he oly imagines bad things.""
this is incorrect - they don't consider him a danger anymore because they believed that the killer personality was killed by another personality, edward.
""Maybe he didn't take his medication that day, but on the way to the prison for the criminally insane he murders everyone in the car, and shortly thereafterwards sends one of his manifest identities, a young boy, to strangle an attractive girl her Florida garden. Apparently, the screenweriter was not satisfied with imaginary characters buried in the synopses of the psychotic killer, but with a Stephen King-like enthusiasm, made it possible for the killer to created these personalities in flesh and blood. I don't think this is clininically possible, and I have poured over the DSM -I-IV, of the AMA.If there were such an entity, it would certainly be a challenge to treat.""
this is the biggest mistake in this review - the young boy and former escort don't come to life in ""flesh and blood""...all this happens in the killer's mind - another twist to the ending. everyone thought that the child timothy died in the car explosion and that the former escort was the only survivor, but this is not the case. as we watch the woman in her orange grove in florida (in malcolm rivers mind), it seems as though everything is fine now, but timothy comes back and reveals himself as the true killer. he kills the woman and now he is the only personality inside of malcolm's head. because of that internal battle, malcolm reverts back to killer mode and murders his psychiatrist and the driver.
""Since all that happened at the hotel was imaginary, I don't feel that I should have to describe that action.""
why not? the hotel was the battlefield in his mind. we see the personalities struggling to survive and this is one of the most heart wrenching parts to watch. the viewer doesn't want the different personalities to die (well...some of them) because we've gotten to know them...BUT we want malcolm to mentally triumph and become just one person, so we're torn.
""I will say this, altough I'm sure such a nuance point was not in the mind of the director or screenwriter, he lack of plot, craziness, inconsistencies, symbol objects such as a key,the curious amount of rain in Nevada, killings, does point to the imaginary ramblings of psychotic killer.""
of course it was in their mind. that was the whole point - all of those little things tells you something is not quite right with the scenario. everyone's birthday is on may 10th, everyone's last name is a state name...the viewer is thrown off and believes that some preternatural powers, possibly from the indian burial ground, brought all those ppl together for some purpose. when we find out that those ppl are actually the same person, the viewer has the epiphany, ""ahhh...now it all makes sense.""
with all that said, i highly recommend the movie. it takes you inside the mind of a schizophrenic killer in the most interesting way...while it doesn't excuse his actions, it evokes feelings of sympathy and pity from the viewer because we see that this man wasn't truly a bad man (we see this especially with the personality edward)...his schizophrenia was caused by something out of his control. while the movie wasn't hugely successful (i think, in part, because it was marketed wrong), it's meant to be a cult classic like fight club or the professional.",1081900800,,5218,4.7988888888888885

Identity offered up more then it could handle. Dont get me wrong, I do own this movie and I find it an enjoyable watch every so often, I just believe that it is not unlike the recent trend of thriller/who-done-it movies that have grown increasingly popular throughout the recent years.

The major annoyance I have with the film is a slight but critical blunder.  I'm used to Hollywood getting psychological diagnosis wrong.  Hollywood often plays with diagnostics for dramatic purposes.  This blunder was not an error for dramatic effect.  It was just a stupid error that should have been corrected.

1842929,5,B00008EY9G,"Ever see Memento?
Identity's like that. It takes place in another person's mind. It's disjointed. It tells the events out of order. The order of the movie's scenes gives insight into what's really happening. And of course, people die and nobody's sure who did it or how.
Identity is not quite as slick as Memento. It's choppy at parts, disjointed or just plain plays dirty pool in others.
10 strangers end up stranded in the rain at a creepy hotel. The laws of their world slowly unravel as they attempt to escape -- cell phones don't work, cars can't cross the flooded roads, and accidents happen that keep them from escaping the area and each other.
There's a lot of interesting characters. There's the cop and the serial killer con he's escorting to an execution. There's the limo driver who was once a cop. There's the hooker with a heart of gold. The couple who just got married because the girl's pregnant. The average family, complete with silent little boy and weird stepdad. The bitchy washed-up actress. And of course, the freaky hotel owner.
Everyone in the movie has a secret. The secrets unravel as things go from bad to worse and each person gets bumped off. Some of the deaths are accidents, some are outright murders. All of them leave the corpse with a hotel key, in the order of each person killed. Things get REALLY weird when the hotel keys starting showing up on corpses that died by accident.
If you haven't figured it out yet, the rest of this review contains a spoiler. It's the only way I can talk about the film with any candor. So kiddies who don't want the ending spoiled for them, leave the room.
Identity takes place in Malcolm Rivers' head. He has 10 personalities in there banging around and Malcolm is about to be executed for murder. Malcolm murdered a bunch of people at a hotel (six victims, I believe), stabbing them to death. But his psychiatrist submits that Malcolm is legally insane and that a new drug treatment will force the personalities to eliminate each other.
The premise of Identity is great. I also figured it out five minutes into the film. If you pay attention, the pictures in the first few minutes of the film -- along with certain phrases said by the patient -- are repeated by characters within the movie. In that respect, Identity is internally consistent. If you know that (and when I was watching this with my brother, he didn't catch it), the rest of the movie falls into place pretty quickly.
I couldn't help but feel the cut scenes involving the psychiatrist broke up the flow. I wanted a real mystery that strung me along and it felt like Identity thought I was too stupid to keep up.
And yet, Identity is definitely an expertly crafted work. There's even a surprise twist -- the dominant personality isn't who you think it is (SURPRISE!) but what's irritating is that while every other twist and turn can be figured out, the final twist simply can't be predicted.
In essence, the movie is internally consistent until it isn't, and I felt a bit betrayed by the way it ended.
On the other hand, the ending is delicious. It's grimly cynical but perfectly poised, a tribute to everything Hitchcockian and ""Ten Little Indians"" (which the film directly references). Identity loses points for not being perfectly consistent, but it's still a damn fine movie.

What goes on inside the mind of a homocidal madman who suffers from delusions and multiple-personality syndrome?  If you are curious as to what any of these answers might be, this movie may be for you.
This is the most well-acted film I have seen in quite awhile.  It has two top-shelf male actors in John Cusack and Ray Liotta and the dynamic they create is splendid to watch.  The lovely and talented Amanda Peet rounds out the big names in the flick.
I can figure out a lot of thrillers right off the bat.  This one, however, really kept me guessing.  You think you know what's going on, but you really don't.  It's told in a bit of a TWILIGHT ZONEesqe style where Rod Serling seems to be hiding behind every corner.
For fans of the thriller / mystery genre, you won't find a better one than this.  It comes in two forms (options on the DVD):  theatrical release & expansion edition.  I would recommend the latter as I don't like it when Hollywood cuts out scenes just for the sake of brevity.

A serial killer is being given a last minute review of his death sentence (insanity plea) even as 10 people find themselves in a motel where they are being killed one by one. The psychiatrist is arguing the serial killers case.  Meanwhile, the people in the motel discover that people are being killed according to their motel room numbers. They are all very different, a soap opera star, a chauffeur, a call girl, a cop, but they all have one thing in common. They were all born on the 10th of may. Who is killing them? One of them? The spirits of Ancient Indians on whose burial ground the hotel is built? The serial killer? Are these people seemingly normal people, or is there something more to them.
If you are a psychological thriller fan, the ending won't surprise you. Afterall, the premise is one of the most popular in this genre of film. However, it has never been protrayed as interestingly. I heard gasps in the theatre as the `truth' was revealed. It won't make you scream, or startle but the plot is very well crafted.

It was very scary, but not because of the normal slasher movie cliches, but because I had no idea what was going to happen next.  The story is pretty much an updated version of Ten little indians, which is a wonderful whodunit in itself.
All of the acting is wonderful.  There is humor just when you need it, but it does not stay around for long.
The story follows 11 people as they are thrust into each others lives with out knowing why.  One by one they are murdered and at each murder a room key is left starting with room 10 and going down to 1.  So it is up to them to first find out who is killing them, second why and third what do they all have in common.  The movie cuts back and forth between the motel where the murders are taking place and a courthouse where there is a midnight meeting going on about what is going to happen to a convicted killer.
The pace is pretty quick and there is not much downtime.  Once you think you have figured it out a screwdriver is thrown into the spokes of your wheel and you are left right back at the beginning to start over.

'JASON' or 'FREDDY' movie. It suspends reality and draws you
into it's dark, ever changing web as you try to guess who the
killer really is. There is a huge and wonderfully unique twist
coming. I will not give it away here, but I must warn you, some

very well acted, John Cusack is very good in the lead role, and
Ray Liotta gives the best performance I've seen out of him in a

When it's all in the guy's head, the it-was-all-a-dream ending is a major cop-out. No wonder we couldn't figure it out, joke's on us!

1842937,2,B00008EY9G,"A tip to filmmakers for future reference: don't pull wool over the audience's eyes unless you've got something really good to show them when you pull it off again. Identity tries its best: it jumps through all the familiar slasher genre hoops (rainswept motel, escaped murderer, mismatched bunch of strangers dropping like flies the minute they're left alone) before attempting a multiple backflip-into-somersault manouevre two thirds of the way in. ""Mulholland Drive, Mulholland Drive,"" it whispers to itself as a confidence-booster, only to lose its footing, stumble wildly and fall flat. On. Its. Face.
The problem is that Identity isn't nearly as smart as it so desperately wants to be - its ace card is certainly unexpected, but it's a plot volte face that adds nothing to the proceedings beyond turning them on their head. It's not particularly clever, either - certainly not enough to redeem the rest of the movie (which is, for the record, watchable without being in the slightest bit memorable). Had the makers of Identity given the psychological wig-out aspect of their movie a little more thought, they might have ended-up with a minor classic on their hands. Had they made the slasher element a bit less predictable, they could have gotten away with eschewing the hallowed twist altogether. As it is, they've left us with a depressing hotch-potch, a whole that's nothing more than the sum of its parts.",1077753600,6,1414,5.047008547008547

Director James Mangold, of ""Girl, Interrupted"" fame, does a fine job of setting the tone and mood with the scene.  It all has a neo-film noir nuance about it, with a neon-lit motel sign watching above a rainy and watery shadowed scene of a Bates-like Psycho lodging house from hell, where ten characters are trapped through loosely connected circumstances in an island of intrigue and mystery.  A perfect storm of weather and serendipity has left them stuck together trying to figure out who is doing it (murdering them off one by one) before their own numbers are up.  It is somehow tied into a convicted death row inmate up for consideration of a 24 hour prior reprieve, played creepily brilliant by Pruitt Taylor Vince.  The twist and turns that lead up to a horrifying ending will not disappoint.
Granted an experienced film and literary buff will probably be able to pick out familiar threads and elements of Agatha Christie, Psycho, and Sybil, but I'm not knocking the screenplay for revealing the inspiration for such an deliciously spooky murder mystery.
See for yourself.  Identify an edge of your seat thinking person's thriller in ""Identity.""

1842939,4,B00008EY9G,"This movie is very entertaining, even if you don't quite understand it. There are two storylines going on that are related to each other somehow and could leave a viewer confused at the end. However, the movie gets much better with repeat watches after you begin to understand it. There is a definite twist in this movie and I had to watch it two more times myself to fully understand what really happened. So if you don't get it the first time, watch it a few more times around and really pay attention before you judge this film.
I would also like to point out the beautiful setting the director and crew created with the darkness, water, and the creepy motel, and the mysterious atmosphere that was made that caused the characters to clash with one another. I wish the movie was a bit longer, though, because it felt like some of the characters weren't developed enough (hence the four stars). I really didn't care about some of the characters. But each personality was well done for each character and very distinct, some just needed more screentime.
Also, this movie was more like a mystery instead of a horror because I wasn't really scared. Instead, this movie really makes you think- about who the murderer is, who this mental patient is, and how he relates to all the murders. There are a few jumps, however, and enough suspense and action to keep viewers far from being bored. Also, the movie ends in a freaky way (that's where I was scared the most, however).

1842940,3,B00008EY9G,"The big problem with reviews of ""Identity"" is that some people seem to want to blithely give away the big twist in the movie, which partially spoils it for viewers. After all, figuring out why all of these people are stuck at a rained-in motel in the middle of nowhere, and who is killing them and why, is the main focus of the film.
Much like ""The Sixth Sense"" - with which it shares high production values and a desire to be more than just a thriller - once the audience has determined the twist - which some audience members may do as soon as the opening credits, or even from the trailer - the film loses a lot of its tension and has to be carried by the strength of its execution.
In the case of ""Identity,"" this means watching a relatively strong cast acting out somewhat underwritten parts, but for the most part, they ably rise to the challenge. John Cusack does an excellent job as always, although this part is both more serious and darker than his usual fare. More interestingly, Amanda Peet gets the chance to stretch her wings, never having had an opportunity to play more than just an object of desire in a motion picture, and she does extremely well, showing that she's capable of much more with future parts.

1842943,5,B00008EY9G,"I think there are two basic types of movie watchers. The first goes into each film trying to figure it out. That's the whole goal. If they succeed, then the movie is ""predictable"" and ""stupid"". If not, then the ""plot made no sense"" or ""whole thing was just so boring"" and other comments. No way to win.
The second type of movie watcher sees the film to enjoy the movie and does not make guessing the twists or the endings the whole goal. This is me. Because of this, I was truly able to enjoy ""Identity"", especially when the story took its turn.
You see, anyone remotely familiar with great stories in the last hundred years has heard of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" where one by one people die at the hand of some unknown killer on site, since leaving the scene is impossible. The killer must be one of them. For the first hour, this appears to be a retread of this classic tale.
At this point in the movie, either you are in category 1 and you hate the film, or you are in category 2 and you love it because it will challenge you and it will hit you hard. Even if you are able to see the surprise coming, you have to admit that looking through the story it does not cheat. It stays faithful to the parameters it has set and that's all you can ask.
Yes, the acting is good and the screenplay is well executed and editing and all that, but this film does not depend on the actors. It works well as fiction and I think you could have replaced the actors with other capable performers and not lost much. Very few people I have spoken with have been real concerned with Cusack's or Liotta's performances.
I will admit that the very end seems a little tacked on. Hollywood seems to have a formula they have to follow and one is an ending like this one. It works, but it is unnecessary. The movie actually twists twice and it does not have to.
Just look at the comments throughout these reviews. Most are either love or hate. I think some people get mad when movies put one over on them... not me!

John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea DuVall all meet at a small Motel along with a man, his kid, and his wife who had a terrible accident to her neck.  Ray Liotta was a cop transferring a prisoner to Carson City, Nevada.  While he left him tied up somewhere, he along with John Cusack's actress he was driving (Cusack plays a limo driver and use to be a cop), gets murdered and more bodies turn up one-by-one (Your average ""who done it?"" type of thriller).  I liked how they kept it at a Motel because it keeps the location small and you don't have to be thinking elsewhere (if you know what I mean).  When the murders started to happen, you would think that it could've been one of THEM who commited these (Ray Liotta was always one of those suspicious characters and he was a tad creepy in some of the beginning scenes with him).  What makes this movie fit the title (Identity), is that all the characters in the movie share something that they never knew about and took them by surprise.  They all have the same birth date and they were all off to the some destination when they turned in at the Motel.  Liotta and Cusack deliver top-mark performances while they try to figure out what's going on.  Amanda Peet who was in The Whole Nine Yards also impressed me when I saw her acting.

I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric,  and intriguing  thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy  motel in the middle of nowhere.
There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently  a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that  opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues.
There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, ""Gotcha!"".
This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy.

1842949,2,B00008EY9G,"This is really a mess.  One wonders how such movies get made.  James Mangold, who was off to such fine start in his directorial career with the critically acclaimed Heavy (1995) and the superior psychodrama Girl, Interrupted (1999), and even the slightly offbeat but intriguing Cop Land (1997), really loses it here with this bizarro attempt at something like Psycho and David and Lisa meet Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians.""
The premise is ridiculous and the resolution just plain silly.  Without revealing anything (the denouement of the obtuse plot being perhaps the only thing that might keep the thumb of most intelligent viewers over the age of, say, fourteen, off the stop button) let me say that when it's over you just might feel cheated.
John Cusack stars as an ex-cop, now a chauffeur, who can suture wounds.  The scene is the Nevada/California desert during a savage downpour that traps ten (+1) people at an isolated motel where bloody mayhem of the most inexplicable sort ensues as one by one the guests turn up dead.  The action consists of wet people screaming and staring with horror at such sights as a dead man with a baseball bat shoved three-quarters of the way down his throat, etc.  They insult each other a lot.  Prostitutes don't like cops; little guys who never got any, hate prostitutes, and the little boy doesn't really love his mommy, etc.  As the coincidences pile up (as the motel proprietor remarked, with the odds against being ""trillions to one"") we begin to realize that either something supernatural is going on or...  You guessed it.  It's all a....
But I can't say.  We do get a hint of how everything will turn out when Mangold flash-forwards to a group of shrinks and other interested parties who are holding a kind of seance around what seems to be John Cusack's character.
Anyway, even the acting is not that good with the usually very fine Cusack seemingly infected by the deficiencies of the other players, or the stupidities of the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold.  (I don't think the actors wanted too many takes in all that water, and it shows.)  At any rate if you want to see a little kid and some mediocre actors overact or a lot of people deadpan the horror their eyes spy while barking at each other or you just like seeing Hollywood players have to make a living while wet, go for it.

If you are a total stranger to the genre, you might not notice it, but this idea is clearly borrowed from Agatha Christie novels.  But ""Identity"" gives an unexpected twist ... which is provided by the 11th character.  That is a crucial point, but some of you will detect the plot device, one of the pivotical point of ""Identity,"" in the middle of the story.  If so, just keep on watching, because another big surprise is waiting for you.
And that is also the weakness of the film, too.  As the plot unravels, the mysterious atmosphere gets thinner.  That is inevitable, considering the nature of the film.  Still, if you see the opening of the film which has a tense, sinister feeling all around, you might well regret the loss of it.
Director James Mangold's foray into thriller is pretty successful, even though what he does is actually recycled from old classic films of the genre.  But he does it very competently, and it is certain that you get thrills especially from the first part of the film.
But the most memorable contribution to ""Identity"" is done from its production designer Mark Friedberg and its photographer Phedon Papamichael.  And like his previous ""Girl, Interrupted,"" James Mangold is endowed with talented cast.

As a thriller, it's great and as a thriller with a twist it's one of the most original to come around in a long time.  IDENTITY revolves around 10 people who all become stranded at the same creepy motel on a dark and story night. Somehow contected to all of this is the hearing concerning a bald-headed mass murderer. This hearing doesn't come into play much, but has a very important connection to the rest of the movie.  Anyway, back at the ranch, I mean, hotel.  One by one the people at the hotel start dieing. Everyone becomes suspicious of everyone else until no one has a clue to what's going on.  Things get wierder and wierder until the film's climax and all the loose ends are tied up.  However, even then things aren't what they seem to be.  IDENTITY is an interesting movie.

1842964,4,B00008EY9G,"Identity (James Mangold, 2003)
See this movie. See it now. Spend the film wondering how director James Mangold (who did manage to make one very good film previous to this in Cop Land, but has otherwise foisted such tripe upon the viewing public as Girl, Interrupted and Heavy) and screenwriter Michael Cooney (he wrote a script for Jack Frost 2: Return of the mutant Killer Snowman. Need I say more?) managed to put together such a startling, refreshing piece of filmmaking as this.
Ten strangers are stranded in the Nevada desert during a rainstorm. They start dying. As the deaths get more and more incongruous, the survivors begin to turn on one another. It's a very thin plot... or it would be without a twist that is, quite simply, completely different than anything you've ever seen in a thriller. It's a plot twist that ranks right up there with Fight Club, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, `Salem's Lot (the book, not the movie), fill in whatever you want that left your jaw hanging open. The setup is brilliant, the payoff even more so.
Much of the credit here is due to a stellar cast, headed by John Cusack (Max, Being John Malkovich), who has turned his eighties teen stardom into one of the best-managed careers in Hollywood today. His foil is played by Ray Liotta (Narc, Cop Land). Others at the hotel are John C. McGinley (Scrubs, Intensity), Amanda Peet (Igby Goes Down), John Hawkes (From Dusk Til Dawn, Playing God), Jake Busey (The Frighteners)... you get the idea. High-powered cast. Everyone has perfect timing throughout. Expect much; you'll get it.
Easily one of the best films of the year, if not the best. A must for any fan of intelligent thrillers, horror films, graveyard humor, John Cusack... oh, forget it. It's a must for everybody. **** ",1070236800,,1772,4.753246753246753
1842965,3,B00008EY9G,"This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film.  Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night.  One by one they are getting murdered.  It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters.  There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.
John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop.  Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner.  There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word.  There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.
But this is not a usual ""whodunit"".  No way.  The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed.  To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.

It has a good ending, which is where it parallels to the ending of THE HOURS, is abrupt to the plot and yet acceptable to the audience.  The child shows the audience the nature of the killer, the fact that he would kill anyone even his own mother.  This also shows the relavance if his poem.  When first heard, you can tell that it is a childish poem and it acts as a kind of clue as to who the murderer is.  This was very thoughtful of the writers and intuitive the fact that audiences don't look for things like that and that they like it when everything makes seince in the end, which is what is accomplished in the van.

1842971,5,B00008EY9G,"Just think of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Negroes, Hitchcock's Psycho,and add Raising Cain to the mould and what you get is one of the most intelligent suspense thrillers I have seen in a long while, with a twist at the end that will truly shock you.
However these comparisons are more related to the mood, setting and atmosphere of the film rather than the content or style ,for James Mangold (Girls Interrupted, Copland) manages to direct  Michael Cooney's original script with his own undeniable touch.
I will not write a lot about the story of the film, since it is the kind that the viewer should watch with a degree of ignorance in order to discover it all by him/herself, and any hints might very well ruin the explosive end:
Save to say that during a violent storm a group of people become stranded in a remote motel,and soon enough they start dropping dead one by one in mysterious and sinister circumstances. Of course, nothing is really what it seems, and there lies a secret behind these deaths that unless you are a brightest of your local Mensa group,it will come totally unexpected.(Thank God I am not, and the ending blew my mind)
Mangold is an able director, and he manages successfully to create the right mood for his film from the very start and keep the suspense till the very end, with the help of spot on editing.
One aspect of Cooney's script which I found very well covered, is the fact that despite the relatively large number of characters in the film,each one (in varying degress of course), gets enough treatment to make him/her much more interesting.(Suspense/horror thrillers with many characters tend to emphasize more on two or three characters,leaving the rest not more than extras.)
The casting was made of fine actors such as John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Rebecca De Mornay. But, personally watching any film, I largely expect the big stars to deliver their end of the bargain flawlessly,and some names are enough to attract the viewers regardless of the genre, yet I love to discover the little relatively unknown supporting actors and actresses who give a performance as good if not better as their star colleagues. And surely enough, in Identity, I was greatly impressed by the performance of Pruitt Taylor Vince, notwithstanding his relatively short time on screen. He was the best thing in the average Trapped and yet again he proves that he is an actor of immense capabilities.
So if you want an intelligent suspense film, with a great script, direction and acting, a movie that you will think about long after the credits roll, then look no further, for Identity is such a film, a valuable addition to your movie library.",1069545600,,2663,4.776572668112799

I haven't known before that IDENTITY may have taken reference from a story by Agatha Christie called (Ten Little Indians) until I have read that in one of the British movie magazines , But that doesn't mean that this IDENTITY is limited to the usual boundaries of ordinary thrillers ,It just took the primal concept from the books where the same events of completely unrelated characters are gathered in one place and after that the serial killings begins ,And after that the story took flight in a whole new lands of imagination ,And in my opinion this is the first strength point of IDENTITY .
The movie succeeded in creating a terrifying atmosphere with using of rain and darkness to give the viewers the feel of trapness of the characters gathered there ,The plot seemed to fly from a point to another without stopping ,Things are revealed and relations are formed but thankfully in unstereotypical method ,The Screenplay written by Michael Cooney gave every character almost an equal share of the screen time depends on the situation and the events paths ,And didn't represent any insignificant character so you have your concerns about all of them ,And Director James Mangold was very good in controlling such brilliant actors like Ray Liotta and John Cusack who both delivered a top notch performance especially from cusack who was very indulged in his role to the maximum degree .
IDENTITY doesn't give you a chance to nod off ,It totally grips you from the first moments ,And the most important Excellency feature is that the ability to create twists without giving the viewer any feeling that the represented twist was put there intentional just to satisfy the viewers hungry for a plot's twist in every thriller they see ,Actually The main twist in the third third of the movie into higher land ,And was a good model for what should the twists made ,It completely blows your expectations away ,And it really gave this movie a very creepy feeling .

There's a Full-Screen (1.33:1) version of the film included here as well.  But ""Widescreen"" is definitely the superior format for this (or any other) motion picture.
With an ample supply of twists and turns to keep us guessing, this film (although featuring its fair share of lifeless bodies along the way) rises well above the ""slasher"" film mentality, providing the viewer with a perfectly reasonable--and realistic--explanation to the events we're seeing on the screen.
John Cusack is rock-solid here as a former cop who gets more than he bargained for during a seemingly-routine trip to California.
The movie-makers have done a more-than-adequate job of character development for this film. Not an easy task, either, considering we're introduced to more than your average number of principal players (numbering in double digits).

The viewer thinks they know what is going on as a collection of characters find themselves stuck at a small motel in a dreadful downpour.  Other scenes concern a mass-murderer who is getting a last-minute hearing.  The prisoner is en-route to the hearing.  But by paying attention we know that what the film wants us to think is far from true.
In Agatha Christie fashion, the people in the motel begin to be murdered.  Tensions and suspicions mount.  A new arrival at the hearing substantiates the earlier clues and derails the average viewer's ideas of what is going on.
Finally we get to the end where we resolve the relationship between the characters, the motel, the hearing and just what is going on.  No real surprise thanks to the blatant clues.  But even that hinges on believing a ""new treatment"" is possible without any explanation as to how it was done especially when it is the impossibility of said treatment that causes the dysfunction in the first place.

Other actors in the cast are good too. Director James Mangold keeps things moving with no room for draggy spots and each character has secrets---their own ""baggage"" so to speak.

Different people get caught up in a flash storm only to end up in a motel where they start getting bumped off one by one. The story is very interesting, fast, with lots and lots of plot twists along the way but it all falls to pieces in the end with what the filmmakers probably thought was a unique and original twist-type-premise for the whole film. It sadly is not and even the final scene is like something out of Scream VII.

1842988,5,B00008EY9G,"Through the years, we have had some really unique, well-done and chilling movies that have become classics in this genre:  ""Psycho,"" ""The List of Adrian Messenger,"" ""Ten Little Indians,"" ""Frailty"" and now this wonderfully constructed mystery that combines elements of all of these and more, and yet manages to come off as quite a unique shocker in its own manipulative way.  Take your stock ten characters, place them in a motel (hmm???), an awful storm and then before you know, one by one....yes, they're picked off.  But note some of the eerie clues director Mangold posits:  why does the room number on room 6 becoming 9 important: what's that on Ray Liotta's shirt?  What are the scenes with Alfred Molina all about; nothing is as it seems in this movie and that's what makes it so much fun.  John Cusack is brilliant in his role as the cop turned chauffeur; Rebecca De Mornay does for this role what Janet Leigh did for ""Psycho"" and Angie Dickinson for ""Dressed to Kill.""  Ray Liotta is also effective in his law enforcing role; Amanda Peet is both beautiful and impressive as the hooker going to start her own lime/orange farm.  Little Bret Roehr as Timmy is also eerily effective.  Only John McGinley who takes George a little over the top seems out of place and that's not a drawback, just one of those little petty things we have to complain about?
I loved the feel of this movie; the rain, the general ""staginess"" of the motel itself; De Mornay's love affair with her cell phone.

The movie is about a group of strangers who all get stranded at the same motel together because of a flood - one of the people just so happens to be a muderer being transferred by a cop to another prison. Murders start happening and everyone points their finger at the convict - until HE gets murdered. Then everyone turns frantic tring to figure out who the real murderer is.

I had high hopes.  And I wasn't disappointed! (It didn't hurt anything that Jake Busey had a role, either...)
IDENTITY is a movie unto itself.  It's not the greatest phsycological suspense movie ever made (Hitchock probably had a hand in that movie) but it's pretty damn good.
Okay, here's the plot: ten strangers wind up, by chance (or so it seems) at a motel in the middle of nowhere, on a night filled with rain, thunder, lightning, and all the rest of that suspensful stuff.  Among them are: a limo-driver (Cusack) and his employer; a prostitute (Peet) heading home for Florida; a man, his stepchild, and his wife (who's involved in an accident before she reaches the hotel); a young newlywed couple; and a cop (Liotta) escorting an inmate (Busey).  Also thrown into the mix is the manager of the hotel who, while no Bates, possesses an air of innocent mystery.
Everything, while not alright, is certainly not dangerous...until the convict escapes, and the killings begin.
But there is a question that plagues the occupants of the hotel: is the convict really the killer?  And if not him...then who?
Trust me, ladies and gents--despite what you think, you'll not be able to predict the ending of this awesome, creepy, thought-provking, and downright enjoyable movie.  The ending is, indeed, what I would consider to be a classic--I just wish I could tell you more, but I can't.
In this movie, no one--and I mean no one, ladies and gents--is who they seem to be.  And that's what makes this movie--much more than a glorified ""who-dunit"", in case that's what you were thinking--so suspensful and exciting.
IDENTITY is a rarity: a movie for adults (don't go into this expecting a simple, Barney-esque plot) that gives its viewers a childish glee.  A must-see!  I mean it.",1066003200,5,1929,4.80060422960725

  as for the dvd features, well, there is some deleted scenes while interesting are not mindblowing.  there is a good documentary that was aired on stars, storyboard comparisons, and the trailer.  the widescreen version has an alternate ending which is very cool.  all in all a  great movie that really plays with reality and time well while delivering not only a great story but has some excellent details and some great sub-plots all ending in a worthwhile trip.",1066003200,,1294,4.38655462184874
1842994,2,B00008EY9G,"""Identity"" is definitely no ""Psycho"" - not even close, although it does have the motel and psychopathic killer(s). There is more missing in this film than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliance. I had great expectations, especially after the movie's excellent beginning. Creepy opening shots of a criminal mug shot, bizarre childlike drawings, photographs of female murder victims, with voice-overs of a psychiatrist interviewing a very disturbed person, backed by eerie music and a very strange poem, all seemed promising.
Then...on a stormy night in the Nevada desert a group of people, stranded by the flooded highway and surrounding roads, converge on a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. (sound familiar?) There's Ed (John Cusack), an ex-cop turned limo driver from LA, and his has-been actress passenger (Rebecca DeMornay); a Mom, Pop and kid who have much more than road problems; a gorgeous hooker; a recently married couple; a very sinister motel owner; and a cop, (Ray Liotta), accompanying a dangerous convict in chains. My initial feeling that the film was doomed was when I noticed that the convict was a cross between Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein. He is ugly, yes, but too funny looking to be really scary. Then I noticed that 3 of the 4 women were all stunning, sexy, wore miniskirts and showed lots of clevage...more credibility lost. I may sound picky, but if the film is really scary, then one doesn't notice these things.
Anyway, to cut to the chase, the murders begin, and just like in the film ""And Then There Were None,"" the motel guests are knocked off one by one, in descending order of their room numbers, with their keys placed next to the bodies. It soon becomes clear that every possible suspect is being eliminated. So, who is the murderer?? This is when a major plot twist kicks in, but even with the new turn of events the film does not become more credible, nor do the characters.
The plot is hackneyed, even with the 21st century rewrite and surprise ending - most of this has been done before, many times. The dialogue is inane, peppered with four-letter words, although there are a few quips by the motel owner that are kind of funny. He is asked to guard the convict who has just been recaptured after a very violent escape. He says, ""I don't know if I feel comfortable with guard duty, per se."" That's as good as it gets. The characters are flat - absolutely no depth. Now some may say there's a reason for this, and there may be. However one still has to sit through an entire film watching cardboard characters running aimlessly around in the pouring rain, mouthing inane dialogue - just to see an unusual ending. This does not make for an entertaining film.
The premise is good. But good premises do not always make good movies. This one's a loser. You may get a few scares during the film's run time, but you might leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. I sure did.

Identity tells the story of 10 strangers stuck in a motel.  One by one these strangers are slowly being murdered.  Now the survivors must unravel the clues to what brought them all together, who the killer is, and the connection they all share.
A great mystery suspense thriller.  I love it when a movie puts in a taste of mystery in its storyline, and this film is nothing short of mysteries.  The twist and turns, and complete 360's of this movie can only be compared to a Six Flags roller coaster ride.  This movie brilliantly also tries to give hints through out its course, making the viewers go ""Ohhhhhh, I see..."" especially the second time through.  The title of the movie is a big clue in itself.  Definitely worth seeing twice, especially the extended version of this film which comes in the DVD version.  The ending was probably one of the more intelligent/brilliant endings I've ever seen, and really have to be appreciated.  There was also a little bit of Pulp Fiction-esque cinematography, especially in the beggining, which was done nicely.

While many movies follow a simple plot that repeats itself time and time again, this movie goes it's own way.  I was really in the dark as to what was going on until the very end.

I'm a big mystery/suspense fan, and this was really one of the better movies in the genre to come along in quite awhile.  Well acted, interesting characters, good dialogue ... there's a lot of positives here.
But man oh man, the ending would have been CLASSIC had the writer and the director just trusted themselves and not given away the plot twist halfway through the movie.
A couple of extra snips in the editing room would have detracted from one character (I'm trying not to give away anything), and allowed the audience to identify more with the ten stranded hotel guests, as they should have been, experiencing the same paranoia and confusion they felt.  It's really kind of a shame, they had so much positive momentum going and they just popped the cork on the whole thing WAY too early ...",1065571200,2,1003,4.58659217877095
1843000,4,B00008EY9G,"This movie was well done by director James Mangold. It gives you more action than ""A Beautiful Mind"". The main difference in this movie and that movie is that the character the story is centered around is not realistic. Most schizophrenic adults look like normal people not some crazed, twitchy, bugged-eyed psycho killer. That's one knock against the movie. However, the rest of the movie is extremely intriguing. You have to prepare yourself for the beginning, because the movie uses a lot of flashbacks to explain what's going on in that particular scene.
All ten characters are driving out in the middle of nowhere, when this hellacious rainstorm makes their travel impossible. You meet the first couple George and Alice York (John C. McGinley & Leila Kenzle) and their son, Timmy (Bret Loehr). Alice has been hit by a car, which is driven by Ed (John Cusack) who is ferrying a cranky, loquacious movie star  (Rebecca De Mornay)-nice comeback. Alice's carotid artery has been sliced and she is near death, but they can't get to a hospital. They check into this run-down hotel in the middle of nowhere that's run by Larry(John Hawkes)-who has a past of his own. Soon, the torrential downpour brings in a hooker (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple married for all the wrong reasons and a Nevada cop-(is he or isn't he?)-(Ray Liotta) who is transporting a killer (Jake Busey). My question is why does the cop have a hole in his shirt? Anyway, the prisoner is chained to a toilet, but soon escapes and then the murders start happening.
This movie is more of a suspense thriller than a horror movie, but you know that there is more gruesomeness coming as each minute goes by. Where is the killer? Why is the kid so deathly silent? Why is Larry so jumpy? Why is everybody dying and no one knows why? Are the murder victims linked to each other in some crazy way?
While all of this is going on the plight of crazed serial killer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is being decided in Carson City, Nevada. Malcolm's doctor (Alfred Molina) is trying to plead insanity based on new psychological evidence. I'm not going to tell anymore than what I've just mentioned.
The characters were played exceptionally well by this great cast of actors. John Cusack was great in being the leader of the gang. Rebecca DeMornay was convincing in her PMS, primadonna mode. Ray Liotta is always convincing in the roles that he plays.
The fun part of the movie is figuring out who will die next and why are they dying and what brought them to this rundown hotel. Was it coincidence or was it fate? It gets a little sloppy at the end, but all in all this is a good thriller. I'm still trying to figure out some parts of it. I'll probably watch it again. Yep, it's one of those movies.

The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and obviously Sixth Sense told you the ending, then re-explained it. Without it you'd go ""what the hell? why is he all of a sudden....?"". Well this movie does a good job of explaining, and brings in some fine acting.
The movie starts with a hearing of Malcolm Rivers, a convicted killer one day away from execution where the defense has new evidence which could possibly save him. On the other side, 11 people are stranded in a motel during a huge storm. One by one, they start dying and it's up to survivors to figure out who done it, especially when strange occurences start to happen.
John Cusack gives a great performance, I don't really care for Amanda Peet as a whole so I'm biased, Ray Liotta as usual plays a big hothead and Rebecca de Mornay plays the classic stuck up actress. Also credit goes to Pruitt Taylor Vince playing Rivers. When the big revelation is revealed near the end, watch Pruitt's facial expression; it's as if he's doubling Ed's reaction to the revelation.

Half way in the film I noticed one thing, then I figured out who did it. Still, the movie has alot of twists, things that project one answer, then something else happens. I guessed a number of theories, and they actually happened. I loved the beggining, then the middle was pretty good. The ending was rather crappy though.
Basically after an accident, some strangers run into each other. A convict with a man show up. I think its relatively easy to guess whos bad and who isn't in the film. The first murder is rather creepy, especially when it is discovered. The movie seems to go in a downward spiral, but is enough to keep you there. Even if the ending is slightly bad, it tells you everything you need to know about the one man.
Best thing about the movie? Details. There are so many details to pick out that will help you solve things. There are alot of things to speculate on also. Especially the introduction with the tape player and newspaper/photo stuff.
Acting? Great. Terrific roles. People did a great job of seeming real. I didn't like high fidelity, well I saw only 30 minutes of it after getting home, my parents didn't really like it though. However, John Cusack does a wonderful job in this, terrific. Every character does pretty great roles. The movie makes me ponder things, stuff that we never think about.
The disc we rented was terrible, kept skipping, but then we ran it again on my PS2 and it worked fine. It is relatively easy to figure out. Still, this movie has a scary atmosphere, some great twists, but all-in-all a bad ending. Like, I just hated it. The movie is basically not happening or something? Or is it? I'll let you speculate on that after you see it, but until then..... not everyone's identity is different.

I also agree with previous reviewers that the ""twist"" was delivered a little too soon, and the ending, at least to me, was no surprise -- pretty much your standard horror film ending. Still, the point of the movie for me wasn't in the way it ended or even in the twist, but in watching the characters interact and eventually begin to figure out what was happening to them.

Suffice it to say what you think is killing these people is not a ghost or monster from the Indian Buriel grounds. No they are in fact intelligent, cunning, insane, and very much alive.

John Cusack and Ray Liota are exceptional and the rest of the cast and very good. The sets are erie and makes one harken back to thrillers like ""Psycho"". The rainy flooding storm that brings a group of travellers to a motel merely starts the chain of events that make you question fate and coincidences.

When you finally realize how all the traveller's will meet and deal with their fate you are shocked and thrilled. When you begin to realize what the motel keys mean and who hasn't been accounted for you may find it a little hard to believe. Even so it is not the personality, but what they are capable of doing you must remember. Then the unravelling of events as they really happened will astound you.

Maybe I'm easier to please, though I don't think so. Occasionally I do find some of the immensely popular movies disappointing but overall I don't think my tastes very from the norm.
I may have had an advantage because I had no expectations. I had not seen any clips or trailers (is that the right term?) and hadn't even heard of it. I just saw numerous copies of it in my local Blockbuster and figured it must be at least popular if not good, so I watched this movie with a clean slate - no preconceived ideas.
Now I won't get involved in how artsy or well directed or how good the acting was or the cinematography or any of the plethora of facets of movie making for which they give awards. To me, what I rate a movie depends strictly on how much I enjoyed the movie. Of course, all elements of movie making would come down to how well I enjoyed the movie but I not going to try and dissect this movie into components and analyze them.
Did I enjoy this Movie? Yes, thank you, In Spades! Five stars worth, so lets talk a little about the movie. I'm going to start with the end.
I'm positive, even the most vociferous detractor of this movie did not guess the end of Identity. I can tell you, it came out of left field and was a total surprise. Perhaps one of the all time most surprising endings.
Setting
Identity was pretty much set in central Nevada at a run down Motel in a chronic rainstorm. When it wasn't set at the Motel it would flash to an eleventh hour appeal meeting for a convicted multiple slasher/killer, between the Governor and defending and prosecuting, counsel. The purpose for this is at first unclear and I'm going to leave it that way.
Plot
Several travelers get stranded because of the weather and are forced to check into a remote motel in the middle of nowhere, when all of a sudden one of the travelers, a b'tchey, semi-has been movie actress, gets murdered, Then another and another. Who could be doing these despicable things? Let's see we have the the murdered actress's limo driver (Cusack), a newlywed couple, a corrections officer (Liotta)and his prisoner(Busey), a former prostitute(Peet), a lady who had been run over by the limo driver, her husband and 12year old son and the motel manager.
The screen writers and the director do an excellent job of misdirection as the viewers suspicion of the murderer starts with the most obvious and then keeps transferring as more travelers get killed.
Eventually, like a scene out of Twilight Zone, the survivors discover that all of them, alive and dead, have the same birthday, discounting the happenstance of their arrival and pointing to events beyond their control.
How is this possible? How could anyone or anything control the movements of many unconnected individuals and orchestrate their arrival to this lonely place? Then all the bodies disappear!
At this point the viewers are as confused as the participants, as things unravel quickly toward the surprise ending I foretold.

Quite frankly, there's nothing I didn't like about the movie.  The dialog was good, the acting was good, and I give kudos to Cusack and Ray Liotta for their acting skills.  And based upon the plot, it's what I call an intelligent thriller.  Don't expect the answers to come too easily.
Finally, the ending did surprise me but I wasn't disappointed.  It was different and much appreciated. I'd recommend this movie if you like thrillers.",1064448000,2,852,4.48051948051948
1843010,4,B00008EY9G,"I have a few rules when it comes to movies and sometimes they don't always hold true, but there is one that's a lead pipe cinch: ""Anything with John Cusack in it has got to be a pretty good movie.""  Whether it's quirky comedies like High Fidelity or intense dramas like his recent movie Max, John Cusack is right up there with Kevin Spacey, Tom Hanks, and Morgan Freeman when it comes to the great actors working today.  ""Identity"" is not an exception to this rule.
""Identity's"" basic plot can be summed up as a re-hash of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians.  A group of people get stranded at a motel in the middle of nowhere and they all begin to get murdered one by one.  It's hard to write a really in-depth review of this movie though because the more I talk about the plot, the more of the twists and turns will be given away.  Someone else has already mentioned the trailers for the movie building up intrigue about the characters at the motel, so when the movie starts off with something that isn't even mentioned in the trailers, you may be thrown for a loop.  Does it all tie in at the end or is it just independent and work as a ""B"" plot to the movie?  By answering that question, I'll give away a lot of what the movies relies on to drive the final act.
Let me say that this is one of those movies that if you sit and try to figure it out, you might go into a coma because your brain may just shut down from working overtime.  What makes this movie really cool is that there's not just one twist, there's several.  The director shows you just enough to get you thinking one way only to throw something totally different out there a few scenes later.  The only real drawback to the movie is that the ""shocking twist"" at the end seems a bit far fetched, but it does make sense, although I think there's probably a way to make it a little more realistic instead of just kind of coming from left field.  Oh, and if you want to check out the alternate ending, don't blink or look too hard or else you're gonna miss it because that alternate ending is pretty much the original ending with just a couple or three new shots thrown in the mix.",1064188800,2,2148,4.240196078431373

1843012,4,B00008EY9G,"Just when you are about to lose hope for the future of the film industry, someone comes out with a smart movie for adults that despite playing into the slasher genre does so with unusual aplomb.
With nods to Hitchock's ""Psycho"" and Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None,"" ""Identity"" gives us a creepy desert motel soon populated by a host of folks stranded by an unrelenting rain storm that has washed out the roads. A car accident brings in Ed (John Cusack - a burned out ex-cop), now chauffeuring an insufferable C-movie actress from shoot to shoot (an unrecognizable Rebecca DeMornay), and a family of three for first aid. Unable to use the phones to call for assistance, Ed is forced to drive to the local hospital. Along the way, he picks up Paris (Amanda Peet - doing an updated version of Janet Leigh's character in ""Psycho"", but without the shower scene), and a very newly married couple, all three stranded at the eastern end of the washed out highway. With no options, they head back to the motel.
The back story of the film follows an inquest into the mental state of a psychotic serial killer who had murdered six people years before. A psychiatrist has proof that the insanity plea was mishandled, so the execution - set for tomorrow - must be rethought. As the legal teams wait for the killer, they lose contact with his car and driver.
Sure enough, the motel picks up their last two occupants for the night: cop number two, Rhodes (Ray Liotta), and his prisoner (Jake Busey). The stage is now set for murder most foul.
What makes ""Identity"" a cleverer-than-most flick is the deft handling of the death-dealing that proceeds sequentially according to room number. When it becomes apparent that the deaths are proceeding numerically even though some appear to have no means by which they could have occurred in that manner, the spooky factor goes up a notch. Could it be that the tormented spirits of long-dead tribe members - yes, the motel was built on an Indian burial ground - are exacting revenge? And what does it mean that everyone at the motel has the same birthday?
""Identity"" answers these questions with one of the better twist endings you'll see. And for those not satisfied with one mind-bending twist, the filmmakers give you a second one for your money. But sadly, this is where the film goes from the unusual to the cliched, as the second twist is a tried and true slasher gimmick that ultimately costs the film a ratings star.
With a firm R-rating for plenty of vulgarity and a host of gruesome murders, ""Identity"" is certainly not a film for anyone but adults. But the director, James Mangold, deserves some credit for leaving out the anatomical details of the killing process itself, unlike other films in this genre. In truth, no one needs to see just how that baseball bat wound up where it did.
The DVD itself is nothing special, though it does give widescreen and full-screen options, plus your choice of the theatrical release or a very slightly modified extended edition. There's filmographies for the actors, deleted scenes, director's commentary, and a very nicely done set of navigation screens. In all, though, fairly typical of what you'll find on most DVD's today.
With fine casting, smart writing, solid acting, plenty of twists, and a supernatural element, ""Identity"" is far from your run-of-the-mill crazed serial killer flick, making it a worthy addition to the collection of slasher, horror, thriller, and mystery film buffs alike.",1063929600,,3486,4.8116666666666665
1843013,4,B00008EY9G,"This film plays out like a typical slasher movie for the first hour, and then comes the inevitable mind-blowing plot twist.  But...
The plot twist in this movie is a logical resolution to a believability problem the movie was spiralling into.  The introduction of logic into a movie of this genre is in itself mind-blowing.  For that reason alone, I felt my time was well spent with this movie.  I could relax and let its flaws slip past my attention.  But then...
I thought about the movie as a whole, and felt that the plot was still a little ridiculous, but I let it go, because I felt that any movie with a well thought out plot twist deserves some leniency.
My only advice is not to watch this movie more than once, because, absent of the shock of the plot twist, this movie is no better than your average slasher movie.",1063843200,,825,4.401315789473684
1843014,4,B00008EY9G,"This movie, starring John Cussack, takes place mostly within the mind of a character who is an accused killer.  This is not evident in the film until there is a switch in scene to the criminal defendant and his legal and psychiatric team.  This makes the film intriguing, and sets the stage for the search for the true killer within the personality ""alters"" of the main drama.  This leads to a surprise ending, which may not be too surprising to those familiar with real life multiple personality and dissociative identity cases and mind control programming.  This film has a solid plot and convincing performances, and should be a delight for those who are bored by happy endings.",1063843200,,681,4.794871794871795
1843015,5,B00008EY9G,"This is so reminding me of Brian DePalma (I remember commenting the first ten minutes into Identity).  There is no doubt that director James Mangold is drawing heavily on a DePalma influence, or perhaps tapping into a Hitchcock vein.  Whatever the case, this thriller is just the fix I've been after without even realizing it.
I admit to being partial to the cast.  John Cusack (Ed the limo driver with a past) is an actor I will go out of my way to see any time; needless to say, he is brilliant here too.  Amanda Peet, playing a hooker trying to turn her life around, brings her trademark tough smarts to the role and does a great job as always.  Ray Liotta plays his usual sinister-guy-posing-as-normal character, but here it fits nicely.  Rebecca DeMornay's washed-up TV star part is brief enough to nearly qualify as a cameo, but memorable.  The rest of the crew complement this roundup as the assorted bunch that arrive together at the isolated motel on that fateful stormy night that a murderous evil runs amok somewhere outside - or is it inside?
Never fear, this is no mere slasher flick. This *is* a deliciously creepy Whodunit with an added slice of suspense. It is also a real psychological thriller in the old school sense.  In true Hitchcockian tradition there is an underlying plot that manages to bring together the seemingly random people and events that clash so chaotically. The little clues that are dropped here and there are just intriguing enough to give us a taste for the twist that we just know is coming (why is there blood on the back of Ray's shirt just before he covers it up with his jacket?  What's up with the Indian tombs outside?)  Naturally, there is also a false lead or two.  By the time the real killer is revealed we can click those puzzles pieces together with great satisfaction and wonder at how we didn't see the big picture all along.
If I had to compare Identity to another recent film, I would say Memento is the closest in style and quality.  In any event, I'd recommend Identity to anybody who enjoys this classic thriller subgenre.

I noticed its remarkable similarity with Agatha Christie's ""And then there was none"" (The Psycho set-up was a given).  Of course, once the sentenced serial killer was introduced in the screen, everything fell in its place & the movie sort of became predictable (especially the ending).

1843019,4,B00008EY9G,"""Identity"" is a unique horror movie that lives in the audience's mind forever.  Every detail keeps everyone waiting for the next scene.  Most occurances are deceiving; therefore, one must listen closely to fully understand the plot.  The deceits keep the audience anxiously awaiting the next movie viewing.  Many sudden impact surprises keep the audience's hearts pounding in tremendous startlation.
A family drives down a deserted road as a woman's high heel pops a tire.  As they wonder how it stumbled there, the step-father witnesses his wife getting hit by a car by an ex-cop, turned limo driver.  The group rushes for the nearest hospital, but the roads are flooded.  Their only safe shelter is a hotel.  The owner of the high heel, two newlyweds, and cop/convict are surrounded by the flood waters.  As they stumble upon the injury sight, they try to help assure the injured woman's survival.  Little do they know that the worse is yet to happen.  Their relation toward one another becomes crutial in discovering why this is happening to them.
John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea DuVall, Jake Busey, Alfred Molina, and others wonderfully act in this thriller.  Their individual storylines give the audience the added experience.  Cusack achieves the most demanding role of the movie.  The underrated DuVall proves in acting her character's drama that she will be a star in the years to come.
""Identity"" is a movie for everyone looking for a great thrill ride.  Missing a single second will miss a crutial part in the movie.  One will not be disappointed.

1843021,2,B00008EY9G,"Both the story and the director's style of telling it grab you from the start.  It reminded me of ""Memento"" (which I greatly admire) for the first few scenes in the way that it seemed to be progressing backwards, but then it settled into a more conventional narrative.  The lead characters are drawn well enough that I was invested in their stories; I was especially sympathetic to John Cusack's character. It's classic murder mystery fair with a twist.  Ten strangers find themselves stranded by a storm in a creepy motel. One of them is a cop who's transporting a psychopathic killer. Another is a man desperate to get his seriously injured wife to a hospital, but the roads are flooded and the phones are down.  When one by one they start turning up dead, it's a game of wits between the viewer and the screenwriter to figure out who's doing it. Obviously, all is not as it seems.  But when the true nature of the characters was revealed, I felt cheated, bamboozled, duped and angry. I wanted to fire off a nasty letter to the director and the writer; instead, I'm writing this review.  The much ballyhooed double twist at the end is not of ""The Sixth Sense"" variety; the kind of jaw dropping revelation that makes you go, ""whooooa"". No, this ending pulled the rug out from under all of the caring and compassion I had invested in the characters. When the end credits rolled, I hit the stop button in disgust. Without revealing the ending, I can't go into justifying my reaction and I know lots of people disagree from all of the positive reviews I've read.

Clea DuVall is interesting as always, and Amanda Peet seems to add something organic to the film. The cast is well assembled to say the least - an interesting mix of faces.

We miss a clean house, sleeping and the cat, but there's one thing that I really, truly and deeply miss.  Our weekly movie outings.
We would see (almost) everything that came out.  Comedy, action adventure, romance, art house stuff.  We were addicted to films good and bad.  The only thing we didn't see much together was horror.  Wifey would send me along with a couple of dollars for popcorn with a friend of mine or even by myself.  (Want to get scared in a theater?  See a good horror flick solo.)  Well, Identity came out on DVD last week and I HAD to go buy it.  I had heard wonderful things about this film when it came out and I knew it would be something I would love.  This was a flick that I wanted desperately to see in a theater, but it disappeard faster than it takes me to change a diaper.  Well, no excuses now.  I had it ona bright, shiny new DVD.  I suspected I might even be able to get wifey to enjoy it with me.  Right.
The same day it came out a local DJ talked about it on his morning drive-time show and let out a minor spoiler about a head that gets found somewhere.  He went on to say that if you're alone in a house after seeing this you won't sleep for at least a week after.  Convincing her would now be next to impossible.  (Thanks Lander in the Morning!!)
After literally hours of cajoling, bribery attempts and finally guilt (always save guilt for last) she caved, wrapped herself up in a blanket, latched on to my arm and settled in for a night of Hitchcockian suspense.
The head did make us both jump, the baseball bat made me laugh and her cringe, the scenes with the car crashes scared the bejeezuz out of both of us and by the end we were both smiling like idiots.  She looked at me as the credits rolled and said, ""Okay.  You win.  That was really great.""  I did, and it was.
Identity is what Hitchcock would be making were he alive today.  It is a complete reinvention of the suspense thriller, yet a homage as well.  Ten Little Indians meets Friday the Thirteenth.  There is no way to review this film, or even make more comparisons without giving away huge plot points.  One thing I will say is that the marketing for this movie was spot on.  In an age where entire plots, suprise endings and huge revelations are given away in trailers and TV spots, Identity's advertising was incredibly refreshing.  You will not see the ending coming.  I got it about fifteen minutes before the end and just sat there smiling.  The script is tight and very well written.  The acting is amazing with nary a weak performance in the lot.  Direction was perfect.  The hints that become obvious in a second viewing are subtle and border on hidden on the first.

1843026,4,B00008EY9G,"It has been a while since there has been such a great murder mystery than this one. While recently having to sit thru a horrible film that didn't have a drop of fear or intrigue, it is refreshing to see a film that knows how to be scary and have fun doing it. Credit director James Mangold for his stylish, noirish eye, and screenwriter Michael Cooney for concocting a devilish web of mystery and suspense. It's the kind of movie that you will know right off the bat that you will really get into. It all starts during a dark and stormy night. Of course!. It's raining heavily and roads out in the middle of Nevada have been washed out. A group of strangers have been forced to seek shelter at this seedy, off the road motel. They have all crossed paths just minutes before, and it is show thru flashbacks how each one got connected together and ended up at the motel. There is Ed(John Cusack), a limo driver with a past job that makes him a strong leader in working out the mystery. He is driving a washed up actress(Rebecca DeMornay, who despite a hair color change, still looks great). She is the epitome of a spoiled, rich starlet. Success starved, and not willing to spend time in some mundane motel that doesn't have room service. Then there is Ginny(Clea DuValle), and her new husband Lou, who seem to not be the happiest of newlyweds. There's motel manager Larry(John Hawkes), who has some interesting secrets of his own; prostitute Paris(Amanda Peet), who is turning 30 in a week and just wants to go back home to Florida to grow oranges; and a normal, suburban type family led by John C. McGinley of ""Scrubs"", along with his wife(Leila Kenzle from ""Mad About You"" fame), and young son Timothy. Then things get weird when a cop named Rhoades(Ray Liotta), shows up with a prisoner(Jake Busey), in tow. He was supposed to be transferring the prisoner when they got caught up in the storm. There are numerous other things that have gone on and more in depth descriptions of the people, but telling would be spoiling all of the twists and turns this movie will take and how it will keep you thinking. Suddenly, one by one, the stranded motorists begin getting knocked off. When you think one way, you are suddenly proven wrong and think another way, until you finally come to the conclusion that you have no idea what is going on. The mystery is mind boggling and the turns in the story are clever and a lot of fun to figure out. Although you won't. You think that the murderer can't quite possibly pull this off, but it's even more interesting trying to figure out just who is behind it. The performances here are all stand out. Cusack is his usual reliable self, and Liotta is always convincing in everything he does. The rest are all up to the task as well. Jake Busey as the prisoner is good too. Then again, put someone with the last name of Busey in a psycho role, and you usually get an interesting performance. The movie really gets you to think, and Mangold's direction and keen eye for setting up chills and suspense are right on. The rain, the motel, the atmosphere, they are all just as much a part of the cast and the main story as the cast and story itself. What I always love about movies like this that have an eclectic cast of characters and actors is that I love watching how the different personalities interact and how they either disintegrate in the madness, or change for the better because of it. I have to say that the ending, while it may seem like a disappointment, is still very well executed and wonderfully constructed. It is a nice twist, but it does damage, in some way, what you have invested in it up to that point. I wasn't really disappointed because I thought that they had done it in a very creative, and well imagined way. Some people missed that. I really don't know what else to say without getting too much into the movie and giving things away. ""Identity"" is a suspense thriller that brings respect and dignity back to the genre.

1843027,4,B00008EY9G,"""Identity"" is clever, off-the-wall thriller. Plot-wise, it has only one trick up its sleeve, but it's a neat trick that will surprise most people when they see it. Because of this, it's the kind of movie you can ruin for people by giving too much of it away, and I certainly won't do that here.
The movie begins with an old cliche. One dark and stormy night, a group of people, most of who don't know each other, find refuge in a run down motel. They are marooned because the rains have flooded the roads. Telephone and radio communications have also been cut off. The group includes a strange man with an injured wife and a creepy young son, a crazy Hollywood star in the company of her chauffeur [John Cusack], a newly married couple and a police detective [Ray Liotta] taking a convicted killer to an appeals hearing. As the night progresses, these people find out they have more in common than they imagine.
From the onset, everything seems slightly askew, and everyone seems more than a bit odd. It's like an elongated ""Twilight Zone"" episode. About two-thirds of the way, through, a secret is revealed, and it all begins to make a kind of sense.
One of the movie's strongest assets is its cast. Besides lead players Cusack, Liotta and Amanda Peet, the performers include such character actor favorites as Alfred Moline, Clea Duvall, John C. McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vance.",1062892800,,1411,4.693548387096774
1843028,4,B00008EY9G,"When flash flooding caused by heavy rains makes nearby roads impassible, 10 people are stranded at a roadside motel somewhere in the American West: a middle-aged couple with a young child (John C.

One by one, the stranded motorists are murdered. Edward and the police officer take it upon themselves to keep the motel's occupants safe and to find the killer, whom they immediately suspect to be the police officer's escaped prisoner. But even confining the guests to one room where they can observe one another doesn't slow the killer's progress, and panic ensues.

""Identity"" is a thoroughly enjoyable suspense film that is truly worthy of the ""suspense"" genre. It's a slasher movie of sorts, with one gruesome murder after another. But the mystery of the killer's identity is emphasized over the gore. And the killer's identity truly is a mystery. Michael Cooney's clever screenplay and director James Mangold's adept direction give the audience more information than the characters have, so we believe that we may know who the killer is. This increases the audience's investment in the story and helps create suspense. But it turns out that we have incomplete information, as well, which leaves the audience to be surprised but satisfied when the killer's identity is revealed. The film's only real flaw is that we never understand exactly what happened at the motel. I found the difficulty in separating fact from fantasy when all is said and done to be frustrating. This didn't actually detract from my enjoyment of the film until the very end, though. Everyone loves a murder mystery, so I think that ""Identity"" will appeal to a wide audience -although not a squeamish audience.",1062892800,3,2048,5.059171597633136

It isn't a slasher film by any stretch of the imagination, and that's what I liked about it most.  You spend the entire time trying to figure out, along with the characters onscreen, who it is and why they are being killed.

It's a strange group.....a fading movie star and her limo driver, a Las Vegas call girl, some newlyweds, a family in trouble, and a police officer transporting a killer.  They seem to have nothing in common.  But do they?  One by one, they begin to get killed off and they must figure out the secret that brought them together if they want to survive.

Though you would think that it would become easier as the group becomes whittled down, it actually becomes harder to know who the killer is.  Everytime I thought I had things figured out, something would happen and I'd change my mind.  Thre were also several times I gasped in surprise, which is rare for me.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes ""old feel"" horror movies.",1062892800,,1345,4.547717842323651
1843030,5,B00008EY9G,"FASCINATING MOVIE, MAKES YOU THINK:
This is one of those movies that you find fascinating.  At first it all starts to work in together.  Then, for a while, you are not quite sure what is going on.  However,by the ending it all fits back together again.
BEGINS WITH A PSYCHIATRIST REVIEWING A FILE, THEN THE MOTEL SCENE:
The movie starts with a psychiatrist reading over a file that discusses, various horrible crimes.  This psychiatrist is treating an inmate who is scheduled to die for crimes he committed.  This inmate, the psychiatrist thinks is not sane enough to be be aware of these crimes and he feels execution is not the answer, but treatment in a mental institution is more suitable.  It is with this premise, you see him continue to a legal hearing on this matter, before you jump to the situation in the motel.
BASIC PREMISE:
John Cusack stars in this part of the movie that puts several strangers in a motel due to a variety of circumstances.  Most end up there, due to the weather.  Ray Liotta, also plays a pivotal role in this old time horror movie.  I call this an old time horror movie because except for the blood, the gore is kept to a minium.  Also it has the tension and surprises, you would expect from a well crafted horror flick.  All of this is packaged in an interesting twist that you are somewhat warned of.  I really like the way it was done.
AN ODD BUNCH OF PEOPLE, ALL WITH A TWIST:
The people that wind up in the motel all have something either socially, physically or psychologically off, from a mute boy, to a burned out cop(John Cusack).  There was a fussy obsessive type father, a mortally injured mother, a psycho inmate being transported, his transporter with a big secret(Ray Liotta), a motel owner with a secret, a hooker (Amanda Peet), a self-centered has been movie star (Rebecca De Mornay), a young couple with a psychically sensitive girl and a husband prone to rages.
Once the whole group get together, things begin to happen that suggest one of them is killing the others.  The mood is tense and it is not obvious, from the opportunity or the personalities, who might be killing the others.  Many have ample opportunity and the motives range from money to psychotic rage.  However, none point to a single person.
INVOLVED PLOT ENDS IN A SINGLE STORY:
Without ruining the story for you, I can't go much further.  However the acting is all believable and very well done. The movie never drags.  It ends with all the loose ends tied it in one neat package.  Enjoy.",1062892800,,2508,4.570469798657718

1843032,4,B00008EY9G,"IDENTITY is a clever premise that is expertly executed.  This flick pulls you in with an honestly good mix of atmosphere, pacing, plotting, and performance.  A feeling of impending doom shrouds the story revolving around a group of strangers stranded at a remote motel in the unending rain.  When they start getting bumped off one by one ala AGATHA CHRISTIE, the fun begins as the interesting plot unfolds into something unexpectedly non cookie cutter hollywood.  The movie plows though it's ninety minutes and gives the viewer some cool unexpected curves.  An excellent late night noirish chiller that hits the mark.  The 'alternate ending' on the DVD is really nothing special.  There are very subtle differences that do not change the impact of the film.  The film itself, however, is well worth it.",1062806400,,802,5.0227272727272725
1843033,4,B00008EY9G,"Talk about turning a genre inside out. The suspenseful Identity has all the twists and turns of a maze with just as many dead ends. The film starts out like a conventional thriller about a psychotic killer and an attempt to stay his execution. A parallel plot focuses on 10 people who are all trapped at an isolated motel due to a horrible storm.
Suddenly, one of them is picking the others off one by one. There's something almost supernatural about the way this version of And Then There None plays. John Cusack plays a former LA cop who is transporting an actress to Los Angeles. He, along with the other 9 individuals, ends up being trapped at this hotel.
James Mangold creates considerably suspense with his unorthodox aproach to the material. The screenplay was --surprise--written by the screenwriter for Jack Frost and Jack Frost 2. Actually, I'm not surprised he wrote those absurd slasher flicks. They played with the conventions of the genre albeit less successfully and with a much weaker premise than Identity.
The cast all give fine performances particularly the edgy Ray Liotta and John Cusack. Rebecca Morney and Amanda Peet subvert the stereotypical roles their assigned in the movie and also give fine, strong performances. Identity reminds me of Psycho crossed with And Then There Were None. While the mystery at the heart of the film is important, like many amusement rides, it's also about the twists and turns you take on the rollercoaster that are just as important.
The DVD features a special extended version as well as the theatrical version. Both are very effective although I found the theatrical version a bit more powerful--the suspense is unrelenting. Identity would be the type of picture that Hitchcock might have done in his prime (if it was possible to do these types of films during his day)or Jonathan Demme when his work was edgier (a la Silence of the Lambs or Some Like It Wild).
The picture and sound are outstanding and the interactive menu is quite clever as well. The deleted scenes do add a bit more of character depth but, on the whole, it's clear why they were cut--it hurt the pacing of the picture. Why the film includes both the widescreen and fullscreen versions is beyond me. I realize that some folks prefer fullscreen but that's what the zoom feature on DVDs are for. All of the grit and grime of Mangold's stylized visual compositions are aparent on this terrific transfer. There's also a director commentary but I'd suggest watching the film without it the first time as it might spoil some of the ""secrets"" of the film.
It's a pity this terrific thriller wasn't marketed better or released in a less crowded market; it could easily have been the next Silence of the Lambs or Psycho. In the meantime while you're watching this film stay out of dark motel rooms and avoid looking in the mirror.",1062806400,,2849,4.769230769230769
1843034,4,B00008EY9G,"Definitely a good flick but I'm not sure you need to buy it.  A rental would suffice.  One word to the wise; DO NOT buy this for the ""alternate ending.""  It doesn't exist for all intents and purposes.  They add just a few flashes of the main character in a flashback/dream sequence at the end.  That's it!  BIG DEAL!  The advertising on the package touting a widescreen presentation with an extended version is bogus.",1062806400,,417,4.554054054054054

The connection of the two main stories and how they intertwine, the play of timeline, perception of reality, and exploring the mind of a killer and eerie location... (a down and out motel in the desert) all make this a pretty suspenful and interesting movie. kept me guessing and wanting more.
John Cusack, and Amanda Peet stood out in their performances, which also played in the stress of the movie as these two felt unlikely in the situations they were put in.... which helped the unpredictabilty of the film...

The performances are superb and the film is always engaging but the big twist I find clever yet disapointing at the same time. Part of me wishes it stayed focus as a horror/thriller about motel guests being targeted by a killer. In the 2nd act everything changes and I was both surprised and shocked but again disapointed like I said. It's still an extremely original, smart and creepy film though. It keeps you guessing and has one impossible to predict twist after another. If you like  Identity I recommend Raising Caine with John Lithgow as well although it's not as good.",1062547200,,636,4.578947368421052

I could talk about how Pruitt Taylor Vince looks so much like former MTV host Matt Pinfield, I was nearly doubled over with laughter whenever he was in the picture. And oh, how I *COULD* go on about what has to be THE most convoluted plot outside of Donald Kaufman's ""The 3"" from ""Adaptation"" (Seriously. That's all I kept thinking about watching it). But I WILL ask- where is the ""alternate ending"" advertised on the disc supplementals? I watched the extended version all the way through, then cut back to the theatrical cut to see the difference about 10 minutes from the end, but they were EXACTLY the same! I watched all the deleted scenes, but they were just extended scenes from the movie, nothing effecting the outcome. I guess part of me wants to believe that somewhere, somehow there's another part of the movie that would let me forgive all the things that drove me nuts about wasting my time with this movie. But it's just not meant to be. Oh yeah, and John Cusack is the only guy actually acting not just performing here(Or gads-mouthing all her lines at top volume like Clea Duvall), but I still say it's only barely worth a rent if you're easily surprised or thrilled.

Second I was givin' the option of THEATRICAL CUT or EXTENDED VERSION. I choose EXTENDED. It would be nice if all DVD's had these options. Director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted & Copland) whips up the perfect crowed pleaser for horror/suspense fans. The movie delivers a chilling atmoshere. It's dark and rainy, a motel setting in an abandoned area. Eventually the cast comes together at the motel, where one by one they are found murdered and evenually they disappear. It's part slasher film, part who-done-it. Basically IDENTITY is a horror movie with a psycological twist. And by my star rating above you can see I enjoyed it.

1843041,4,B00008EY9G,"Identity is a highly stylized and entertaining horror/thriller.  It is unusual to find a movie these days that manages to maintain both the horrific (with its attendant shock and gore) and the thrilling (with its adrenaline rushes and carefully measured plot revelations) elements, with out resorting to cheap and gratuitous tricks. That Identity manages to balance these competing forces and resist the urge to go over the top, definitely works in its favour.
That said, one of the most memorable things in this movie is John Cusack getting wet.  John Cusack gets wet like no other actor - he revels in rain. He mopes in a downpour like no other actor can, with his everyman act drenched in melancholy and drowning in the turmoil that lies just beneath the surface, the seething puddle of emotions barely contained beneath the glassy surface. John Cusack is an ocean of untold depths and as such he should be forced to stand out in the rain in every movie he does.  Sinking into the mud, there is no other actor that can portray the pain felt inside all of us like a wet John Cusack.  The gaunt face, the sunken eyes made even more pitiful by the stream of water running off his limp and sodden hair.  The clothes sticking uncomfortably to his emaciated body as thought he were the last rat to jump ship from the Titanic.  John Cusack gets wet very well, and given that this movie is set in a thunderous downpour in the Nevada desert, there are ample opportunities for John Cusack to leave the safe confines of his warm, dry motel room and get soaked to the bone.  I think this happens on at least 10 occasions, but I may have lost count at some point.  Somenody needs to by this kid an umbrella - if he dies of pneumonia, it'll be some lousy director to blame for all the untold hours hanging around movie sets damp and chilly.  Not since the classic ""High Fidelity"" has a movie given John Cusack as much opportunity to be washed out on screen and he obviously loves the opportunity to return to his aquatic home.
That said, Identity grabs you and draws you in.  This is not something you can keep on in the background while you do the dishes - unusually for many modern movies, it requires thought, attention and concentration, and in the end one is rewarded for noticing the small details and questioning things all along.  Some parts are a little predictable (the banana who leaves the bunch gets skinned...), and some go too much for the shock value (Baseball bat? NP!), although there is a fair amount of black humour to be found here (Mom and Pop both getting crunched in horrifically gratuitous car accidents while their already disturbed son looks on?).  And of course, without revealing too much of the plot, there's the courtroom drama playing out in Carson City at the same time.
Identity relies on three major twists.  The first of these is huge and brilliant - it comes totally out of leftfield at a time when the plot is on the verge of falling apart, and turns the movie from going bad to being bizarre (Do we need to introduce a plot twist with ""Isn't this like that movie where...?""?).  The second twist is good, but you should've seen it coming for about 30 minutes.  The final twist is kind of silly, and for me brings the movie down from 5 stars to 4.
Overall I highly recommend this film - the characters are good, well developed and sympathetic, the plot is intelligent and gripping, and the cinematography and setting create a great, creepy mood (speaking as someone who has spent a lot of time in shady motels in Nevada, including the ""Shady Motel"", Caliente Nevada...).  The ending leaves a little to be desired, but at least it's not usual Hollywood fodder, and for that we can be thankful.  Oh, and did I mention John Cusack gets wet?",1062547200,,3763,4.559347181008902
1843042,4,B00008EY9G,"It's nearly impossible to review James Mangold's latest film, IDENTITY, without revealing the plot twist that makes this very enjoyable thriller 'work'...and since the director chose not to reveal it, himself, until the film was nearly over, I'll respect his vision, and not give it away!
Two story lines unfold; in one, psychiatrist Alfred Molina has a final session with convicted serial killer Pruitt Taylor Vince, before execution. Despite the defense claiming insanity, the court ruled against it, and the bitterness towards the murderer, and satisfaction the prosecution feels about justice being served are clearly evident, making Molina's task a nearly impossible one.
In the other, a chain of events strands a group of motorists together at a seedy motel, run by John Hawkes (who is excellent as the sleazy manager) during a storm. Composed of a hooker (Amanda Peet), who, with a lost shoe, began the chain; a nerdish husband (John C. McGinley), his wife, seriously injured after being struck by a car, and his stepson; the chauffeur (John Cusack) who struck the woman, and his passenger, a fading movie star (Rebecca DeMornay, who is nearly unrecognizable); a bickering young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and a marshal, transporting a killer (Ray Liotta and Jake Busey). With the roads flooded and phone lines down, the group is isolated...then, in a fashion similar to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, people begin to die! It becomes a race against time to discover who the murderer is...
The two story lines intertwine in a very surprising manner, making IDENTITY far superior to the 'by-the-numbers' gore-fests that pass themselves off as 'suspense', with the climactic twist a stunning revelation that is VERY effective!
If you like your films challenging, you're in for a treat...IDENTITY delivers!",1062374400,4,1833,5.238095238095238

1843044,4,B00008EY9G,"I have always been a sucker for a good thriller, a film that keeps you guessing, throws in red herrings, steers you in the wrong direction and gives you an ending you just didn't see coming. `Identity' may seem like a standard old slasher thriller and ultimately it is, there's nothing remotely revolutionary, most of it borrows from past ideas and its pretty clichd but that's the irony of the film. How do you explain the casting of Ray Liotta (`Unlawful Entry') and Rebecca De Mornay (`The Hand that Rocks the Cradle') who both played menacing terrorisers in the 90's and are now on the opposite end of the knife.
It's a stormy night in the middle of nowhere and a family have stopped to fix a punctured tyre. As the father (John C. McGinley) is changing the tyre, his wife (Leila Kenzle) is struck by a limo. With the wife gravely ill, the limo driver (John Cusack) attempts to get help and takes the family to a nearby motel. The torrential rainstorm also forces several other disparate people to seek shelter in the motel. Included are a young newlywed couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); a faded actress (Rebecca De Mornay) who was being driven by the limo driver; a prostitute (Amanda Peet) and a cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a killer (Jake Busey). Meanwhile the motel is run by a creepy manager (John Hawkes) who isn't all that he seems.  The rain doesn't let up and the 10 strangers are one by one murdered. Who's the killer? Naturally the killer is the first suspect or is it the creepy motel manager? Could it be a ghost since the motel was built on an ancient burial ground? As the murders intensify, the remaining guests begin to find a connection to the murders. Meanwhile the film intercepts with an eleventh hour hearing for a man (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who is convicted of several murders and is about to be put to death. Is there a connection?
James Mangold hasn't really demonstrated his as good of a director as he is for attracting good casts and he usually has more talent than he can utilise with his past films including the star studded `Girl Interrupted' and `Copland'.  In `Identity', again he doesn't use his cast to the greatest effect (De Mornay is doomed pretty early on), but with such an ensemble cast, there isn't the need for any stand out performances because with more characters standing out than others, it puts the film off balance. Everybody is a suspect, nobody is immune, which is very important in figuring out the film because it doesn't go for the easy answer, it makes you think. This all leads to one of those trick endings, which makes you relive the entire film and put it all together. Some may not think it works, but it grabs you and also makes you kick yourself for falling for the detours and tricks the film has in hiding its secret. Its ending is the first conclusion that fooled me since `The Sixth Sense' and `Fight Club' from 1999.
Mangold though has a nice visual style and though clichd, the brutal rainstorm is a necessity for a good thriller, it has an ominous effect that works well here. The motel setting is creepy yet authentic and again there's nothing terribly insightful here, but a standard setting with some killings. The industry has evolved that most thrillers rely on shock tactics to scare audiences, but `Identity' doesn't have any gruesome scenes or outrageous deaths, it's relying on a terrifying and menacing script to creep the audience out and make them think like a good old whodunit. None of the cast are overly great, though Amanda Peet continues to prove herself a great actress while John Cusack and Ray Liotta may be photocopying past performances but they're still good.
`Identity' is a good old thriller that deceives the audience, plays with their mind by giving them detours that go nowhere and requires them to try and piece together the mystery; before ultimately giving them an ending they probably would have never guessed. Its these type of films that make the thriller genre one of the best and we like to play detective and its good to get a good old scare and `Identity' is an effective way to exercise our sleuthing capabilities.

1843045,5,B00008EY9G,"Identity is a thinking person's film.  From the beginning you are examining everything that you see on the screen.  You know it's a mystery and you know it's going to get stranger by the second, so you look at every clue you're given until the end when it's wrapped up.
John Cusack, one of my favorite actors, gives a phenomenal performance as the Ex-Cop/Limo Driver.  Ray Liotta is startling as the Detective and the scenery and weather play just as much a part as any of the actors.  John C. McGinley is one of the greatest character actors around and his performance is very noteworthy.  The hotel is terrifying, and the direction of the film taps into your psyche, making you feel as if you're alone the entire time trying to put this guessing game together.
The clue start off as minimal pieces of the movie, and as the plot unfold the clues get bigger and more important until you've figured it out.  I figured it out around key chain #7 which is pretty deep into the film.  Once you do begin to figure out the mystery, you look back on the much smaller clues and see how pertinent they were in the beginning of the story.  I had to go back and watch it a second time just to see how the beginning pieces fit into place.
