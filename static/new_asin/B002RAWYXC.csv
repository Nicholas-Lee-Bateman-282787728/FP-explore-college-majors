8378536,4,B002RAWYXC,I first bought these two films on laser disc and have enjoyed them often in the intervening years. These DVD transfers are excellent for both picture and sound. Christopher Nupen has his very own distinctive style and these are two of his best films. They merit repeat watching and will bring pleasure to all Tchaikovsky lovers. My only grumble with all the Nupen DVD releases is the lack of English subtitles. Nupen himself speaks most clearly but the same cannot be said of others in the films and the hard of hearing are poorly served. It must also be noted that hundreds of millions of people use English widely as a second language and they really NEED English subtitles to follow the dialogue.,1266278400,6,699,4.691056910569106
8378537,4,B002RAWYXC,"Christopher Nupen has done an excellent job in these two films about Tchaikovsky.  The narrative is concise and accurate.  If you are interested in the life of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, these two documentaries are the best available and a recommended highly.  The only flaw contained in the two films is the mediocre choreography given to Cynthia Harvey.  Showing a clip or two from the ballets would have been preferable.  It would have been nice to include more music and to have included the vocal part to Again, As Before, Alone the last of the Six German Romances, Opus 73.  But this is nitpicking. The two Nupen documentaries are the best to date dealing with the life of Tchaikovsky.  You won't regret buying this superb DVD.",1260835200,4,732,4.808
