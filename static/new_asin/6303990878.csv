2629058,5,6303990878,When I first began my Tai Chi training 20 years ago it was by means of video.  I must say it was very difficult to learn Tai Chi this way.  The Tai Chi Fit videos (Flow and Strength) excel in this area where so many Tai Chi videos fail: ease of learning.  Since all of the movements are done on each side the student does not need to worry if they are doing it on the correct side or not.  Since all of the movements are done facing the screen you do not get turned around and confused either.  Mr. Ross gives enough detail on each move to make it easy to follow without getting bogged down with too many details on fine points.  These DVD's are a great introduction to Tai Chi for fitness: you are introduced to a few of the basic Tai Chi movements found in the traditional forms but do not need to memorize the traditional sequences.  I would highly recommend the Tai Chi fit DVDs to anyone who is looking for an easy entrance into the world of Tai Chi for fitness.,1476748800,,967,4.13903743315508

2629060,5,6303990878,"First off I must tell you that I have been studying with one of Calvin's students for about a year now after hours at work. During that time, we learned  several exercises that not only prep your body but teach portions of the forms that we would be using later making learning faster. We were also taught the Wu style short form which is ideal for those of us who may not be in the best shape starting out offering more gentle moves than the long form.

After about 6 months it was revealed that Master Chin had complete a Tai Chi training video that I just had to have in order to practice more at home, I was not disappointed. Track 1 takes you through the exercises to get in shape and learn postures, exactly like in class. The exercises are in mirror image making it easy to follow.

Track 2 is the Wu style short form (not mirror image) viewed from the front. I use this track to study  form rather than practice with.

Track 3 is the Wu style short form (not mirror image) viewed from behind. At first, I was worried that I would not be able to see what Calvin was doing with his hands while his back was to me. I needn't have worried, a pop-up, screen in screen image appeared showing a small front view simultaneously with the back view. Excellent!

Calvin does a good job calling out the steps and the names of the moves making it easy learn them and at no time did his video feel rushed. I watch this video several times every weekend for I learn something from it every time I see it as I work to perfect my practice, I believe that this training video will help you perfect yours too.",1461024000,,1598,4.222950819672131

To learn the moves for myself, I started with the video CD to see how Cari did the actual moves.  Cari speaks slowly, clearly and gradually initiates you into each sequence.  Her voice is soothing and calm.  After just a couple of the sessions with the video, I started using the audio CD.  Again, Cari takes you through each sequence, slowly adding instructions as the moves progress.  I found myself able to internalize the moves and get more meditative effect using the audio CD.  I especially found that the ""stork"" poses did wonders for my back.

I introduced the 8-10 year olds to the tai-chi moves in my first class.  We started with a 5-7 minute session at the beginning of the class, in the middle and at the end of the class.  The children immediately loved all the animal poses.  It does not matter if the pose is exact, so the kids had fun personalizing the movements.  By the second week, the children would request certain poses and seemed to intuitively know what they needed for each session.  It was amazing to see how much calmer and focused the kids were after a session.  Their concentration levels went up and they were more productive.",1244073600,5,1383,5.061946902654867
2629062,5,6303990878,"What a great teacher.  You get clear instruction and a video presence that makes you forget you are watching a tape. David Dorian Ross makes you feel like he both cares about what he is teaching and about his students which you are now one of.  He talks into the camera in a way that makes you feel he is talking directly to you.  In this tape he presents the Yang 24 posture short form.  What is extreamly helpful is that he breaks down every move teaching only the feet and then only the hands.  His class then demostrates how these are put together then you are invited to join along.  He does one or two postures then does a talk section about a Tai Chi principle.  My only regret was that he does not have a printed guide available through Amazon.com that helps you review and memorize the instructions (which foot to put the weight on and which to move in what direction) when you are reviewing the lesson. It is best to learn one or two postures till you have them memorized before going on.  This will take some weeks to actually work through the tape and learn the form so you can do it on your own. If you want a tape that you can just work through after viewing once try any of his Chi tapes such as his AM CHI for beginners.  But if learning the Yang Style 24 posture Short form is a goal, this is a great tape.  IF you want printed instructions to use in conjuction you might look at Tai Chi Chaun 24 & 48 Postures with Martial Applications by Master Liang, Shou-Yu & Wu, Wen-Ching.",1030838400,18,1495,4.2140350877192985

2629070,5,6303990878,"This is a new tai chi program from YMAA and David-Dorian Ross. I first became aware of Ross in 1997, with his Hawaiian public TV series, Tai Chi in Paradise. He is a 35-year veteran of the art, having won seven U.S. national gold medals, a world silver, and two world bronze medals. Tai Chi Fit: STRENGTH is highly recommended as a starting point for people new to tai chi. It is very easy to follow: all the movements are performed in a mirror view, which many learners find the easiest to work with. The program actually includes moves from tai chi, qigong and yoga, all designed to fortify the entire body, enhance bone density and boost cardiovascular performance. In line with the title of this dvd, ""Strength,"" the viewer alternates between movements holding a tai chi ball (or whatever other small weight is at hand) and empty-hand movements. Each new movement is introduced as part of a continuous, unbroken sequence, building each form in a simple, step-by-step process. For example, Ross often introduces the placement of the feet, followed by that of the left hand, then the right hand, and finally, any required stepping. This is possibly the best, most straightforward method I've seen for teaching the basic tai chi movements. Each form is practiced on both the left and right sides so that the learner gets comfortable with both from the beginning. A common complaint among people who have tried to learn tai chi without success is that it is difficult to memorize all the different movements. With Tai Chi Fit: STRENGTH, this is completely unnecessary. Viewers can simply follow along. Ross is a polished, likable instructor, using humor as he explains in everyday language how each of the movements should look and feel. For example, when introducing the movement Snake Creeps Down, he says that learners wonder ""how low to go."" His response: ""The point of the form is not getting low, it's letting go."" For more experienced tai chi players, this DVD provides an excellent routine for revisiting the core forms and adding the dimension of strength training with the small weights/tai chi balls. An excellent contribution to spreading tai chi, with a seasoned pro as the instructor and a teaching approach that's lighthearted, fun and impossible to be confused by.",1481241600,,2280,4.9246753246753245
2629071,5,6303990878,"David-Dorian Ross makes working out fun.  This video is a step up from Tai Chi flow in terms of workout. I confess that I didn't make it through the whole workout...but I will.  This video combines tai chi with strength moves such as squats and uses tai chi balls (or a pair of soup cans) for upper body strength training. Many of the moves are the same as those in Tai Chi Flow, but with additional challebpnges in the repetitions. He has also added some yoga poses to improve flexibility. I love how easy it is to follow along and that I have a smile on my face throughout.",1480809600,,575,4.26605504587156
2629072,5,6303990878,"Tai Chi Fit Strength wonderfully complements the Tai Chi Flow DVD. After learning the movements of Flow and getting into Tai Chi both physically and mentally, the student can further his education and workout by following the movements in Strength. This DVD offers a more strenuous workout by introducing the Tai Chi ball and some introductory movement of Chi Qung and Yoga.

The movements are more strenuous than the first DVD but still relaxed and comfortable. You follow the instructor's movements so there are no set forms to memorize, just follow along with the easy going style and you have the workout. I would advise to go along with the exercise in certain intervals because of the length of this program and the new movements introduced. It is a bit longer but worth the effort.

I really enjoyed both DVD's and I know that the two complementary instructions will benefit anyone wishing to enter the Tai Chi world.",1480377600,,924,4.841772151898734
2629073,4,6303990878,"Another really good DVD by David-Dorian Ross and a great complementary workout to his ""Tai Chi Fit: FLOW"" dvd.  As I had mentioned in my review of the FLOW dvd, while this is not Tai Chi in the traditional sense of learning a Tai Chi form (like the well know 24 posture Simplified Form) it does present the core Tai Chi movements in a unique way and presents a fun and challenging workout with common Tai Chi movements (with a little dose of Qigong and Yoga added into the mix).  I am reminded of how my 24-form teacher from China taught us in a very similar manner, i.e. performing each of the movements on both the right and left sides over and over, getting the technique down, and not worrying about where they fall in the 24 form.  Therefore, I would recommend this DVD to a student to familiarize themselves with the core movements of Tai Chi, or anyone interested in trying a unique Tai Chi style workout.  I would also recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Tai Chi that might otherwise be turned off by other videos that can sometimes deliver Tai Chi in an airy-fairy, hippie-dippie manner.  David-Dorian Ross had a relaxed, practical, and accessible delivery that makes this video valuable to your Tai Chi journey.",1480204800,4,1228,4.589041095890411

2629076,5,6303990878,"This workout is not only great for strength, it also gets your Qi flowing and tingling alike (extra promoted by the integrated Qi Gong and Yoga moves). The strength part can be individually tuned by the selected weight, depth of stances and heights of kicks. The workout alternates sequences with and without weighted balls and a kick sequence. Especially after putting down the weights, the hands are tingling like mad. It starts easy without balls working: Sinking the qi, opening the door, embracing the moon, wagging the tail and shaking the head. A ball sequence follows: sinking the qi, opening the door, push, princess on the mountain top, princess in the valley. Then a series of kicks working your legs. There is a little rest with a ball-less sequence: repulsing the monkey, brush knee and the taking up the balls again: grasping the sparrows tail. After putting down the balls DDR includes some Yoga moves and then hands wave like clouds and end in single whip. He repeats this with balls and adds snake creeps down. Finally with balls resting on the ground we chase the snake in the grass empty handed. Now with all this tingling going on it is a nice movement to get even more aware of the Qi flow in the body and around. DDR finishes with opening of the heart.
Inspired by DDRs advice: keep moving, keep breathing and keep smiling, I did quite a gentle strength version and was amazed by the intense tingling of the released qi flow. And the other day my sore muscles made me realize that even my gentle version worked on my strength. The workout is easy to follow and well-thought-out. I love that DDR emphasizes flow and relaxation especially in a strength workout, since the strength is in the softness!",1479513600,2,1720,4.698675496688741
2629077,5,6303990878,"After I practiced the workout of the FLOW-version of this series for quite a while, I wanted to add an additional challenge. This DVD really takes the practice of the first DVD to the next level. Alternating sequences in- and excluding the weighted Tai Chi Balls (or any alternative that fits in your hands - as David-Dorian Ross explains in the video) make the workout a lot more challenging. Once again the teacher with two of his students lead you through a 50 minutes program and the direct conversation like instructions keep motivation up until the end of the workout.
Additionally part of my FLOW revision can be pasted here due to similar features.

""This mirror view presentation makes it easy to follow the moves while the spoken instructions are always added in a very friendly and encourageing manner. You immediately feel like being in the same room with him and his students and as if in a studio are directly encouraged to move with him.

All the moves are repeated to the left and the right to have a balanced workout and en passant you learn about the names of the moves which are mostly very poetic and add a deeper understanding of the moves intentions.

Due to the continuity the length of the program is quite challenging but the variety of the presented moves and the increased complexity in the course of the program keep it fascinating until the very end.

The content of this David-Dorian Ross DVD offers a very good impression of what his online LIVE classes are about.
For the beginner who's interested in getting to know Tai Chi and start in a convenient way, I can absolutely recommend this program.""

2629078,2,6303990878,"As with Tai Chi Fit FLOW, I went to great length to try and find a DVD preview for this workout and I found it. The video trailer shows outdoor scenes, people working out in a garden and beach, BUT this workout is performed INDOORS only, which is a great disappointment to me. I am not happy, because I wanted an outdoor filmed workout. Producers should stop deceiving people with photos (back-cover) that do not fully represent the location of the workout. I purchased Flow and Strength, so I spent close to $50 for something that was misrepresented.",1477958400,5,551,4.63265306122449
2629079,5,6303990878,"I never thought of Tai Chi as a strength training activity, but David-Dorian Ross has created the perfect synthesis of flow, mindfulness, and fun that makes it happen. The Tai Chi Fit Strength DVD is one seriously great workout. It is one of the most satisfying and rewarding Tai Chi routines Ive ever done. I feel relaxed and energized each time I practice.

The routines are so accessible. The instructions are Just follow along. Its unbelievable. No thinking required. Its all there. David-Dorian Ross shares with us everything we need to experience effortless flow. With the addition of his students, Rick and Cassie, who participate in all the routines, there is always someone I could relate to who matched my ability level. This really took the pressure off when practicing. Plus, watching all three people move beautifully in sync together really added to my flow experience.

Theres both empty hand and weighted ball movements. And if you do not have weighted Tai Chi balls, which I dont, there are easy ways to use substitutes. Mr. Ross puts flowing Tai Chi movements, Qi Gong and yoga all beautifully together. What a great marriage of flow and strength training.

The close up shots are good for detail. It feels like David-Dorian Ross is in the room with me. His I don't care philosophy takes the pressure off, so theres no measuring or worrying about doing the movements right or wrong. The best part is that the breath leads the movements so I just relax and go along with the DVD. Its so natural and easy.

David-Dorian Ross has put together the perfect combination of movements and postures that both are accessible and challenging. His Tai Chi Fit Strength DVD will keep my interest and keep me practicing for a long, long time. I highly recommend this program to both beginners and advanced Tai Chi players.

2629081,5,6303990878,"This DVD is a way for people to slowly and gradually build up strength and bone density. It uses very light weights and very short repetitions. Don't worry, if you don't own a set of weights, just grab a few cans of soup or plastic water jugs. This tai chi workout program is perfect for the beginner student.
 I have taught tai chi for 20 years and Internal Kung Fu for 5 years and I like the way David-Dorian Ross talks the students through the ""form"". He uses words like, move this hand or lift the leg in that direction, instead of saying right or left. That makes it easy to follow because the person watching doesn't have to think, ""Is it his right or my right?"". They just have to move the way he points. Instead of saying to ""step 45 degrees, as most Yang style forms move"", he says ""step into your corner"". Couldn't be easier to follow. He also says to ""put one hand above the foot and the second hand above the knee"", this keeps the balance in the center of the person, without long explanations. He also tells you to breathe and smile. If you are going too low and can't smile, you are too low! Easy cues make the left and right flowing form fun to follow. No need to memorize long, complicated forms, just pop in the DVD and follow along. This tai chi workout program is perfect for the beginner student.

Mastering these balance exercises would develop a useful life skill. I like the weighted work; it makes the movements much easier when you put the weights down, like the way your legs feel when you take a pair of skates off.
