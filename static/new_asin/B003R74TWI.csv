4180416,2,B003R74TWI,The author comes from a prospective the gospels' literal truth. He picks and chooses gospel passages without regard to context. The gospels are different and often contrdictory. He fails to point this out.,1393632000,4,205,5.242424242424242
4180417,5,B003R74TWI,"Helped me to better understand ideas about the Christ and his relation with me.

Def recommend this to people that want to untangle some of the knots the have in their mind about specific points in the bible, as well as historical information to back it up.

David Hulme helped me personally understand some things I had on my mind (the point about adult baptism), and why the Old Testament really matters.

I will watch again. Good stuff.",1392076800,4,439,4.602564102564102
4180418,3,B003R74TWI,"While I already knew most of what Mr. Hulme said, I was very glad he explained the meaning of the 3 days of Yah'Shua in the tomb.  No matter how many books or articles I've read, this has never been explained adequately until now.  And Mr. Hulme should have used the Hebrew names for Yah'Shua and YAHWEH.  See Exodus and Isaiah.

Now to the ""facts""--facts and faith do NOT contradict one another!  In the modern world (and for a modern person to say it), it may sound strange.  It really isn't.  Yes, it would be better to be perfectly and historically accurate in the modern sense.  Will it help faith? Maybe.  The important thing is to be totally committed to YAHWEH,  (which means to believe, love Him with all your heart, soul, mind and strength) and to cling to Him always, as did His Beloved Son, Yah'Shua.  And to love your neighbor as yourself--see Leviticus!

And by the way, if you are having an obedience problem, you are having a love problem, as one author so accurately pointed out.",1382659200,4,996,4.5027932960893855

4180422,5,B003R74TWI,"This show is so true!  I'd recommend this to everyone.  It's jam-packed full of facts that are, most importantly, Biblically and historically accurate.  It's about time we got a really good, Biblically based, documentary that just tells the facts.  It was such a breath of fresh air watching this, that I bought it for my own personal collection.",1445385600,,346,4.913793103448276

4180441,1,B003R74TWI,"Jesus said, ""Let no man deceive you.""  It is very hard to pin down David Hulme to truth about his past, beliefs, and agenda.  He came from the Herbert Armstrong Worldwide Church of God cult and supposedly embraced the true gospel when it was discovered after Armstrong died, then went astray again.  Joined another cult, left or was kicked out, and then formed a cult called Church of God Worldwide Community. To get the statement of beliefs one must make a financial contribution or join the ""church.""
This is a well-made documentary but not to be trusted. He does not believe in the Trinity.",1423699200,10,593,4.6826923076923075
4180442,5,B003R74TWI,i study alot and enjoy programs with substance..for example historical or biblical,1418515200,,82,5.916666666666667
4180443,4,B003R74TWI,This is a documentary that I'd recommend all Christians to watch!,1409270400,,65,5.0
4180444,5,B003R74TWI,"This video sheds light on biblical and historical truth which supersedes some Christian traditions. For example: I had sometimes wondered how it is that tradition says Jesus died on Friday and then rose on Sunday, when Jesus said it would be three days and nights, like Jonah. This video explains the day and time discrepancy, and brings insight to other aspects of Jesus life.",1405209600,,377,4.90625
4180445,5,B003R74TWI,"The analysis of the meaning of Jesus' sayings and mission is outside the box of traditional Christianity ~ something I learned many, many years ago in a Bible course on ""Jesus Life and Ministry, a year long analysis of both using the Bible and other texts.  That year with Mr. Bell and his erudition on little known facts and his scholarship spent over a long life-time in service and missions overseas taught me more than I can express in this small space.  One thing is clear: many follow religiosity and churchianity, without a clue as to the real implications of HIS life.  LIke rare gems and precious metals one must dig and dig to find the TRUTH and few find it!  Jesus did not come to save everyone, but only those intent on doing HIS WILL DAILY!",1400457600,2,753,4.474452554744525
4180446,3,B003R74TWI,"The commentator makes a big issue about Jesus not being born 0BC, but rather 4 BC, and says if errors are made in something so minor then the big issue can not be trusted, that in itself is a big assumption. Later it makes a big assumption, that Jesus was a general contractor, and he would have experienced much of the city Seperus, While possible, again and again and again the commentator tries to make many educated guesses, but ultimately they may just be unproven assumptions.  The views of the show battle against the Catholic traditions which were based on centrally old educated guesses (3 gifts=3 magi), that are no longer valid assumptions. Watch and Enjoy, but don't believe without some biblical meditation.",1398556800,5,720,4.853658536585366
4180447,5,B003R74TWI,This video helped clear up a lot for me. in a day and age where many say the gospels don't make sense or that the bible contradicts it self this video helps to put the peace together so it makes sense and proves the gospels do not contradict them self. has been helpful for explaining timelines how things happened instead of the normal believe the world teaches that does not make much sense.,1397260800,3,393,4.397260273972603
4180448,5,B003R74TWI,"I found this video educational.  It invites you to look beyond tradition and think.  Not sanctimonious, just straightforward analysis of what the Bible says.",1395014400,6,157,5.5
4180449,5,B003R74TWI,"The visuals are beautiful in this Quest for the Real Jesus, and the history and background of the middle east make this a worthwhile and interesting experience.",1394323200,4,160,4.962962962962963

8403326,2,B003R74TWI,"David Hulme is somewhat secretive. It is difficult to find clear professions or core beliefs by him. He has moved from 'church' to 'church' starting his own congregations. Here is one website called Church of God,
an International Community ""cogaic.org"" that does give a little info with at least one external link ""vision.org"". Which also has a 'privacy policy' 6-8 times longer than his 'About us' page if that tells you anything.

This 'Church of God' building is as follows in his statement: ""The Church office at 476 South Marengo Avenue in Pasadena occupies a historic Southern California craftsman-style house built in 1906.""

Sounds expensive. My guess is that it is his own house. You can see the picture of it @ cogaic.org under the 'contact us' tab.",1479686400,,760,4.9296875

8403329,5,B003R74TWI,"Excellent and factual. Question what is revealed here? Research it for yourself. This documentary backs up the research I've already done; but many remain deceived. Read the Word of God for yourself! Stop relying on others to tell you what it says. Ask the Father for discernment and to remove the blinders from your eyes.

""See that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men and the basic principles of the world rather than Messiah.""  Colossians 2:8

This documentary is just the tip of the iceberg on what Satan, god of this world, has deceived the church about.",1469836800,2,622,4.849056603773585
