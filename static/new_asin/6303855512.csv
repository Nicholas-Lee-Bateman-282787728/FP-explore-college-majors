731886,5,6303855512,"SMOKE....A NEW LEVEL OF ENTERTAINMENT!
If you thought your life was boring, meaningless, and without any deeper perspective than what you see on the surface...then you haven't seen SMOKE! This brilliant story was created by author Paul Auster and brought to life through the extroadinary talents of Harvey Keitel and William Hurt. Keitel plays Brooklyn tobacco store owner, Auggie Wren. Hurt portrays his customer/friend, Paul, a struggling writer,left emotionally devastated by the death of his pregnant wife and unborn child. There is so much to absorb in this film, but the show belongs to Auggie who finds some order in his disorderly life through photos he takes of his store front....at the same exact time...same exact place...every single day into the years. As time passes before him, the store front is the same, but life evolves into a procession of changing faces and scenes. This unique concept unravels to express the greater continuity of life and totally captivates the viewer. Exceptional photography adds depth to this startling level of awareness and totally captures your complete attention. Stockard Channing, Forest Whitaker, and Ashley Judd are perfect supporting characters in this intertwining tale of tales. Keitel's Christmas story is so thought provoking that characters and audience alike are perfectly connected in the rarest of moments. Sadly, the movie leaves many questions fully unanswered, but perhaps as in life itself, that is the final point to be made!
AN INEXCUSABLE OMISSION FOR HARVEY KEITEL AT THE OSCARS!",1039132800,6,1548,5.348360655737705
731887,5,6303855512,"Smoke performs a rare feat. It captivates you, and takes you on a journey.  It does this without much action. This is an actors movie, Wang leaves it  to the performers to move the story along. No special effects, or  uneccessary action sequences here. Just down to earth charachters with  flaws. The story intertwines these charachters, and we learn each of their  sad stories and regrets. From Paul(William Hurt)a novelist who lost his  passion, to Auggie(Harvey Keitel) a tobbaco store owner who wades through  life each day. You and I know these kind of people. We see them in  restaurants, on the bus, and everywhere else we go. Smoke not only is a joy  too watch, but it provides a valuable lesson as well. The realization that  everyone has their own story to tell.",965606400,7,772,4.6940298507462686
731888,4,6303855512,"Smoke is an involving and literate peek into the lives of a Brooklyn tobacco store owner and his writer friend. Stripped of all Hollywood excess, it blows a puff of wry recognition into our eyes and charms us with  meaningful conversation.  Rarely is a slice-of-life tale so  intoxicating. The acting, often captured in long, stationary shots invites  us with words and teases us with stories. The most shattering of these  being the Christmas story Auggie (Keitel) relates to Paul (Hurt) toward the  end of the film. Director Wayne Wang and writer Paul Auster give us reason  to cheer for their lackluster but likable characters building lasting  relationships and taking life one day at a time.  Smoke's a real killer,  but I guarantee you'll die with a smile on your face.",945907200,4,775,4.892307692307693
731889,4,6303855512,"I find it really very strange that throughout his long and illustrous carreer Harvey Keitel has been nominated just once for the Academy Awards! His lazy way of telling a story at the end of ""Smoke"" should have  deserved at least a nomination, not to talk about his brilliant  performances in ""Taxi driver"", ""Pulp fiction"",  ""Mean streets"", or ""The piano"".",931910400,6,356,4.9
731890,5,6303855512,"In an era where big budget glitz rules the film industry, a well crafted movie like Smoke is a breath of fresh air. Harvey Keitel, who plays the central character of Augie, is the one constant in an ever-moving stream of  humanity that is Brooklyn. Augie is both witness and participant,and  through the lens of his street corner perched camera, we  realize that the  world is made up of millions of stories, nearly all of which are in some  way compelling. William Hurt's character is one such story. Once a prolific  writer, Hurt's talent has been thwarted by life's brutality, one which we  are reminded of constantly thoughout the film. Finally, he is able to deal  with the grief of his wife's loss throught the selfless act of helping a  young runaway. The scene where Hurt spots his wife in one of Augie's street  corner photographs is one of the films many poignant moments. Great  performances are delivered without exception by all the actors, but as is  the case in so many of his films,Mr. Keitel steals the show. Probably more  so than any actor of his generation, Harvey Keitel has mastered the ability  to create characters who are both human, warts and all, yet also  sympathetic. The telling of his Christmas story to the faithful customers  of the smoke shop is probably the highlight of this film and is simply a  brilliant piece of story-telling. What makes Smoke so different from  mainstream movies is the fact that one can't help but feel that one is  watching a well acted play, in that every line of dialog is so crucial,  every character so meaningful. Not a scene could have been deleted without  seriously damaging the final product, and when was the last time you could  say that about a film? Smoke portrays Brooklyn convincingly as an exotic  stew of diverse cultures and personalities, and in at least some of these  personalities we must surely see a bit of ourselves.",913680000,4,1901,4.708206686930091

Almost everyone speaks like they have an Ivy-league education, despite the fact that everyone but the writer is poorly educated.  Totally unbelievable to the point it is impossible to think of these characters as anything but cardboard cutouts.  The plot twists seem contrived, and are blandly predictable.

731983,5,6303855512,"This 1995 film is one fine creation that will continue to last as an inspiring art form.  Anchored by Harvey  Keitel as a the owner of a corner cigar shop in Brooklyn and William Hurt as a grieving writer who visits the shop for his smokes, it weaves in the lives of others who show up there (and includes Stockard Channing, Forest Whitaker, and Ashley Judd).  Sometimes the camera quietly moves in for very close shots going from Keitels to Hurts face as they converse.  These guys, at the top of their game, are mesmerizing.  Some of the stories involved are two men who lose their wives, the estrangement of a father and son, and a mother trying to save her daughter from drug addiction.

It's definitely the type of film that rewards the more patient viewer. It's not  the typical flick full of non-stop action, suspense, or special effects. It has something much more rare than that - a great story, a great cast of characters, wonderful performances and a pace that allows you to truly absorb and savor the tales being told. The direction is spot on and the standout acting (by Harvey Keitel, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt and Stockard Channing in particular) is a treat to watch. Based on the writing of acclaimed author Paul Auster (who wrote the screenplay as well), the movie is like a visual volume of short stories, which intertwine and overlap in interesting ways.

Turns out that SMOKE is brilliant, and one of my top ten films.  Forest Whitaker (who appears on screen for all of ten minutes) gives an amazing performance.  And I've always loved William Hurt's ""less-is-more"" style of acting.  This is a character and dialogue driven film, but that is not to say it doesn't have a compelling plot, a little suspense, and perhaps a bit too much melodrama.

732092,3,6303855512,"As a previous reviewer said, I was just channel surfing when I happened upon the Movie ""Smoke"" the first time.  As you learn more about the everyday characters and their lives, we find out how unceremoniously how bravely they live their lives, you are reminded to treat every single person with respect and compassion.  They receive no medals, get no parades, but they do the best they can with what they have to work with.  Excellent, funny, yet with surprising depth of thought, each line carefully crafted for the best effect.  I am buying it so I won't ever lose it, as I plan on putting this movie in quite often.  Reliving these uncommon common heroes tales, I regain a new hope for humanity and human kindness.",1356566400,,717,4.6141732283464565
732093,5,6303855512,"I first saw this movie when in came out in 1995 and then bought the BD in 2012. It is still am amazing film about human nature, love and New York. This kind of stuff could only happen in New York. People of entirely different backgrounds crossing paths for an incredible series of adventures and misadventure. Yes, incredible, but then again this is a movie.

However the emotions that play out in the story are very real, and no doubt will resonate with many viewers.

One last note about the title: smoke is the common denominator of all the stories that intertwine in the course of the film, which is centered around daily life in a cigar store. A pretty unique place where the owner, disenchante with life, can meaningfully put together a series of albums of four thousand pictures of the same place. I won't tell you how this actually makes sense so as not to spoil the film for you. And, how do you weigh smoke? You actually can, really, just watch the movie!",1355356800,,965,4.4772727272727275

732097,4,6303855512,"This is a very thoughful movie. The highlight is the scene in which our friend the tobacconist shows the Pulitzer Prize winning author his collection of photos. The interaction is profound. The scene is all about ""seeing through the eye rather than with the eye."" Annie Dillard would approve. In an age of superficiality and frantic busyness we can learn that ""we won't get it if we don't slow down."" And it's not only slowing down the speed at which we move that is important, but giving ourselves the opportunity to live more contemplatively. We live incredibly frenetic lives which cause us to experience all sorts of problems. But we were created to live in the moment, not pump our bodies so full of adrenaline that we can't sleep. The whole movie is worth watching, but this one scene alone is worth the price of the entire film. Have a look.",1297728000,,848,4.622516556291391
732098,5,6303855512,"How much does smoke weigh?  This is the question that William Hurt ponders as he makes his daily visit to Harvey's cigar shop.  He speaks in such understated eloquence that you find yourself wanting to scoot in closer to hear his answer.  You're soon swept into the lives of a diverse group of people, each with a compelling story to tell.  The scene where Harvey is showing William his photo album--Harvey would take a picture at the same exact spot at the same exact time of day, everyday--is gut-wrenching when William suddenly comes upon a photo of his wife crossing before the camera.  His wife had died a while back, a loss that Willima had never really healed from, and here she was, alive, walking down the sidewalk, an unwitting subject of one of Harvey's daily photos.  Harvey, (Augie) matter-of-factly tells William that she was in several of his photos.

Perhaps that is an ample metaphor for the remainder of the movie, where each character is show-cased in his own scene, a little piece of their lives being filmed for the rest of us to see.  A remarkable film about ordinary people who have a few extraordinary moments of pain, melancholy, and generosity.",1292457600,,1170,4.729064039408867

I thought it would be perfect for me.  I was wrong. This movie is well-acted.  There are moments of freshness, and I very much liked the scene in which Auggie and Paul are looking through Auggie's photo albums. I thought then this would be a special movie, but I was disappointed. Three-quarters of the way through, I was still waiting for another scene like the early one that really hooked me.  I didn't find one, and I had no idea why I was watching the film.  I understand this is a ""slice of life film,"" and I understand the metaphor of the title, ""Smoke,"" but this movie dissipates too rapidly, is a little too insubstantial. I was never really engaged by the characters; I never really was able to get behind the facade, so to speak.  Throughout the film, I didn't really care whether I saw it through to the end or not, though I will say the ending was nice as a stand-alone.

732174,5,6303855512,"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

picture and audio, is top-notch.",1270166400,,2171,4.804289544235925

Writing: Flawless
Acting: Flawless
Directing: Quiet and Simple, beautiful.

Also, if you have seen ""Blue in the Face"", which covers more story about some of these same characters (Also by Wayne Wang), this film is SOO very different.  That movie was upbeat and silly, this one is so understated and brilliant.

Director Wayne Wang and co-director and scenarist Paul Auster have crafted a film that at turns funny, poignant, and tragic in a way that will always stay with you.  Some may be turned off because the film centers on a Brooklyn tobacco shop and for sure there is a lot of casual smoking here but that's just a starting point for a script that follows a variety of interesting characters and many intriguing story twists.  Harvey Keitel as Auggie the owner of the store gave what I thought one of the best performances of his career.  The film is populated by great work(William Hurt, Forrest Whitaker, et. al) but Auggie is the glue that holds the film together.  The extended scene where Auggie relates to the writer played by Hurt a Christmas story is worth the price of admission alone.  Even better is the scene over the end credits where Auggie's story is visualized as Leonard Cohen warbles on the soundtrack.  Also noteworthy is an unforgettable cameo by Ashley Judd as Stockard Channing's drug-addled daughter.

732179,4,6303855512,"Smoke (Wayne Wang, 1995)

Wayne Wang has had a kind of up-and-down career over the years, but Smoke is definitely one of his up moments. Not to say there couldn't have been some things done better here, but Wang takes Paul Auster's script and a fantastic stable of actors and just lets them loose. By all reports, Auster's script ended up taking quite a beating at the hands of the actors-- how much of the movie's dialogue is improvised has been a hotly-debated topic for years, but even the most conservative figures are pretty high-- but the end result is worthwhile.

The movie focuses around Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel), the owner of a cigar store, and his customer/friend Paul Benjamin (William Hurt), a writer trying to overcome the recent death of his wife. In the main storyline, into their lives steps Rashid Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau), a kid on the run from a couple of gangsters. The movie then spins off onto tangents involving Rashid, Paul, and Auggie separately-- Rashid finds out his father (Forest Whitaker) is alive and living outside the city, Auggie's ex-girlfriend Ruby (Stockard Channing) shows up to tell him he's got an eighteen-year-old daughter, Paul; of course, is still dealing with his wife, and the resulting writers' block.

With all that Wang tries to fit into a surprisingly short movie, some of the plotlines get short shrift. Especially puzzling is the minuscule amount of screen time given Ashley Judd, who plays Auggie's daughter; their brief conversation opens a lot of doors into a lot of different places this movie (or a sequel) could have gone, and there's no follow-up. But still, what's here is grand, and well worth watching. *** ",1167782400,2,1679,4.901408450704225

The plot is inspired by a line from ""My Dinner With Andre"" which was quoted almost verbatim in the original trailer. The thesis of the film is that if one were to tune one's mind and senses sharply enough to really see reality, even the corner tobacco store would be a philosophical minefield, perhaps too terrifying to traverse.

However, while the film is well written and well acted, one may be forgiven for some serious eye-rolling as regards one subplot in which a white man ""saves"" a troubled black youth - I'm all for Liberal Guilt, but please, filmmakers, give us a break!

The cast is one of those rare combinations of individuals who seem to bring out the best in one another, like a good rock band.  As with any great film, it is a story well told.  It's a feel-good movie that avoids being sentimental, or overly simple.  The characters are believable and the story is entertaining.

So, why three stars for a great movie?  Because, at one time, it was even greater.  When first released to theaters and then to VHS, it was a different film.  It began with a Jerry Garcia video that just set the tone for what was to come.  I also remember more cameos in the film.

732235,5,6303855512,"I recently programmed an at-home double feature consisting of SMOKE and GOING MY WAY.  Not exactly an obvious pairing, you might say, but they went together surprisingly well and served as proof positive that I like my sentiment with a dollop of metropolitan grit (or in the case of SMOKE, more than a dollop).

SMOKE has long numbered among my 10 or 20 favorite films.  It's difficult to say just why I haven't posted a review of it until now.  Perhaps because it is so rich, I have avoided taking on the task of explaining its impact to on me to others.  SMOKE has a hold on me that few others do, but (for once) I'm at something of a loss to explain it.  Which is odd in a way--because I think it has something to do with the way we communicate with each other or fail to.  The dialog in the movie, for the most part, rings truer than in most movies--even most GOOD movies.

That doesn't mean that all this authentic talk is meaningful communication.  These are regular Joe's (and a few Joannes) who aren't much into ""sharing.""  That's not to imply that their verbal exchanges are meaningless, but when they're talking sports or cigars, they're doing what the composer of Louis Armstrong's ""Wonderful World"" described so aptly when referring to ""folks shakin'hands, sayin' 'How do you do?""  They really are kinda sorta saying, ""I love you.""

But we don't want to get too schmaltzy here.  SMOKE gets in your eyes, and in your heart, by employing such time honored devices as allowing its characters to keep their rough-edged exteriors, but letting the audience see their soft hearts underneath.  Take the two father-child reunion sub-plots.  The father-son re-encounter (the one that ultimately succeeds) contrasts sharply with the father-daughter(?) reunion that, for all intents and purposes, seems like a total failure.  But even in that tragic instance, there may be a grain hope tucked away, thanks to the selflessness of a man who really doesn't believe that he is this lost girl's biological father. His willingness to come to the aide of a young woman who is likely NOT his flesh and blood speaks volumes about the true meaning of ""charity.""  It takes a village--and sometimes it takes a borough.

It bothers me somewhat that the film in its DVD and VHS format seems to have been marketed as a laff-riot comedy.  I don't recall if that was true when it was in theatrical release, but whatever the case, it's a big mistake. The cheery illustration of Keitel, flanked by a healthy-looking Ashley Judd and a sexy Stockard Channing, belies the movie's harsher reality.  Yes, SMOKE does offer a few laughs, but they are hard won and even a little bitter.  The tagline ""Where's there's SMOKE, there's laughter..."" isn't even half the story.  There are tears too, of course.  And there's cold reality staring you in the face.  And there are some real ""mensches"" out there who help make it all bearable.",1141516800,3,2905,4.729622266401591
732236,4,6303855512,"I just love this movie and it is an all time favorite of mine. It is a character driven movie and is mostly interesting dialogue between the characters. Harvey Kietel shines as Auggie the part owner of a small tobacco store in Brooklyn. The movie revolves around the characters that he encounters and that come in and out of his store on a daily basis. William Hurt is great as a broken and shattered writer. His scenes with Kietel are the highlights of the movie. The final scene 'Auggies Christmas Story' is touching and brilliant. Forrest Widaker also has a very big part in a subplot involving an accident that cost him his arm and the child that he never knew. Also Stockard Channing and Harvey have great scenes together including with a very young Ashley Judd in her first role (I think).

There is a companion piece movie called Blue in the Face that has many of the same characters including Harvey Kietel as Auggie but its not as good and is more of a bunch of thrown together comedy skits and funny short little scenes but its worth watching to especially if you like Smoke but its no where near as good.",1140134400,2,1115,4.465686274509804

They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

Well you wave your hand and they scatter like crows

They have nothing that will ever capture your heart

They're just thorns without the rose

Be careful of them in the dark

I know your stairs and your doorway

They stay at the carnival, but they'll never win you back...

732240,5,6303855512,"Smoke is a great off beat film that took me by surprise.  I just happened to catch it on cable one day.  For those of you that live in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, you'll love seeing that part of town on film including the ""J"" train as it slowly creeps up the track towards the Williamsburgh Bridge and BedStuy off in the hazy distance and the old Williamsburgh Bank in the foreground.  It's a long lazy shot and I find myself sometimes watching that scene over and over again.  It's a beautiful shot of that part of Brooklyn.  Close enough to hear the train but far enough to keep the other city noises in the background.  Utterly beautiful!

This film is full of quirky characters.  Auggie (Harvey Keitel) is probably the most off beat and quirky of them all.  Stockard Channing gives a stunning performance as Auggie's ex girlfriend and Ashley Judd is brilliant, even though she only has one scene, as their drug addicted, poor and bitter daughter.  The film also stars William Hurt (Altered States), Harold Perrineau Jr, (Romeo&Juliet) and Forest Whitaker (Panic Room).

The most unexpected moment in Smoke is Auggie's Christmas story.  I don't want to give too much away but it's sad, touching and funny all at the same time.  Don't look for special effects, explosions, car chases or gun fights here.  There are none.  Just good storytelling.

Also interesting are the bonus attractions on the dvd.  Seeing the director (Wayne Wang) direct another director (Forest Whitaker) and watching Whitaker accept and discuss Wang's directions were especially captivating.

All in all, a lovely film to curl up with.  Enjoy!",1095897600,33,1616,4.875

The search for a father that turns sour-sweet, sour first because the father does not want to believe the boy is his son, sweet then because after some negociating with several witnesses of the meeting he will accept the idea and come to some fatherly agreement. The search for a father by a mother for her daughter in order to attempt her salvation from drugs and the salvation of the baby she is carrying. It turns frankly sour if not even bitter without any hope for recognition from the daughter and any salvation. The search for some financial success that has to do with hard work on the side of Auggie and pure luck on the side of Thomas, aka Rashid. And the good luck of one will compensate for his negligence that turned the hard work of the other into destruction and loss. And it all ends with a strange Christmas story, for the New York Times, mind you, where Auggie assumes the identity of a shoplifter of his and celebrates Christmas with the shoplifter's blind grandmother and shoplifts her apartment of a brand new camera that was probably stolen anyway in the first place. The film ends thus on pictures of the obvious pleasure of the black grandmother kissing and hugging the white Auggie as if he were her black grandson who had of course forgotten to come and celebrate Christmas with his grandmother, too busy he was shoplifting magazines, or other valueless goods, here and there.

732242,4,6303855512,"""Smoke"" is one of those movies that you'd probably be better off buying rather than renting.  It deserves --perhaps even requires-- multiple viewings.  `Great,' you may say, `another movie that I have to watch a dozen times to understand.'  No, no.  Don't be afraid.  The reason I suggest this is not because the film is presented in a haphazard format (like the double helix-like antics of ""Pulp Fiction"").  It's not because the dialogue is cryptic or scant, the story unfolding with minimal explanation.  And, no, don't worry, it's not because it's so damned pretentiously quirky that things seem to be going absolutely nowhere, reminiscent of highly overrated films such as ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", ""Punch Drunk Love"", and ""Adaptation"": those where ultimately, you learn virtually nothing about the plot and characters.  So why do I recommend that ""Smoke"" be watched more than once?  There are actually a couple of primary reasons:  First, I'll explain why it 'deserves' multiple viewings, and secondly, why it may 'require' them:
1)  Simply put: This is a comforting film.  If you need to be loved or wanted, or just want to hang out with some friends who have been in your shoes and will listen and provide solace...  then this is the story for you.
Compassion is the essential theme of ""Smoke"".  We have a drugged-out girl (Ashley Judd) who gets pregnant, with an alcoholic mother (Stockard Channing) struggling to reunite with her ex-boyfriend (Harvey Keitel) --who is also the purported father of her daughter-- in order to assist Judd's character with raising her child, and to provide a family atmosphere.  Enter next a seventeen year-old boy (Harold Perrineau Jr.) attempting desperately to obtain employment from an amputee owner of a nearly bankrupt gas station (Forrest Whitaker) whom he believes to be his long, lost father.  The boy ends up befriending -the last of the six characters-- a once popular writer (William Hurt) who, as a result of multiple traumas (mainly because of the loss of his wife), has lost his literary mojo; consequently, he is reclusive and somewhat paranoid of others.  These are all seriously confused people, folks.  But as the story progresses --at a pace that is neither hurried nor lagging behind, echoing the pace of the characters' deep thought and introspection, and thus allowing the viewer time to synthesize the consequences of their realizations-- these people become involved with others that share their pain and loss, and they console one another.  There really are no antagonists in this film.  Of course, none of the characters are even close to perfect, evidenced when they engage in some questionable and objectionable acts (never extending the scope of realism as to make them ridiculously quirky, I must add); but the important thing is that they all learn from their mishaps and paranoias, and bequeath their knowledge to influence positively each others' lives.  To conclude why ""Smoke"" deserve multiple viewings: There's a lasting effect that I liken to listening to a comforting song, over and over and over again.
2)  Though the pace of ""Smoke"" was concurrent with the goings-on in the characters' lives, these people are nonetheless complex.  They are intellegent, introspective, and contemplative --and also great storytellers and listeners, to boot.  But complex stories and complex characters both demand a high degree of attentiveness, and as a result, there is a greater probability of something being missed.  For this reason, additional viewings may be required.
For whatever reason, I highly recommend at least one viewing of ""Smoke"".  The acting is highly realistic --even improvised many times during the film, eliciting an occasional chuckle.  Few times have I seen a film where personal highs and lows are so well-balanced.  Then why only four stars?  Well, the improvisation seems to get a little out-of-character sometimes, and the direction is occasionally shoddy.  But overall, this is a great DVD to buy -not rent.",1068768000,7,3999,5.155038759689923
732243,5,6303855512,"Harvey Keitel, one of the stars of this ensemble movie, was often in her early career compared to Robert DeNiro -- especially in terms of ""Mean Streets,"" a movie in which both Keitel and De Niro were featured and which signaled to the mainstream movie world the beginning of their respective careers.
Keitel's star took a nosedive in the 1980s, with many of his 1980s films so obscure and so poorly received as to be almost impossible to locate nowadays via the Blockbuster route or, say, through your local public library.  (Believe me, I've tried.)
In fact, Keitel after ""Mean Streets"" was so unsure hs future as an actor that he went back to his regular, ""steady"" job AS A COURT STENOGRAHER -- if you can imagine! (See Mitchell Fine's excellent biographer of Keitel, ""The Art of Darkness"").
Thus, throughout the 1970s and 80s, the word in Hollywood was that DeNiro was king, hot as a pistol, and Keitel was, well, out of the picture.  Excuse the pun.
To resuscitate his career, Keitel, indefatigable, took a route that bypassed Hollywood!  He began doing indies, independently produced movies, and slowly but surely emerged in the 1990s as not just a major, ""bankable"" star but became,in the fullest sense of the word not just a star but **AN ARTIST** -- accent grave over the words RISK-TAKER.
Keitel can proudly look back at ""a body of work"" -- movies that really matter.
Meanwhile, over in this corner, is Robert DeNiro, who for many people who taking acting and movie-making seriously (as an art and not just a commercial venture) is now seen as selling out, or at least not living up to his 70s and 80s potential.  Not by a long shot!
In short, Keitel is making ""movies that matter,"" working with directors like Jane Campion and Quentin Tarantino, often taking 4th or 5th billing **in work he truly cares about** ... While DeNiro is working with Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller.
Regarding ""Smoke,"" I was so impressed by this movie that I immediately went to the search engine of my local public library and put HOLDS on all the Harvey Keitel movies they had.
And not one of them disappointed me!
Even though some of them were not very well made or else lost what no doubt was a greater-vision-than-actually-executed, Keitel never failed to be interesting.
In ""Holy Smoke"" (not tbe confused with ""Smoke"") Keitel plays a cult deprogrammer and, you have to see the picture, winds us wearing Kate Winslet's makeup and one of her dresses!!!  Now, I realize (and concede, gladly) that DeNiro is a great actor but AT THIS POINT IN HIS CAREER do you honestly think DeNiro would take a part where he's required to wear a dress?  (Note Well: ""Holy Smoke"" is NOT a comedy, far from it.)
Getting back to the movie in question, ""Smoke"" ... Keitel's work with the rest of the cast, in particular William Hurt, is excellent.  Hurt, whose career has been floundering, is like a great basketball player who needs a great team around him to truly shine -- someone there to set up the plays for him.  And, here again, this is something Keitel can AND IS WILLING TO DO  whereas DeNiro not at all, after ""he's the star,"" it's his name that invariably appears first on the marque.  (He gets to take all the good shots.)
There occurs at the end of ""Smoke"" something I've rarely seen done in a movie, and never quite so well.  It's Keitel talking to Hurt telling him ""a Christmas story.""  The thing is, the camera remains on Keitel for at least 6 or 7 minutes, maybe longer -- with no cutaways!  The stationary monologue Keitel has to deliver to the camera should be the final exam for anyone wanting to graduate from Actor's Studio.  If that were the criteria, few would get their diplomas -- and none would do the scene as brilliantly as Keitel.
Put simply: Keitel's work makes you think.  It is in this sense that he epitomizes the artist in modern society -- he is, in short, and nothing less, **a subversive.**  DeNiro, on the other hand, judging from his work, I have no idea of his personal feelings on the subject, has fallen too in love with ""The Midway, The Midway, where burning Veblen loved and lost.""  If DeNiro made 3 mainstream movies in a row that bombed, he'd be dead commercially.  On the other hand, if Keitel made three mainstream movies in a row that bombed commercially, he'd still be interesting to watch, he'd still be Harvey Keitel, an artist.
... And the chances are he'd rise again from his own ashes.
Put another way: if Keitel were to become DeNiro, he'd cease being Keitel. ...
It's gotta be that way.  Or else what's a heaven for?",1060387200,,4542,4.599009900990099
