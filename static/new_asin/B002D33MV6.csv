Education and experience are keys to understanding and unlocking ignorance. This film, and books like Gulwali  Passerlay's ""The Lightless Sky"" reveal the internal and external dilemmas facing countries like Afghanistan and the wider region, with the human tide hitting Europe today as evidence. When powers such as Russia and the US and their allies invade any region on the planet, their governments should think again.",1453593600,,667,5.529411764705882

His severe father is resolved to raise Niaz as a copy of himself--an uneducated gunmaker.  Niaz, though, deeply wants an education and has little interest in following in his father's footsteps.  This film gives a fascinating picture of life in this remote area, and the setting and performances are completely believable because they are so authentic.",1416614400,,479,5.194805194805195

Besides, it is a beautiful story in a society that is backwards.  HIGHLY recommended movie. I absolutely loved it.",1373846400,,266,5.285714285714286

Australian filmmaker Benjamin Gilmour had major adventures making his debut film SON OF A LION in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, an area where foreigners are forbidden.

Disguised as a Pashtun he managed, with the help of the people of Darra Adam Khel and Kohat, to shoot his story of a young boy Niaz - played by the executive producer's son NIAZ KHAN SHINWARI, who is not interested in following in his father's footsteps by becoming a gunmaker, he wants an education.

His father, Sher Alam, played by SHER ALAM MISKEEN USTAD, a Pashtun warrior, a survivor of the mujahadeen insurgency against the Soviets. He rigidly refuses to allow Niaz to go to school, against the advice of the boy's uncle Baktiyar Afridi, (BAKTIYAR AHMEN AFRIDI).

Made under the most chaotic conditions SON OF A LION is a major achievement. It gives wonderful insight into life in the weapons-manufacturing town of Darra Adam Khel and into the culture of the people - the hashish-smoking, the poetry and the patriarchy.

I must admit that a fair way into the film I thought I was watching a documentary, so natural are the performances.

SHER ALAM MISKEEN USTAD is just outstanding as the father, he's beautiful.

All the performers were local people, untrained - it's extraordinary what Gilmour achieved with them.

Gilmour's screenplay was adapted with the local people so that there is a real authenticity. It's narratively strong and character rich, and it's been well directed by this newcomer to the screen",1254960000,2,1571,4.969465648854962
