8572192,1,B00BPDI5DU,"Horrible customer service at the Tracy Anderson website.  She gets lazier and lazier making the workouts as she makes more.  She does something on one side and forgets to do it on the other, she offers lots of instructions on the beginning and then never talks again, the camera focuses on weird angles like her foot so you can't see what she is doing, she moves around into this sort of blurred white zone where you can't see what she is doing, sometimes the workout is incomplete (i.e. arms and abs but no legs), you can tell when they just dubbed together some random workouts to make it look like one continuous one, they also sometimes just flip the image around on the screen so it looks like the other side (right versus left), and she jumps from one sequence to the next leaving you no time to move with her.  Overall, they figured out a way to sell ""variety"" without actually making any variety.",1424044800,,904,4.466666666666667
8572193,5,B00BPDI5DU,"This workout was unbelievably amazing for all the reasons that other reviewers mentioned. Here are a few additional thoughts of my own. First, if a reviewer gave up this workout before the full 90 days, I wouldn't trust it. It took me 4 weeks to see results but when I did see the results, they were AMAZING!!!! And it's pretty amazing that you can even start seeing results in 4 weeks. The changes were visible enough that my husband started commenting more and more on his appreciation of the results ;) After 4 weeks, it just got better and better. And easier.

Second, the results probably wouldn't have been as visible if I didn't also do the diet. A few caveats though. The diet really is absurd and not healthy in that there are times when she probably has you trying to manage on 700 calories a day. I didn't do that but I did use the recipes to help me create a diet that was at least 500 calories less than I usually take in (in order to reach the 3500 reduced calorie intake needed to lose a pound a week). I had several weeks at a time that I would plateau and that would be frustrating but I just kept at it trying to stick to a Tracy-inspired diet as much as I could without going overboard. What did I do with the recipes? I just reviewed how she created the daily and weekly meals and thought about the principles behind it - very low fat, a good amount of protein, lots of veggies and fruits, no sauces, little sugar, no processed foods/carbs - essentially the idea is to get used to tasting natural foods the way they come without all the added stuff that causes bodies to crave and to keep it to a low glycemic index and high protein/high fiber to help with metabolism. Anyway, I'm not an expert in this stuff, but it makes sense to try to stay away from processed things and to get used to normal healthy food the way it comes naturally as much as possible. So I tried the best I could to make at least 1 or 2 meals a day like that. I've lost 15 pounds like that and have maintained it for a year by continuing with those ideas - maintenance is the hardest for most people so I'm pretty proud of that. Although 15 pounds may not sound like a lot, 12 was my goal, so I actually surpassed it and maintained it - I just wanted to lose the post-children weight and go back to my college weight and I succeeded, ending up with my high school weight.

Third, yes, the jumping was very hard on my body for a while. At first I also had very low endurance. I could only do it for 5 minutes. That's it! But I didn't give up. I just kept at it and then eventually I worked up to 30 minutes. Following her got boring pretty quickly so ultimately I just made my own mixes or listened to Pandora and just jump-danced around in my living room using the same moves I had memorized her doing and just making my own up. The most important piece was that I was dance/jumping around for 30 minutes. In the beginning, I would get shin splints or my ankles would hurt or sometimes my knees. I did what you are supposed to do in those situations. If it was during dancing, I stopped for the day and that was it. I came back to it the next day and if it was still a problem, I would stop for the week and do some different cardio or none at all. Then I'd go back to it was I felt better and nothing hurt. After 6 months I had turned to other workouts that involved a lot of jumping/dancing (Tonique, Ballet Beautiful) and I never have gotten any of those problems.

Fourth, I had to make a few modifications for the sculpting workouts because (a) it got boring listening to the same song for 10 straight days and (b) she never repeated the instructions for the left leg. So after the first few days of getting to know each new workout, I would put the music on mute just keeping her instructions on (I LOVE that it allowed for that option) and I would just rewind it to the beginning to hear her right-leg instructions while I did the left leg. That way I wouldn't have to look at the TV while I did the workout - I'd just listen to her instructions while listening to my music once I learned the moves.

Fifth, use the weight and workout tracker in the box. It works. Don't use the measuring tape. It doesn't seem to ever provide any accurate results. At least it didn't really help me much at all. But tracking my progress was very important to me reaching my goals as it is for most people engaging in any kind of behavior change.

Sixth, if anything hurts, stop doing it. Also, watch and listen to her instructions. She isn't the best at explaining what she's doing and sometimes you need to carefully look at what she is doing to make sure your form it right and other times you need to listen to how she describes it to get it right.

Seventh, I did start out doing the whole thing - a little over an hour with the cardio and the sculpting. And I have two young kids and work full-time so plenty of excuses that I don't have time. I will say I probably wouldn't have been able to have time for this without a wonderful husband who helped me find a time when he could manage the kids (right after work - he made the dinner while I worked out, plus I finally stuck to not staying an extra half hour at work doing things that would certainly not benefit me more than an extra half hour of exercise could). The kids were finally old enough to also play on their own for a while or just hang out playing near me while I worked out without interrupting me. But after maybe the first month and a half (once I established a good routine and knew I could stick to it), I transitioned to doing the cardio for only about 15 minutes to keep it to a realistic 45 minutes. I still saw results doing that.

I loved the results so much that although I had moved on to other really great similarly-inspired workouts after finishing the 90 days (Tonique, Ballet Beautiful), I really missed Tracy Anderson's unique technique and the results I got from her workout were never matched by any other. So I went back and bought a few more of her other DVDs, which I didn't like as much, and then finally sucked it up and got the Continuity DVDs (they don't seem to be sold on Amazon, but found them for half-price on Gilt). Continuity continues the same workouts building on them for months 4-12 and then there's another one out there for another 12 months I think. I've been interchanging that with Tonique and just love the results. I have never been in such amazing and slender shape EVER. Not even in HS and college - I am now the same as my high school weight but actually look more slender and better toned. My husband has seen those old pictures of me and agrees and I'v head college friends tell me the same thing.

Perhaps most importantly, this workout was the first workout that ever inspired me to stick to a long-term workout plan. I went from working out maybe 1 day a week (and sometimes months of not working out at all) to really enjoying working out 6 days a week!! And I've been sticking to that for a year now! Perhaps it was just that it was such a highly structured program - what it required was probably similar to what a personal coach would make you do, which is different from what most home workout DVDs involve. I don't know, but I'm glad it worked.",1408752000,7,7256,4.233935018050541
8572194,1,B00BPDI5DU,"I have been doing the Tracy Anderson Hipcentric Method for 30 days now and I cant see any difference in my hips, legs or thighs. This has been a waste of time and money I had better results with a 5.00 workout DVD Save your money it is NOT worth it. I was so excited about this program and I am very disappointed it does not work!",1390867200,2,330,3.9402985074626864
8572195,4,B00BPDI5DU,"EDIT-- I'm almost done the first 3 disc's of this program and I'm debating on whether to move on to the continuity program or try a different program. I'm just a person who gets bored easily and while her workout does change every 10 days it is still in the same format. The results, however, have been really good. Holy abs! I have never had abs in my life, but I do now. I lost about 2 inches on my hips and my arms have noticeable definition now. I did not follow the program to a T though. First, I never followed her diet program. I eat nutritionally, following a modified Mediterranean diet and already feel good about what I am eating. I do not do this program 6 days a week because with my work schedule, that is completely unfeasible. I also had a couple set-backs... I had a concussion (unrelated)that required me to stop working out for 2 weeks so I went back to the previous level to make up for it. Then I got a stress fracture in the metatarsal area of my left foot. When she says to use sneakers during the cardio dance, there is a good reason for it! I stopped doing the dance dvd and started using one of her older trampoline cardio workouts that I found on YouTube instead since it is lower impact. The main reason I am sharing this with everyone is because I want to urge you to be careful and know your limits with the cardio. There is a lot of jumping, which can be really hard on your joints and feet. I also wanted to share that the muscular structure is really the meat of this program. I saw great results even though I didn't follow the other aspects of her program. It is tough, especially the leg lifts, but you will see results if you follow through. It is important to eat healthy and stay hydrated, so even if you don't follow her eating regimen make sure you are eating in a way that will give you the nutrients and energy you need!

ORIGINAL POST

I've been wanting to try this method for a long time, so I was really excited when it arrived. It has definitely been a challenge. The first time I tried the cardio, it was very hard to follow. She doesn't give you cues or instructions, which can get frustrating at first. 5-6 times using this workout, I finally started getting the hang of it. I definitely reccomend wearing sneakers when you do the cardio. I did not the first few times and I started to feel a sharp pain in my arches. It went away as soon as I started wearing shoes. I imagine if you do another form of cardio that you already enjoy, it would be just as effective. Just make sure you're doing 30-60 minutes of cardio on top of the weight training. The weight training or muscular structure workout dvd was also challenging. The first part is arms, then abs, then the targeted hip and thigh excercises. The arm and ab sections were challenging, but I had no problem getting through them from the beginning. The targeted excercises... I think I got through about half of the last two maneuvers before I completely failed. To me, this is a good thing though. I'm glad it's challenging enough that I won't get bored quickly. I also like that the workout changes every 10 days. After 10 days of the workout, I am already feeling that the exercises are getting easier. I swear I notice a little more definition in my arms and abs too. I may edit this in another month or two after I've had a chance to get real results.

I'm not a nutrition expert per say, but I know enough that the eating plan is really misguided. The first week is almost nothing but fruit and veggies... Not nearly enough calories for almost any person per day, working out or not, even if trying to lose weight. There is hardly any protein or fat for an entire week. Then second week is just boring. Plain protein and veggies. I only have 5-10 pounds to lose and am basically using this program to firm things up, not really drop dramatic weight so I ditched the eating plan but am still incorporating a lot more fruits and veggies and some of her recipes into my eating to feel healthier. So in general, the workout plan is good, the nutrition not so much.",1390262400,4,4074,4.322875816993464
8572196,5,B00BPDI5DU,"Everday I do this program I'm amazed what a difference it makes.  I don't always keep up but I have fun, look forward to doing & see results QUICKLY.",1384300800,,149,4.137931034482759
8572197,4,B00BPDI5DU,"For me, this workout delivered on all its promises: I lost weight and really tightened up. The body sculpting moves are absolutely unique and EXTREMELY effective. Tracy really is a genius in that regard. I lost about 35 lbs on the program the first time through, even though I didn't even attempt to follow her diet plan (there was no way), and I couldn't do the dance cardio because I was recovering from achilles tendon surgery. I did 30 minutes on the elliptical machine instead. And I almost never actually made it to 6 times a week, some days I skipped the cardio, but I STILL had incredible success.

 The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is the quality of the DVD's. Near the beginning of the program, some of the DVD's wouldn't play in my bluray player. A couple would play only on my computer, and one wouldn't play on anything. I contacted customer service and they sent me new ones, but those didn't work either. When I contacted them a 2nd time about this, I never got a response. Also, the editing on the DVD's is terrible...the camera zooms in on weird spots like her shoe for no apparent reason, and often you don't get a good view of her to help you see what angle you're supposed to aim for. On one routine, it even skips some exercises and repeats what she just did, and then repeats the whole thing when she was supposed to switch legs. And yes, it's a bit distracting that you can see her nipples all the time, but that's not really a big deal for me.

 I don't have trouble keeping up with the changes even when she doesn't give verbal cues, and I don't find it too difficult to follow. But more cues would've been nice. At the end of the day, this is still the best, most effective workout I've ever done, and I've come back to it because I know it works.",1372032000,10,1785,4.303571428571429
8572198,4,B00BPDI5DU,"I gave Tracy Anderson's Hipcentric a try a few years ago when it first came out. I made it through 42 days of the program before I had to stop since I had so much low back pain. I was the smallest I've been in my adult life, and so (ah, vanity!), I decided to give it another go-round, this time with Glutecentric. I posted a separate review of that set, too, but am recording my thoughts about Hipcentric here.

When I did Hipcentric, I had ordered it before the Body Type Calculator was available on her website. Hipcentric ended up deflating my booty, which I guess is one of the classic signs that you're doing the wrong Centric. Before ordering a system, definitely check out her website so you can be sure that you're getting the right set for your body type.

Basically, this set comes with nine Muscular Structure (MS) workouts, each of which you do for ten days. The MS workouts are a half-hour each, and there is also a thirty-minute Dance Cardio workout that comes in the set, which you're supposed to do each day, too. In total, you'll be working out an hour a day with this program.

Although the Tracy Anderson Method (TAM) has some problems, it really does give results if you're consistent with the workouts! Here are some considerations to keep in mind so you can decide if this is right for you.

* Expect to be frustrated. A lot. I don't understand why there couldn't be better cueing on this or, especially in this day and age, chapters so you can repeat segments more easily. I don't always know that I'm doing the correct angles that she is since the cueing is pretty much non-existent in terms of form pointers, but I'm still getting results.

* When you're on the floor, keep in mind that Tracy has her support leg not off to the side, but centered between her arms. I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it on her blog, and since I started doing this, I've had a much easier time.

* I've found that it really helps to watch it the first time through on a laptop (if you have one) that you leave on the floor in front of you so you don't have to tweak your neck to watch a larger TV. After the first time I do a new level, I then watch it on my TV.

* Since the second leg has no cueing, I rewind to the first side and do it over again, on the other leg, so I have the benefit of Tracy telling me when to switch exercises.

* Count on some time added in to stretch. As I said, when I first started, I didn't take time to strech my hip flexors, and really struggled with back pain. I now take time to stretch my hips after each session, and I have no back pain. Allow yourself 1 hour and 15 minutes total to do all this.

* I find the dance cardio disk to be boring and too high impact for my knees, so I've just been doing other dance workouts, kickboxing, and things like Tonique.

* This is a hard workout! Really hard! Expect to be challenged both physically and mentally - but also expect results if you put in the work!

* Yes, her belief that women should only lift three-pound weights is nuts, but when you do high-repetition workouts like this, you can't lift too much more than that anyways.

If you end up hating the program, you could always sell it on the big online auction site. I did that with my Hipcentric set, and almost recovered the full cost that I had originally paid.

I hope this review has been helpful!

UPDATE ON 5-30-13: After the four-week mark of doing Glutecentric, I all of a sudden started getting really ""squishy"" and cellulite-y. In a panic, I stopped doing the workouts, and moved on to something else. On the Video Fitness forums, however, there has been a conversation this week about how this ""squishy"" stage is part of the Metamorphosis process. Supposedly, it happens about four or five weeks in in each of the Metamorphosis series, but then around weeks 5 or 6, things start pulling in again.

Armed with this new information, I'm going to pick back up with where I left off, but I wanted to share this information here in case it helps anyone else who panics like I did! :-)",1369872000,24,4050,4.310526315789474
