8270103,4,B0018M6IUK,"Lavish production as always from Morbisch. Singing is of high standard. Acting is less so unfortunately, verging on the ridiculous. The music makes one forgive all.",1432857600,,164,5.346153846153846
8270104,4,B0018M6IUK,"This is an operetta central to the Viennese repertory which is largely unknown to American theater going audiences. It has a nonsense plot concerning a military commander who, feeling snubbed by a noblewoman, is unable to distiguish a recently politically imprisoned nobleman from a life-imprisoned public nuisance homeless vagrant when he visits the local jail to dress up a prisoner to play a prank on her. A stylish production, it is worth the attention of anyone curious about Viennese Operetta.",1305504000,3,499,5.25
8270105,5,B0018M6IUK,"An operetta is a copious source of enchanting melodies, mixing together orchestra, voices, ballett and gorgeous theater. But watching and operetta performed by figurants of Seefestspiele Mrbisch is always a renewed pleasure for eyes and ears.
The music of Millcker's Der Bettelstudent is not only attractive, but the libretto is clever and amusing. A jewel in the world of operettas.
I fully recommend this DVD and all other Seefestspiele Mrbisch performances.",1215648000,13,460,5.492957746478873
