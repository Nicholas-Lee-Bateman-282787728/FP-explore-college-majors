8756262,1,B01DL6PBEY,Scattered. through out the disks there are XXX files.  II did not buy the disks to watch that type of file.  The product did not note on the packaging or advertising that there XXX files included.  Depending on the individual taste think twice about purchasing Mad Scientist Theater.,1532908800,,283,4.854166666666667

8756269,5,B01DL6PBEY,"Just discovered more horror madness from Mill Creek. This time it's specifically mad scientist movies. More duplication from other Mill Creek sets but I did find lots of new titles as well...more than half of the set! That really made it all worthwhile for me. The biggest find I discovered in this was the cult classic It's Alive which I've always wanted but have never found! Been trying to get the digital downloads to work which each of these 50 movie sets have but have had little success. Got one of them to work but not the rest, at least not yet. But I think it'll work eventually. Might be just as simple as a login problem. Bottom line, these sets are well worth the price for them.",1493424000,8,692,4.4140625
