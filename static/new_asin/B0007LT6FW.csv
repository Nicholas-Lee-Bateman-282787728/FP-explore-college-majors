8048716,4,B0007LT6FW,"Back in the '90s, in the heyday of home video (and by that I mean venerable VHS), you could basically put out ANYthing with a picture of someone holding a gun in a provocative stance (and the closer the weapon to one's face, the better) on the cover of a video display box and you could pretty much guarantee rentals. (Actually, that's still kind of true these days with the poster art for theatrical action movies and thrillers.)

The cover art for this 1988 shot-in-the-Northwest obscurity is a perfect example of this phenomenon: neither of the guys pictured on the cover are actually in the film, and there is no gunplay whatsoever, or anything that could remotely be classified as ""action."" Man, the guy who rented this when it was the last tape still available in the New Releases section, late on a Saturday night in 1992, that guy must have been totally pi**ed when he got home and plunked this one into his VCR.

This is not to say that this film is bad, or even mediocre. It's actually pretty good, and the description on the back cover of the box is far more accurate, likening the story to ""Heartland"" and ""Local Hero,"" with a narrative that concerns the results of local ferry service being cut off to a small (fictional) town in the San Juan Islands of Puget Sound.

(In point of fact, the film was shot, mostly, in Suquamish, WA, which is not actually on an island, but located on the Kitsap Peninsula, across the Sound from Tacoma. But you could have fooled me - and I'm from the Northwest!)

This production is so thoroughly obscure it doesn't even rate an IMDb entry, and just try finding ANY information about it anywhere on the internet. Nothing! That I could find, anyway. I would LOVE, though, to find out any information about this production, if anyone knows anything.

If it had been rated, the film might have gotten a 'PG' from the MPAA, and that only for a few minor curse words and some (sort of) adult thematic material.",1487116800,,1950,4.544159544159545
