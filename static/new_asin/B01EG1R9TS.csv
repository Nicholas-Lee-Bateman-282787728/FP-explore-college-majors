When you try to make that type of film it inevitably becomes a ""so bad it is bad."" The film was made in Pennsylvania and has surpassed the Polonia Brothers as Pa.'s worst film makers. A secret plan of the Confederacy to makes zombies in Indiana Co. Pa. is discovered and revived along with something to do with Vietnam and a 1968 satellite that crashed with a disc that can be played in Windows.

From what I can tell the director was grounded and wasn't allowed out of his home and yard to make a film or to use any real fire so he just did it there and drew in the fire with crayons. I think the back story would have been more interesting. Was that supposed to be gun fire? The fight choreography was big laugh.

Guide: No swearing sex or nudity. I watched this film over a period of four days. I watched the whole thing but couldn't handle more than 5-10 minutes at a time without becoming violently ill or entertaining thoughts of suicide.",1527724800,2,1094,4.352941176470588
8758431,4,B01EG1R9TS,"Yes, this movie is an independent film, very low budget. But this has an interesting concept and plot. The story can get muddled and confusing at times but who doesn't love a zombie flick. I'm sure zombie nuts have seen worse but this movie isn't one of them. I noticed the reviews were very negative and seemed to be more of a personal attack against the director and stars (they know a lot of info about some of them) so I kept an open mind. I liked it. Glad I got my hands on a copy. I've seen hundreds of low budget indi films, but this definitely is one of the most interesting. I do wish I could have seen more of the zombie beast. Don't always believe all the bad reviews, take a chance on this. Get an unbiased opinion. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster but it doesn't deserve the bashing it gets from the, in my opinion, more personal attack, maybe from rival movie company. The actors do their best, they seem to be having fun, and that's what independent movie making is all about.",1470441600,,991,4.304812834224599
8758432,1,B01EG1R9TS,"Oh my, this movie is some sort of sick torture. It has a running time nearing infinity, a plot nearing nothing, and special effects below the quality of the original Doom DOS game. Not only a waste of money but also an utter waste of time. I'm sure the price of the dvd exceeds the budget.",1469491200,5,289,4.178571428571429
