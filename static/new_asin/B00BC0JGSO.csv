5572101,5,B00BC0JGSO,"What can I say.  If you love these old serials, you have to add this one to your collection even if it is not the best selection.  It is a part of cinema history and for film fanatics, it is a must.  The price is right!",1405814400,,219,3.717391304347826
5572102,5,B00BC0JGSO,What a collection of serial preview trailers we have on one dvd disc! Many of the serials from the 30's 40's and 50's are represented here. Of course the best ones being the superheroes. Captain Marvel Superman Batman Captain America the Green Hornet and so on. Until many years ago I didn't know they made superhero movies when my parents were kids! Most interesting of all are the clips from the first Lone Ranger serial thought to be lost for years. I used to own this compilation on vhs and I'm glad to see it come out on dvd! If you enjoy serials you'll love this collection! If you've never seen a serial this is a great place to start. Pop some popcorn and enjoy!,1401148800,6,670,4.368
5572103,5,B00BC0JGSO,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this incredibly rare collection of the first true super heroes. Brought back many memories of my childhood. Featured here are Superman, Batman, The Lone Ranger, John Wayne, etc. All the greats that made the modern day Hollywood heroes what they are today. I only have praise for another wonderful collection of great entertainment from Legend Films. 5 stars!",1395792000,2,394,5.171875
5572104,5,B00BC0JGSO,"This is nothing but a collection of trailers for the classic ""Saturday morning serials"" as we used to call them in Blighty, as in my childhood in the '60s we saw them with Terrytoons and Laurel and Hardy at weekend kiddie shows at the local ABC (no daytime TV in those days). However, they are as much fun as the films themselves, and if you haven't yet discovered the joys of the Universal, Columbia, and best of all Republic serials, you couldn't ask for a better primer, sampler, or crash course, as almost all of the major titles are shown here. If you're already familiar with them, it's a great way to decide which one to get off the shelf for another look. I even found a couple to chase up. No, it isn't an actual documentary, but let's face it, there's no-one left to interview, and who needs a dry or cornball commentary over the clips, when the visuals say it all? If you're seeking factual information, there are several books on the market from publishers such as McFarland and Scarecrow, but these are best enjoyed when you've already sampled the real thing. There are also some good reviews on the IMDB, and I and others have produced lists linked to the titles. However, the best way to discover the serials is to watch a few, and this rapid run-through the best of the bunch is a great place to start for an overview.

The trailers included are: the wonderful King of the Rocketmen (predecessor to Iron Man), The Iron Claw Returns, the hilarious Batman and Robin (a Wertham wet dream from those innocent times), Don Daredevil Rides Again, The Mysterious Doctor Satan (Republic's robots and Eduardo Cianelli), The Vigilantes Are Coming (featuring a grinning chump called the Eagle), Kirk Alyn's wonderful Superman, Trader Tom of the High Seas, a clip from the otherwise lost 1938 Lone Ranger, King of the Texas Rangers, Perils of Nyoka, the legendary Undersea Kingdom, my personal favorite, Zorro's Black Whip, with the stunning Linda Stirling, DC's The Vigilante and Congo Bill, The Green Archer, Panther Girl of the Congo with Phyllis (Lois Lane) Coates, Jungle Gold, Flash Gordon, The Phantom Empire, Zorro's Fighting Legion, Spy Smasher, Tex Granger, Dick Tracy, Adventures of Captain Kidd, Captain America, Gang Busters, Radar Men from the Moon, Manhunt in the African Jungle, The Green Hornet, King of the Congo, Blackhawk, King of the Carnival, Jesse James Rides Again, The Hurricane Express, cut-price Captain America the Black Commando in The Secret Code, Raiders of Ghost City, Radio Patrol, ""twelve tingling, cracking episodes"" of The Adventures of Frank Merriwell (""Throb to the mile-a-minute action""), Junior G-Men of the Air (""with the Dead End Kids and the Little Tough Guys""), and, yes, the superb Adventures of Captain Marvel.

If you want to see the predecessors of Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, Man from UNCLE, the bionic heroes of the '70s, Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and Knight Rider and The A-Team, here they all are in all their glory...",1389484800,5,2976,4.844793713163065
5572105,3,B00BC0JGSO,"If you like serials and trailers for them I suspect you will get some enjoyment out of this! There are only a couple minutes of introduction, then the coming attraction trailers start, one after another for almost 90 minutes. The only exception is one actual brief clip (with Spanish subtitles) from the ""The Lone Ranger"" serial but otherwise it's all trailers! I had no problem with this because I love trailers and there were actually a few here I hadn't seen before. Serials from Republic, Universal, Columbia & Mascot are all represented here with average quality film collectors 16mm prints being the original source material. The films appear to have been over scanned in transfer to video tape (this is an OLD transfer!) so some of the titles are cropped off, even on an HDTV monitor but you can still read most of them with no problem. This was apparently made for VHS in 1992 so don't expect state of the art modern day quality and definitely don't expect a documentary on the serials. For the price it's not bad...if you like trailers!",1381536000,,1045,4.715846994535519

It is enjoyable for the family and friends.",1376784000,,108,4.45
5572107,5,B00BC0JGSO,"If you are a fan of the classic cliffhanger chapter serials of old, you'll love this collection of trailers for the same. I had a copy of this on VHS and am delighted that they finally made it available on DVD. My only complaint is, I wish there were more!",1363737600,,256,4.14
5572108,2,B00BC0JGSO,"Unfortunately ""Action Heroes of the Cliffhanger Serials"" is nothing more than recycled trailers and a few clips from the classic adventure serials of the 1930's and 40's. I would have preferred a documentary to give a further understanding of this period in film and style of movie making that is fairly foreign to younger audiences of today. While it was fun to witness some of these cheesy clips, there is nothing to give us any insight into this quaint, but once immensely popular form of movie entertainment. At 90 minutes, it seems a bit long and awfully repetitive. If you are already a fan, you might have these movies anyway, and if your a novice, you'll find very little of interest here.
