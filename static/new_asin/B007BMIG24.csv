5073487,3,B007BMIG24,"Cat Planet Cuties is the retitled series Bombshells From the Sky, a light Sci-Fi/romance kind of show that is very breezy.  There is nothing here overly deep.  Some nice fan service here and there, a lot of ears and tails and cat girls, which is the main draw of the show.

Cat girl Kio is an alien from the planet of Catia and seeks solace in human Elis from the alien obsessed Earthlings that are trying to capture her.  A great deal of the show revolves around mundane problems, as well as Kio coming into heat.  That's right, cats come into heat on Earth and cat girls are no different.  This causes plenty of weird sexual tension between Kio and Elis, as she worries about coming into heat for the first time.

A fun show that doesn't require much deep thinking.  The animation is decent and so are the character designs.  A bit of a harem flair goes on as other compete for Elis' attention... the series also wraps up on a positive high point.  A little predictable perhaps, but they don't leave anything dangling, it's wrapped up nice in a big shiny bow.",1332806400,21,1061,4.422680412371134

Visually artistic
Great characters
Great subs and dubs (I think dubs were better)
Great story
Good mix of shonen and shojo genre
Made me care more about this short series than five seasons of Naruto and Bleach

Cons:
Cats (my only real complaint)
Didn't make me care more for this series than the classics like Slayers and Burst Angel

I must say it was a good value with the S.A.V.E. edition, and I even watched a few episodes with him, even though ""harem comedies"" aren't really my cup of tea.  But I did find it to be cute and charming and not the typical brainless fan service that most harem comedies are.  The premise is a bit goofy with anime ""cat girls"" coming to earth from another planet, and living with a teenager who as usual, is read to get a bloody nose at the drop of a hat around pretty girls.  (for those of you new to anime, this action is most common as it is an old Japanese folk lore that a young man will get a gushing nose bleed if he's over-aroused too much.)  Being a woman as well as an anime buff, I find it all to be a bit ludicrous. But its all in fun and it doesn't take itself seriously.  Meant mostly for guys, harem comedies like this are my friend's favorite, and he was very happy with the gift.  So I give it a five star rating and such a low cost you can't go wrong buying this as a gift.",1504310400,3,1086,3.8868778280542986

The Japanese voice acting is good, the characters are fine. There are occasional breasts and bikini shots, but didn't feel all that in your face until the very end, when they're stripping constantly. The boy isn't totally useless, but he's not much of a stretch from the usual bore. All in all, a basic kind of anime. I wish they'd developed the dog and cat rivalry in a more interesting way. The potential was there, as the dogs were already on earth. But that got dropped quickly. Centering on nobody admitting their feelings didn't do it for me.

5073608,5,B007BMIG24,"- Comments: Fan-service intensifies. This is like the counterpart of Dog Days. This is more of a comedy and ecchi. Contains lots of fan-service, so it that's not your thing, stay away from these cat felines. Moreover, this isn't that expensive since it's coming from S.A.V.E.

===========================================================================================================

- Synopsis: Our main character was living a normal life. Until one fateful day, he meets a mysterious and sexy cat-girl. Though she doesn't have any bad intentions, the people that are after her do. And so, our main character's life is about to become dangerous, and at the same time, very tempting due to the amount of cuties he's constantly surrounded by. Tune in to find out how the whacky situations and cute girls affect the life of our ordinary protagonist.

- Analysis: A plain and ordinary protagonist can divide many anime viewers. Some may find them boring and monotonous, or dislike them when compared with everyone else since they may appear to be useless. Others might find that the one character who isn't super cool, smart,  or strong is refreshing. Some anime characters to consider regarding this topic: Yuuji (Grisaia), Tatsuya (Mahouka), Kirito (SAO), Mikado (Durarara!!), and so on. Some of them I agree were cool, but after awhile, it got boring due to how one-sided fights became. Basically, I usually prefer the ordinary protagonist over an over-powered/almost unbeatable one. As that makes it more interesting knowing the character can't just auto-pilot to win. As a gamer, I generally prefer even fights as opposed to one-sided matches.

One interesting and fairly overlooked concept addressed in this anime is that no matter how different one is from another, there is always going to be someone that will accept their differences. This is one of the main reasons why diversity and variety exists in the first place. Moreover, relationships are emphasized in this anime. This may infer to the fact that life heavily involves the social interactions between people and others that they associate themselves with. Examples: friends, family members, significant others, pets, etc.

- Conclusion: While these waifus are censored through most of it, the last episode they include is one of those OVA-like episodes and that one is uncensored. Since this is a comedy and an ecchi, the tone is overall silly, perverted, and light-hearted. This anime is like the counter-part of Dog Days, and if you like cat-girls in general, this will be great.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Contains 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 13 on 2 DVDs for a total of 4 discs. Approximate run-time of 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence and heavy fan-service.

The plot, such as it is, involves first contact with an alien from outer space, Eris, who just so happens to be a young, beautiful, large breasted, sweetheart of a girl who looks (and acts) like a human cosplaying a cat girl (with cute ears and a tail no less).  Naturally, (on the advice of Kio's pet cat) she contacts our hero, Kio Kakazu, a shy, nerdy, nice guy from Japan's equivalent of flyover country, in this case Okinawa,  who ends up winning the nerd lottery because Eris chooses to follow him home, eventually resulting in the designation of his house (in which he conveniently lives all by himself) as the Catian embassy and the increase in residents of said home by seven drop dead gorgeous young females, nearly half of whom are in love with him.

Early episodes involve Kio protecting Eris from various foes: rogue American AND Japanese intelligence/military services, fanatical believers in extraterrestrial life unwilling to accept an alien who looks so ridiculous, and a sect of cat worshipers, with the aid of the Catian mother ship, a couple of Kio's secret agent friends willing to sacrifice their careers and if necessary their lives for him and her, and Kio's crazy uncle Yuichi who resembles nothing so much as a slightly mellowed Uncle Duke from Doonesbury.  Later Kio and Eris manage to turn most of these foes into allies for the final battle with the evil Dogisians (dog people) who have been manipulating events from behind the scenes until now.  A lot of fun is had with various Catian concepts like weaponry that destroys inanimate objects only and won't harm living, which tends to result in unharmed naked defeat rather than death on the battlefield (hardy-har-har).  However, this show isn't all sweetness and light.  More people are shown being killed in the first episode of Cat Planet Cuties than are shown being killed in two seasons and three OVA's of the alternate WWII show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches/dp/B00GS1YP6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches</a>, one of the major characters is so bad ass that becoming a killer working for a government is considered a step up morally, having previously been a killer for hire, the Dogisian master plan involves either destroying all life on Earth or forcing the death of every Catian on board the mother ship in order to prevent it, and when the collateral damage for saving the day results in a colossal mass of space junk careening towards Okinawa, two major characters willingly decide to sacrifice their lives in order to prevent it.  You will almost forget that the primary point of this show is to cram as many bouncing, often naked boobs in your face as possible,...

5073661,5,B007BMIG24,"There are points in every anime that defy physics and logic, however I have never come across one that does it's best to explain these lapses of common sense like this one does. It's a shame that this VERY silly title gets it right where so many get it wrong. In addition to the hilarious antics of the show, at the beginning of every episode, they spoof a well known TV show or movie, and I find that very welcome. Albeit the title takes a little too much time to get itself in it's stride, overall it is very fun and is a Harem anime equivalent of a ""feel-good-movie"". Instead of the standard multiple females pursuit of the male which plays as an audience proxy, the male ""lead"" seems more like a goal that the girls are competing for rather than a true love interest. And strangely it works, since the women are far more dynamic than the ""Lead"" it puts them as the focus instead of only being choices for the audience to fantasize over.

Kind of wish I bought this here first and not iTunes though. It would have saved me $3, but a download and watch first is better in case you don't like it.

But it is what it is, a super sexy show with super sexy characters in super sexy situations and that's the worse part.
This actually fun seriously fun show to watch, there's comedy, there's action, there's a villain, car chases, and the leader (super rich girl) of the cat alien cult, and the obligatory  day at the beach episode with ALL the girls! I seen worse stuff just on t.v. alone.

The series itself is well done in what I have seen as typical fantasy Japanese anime. Anyone who compares this to real world anything needs to get out more.

5073804,4,B007BMIG24,"I watched this on VOD a couple years back, and it's far more fun that I thought it would be. It spoofs many sci-fi tropes and is well aware of itself. It's a harem anime, but the comedy I think is the real draw. Fanservice is great and all, but there has to be something else there to keep my attention and get me to buy it.  I think this show could have done better with a longer series. You can tell that they are trying to fit so much into each episode that it gives you plot whiplash. The main guy is about as bland as you would expect from a harem protagonist. However I have seen worse, and the main draw is more the fun personalities of the girls. Still by the end I felt that there was a lot more that could have been done with the series had it not been rushed the whole time.

I would usually give a show like this 3 stars, but I really like puns and there is no shortage of cat puns here.

I picked this up on sale which is what I am comfortable at paying for it. Anytime it goes around 40% off I would say get it for something fun to watch.",1416787200,,1052,3.883720930232558

5073826,5,B007BMIG24,"In many ways this shouldn't receive such a high score. The animation is fine, the English voice over okay and the plot thin to non-existent.

She is followed by an explorer mother ship from the planet of the cat people (the planet's called Catia - which says all you need to know really). There is even an enemy in the form of a race of dog people. Cats and dogs, oh my.
What makes this stand out is the characters themselves; Eris (cat), Koi (human and other main character), Aoi Japanese assassin and Manami (CIA trainee) make this story swing along. There is just so much energy and a touch of fan service in this series that it quickly became compelling viewing. I wanted to watch something light hearted and upliting and this fit the bill nicely.

5073844,5,B007BMIG24,"This is a good series! heres why

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) One day earth gets a message from outer space saying ""I'm comming to drop in on you"" . When a boy named Kio Kakazu is going to party with his uncle Yuichi. At the party he meets a girl named Eris (said like Aries as in the god of war Aeries) who is enjoying the party, but he knowticed quickly that Eris has cat ears and a tail. After a long night of partying he take her back to his place and lets her sleep there for the night. But by morning his friend Manami Kinjou who sees the girl enter Kakazu's house and wonders who she is. After finding out about Eris, Eris tells them of her plan that she and her race of cat like human people called Catains (said like Cat-te-ins)  want to make a treaty with humans and become good friends.

Pros: Its a funny series, there are jokes where, because of Eris and her catian race not knowing what human culture is like they are always expirencing new things. There are some good action scenes where you just want them to continue. The story is good over all tho I wish they either made a second season or just make the first one longer than 12 episodes. For the guys and girls who like this kind of stuff there is A LOT and I mean ALOT ALOT ALOT of sexual refferences in the show

Cons: I need to point this out because if you NEVER seen this series before, and also you might be some of the those people who do NOT like nudity, this series is FULL of nude women, never the down stairs privert parts but they show alot of exposed boobs from the women, the catians think its normal in most episodes to be pretty much naked or have the littlest amount of clothes possible for women to wear. ""IF"" they made anymore sex refferences in the show and the boys took their offers of sex I swear this would have ""BEEN"" a hentai but it is NOT hentai. Also there are NO catian guys in the show, its all women, like a giant harem with 1 guy (kakazu) along with his uncle (only shown in some episodes) and the rest of the show is filled up by women wearing little clothes

Over all: I like the series but staying AWAY from the sex half of it, I wish the show could have been written better with the villians in it because it never really got into the whole villians part it mostly stays on the women half",1405555200,,2309,4.133630289532294
5073845,5,B007BMIG24,"Heavy on the fanservice, but with a good plot and well done humor.  It's a harem comedy, but it really averts a lot of the standard cliches of that type- Kio (the male lead) likes all three of the female lead characters but shows a clear preference for Eris, the titular catgirl because the other two girls won't admit their feelings for him.  Instead of the more typical route of having him just be indecisive, he's instead trying to go out with Eris because she's honest about wanting a romantic relationship with him while the other two keep insisting that they're only interested in him as a friend.  He's also got an interesting enough characterization and enough chemistry with all three of the girls that it's believable that they'd be interested in him- too many of these types of shows have a boring loser as the male lead.

There are also a lot of clever jokes and references throughout the show.  This is not the kind of show you'd expect to be making a Starsky & Hutch reference, but it does.  It also lampshades the silliness of an alien species that looks like humans except for cat ears and a tail- one character even declares that it's so unrealistic that Trekkies would find it silly.

I'm normally someone who goes for darker anime like Black Lagoon or Attack on Titan but this show, despite being so cute it risks putting you in a diabetic coma, is definitely a favorite.",1405036800,2,1390,4.5582329317269075

Although this is a harem anime it focuses more on humor, plot and action than merely fan service. The male protagonist may own erotic magazines he is not a pervert with a heart of gold instead he is genuinely a nice guy. As for the female protagonists they range from a buxom alien cat girl, a buxom childhood friend and a shy friend secretly harboring a crush on the male protagonist.

The animation, characters, story and English dub are amazing which is why this is one of my favorite animes!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387152000,6,1183,4.733009708737864

But it actually has a deep plotline, beautiful special effects, excellent artwork throughout the entire series, and excellent audio quality, and a LOT of humor, unforgettable characters (such as the crazy uncle I can't laugh hard enough about), alot of which is sexual in nature but only enough to make you smirk.

Cat Planet Cuties is a MUST is you want some high quality anime with smoking hot women! Dead GOD, if all women looked like this our Earth population would be 20,000,000,000,000 by now! Get my drift?",1361232000,,585,4.625

Animated in full HD, this series makes great use of Blu-Ray - the art is very crisp and colorful. Sound is great, and as always, the English voice acting is painful but the Japanese works well.

5073916,5,B007BMIG24,"Think Sekirei with a sprinkling of Witchblade, the action of Freezing, the fun of Demon King Diamo, and characters you'll really enjoy, like Rosario + Vampire. This gives you an idea of the ride you'll get watching Cat Planet Cuties. This sounds like a child's cartoon, but these kitties are NOT for kiddies! Every episode has plenty of bouncy topless fun, string bikinis, skin-tight battle suits (with bells, for the kitties), way too many really bad puns, and assist-droids. These are knee-high robots that take on the likeness assigned by their owners.  Even these little guy's looks are homages to SF flicks. The characters are likable, even the baddies (although the snicker dog-bot is annoying).

Kio, the main character and love interest is a kind hearted but clueless kid that the three main babes are in love with. He lives alone in a large house that he eventually shares with multiple babes, alien and human. No word on how he can afford this place! Anyway, as you can imagine we have the typical humor involved with a horny teenage guy living with a bunch of hot babes who have no problem walking around topless....

The animation is top quality, action well choreographed and fast paced, voice acting perfectly cast, and overall it's a great Anime.  The disc has the UNEDITED version, so you have all the boobalicious fun - with English dubbing.",1359676800,,1358,4.8405172413793105

5073922,4,B007BMIG24,"In 2003, Okina Kamino and illustrator Hoden Eizo and Nishieda would work on the Japanese light novel ""Asobi ni Iku yo!"" (Let's Go Play).  In 2006, a manga adaptation by 888 was created and serialized in the manga magazine ""Monthly Comic Alive"".

With the popularity of the manga series and light novels, a 12-episode anime adaptation was created in 2010 titled ""Asobi ni Ikuyo: Bombshells in the Sky"" and now, the series will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment under the name, ""Cat Planet Cuties"".

VIDEO:

""Cat Planet Cuties"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  AIC Plus+ did a magnificent job when it came to the visual look of the anime series.  Backgrounds are well-painted and detailed, the characters designs and even mechanical designs look very good and plenty of shadows and details.  Overall, the series looks great on Blu-ray.

AUDIO:

As for the lossless audio, ""Cat Planet Cuties"" is presented with an English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack and the Japanese version is presented in Japanese 2.0 Dolby TrueHD.  Because the series features a good balance of dialogue and action, I was hoping to hear a more immersive soundtrack for the action scenes.  A little more use of the surround channels, but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is good.  I did notice differences with the Japanese and English version, as Kio sounds much more younger (ie. junior high or early teens), whereas the English version, Kio sounds like an older teen.  Nevertheless, voice acting is well-done on both soundtracks and the English version of course, has a been more dynamic range thanks to its 5.1 lossless track.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For those wanting a mild harem anime series, you really can't go wrong with ""Cat Planet Cuties"".  As one would expect, there are a lot of female characters, one teenage boy and some of these characters are more well-endowed than others, it's a banal storyline.

In Japan, there are far too many anime series where female characters are all after the one male character and in some way, there can be comparisons with ""Cat Planet Cuties"" to other alien harem anime series such as ""To Love RU"" and even ""Heaven's Lost Property"".

The good news is that the series is beautifully animated and it was able to integrate a good amount of action and not so much focus on the fan service. Also, it's a series that tends to cater to those who enjoy Furry type of anime series.  Cats and dogs with human characteristics, these type of anime series tend to have a strong fanbase.

With that being said, the caveat is that it focuses too much on the political conspiracy and while the Catian's are exciting to watch, the Dogisians were an uninspired antagonist.  Also, I found the character of Kio to be normal and average, whereas ""Heaven's Lost Property"", its main character is a pervert and in ""To Love RU"", the main character is a person who is confused of his feelings of who he likes.  With ""Cat Planet Cuties"", it tries to fit everything in the light novel series in 12-episodes and thus everything feels short and almost rushed.  The ending, especially of what happens to Kio was like an easy way out for the writers to solve the harem issue.

Still, I did enjoy ""Cat Planet Cuties"" and its multiple characters and how the Catians try to get accustomed to the Planet Earth but also the ""heat"" problems that female cats go through to find a mate.  These issues were fascinating and fun to watch but once again, as the group have their few episodes of having fun together, with only 12-episodes, it just felt too short and made me wonder how much of Okina Kamino's storyline was missing from the animated series.

As for the Blu-ray release, I will say that the animation especially the painted backgrounds look magnificent on Blu-ray.  The characters are well-designed and while you tend to expect anime TV series to be soft in colors, the overall anime production by AIC Plus+ was well done!  Lossless audio was good but I was hoping for a bit more immersive audio during the action sequence.  And there are two audio commentary tracks as well as bumpers and textless opening and closing themes included.

Overall, ""Cat Plant Cuties"" well no doubt entice the anime fans who love anime harem series, well-endowed, furry characters and also sci-fi action.  But for those who want a deeper storyline or even more fan service may find ""Cat Planet Cuties"" a bit too mild for their tastes and that there are other better sci-fi anime harem series out there.",1352332800,32,5438,4.920879120879121
5073923,3,B007BMIG24,"This anime is not bad, but any anime exploit nudity to get viewer's attention is lacking in imagination and creativity, that alone will take 1 star off my score, anime should be anime, not hentai, I like hentai cuz I'm a guy but I watch anime for anime and expect anime out of it, you get what I'm saying? -1 star

The anime's plot is okay, but not excellent, unlike (Fruits Basket). -1 star

I agree with G. Himes's 2star reviewer's title, most give 5star for this are probably young, but not necessary, old people like nudity too, and definitely, most 5star reviewers are guys.

I'm a guy but I give unbias rating: Total 3/5

Overall:
This anime is worth watching, because it's ""Okay""/""Not Bad"".
The funny part about this anime is the dog's laughing sound in English, when the dog laugh, change between English and Japanese audio, and you will find the English dub version very funny, that alone crack me up every time.

With all the interference from the dogs and crazy cat cult people Eris is gonna have a hard time mating with Kio.

This anime is pretty good. As far as production is concerned Cat Planet Cuties is top quality. The animation, the soundtrack, the voice acting are all really good. I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c the story isn't very deep and it's main appeal is just the sexiness of cat girls. My biggest beef with this series is the ears. Cat ears are awesome, but if you have cat ears you don't need human ears too. My first thought when I saw Eris' ears was ""holy crap there are 4  of them"". I couldn't get it out of my mind. That's not really important to the show though. Cat Planet Cuties is a lot of fun and I really enjoyed watching it. You might want to check it out too. If you don't mind tons of nudity and moe.

5073929,2,B007BMIG24,"This review is for the series as originally broadcast in Japan.  Since many dubs take great license with the material, and most English VAs just don't have what it takes to not have me clutching my ears to stop the bleeding, I'm not even going to touch on that point.

So, just the show itself...

This seems to have become the standard for about 50% of anime, nowadays (the main points could refer to any of 30 or so series which appeared in the Amazon suggestions pages I've been spammed with)... they are just harem fan-service shows aimed at 13-year old boys in Japan.  They take incredibly good looking female characters, and have the male protagonist quickly surrounded by them.  Something that never happens in real life, at least not until the later years, and usually never for any but the rich, powerful and good looking.
Like others, this not only has severe breaks with reality, but with mature writing AND common sense.  Seriously, the writing of this and many other modern anime are done at the level of a wish-fulfilling 12-year old.  One of the characters is a ""special agent,"" and that's set up even worse than the most offensive US TV series involving any sort of government intelligence agency.
Nearly everything in this, regarding story and plot, grated.  And unlike others who have reviewed this, I actually found the ""dog"" race setup to be awful as well.  Especially, when the one character not only looked like Muttley, but laughed like him too.  That works well for ""Wacky Races,"" but has no place in what could have been a seriously fun anime.  I'm guessing the original light novels were better than this (as with most movies and TV, the books are usually much better).
Yes, the characters are cute and nice to look at... but if you want more... characters with animal characteristics that are very cute, may I suggest ""Utawarerumono.""  Not only does that have a good story, lovable characters, progress and growth... it has it's own internal logic, which this show does not have.  In Utawarerumono, not only is there political and faction stuff going on that mirrors reality (not bad fantasy), there is a very good reason for the characters to have animal traits.  For cute characters and fantasy, I can also recommend ""Angel Beats,"" which even for it's bizarreness touches on many adult concepts and engages both the intellectual and emotional parts of the brain, while the other aspects of the show make it a fun ride... and the music is good too.  Same goes for ""The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi.""  (All three of those shows I would give 4 or 5 stars).

So, for eye-candy... this is good, but for a serious and intelligent anime, you better go somewhere else.

Oh, and a last note... the information provided for this lists it as ""325 minutes,"" which implies 13 episodes of 25 minutes each.  This would mean that if correct, the ""omake"" OVA episode is included with this (one of the rare times where the complete series does not skip the extra episode(s), and really is complete).  However, several things in this series, and especially this final extra episode, tend to be considered more adult in this culture, than in the Japanese culture.  So, if you are buying this for a young boy (not really aimed at girls), and his usual fare is Naruto, Bleach, or (lord forbid) Pokemon, this is going to have more (sexually) mature material than expected in it.  Be certain that you, and they are mature enough to handle it.  If you can't handle a ""nip-slip"" for half a second during a half-time show, this probably isn't going to go over well...",1347580800,9,3570,4.713365539452496

5073931,5,B007BMIG24,"I don't own this set and I've only seen one episode from this release, however, I saw the show two years ago and it's a keeper. I even wrote a review on it for another website. I watched it in Japanese with English subtitles and my only real gripe was that the subtitles skipped over most of the best parts of the show. I must admit that my Japanese is not very good and subtitles are a great way to keep up with a story. The big problem here is that this show pays homage to the iconic Sci-Fi TV shows of the late 50's and 60's that were constantly re-running on afternoon and weekend television, not only here in North America but in Japan and Korea, during the 1970's and 80's After watching this series two years ago, it made me sad to think that I would never see a decent translation into English. They make jokes and references to American TV shows that American Sci-Fi fans know by heart and they make no effort to bring any of that forth in either the English subtitles or dubbing in this release. I was literally horrified when I saw the name they gave this set. I was reluctant to admit to viewing it by this title and even less inclined to recommend it to friends. However, if you like anime, such as ""Gintama,"" shows that go a bit beyond fan service to provide an insight into our modern media culture, I think you will be very pleased to add this to your collection.

I highly recommend watching it first with subtitles. The English dub is like a different story almost. Fans of the original Star Trek TV series will pick up on some of the inside humour rather quickly, however, the real Sci-Fi gems are buried fairly deep. I was born in 1965 and most of the shows they refer to were well before my time. I recommend watching each episode twice. Watch it first and just enjoy the experience. When you are done, make a short note about what you thought about the episode. Next, get your lap top and open the browser to your search engine of choice. I've found, from my experience, that BING is pretty useless for such searches. I prefer using Google, but I believe it is always best to go with what ever you have the most experience using. On your second viewing, pause after names and places and look them up. I recommend going to the Wikipedia for the synopsis of any old TV show you might not be familiar with.

Once you get started, you will find that it gets much easier to pick up on all the old TV references. When you can see the inside jokes, it changes the way you see the story unfold in the anime itself. The subtitles are not very accurate, so check variations on spelling. I could tell some of the humour was simply dropped in the subbing process. When they dub any anime into English, they tend to dumb the story down as much as possible. From what I did see, I would assume that none of the original media culture references have survived the English dubbing in this release. If the director or writer's cuts were available, I would buy a set just for that.

I believe this anime has much to offer, but you will only get out of it what you put into it. Even in English it's still pretty good and worth watching. It's good but it's not a great as it could have been. This is destined to become an animation and media culture treasure. I only hope that one day some dedicated Sci-Fi fan will save a dusty copy from the soft-porn discount bin and give it the English translation it so greatly deserves.",1347148800,2,3428,4.303405572755418

Kio first tries to hide Eris, but Kio's friend Manami finds out about her and tries to spy on Eris when Manami  finds out that Kio's visitor is an alien from space.  Manami tries to find out Eris's alien secrets, but this cat girl just seems to be here to find out as much about humans as she can with her small robot cat people helping her and doesn't give away anything that would help Manami's boss much.  Aoi is a girl who has a crush on Kio and is to shy to tell him.  She is also a secret Immigration Bureau agent with magic abilities to teleport objects to herself.  The show has a bit of a harem style because Manami, Aoi, and Eris all like Kio.  The bad guy is a dog eared woman and her army of dog robots.  Yes it is probably as silly as it sounds, but there is some substance to the story and is a decent show.

5073943,2,B007BMIG24,"I'm not really getting the five star reviews for this. Eris is a catgirl from space who comes down one day to visit. She inserts herself into the life of a bland video loving boy and his friends, one of which is a CIA agent wannabe (at 16ish) and the other who is an item-teleporting assassin in a power suit while being shy as a dove in normal life. Then, start adding tons of irrelevant characters like Eris's fetish-pandering crewmates, the leader of a cat-worshipping cult, a robot, and more.

It looks great, but it's really a bog-standard harem anime with all the pitfalls of the genre and some serious theme inconsistency. The male lead has virtually no personality and does nothing, yet somehow everyone loves him. Compare him to Keitaro from Love Hina, who had clear goals, and the comedy was from him trying to choose one girl while she resisted him and the others wanted him. Eris...good lord, I didn't think it was possible to make a blander heroine than Miharu from Girls Bravo.

The anime I think notices this and the main focus seems to be on Aoi and Manabi with asides on the supporting cast. But both of them are just stereotypes, and different ones at that, and they don't fit. Both start out semi-seriously in the vein of gunslinger girl or other action anime, but then you have cat robots bonking people with mallets and bullets that strip you naked. The whole ""Military one second, shy teenagers the next"" idea doesn't mesh well either, compared to Full Metal Panic.

The supporting cast: well lets say they are there to fill stereotypes. Eris's crew don't have personalities, they have fetish types: the buxom teacher wearing glasses, the lolita, the flat-chested girl, and the leader with bigger breasts than Eris (who is freakishly proportioned to begin with.) They keep adding them into the 7th or 8th episode, like the talisman girl or the first assistdroid, making it kind of annoying because there are already multiple characters getting ignored, like Kio's teacher who desperately wishes for an actual alien race to make content with.

It's well animated, and has a bouncy opening and closing theme, but it adds nothing new and feels bland. I like harem anime, but this feels like it was churned out on an assembly line for heavy otaku. Another reviewer mentions that it explores the themes of harem anime deeply, but it doesn't-it still has the beach episode, (you can usually tell how bad a harem anime is by it's beach episode: Yumeria if I remember pushed it up to like episode 3,) still has the episode where all the cast sings, still has the sexless wishy-washy male lead, still has the mascot characters, still plays to types, still manages to put in maid outfitted characters, and does little new. Even the Star Trek references were done better in Martian Successor Nadeisco, which isn't technically even a harem anime.

So avoid this unless you are desperate for new harem anime. At least it's better than Kampfer or Yumeria.",1339027200,14,2963,4.756809338521401

5073945,5,B007BMIG24,"This is a review of the Blu-ray version of the Blu-Ray/DVD package.  The graphics were very crisp and colorful. I didn't run into any problems playing the disks. It comes with 12 episodes, an OVA, textless songs for openings and endings, and some of the teasers for the next shows.  The last teaser is a ""outtake"" version of the other teasers, so be sure to watch it. Amazon has given it a rating of NR, but the package states that it is MA, because of the bare breasts.

I have watched it 3-4 times, and although the plot line is very simple, it is also a very funny show. The basic plot is that Eris, the cat girl, comes to earth to have fun and be an ambassador (of sorts). Eris is hard to get upset with, since she is so nice and loves everyone (especially Kio).  The more TV shows, movies, and anime that you have watched, the funnier it is. The references vary from the opening segment of episode three, to figurines, and posters, etc. You definitely need to be familiar with Star Trek and Muttley (see him on You Tube).  I saw things varying from as new as an anime that just aired within the last year to a poster on Alfred Hitchcock, the Godfather, and I saw one poster with Bruce Willis on it.

There is action, mystery, comedy, character exploration, sadness and an amazing soundtrack.  I agree with the reviewer who said it was so much deeper than you would think.

I hate that it was renamed for the Western release because many will not look past cute cat girls to begin with in order to see the other wonderful things about the anime.  But those that do will be in for a treat.

I must say that you will be better off for watching the subbed version rather than the dubbed.  To miss Kanae Ito's voice performance would be a tragedy.

It is not a 'dirty' or explicit anime at all.  It is sweet and funny.  It is not for children, but most earlier teens and up should be okay depending on parental guidance (unless cartoon boobies and innocent innuendo bother you - if so, turn off network & cable TV now!).  Give it a chance and I don't think you will be disappointed.

Themes like ""I just want my beloved to be happy."" and other such cliches of harem anime are taken to their logical conclusion, and the inclusion of the ""Dogisu"" dog alien enemies also helps the series stand out. The Dogisu agent is a little smarter than most villains.

Special Features: Special Episode Previews 1-12, ""The End,"" ""Ichika Special!!!!,"" Episode 1 Commentary, Episode 9 Commentary, Textkess Opening Song, Textless Closing Songs.

Art/Animation: 4/5 With bluray/720p the color is vivid and tropical (literally) and is refreshing as a pina colada.

humor: 3.2/5 I admit that there's some nice areaes where there is humor but its more of a fanservice humor than slapjoke humor. its just there for you to enjoy than to laugh at, and I know that many western anime fans tend to...laugh at every single thing they see....

story: 2-3/5 There's no story. If you think there is, you're just kidding with yourself. Infinite Stratos isn't any different either. Another typical harem genre. BUT!

fanservice: 4/5 Now, these catians are very fun and sadly, they probably censored the nudity in the OVA..........Anyways, there's lots of fanservice and plenty of 'innocent' sexual innuendos and we've had cats in heat in this series.

Overall: 3.3-5/5. The show is definitely enjoyable, but nothing that great. But it still passes on my list, it has a nice mix of comedy/romance in it with two girls with guns and a bit of drama going on. Other than that, its just another typical love triangle anime (3 girls + 1 guy doesn't really count as a harem in my opinion, its more of a love triangle really mostly cuz the catian isn't exactly that aggressive or passive about getting the guy.

The price for this package is a bit expensive but what many people don't understand, or rather, many western fans underestimate the tastes and popularity in certain genres and titles. The figures for the robots and for the Cat-ian(s) have been sold out for a while. This series definitely has gained much popularity in Japan and many popular titles in Japan tend to also be expensive in America (ie Fate/Zero Bluray Limited Edition Box or Puella Madoka Magica)

Normally I would say the base price for any series would be from 30-40. 20 USD is like a discount. The anime industry has to make money because many people download. So do your part at the very least and support the producers and the anime industry.
Other than that, say you pay 30-40 USD for the dvd box set and the dvd/bluray combo normally costs 3-10 USD more.

Considering the popularity of this series, 41.99 seems like a very affordable and cheap price. I underestimated the popularity of Zero no Tsukaima/Tora Dora/Shakugan no Shana and they are all sold out or out of print.

However, this dvd box at least has a couple commentaries. I feel this one might actually be in Japanese. I bought Infinite Stratos and luckily the commentary was in Japanese so I don't have to watch or listen to commentaries with 3-5 second awkward silence. I dunno, English commentaries are not very satisfying as compared to Japanese commentaries. But I digress.

Never underestimate the popularity of certain titles. This one will definitely be big, and I somewhat prefer this over Rosario because Rosario Vampire feels a bit jumbled up and trips over the story compared to the manga.

With Asobi Iku Yo (Let's Play/Let's go play, which is horribly translated to Cat Planet Cuties, not sure what the difference is even if both are inappropriate if you think about it hard enough), you really have to get this box or else it'll slip away and you will risk it being sold in very few copies in the future so don't expect it to drop in price too soon, or ever for that matter. I know a good/will-be-expensive title when I see one when I see it.

Similar titles that easily sell at 40 or above (reasonable price considering their popularity) would be: The World God Only Knows/Ore no imouto konna ni kawaii wake ga nai or My Sister Can't be this cute in english, k-on!/k-on!!, clannad, clannad after story, etc.

show has, action, comedy, cute, fanservice and romance.
there is nudity but nothing to crazy though it has lots of breast bouncing and tight butts involved. and a whole breeding thing when eris goes in heat and wants to mate with kyo the boy

Still very enjoyable for the price.",1525996800,,319,4.245901639344262
