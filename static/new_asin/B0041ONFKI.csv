8527588,5,B0041ONFKI,"Reformat the Planet explores a small sub-culture of electronic music know as chip music, which focuses on exploiting the on-board sound chips of computers and video game consoles. If that sentence made no sense to you: dudes are making music with Gameboys and it sounds awesome.

The genre of music isn't for everyone, but this documentary certainly is.  It's stunning... an exhaustive look at an emerging culture that many aren't familiar with or have even heard of. More than that, for anyone with a musical background, the techniques documented in Reformat the Planet are mind blowing; the lengths at which the artists go through to get full control of the sound on old Nintendos and Commodore 64s is amazing.  Custom software, DIY hardware and a myriad of hacks are employed to repurpose antiquated technology that would otherwise end up in an electronics landfill in India.  But instead it's being used to make some of the most original, beautiful music I've every heard.

This documentary is extraordinary.  I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in music, electronics, video games... or just documentaries in general.  It's a brilliant examination of how culture can emerge under the strangest circumstances.

The DVD itself is well put together with lots of extra features.  I purchased my copy through a site called Fangamer as part of a bundle that came with two other DVDs of live chip music concerts, a double CD of music, a t-shirt, silkscreened poster and pins.  I *highly* recommend looking into it if you're considering purchasing this documentary... It's a really stellar package put together with a lot of passion behind it.  Much like Reformat the Planet itself.",1291852800,2,1691,5.046762589928058
