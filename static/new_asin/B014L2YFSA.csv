7414342,3,B014L2YFSA,"I'm going to review what we have not what we don't. This isn't Saul Bass' final cut of the film--it's Paramount's version of Saul's film.

Americans dislike elliptical stories. Yes, we like twists and turns and the occasional U turn in the story telling not to mention the boiled bunny but we really dislike not being told what we are getting. If we did like elliptical narratives ""Blade a Runner"" would be the box office champion of all time. That which most people don't like does attract a crowd which is how how films like ""Blade Runner"", ""Night Moves"", etc. become cult classics. There was a time in the 70's where we pretended we liked those type of films but then the 80's came along and films were mired in the world of music videos for a decade. Yes, there are the rare exceptions to this rule--the only one currently working who can do this is effectively is Chris Nolan.

Which brings us to ""Phase IV.

Phase IV is a problematic film. Saul Bass and Mayo Simon wanted to create a science fiction film that rivaled ""2001"" in intelligence and mystery. The finshed film was gutted  (largely the third reel of the film) after a single disastrous preview in Orange Country when Fox panicked. The studio had the film recut to create a more conventional narrative. What they got was neither fish or fowl; ""Phase IV"" appeared with an ad campaign that misrepresented what it was and, as a result, the film tanked (I doubt that Paramount spent a large amount on the film in advertising dollars beyond an effective poster that borrowed its most arresting image from the film and, in turn, from ""Un Chien Andalu"").

There's no dobut that the film is visually dazzling from the photography of the ants to the visual compositions

Bass' edit of the film has languished in the Paramount vault for ages luckily this cult film has enough of a following it warranted a showing a couple of years back. Those waiting for a home video release or on demand version of the film restored from the original elements have not been so lucky. Paramount has ignored requests and asset management (these are the folks that are involved with restorations of classic films) haven't been given the budget necessary (or have allocated it to other films) . Those at the screening hwve noted that the footage is in good shape and wouldn't require that much restoration.

SPOILERS-The plot as we have it is as follows:

Ants appear to be evolving. They're building great big geometrically perfect constructs. Into what, we're not sure but they are proving to be a threat to humanity taking over an entire valley and pushing the people out. What IS their end game and do they even have one or is this just an example of nature run amok that a hefty big can of raid will remedy? Two scientists (Michael Murphy and Nigel Davenport) are put snack dab in the middle of this. When the aggressive ants go after the last settlers in the area, it's time to sent in the cavalry with that big can of Raid.

END OF SPOILERS

I say all of this to prepare you for the fact that Olive Films has released the conventional version released in the 1970's. It's a very basic looking transfer (and probably from the same high def the same as the Legend Films DVD). The color timng on this film is a bit goofy to say the least. It's not The most vibrant or consistent transfer I've seen. It's almost as if Paramount wants to put this out there so people will stop bugging them (pun intended) to release this. There's very little effort put into this version of the film although the I pressive macrophotography by Ken Middleham continues to impress along with Bass' often arresting compositions.

Is it worth upgrading? That really depends on your set up. It does look really good in its high def premiere and if this version sells well on Blu-Ray it might encourage a smaller label to accept the risk of releasing the Bass cut as is (Arrow Films, Shout Factory and Twilight Films Films I'm looking at you guys) with a commentary track along with a featurette with current interview with the only surviving star Michael Murphy.

That's not what we have here of course.

For all of the flaws of the Paramount version, ""Phase IV"" is still worth it.  It's  clear that there was no attempt to do any sort of digital clean up or restoration. There's plenty of white dots visible throughout the film something that would normally have been eliminated during the clean up process. As it is here we have the raw footage without any attempt to I prove the image. but not much has been done to improve it beyond the transfer. Luckily, the film elements are in decent shape but they do need some work IMHO.

Colors are subdued with some fading. During the transfer this could have easily been remedied.

The original audio sounds fine and it is in mono not remixed or phased to make it sound like its mult-channel.

To add insult to injury there aren't any subtitles which is an odd choice given that the folks this film would appeal to might have some hearing loss.

There's not even a trailer included (which has bits of the alternate ending). Strange.

While this isn't the ideal release for the film (the ideal version would include the original Bass cut along with the Paramount cut and some special features providing some historical context for the film), this is a decent high def release. There will be those who are disappointed in this release and they have every right to be but I'm rating this on what we got, not what we didn't.

Saul would love the cover of this Blu-ray as it is vintage Saul as it recalls his clever titles from the 1960's.

Perhaps Twilight Time,  Shout or another label will gain the rights to the restored version. Write them and let them know you'd buy it again to see it properly restored to Bass's vision just like ""Touch of Evil"" and ""Blade Runner"" were restored.

Maybe we can force Paramount to evolve their strategy with their cult classic titles. Weirder things happened in this movie.",1445904000,21,5970,4.584037558685446
7414343,5,B014L2YFSA,"PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOW: There seems to be a nearly unanimous outcry that this version is the theatrical version and has not reinstated the original pre-release ending, which is hinted at in the film's preview. Having seen the footage on Youtube, I put forward my opinion - the producers or whoever were right to cut it! I've always loved this film in its theatrical version; I love how the arrogant theorising of the scientists comes to nought. In the story as I see it, the ants are in the process of sweeping humans out of the way as they are depicted doing to other predators. To switch gears totally and impose a pseudo-religious hippy-trippy ending where ants try to fuse their consciousness with humans gives the human species too much importance in the new ant empire given what we've seen so far and for me takes away from the awesome species-levelling brutality of the theatrical version. Sure they spare 2 humans for mating purposes, but someone has to toil in those underground sugar mines . . .",1444694400,9,1004,4.7102272727272725
7414344,2,B014L2YFSA,"It having been a couple of years since the restored ending of Phase IV was found and screened, it makes little sense to issue a new edition without the complete film that Saul Bass intended or, at the very least, the inclusion of the missing scenes as an extra. As it has been confirmed here that this edition does nothing of the sort, my review of two stars simply notes that since Blu Ray is the format for such restorations, it has fallen short of doing so for whatever reason. This is one of my all-time favorite films, but these conspicuous absences are the reason I rated the release two stars and won't be ordering it.",1444003200,15,625,4.396551724137931
7414345,4,B014L2YFSA,"Even in its compromised release version, this is one of the few really good hard-core intellectual science fiction films in the history of the genre.  It may not quite be up there with 2001, SOLARIS, STALKER, WORLD ON A WIRE or UPSTREAM COLOR, but it's close: a visionary thought-provoking film, that deals with alien intelligence--in this case at the insect level--and the human race's place in the universe. If Andrei Tarkovsky had been hired by a US film company to do an insect answer to THE BIRDS, it might have turned out something like this. It's too bad this was Saul Bass's only film as a director.",1442620800,24,607,4.672897196261682
7414346,4,B014L2YFSA,"I'd get this for the packaging alone. It looks like the ant is crawling up the globe from the opening credits to It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Thank you, Saul Bass!",1441411200,5,167,4.090909090909091
7414354,2,B014L2YFSA,"Phase IV is an interesting movie that really isn't all that good, at least in my opinion. I know there are fans of the movie. I also know that the original ending was cut from the movie and there were some changes. I watched the original ending and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's sort of like watching the ending of '2001 A Space Odyssey."" You don't really know what you are watching the first time you see it.

I'm not exactly sure where it was filmed but it doesn't look like the United States. The desert area looks more like the Australian outback or somewhere in Africa. It's supposed to be in the American Southwest. I find it hard to believe that with the catastrophic damage the ants are causing that a mere two people are left to deal with the problem. You'd figure the government would make more of an effort. One is an entomologist and the other is mathematician. The mathematician, James, is looking for a way to communicate with the ants. Once again, if they were this sophisticated, the problem should have been taken a lot more seriously. I'm not sure if the ants gained their intelligence from outer space or an outer space intelligence is guiding them. But, whatever the case may be, they are ridiculously intelligent. Did they really need to build solar reflectors to heat up the lab? If they were that intelligent and capable of building them, they could have much more easily dispatched the scientists. I also wasn't thrilled with the yellow poison, yellow ant solution. I didn't know just changing the color of poison would have such an effect. Why not just dye the poison a different color if that was the solution.

The blu-ray DVD was just ok, not great. There are a lot of really nice close up shots of the insects. This is probably the highlight of the movie. But this sort of thing would have been great for a nature documentary at the time.

The acting was average at best. There are basically just 3 actors and a couple of farmers that are briefly in the movie. So most of the movie focuses on the interaction of the two scientists with some interaction with the young girl who escapes the farm disaster.

It would have been nice to have the alternate ending. I'm not sure why they didn't include it but I haven't researched it to find out why it wasn't included.

Recommended for science fiction fans who like man against nature movies.",1460073600,2,2378,4.52093023255814
