even now after playing it 50 times it gets better and better (which is usually the case with this band)
I agree the sound isn't perfect all the time but the guitar playing is just fantastic (and being a long time fan, I know what I'm talking about)
go get this and you won't be disappointed!",1044748800,4,323,4.142857142857143
8185098,4,B00004ZESX,this is a band a lot of people forgot about lots of good music the dvd I have could have a better sound track droped out a lot but it is a very good show,1012780800,3,153,3.4
8185099,5,B00004ZESX,"When I found out this dvd was available, I freaked. Great price lured me in. The performances are superb, not carbon copies of the originals but very good. Laurie Wisefield shows off his considerable prowess as an axe man, amazing. The downside is two-fold: Running time of about 55m/Average sound quality with some balance problems mar what is otherwise a godsend to WA fans. A must have for fans.",995241600,9,398,4.782608695652174
8185100,5,B00004ZESX,I agree totally with the last reviewer. Amazing stuff. There is a new 2001 release of the same show with some bonus stuff and CD one side DVD other side. Available in UK don't know about US.,992649600,5,190,4.162162162162162
8185101,5,B00004ZESX,"Back in 1982 Wishbone Ash were enjoying something of a renaissance,hitting the UK charts with ""Twin Barrels Burning"". This DVD captures this era perfectly giving guitar fans a chance to enjoy the heroics of one of the most underrated players in the world,Laurie Wisefield. There are some real highspots including ""Living Proof"",""King Will Come"" and ""Phoenix"". A real guitar fest!!!Enjoy!!!!",986947200,5,390,5.516666666666667
8185102,5,B00004ZESX,"I've already received a copy of this DVD from another source. I have a DVD player with European regional code (2) but have no problems viewing this DVD. As far as I know there is NO regional coding on the DVD. Why limit the buyers to only US and Canada when selling ""marginal music""...",971136000,5,285,4.296296296296297
