4134925,4,B003L20III,"COCO CHANEL & IGOR STRAVINSKY is a sumptuously beautiful film to watch - all artsy art nouveau decor, almost devoid of conversation, with captiating portrayals of two of the 20th century's most creative talents - Coco and Igor - played with distant but memorable acting by Anna Mouglalis and Mads Mikkelsen.  And there is enough of the core star (Stravinsky's 'Le sacre du printemps') of the 'biography' to make it musically stable.  But the problem with this otherwise tasty peak into the lives of Coco and Igor is the lack of accuracy of fact.  Perhaps that is what writers Chris Greenhalgh, Carlo De Boutiny, writer/director Jan Kounen had in mind: drop a few elements of fact, mix those with a huge dollop of imagination and create a moment of lust and frustration that usually accompanies the public and private lives of stars. Perhaps in their eyes, fiction is stranger than fact.

What we do know is that prior to the May 29, 1913, at the Th&eacute;atre des Champs-Elys&eacute;es in Paris scandalous premiere of 'Le sacre du printemps' Igor Stravinsky (Mads Mikkelsen) was a very successful composer of such favorites as 'The Firebird' and 'Petrouska' and before his premiere of 'Le sacre' was presented by the Ballet Russes under the direction of Diagilev (Grigori Manukov) with choreography by the notorious Vaslav Nijinsky (Marek Kossakowski in a very bland portrayal): Stravinsky would later write in his autobiography of the process of working with Nijinsky on the choreography, stating that ""the poor boy knew nothing of music"" and that Nijinsky ""had been saddled with a task beyond his capacity.""  In the audience is the icy Coco Chanel (Anna Mouglalis) who, still grieving for her deceased lover Boy Patel (Anatole Taubman), connects with the primitive passions of the production.  The film then cuts to 1920 with Stravinsky and his four children and tuberculous wife Katerina (Yelena Morozova) barely existing in Paris when Diaghilev introduces Stravinsky to the wealthy patron Coco Chanel who invites the poverty stricken Stravinsky family to stay in her lavish villa outside Paris where Stravinsky composes while Katerina copies her husband's music and Coco keeps her successful Parisian business  and seeks out her famous perfume Chanel No. 5.  Some history books (including memoirs by Stravinsky himself) state that the stay lasted for only 2 weeks and that the two were simply close friends, but the creators of the film  would have us believe that a torrid love affair occurred under the eyes of Katerina, a lusty sexual fulfilling of a need for both geniuses which ends in Katerina and the children moving out to Biarritz and distance develops between Igor and Coco: the secretive patronage of Coco to the Ballet Russes is supposed to have allowed a new performance of the 'Sacre' with costumes designed by Chanel and re-choreographed by Leonid Massine - the truth of these elements cannot be proved.

So what we have here is a two hour nearly wordless study of the needs of two famous people colliding in an affair but also focusing the world of Paris' attention on new ways of creativity.  Mikkelsen and Mouglalis are terrific if cold, the 'love' scenes are beautifully photographed, and the decor of Chanel's house and all of the costumes are splendid. Gabriel Yared provides a musical score that is based on phrases from Stravinsky and makes for an exciting background for this visual outing.  It is worth viewing if only to step inside the Paris of the time of the two main characters.  Just don't expect solid facts to reign!  Grady Harp, September 10",1285718400,5,3580,4.994957983193277
4134926,5,B003L20III,"The images and the sounds&music are soooo exquisite that I can't hold the ""lack of a typical story and story arc"" against the movie. (I do not care for over the top drama, though I know it can be done well.) This movie lacks this in the story department, there is no ""that this happens, and then she said that and he reacted this way"". It is much more subtle than that. The pure visuals and sounds tell the story, the emotions and conflicts. The actors are part of the whole thing but not the most important thing, which I have to say I do like. I believe they did their job magnificently just because of that fact, that they don't over act, over dramatize everything.

The story is in the background, the moments in the foreground. It is much more a real way of telling a story, the way we experience life, in moments, in significant moments. And their significance can not always be determined/identified by the actions but by the emotions these actions cause in us.

It is beautiful from start to finish and for my personal taste a treasure, that I will enjoy for years to come.

The movie in two words: elegant, beautiful.",1285632000,42,1126,4.429951690821256
4134927,3,B003L20III,"I watched this movie twice at a large theater with an excellent sound system. I enjoyed the first half hour, which presents a reasonably accurate recreation of the premiere of Stravinsky's ballet THE RITE OF SPRING. Everything seemed accurate, and even the actor who played the conductor Pierre Monteux looked as he might have.  After this exciting, even raucous, beginning, however, this movie settled down to a much quieter level which it stayed on for the rest of the picture.
 If you're interested in either THE RITE or in Stravinsky, this movie is of limited attraction. If you're interested in Coco Chanel, I'm not sure you'll be fully satisfied, either. The cover of this DVD pictures her as the dominant side of this affair (we don't even see Igor's face here), but the movie is evenly balanced between both, perhaps even giving us more of Stravinsky than Coco. Even though the cinematography, design, writing, acting, and directing is rather stylish, I felt something was missing. That element is passion. This is a curiously chilly biography of what is supposed to be a mad fling.  Coco is presented as an ice queen, even though she's a generous patroness of the arts, bankrolling the revival of THE RITE with new choreography by Massine in 1920. Her love sessions with the great composer were done with the same detachment as one might watch an iceberg break off of Antarctica. The old ladies in my audience behaved as if these scenes were part of a documentary about penguins.
  One other point I'd like to mention is that the final scenes in the film seem to suggest that Stravinsky ended his life as a lonely old man living in an apartment in some American city, apparently pining for Coco, which is nonsense. His first wife, Catherine Nossenko, lived until 1939, almost twenty years after the Coco episode, and Stravinsky remarried in 1940 to Vera de Bosset, whom he had met in 1921, when they were both married. In addition, Stravinsky's busy life was filled with friends and colleagues such as George Balanchine and Robert Craft. The implication that Coco was a major influence on Igor is probably not true. I doubt he gave her much thought after 1921 or so. He was just too busy.",1285200000,44,2197,4.771052631578947
4134928,4,B003L20III,"This is a beautifully filmed biopic of the steamy affair between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky.  As depicted in the film, when the controversial ""Rite of Spring"" was first produced by the Ballets Russes in 1913,  Chanel was one of the few in the audience who was deeply impressed by the composer's genius.  From that event, she thereafter invites Igor Stravinsky to be a quasi-permanent guest at her villa in the country;  it is there she seduces the maestro.

I wanted to like the picture more than I did.  Certainly the music of the ""Rite of Spring"" - which holds the picture together - is intrinsically thrilling and dramatic.  The glimpse of the ballet as it may have been initially produced is intriguing.  (For the full ballet, I do recommend the recently released: ""Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes"" on DVD.)

But ultimately the story does not explain how the affair impacted either Stravinsky's or Chanel's individual creative projects.  And the affair itself does not light up the screen - it is almost lukewarm.

The quote I picked for the title of this review is the line that shocked me in the film - when Stravinsky quips at Coco Chanel...and wrongfully at that.  Everyone in fashion understands how much of a genius and artist Chanel was.  Indeed the gorgeous villa that Chanel decorated is explicitly shown in the movie. It clearly exhibits the bold, simplistic, immeasurably compelling talent of Chanel.  The film - which I said earlier is beautifully shot - shows the performance in the Opera House in the Champs-Elysee. It also uses historic costumes from the real Chanel collections.

A theme in the latter half of the picture is the impact of the love affair on the neglected wife of Stravinsky who was dangerously ill; the wife's accusations of immorality against Coco Chanel do not phase the couturier. After all, Chanel apologizes to no one for her independence.

Nonetheless, my favorite Chanel movie remains the documentary - ""Chanel, Chanel.""  And as fictional drama, I actually did prefer ""Coco Before Chanel"", a movie most highly recommended by Roger Ebert.  But Chanel enthusiasts wil see ""Coco Chanel and Igor Stravnisky"" ...definitely.",1276905600,53,2169,4.977777777777778

4134943,5,B003L20III,"The power of the camera stands out front and center in this movie about two 20th Century cultural titans.

I would give the credit for magnificent, original, startling camera work to the movies director: the Dutch Frenchman Jan Kounen. As far as the acting, both Anna Mouglais, who plays the haute couture, perfume, clothes designer, and Mads Mikkelsen, who plays the composure, pianist, conductor also deserve accolades for strong performances.

The movie starts out with Chanel already a successful entrepreneur who lives in a mansion in the Paris suburb. After hearing and witnessing, Stravinsky's controversial oeuvre invites him and his family of four children and wife to her mansion. He accepts and off they go to live the bourgeois life at Chanel's. Once there, he and Coco take a great pleasure in each other's company while his wife stands helplessly by in the mansion. To drown her woes, he takes pleasure at being at the mansion with her children.

The storyline is strong enough to keep this story of love, infidelity, passion moving smoothly along to the end. Yet, upon seeing this film, I was amazed. more like wowed, awed, flabbergasted by the movie picture camera work, thus my giving five stars to an interesting story. I would have given four stars, but the camera angles are so intense, for example like in the forest branches twined together with the late afternoon sun in the background blocked by the leaves.

Sure, both Chanel and Stravinsky, were artistic groundbreakers, changing the culture on their artistic whims. Yet, I found this movie more about the art of filmmaking. Plus the sounds of making movies, which Stravinsky excelled at, earning him a star on Hollywood's walk of fame, for composing music for some of Hollywood greatest hits.

Nonetheless, Chanel and Stravinsky are 20th Century cultural icons. And this movie deserves to be treated in its own respect of greatness, as a 21st Century icon: the power of the visual is as pleasing as everything else culturally centered in this film.",1463184000,3,2025,4.997032640949555

4134960,4,B003L20III,"Cinematic biographies of composers are universally destined for failure, it would seem. I cant think of one that does its subject justice. Theres something about the solitary, singularly unglamorous life of composing that doesnt translate well to the screen. Stephen Frys Wagner and Me is pretty successful but its not, strictly speaking, a movie, but rather a documentary. Death in Venice is a great movie and likewise a showcase for Mahlers music but not really about Mahler. I suppose in its wacky way Amadeus was a close to the mark as well ever get to a composer biopic that works in a cinematic way.

In any event Coco & Igor squeezes every drop of slow and arty out of its subject matter, and thus gets high points for the beautiful production and 1920s period atmosphere. Probably the best scene is the first, the recreation of the scandalous 1913 premiere of Rite of Spring, a truly stunning bit of moviemaking. Also kudos for the depiction of Chanels machinations in creating her perfume line. Ironic then that the most compelling parts of the film are not the hot romantic scenes but the highlights of the two formidable figures separate if intertwining lives. Not so surprising, really. Stravinsky was a composer and Chanel a designer, and by all accounts their liaison was a fairly lightweight affair for each. Perhaps appropriately, then, both our principals underplay their roles; Anna Mouglalis as Chanel is icy and sphinx-like and Mads Mikkelsons Stravinsky has two emotions, bored and pensive.

Coco and Igor was apparently a labor of love for all involved, and this does come through in both the movie and the Making of featurette. This doesnt change the fact that Coco and Igor is slow, seems longer than it is, and will tax the patience of even the most dedicated viewer. On the other hand theres just enough juice to please Chanelophiles and Stravinsky heads, as well as fans of Masterpiece Theatre fare.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

'Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky' is worthwhile for some sumptuous visuals and great Stravinsky music, as well as some excellent additional music by Gabriel Yared. The film begins quite nicely with a depiction of the original Paris performance of Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring' in 1913. That performance of course was considered scandalous at the time, not only for the iconoclastic rhythms introduced by Stravinsky but also for Diaghilev's frenzied choreography. At the performance is Coco Chanel, the famed designer, who admires the piece despite the derision from most of the clueless 'bourgeoisie' in the audience.

Flash forward seven years and Stravinsky, his wife and children, have fallen on hard times. In steps Chanel who offers to put them up at her estate in the suburbs of Paris. At first Stravinsky declines but changes his mind after he realizes that the fresh suburban air would be good for his wife, who suffers from what appears to be pneumonia.

The rest of the Coco and Igor narrative is rather predictable. Coco, the free spirit that she is, seduces Stravinsky, and makes love to him frequently, as the rest of the family enjoys the good meals and gifts, the designer magnate bestows upon them. Eventually (wouldn't you guess), Stravinsky's wife falls into despair as she becomes quite aware that Igor has strayed into the arms of Ms. Chanel. Historically, this all plays out for approximately nine months until May of 1921, when the wife and children left (and Stravinsky soon followed).

There are some rather perfunctory sex scenes between Chanel and Igor with the great composer uttering the best line to Chanel that she's not an artist but rather a ""shopkeeper."" This is probably the worst thing you could say to someone like Chanel, who suddenly loses all interest in Stravinsky and gives up on him as a lover. Nonetheless, Chanel remained generous toward Stravinsky, bankrolling a new production of the 'Rite of Spring' and remaining friends with him, in the years to come.

The implication here is that somehow Coco Chanel was a muse for Stravinsky which is not borne out by any evidence. The entire narrative is based on a fictional book entitled 'Coco and Igor', inspired by Coco Chanel's claims that she had an affair with Stravinsky. This was disputed by Stravinsky's second wife as well as his long-term assistant.

Chris Greenhaigh, who wrote both the screenplay and the novel it was based on, also throws in an irrelevant sub-plot about how Chanel goes about coming up with her famous fragrance, 'Chanel No. 5'. It's a pointless aside due to the lack of conflict (Chanel has meetings with her chemist, sniffs various experimental fragrances, and finally decides on her final pick). Voila!

What's much more interesting about Chanel is completely left out in this film. That of course is that she had a long relationship with an anti-Semitic British aristocrat, was probably (more often than not), a Nazi sympathizer during the war, may have been a Nazi spy and aided a Nazi war criminal after the war.

'Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky' details a footnote in the career of a great composer. We're asked to get excited about this imagined relationship and I'm not sure why. I get the idea that Chanel and Stravinsky were sexually attracted to one another. And that's about all I get from Greenhaigh's speculations.

Anna Mouglalis is quite good as Chanel but Mads Mikkelsen (the Danish actor who was cast perfectly as a man falsely accused as a pedophile in 'The Hunt'), seems much too stiff as Stravinsky (the great composer was known to be quite a social, genial soul).

I would recommend 'Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky' mainly for the look and feel of the visual and musical aspects of the production. But I remain unconvinced there's enough drama here to sustain one's interest for a full 119 minutes.",1413504000,3,3905,4.919452887537994

Chanel did couture and Stravinsky did music, but neither made much of a mark on the other.  How could they?  They were a couple of megalomaniacs. So, it's not clear to me why anyone would try to write a love story about two people who didn't love one another.

  On the DVD there's a short movie; 'The Making of Coco and Igor', which is instructive.  We see the actors and film makers having a heck of a time trying to figure out what this movie is about and why they are making it.  And not finding out.

Even less sophisticated people would have talked more. In this sense and others the characters were just not developed.  One got the impression that the filmmakers were over their heads in trying to get into the characters. So we are left with an affair between two famous people in a beautiful setting.

Okay.",1326326400,,644,4.783783783783784
4135086,3,B003L20III,"This is an uneven film at best.  The first scene is absolutely amazing: the premiere of 'Rite of Spring' and the ensuing minor riot it provoked.  We see an uncomfortable Stravinsky and a somewhat intrigued Coco Chanel in the audience.  The audience begins booing, hissing, and several fist fights ensue.  This all really happened, though to what degree is uncertain.  But it is moments like this that make this film worthy of viewing.  It is generally historically accurate, though I am sure there is a lot of artistic license taken with the interpersonal relationships.  Stravinsky never admitted to having an affair with Coco Chanel, even though she did own up to her part in a conversation with her biographer.

So the film revolves around Coco Chanel's strange attraction to Igor Stravinsky. We see that she is fascinated by his misunderstood creativity.  Perhaps she sees something of herself in him?  Or perhaps the picture of the mystery man shown partway through was a lover of hers that died (I haven't read her bio, but I think someone told me that was the case).  For whatever reason, she comes across Stravinsky at a party and invites him for a meeting.  She then offers to put up the starving artist and his family at her estate near Paris.

The reason I gave three stars is because the film shows really brilliant flashes of genius, only to then trudge on, unfeeling and awkwardly for awhile before another scene of genius.  The acting is generally good, though uneven.  The actor playing Stravinsky does a good job of seeming 'pained' or torn between his two lives.  He does spout off a few spiteful remarks later that I felt were rather childish and not in keeping with his real life persona.  The actress who plays Coco is pretty average in this role, though the writing is very good at depicting her as independent and unapologetic.  She is even confronted by Igor's wife and we see she has no guilt or remorse.

I did find it interesting that they included scenes where she chose the fragrance for her most famous and enduring creation: No. 5.  It is pretty accurate, though they never really touched on the fact that 5 had always been somewhat of a lucky number.  So when she was told the sample was from #5, she felt it fate in a way.  (Note that she used to release her new fashion lineup on May 5th every year: 5/5 - and this was before the perfume).

Though I liked the inclusion of this scene, I did feel it took a dramatic departure since the film is Igor and Coco and is supposed to focus on their relationship and those events and people closely related to.  I felt the focus wavered a bit.  Then the film seemed to drag on for a bit before finally tying everything up nicely.  Though one little afterthought: I did like that the Russians actually spoke Russian and then many spoke French, though with heavy Russian accents.  I like that they used Russian actors and not French actors and had everyone speaking fluent and flawless French throughout (in America we would have just had everyone speaking American you know).

All in all it is a good film with some nice settings, wonderful costumes, and often clever directing that shows promise that never really comes to fruition.  These scenes of brilliance, such as Stravinsky bashing the song out on the piano while drunk, or when he is tormenting himself writing a piece and we see the struggle; these are the flashes of brilliance in an otherwise okay film.  Also, there is some partial nudity, so just be warned if you have any issues with that.",1323820800,2,3528,4.634460547504026

4135088,4,B003L20III,"I thoroughly enjoyed Coco & Igor.  While I am sure the producers took some, perhaps many liberties on depicting just what went on with Coco and Igor, still, the overall play of the movie was both entertaining and thoughtful.  It was really something to 'Go back' and be a part of that 1913 audience who first experienced ""Rites"" and how they reacted so disturbingly to a new way of 'laying it down'.  I, for one, would have been yelling loudly.. BRAVO - BRAVO, For 'Rites' is without a doubt, one of the greatest works of musical art ever written.

The acting was great by both of the principles. The actress skillfully brought forth the realistic flair and yet coolness that apparently drove the personality of Ms Chanel.  The actor playing Igor demonstrated throughout the movie the intensity that obviously drives and circles within an artist of his caliber.  Overall, the movie is a very good watch, however, I would have liked to see more of the updated 1920 performance of 'Rites' than was shown.",1305504000,,1002,4.7298850574712645
4135089,3,B003L20III,"It seems that Coco & Igor is more a beautifully imagined story than it is a biography.  The movie is based on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/B003VWC4EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;that presumed a relationship between them during his time in Paris in 1920.  The only problem is that Igor Stravinsky seems like little more than a ""boy toy"" played between Coco and his deeply jealous wife, Katerina.  The women in this movie are by far the most captivating to watch, while Mads Mikkelsen pretty much plays Stravinsky like a rube, at least when it comes to affairs of the heart.

I won't hold this against Mads, because I have enjoyed him in other movies, but he seems clearly miscast as Stravinsky, right down to his heavy Russian accent.  If you are going to invite Yelena Morozova to play Katerina, why not invite Oleg Menshikov or Vladimir Mashkov to play Stravinsky. Much better for a Russian actor to speak with a heavy French accent than it is to have a Danish actor struggle with two languages.

As a film, Coco & Igor is beautiful to watch.  It plays out like a sonata, with sparse dialog, conveying much less than do the impeccable sets, lighting and clothing that take you back to 1920. This is after Coco became Chanel and had established her House and was scrutinizing what would become her famous perfume.  The camera soaks up every detail right down to the art deco etchings on Stravinsky's brandy snifter as he works out the final revisions to his Rite of Spring, which had been so badly received before the war. That he owed any debt of gratitude to Coco Chanel for this is highly unlikely, but it would be nice to think so.",1300406400,8,1706,4.919860627177701

4135091,1,B003L20III,"So here's the story in a nutshell: Igor Stravinsky writes ""The Rite Of Spring."" It's panned by critics, but Coco Chanel likes it. Seven years later they meet again and she invites him to live at her house so he can get back to composing. Igor and his wife and kids move in. Hilarity ensues! You see, the youngest boy, played by an unknown actor who closely resembles an Uncle Buck era McCauly Culkin, likes to play practical jokes on the hapless servant staff, while daughter Ludmilla writes goth poetry in her diary about how ""nobody understands me!"" And did I mention their lovable dog Skamps? He drives Coco nuts when he tears up all of her skeins of jersey!

No, actually, I made all that up. Sounded riveting, didn't it? Unfortunately, this DMV waiting line of a movie is anything but exciting. It's a long and grueling waste, where a pair of boring, broken jellyfish flail incoherently and languorously in between uninspired soft-core porno scenes. My suspension of disbelief hasn't been this absent from a film since I re-watched the He-Man / She-Ra Christmas Special as an adult. I was incapable of accepting that the people I was watching on the screen could be good at anything other than awkward glances, stilted dialogue and vegetable-like body language, let alone be globally renowned virtuosos and savants. For Pete's sake, even their sex was uninteresting!

Coco Chanel was a genius who revolutionized the fashion industry by taking unorthodox approaches to her craft.

Igor Stravinsky was a genius who revolutionized musical composition by taking unorthodox approaches to his craft.

The people who made this movie are trite hacks, using goofy film tricks, teen drama level narrative and non-linear ""art school"" edits in a feeble and misguided attempt to pass off a dumb screenplay as fine art. How do you mess up making a movie about two world famous masters of their craft so badly? How do you make people who were so vibrant and intense and productive seem so utterly drab and useless? How do you miss so thoroughly the point of the subject matter, that the uniqueness of beauty lies not in its flourishes, but in the burning furnace of its core?",1292112000,16,2165,4.827493261455525
4135092,5,B003L20III,"I saw this film six times.  I obviously loved it not because it was some sort of ""biopic,"" which it was not, but because it was a film using known people in a made up situation that created a powerful story about art, craft, passion and creativity.  From what I could find out, almost nothing in the film except the names of the characters had anything to do with fact.

I thought the best way to understand the film and the problematic ending was to see it as a study of two different types of creative artists each using the other's passion to discover something about his/her own work.  In the meantime the contrast between the old style of life (Katia) and the new style (Coco) effectively showed the necessity of generosity as the basis for the modern.  The film seemed to me to be a feminist statement of the influence of women on a fairly stodgy male whose creativity was dependent first on his wife and then on the passion he felt with Coco.  It was the women, both of them, who made him the voice of the modern at the end of the film, but it was Coco's sacrifice of her passion (although Igor made it easy by calling her a ""shopkeeper"")that allowed him to triumph in the second performance of the ""Rite"" nine years later.  Her appearing in the costume she had designed for the sacrificial victim signaled her sacrifice to art.

I particularly liked the sly way the actress who played Katia showed her superiority to Igor.  She nods slightly to her son who then checkmates Igor at chess.  She is very aware of her place in his creativity and success.  Yet, she represents Old Russia whose voice in exile can no longer be heard.

It is true that the real Igor gave the real Coco the icon seen in the film.  She did keep it on her mantle, and it is true that he and his family stayed at Coco's manor for two years, but he worked on Pulchinella, a neo-classic work, not a revision of the ""Rite.""  It is not clear what happened between them. At the time Coco was involved with another Russian emigre.

So, by looking at the film as a powerful statement of artistic process and creativity, of passion and feminine superiority, of the conflict between the old and the new, and the necessity of generosity as the glue that makes the future possible, the film becomes a stunning work of art in itself.",1291852800,10,2301,4.40661938534279
4135093,3,B003L20III,"Gabrielle Bonheur ""Coco"" Chanel, the French fashion designer who was a pioneer of fashion during the 20th Century and the founder of one of the world's most noticeable brands....Chanel.

Igor Stravinsky, the Russian composer, pianist and conductor who is known as being one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th Century.

What do these two have in common aside being influential and important to their respective careers and industry?  The two also were romantically linked together, albeit having an affair with each other.

And thus, the affair is documented in the biopic ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"", a film written and based on the novel ""Coco & Igor"" by Chris Greenhalgh and directed by Jan Kounen (""Renegade"", ""Doberman"", ""Darshan: The Embrace"") and will be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.

Earlier this year, we had the chance to see another Coco Chanel biopic ""Coco avant Chanel"" from Sony Pictures Classics starring Audrey Tautou as Gabrielle, in her earlier years as she and her sister tried to survive from poverty by taking whichever  job they can and we saw how Gabrielle became a fashion designer and found love in Arthur ""Boy"" Capel, a man that she had loved but a love that would end in tragedy and would streamline Chanel's focus into her fashion line and make her one of the most powerful women in France.

""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" establishes the timeline of when Coco Chanel first met the composer Igor Stravinsky and how the two became close.

VIDEO:

""Coco Chanel  & Igor Stravinsky"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely magnificent.  Cinematographer David Ungaro did a fantastic job with the camera work in capturing the lifestyle and decor of Coco Chanel's home (indoors and outdoors) and store.

The shots of ""The Rite of Spring"" was well-choreographed and featured remarkably well on film.  Also, the clothing of Coco Chanel and the overall lighting that accentuates the shadows on both Coco and Igor's body, there was a lot of creativity and planning in getting these shots and it shows.

Skin tones are natural, there is a fine layer of grain and blacks are nice and deep.  Picture quality for ""Coco Chanel  & Igor Stravinsky"" is awesome.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Audio is crisp and clear.  Dialogue is clear, to the touch of the piano keys, the music, the horse galloping and even the love making scenes, these come through crystal clear through the front channels and surround channels.

The scene that will catch people's attention is the first 20-minutes of the film when we watch the riot at ""The Rite of Spring"".  Not only is the music wonderful but you get a good amount of crowd ambiance as well.

Subtitles are presented in English, French and English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" is an interesting and visually appealing film.  It's a film where dialogue is not so much the importance, but how two powerful individuals, with a similar, cold style are able to find an attraction to each other.  But at the same time, how both are amoral as they do what they feel is right, even if it make people who are dear to them, suffer.

And this is where I have a difficult time with the film and trying to find out what is fact and what is fiction.  Did these two really care for each other?  Was it a one-sided love?  I've read about Stravinsky's relationship with his wife, about him being a philanderer and how he found love with Vera de Bosset.  But there is not many details on his relationship with Coco Chanel, mainly that the two had a sexual affair when he (along with his family) were living with Coco Chanel.

It is well-documented that Coco Chanel was an independent woman, we know that she was a different person after the death of her beloved ""Boy"", but I often wonder if ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" paints Coco as this desirable woman that men just want, but she is not the type to give back emotionally.  In some ways, she is portrayed as a cold-hearted vamp that can care less of what she is doing.  She is completely amoral of her sexual liasons and affairs, even during a scene when confronted by the wife of Stravinsky.  But was Coco Chanel, this bad?  Was she this cold?  Did both of these individuals really care for each other up to their elder years?

These thoughts ran through my head as my experience watching ""Coco avant chanel"" (Coco Before Chanel) was much more positive as we see Coco in various emotions but in this film, Coco had an air about her that was very cold and times, uncaring.  She did what she wants, she said what she wants and I suppose the death of Arthur ""Boy"" Capel changed her forever.

But despite of Coco's demeanor in the film, whether is accurate or not, I will say that ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" was entertaining.  The first 20-minutes is dedicated to ""The Rite of Spring"" and I believe this may be the first film that tried to recreate the famous classical riot on film.  It was an exciting musical piece and very enjoyable to watch and something you just will not find in American cinema (as the first 15 minutes, many filmmakers try to establish the story), for this film, the actual story starts after those 30-minutes or more later when Stravinsky and his family move to Coco's home.

And this is where the film becomes visually driven.  The placement of the characters, the lighting that accentuates the bodies of Coco and Igor and you can tell that the film really focused on camera placement and showcasing the affection both Coco and Igor had for each other. Meanwhile, each time the film switched over to Katerina, we are greeted with a sickly woman who knows her husband has been with another woman. The cinematography was fantastic but the storyline was average.  One should know who Chanel and Stravinksy were before watching this film, one should read up on these individuals.  Otherwise the film makes you think that these two people, who may be successful in their own respective fields, both are flawed, amoral, self-indulgent individuals.

I am not sure if the film is cinema hyperbole but I have a hard time believing how this sexual affair ended in the war of words between both Chanel and Stravinsky.  And for me, after watching ""Coco avant Chanel"", I had a hard time believing that ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" is more pleading a case of verisimilitude.

So, there are things about the film that I did enjoy.  David Ungaro's artistic cinematography, the remaking of ""The Rite of Spring"" and the events that took place on that day in 1913, I felt the set design and costume design were wonderful and I also felt that Anna Mouglalis, Mads Mikkelsen and Yelena Morozova have done a wonderful job but the overall plot seems a bit trite.  Also, it's important to note that after the credits are over, there is another scene in the film that should not be missed but perhaps their should have been some mention in the film to those not familiar with Coco Chanel of how much ""Boy"" meant to her and why she would never ever have any major connection (let alone be married) to another man in the same manner.  It would of helped with the overall storyline and helped people understand that final scene at the end of the credits.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture and audio quality are very good, the special features are a little lacking in this Blu-ray release but you do get the 20+ minute making-of featurette.

Overall, ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky"" is a visually appealing film but whether or not this biopic is indeed factual, I don't know.  While some parts of the film are beautiful and entertaining, I felt the film lacked any major stage of fulfillment.  It just kept going and going until its done.  The film is not great but nor is it bad, for the most part, its an average film at best.",1287619200,4,8443,4.724538619275461

8399285,5,B003L20III,"Fascinating movie.  I heard about Igor's failed ""Rite of Spring"" kick off performance years ago... to see it actually portrayed was worth the price of the movie.  Costumes, period furniture, outfits... so good.  Recommended.",1509840000,,224,5.529411764705882

8399287,3,B003L20III,"In 2010, the present reviewer saw the film, ""Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky,"" and thought the opening segment, regarding the 1913 premi&egrave;re (which sparked a famous riot) of ""Le sacre du printemps"" was worth the price of the ticket. It recreates Vaslav Nijinsky's astonishing choreography (and Nicolas Roerich's brilliant designs) to great effect, and is terribly beautiful, frightening, and intense.

None of the actors resemble the actual characters (especially Nijinsky), and the Danish actor who portrays Strawinsky gives a deathly dull performance. The theme of the film is the adulterous affair between the composer and the couturi&egrave;re. One can safely leave after the ballet segment.",1502928000,,699,5.6571428571428575
8399288,3,B003L20III,Too much story for a short film. There was lust between them but not enough character development to see any passion build. Perhaps it was just her desire to have sex without emotional bonds. Perhaps I missed in the subtitling how long this liaison lasted too along with other subtleties. FYI - I would say this is X rated since there are a few depictions of naked people having sex.,1501372800,,383,4.485714285714286
