1844184,3,B00008G72P,"This 2-disk history of the life and times of Woodrow Wilson is well-intended but flawed.  The producers and writers spend way too much time on Wilson's pre-presidential career and provide a swift account of his presidential terms that leave more questions unanswered than not.  There's too much emphasis on Wilson as a ""passionate man""--so much that sometimes the biofilm feels uncomfortably like a gossipy video celebrity column.  A lot of time is spent on Wilson's health, certainly an important issue but not deserving as much attention as it gets.

What's the opportunity cost of all this?  Three come immediately to mind.  First, although we're told that Wilson was a ""progressive"" candidate for the governorship of new Jersey and, afterwards, the White House, we're not given any good idea of what it meant to be a ""progressive.""  All that we're told is that progressives felt that there was an oligarchy oppressing the working class,  Second--and this, I think, is the single biggest failing of the film--the film in no way tries to account for the gross discrepancy between Wilson's ""progressivism"" and his endorsement of what was arguably the worst assault on civil liberties in this country's history.  How could a president who preached the almost transcendental value of democracy agree to the Espionage and Sedition Acts which imprisoned or exiled thousands of people?  Third, the film mentions Wilson's 14 Points, but says nothing about what they were--except for the last one, calling for the establishment of a League of Nations.  What a bizarre oversight!

The upshot is that we learn a lot from the film about Wilson's private life but next to nothing about his intellectual life or his public policy positions.  Disappointing.",1224720000,10,1745,5.1453900709219855
1844185,3,B00008G72P,"This is a very worthy documentary on an unusually important President. I like the way in which Wilson the lecherous academic (an understudied type) is described as a man of passion towards women, and openly laughed when his visit to one woman was described as ""we don't know how far he went with her - from what we know of him, probably very far"". There is also a lot of stalking about by a man in glasses - or is this the actual Wilson (did they have colour movies in 1912)?

One interesting question temporarily raised in the movie concerned how an academic in his ivory tower could handle some of the most corrupt politicians in America. One answer not given is Wilson's own - that his own experience of academic politics made the New Jersey bosses appear to him as mere amateurs.

This film raises all sorts of historical questions in an interesting set of side-movies attached to the main documentary, though they are only brief (how come La Follette never gets a mention?) But you get the sense of a film made for schools. A turbulent period of American history passes before our eyes, but as in a school lesson disturbing questions are not raised.

Did Wilson's earlier political ideas play a role in his political activity? All you get is a brief comment that Wilson's early writings show his concern for a greater role for the State. So why wasn't he a Bull Moose progressive like Roosevelt? Having said that, the programme does bring out the political differences between Wilson and Roosevelt in 1912. Perhaps this indicates that Wilson's writings on The State were therefore more complex? You wouldn't find out here, any more than you would find out in a school textbook.

Why did a progressive like Wilson preside over a period of imperial expansion which would have been described as dollar dilplomacy under his predecessors? Does it have any connection with the Wilsonian vision of the neo-cons of today??

A Red Scare, with its roots in wartime hysteria, is shown as in a US History textbook; but wasn't Wilson, who presided over the worst excesses in the abuse of civil rights in US history, seen as a great progressive President? What is this Progressivism, which can launch social reform while having people arrested merely for saying openly that the war was being fought for profits?

You'll never find out by reading a US History textbook for schools. And you'll never find out by watching this documentary (honourable exception - the appearance by historian Walter la Feber).

Ouch, a lot of work went in this documentary..I can tell, and the makers will hate me if they ever read this. But a lot of work goes into textbooks. Still as dull as ditchwater.",1149465600,14,2675,4.727467811158799
1844186,5,B00008G72P,"This open my eyes to a president that no one would suspect had as much impact on the way we live today. I think that the fact he openly had a mistress,explains it is the media's focus on an everyday experience can change the top office's impact(Bill Clinton)).There is too much to describe here rent it,buy it ,it is a must see. He wanted the League of Nations,got the United Nations,need I say more. I think the DVD says every president ,of the U.S.,is a Wilsonion. If you're like me,you get a lot of info from historical film,you'll want this.jnorstad",1115424000,4,553,4.54
1844187,1,B00008G72P,"""American Experience"" -- great educational television.  But do I already own this one?  I don't have them all: is it something I might be interesting in?  Is it recollections of World War II veterans?  Or what it was like photographing the dead of the Civil War?  Or how the west was won?  Or 19th century fashions? Or building bridges?  Can anybody solve the mystery?  Though I have inquired about this several times there has been no response.  If you cannot give us a picture of the package front, please include a three word summary....",1093737600,2,540,4.659574468085107

7983033,5,B00008G72P,"Stretched over two discs this shares his life with photos/actual footage, interviews, and reenactments. He was a child during and after the civil War and appears to have been a bit prejudiced. A man of faith it often led him to be FIRM in his positions. Initially a slow learner he went on to be a lawyer and get married, eventually becoming President of Princeton. an ailment caused him to take some time off.

He eventually was elected governor of New Jersey and then in 1912 POTUS! When war in Europe begins he aspires to stay out of the whole mess, even after a ship with Americans is sank. When eventually Open Season is declared on shipping he gets the United States into the violent war and troops smash the aggressors. He makes a list of Fourteen Points he feels need to be met and the enemy agrees to his positions. he goes to Europe and the people whose lands have been SMASHED and that were UNABLE to win the war without the United States intervention refuse the positions he stated.

He returns to the United States and goes on tour to gain the people's support to pass the treaty, then he essentially collapses from fatigue and is returned to Washington D.C. where it is determined he has had a stroke. SO, HIS WIFE essentially runs the country instead of the VP! Surreal!

Insightful, includes insightful extras. RIP.",1524355200,,1331,4.584033613445378
