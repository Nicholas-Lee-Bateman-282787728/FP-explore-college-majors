7588194,3,B01A5CPWYQ,"It's Great the Universal have reissued THE JERK on blu-ray an old Steve martin classic
the only old steve martin classic to be reissued on blu-ray
THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS & ALL OF ME are still yet to be reissued on blu-ray if they ever get one
THE MAN WITH 2 BRAINS DVD is by warner bros so don't hold your breath waiting for them
to do a blu-ray reissue
the old ALL OF ME DVD is only in 1:33:1 fullscreen to which should've been reissued in 1:85:1 ratio

anyway the Jerk on blu-ray, the only effort Universal made was giving the film a new 1:85:1 HD transfer & new 5.1 master audio mix
which does look amazing, very nice sharp & clear picture, much better picture than the old dvd version
and the sound quality has been boosted to new 5.1 mix
the only extras are from the old 25th anniversary dvd which are pointless extras in my opinion
they have nothing to do with film
what universal should've done is get new interview with Steve martin & Director carl reiner
about the making of the Jerk but they didn't bother for some reason
so whether you buy this new 2016 reissue or the previous 2013, you get the same content just different cover artwork
2-3 stars for both blu-ray reissues based on stupid pointless extras",1468886400,5,1218,4.342105263157895
