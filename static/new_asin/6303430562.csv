645516,1,6303430562,"I love Wayans family comedy and was an early fan of ""In Living Color"" and beyond. Keenen's movie ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" is one of my all-time favorite movies - a real masterpiece of comedic writing, producing and directing, all from the same man. This movie, however, is a low down dirty shame. While Keenen is a man of many talents, quasi-serious action hero isn't one of them. I wanted to like this movie, but couldn't. Jada Pinkett is foul-mouthed and totally unattractive in this embarrasingly stereotyped role. Watch Beverly Hills Cop instead.",1510531200,,551,4.872340425531915

Except for the bright presence of Jada Pinkett, ""A Low Down Dirty Shame"" (1994) fails as a mainstream action-comedy. Bullet-riddled mayhem rests uncomfortably with Wayans' misfired gags.

646453,1,6303430562,"Ok I'm not one to be a movie snob, but this movie was horrible. It doesn't hold my attention the way movies such as The Rock and Empire do, and those two movies are far more superior compared to this one. Keenan Ivory Wayans takes on the triple threat of star, writer, and director, and Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck he is not. Eastwood and Affleck have churned out some great movies taking on the triple role such as Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, Blood Work, Gran Torino, and The Town. Those movies are smart, character driven stories. This movie is flat out insipid. Now don't get me wrong because I think Keenan Ivory Wayans is talented. But his best work was on In Living Color, whereas he doesn't have the chops to be in movies. His younger brothers Damon and Marlon on the other hand, teamed up for one of the best comedy movies of the '90s. That movie being Mo' Money. But as I make my third different movie comparison, this movie has nothing on Mo' Money. I can't take Keenan Ivory Wayans seriously as an action hero and he just didn't fit the role as Shame. He would have been better off just directing and having someone like Jamie Foxx star in this movie. Foxx as Shame would have been interesting. Charles S. Dutton was actually good as the deceptive DEA agent Sonny Rothmiller and Andrew Divoff as Mendoza was intimidating and charismatic. Those 2 make this film somewhat watchable. Salli Richardson as Angela, was too plain for my liking. Even when she wasn't being cold and callous, Richardson's attempt to make Angela likable was nothing but a failure. Someone like Jennifer Lopez or Delilah Cotto would have done a better job capturing the likability of Angela. And last but not least, Jada Pinkett Smith. See my Jason's Lyric review about her performance in that movie. As for this movie, she's funny as Peaches, the spunky friend and side kick of Shame. But she gets really annoying as she becomes more of a motor mouth. Her performance here is slightly better than Jason's Lyric. Perhaps I shouldn't unveil the ""spoiler"" about Shame and Peaches, but those of you who plan to see this movie will probably figure it out. The action-comedy movie can be successful and the genre has churned out some good movies such as Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2, both Bad Boys, all three Rush Hour movies, All About The Benjamins, and Money Train. But as I make my fourth comparison in this review, A Low Down Dirty Shame isn't in the same class with those movies of it's genre that I mentioned. No pun intended, but passing up on this movie certainly wouldn't be a ""shame"". For those of you debating about seeing this movie, take my advice and avoid this ""shame""!",1329436800,,2668,4.583682008368201

646457,4,6303430562,"""A Low Down Dirty Shame"" has many laugh out loud moments.  Shame played by Keenan Ivory Wayans makes a living with odd police jobs and finds he has an opportunity to strike big, after following a lead from an old acquaintance.  Shame is casted into an action hero role and gets backup from partner Peaches, played by Jada Pinkett.  Undoubtedly, this is my favorite Jada Pinkett role.  Peaches is sassy, in your face, exuberant, and downright sexy.  Although her appearance is cute and petite, she will snap on anybody who steps on her toes.  Oddly enough, my favorite scene in the movie is the very beginning when peaches is an undercover maid and barges into a hotel room and spots a man on a toilet.  Peaches - ""house keeping"". Hotel guest on toilet - ""EXCUSE ME...do you know how to spell do not disturb"".  Peaches - ""Do you know how to spell Lysol, god damn you better check your pulse you might be dead"".",1305331200,8,909,4.5

646529,5,6303430562,"I recently repurchased this movie to see how my adult self liked it compared to my preteen self, who adored it. I was really looking forward to watching it and I was not disappointed. I think this period was Keenen Ivory Wayans at his peak. While he was known for some of the over-the-top humor of I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (which I also love) and broke records later with films that often flirted with the line of good taste (and often crossed it, in my opinion) like Scary Movie, this movie, and other works during the early to mid 90s such as The Five Heartbeats(which he co-wrote), shows his mastery of the subtle. This movie is great in part because he brings a humor, perspective, and feel that are distinctly ""Black"" yet entirely universal! I watched the movie with closed caption on (a strange habit of mine) and it was hilarious to see the mistakes the captioners made, especially with lines Peaches used.

Additionally, while it doesn't take itself too seriously, it is a wonderful action movie! Comparing this to ""Sucka"" is particularly insightful. Watching Shame transform from scruffy PI to sexy leading man is quite similar to Spade (and crew) getting into his army gear, right down to the boxes of bullets. What's different is the feel and that is the part of the genius of this film, in my opinion. It takes a ""Keen"" person to do a great satire/spoof that was as socially relevant as ""Sucka"" and his understanding of the elements that make a movie good is on display in this film. That the main character has only one, monosyllabic name is another subtle jab at the genre. Charles Dutton's role was a great surprise for that time period which I always thought was a great casting decision.

I can't imagine why anyone would dislike this film, except for those who strongly dislike swear words, which this movie has, but it is rated R. I'm giving it 5 stars, though I initially intended to give it 4 because it's my review, I intensely enjoyed this film, and everyone I spoke to about the movie after I re-watched it quickly warmed to their own memories of it and continually agreed with my assertion that this film, and Keenen's genius, is slept on...and that's a Low Down Dirty Shame.

646582,3,6303430562,"A Low Down Dirty Shame is really no more than all the most familiar Cop movie clichs arranged in an order that makes a barely cohesive story. But it's all the fun and silly action that occurs in between that really matters! It's a bit like The Last Boy Scout from a spoof-blaxploitation angle.

Shame (Keenan Ivory Wayans) is a former cop who has been blackballed after a major drugs bust went awry, leaving several DEA agents dead. He now works as a private detective, taking on suicide missions for peanuts and barely scraping by. His disapproving secretary Peaches (a very funny and very, very small Jada Pinkett) wants him to get his act together but he's too busy wallowing in self-pity.

His old pal from the DEA shows up and offers him a side mission to help get back at the Drug Kingpin who ruined his career. And so, with only a few clues, Shame begins his search and soon all roads lead to lies and deception. Like I said, the plot is certainly nothing special. But it does contain a helluva lot of laughs and decent action.

The one thing I can complain of is that the production design is kind of dated now. Action films have evolved so much in the past decade that watching ALDDS 12 years on can be a bit distracting. Wayans (who also directs as well as writing and starring) too often shoots non-actions scenes like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean.

If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie. High art is not what this film aims to be.

The DVD has a slightly soft 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer with a Dolby 5.1 sound design. There are zero extras.",1140739200,12,1738,4.385093167701863

646585,3,6303430562,"Amusing comedy homage to blacksploitation films, should collapse under its own premise but doesn't.  Due largely to the chemistry between the cast, and the comic skills of the elder Wayans the film actually allows you to sit through it.  Throw in a sassy Jada Pinkett and whoever that Pochohontas chick is and it's at least watchable.  Convoluted plot has Wayans as an ex-cop who has a chance for redemption by taking down a drug lord and a bad cop, the guy from Roc.  20 million dollars of the drug lords money being stolen by Keenan's ex, blah blah blah.  Not a lot of laugh out loud type moments, but a few smirkers despite Jada's constant head and finger wagging.",1074729600,,667,4.571428571428571

646587,3,6303430562,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" meets ""Shaft"" with wise-cracking Wayans as a private investigator who must track down his former love interest to bring down a drug dealer he thought he killed many years ago. Jada Pinkett joins the ride as Shame's sassy assistant, Peaches.
Shame has two days to find Angela (the beautiful Salli Richardson), his former fiance who is now working as a federal witness against crime boss, Mendoza (Andrew Divoff). Under the guise of his mentor, Sonny (Charles Dutton) and with the help of his female sidekick, Shame goes back to work with action-packed results.
""Low Down Dirty Shame"" is a little bit of everything. Wayans' script provides action, comedy, and a little bit of romance into a nice homage to 70's black action pics. The cast in ""Low Down"" does its job and does it well.  Wayans has fun playing the hero as he bungee-dives out of an exploding sporting goods store, uses James Brown routines to thwart a group of attacking guard dogs, and leads a Coloumbian nemesis through a KKK convention. Pinkett is surprisingly good as the comedy sidekick. What can one say about Salli Richardson? Well, let's just say her performance is very, very easy on the eyes. The concluding cat fight with her and Pinkett is a nice touch.",1067385600,2,1247,4.8
646588,5,6303430562,"A Low Down Dirty Shame is a great movie that pays homage to the blaxploitation films of the 70's. Keenan Ivory Wayans does a great job of mixing action and humor in this cool detective story about a PI looking for $20 million in stolen drug money. The supporting cast is very good here; Jada Pinkett and Salli Richardson aren't just eye candy, they give good performances too. However the only fault is with the film is Charles S. Dutton who overacts as usual. ALDDS is a great popcorn movie that will leave you smiling. Definitely buy it.",1059523200,2,539,4.510204081632653
646589,5,6303430562,"for any lover of comedy and action, this is the movie u must see. Jada is sassy, and Keenen is a scream. both combine and some crooked friend with the mod to handle.....equals fun!",1058832000,,180,4.323529411764706
646590,5,6303430562,"I can't say enough about this movie.  It makes me laugh each and everytime I watch it.  Keenan, Charles, Jada, and the rest, are all hilarious.  My only wish was that they would have given the ""Waymon"" character a larger role.  He was just too cute, too real, and funny as well. I give this movie a thumbs up.  It may not float everyone elses boat, but it has my vote.  And with all the seriousness going on in this world, when I want to just relax with some goofy folks and get a good laugh, this does the job.",1047859200,2,511,4.06
646591,4,6303430562,"No, this probably would not have cleaned up at the Oscars, but it certainly goes a long way in proving that Keenan Ivory Wayans is no one trick pony (ie; making, tired 70's blaxploitation flicks) and can turn in a  polished, entertaining, fast-paced, funny and interesting action flick. The  acting is wonderfully cheesy (except for the annoying, bull-like,  Step'n'Fetchit antics of Charles S. Dutton who overacts ALL the time) and  the pace is lighthearted from start to finish. Jada Pinkett flexes her  comedic skills considerably here as the ghettofied Peaches and is one of  the most endearing 'wacky sidekicks' in recent cinematic history.  Now, on  to the guilty pleasures part; my favorite sequence involves, you guessed  it, the gorgeous Salli Richardson.  Mr. Wayans gives her the greatest entry  scene of any actress EVER! As she steps out of a cab in slow motion,  tossing her hair and cooly placing sunglasses on her face, soft and  sensuous jazz plays over the scene and the camera [shows] her from  head to toe. We are then treated to the sight of her walking seductively to  the entrance of a chic boutique while WEARING THE [HECK] out of a  form-fitting, revealing dark dress. Brief though it may be, this scene  alone makes the movie worth owning! ""A Low Down Dirty Shame"" is  perfect viewing for a Saturday night with friends, or alone. It won't alter  your view of modern cinema, but it does what a good movie should do:  entertain and make you forget about your troubles, and on that level it  succeeds quite nicely.",966988800,,1537,4.812260536398467
