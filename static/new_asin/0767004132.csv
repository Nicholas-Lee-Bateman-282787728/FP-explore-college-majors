7788743,3,0767004132,"this is not the entire series or complete episodes as originally shown by the history channel in the nineties.  I remember episodes on the origination of the franchise, like mcdonalds, and others.  the history channel should market the complete series of ""The Fifties"" because most of the revolutions that transpired for decades after the fifties had their roots in the fifties and the complete series is very clear at revealing the phenomena of the fifties.",1483488000,2,458,5.093333333333334

7788745,5,0767004132,"This is an excellent documentary. It brings back many memories and teaches me things I did not know. Only one problem with this production. It is not available on DVD. I have not been able to get an answer as to why. I even contacted the distributor, and the producers, and no one knew why it has not been made into a DVD. There is no excuse I can think of other than possible legal entanglements. Same reason you cannot find the movie ""Porgy and Bess"" on video of any type.
If someone knows why ""The Fifties"" is not in DVD and whether it could be in the future, please let me know at edclancy2@aol.com
Thanks,

7788747,5,0767004132,"David Halberstam breaks all of the old boundaries by displaying what life was really like in the 1950s; the era of atomic bombs, racial tension and mothers in pearls and high heels.

The footage, vintage photos and first-person accounts all add up to make for great viewing pleasure!  I am a Baby Boomer and this series of videos shows how life really was back in the Golden Era when us Boomers were called ""the luckiest generation"" because we were born into a post-war world where our parents had much more money than their parents.  Life was grand; we had Walt Disney, Levittown and stay-at-home mothers who always greeted Dad with a smile and each child with kiss, a cookie and a glass of milk from a quart glass bottle!  We enjoyed luxuries our parents never had experienced and they spoiled us.  They wanted new ranch houses and good schools, so suburbia popped up to accommodate the ever-growing need for housing created by the post-war economic boom.

David breaks the rules and stereotypes set forth by so many other people who considered the 1950s the best time in America!  All that glittered wasn't ""gold"" as things such as Women's Lib, Miltown anti-anxiety medication and birth control shattered the prim and proper images of the 50s.  Betty Friedan wrote Petyton Place, completely exposing small-town America.  African Americans wanted their much-deserved piece of the American Dream amid racial tensions during the 50s.

This is one of my favorite documentary series and well worth the price and viewing time!",1266624000,,1523,4.9372549019607845
7788748,2,0767004132,"I lived in the 1950s and it was just great. This show presented too many stuff from a 90s leftist perspective. At the outset, however, there is SOME good to be found in this miniseries: the descriptions of the civil rights movement, suburbanization, the beatniks, television, the fall of Cuba to Castro and the rise of rock and roll are quite accurate, even if you can get by the ""teens are rebels"" slant.
That, unfortunately, is all the good to be found in this seemingly endless procession of leftist viewpoints. Having portrayed the usual happy image of the decade, the producers  seem willing to declare war on this, and they do. They fling us from the frying pan of rock and roll straight into the fire of total liberalism. The producers' goal is clear from the beginning: to portray the 1950s as a horrible decade where everyone was afraid, where people refused to speak out, and  where society hated certain things (i.e. sex) that they didn't want others to do when in fact THEY and all their friends were doing it.
The charges that Joe McCarthy created paranoia when there really was no real Communist threat is presented like it always is, even though the Venona Project confirms that there were Soviet spies in the highest branches of the U.S. government who were giving atomic secrets to Stalin. Portrayals of feminism, the birth of the birth control pill and glorification of the Communist idiot Betty Friedan are presented in legthy detail. It doesn't stop there: it gets worse.
(...)
Hugh Hefner, Alfred Kinsey, Betty Friedan and Julius Rosenberg are presented as the real 1950s icons, NOT Dwight Eisenhower, Jonas Salk, Joseph McCarthy or Guy Mitchell when in fact THEY were the real 1950s icons. Steer completely away from this and instead seek out other resources. I might start working on a 50s documentary to show things the way they REALLY were.",1080086400,7,1865,4.806853582554517
7788749,5,0767004132,"I've always had a special interest in the decade in which I was born and this six-part video collection from The History Channel, along with the more extensive book upon which it is based, provides an excellent overview  of some of the more significant political and social events which defined  this post-war decade.  It is a marvelous journey back to a pivotal time in  20th Century American history.
In 300+ minutes, it examines topics as  widely diverse as the Cold War and Senator McCarthy's Communist witch hunts  to the founding of Hugh Hefner's Playboy empire and the Grace Metallious  penned ground-breaking novel, Peyton Place.
I highly recommend this  wonderful boxed set as a minor course in 1950's history or just for the  pure enjoyment of seeing the American Dream unfold.",961200000,,787,4.992307692307692
