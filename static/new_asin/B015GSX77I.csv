8733545,5,B015GSX77I,"It was great to see all of the celebrities I grew up watching:  Gene Wilder, Mel Brooks, Lucille Ball, John Denver, Rex Reed, Marie Osmond, Andy Williams, etc.  The DVD quality is excellent, although my one complaint is that during the Gene Wilder interview, when they say that they are going to show a clip, they cut away and cut back to the interview as if we'd seen it.  I can only assume that they couldn't get the rights to show the footage.  Disappointing.  Nonetheless, this is a wonderful stroll down memory lane!  As I was only really interested in the 1970s, I was very happy to be able to purchase just this disc instead of the whole Merv Griffin set (60s, 70s, and 80s), saving me at least $25.",1489536000,2,706,4.392307692307693
8733546,2,B015GSX77I,I was and am extremely disappointed with this item because none of the appearances of FREDDIE PRINZE SR are on it!!,1477440000,,115,4.523809523809524

8733548,1,B015GSX77I,A rip off. They don't tell you these are the exact same discs that come with the bigger set of 60' to 80's shows,1455753600,5,112,3.7083333333333335
