8436139,4,B004MNOH3C,This video is presented in a way that an art instruction video should be. Ned shows how to mix the colors as he works his way through the painting. I have purchased many videos and most of them have been almost worthless to me because they show very little or no color mixing which I think is the most important thing in a video. I would purchase another DVD from NED Mueller.,1320364800,5,376,4.236111111111111
