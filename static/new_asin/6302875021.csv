The story begins at a College of Law. [Recognize the building?] A professor gives a lecture to his students. He will take a year's vacation now. What will he do? See a movie? Who threw a stench bomb into a theater? Some kind of protection racket? Can the newspaper do something about it? No, but Professor Lindsay will try. A Civic Committee wants to find a Special Prosecutor. James Lindsay speaks up. [Is he absent-minded?] Is there a traitor in the Civic Committee? Will Lindsay be in danger now? We see how gangsters operated then. Will the victims testify before the Grand Jury? [How secret is their testimony?] Simpson tells the D.A. Another man has big plans. [Is there a leak somewhere?] Miss Frankie Ballew knows her way around. Lindsay tours a nightclub. People dance ""The Big Apple"". [Is there a hidden agenda behind the proposed clean-up?]

Cronin shows up to meet Lindsay. Imported hoodlums are making trouble for him. There is a shot from the dance floor, and a man falls to the ground. There is a scandal here. Will Lindsay get the financial support he wants? Witnesses have bad memories. Who took over Cronin's business? Who controls the Acme Insurance company? Does he control Frankie Ballew? Is there a leak in the Special Prosecutor's office? ""They killed Butler!"" Was it an inside job? Lindsay fires his entire staff and replaces them with his students. Lindsay will fight back with volunteers against organized crime. Can publicity work? There is a meeting in his office. Lindsay gives a lecture. Where is Eddie Girard? Lindsay gets a useful tool as a present from his wife, just in time! Can they record the meetings in Kitchel's apartment? [No search warrant?] Will Lindsay ignore the law to arrest criminals?

Paul Ferguson finds Kitchel dead at his apartment, made to look like a suicide. Who knew? Lindsay asks the witnesses to testify so they can round up the gang. Paying for protection may not be a good long-term solution. The witnesses identify the criminals. Lindsay presents a document to Eugene Ferguson, who then asks to borrow Lindsay's car. ""That was your father."" The loose ends are left untied. Lindsay returns to his law school. But who will fill the power vacuum? Note the presence of small owner-operated businesses at that time.

This picture echoes the classic westerns of the 1930s where the small ranchers unite against the oppression from the big rancher, who may control the sheriff and mayor of a small town. How can you remove corruption from a city when the Ruling Class is in cahoots with the criminals? Can this situation be corrected with a special prosecutor? In the 19th century a town militia would eliminate criminals. The 1851 San Francisco Committee of Vigilance did that, and was copied in many other towns and villages. Since this included all the people, it soon conflicted with the desires of big corporations by the end of the 19th century. In 1890 South Carolina passed a Prohibition law that was signed by the Governor. But it was nullified when the militia refused to enforce it. There were other examples, such as in 1877 Pittsburgh during a wide-spread strike. This democratic check on big corporations was soon eliminated by paid professionals who followed orders.",1307404800,,3260,4.8684684684684685
7832267,4,6302875021,"Columbia Pictures Corporation presents ""I AM THE LAW"" (1938) (83 min/B&W) -- Starring Edward G. Robinson, Barbara O'Neil, John Beal, Wendy Barrie & Otto Kruger

Directed by Alexander Hall

Edward G. Robinson, ( John Lindsay) featured in the role of a law professor who decides to accept a position to clean up the corruption of gangsters and the protection rackets.

Edward G. learns it's not that easy to fight these racketeers and hoods.  His close lawyer friend John Beal it the son of mob boss Otto Kruger, things get interesting.

The highlight of the film is a scene where we get Robinson on the dance floor, which has to be seen to be believed. Wonderful supporting cast with Wendy Barrie and Barbara O'Neil.

Film is not much different from what Robinson was doing at Warner Brothers at the time. Still of your a fan of Mr. Robinson this is another winner from his illustrious career.

7832268,4,6302875021,"Wild East Productions is known for their double feature packages spotlighting Cult Euro actors released in the golden age of the Spaghetti Western and genre films.  Now its time for the women to shine as Volume 3 of their Euro Crime Collection highlights the hauntingly, earthy beauty of Claudia Cardinale, an actress who I always thought was as good or better than her Euro counterparts Sophia Loren and Silvana Mangano.  Both films have the Sicilian Mafia as their main themes but are on opposite ends of their subjects.  The first, 'I AM THE LAW' aka 'IL PREFETTO DI FERRO'-1977- has less of Claudia and more of Giuliano Gemma who's character is based on a true judge  who in the early thirties tried to roust out the Mafia element from the peasants in Sicily. You will also recognize Jess Franco actor Paul Muller who plays, what else, a sleazy , political informer.  Sometimes resembling a Spaghetti Western by substituting Mafia thugs for Mexican banditos, the film is more political thriller than action movie directed very straight forward by Pasquale Squitieri and emerges as an interesting time capsule with a melancholic music score by the master, Ennio Morricone.  The second film fares Claudia much better in 'MAFIA' aka 'IL GIORNO DELLA CIVETTA'-1968- which  was made the same year as her masterpiece, Sergio Leone's 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST' and boasts a fine performance from Franco Nero and American actors Lee J. Cobb who plays his Johnny Friendly character from Elia Kazans 'ON THE WATERFRONT', and Nehemiah Persoff.  The film focuses on Claudia's brother who is murdered in a mob hit in the Sicilian countryside and the investigation and tug of war between Mafioso Cobb and police captain Nero. Director Damiano Damiani who would go on to make 'CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN' also with Nero and released by Wild East in their Volume 2 Euro Crime package, directs with his usual aplomb.  The film has more intrigue than the first one on this double bill boasting beautiful photography by Tonino Delli Colli, one of Italy's greatest cinematographers who worked with among others Mario Bava, Sergio Leone, and Dario Argento. The music score by Giovanni Fusco gives the film a nice, Euro feel throughout.  Both films are presented in Wild Easts up to par quality with beautiful 1.85 widescreen transfers which look brand new . Containing picture galleries and trailers for both films, we have another great double dose of Euro fare for action fans and gangster movie lovers alike.",1291680000,16,2503,4.952267303102626
7832269,3,6302875021,"Well this one may only be for fans of Edward G. Robinson but it's not a bad film.  I cought it one evening on TCM and I've always kind of liked Robinson although his films don't turn up nearly enough on TV and few are on VHS, and we won't even talk about DVD.  Robinson is John Lindsay, a law professor who is asked by a local civic leader to help bring down the organized crime that is plaguing the city.  Lindsay eventually recruits several of his students to help infiltrate the mob ranks and eventually turn the tables on the very man who requested Lindsay's help in the first place.  Ah...you sure couldn't get away with that kind of plotting these days...but Robinson is always so fun to watch and seems to put equal gusto into every role he takes on.

The film was directed by Alexander Hall, a competant studio director who would go on to direct some semi-classic films such as ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"", ""The heavenly Body"", and 'Bedtime Story"".  Hall did pretty well with romantic comedy films but crime dramas were not his forte.  But Like I said, Robinson makes it watchable.",1113955200,5,1085,4.477157360406092
