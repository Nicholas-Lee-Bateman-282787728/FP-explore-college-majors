2164221,5,B000638PIU,"I had never heard of this film before. I LIKE Bakshi's stuff but it frequently misses the mark. Often his films tend to look cheap and the plots are kind of rambling. Not so with Fire and Ice. It's VERY straight forward and the art is amazing.

Our journey begins with a guys face being contorted as if he's being sucked off. This is transposed with shots of a glacier that apears to be growing and changing. We soon discover that the guy is Nekron and he is a dark wizard that can control the ice. He destroys a village with it and there is only one survivor, Larn.

The glacier moves on towards ""Firekeep"", with which the wizard is at war. He sends envoys to demand unconditional surrender and when the King refuses, they kidnap his daughter. And OH what a daughter! She's only just barely contained in her string bikini.

She escapes her captors and meets up with Larn. Eventually we meet Darkwolf, a drifting barbarian with legendary fighting skill. This guy is essentially Conan.

The art in this film is spectacular. The backdrops are very basic, but beautiful nonetheless. The action is great and there are plenty of new elements that keep popping up. At 80 minutes it's a bit brisk and I wanted it to go on for another three hours.

It should be noted that the image is amazing. The bit rate stays in the high 8's and even breaches the high 9's, so it's superbly crisp and surprisingly clean. It's even got a DTS-ES mix so the sound is fantastic too.

There are plenty of extras including footage of the original shoot with actors and the whole process of animation. The best is on disc 2. It's a 93 minute documentary on the life of Frank Frazzeta. If you don't know who that is, he's pretty much the modern equivelant of Michelangelo. he just so happens to work in genre pieces and they sell in the 1/4 of a million dollar range. He worked side by side with Bakshi on this film for over a year and has a tremendous impact on the art world in general. The man is so damn talented it's freaky! He's even kind of weirded out about it! He suffered several strokes a few years ago and get this, since he can't use his right hand anymore he's started drawing and painting with his left! And it's just as beautiful as what he created with his right! Your jaw will drop when you see the gorgeous images that simply will not be stopped by his condition.

Anyway, this is an EXCELLENT blind buy and I encourage you all to check it out.",1125446400,6,2435,4.362030905077263
2164222,4,B000638PIU,"Well, chances are if you stumbled upon this DVD it is because you are a fan already. Fire and Ice has existed for years now on VHS and poor-quality, bootleg DVD. Finally it has arrived officialy on DVD and hopefully it will boast great quality. From the looks of the description and sound it will...

But for a while now I have been deciding whether or not to buy the Frank Frazetta: Painting with Fire DVD which runs over twenty dollars. Since it is included with this movie, on the surface it seems like a great deal. The problem is, from what I can tell of the description, the second disc only contains the actual biography portion of the Frazetta DVD and not the bonus features. So basically, if you buy this Fire and Ice DVD, from what I can tell, you will be missing the bonus features found on the Frank Frazetta: Painting with Fire DVD...a minor strike, but a strike none the less.",1123545600,5,890,4.393939393939394
2164223,5,B000638PIU,"This is probably Ralph Bakshi's greatest achievement. What you have here is swords and sorcery cel-animated movie with all the style of Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian. Bakshi collaborated with famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta in making the imagery of this movie and it shows. There is an intelligence to this movie that stands out above just about all of the barbarian movies made even up to now (with the original Conan being the only exception).

They use a rotoscoping technique that gives the animation a lifelike fluidity found in some of the classic Disney movies like Sleeping Beauty, but keep in mind this is by no means a Disney movie. In other words: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. There is a heck of a lot of violence and scantily clad people on this picture. While it is rated PG I think by today's standards it's more PG-13.

As a hack and slash, barbarian warrior kind of movie this is great. If you loved Conan the Barbarian, The Beastmaster and other movies of this sort then you will love Fire and Ice. For the longest time there was a DVD release in Europe but none yet in the states. Now they finally released this movie for the U.S., and the DVD comes with some really nifty extras (making of featurette and a Frank Frazetta documentary). Unless you find this VHS copy dirt cheap I would recommend getting the DVD instead.",1104710400,40,1352,4.629166666666666

Since there is hardly any information at all about this movie I thought to included this synopsis that was taken from the back of the video box (not an entirely accurate plot summary, but it will do):

Fire and Ice, an animated adventure film, is the work of the imaginations of Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta, masters of fantasy and illustration. A tiny village is destraoyed by a surging glacier, which serves as a deadly domain for the evil Ice Lord, Nekron. The only survivor is a young warrior, Larn, who vows to avenge this act of destruction! The evil continues, however, as Nekron's palace of ice heads straight towards Fire Keep, the great fortress ruled by the good king Jarol. When Jarol's beautiful daughter, Teegra, is abducted by Nekron's subhuman ape-like creatures, Larn begins a daring search for her. What results is a tense animated battle between good and evil, surrounded by the mystical elements of the ancient past!",1088985600,18,2001,4.6923076923076925

2164251,2,B000638PIU,"This movie is pretty bad. First the plot is unimaginative: the all powerful evil villain, out to conquer the world, must be defeated by a motley crew of heroes including a voluptuous bikini clad princess, a courageous barbarian and a mysterious masked warrior. The evil minions are literally subhumans, kind of a mix between orcs and neanderthals. Although this is a fantasy movie the logical inconsistencies are an insult even to this genre. For example, much of the movie occurs within a glacier, yet the characters are basically in underwear and we don't see even a shiver. The voluptous, and one assumes pampered princess, walks barefoot through the jungle on glaciar without any apparent discomfort. The characters just pop up without any rhyme of reason. The masked warrior just shows up to help our heroes but we are given absolutely no background on the character. We wonder: does he have a beef with Necron ( the villain)? How did he become such a superior warrior ( he routinely dispatches subhumans a dozen at a time). Why does he use a mask? Also we are introduced to a mysterious witch in the jungle after her minion has kidnapped the princess from the subhumans just to have her killed off in the next scene without any context whatsoever. I continue to be flabbergasted by the complete lack of logic and common sense in so many movie scripts. A competent high school  student could have written a better script than this. In summary: watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do.",1493596800,,1515,4.782442748091603
2164252,4,B000638PIU,"This movie is so weird.  It's probably best not to read into it too much or add things that really aren't there, lest you ruin its simplicity and hype it for all the wrong and possibly really negative reasons.  BUT, since it's already so obviously pulp trash, I'm totally going there.  Back to the glory days when anime artists were still putting a little effort into programming young D&D players into being dirty kinky homosexuals when they grew up. This is basically your average white male idiographic fantasy.  It's playing to the lowest common denominator who is, let's face it, extremely racist, misogynistic, bisexual but way too homophobic to ever realize much less accept it and smart enough to run before the glacier crashes but not smart enough to avoid the battle that kills everyone else after.

Extremely racist overtones delight from the very beginning and promise much more varied denigration and fearful and violent associations of non-white cultures before the end of the movie.  The butch leather daddy king, gives a more subtle hint to a sexually permissive if not fantastically perverse and promiscuous ""Indian"" fire culture than his soft mesh pasty and thong bikini is my only outfit and perfectly fine for formal wear princess daughter.  In her defense she does evolve from berry picking to dagger throwing as proper female skills towards the end.  The shaven, pony-tailed he-man brow of the hero is exactly what you'd expect from any truly righteous aryan, only to be matched by his bondage is the best greeting between men masked ""bff"" with a deep rugged, this is how men do it when there aren't any women around, wilderness voice and rather large, long, thick, dark and swarthy battle axe.  Foreboding and scary music builds as the princess is trapped and kidnapped and taken into a horrible, horrible place for our hero to have to follow... a hilariously racist middle eastern looking city.

And there's the villain, who is just my favorite new villain I think in a long time.  Nekron is a bit of a fancy lad.  He tends to blush and shy away and then giggle a little wickedly at the ladies instead of offering polite small talk.  His mother's a little overbearing, like she doesn't know exactly why he never goes out or brings home any dates.  It might have something to do with the homosexually orgasmic migraines he's constantly having that are causing the glaciers and ice to advance, when not controlling his enemies and causing them to fully, and I mean fully impale themselves on their own long swords.  Thank goodness our hero and his massssked bff have arrived to save the day.  Well our hero is just too interesting and has too much of a fight in him to be destroyed by Nekron, so that leaves mask man who standing in the shadow of Nekron has the longest thickest codpiece between his legs and with axe lifted and the villain running out of mind control juice over such an enthusiastic manly man, you know right where it's going.  Somewhere in Nekron's side, I say somewhere, because despite all the other blood and gore in the movie you don't exactly see.  You see masked man standing above, with the satisfied grin of deep penetration and Nekron in the throes of ecstatic mind numbing pleasure, I mean death, death throes.  Cut bizarrely and strangely to the King, who somehow through the ethers is aware the villain has been defeated, grinning wickedly, like he knows best of all the exact feeling when the masked man shows up to finally give your female dog posterior what it deserves.

Ughghuhhhhh, that's not what it's about!!!!  Says every seventeen year old str8 boy reading this right now.  Just go back to that place you had it paused on Tigra... no one will be the wiser.",1493337600,,3719,4.751166407465008
2164253,4,B000638PIU,"I'm feeling generous toward this movie tonight. It's probably a 3, but looking at what they did with the animation -- rotoscoping, I think it was called -- and the Frank Franzetta / Boris Valejo-inspired characters, kind of fun in a nostalgic late-70s, early-80s way. I'm sure I would have loved to see this as a kid. The storyline is basically -- some time long ago, between dinosaurs and Abraham, there live a blond-haired, blue-eyed boy who's village was slaughtered by a evil queen and her evil son. Very similar sounding plot to The Beastmaster. The mother uses her son's magic abilities to send a wall of ice down upon the lands to kill all of the dissenters... or, I don't know why. It doesn't matter. But the evil queen's henchmen, the subhumans (basically orcs from LOTR), go to one kingdom and tell a vulnerable king and his son to negotiate a surrender. Meanwhile, more subhumans climb into the castle and steal the king's daughter. I don't know why -- a gift from the queen to her son. Later, the damsel in distress meets the blond-haired blue-eyed boy, who survived the village raid and ran from the subhumans. The strike up a friendship and the rest of the movie is the good guys trying to save the damsel in distress again. The movie features very little clothing for any of the characters. The women sometimes have nipples, but the men don't -- very strange. There's a lot of killing and fighting and running, killing, fighting, repeat. Not a lot of dialog, but the storyline isn't much of an adventure anyway. Just a lot of looking at the damsel's pear shaped behind and guys muscled butts and pecs. There's not much emotional weight -- just sit back and look at the painted backgrounds, and the figures and enjoy an hour away from the modern world. But there is a lot of killing in not-overly-gory ways.",1493078400,2,1821,4.6234567901234565

Even though the realism of the scenery and objects in the film can't compete with the high-tech CGI these days, the character's movement was very fluid and realistic. Really can tell the director and the entire movie crew put a lot of effort into this film.

The story is not very complicated and that may be the only drawback I can make about this film. Viewers need to be aware that this is not a film for kids because of the adult oriented customs (or lack-there-of!) around the main characters.

Must be a lot of Millennials with gender dysphoria bashing it because it doesn't look as good as CGI animation and because there's no ambiguous gender identity to the characters, I guess. This is a VERY original story albeit with a very predictable plot.
Frank Frazetta at his prime (even though he was 55!). Such a talented artist who belongs to a very elite group of artists that has the ability to capture the freeze-frame motion of a single moment.  And let me not forget to mention his ability to capture the human physique from any angle; extremely pleasing to the eye no matter what your gender or which team you bat for. Very entertaining and one that I've watched over and over and over, still owning the VHS and DVD.  As a side note, Robert Rodriguez will be directing a live-action remake of the film sometime in the future.
Undoubtedly, some SJW can scream ""RACISM!"" in regards to the melanin-enriched Neanderthal-esque sub-humans being exploited by a pale white overlord, but they can only do so by completely ignoring that the protagonist and antagonist are both white. Said SJW can also scream ""SEXISM!"" with a little more merit to their claim, but whatever, I'm watching the movie because skull-clefting battleaxes wielded by robust warriors is supreme entertainment.",1490054400,5,1329,4.902222222222222

It certainly does not follow modern tropes and it made from a great fantasy adventure. The animation isn't by any means the greatest at some points, but the fighting and dinosaur flight scenes are amazing. Like someone did their research on how they should be captured. The expressions are done very well. The backgrounds are beautifully painted and made me want to know more about this alien world, very beautiful with a very wide range of environments. It's a short, but wondrous adventure.

There are a lot of things not explained (for example, who the devil is the batman looking guy and what was with the crazy necromancer lady) and the main character (Loren) has a tendency of leaving his companions high and dry.  The music is okay, but fairly repetitious.  The animation isn't anything to write home about either.  They did do a great job on the villain.  Necron is in every way, shape, and form creepy.

Frank Frazetta was the artist that made sword and sorcery cool.  Bikers and Conversion Van owners across American had boot-leg copies of his work air-brushed onto their rides in the 1970s.  Ralph Bakshi was already making a reputation for himself as the Bad-Boy of Animation by then with movies like Fritz The Cat.  It's nice to see these two had a chance to work together. I only wish they had a bigger budget and more support. The sound track was a monotonous rip-off of the excellent Leonard Rosenman soundtrack for Bakshi's Lord of the Rings. If he could have afforded Rosenman for Fire & Ice if would have made a big difference.  None the less, this is a one-of-a-kind film. There will never be another Frazetta or Bakshi.",1481587200,,776,4.635036496350365

2164327,5,B000638PIU,"Ralph Bakshi had already done sword and sorcery in animated films like Wizards and The Lord Of The Rings, the underground indy cartoonist teamed up with fantasy artist master Frank Frazetta to create Fire and Ice. Released in 1983, the concept of mature animation had peaked with titles like Heavy Metal(which by the way Bakshi had nothing to do with), this fantasy was set in a more prehistoric world as opposed to most Arthurian settings.

 Set sometime in the past when humans and dinosaurs apparently still existed together, a kingdom ruled by the water-bending Nekron expands his terrain with ice flows, stopping only at the fiery volcano domain of King Jarol. His daughter, the sizzling Princess Teegra, is kidnapped by Nekron's cavemen minions. She escapes, and crosses path with Lam, the last of a tribe wiped out by Nekron's forces. Teegra is recaptured, so Lam teams up with the wandering masked warrior called Darkwolf(imagine a caveman version of Batman!). The two barbarians get help from Jarol's pterodactyl pilots to launch a Death Star-ish attack on Nekron's keep.

 If you were a fan of Thundar The Barbarian, then this one is totally up your alley, or at least what most fans wanted the original He-Man series to be! There's some fantastic rotoscope animation, which had improved since Bakshi's films of the 70s, and Frazetta's designs are truly iconic, especially since Darkwolf was based on his legendary Death Dealer character. There isn't any blatant sex or nudity as you might thing for a primordial fantasy, but still plenty of action and violence.

First the good: The movie had a real story line. Not a great one but solid enough. Second the animated look was overall the best thing about the movie. The world was interesting and generally well done. The characters moved through the world in a convincing way and that is hard to do. The characters stayed on point and generally behaved in believable ways.

Now the not so good: The faces of the characters were crude and not drawn with the same care as the rest of the scenes. The heroine's body and how she was clad for the entire movie (or not clad dependng on your point of view) was an over the top pitch for gratuitous sex. Nothing subtle there. And finally there were very few plot twists based in the character's personallities and the end was obvious a mile away.",1477526400,2,862,4.449367088607595

So I expected so great action fantasy.
The movie actually made me phase out. I lost the thread of whatever p[lot there was. and excitement level was low. PLUS, the rendition, animation by Bakshi makes me think he was doing drugs; very boring, simple cartoon redition, Nothing like his previous ""The Hobbit"". And Frazetata's input was hard to discern...hardly any contribution from him.
So don't expect to be wowed. It's a good sleepy-time bed hitting goodnitght don't remember experience.

Sure sure, the quality is all there as a blu ray with the options, and Amazon does a great job of packaging and getting it to you lickity split.

The movie just horrible. The animation was lazy. They used real people and just drew over them. Now as an animator/graphics person myself, I know this is called rotoscoping, but I've seen it used before effectively. Here.. it's downright lazy. There's no real story or dialogue worth a hill of beans. They spend half the movie in a jungle because it's so slow moving, and then SUDDENLY they are miles south in the Firelands. It's like... wtf? Dude it took you guys like a week to go 5 miles, now you walk for an afternoon and your 50-100 miles south.

Reminds me of the last movie in the Hunger Games series. Where they just took days to go a couple of blocks, and then suddenly they can do 75 blocks in 25 minutes. WTF?

Bottom line, if you're looking for a cult classic, go with Heavy Metal. I got that Blu Ray as well and it's INFINITELY better. In all ways.

One of the great things that stood out in this film was how every character was exploited in every scene.

2164548,3,B000638PIU,"At the rate things are going, animation rebel Ralph Bakshi may never produce another full-length animated feature, and in this regard, Fire and Ice may be the last hurrah for his style of visual storytelling (unless you're a fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cool-World/dp/B0000AUHQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cool World</a>). Its a striking movie that belongs to a bygone era of experimentation in feature animation, and its quite deserving of its cult following. Its also a flawed film that loses a little with each viewing, at least in my experience. Bakshi die-hards and animation disciples will probably want to check this one out, but casual viewers will probably have a tougher time being engaged.

The story: In a showdown between the kingdoms of ice and fire, a kidnapped princess (voiced by Maggie Roswell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Simpsons/dp/B007KFZ85K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Simpsons</a>) and the lone survivor of a massacred village (William Ostrander,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-and-South/dp/B004EXWGIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North and South</a>) find themselves on a path to dispose of the evil ice lord (Stephen Mendell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Turtles-The-Next-Mutation/dp/B0089BSOGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</a>).

Almost any fantasy fan will be able to tell at a glance that the films visual style is an animated realization of the work of artist Frank Frazetta. To help achieve this feat, Bakshi uses rotoscoping to grand effect. The animation is a lot less awkward than his previous attempts to animate entire casts this way, and it even helps bolster the tone of the film more than once. There are lengthy sequences that go on without dialogue, and these scenes remain engaging through masterfully-rendered body language and facial expressions. This helps enliven the numerous action scenes as well, many of which are heightened by the inclusion of some equally well-rendered beasts and monsters.

Nevertheless, the amplitude of adrenaline scenes helps illustrate the movies major weakness: its story. The filmmakers seem more concerned with simply animating cool things than crafting a fully-rounded tale or building the relationships between characters. Removing the scenes which do not actually advance the plot would probably chop the runtime down to a little less than half its current 81-minute length, and this bulky amount of padding becomes more obvious every time you watch the film. Without exception, the characters are one-dimensional and undergo little development  making the movie less dramatically mature than many modern video games.

Bakshis stylistic choices make it hard not to also examine the movie in a social context, and its pretty eclectic. For one thing, adherence to the Frazetta style makes this one of the few fantasy flicks Ive seen wherein the male characters are almost as sexualized as the females, give the minimalist wardrobe. Hero Larn finds himself in need of rescue several times, and despite the ceaseless efforts of the screenplay to turn her into a damsel, heroine Teegra is a pretty resourceful character. Other depictions are less progressive, though. Ice lord Nekron is pretty unambiguously gay, but his implied homosexuality  specifically, the fact that he finds Teegra undesirable  is presented as an evil attribute. And what can be said about the dark-skinned, animalistic subhumanoids other than an acknowledgement of how clearly fantasy often caters to exclusively white audiences?

Despite these shortcomings, its hard to deny the movies energy and uniqueness. Finding an animated fantasy film of this ones ambition that was produced in the west is still something of an Easter egg hunt  lets face it, theres a good chance that you happened upon this page by chance  and of the handful of ones that you could pick from, you could do worse than Fire and Ice. Its a fun adventure, and while I would not recommend an outright purchase, I would suggest that you afford yourself the chance that theres something here you enjoy and give it a rental.",1448064000,17,4279,5.898222940226171

The movie is set in a prehistoric world where the forces of Ice, led by the sinister Nekron, is gradually expanding their glacier kingdom south into the more fertile lands of Fire Keep. Only Lorne, the sole survivor of a tribe of warriors crushed by Nekron's forces, and Teegra the princess of Fire Keep, can stop him with the aid of badass barbarian Dark Wolf (arguably the best character in the movie).

This is 80's nostalgia at its best. The creators of this movie used roto-scoping to create the realistic movements of the actors. Think of rotoscoping as the precursor to the green screen techniques used by movie studios today. It's feels like watching a painting come to life, and for anyone who wants to gain a true appreciation of how the film was made using this style, I highly suggest watching the ""Making Of"" part after seeing the film. Animators were truly magicians in those days, no computers, no CG graphics, just hand, paint, loud machines, and a lot of heart.

For those who believe animation is solely for the little 'uns, do NOT buy this movie. There is a lot of violence and blood, as this is about barbarians after all. Also, a lot of near nudity, especially on the part of Teegra, the insanely hot heroine of the film. No full nudity, mind you, but our more 'Puritan' audience might feel put off by it.

Get ready for a great adventure.",1419379200,,1508,4.619402985074627
2164583,5,B000638PIU,"I bought this as a gift for my 22 year old son he has left the roost & deserves a copy of his own. We used to watch this together & have fun trying to cast it with actors over the year's wishing someone would remake this into a live action film. Now there is a multi million dollar piece of advise to some director! Over the years our imaginary live action movie cast has changed, but this animated sword & sorcery classic never gets old! Just look at the number of 5 star reviews on this old gem!!! Frank Frazetta  enjoyed the status of a living legend long before he passed away. Frazetta's art work was in such demand that publishing houses would ask him "" You can just give us anything we will find a book to put it on!?!?!  His artwork re introduced thousands to the brilliant work of Robert E Howard's in the 70's as well as breathing new life into Edgar Rice Burroughs's novels! The bonus disc is worth the cost of this masterpiece collaboration between Frazetta & Bakshi!!! The bonus disc is all about Frank Frazetta a nice biography on an incredible artist!  The feature film is top notch Sword & Sorcery action at its best. It could have been penned by Robert E Howard(creator of Conan) himself. I am an artist myself & like Frank Frazetta I draw from my minds eye meaning I use no swipes, models or photo's & I believe that any artist that works this way has a natural ability for story telling because the images you paint are scenes from an imaginary adventure story from your minds eye. Frank also collaborated with James Silke on 4 Death Dealer novels. If you've listened to Molly Hatchet that's the dark brooding medieval giant on all their album covers. I could go on forever spouting Frank Frazetta praises, so to some it up If you Love Conan or The Lord of the Rings you will probably love this movie also!",1418342400,9,1825,4.377581120943953

The writing is not bad, it's just simple.  It's a sort of Frank Frazetta stylized, savage fairy tale.  The animation is its own, the look is completely unique and despite the amount of skin that is shown that story is surprisingly innocent.  The animation is a pretty impressive form of rotoscoping which some people like and some people don't.  I personally thought it was great!
  On the cons, the characters are under developed.  They should have spent more time getting us acquainted with these people and providing back story.  The conclusion, though not entirely inconclusive, still leaves something to be desired as it feels like it has resolved the over arching problem but hasn't given the characters any inward triumph to carry away off screen.  Like we didn't get the moral to the story, perhaps.
  Over all, an enjoyable film.  I personally love the artistry, I love Frazetta, I loved this neo-caveman world,  but the story just needed more substance to take it from something enjoyable to something amazing.",1400198400,2,1170,4.862944162436548

For those familiar with Conan the Barbarian, this is something similar. Nekron, the Mage lord and Master of Ice Keep uses his powers to push his glacial kingdom southward in order to take over and destroy all who oppose him. He does have a problem. The only king to stand against him is Jerol, the Ruler of FireKeep. Nekron's plan is to subjugate FireKeep by kidnapping his daughter, Teegra. However,plans do go slightly awry as Teegra manages to escape and encounters Larn, a youth from a village destroyed by Nekron's ice. When they encounter a monstrous water beast Larn is injured and Teegra recaptured by Nekron's ""Dogs"" the subhuman people who serve him. Larn encounters DarkWolf,a mysterious warrior who also seeks revenge on Nekron and is helped by him. Teegra again escapes but is found by Roliel, a beautiful witch who lives in the forest. Roliel attempts to bargain with the Dog soldiers, but she and her son are killed and Teegra is taken at last to Ice Keep, where she is offered as a bride to Nekron. Spurned by Nekron, she is literally tossed aside where she discovers later to her horror, that her brother and his small entourage are dead and tossed in with her. Larn attempts to find Teegra but is captured and imprisoned by Nekron and it is Teegra who finds him and he manages to escape, but loses Teegra in the process. He and DarkWolf meet up and head to FireKeep to warn Jerol that Nekron is coming. Mounted on Dragonhawks, DarkWolf and Larn return to lead an attack on IceKeep and while Larn finally finds Teegrs, DarkWolf attacks Nekron to exact his own vengeance. Because the glacier is so close to FireKeep, Jerol releases the lava. Do Larn and DarkWolf escape? Does Teegra get back home? If you can find this movie, then you'll know. I still like animation before computers took over, and while CGI can be pretty impressive,old school hand drawn had its charms and rotoscoping was as close as one could get to real life, unless it was stop motion film work, because it took from real life. Stunt people did the action which was laboriously transferred to screen and what we see is taken from the work that everyone did. Bakshi was an innovator at a time when animated films were ""Family pictures"" only and Disney had a stranglehold on the G-rated realm. Films like ""Fritz the Cat"" ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Fire and Ice"" were not meant at all for children, and therefore had fewer constraints. Now, they might seem somewhat tame,but for many, these midnight movies, still hold the appeal they once did because they broke the mold and proved that animation could be more than just a place for the kiddies to go and play.

The last time I saw this movie, before this DVD was on an old VHS tape that I was happy to buy many, many years back. I liked having the story and all the great animation captured in a way I could re-watch it as often as I wanted. I would have purchased the DVD eventually, but when I saw the two-disk limited edition I was sold as my before mentioned VHS had died a while back (guess that happens when you like to let it run in the background most weekend).
The story is a bit of the basic save the princess from the invading army sort of tale. But being an old, old D&D players I see it like an adventure played with two people, the DM and a single player. I did these sort of things with my friends a lot back in the day. The main character is a young barbarian who is a sole survivor of his village and does a good job with the poor hand he is dealt. In his adventure he runs across the captured but escaping princess, a feature I didn't notice much when I was younger. He didn't have to save her originally, she had gotten away on her own. I might have to remember that next time someone goes on a rant of the damsel always having to be rescued, then again her costume gave my mom palpitations when she saw what my brother and I were watching.
The young barbarian looses the girl at one point, random monster encounter and when he is able to get his wits about himself he finds that rescuing her lines up with his original goal of revenge. In his hunt for her he is attacked again but this time he is rescued by the powerful Jaguar God (I don't remember his name being specified, but it looks like him) and they team up for a bit. The stronger of the two wanting the main baddie while the younger barbarian will be doing good to get back his princess and taking the biggest bite out of the enemy as he can in the process.

2164644,5,B000638PIU,"A Visual Feast:  The Sun Will Shine on its Artistry

I'll start with one caveat:  This film takes on much more importance to me than it used to in the wake of Frazetta's passing. That being said, there's still the question of where this work stands for today's audience. If you're a fan of fantasy, if you're an artist or animator, or, definitely, if you're a fantasy-artist, you need and should watch this film to see the collaboration of a great artist who more than once admitted ""I didn't care what people thought"" and an animator who pushed toward the top tier but wanted more than anything else to, in the end, do his own thing. What Bakshi-Frazetta brings you is an absolute visual feast. The story is pretty simple and comparable to other Bakshi stories (especially Wizards):  evil queen Juliana cajoles her insipid son Nekron to conquer King Jarol's firekeep with smaller, ulterior motives part of the bargain, such as keeping subhumans completely in their thrall; capturing Princess Teegra (Jarols' daughter) for the production of Nekron's heir, etc; two heroes, Larn and Darkwolf, are the only two people truly noble and fully courageous enough to stand in their way. The writing chores were done by long-time Stan Lee favorite Roy Thomas and perennial comic guru Gerry Conway; the story is credible, better than passable but not anything earth-shattering. Again, the storyline is mostly a vehicle for the art, is mostly action, has a slight bit of intrigue and ends leaving you with some moral questioning about, perhaps, the first moment when history turned the corner from outright animal primitivism to flaming the divine spark of right action. The artwork, though, is superb. Even though I knew that I was watching animated drawings merely running across captured images of Frazetta's paintings, I soon forgot it and was caught up in the broad sweep of grand landscapes and ancient era panoramas. And this is what Frazetta-Bakshi accomplish the most here. They create a setting that is truly fascinating where imagined vicarious experience truly becomes visceral. This film attempts to drop you into its world, and I think it succeeds in doing so. But I'm a child of the 70s and 80s, and I truly enjoy this kind of vicarious fantasy. I also appreciate that Bakshi and Frazetta take the subject matter seriously. There are no gratuitous moments. And though people say this is ""not for the kiddies,"" I honestly don't see why it couldn't be. There are scantily clad females but no moments of sexuality or even sex. The most it could be accused of is sensuality when Teegra stretches on her bed and when we see her swimming. It is, honesty, rather tame and objective. There are many scenes of violence but no blood (honestly:  no blood). All in all, I guess you could call this Logan's Run in the primeval world. The last comment I'll make is that there is no sense buying anything other than the limited edition. If you're going to purchase this (even if you don't know anything about the creators beforehand), you'll want to hear Bakshi's commentary and watch the documentary about Frazetta.

2164649,1,B000638PIU,"Rather than revise after viewing ""Painting with Fire,"" the Frazetta bio, I'll just add a few notes about it here. It's not a very professional film -- the sound is garbled at times and the color often flat -- but it's loving without being reverent, and a lot of fun. Not worth $20 (what I paid for the 2 DVD set), but watch for it in used bins.
===================

Mercy but this is an awesomely bad buy. I haven't watched the Frazetta bio on the second DVD, but I don't know how it could be good enough to balance the sheer awfulness of Fire and Ice. Setting aside the really ugly politics of the film (it manages to be racist, sexist, and homophobic with the gusto of a gang of guys in soiled T-shirts drinking beer in a poorly lit bar), it is incoherent and visually pedestrian. How the wick do you make Frazetta visually pedestrian? Bakshi should get a special award... and a defamation suit from the Frazetta family.

The storyline makes an adolescent D&D game seem like Tolkien. The kingdom of fire (run by an elderly Hulk Hogan clone) is fighting the evil kingdom of ice (run by a stereotypically gay Elric of Melnibone clone) and losing. But at all costs, they must not use lava!! Except at the end, they do. Uh, what? One character swims underwater to a place that is apparently hundreds of miles from where she went into the water to escape a gang of ice guys, but the ice guys find her again anyway. A major character, finally identified in the credits as ""Dark Wolf"" and the only non-Aryan in the film who isn't a grunting moron, turns up whenever needed to rescue the hero (say what?) and heroine. He's the ultimate deus ex machina. At one point, he shows up on an island the rest of them took a ship journey to reach.... The heroine spends most of her time jiggling, and without chiaroscuro, it's about as reminiscent of Frazetta's delightful bimbos as a drawing above a latrine. The denouement begins with the heroine, who has spent the entire movie, including days in a fortress of ice, wearing a sheer bikini with enough fabric, total, to make a square of toilet paper (She does mention at one point that it's cold), exhorting the pale lavender villain to ""take her hand in peace."" Oh yeah, Right. And the ice king has unlimited magic powers, but chooses to fight the hero with a sword. Oh, and not to give anything away, when they are inconvenient to finishing the plot, his powers are suddenly NOT unlimited except nobody explains how or how come.

The movie is accompanied by a sweaty ""Making of"" film in which Ralph Bakshi guffaws about keeping pictures of the ""200"" women who stripped for him to audition for the heroine, compares Frazetta to Rembrandt (""I mean,"" he concludes, ""thing kabowdit! I got to work wit' frickin' REMbrandt!!"" Yeah right. And lots of footage about the revolutionary cartooning technique (Rotoscoping, which did wonderful things for Betty Boop before I -- or Bakshi -- was born) that results in realistic body movement superimposed on landscapes and scenery flat as a Saturday morning He-Man cartoon.

Now, I was not expecting Tolkien (though I shudder to think what the Bakshi aesthetic made of Lord of the Rings), but this film was both inane and revolting. Which is quite a hat trick. For all its hommages to Frazetta's art (""Dark Wolf"" is ""The Death Dealer,"" as Bakshi reminds us repeatedly, and one or two scenes are effectively plagiarized from Conan covers), what Bakshi has preserved here is not the glorious fantasy artist, but Frazetta's crude and occasionally charming doodles.

It is animated of course although the characters are rotoscoped (real actors which are painted over on the film) so it is pretty fluid. The people are scantily clad especially the heroine who is in a thong bikini almost the entire length of the DVD. The hero wears something that covers just a little more but not much more. Some people are offended for whatever reason so I'm stating it.

As for me, it's a good addition to my collection where I'll probably watch it again when I need a light escape from the world.",1329609600,,691,4.3076923076923075

2164652,3,B000638PIU,"Is it possible to love something and hate something at the same time???  With Ralph Bakshi's ""Fire and Ice"" the answer is a resounding 'Yes'.

Ralph Bakshi--he who revived the Lord of the Rings saga and who made Spiderman a curious afterthought in his own cartoon series--teams up with Fantasy fixture Frank Frazetta to bring you ""Fire and Ice"", and make no mistake, Bakshi is running his usual playbook without mercy.

Let's see:

--He uses the same title fonts previously used in Lord of the Rings.

--It has a very similar musical score used previously in Lord of the Rings.

--The roto-scope technique of animation using live-action overlayed with unshadowed animation cells.

--The Villain is an Elric-esq character named Nekron (a retread name from a much more interesting ""Nekron 99"" in Wizards)

--You have Generic Fantasy Guy II named Dark Wolf (again a retread of the name ""Black Wolf"" from Wizards)

and on and on.

This movie really has no reason to exist, other than play othen poplar cinematic trends at the time and glorify Frazetta's bulging muscle, unclothed and unshod take on the fantasy genera.  The plot is your standard fantasy fare, the characters are as thin and flat as the plastic they're painted on (and, given Princess Teegra's ""perky"" anatomy, that's saying something). The Villains are ridiculous and rather pointless and the ending so predictable you might as well not even watch.

Yet, I keep coming back for more.

Why do I keep coming back for more??

I watched this on Netflix, gave it 1 star, and then immediately bought it on Amazon. I utterly hate it when I'm watching, yet I think about it when I'm not.  Princess Teegra, barefoot and pretty much naked throughout the film, is an insult to womankind everywhere, yet I find myself facinated with her.  How weird is that??

This is one of those select films that, despite its endless flaws and general unwatchability, manages to install itself in your soul and not let go.

2164659,4,B000638PIU,"Fire and Ice is a fun movie with plenty of action.  It was filmed rotoscoped (Live actors that are painted over with anamation) which gives the action a very fluid movement.  The plot is so simple you might have to turn your brain off to enjoy it.  The evil wizard Mekron and his mom are trying to rule the world by magicly pusing this glacier over their enemies.  It is up to the kingdom of Firekeep to stop them.  In the middle is Teegra, a curvy knockout of a pricness, who is kidnaped by Mekrons ape men soldiers.  She meets a man named Larn who tries to rescue her. There is also a totally BAD-A$$ warrior named Dark Wolf.  More on him later.
A lot of the reviews say this movie is adolescent drek but here is where the movie does somthing different.  Although Larn is the leading man he is really not that tough.  Infact he spends most of his time running away and fails to rescue Teegra twice.  So even though Larn is the leading man, Dark Wolf is the leading butt kicker, and it is a joy to watch him chop through bad guys with his battle ax.  Infact thats all he does.  He wears a wolf mask for reasons we don't know, and wants to kill Mekron and his mom for reasons he doesn't tell.  There is alot in this movie that doesn't get explained, like how can people ware speedoes and live in a glacier without getting frost bite.  Maybe thats why Mekron and his mom have blue skin.
Anyway, if you think fat bottomed girls make the world go round, and would like to see a beef cake barbarian mow down bad guys with an ax then this is a movie for you.  However, if you are like some of the weenies on this board who call this movie ""sexist"" and who actually don't want to see a hot girl in a lavender bikini then give this one a pass and go back to letting your wife force you watch Steel Magnolias.",1272585600,2,1801,4.135057471264368

The script, which is fairly stock pulp fantasy fare, is provided by veteran comics writers Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, who had a lot of experience with this sort of thing from Marvel's Conan series.  The animation is good for the era, but of course, it's over twenty years old and pre-computer animation.  Certainly the rotoscoping provides a versimilitude of motion that will surprise those that only remember TV cartoons from the era.

Overall, for fans of adventure fantasy, particularly in the comic book vein, Fire and Ice is highly enjoyable, if not particularly deep, and a testament to what interesting things here being done in the fringes in the days when film animation was virtually synonymous with Disney in the American mind.",1256256000,,969,5.0375

The animation that was so good way back when this was made looks pretty silly now.  But the worst part is how dirty the film is.  It looks like the source film was stored on the floor of a garage in the Sahara.  There is so much dirt on just about EVERY frame of the film that it becomes VERY distracting.

There is a 15 minute ""making of"" documentary that is even more laughable.  Before the documentary starts, there is a screen that explains that they could not find any of the original ""making of"" material.  So they resorted to transferring the personal VHS copy of Ralph Baskshi.  I guess it's better than nothing, but the quality is so bad that it's pretty hard to watch.

2164669,3,B000638PIU,"What you have here is swords and sorcery cel-animated movie with all the style of Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian. Bakshi collaborated with famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta in making the imagery of this movie and it shows. While the story itself is basic and there isn't much character development there is an intelligence to this movie that stands out above just about all of the barbarian movies made even up to now (with the original Conan being the only exception).

They use a rotoscoping technique that gives the animation a lifelike fluidity found in some of the classic Disney movies like Sleeping Beauty, but keep in mind this is by no means a Disney movie. In other words: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. There is a heck of a lot of violence and scantily clad people on this picture. While it is rated PG I think by today's standards it's more PG-13.

Now this movie was released on DVD a few years back and with that a Two Disk Limited Edition came out that included all of the features in this Blu-Ray plus one major bonus that puts the BR disk to shame. FRAZETTA: PAINTING WITH FIRE is an amazing hour and a half documentary of artist Frank Frazetta that alone is worth getting that DVD release. Why they didn't make room for the Blu-Ray I don't know, but it's enough to keep me from buying it.

The only thing you get here you didn't get elsewhere is the DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD lossless audio tracks. The video is of course the sharpest available, but there are still bits of ""dust"" (for lack of a better word) that are inherent in the source film. To me a good upscaling DVD player will give you just about the same fidelity considering this is an animated film with low res backgrounds to begin with.

As a hack and slash, barbarian warrior kind of movie this is great. If you loved Conan the Barbarian, The Beastmaster and other movies of this sort then you will love Fire and Ice. As a Blu-Ray release I say don't do it. Get, or keep, the Limited Edition version as this is still the best value.",1253145600,9,2022,4.456756756756757
2164670,1,B000638PIU,"There was a certain time in the 1980s when barbarian fantasy movies were the movie trend du jour, which is presumably how Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta got the go-ahead for ""Fire and Ice."" It's basically a gauzy wisp of a plot that is filled with hilariously cheezy dialogue, semi-nude damsels and other fun things dredged from the imagination of a 13-year-old swords-and-sorcery geek.

After the Ice Age, evil queen Julianna and her son Nekron (?!?!?!) decided to conquer the world with his giant telekinetically-controlled iceberg. The only place they haven't squished or conquered is Firekeep, so they kidnap King Jarol's almost-naked daughter Teegra -- but she escapes, and ends up encountering Larn, a strapping young barbarian whose village was wrecked by Nekron. They fight, she runs away, and two minutes later they're prepped for the horizontal mambo.

But after a Random Monster Attack knocks Larn out, our inept hero wakes to find that Teegra has been taken by Juliana's subhuman minions. So he joins forces with a mysterious hooded man named Dark Wolf, who apparently is POed at Julianna for reasons never explored in-story, and wants to kill Nekron (again, for reasons never explored in-story). Together they plan to take back Teegra and save the world, blah blah blah.

""Fire And Ice"" is is basically your run-of-the-mill barbarian fantasy story, so it doesn't have much of a plot beyond Save The Shapely Damsel And Defeat The Threat Against The World. Blatant sexism (""Waa, nobody takes me seriously, so I'll roll around in a string bikini!""), hinted racism, a designated Evil Gay Villain, and a seemingly endless list of plot holes (Teegra is unable to escape an OVERHAND KNOT?) and inconsistencies (why can subhumans scale a cliff but not a TREE?).

And the whole thing is CHEESY. The dialogue is cheesy (""You may have caught me, but you'll never give me to Nekron!""), the monsters are cheesy (pirouetting kraken attack!), and the cheesiness of the climax could make enough grilled sandwiches to feed the entire world for a year. And it's pretty funny at times in its earnestness, with dialogue filled with unintentionally hilarious moments (""Give me your love,"" Teegra's dad says to his almost-naked daughter) and action scenes (two guys in speedos whacking each other with swords! Hello Freudian symbolism!).

And the whole thing is done with mind-blowing seriousness. Well, except for a few scenes of sexual symbolism that just have to be tongue-in-cheek -- like Nekron writhing and screaming as his magically upthrusting pillars of ice explode in sprays of liquid. That can't possibly be serious.

The reigning character here is Dark Wolf, a butt-kicking and level-headed guy who wears a cat-eared executioner's mask and STILL looks tough. He also sneezes more brain cells than our hero ever did -- despite being The Designated Hero, Larn never actually succeeds in anything he does. And Teegra is basically there to scamper around the woods in a child's string bikini and writhe around suggestively to get male attention, like a pornographic Snow White.

""Fire and Ice"" runs neither hot nor cold -- it's just a vast oozing mass of cheese, with lots of naked women and vaguely offensive undertones. But it's tailor-made for a nice drinking game.",1252540800,10,3275,5.0762081784386615

The movie has done VERY well making the jump from vhs to dvd. Nothing is missing at all. And the bonus disc has a documentary about THE fantasy illustrator of all time,Frank Frazetta! Very interesting to watch. All In all,just a great movie to add to your collection. I've been looking for this for years after my vcr ate my tape. I was so happy when i found it here on dvd!

The character creations in this movie is nothing short of a masterful piece of work! If your looking for any 1 reason to buy this movie(guys),
""Teegra"" in her barely there outfit is worth the price of admission alone! There's also another woman at the beginning of the movie in a skimpy outfit(not quite as skimpy as Teegra's, but very nice) where you get a very brief rump shot when the subhuman hits her in the back of her legs with the handle part of his spear. The redhaired witch in the movie is very nice as well! All perversion aside though, if your a comic book fan or just love anything to do with animation and mythical storytelling, Fire & Ice is a great addition to your video collection!

2164684,1,B000638PIU,"Fire and Ice (Ralph Bakshi, 1983)

Sometimes I wonder what on earth filmmakers were thinking when they made movies. More often, I wonder what I was thinking when I was enthralled with them. In this case, though, I don't need to do either--when Fire and Ice came out, I was fourteen years old, male, and not terribly experienced with the opposite sex--in other words, I was Ralph Bakshi's exact target audience. Now I'm thirty-eight, married, and have a more encyclopedic knowledge of eighties and nineties exploitation cinema (read: porn) than I'm sure anyone in my family would like to acknowledge; rewatching Fire and Ice these days, I look back and grieve that my fourteen-year-old self had such bad taste. (But then, in 1983, my all-time favorite movie was Deathsport. No, I can't explain it either.)

Fire and Ice, which All-Movie Guide calls ""Bakshi's last stab at epic fantasy"", concerns two kingdoms, the established human kingdom ruled by fire, and the upstart kingdom of outcasts and half-breeds, the kingdom of Ice. Needless to say, one is wise and good, and the other is twisted and evil. Interestingly, there are a few places in the script where denizens of either kingdom could waver from their one-dimensionality and suddenly bring depth and richness to the script; we're dangling there waiting for Bakshi to drop the apple into our mouths, but of course it's snatched away as quickly as it's offered. Cruel, I tell you. But then, no one's supposed to be paying attention to the script; we're supposed to be too busy, erm, ""watching"" Tigre (voice of Cynthia Leake), who starts the movie wearing something that looks as if it's supposed to be a diaphanous lavender negligee over a couple of pieces of filmy stuff that pass as underwear. But only for the first third of the movie, after which the negligee-thing goes away. Draw some luscious, and entirely unrealistic, curves, and the audience's collective brain will be interested in nothing else; at least, this seems to have been the thinking behind this production. (Add in a cameo from Batman--and I swear, the character looks like the ancestor of the animated version of Batman from the seventies--and you'll kill off the last few collective brain cells still struggling to recover from the onslaught of Tigre-flesh.)

But the worst part is that, after realizing all this, I still sat through the entire eighty-one minutes this weekend. I'm pretty sure I didn't drool, but there may be some extra gaps in the gray matter I should probably have my doctor take a look at. *",1182729600,16,2540,4.902325581395349

If it was a one-hour movie, it probably would have been more entertaining.  The Big Bad Evil Ice Guy is attempting to conquer the Good Guy Fire King, but most of the time is spent with the Fire King's scantily clad, fantasy-proportioned princess running from ape-like soldiers and being rescued over-and-over by a sole-surviving warrior from one of her father/king's tribes.  It all wraps up very quickly in the end.  If you like Frazzetta, then you'll notice this is a whole movie of his paintings in rotoscoped animation.",1180051200,3,629,4.850467289719626

I admit that I enjoyed this film, although I would not pay dvd price for this film and would proably get the VHS version as long as it was in the 1-2 dollar range (plus shipping).  It's not so much that this film is bad (in fact it is a good film), it's just that unless you have money to burn, or really like this film, there are a lot of adult themed cartoons that are just as good if not better than this one - like ""Heavy Metal"", or the modern HeMan TV series (not to be confused with the HeMan series of the 80's).

The plot seems to be similar to that of star wars.  I noticed that in many sword and sorcery flicks from the 80's seem to have this theme (like deathstalker for instance), where you have a warrior or warriors battling a powerful wizard.

Just get Poser 5 or higher, a good animation software package (ToonBoom seems to be leading) and work out a storyboard.  Then, have the 3D figs act out the basic moves and trace over them, using the computer to extend your art style.

Too high? Perhaps, but in comparison to other animated films this one falls pretty short of decent (check out truly great animated films like ""Princess Mononoke"", ""The Secret of Nimh"" and ""The Iron Giant"" to see what I mean). The rotoscoping technique bothered me not one wit. The background stills paintings provided by Thomas Kinkade (""Painter of Light"") and James (""Dinotopia"") Gurney are gorgeous for the most part. The character designs are good enough. The story is, well, horrid. Thomas and Conway present the worst cliches in this tale that is so simple it's hard to believe even a first year grad student could mess it up. Then there are the animaters who, apparently decided to rachet up the oomph factor for Tigra. It's bad enough that she's realized as a flighty, air-head of a princess with no redeemable value but then her over-endowed body in some shots are just outrageous(trying to draw like Frazetta is a lost cause; animators, note his thick wrists and compact builds, please, it ain't easy imitating a lifetime of established skills). The hero, Lar, is a pretty tough character but he also is victim to awkward dialogue and ridiculous escapes. And why is everyone in the frozen ""Ice Keep"" dressed for a day at the beach, a hot day at the beach to boot? The only characters worth their credits are Steve Sandor as Darkwolf (Frazetta's Death Dealer, slumming perhaps?) and Leo Gordon as King Jerol (sp?). The rest of the cast have their moments but they are all too brief. There are some great fight scenes. There are times when the action is nothing short of breathtaking. Then the characters start speaking again and it's ""ARGH..!!"" time all over again.

This animated film pretty much proves to me that the true dream projects are not the ones I anticpate, but instead are the ones I haplessly discover. I wished after all these years of not seeing it I would rediscover a scratched but worthy gem. I come away thinking instead, how could they have screwed this up? Another potentially wonderful film deserving the discount bin treatment.

The second disc ""Painting with Fire"" is the real reason to own this disc set. This, well thought out and beautifully flawed attempt to put Frank Frazetta's life into perspective is inspired and enjoyable. It could have used a bigger budget and more art but it is beyond a doubt one of the best documentaries about an artist that I've seen.

2164691,3,B000638PIU,"You know that saying, you can't go home again? That's how I felt watching this old favorite from my teen years.

The cliche-ridden story, written by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway (the guys who are best known for giving us the Conan the Barbarian comic books, and who, along with Frank Frazetta, helped revitalize interest in Robert E. Howard's famed barbarian back in the '70's), is as bad as a plate of week old chinese food that's been left out in the sun. Not a lot of plot, other than the usual: There's a cranky, momma's boy-evil wizard out to dominate the world, and his domineering mother, who - mistakenly - believes that her - uh - gay, purple-skinned son is somehow in need of a consort, goes and kidnaps a buxom, medievally bikini-clad babe for him (Although they admittedly look fantastic, I've never quite understood why bikini's are the favored jungle wardrobe staple of the buxom-babe/damsel in distress, but there you go). The evil wizard, obviously not the least bit interested, imprisons the hottie in his dastardly mountain lair while he pursues his real passion for total jungle domination. Eventually, the wizard is satisfyingly vanquished by a pair of lusty, muscle-bound savages, and the gorgeous babe is rescued (bikini relatively intact - this is a PG-rated sword & sorcery epic, after all).

Stretching the cheesiness factor is the crummy, saturday-morning cartoonish rotoscoping animation from Director Ralph Bakshi; a cheap, time-saving technology that was panned as cheating even back in the early '80's, and which, incredibly, even manages to overwhelm and deaden the character designs from the great Frank Frazetta.

As for the extras, there's some cool stuff. With the amazing, full-length Frazetta documentary 'Painting With Fire' (also available as a separate, stand-alone DVD) included on the second disk, the extra's are almost enough to justify the $30 expense, even if the actual film hasn't aged so well. The commentary track with Bakshi - who I really do like - is fun, and the old guy still seems frisky and as interested in filmmaking as he was twenty and thirty years ago. The making of documentary is pretty typical stuff, as is the behind-the-scenes still gallery, and the Diary Notes from voice-actor Sean Hannon is a throwaway addition to the package.

The film transfer for the Limited Edition is fine. My old VHS copy had worn out long ago, and it was great to see Fire and Ice in the widescreen format, even if the movie in my memory seems just a little more exciting than the real thing.",1153180800,3,2536,4.9044289044289044
2164692,5,B000638PIU,"I have been a long time fan of both Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta.  I only wished that they had teamed up for more than just Fire and Ice.  The additional Disc with the Frazetta story adds a new insight to an artist that I have admired for a long time.  Ralph Bakshi has made movies in his own unique style.  The two together make a good team.

The storyline progresses rapidly from the action packed start till the very end.  About half way through the movie I started seeing it as a Western and the tough stranger, DarkWolf, reminded me of the Clint Eastwood character from ""For a Fistfull of Dollars.",1152316800,4,605,4.357142857142857
2164693,5,B000638PIU,"Now dig this man, Frank Frazetta is the greatest fantasy artist of our time. Seriously, he and Arthur Rackham are my two favorite artists ever. And Ralph Bakshi is an excellent B-movie animator with a distinctive style of animation called rotoscoping, where you paint over live action film, whic creates very cool and realistic character movements. Now imagine these two forces of nature, Bakshi and Frazetta, fused together. Incredible backgrounds, insane mind-bending monsters, and outstanding character animations. On previous Bakshi films the live action film bleeds through, not so on Fire and Ice, the vibrant Frazetta-esque colors suck you into the world of the movie. Unfortunatley, the plot is so lame you don't even need to listen to the dialogue to follow the movie. Thats kind of a blessing, since the voice acting is barely passable, but it is bearable.

  The film is a two disk set, one disk has the Fire and Ice movie as well as lots of cool special features, the second disk is the Frazetta documentary Frazetta: Painting with Fire. This is a ridiculousy excellent movie chocked full of paintings, drawings, and highlighting Frazetta's laid back but very cool life.

  Final Judgement: Watch it once, ogle the beautiful Teegra, and then check out the sweet special features. Then watch it again with the sound off and some Jefferson Airplane playing ;)",1152057600,4,1369,5.062222222222222
2164694,5,B000638PIU,"Many folks seem to dismiss this animated masterpiece as simply a dated adolescent fantasy that isn't worth watching because it doesn't meet today's ""high standards"" of storytelling and computer animation.  (Like the Matrix trilogy or Lord of the Rings...I really think Keanu should of won that oscar...oh, nevermind)

I think that when you look at Fire and Ice in the light of the work that it represents and the audience that it was intended for, you would see that this film stands as one of the finest examples of animation in this genre.  The animation is hewn through the effort of human hands, at a FPs rate that is competitive with anything done in MAYA or Lightwave.  If you look at the true masterpieces of animation produced by studios such as Disney, WB, and H-B, you will find that nothing that has been produced in the past 20 years comes close to to fluidity and artistic beauty of Snow White, Merrie Melodies, or Fritz The Cat.  Fire and Ice was made during a period of exploration where Ralph Bakshi was attempting to use techniques that would expand the abilities of animators to reach beyond what had been done and create new avenues through which thier stories could be told.  If you don't like this film, then the chances are that you are ""out of the loop"" when it comes to animation and its place in society as art.  Or, perhaps, your fandom of the fantasy/scifi genre was never the target of this piece, and would be much better suited for something more passive like Moorcock or McCffery.  Maybe, someday, they'll make a cute little Elric movie or a ""Wheel of Time"" trilogy.",1151971200,3,1597,4.638297872340425
2164695,3,B000638PIU,"Possibly the least ambitious film of Ralph Bakshi's career, ""Fire and Ice"" is a middling sword-and-sorcery epic with one-dimensional characters, a hackneyed story, crummy acting and awful dialogue.  But what would be laughable or simply unwatchable in live action proves passably entertaining in animation.

Renowned fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta is listed as a co-producer, but his influence seems more apparent in the garish background work (much of it painted by Thomas Kinkade) than in the flat character designs.  Still, ""Fire and Ice"" features several nicely staged action sequences, and William Kraft's melodramatic score makes the story seem more consequential than it is.  Even Bakshi's rotoscope work, with its clumsy mimicry of live-action cinematography, has an unexpected primitive charm.

Alas, ""Fire and Ice"" is as racist, sexist and homophobic as movies get, which may explain why 20th Century Fox buried the flick in 1983.  Since then, Bakshi fans have had to make do with cheap pan-and-scan VHS tapes or homemade dubs from late-night TV.  For them, this 2-disc DVD edition, which finally presents ""Fire and Ice"" in its proper widescreen ratio, will be well worth the steep purchase price.  For nonfans, this modest effort will demonstrate what can be done by a handful of talented and ambitious personnel with a shoestring budget, but otherwise doesn't merit so much as a passing glance.",1147046400,8,1410,5.34841628959276
2164696,5,B000638PIU,"This brilliant and fun film is not one of the highly polished, heavily funded and supplied annual ski extravaganzas that Warren Miller, Inc. (God bless him) churns out endlessly.  This film is a one-off, a romp for both the skiers and the filmmakers, and it's an enduring classic.  This is the classic ski resort party movie, the one that was being shown on the wall in the lodge at the end of the day, the one film that the tiny resort theater would run all week long, for the entire winter.  This film harkens back to the true mountain-hippie ski days of the 70s, when skiing was alternative and rare, something for the jet set and something for those bearded long-hairs, up there on them hills.

As for theatrical creativity, it's pretty straightforward.  Young ski stud gets only a glimpse of early 80s blonde Ultimate Ski-Hottie Suzy Chafee, and the chase is on.  There's no stopping him--and a lot of things get in his way--until he can track her down and bond with her as only skiers can.  The action goes from NYC to Aspen, with lots of gags and fun along the way.  Happy ending?  You betcha.

There are a lot of great ski stunts here, but keep in mind that this film was made in the early 80s, when the technological revolution in skiing was really just beginning.  This was back when folks were still skiing on 200cm K2 Cheeseburgers direct from Vashon Island, and when the height of technological innovation were the new Look rear-entry boots and those wacky multi-directional bindings with integrated ski brakes.  If you're after wicked ski and snowboard shredding, extreme descents and crashes, with jarring jump-cut edits all set to a relentlessly pounding thrash-metal soundtrack, then you'll be disappointed.  This film was made before that became the de facto ski film approach.  This is a series of linked vignettes, some funny and some serious, but all extremely entertaining.

Bottom line:  If you're an old-school skier, anyone who started in 1985 or before, then you'll immediately identify with and enjoy this film.  If you're into skiing for recreation, and appreciate its fundamental form and function, the meeting of base to snow, of the majesty of interacting with the mountain regardless of ability or experience, then you'll dig this film.  If you're a little kid (say, under 10), just picking up skiing (even boarding), the sight gags and stunts will keep your attention and entertain you.  But, if you're a youngster bred on attitude-driven board shredding and park-posing with your MP3 blasting, down the couloir and obsessed with first descents, anything off the groomed trail, then this film will flat-out bore you to tears.",1140652800,4,2658,4.879732739420936
2164697,4,B000638PIU,"I saw this for the first time in 1987.  I don't know how it escaped my attention when it first came out.  I was a huge Frazetta fan back then and this would be a dream come true.  I watched it over and over on a taped copy I made from Cinemax.  It was a bad tape but I loved it.  Now almost twenty years later it's not as great as I remember but it also hasn't aged as badly as I was expecting.  The thing that struck me most was the heavy lines on the characters.  The characters almost looked like a Hanna Barbara cartoon.  They reminded me of the Superfriends or Space Ghost.  There is an odd mix of poor quality drawings and some pretty compelling art.  The rotoscoping is a neat technique and it makes for some good action scenes.  And some of the background art is spectacular.

The plot is paper thin but no worse then some live action films I've seen.  The voice acting reminded me a lot of the first Heavy Metal movie.

Fire and Ice is an interesting movie if you're a fan of Frank Frazetta or into fantasy and animation.

The thing that makes this DVD worth the purchase is the documentary ""Painting with Fire"" about Frank Frazetta.  When I was younger I had a few books of his works that I would memorize.  His art meant a lot to me and his life is fascinating.  I never realized how tough his early years were.  You just assume a giant talent like this was getting rich right off the bat.  It turns out he was struggling and some lucky breaks helped to launch his career.  He's been through a lot of adversity but bares it with an upbeat optimism.  After six strokes he had to learn to paint using his left hand.

It means a lot when the comic greats like Bernie Wrightson, John Buscema, Dave Stevens, Neal Adams are gushing fanboys.  Everyone interviewed has nothing but good things to say about him.  He's apparently a good friend and great father.

The inclusion of the documentary is a valuable bonus that makes the Fire and Ice DVD worth buying.",1137888000,9,1962,4.277929155313352

How come there was never sequels, or more Sword & Sorcery movies made like this? A Conan-like movie like this made nowadays, with today's computer animation, would be bloody spectacular.

But this still holds up for today. Frank Frazetta's timeless artworks holds an appeal that enfolds millions in both breadth and scope. Like may others, it was his wonderful cover artwork that enticed me to read many a paperback novel back in the 70's.

2164699,5,B000638PIU,"-- it doesn't get any better.

The story is straightforward sword and sorcery, kingdom of Fire vs. the evil kingdom of Ice. As in Bakshi's other best movies, it's rotoscoped cel animation over painted backgrounds, a combination I like a lot. That gives completely natural movement to the animated figures, and great atmosphere from the backgrounds.

There were a few negatives in this DVD. First was transfer quality. There's a visible amount of ""snow"" in many places, enough to notice, but not enough to get in the way of the movie. Then there's the inherently loose relationship between the cel animation and the backgrounds - a few scenes seemed to have the characters skating across the surroundings. Excessive reality can also be a drawback. Teegra, the female lead, spent a lot of time running from the bad guys. Unfortunately, she tended to ""run like a girl"" (and I don't mean Jackie Joyner Kersee) - she rarely conveyed the athletic or panicked sense I would have expected of a woman running for her life.

The positives far outweigh the problems, though. Frazetta's characters are richly drawn: lush womanly figures, mighty males, grunting hench-beings, and the Death Dealer. The story holds together, and the rotoscoped actors did great jobs. And the DVD extras - wow. I normally ignore them. These aren't just a few stills and a trailer, there are interviews with Bakshi, diary notes from one of the actors, and a whole second disc dedicated to Frazetta and his work (""Painting with Fire""). I haven't gone through all of the extras yet, but they earned that fifth star for this set.

It's not as ""adult"" as Fritz the Cat and other of Bakshi's work, but it's certainly not for the kiddies, either. But then, not all animation has to be. Highly recommended.

2164702,5,B000638PIU,"This is probably Ralph Bakshi's greatest achievement. What you have here is swords and sorcery cel-animated movie with all the style of Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian. Bakshi collaborated with famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta in making the imagery of this movie and it shows. There is an intelligence to this movie that stands out above just about all of the barbarian movies made even up to now (with the original Conan being the only exception).

They use a rotoscoping technique that gives the animation a lifelike fluidity found in some of the classic Disney movies like Sleeping Beauty, but keep in mind this is by no means a Disney movie. In other words: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. There is a heck of a lot of violence and scantily clad people on this picture. While it is rated PG I think by today's standards it's more PG-13.

The DVD transfer is nice and clean. The making of featurette is actually quite interesting as you get to see how much they put into the material they rotoscope. They used real actors and stuntpeople, in costume, to actually perform all the stuff you see animated. No wonder that the movie has a high level of subtle detail after seeing this featurette. I haven't seen the Frazetta documentary yet, but I keep hearing it's really good. As a hack and slash, barbarian warrior kind of movie this is great. If you loved Conan the Barbarian, The Beastmaster and other movies of this sort then you will love Fire and Ice.",1126483200,8,1464,4.670542635658915
2164703,2,B000638PIU,I bought Frazzetta: Painting with Fire a few months a go. The second disc was awful. The extra features were not that great. It was not worth $25. Now it comes out with Fire and Ice for free. I feel cheated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1125619200,7,233,4.7073170731707314
2164704,5,B000638PIU,"I have an old, worn out copy of this film on VHS and I bought this yesterday. Finally, this great, gritty and violent animated film has been put on DVD. Nobody paid this movie much attention when it first came out, which is not surprising since this film was way ahead of its time.

Even better: the second disc loaded with special features.

Well worth the money.",1125532800,,364,4.417910447761194
2164705,4,B000638PIU,"After over twenty years I finally got to see this movie.  When it came out, it got terrible reviews, and only stayed in theatres for a couple of weeks before being pulled.  Although I initially wanted to see it, I assumed that it did so poorly because it sucked, and I quickly forgot all about it.  Well, all I can say is that I wished that I had took the time to go see it then, because this is by far my favorite Bakshi film.

I won't go into the plot, because 1) other reviewers already have and will, and 2) I hate spoilers.  It basically has the ""Star Wars/Pirates of the Caribbean"" trio of main characters; the gallant but slightly green youth, the jaded rogue with the heart of gold, and the damsal in distress who can hold her own. There's nothing extraordianary or original about it.  Its basically a hero's journey/revenge/boy meets girl story.

But if you're a fan of Frank Frazetta, you have to see this movie.  Many of his most famous images are brought to life.  The princess is right out of the paintings of Dejah Thoris/Cat Girl/Egyptian Queen.  For a cartoon, she's extremely hot and ridiculously curvy.  She also wears an ""A cup"" bra over a pair of double Ds (very Frazetta!).  The hero is obviously modeled after the guy who fought the giant snake on the cover of the old paperback ""Wolfshead"".  The evil queen is right out of the painting ""Sea Witch"", and the thugs are Franzetta's neanderthals.  The bad guy Necron looks like Elric of Melnibone, although I don't recall Frazetta ever painting that character.  Strange.

The audio and video quality is extremely good.  The plot moves at a brisk pace, and the action scenes are exciting and extremely well choriographed.  The rotoscoping is much improved over Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"", which looked cheesy and ""fake"" to me in some of the scenes.

I'm glad I finally got to see this movie, and in my opinion it is worthy of future viewings.  Let's face it, if you like Sword and Sorcery films, there are very few quality titles out there.  Hopefully, with the success of ""Lord of the Rings"", and the advent of CGI, this will be rectified in the future.  In the meantime, its good that titles such as this are finally available.  Highly recommended.",1125446400,8,2220,4.564556962025317

8037975,3,B000638PIU,"The animation was somewhat interesting, but the movie is lacking quite a bit of story. There is very little dialogue and almost no character development to speak of.  Even by the end of the movie we don't know much of anything about the characters or the realm they are living in.  This is especially strange considering there are only really seven characters.  What bothers me more is the overwhelming amount of coincidence in which the few characters keep running into each other by pure unexplained luck, over and over again, despite being in areas that are apparently vast.",1521072000,,577,4.86734693877551
