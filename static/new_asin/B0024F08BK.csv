I am a collector of native American pottery and I own just one piece of Hopi pottery because it is generally exquisite and therefore, expensive.  I was hoping this movie would discuss specific artists with examples of their own pieces.  I found the part of the video about the actual process of creating this art very interesting and informative.

I will purchase this DVD however, to compliment the Hopi piece I currently own.  I believe the more background provided the more valuable the item.",1382486400,,573,4.865979381443299

The music will put you into a trance in which I hope you can keep your eyelids open long enough to make it to the pottery. After some fast forwarding, finally pottery!  Some nice examples.  Gives dates and glazing technique such as polychrome, black on white, etc.  Then the film goes into detailed history. Like this part.",1282867200,,417,4.434210526315789
