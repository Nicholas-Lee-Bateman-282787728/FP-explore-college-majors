For someone like myself, a child growing up in New York right after the end of WWII, with a family who housed and harbored European refugees, gentiles as well as Jewish, artists and intellectuals, just to see this film was a tremendous lift.  It is accurate, dramatic, exciting, sensitive to its unusual subject matter and contains enough of the mysterious nature of this little-known figure of WWII to intrigue one to find out more.  As it happens, I did know a little more as I knew, through my parents, men and women interviewed by Varian Fry, some who he brought to America and some who had to escape through the Eastern route, China.
The re-creations are very well done, the atmosphere is excellent and there is just enough left unanswered to encourage further reading.  Good job well done on a difficult and largely unknown aspect of WWII.
