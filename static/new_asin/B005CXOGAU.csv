4655005,5,B005CXOGAU,"Would it be better if they released this in HD?  Yes, it obviously would.  But I own the 2006 World Series collection from A&E as well and knew ahead of time it would be sold in standard definition.  But I'm a Cardinals lifer since 1988 and there is no chance I wasn't going to purchase this and the other video they sold that was in HD format.  I've watched the 2006 DVD over and over again and can't wait for this to reach my house so I can watch the 2011 World Series over and over again.",1323734400,,491,4.030927835051546
4655006,5,B005CXOGAU,"I understand all the complaints. I believe I am the first to review the actual DVDs. By the fifth inning of the first game, I forgot my issues with picture quality and started to enjoy the games. By most any measure, Game 6 is one of greatest games in World Series history. And that's the way it comes across here, with all the post-game interviews and comments included. In my case, some of the post-game stuff is new because my local station cut in with the ""11 o'clock news."" But, all the games are interesting...seven game World Series with two evenly-matched teams are very rare these days.

I am disappointed with the Bonus DVD, which is a recap of the two playoff series, and a small portion of the Cardinals victory parade. Why bother, if that's all you show?

For Cardinal fans (like me) who are upset about Albert Pujols leaving for the Angels, it was chance to watch Albert for one last time. I am angry about Pujols leaving, but again the World Series is so interesting, he eventually becames just part of an unusally interesting sports event. David Freese, Lance Berkman and Chris Carpenter are the Cardinal heros, except for Pujols's three-homer game.

Give the DVDs a chance!",1323475200,27,1190,4.6571428571428575
4655007,1,B005CXOGAU,"I don't see why the most recent World Series can't be put on Blu-Ray and watched/enjoyed in High Def. I can understand the 1985 or 1979 World Series being DVD only. But with every World Series I've seen since I got an HD TV in 2005 being broadcast in HD, I see absolutely no reason to continue to sell an inferior product like this when better stuff is available.

Personally, I don't like the Cardinals and found Game 6 to be the single worst sports moment since Cabrera and Bream beat the Pirates in 1992. But I think the fans of the Cardinals should be able to enjoy watching the game for years to come in HD. Not an old, out of date format.",1322265600,8,644,4.193548387096774
4655008,1,B005CXOGAU,"While I don't condone people stealing their content, decisions by backward thinking organizations like MLB all but assure that people are going to.  Putting out non-HD content in this day and age is like putting out black and white videos in 1980.  Whoever wants to buy this content wants it in BluRay HD, not DVD.  So these people are going to steal it off the internet to get it in the format that they want because MLB won't provide it.  I truly believe most of these people would pay for it if MLB offered it.  But since they don't, MLB loses money.  Again, I don't condone stealing your content, but I also don't condone paying for this content since it is in a near-defunct format.  Save your money until MLB gets their act together and puts it out in a modern format.",1321747200,19,774,4.408450704225352
4655009,3,B005CXOGAU,"I bought the 2006 edition on DVD and it was great.  I was waiting for this in Hi Def as the entire series was shot that way but alas it does not appear that it will be available.  What gives.  Is MLB losing it.  They have not had Bluray editions of any of the past world series and I would have expected it for at least the last 3.

So disappointed.  Common MLB we what it in high deffinition!!!!!

Oh the games were great and I want to see game 6 over and over again but I still want it on BluRay.

Update: While there is still no BluRay Amazon did lower the price to 31.99 so I finally broke down and bought it.  The games are great and for 32 I can live with DVD but come on MLB they should be in hi-def.",1321488000,11,707,3.820689655172414
4655010,5,B005CXOGAU,"By no stretch of the imagination was this a great World Series, However, it was very, very good. It will not hold a spot with the great series like 1975(Reds/Red Sox) 1986 (Mets/Red Sox) 1991 (Twins/Braves) 2001 (Diamondbacks/Yankees). Rather it will be remembered among some very good series like 1982 (Cardinal/Brewers) 1987 (Twins/Cardinals) 1997(Marlins/Indians) 2002(Angels/Giants). With that said there is no doubt I will be adding it my collection. Game 6 and the great Cardinals comeback makes it worth the purchase. Besides, it was nice to see a class orginazation like The Cardinals win another title. It will be on my self among the other very, very good and great World Series games in my collection.",1321488000,3,712,5.146551724137931

Even if you are not a Cardinals fan (but especially if you are!) this is just the thing to get you through the long winter before the start of spring training.

I last purchased one of these collectors boxes back in 2006 (connect the dots ...).  A new feature since then which is worth mentioning is that you can now choose from a total of four audio tracks: the FOX television broadcast (Joe Buck, Tim McCarver), the Spanish language telecast, and local radio broadcasts from St Louis and Texas.  This is a real treat for fans like me who listen to a lot of games on the radio and enjoy listening to the home town broadcast team call the game -- especially as it is presented here synced up perfectly with the video.  The addition of these extra audio tracks means that you can enjoy each game a number of times from a fresh perspective each time.
