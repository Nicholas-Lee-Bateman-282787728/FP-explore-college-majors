7831230,3,6302769914,"Should you pick up any movie starring Dale Cook, expect three things: (1) dreadful acting, (2) poor production values, and (3) tons of fight scenes. ""Blood Ring"" is only Cook's second film but the formula is already in place, making for a borderline decent kickboxing flick that's not worth spending money on but enjoyable enough should you catch it on television. Outright fans of Dale might consider it one of his better ones.

The story: An alcoholic street fighter (Cook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Kickboxer-2/dp/B00009MEBV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Kickboxer 2</a>) and the widow of his slain comrade (Andrea Lamatsch,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sudden-Thunder/dp/B00004YKMX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sudden Thunder</a>) are pursued by an underworld fight promoter with dark plans for both of them (Don Nakaya Neilsen).

Dramatically, the film falls down on broken legs. Among the entire cast, the only individual who might qualify as any kind of a theatrical performer is Andrea Lamatsch, although this is negated by the fact that she's done her best work in German fare and slings a debilitating accent throughout the picture. With that said, people who get a kick out of this kind of sloppy projecting will have a good time watching the real-life fighters and lifelong extras fumble about with all the grace of a bolo punch. Like almost all of Dale Cook's filmography, this one appears to have been filmed in the Philippines and bears all the aesthetically bland trademarks of movies made there.

The fight content is the film's saving grace - at least to the extent of saving it from a lower rating. There are 17 fight scenes (can't fault Dale for stamina!), and while not all of them are standout fights and almost all are overlong to varying degrees, few are outright chaotic and the cumulative content is a lot better than several of Cook's other movies. Some of the more eye-catching matches include a Hong Kong-inspired randori featuring Steve Tartalia (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-China/dp/B000050B7J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in China</a>), a ring bout between the well-matched Dale Cook and Ned Hourani (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>), and a barbed wire death match between Cook and fellow kickboxer Don Neilsen.

On a bad day, this one would receive the more apt two-star rating - not least of all because of its insistence on turning Andrea Lamatsch's otherwise decent character into a helpless victim - but the good pace allows the viewer to overlook the more tiring parts. If you have the patience for it, this one could be moderately fun.",1428537600,,2862,5.990220048899755
7831231,2,6302769914,"You know when you watch a movie starring Dale ""Apollo"" Cook, it's going to be a rough watch.  Blood Ring is easily one of the worst B-movies I have ever seen.  While there are some redeeming qualities, it's hardly enough to save this painful experience.

Blood Ring has some of the lowest production values i have seen, and quite possibly the worst acting ever (almost as bad as Superfights).  On top of it, the sound eeffects and music can get quite annoying at times.  There is practically no plot and the beating up of and running from goons gets tiresome.  There are quite a bit of fight scenes, several in the ring, but the poor choreography and slow movements don't help with the action excitement.

Here are the redeeming qualities.  Any film you watch after this will seem like an Oscar.  The second, is the final fight of this film was actually kinda neat and original.  If you have seen Kickboxer 1 & 2, then you know that the final fights are fought with broken glass attached to their fists, and blood is shed.  In Blood Ring, the movie's title becomes literall, as Max (Dale Cook) fights his drug lord nemesis, Don Carluco (Don Nakaya Nielsen - possibly the worst actor ever) in a ring with barbed wire wrapped around the ropes and posts.  The fight lasts several minutes and Dale Cook gets in a few nice looking leap kicks and the fight gets pretty bloody.

If you can wait the hour and half (which feels like double that) till the end, the last fight is somewhat fun.  Other than that, this movie sinks to the bottom of the barrel.",1190419200,,1546,4.475
7831232,2,6302769914,"I am a huge martial arts movie buff and don't like to give bad reviews but this is crap. The fight scenes are very unrealistic and sound effects is very poor which is unfortunate because the storyline is good. Susan Dalton (Andrea Lamatsch) is desperately looking for her husband, Philip, who has been missing for months given the run around by the company Philip works for Susan becomes suspicious and requests the help from Max Rivers (Dale 'apollo' Cook) who was once a kickboxing champion but became an alcoholic when Susan married his best friend Philip. When Susan returns having been shot in the search for her husband, Max realizes that this could be something serious. He starts his own investigation and discovers that Philip is involved in an underworld syndicate of martial arts where drug lords indulge in gambling big time. When Max and Susan are caught by the head of the organisation Don Carulco (Don Nakaya Nielsen) he decides to turn Max into one of his money making machines. Max and Susan escape giving Max the time he needs to train and goes back to crush the cold-blooded syndicate and returns to the brutal and final confrontation in the Blood Ring wih Don to finish this once and for all. Good storyline isn't it? But like i said it isn't top notch, but possibly watchable for the very B-Grade movie lovers like myself.",1131408000,,1343,4.719148936170213
