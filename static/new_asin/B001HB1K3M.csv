8308320,5,B001HB1K3M,"Please allow me to preface my review with stating that I have been a
professional photographer of the nude since 1975. This background
has an influence on my review of this dvd.

As someone who has never subscribed to the Playboy channel, this
series was unknown to me before I came across this dvd on Amazon.
The premise intrigued me and I purchased this title.

""San Francisco Treats"" consists of six episodes generally featuring
two individual women per episode. The exceptions are a lesbian
couple in A Gay Old Time and a heterosexual couple in Anything
Goes.

The location is the San Francisco Bay area. The episode titles are:

I. A Gay Old Time
II. Art for Art's Sake
III. Anything Goes
IV. A State of Mind
V. Girl Power
VI. Up Town, Down Town

Andrew Einhorn, a photographer based in New York City, travels to
the San Francisco Bay Area in search of candidates for his photography
books and videos of  ""everyday""women in natural environments. The
series shows Mr. Einhorn approaching  various women in public asking
if they would like to be a part of his photography. We are shown the
rejections and acceptances.from the women he asks to pose for him.

As any photographer knows, the simplest way to locate willing,
non-professional models is when one contacts you by e-mail. Such
is the case with Sandra, age 23, in episode IV. Hers is one of my
favorite segments. Another is Tia who answers a local online ad
Andrew posts in episode V. And Tia is also a favorite segment.

As a photographer who has worked with non-professional models
for about forty years, I enjoyed this dvd but I'm uncertain others
would enjoy it as much. If nudity is all that one is interested in
there are probably myriad videos that are more abundant and
explicit than what is presented here - and women who are more
the stereotypical model for mens' magazines or adult videos (I
have practically no knowledge of the latter). I vastly prefer the
""everyday"" natural woman who is not overly made up, surgically
enhanced, or augmented with tattoos and body piercings (other than
ears). Although ""San Francisco Treats"" features more women than I
would prefer who are tattooed or pierced, the settings and their
exuberance for the photography project makes the body art tolerable
(for me). It depicts one photographer's quest to produce material for his
books and website. We are shown the model-photographer collaboration.
We not only see but also hear from both sides the thoughts that
enter into this creative process.

Mr. Einhorn's personality is pleasant and charming. I respect that
he shows the rejection he encounters as he approaches strangers in
public asking them to pose nude. What I fail to understand is his
occasional persistence with someone after she initially tells him NO.
Those of us who have sought non-professional models over decades
quickly learn about rejection and let it drop fast when it occurs. It's
futile to pursue the matter with anyone who says she's not interested.
Perhaps he is only playing to the camera when he persists. He has
talent as a photographer and really does not need to do it.

In addition to the women posing, the dvd includes some history and
scenic information about the area.. As someone who lived in San
Francisco in the late 1970s, I find this enjoyable. There is a sense
of place, and one can get an idea about a specific woman as she
inhabits this environment.

The dvd case states the total running time is 156 minutes. That is probably
accurate although I did not time each episode. Therefore, there is a lot
of viewing time for the purchase price. That has been a factor in my
overall rating.

This type of video appeals to me due solely to my profession as a
fine-art photographer. I've spent decades working with ""ordinary""
women creating nude photographs. My style is not ""Playboyesque""
or explicit. Andrew Einhorn is depicting similar women who likely
have no aspirations to ever be a professional model. Again, my history
plays a significant part in my assigning this dvd the highest rating. I
hasten to caution that some people will likely not enjoy this dvd if
they are expecting retouched, plastic dreamgirls with elaborate sets
that Playboy has popularized.

My dvd was purchased new in 2011 at a total price near $6.00. I believe
I received good value for my dollars. The highlights for me on this dvd,
other than the travelogue information for the SF Bay Area, are the segments
with Haleigh on Baker Beach, Sandra in a beautiful house and property in Mill
Valley, Tia in her apartment, Lisa in her family's mansion on Nob Hill, and
Vanessa in the hotel where she works.

Each subject appears comfortable with her nudity. That is appreciated
because they are all novice models and there is a film crew present in addition
to Mr. Einhorn. I applaud work like this that celebrates the inherent sexiness
of women without the necessity of elaborate locations or makeup or styling.
These are real women seizing and enjoying an opportunity to reveal
their bodies and individual personalities to the public.

Since I've been taken to task privately for my seemingly
non-acceptance of tattoos and/or piercings let me in closing state
that I'm a fine art photographer who specializes in handcolored
nudes created with black-and-white film. I'm a traditionalist in
that I still work with film and use a wet process darkroom. I do
not utilize Photoshop or other software. I individually handcolor
my black-and-white nudes/portraiture using artist's oils and pencils.
And I do not color other people's artwork - ie. tattoos. It's a
personal preference and I prefer that a model be a ""clean canvas""
if I attempt to create a handcolored image of her on photographic paper.
The women Mr. Einhorn has chosen to photograph are all beautiful.
But some have more artistic appeal to me than others. I admire every
woman who appears in this dvd. I recommend this dvd to anyone who
appreciates women.
