530301,4,6302999588,"I laughed, I cried - ok, I didn't cry, but I definitely laughed - out loud - on a number of occasions.  Moontrap is, quite simply, a hoot and a holler of a film.  How could it not be with Walter ""Mr. Chekov"" Koenig and a young Bruce Campbell taking a wonderfully campy science fiction script and running with it from start to finish?  I will warn you not to judge the film by the opening credits, which feature several minutes of absolutely inane chatter; once you get past that, prepare to be entertained. Spaceflights, aliens that could be the ancient ancestors of the Borg, lunar bases, firefights on Earth and the moon, etc., all of it encased in hilarious banter.  Heck, Koenig even throws in something of a William Shatner impression for no extra charge; in fact, Koenig probably had illusions of Shatner grandeur here as he finally gets some of the spoils that Captain Kirk always kept for himself back in the Star Trek days.

Walter Koenig's character in the film is named Col. Jason Grant, but I'm going to refer to him as Chekov because, let's face it, you can't look at Koenig without thinking of him as Chekov.  Having been too young to fulfill his dream of going to the moon, he flies space shuttles for a living in this futuristic take on 1989.  It's old hat by then, as evidenced by Chekov's co-pilot's penchant for sleeping during flights (that would be Bruce Campbell's Ray Tanner) - until the guys suddenly spot an unknown, derelict spacecraft right in front of them.  By the time they return to Earth, they've got a really dead body and a giant leather football-looking whatsit with them.  It turns out that the body is that of a 14,000-year-old human, and the whatsit contains something incredible and important enough for NASA to pull the last remaining Apollo spacecraft out of mothballs and send Chekov and Ray to the moon, where bigger mysteries await them (and bigger laughs await the audience).  Oh, and there's some little thing about saving the world in there, as well.

On the face of it, the team of Koenig and Campbell doesn't sound like it would work, but Koenig's dead-pan delivery makes for a perfect counterpart to Campbell's over-the-top, exuberant acting.  As funny as the whole movie is, though, it's not all about the comedy.  In its way, Moontrap isn't all that bad of a science fiction movie - well, apart from some huge unanswered questions, sizable plot holes, and random silliness.  There can be no argument about the special effects, though; given the film's low budget, they are really quite impressive.  Put everything together, and you've got a cheesy, campy science fiction classic that garners high marks on the rewatchability scale.",1220227200,3,2683,4.752155172413793
530302,4,6302999588,"It was a little slow at one place, but Bruce Campbell is great!!! The special effects are not bad for a B movie.",1196985600,2,112,3.9130434782608696
530303,3,6302999588,"I watched this movie the first time on TV, probably a decade ago, and remembered being thrilled at the ending, as well as the fact that it had Walter Koenig (Pavel Chekov from Star Trek), but I never found the title. I ran across it recently while looking through Bruce Campbell's IMDB filmography, and recognized the plot immediately. This movie is campy, strangely acted, and absolutely hysterical if you watch it in the middle of the night. Even though it's not the height of cinematic achievement, if you are fond of either of the main actors (Bruce Campbell, particularly, is his usual, bratty self), of old-school sci-fi horror, or just like to make fun of silly movies, you'll probably enjoy this film. I, personally, was pleased to find it again, and I definately enjoyed watching it.",1176249600,6,792,4.830882352941177
530304,3,6302999588,"I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi/Horror movies over the years.  This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.

All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,2,380,4.463768115942029
530305,5,6302999588,"Let me clarify...amzingly CHEESE! This is a movie I saw NUMEROUS times in 89 I think. That was back in the day of the digital video stabiliser, two VCR's and an RCA cable. Get the picture? ANYWAY, I must have seen this film 200 times! Koeing is putting forth the best dead-pan performance of his career! It really showed just how good of an actor he is. His inadvertant (or In your FACE) caracture of his friend Bill Shatner is CLASSIC! No he dosen't do a direct imitation of a certian famous (or infamous) starship captain, but I caught a LOT of the Shatneresque overacting!
Bruce Campbell is in his prime form in this film. His role is just HILARIOUS! He really shows that our favorite grocery clerk is better as an astronaut. Hey, I'd fly in space with him!
This film has it all! Classic Sci-Fi feel, a unique story( Virus was a ripoff of this film), plastic UZI's, inflatible tents, 14,000 year old corpses, and the like. This is a perfect movie to just hit the floor laughing while you wizz in your pants! Definetly worth the time it will take to find this vid.
Unless the release it on DVD. THAT IS A BIG HINT YOU GOOBERS!",1072310400,44,1128,4.376190476190477
530306,3,6302999588,"Let me say one thing first:  I actually like this movie.  I think it's kind of fun and parts of the premise are fresh and interesting.  However.....
I saw this when I was a kid and I was able to buy into it a lot more then.  Then I read Isaac Asimov.  And Heinlein.  And then Arthur C. Clarke.  That killed it.
Part of the premise is interesting and nice and creepy (the idea of robots using humans for parts) but the execution sucks.  This film is so filled with scientific absurdities you don't know whether to laugh or cry.  From the beginning (not noticing a 1/4 mile long ship until it's right on top of them) of the movie to the end (the lunar lander providing the propulsion for a ship about 2,000 its size) this movie breaks not only the laws of physics but also of reality.  If you can completely suspend disbelief you will enjoy this flick as the special effects and the female co-star both look good.  But if you have even the most rudimentary understanding of celestical mechanics or astronomy, you'll crine.
Still, you get to hear Bruce Campbell swear.",1069804800,4,1065,4.410256410256411

530308,3,6302999588,"""Same-old, same-old"" plot of aliens seeking to take over Earth and the heroes of the film who must stop the invasion make this low-budget sci-fi hard to swallow. But a strong cast (Star Trek's Walter Koenig and everyone's ""B"" movie favorite, Bruce Campbell) help lift the movie above its ho-hum existence and is, at least, worth a peek. Koenig and Campbell are astronauts who land on the moon to check out the possibility of alien life. What they find are self-thinking machines bent on hitching a ride in their spacecraft back to Earth to take over the planet, and they must do everything they can to stop them. Some plot holes and unnecessary sequences in the film are chalked up to a weak script, but Koenig has a strong presence in the film and Campbell shines as his partner, stretching his successful acting versatility that much further.",1000080000,10,844,4.7482993197278915
530364,5,6302999588,"I never saw the original version of this film and until recently had never heard about it. I stumbled upon this movie while searching for something else. I got around to watching it this evening.

This version is the 25th Anniversary edition and my wife & I watched it on a large CRT based analog TV (480i resolution). It looked good. I won't go into the details or the plot of the film except to say that it was extremely low budget, low tech, very little by way of special effects. I think the movie succeeded because you don't really notice the lack of those special effects. The plot is original & good. I hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed watching it.

The 25th Anniversary edition besides being available on both DVD and Blu-Ray also includes a pair of interviews done in 2014 with Bruce Campbell (that lasts about 21 minutes) and with Walter Koenig (that lasts just under 33 minutes). The interviews are low-tech as well but provide some background about the actors and about the characters in the movie.",1504224000,,1017,4.521739130434782

I will say that I personally could have done without the gratuitous boob shots that seem to plague R-rated movies, but then I don't fit the male target demographic.

It is a well-made movie, with a good script, passable dialogue and a nice twist in the story and I remember it well. I recently had the fortune of obtaining a copy (sent from the U.S. to the U.K. because it is not available in Europe) and have since re-enjoyed this sci-fi classic. It has held up surprisingly well, with Walter Koenig (Chekov of Star Trek) and Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead) taking the roles of two American astronauts who after encountering a non-human ship in orbit and recovering an artifact from it, have cause for NASA to send them back to the Moon to carry out a Search and Destroy mission on the cold and deadly lunar surface.

530703,3,6302999588,"Let's discuss Bruce Campbell.  Im sure you're all aware: the star of Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987)and Army of Darkness (1992) and yes, a remake of Evil Dead in 2013, in all of which he is the character John Ash.  Evil Dead was so bad it achieved cult status.  His acting was truly terribleas were the plot, the dialog, the cinematographysuch a perfect combination of badness that, like Trolls and Trolls 2, a small group (mainly young men, I assume) found them really hilarious.

I hadnt realized what a successful career Campbell made for himself.  He was in at least 68 movies (including some you would actually recognize, like Fargo, Congo, Escape from L.A., McHales Navy, Spider Man I, II and III, The Love Bug, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Cars II, Burn Notice (the movie) as well as numerous TV series (including Burn Notice), and he has also directed, written and produced.  Wow!  Hes also younger than I realized (born 1958 in Michigan, of Scotch background).  Even stranger, for someone whose career is heavy on low budget horror films, hes also an ordained minister who has performed marriagesAnyhow his earlier films in particular were all obscure horror films like Attack of the Helping Hand or Maniac Cop and many others

Physically he seems to be a large man, whose most prominent feature is a concave-looking face with a very prominent chin (lets call it the Jay Leno look).

As well as ambition, he must have a good sense of humor: for example he did his own biographical movie, My Name is Bruce and two books: If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor and Make Love!  The Bruce Campbell Way  (Yes, really!)

Well, apart from two of the Evil Dead films which I regret having watched, this is the only other film Ive seen with Campbell in a lead role, and perhaps it will be my last.  It was also the best of the three.

This first came out in 1989, some 8 years after The Evil Dead.  The dust jacket sounded like it would be just as terrible as The Evil Dead: Bruce Campbell and Walter Koenig (aka Chekov in the Star Trek series) are two astronauts on a moon mission who find that the moon is under the control of alien cyborgs who want to invade Earth.  Along the way they reanimate the body of a woman (Leigh Lombardi) who had been put in some state of suspension by the aliens 14,000 years ago.  My first reaction on reading this was: ""let me guesswhen shes reanimated, no doubt shes nude, except for some sheet covering her lower body""

Well the dust jacket for the new Blu-Ray release hastens to point out that this film has the distinction of being one of the most influential indie horror films of its decade [along with The Evil Dead, I presume].  Bracing myself and keeping an eye on the eject button, I hit play.

Sadly, especially considering this is a Blu-Ray re-release, there is no sub-titling.  The sound track also remains monaural like the original, but it was remastered to high definition video in 2014, just for this release.

I was wrong about the re-animation being in the nude.  The first female nudity in the film is an exotic dancer, at a club somewhere near the Cape Canaveral NASA base, prior to their take-off.  Though yes, one does later have the opportunity to see Leigh Lombardi bare her breasts (perhaps her finest acting in the film) but this was not when the audience first meets her.

Although Campbells acting was still fairly terrible, it was not nearly as terrible as in The Evil Dead.  It had graduated from F to something like C-.  Chekov didn't do much better either.  Which proves,  I suppose, that if you do something long enough, eventually you're bound to get somewhat better at it no matter how bad you were at the start.

For a low-budget indie horror movie, the visuals were for the most part surprisingly good and probably constitute the strongest part of this movie.  Im excluding the cyborgs from that statement, and thinking mostly about the views of space craft, moon rovers, walking on the moon with the Earth in the sky, etc.  All in all, this was actually a vast improvement on films like The Evil Dead.  It's also more straightforward B-movie science fiction, without any supernatural-horror element involved.  If you like easily-digestible sci-fi entertainment, this Blu-ray re-do should be your cup of tea.",1421020800,,4308,4.638522427440633

530748,3,6302999588,"Moontrap(released June/89)stars,among others, Walter Koenig,Bruce Campbell and Leigh Lombardi. The film is a well acted film,that moves along well until about 3/4 the way through, then starts bogging down.
The story finds Koenig and Campbell orbiting the earth in a shuttle. They encounter a huge alien craft in their orbit and Koenig does a space walk to investigate. He enters a a large hole in the side and retrieves a football shaped object,and also a humanoid corpse which happens to float by at the same time. They bring back both to earth for study. Back on terra firma they discover the origin of the objects, which was from the Prometheus crater on the moon. Campbell and Koenig convince a visiting government dignitary that they(Koenig and Campbell)must return to the crater to see what is there. However during their discussions the football shaped object retrieved turns out to have active alien technology inside. It takes parts from everything around itself to create a walking mechanical creature,which starts running amok. After a lengthy battle in a corridor Koenig is the one who finally manages to bring the thing down.
A short time later the two astronauts have blasted off and are now on the moon. They have also recruited a fellow astronaut who has their backs orbiting the moon above them,and whom they are in constant contact with. The two on the surface head off to the crater and indeed find an alien base of some sorts. Before they can investigate inside,they are accosted by a mechanical alien which they dispatch with the machine guns they have brought. Inside they find a room in which is littered with skeletons. In the  middle is a round shaped object which they open up,only to find a live female human-looking alien,who speaks no English. They take the female with them,who has her own suit stored in a cubbyhole of the round object she came out of. They head back to their lander. However a larger version of the mechanized alien  that accosted them earlier has literally taken their ship and put it on a larger alien ship, which is pointed for launch at earth. When they reach the lander site they find,of course,their ship is gone. They hop back on their rover and follow the tracks in the ground as far as they can until the rover's batteries run out. Then it is walking time. They not only discover the large alien ship but two more mechanical aliens accost them. This time,even though they are able to destroy both,Campbell is severely injured and soon dies.
Koenig and the alien female walk back to the dead rover. They are just in time to see their friend in the orbiting spacecraft come plunging into the lunar surface after being attacked. Koenig inflates a portable air-filled hut and both of them spend a time there....enough to make love. Just as they are about to leave another alien comes after them,and this one is made up of some of dead Campbell's parts! Koenig dispatches it. Soon however two more aliens show up and both Koenig and the female are captured and taken aboard the alien ship,which blasts off for earth. On the way the two are manacled and they find they are to be used  merely as spare parts. Before an alien can chop up the female,Koenig breaks loose and takes out the alien. The two then escape to a larger,more open area of the ship(with zero gravity) where they not only find their lunar lander,but thousands of those football shaped objects from earlier. Koenig sets the lander to self destruct. Just before the explosion Koenig's use of his fire arm against an alien propels him back into the ship. This gives him the idea to do it again but this time to propel them both clear and  out of the ship. As the ship explodes the two float towards another shuttle craft which was sent up to destroy the alien ship,but never could.
Fast forward back on earth,Koenig is now married to the alien who now speaks passable English. She re-iterates her love for him. The closing shot of the film is in a junk yard and one of those football shaped objects is opening up again,surrounded by a lot of items with which to animate itself with.
The film moves along very well for the most part and all involved do a good job in their respective parts. This movie was definitely of the low budget variety and the S/FX were all for the most part done in camera,with a sprinkling of miniatures. I just recently reviewed a film of Jean Claude Van Damme's called ""Derailed"",and Moontrap's S/Fx out do that movie which was filmed about 13 years later! The production crew did a great job with what little funds they had. What I found kind of sunk the film a bit was at about the last 1/4 of the film. This would be around the time Koenig is making love to the female alien...who didn't see that one coming? From here on the plot becomes been there,done that...even for 1989. It seemed the producers were trying to think of a good way to end it,and were stumbling around with this old idea and that,which never totally satisfies..
Also,being the low budget film it is,you will see bloopers. One big one is the part where Koenig and Campbell have to abandon their rover and climb a steep crater hill to find the alien base. Next thing you know the two are pulling up in their rover in front of the alien base in the crater! Huh? There are others but I won't spoil your fun looking for them.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1. Extras include director commentary and two nice recent interviews with Campbell and Koenig(21 and 33 minutes respectively).
All in all a  nice re-release of a long forgotten Sci-Fi film of the 80s, starring every one's favourite ensign from Star Trek(TOS),and the best B-movie actor of his generation. It shows its low budget finery but does good things with what little it has,which puts many later,more high budget movies to shame. The plot/editing is quick and fast up until the last quarter,where it starts to lose its traction. It's not a classic by any stretch,but it is far from a stinker. 3-3 1/2 stars.",1419724800,,6031,4.632710280373832

 Okay so this movie never made it to dvd I get that, but it's still worth a look by any si-fi or Bruce Campbell fan. Moontrap stars Walter Koenig from the original Star Trek series and Bruce Campbell who kicks demon butt in all the Evil Dead movies. If you can get use to the idea that Bruce is the sidekick to little Walter in this flick, you may enjoy it more. Remember, this was made in the 80's before computer graphics so some of the effects may not amaze you.
 It starts off with Bruce and Walter investigating a huge alien ship from the moon passing earth and they bring back a football type artifact that builds itself into a killer robot using anything handy. So of course our two heros have to go to the moon and investigate. Guess what, give up? They find a girl, a darn good looking girl in a palace on the lunar surface that helps them stop an alien invasion plot to conquer earth, maybe.
  I paid about $12 bucks for this movie and I think I got a pretty good deal. Please be kind to animals. Remember Karma, she knows things.",1342742400,8,1184,4.784313725490196

On the positive side, Bruce Campbell certainly does the best with what he's given in a large, but supporting, role. The special effects are overall really good, especially considering the budget. Some of the moon walking scenes are less successful, but the miniature and model effects are certainly better than I expected.

Now the downside. Walter Koenig. Yes, he played Chekov on ""Star Trek"", which gives him a certain amount of nerd-cred. Who knew that would be is best acting though? He is just awful in this movie. So bad, in fact, he drags everything else down with him. He even gets a love scene that comes off as so awkward and gratuitous, it feels like  Koenig's contract for making this movie must have included an ""I get to touch some boobs"" clause.

As much as I've said the special effects and model work were far above what a low budget movie should have, I wish I could say the same for the aliens. The aliens in this movie are just plain bad.

Overall, ""Moontrap"" is AT BEST a mixed effort. If, like me, you bought it because of Bruce Campbell, you'll enjoy his scenes pretty well. Unfortunately, he's not the star and Walter Koenig, who is the star, is painful to watch.",1504915200,,1364,4.528455284552845
