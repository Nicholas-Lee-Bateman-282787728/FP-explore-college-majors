8030376,5,B0002PYS2Y,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE...THANKS !!!.....DR M RAJ SINGH,1420416000,,66,5.090909090909091
8030377,5,B0002PYS2Y,"This small video lesson has a lot of information packed into it

the warm ups are simple yet they cover how to open up the voice and avoid singing nasally

the demonstration of pitch is the best way for a novice to understand pitch and to teach them how to adjust

the interval training is EASY and it gives you a great way to always remember intervals",1390003200,3,352,4.223880597014926
8030378,1,B0002PYS2Y,"Would love my money back.  This seems like it was made at home, not in a studio.  I really did not learn anything.  Total joke!",1379462400,,127,4.0
8030379,2,B0002PYS2Y,"Very nice vocal instructional DVD (which I needed), but the instruction ended too soon.  It did not include instruction on how to control the diaphram; breathing; note transition (cracking); etc.  This limited instructional DVD should have been priced much lower than it actually is, so that the buyer could purchace further instruction (I still can not sing with confidence - my voice still cracks).  I paid too much for this lesson.",1320710400,,434,5.084507042253521
8030380,5,B0002PYS2Y,"This DVD is for a total beginner. An advanced person would not be satisfied. Since I am not in that category, I was satisfied.",1256860800,5,126,4.291666666666667
8030381,4,B0002PYS2Y,"I fully support the other reveiewer's comments that this DVD is for beginners, but I think that Homespun made that very clear.

If you are a rank beginner, meaning someone who has had no formal training, this DVD is a great place to start.

I have never had any vocal training, love to sing, and wanted to improve and this DVD helped me understand the basics of vocal training, and, like any other stringed instrument, my voice has improved.  I am better at holding notes and hitting proper keys.

This is a short and valuable DVD; one to be used repeatedly, until you are ready to move on to the next phase (Penny Nichols has a 6 CD set out).

If you have never had voice lessons and want to learn to improve your singing, at whatever level you may be at, you will find this DVD to have clarity, ease of use, and helpful.

My only wish is that it was longer than 60 minutes.  90 minutes would have meant 5 *****.",1229644800,13,913,4.242774566473988
8030382,2,B0002PYS2Y,"I stopped singer 5 years ago and picked up smoking.  So of course when I wanted to go back to singing, I thought it might help to get a vocal training DvD.  I wanted to start back at the basics,  warm-ups, practice songs, phrasing and the like.  This was NOT what I was looking for.  When it says beginners, it means BEGINNERS! Like you have no clue what sounds coming out of your mouth is about. From start to finish I was disappointed. The lessons are very slow, corny and extremely boring! The only thing I can say good about it is that there are some technical things pointed out in this DvD that maybe not everyone already knows. Things like stretching the whole body and learning to relax the jaw and other techniques of that nature. Yes, all of this means I regret the money I spent.",1172966400,4,790,4.3108108108108105
