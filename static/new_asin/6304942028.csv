7880463,4,6304942028,"I watched this movie when it was first on tv and later taped off the tv.  I loved the schmaltzy-ness of it and was overjoyed to find that I could buy a good copy.  My younger brother used to watch it over and over too even years later.  It is a funny, silly movie just right for when you want some fluff to watch.  I recommend it!",974505600,13,330,3.8805970149253732
