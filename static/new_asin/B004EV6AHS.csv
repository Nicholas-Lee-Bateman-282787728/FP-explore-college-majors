4367964,5,B004EV6AHS,"A lot of people have been complaining for quite a while about the lack of new original movies. All of those people need to check out All About Evil ASAP. It is a new horror movie, and it is one of a kind and 100% original. It is also very clever, funny, bloody, and well-acted. It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last year. And just look at that cast! Natasha Lyonne stars and gives an unhinged performance that would be nominated for an Oscar, if the Oscars didn't suck. Then there's old pros Mink Stole and Cassandra Peterson (aka Elvira), who both actually have a decent amount of screen time. Noah Segan is hilarious as a psychotic bum. And Thomas Dekker gives a good performance as our hero. And he is so cute and definitely marriage material! See All About Evil! It is a brilliant independent horror film that is totally evil...in a very good way!!",1297728000,6,864,4.40625
4367965,5,B004EV6AHS,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie in a soldout theater during its cross country tour. It was a very mixed audience with younger and older people.  Everyone loved it! It had people laughing at some scenes and gasping during others.  The acting is truly wonderful, Natasha Lyonne in particular is superb. Her transformation is brilliant. There really is not a weak link in the cast. I have never been much of a fan of the horror genre, but this film transcends that label and tells a good story in a dark and funny way.  I could hardly wait for the video and have loved watching all the extras.  It will be fun to see what Mr. Grannell comes up with for his next project.",1296518400,4,676,4.341269841269841
4367966,5,B004EV6AHS,"Lately I have been surprised by how good some B horror flicks I have seen (Death Factory comes to mind). But All About Evil blows them away- is just fantastic! The story is so unique, the acting is actually really terrific, and it has an artistic overall feel. There is nothing too predictable, and not much that makes you go ""OMG Don't go in there! Gah why do they do this in these movies, you know noone would in real life!"" (that can get irritating, like in Friday the 13th flicks and such).  We watched ALL of the extras and those were just as fun to watch. Peaches Christ is one heck of a visionary, and we really look forward to his next film. Next time around, if we are so lucky to have a premier showing in our neck of the woods again (there was one in Baltimore that we regret missing) we will definitely not miss it. Too much artistic talent and fun from Peaches and his crew. LOVED IT!!!",1292025600,10,899,4.226744186046512
4367967,5,B004EV6AHS,"This movie made me excited to watch horror movies again. I had heard about this movie for a while and decided to ask for it for Christmas. This was the greatest Christmas present EVER!! The cast that was assembled for this film was amazing, the storyline always keeps you interested, and I loved all of the different references so subtly thrown into the film. Peaches Christ deserves a great amount of credit for this film! I will keep my eyes open for the future of his film making, and I advise all of you to as well!!",1356480000,,520,4.371134020618556
4367968,5,B004EV6AHS,"It is obvious that Peaches Christ loves B movies. All About Evil oozes with low-budget film history, pulling stylistic cues from the greats (Waters, Corman, etc) while never seeming stale or getting caught up in cliches. She makes it all seem fresh again. Easily one of the best of the decade.",1354060800,,293,4.764705882352941
4367969,5,B004EV6AHS,"I watched this at the World Premier, and I absolutely loved it! Peaches Christ delivers! Plus Natasha Lyonne and Thomas Dekker are awesome in it! I was waiting to buy it to see if it would ever come out on Bluray, but it never did, so I finally bought it on DVD and I do not regret it at all. I watched it with a friend, and we were both rolling in laughter so much, at one point we actually had to keep rewinding a particularly funny scene and we watched it about 10 times laughing non-stop the entire time. We could barely breath we were laughing so hard!

I also love that they included a mini documentary that had clips from the World Premier. When my friend and I watched it, I enjoyed being able to show him what the premier was like when I was there.

All in all, if you like horror films and you like camp, you have to purchase or at least see this movie. (Note: There is some nudity in it, but it's very brief, and it greatly adds to the scene.)",1353196800,,954,4.069148936170213
4367970,5,B004EV6AHS,LOVE IT!!!! WHY I THINK IT GOOD BECASUE IT GOURY AND ACTION HAS GOOD ACT IN IT WHEN I WHARTH IT I'M SO SCEAD,1348876800,,108,3.5416666666666665
4367971,5,B004EV6AHS,"This is not a ""real"" review, as I haven't seen the film but have been trying to since its release, but it's unavailable, except for this overpriced DVD (thirty dollars?!  It's not even blu ray).  I don't have Chiller TV as part of my cable package, but would even be willing to pay for it on On Demand, if it were possible. It would be great if this film could be made more accessible rather than having to pay a price for the DVD like this.",1341100800,,441,4.116279069767442
4367972,5,B004EV6AHS,"First off, I won't ramble on about the synopsis of this movie as you are here by one of three sources, Amazon recommended it, you saw a trailer for it on YouTube, or you heard about it by word of mouth. I have been following this movie since IMDB said that Cassandra Peterson (Elvria) was going to be in it and have been dying to see it since. If you want a synopsis just scroll up on this screen, the info that Amazon provided is right on the nail.

While watching this modern cult masterpiece I felt completely astonished and ecstatic to know that someone still understood what it took to make a great camp black comedy.  To this I have to say the writer/director, Joshua Grannell AKA Peaches Christ is an amazing talent that proves his/her brilliance by not only screenwriting and acting but directing.

From start to finish I loved this movie, it had the right amount of camp, comedy and horror to fill the complete feature.  My only complaint was I hated for the movie to end! In all of my years of being a movie buff, age 5 to current age 27, this has got to be the best contemporary horror comedy in ages.  The last time I remember being so blown away by a movie was when I saw Pink Flamingos for the first time, which was 10 years back.  While I am praising Peaches Christ I have to note that his/her style, is a nice mixture of classic John Waters, Herschell Gordon, Lewis, William Castle, etc.

Peaches, the horror gay community needs you.  There are tons of gay/lesbian/bi/transgendered people out there who love horror and camp.  Until you graced us with your full length feature masterpiece we only had John Waters and few other names to cling to.  I honestly believe you can do for my generation and the upcoming generation what the ""Dreamlanders"" did for so many cult followers in the 70's.

Finally, I would like to note that for some reason, Amazon doesn't have a stock of this movie. I'm not sure why but the individual seller that provides the movie through Amazon is actually the real Peaches Christ.  I am noting this because I know some people are hesitant in purchasing from an individual seller, however, I purchased my copy through Peaches via Amazon and was happy to note that the seller acted with speedy and prompt service.  When I received the DVD, it was factory sealed and in perfect condition, so don't be afraid to order from the seller on this page.

Keep up the good battle Peaches! You have gained a hardcore fan in Mississippi! Thank you for entertaining the world with this movie filled with not only great laughs and gore but a great cast of amazing actors and actresses.",1334275200,,2610,4.502118644067797
4367973,5,B004EV6AHS,"This movie rocks!!! Fun and horrorific;) I love dark bloody humor and this film is packed with it. Lots of blood for my semi-sadistic mind to enjoy, and it never gets boring. No random, stupid love making scenes, no dumb crap that has nothing to do with the film, and of course, no trying to take itself to serious. It's obviously a b-movie, but this the BEST b-movie, and I am a fan of a lot of b-movies (particularly horror). And, of course, as a horror/dark humor fan, this film didn't opress me for one moment. This...movie...is...AWSOME!!! ...And killer;)",1320192000,3,560,4.666666666666667
4367974,5,B004EV6AHS,"All of us have something we're passionate about, so passionate that we'll do almost anything for it. But what if that something was going to be taken away from you? What would you do to keep it? Would you go so far as to kill? That is what librarian, Deborah Tennis (Natasha Lyonne), is up against when her mother wants to close down the theater she just inherited from her recently passed father.

4367975,5,B004EV6AHS,"Best B movie of 2010! Campy gore-fest at its best. The acting was a bit better than your usual B flick, the senseless killing was perfect and humorous. Seeing Natasha Lyonne and Cassandra Peterson after such a long time was thrilling. Peaches Christ was hilarious and is now one of my new favorite drag queens. I've watched this movie repeatedly with friends and they just love it love it love it. I hope they make more movies with the same cast or even a sequel to this one.",1300320000,10,475,4.409090909090909
4367976,5,B004EV6AHS,"But you have to be into this sort of thing.  It's not Stephen Spielberg; it's not touchy-feely; it's not subtle; and it's not dark and mysterious.

What it is, though, is a wild, tongue-in-cheek, faaaaabulous homage to those really, really bad slasher movies that somehow get financing and a distribution deal.  The whole thing plays like an inside joke, only you're in on it.  If the movie strikes you at first as awful, realize that the awfulness is on purpose.  If it seems way over the top and, frankly, totally unbelievable, even for a horror movie, keep in mind that the movie-makers intended it to be that way.

I knew absolutely nothing about this movie or the people who made it, but I learned that the woman who plays the ""Elvira"" character was in it.  Cassandra Peterson has starred in a couple of spoofy comedy movies as ""Elvira"" and I enjoyed their campy-ness, as well as Ms. Peterson's adorable, stand-out personality and talent as a comedic actress.

In this movie, Ms. Peterson plays a concerned mother of a teenage boy.  The ""Elvira"" costume, wig, and makeup are gone.  She plays the role straight--i.e., no buffoonery or hamming it up.  And even though she isn't using comedy to ""act,"" her skills as a dramatic actress shine and are just as fascinating to watch.  She isn't given a lot of screen time, but that's okay because her brief appearance lends a spark of credibility to the motion picture.

It's also deliciously ironic that Ms. Peterson does not appear in ""drag"" as Elvira because there is so much drag in the rest of the movie.  The man who directed the film also stars in it as a female -- a big, overly exaggerated version of a female, to be precise.  And there are plenty of other eye-popping, alternative characters to prompt the casual viewer to wonder, ""What the heck am I looking at?""  Yet, despite how some of these aspects in other movies might turn off some viewers, this film manages to stay just this side of the line of not too bizarre for mainstream audiences.

The EXTRAS on the DVD explain everything -- who the director is, how he brought the film to fruition, and how he (Joshua Grannell) as a she (Peaches Christ) obtained such a huge cult following by appearing in movie theaters to host showings of really, really bad horror films.

The quality of the DVD audio and video is excellent.  Presented in 1.78 widescreen.  Color/Stereo. 98 mins.",1299283200,7,2390,4.658711217183771
8427647,5,B004EV6AHS,"When I first watched ""All About Evil"" it was on the DVR at my cousins house, I was hooked. It's got all the elements of a campy horror flick with a John Waters film, and even becomes something more. It's an unequivocal balance of horror, dark humor and camp atmosphere. Director Josh Granell appears as his alter ego ""Peaches Christ"" alongside Natasha Lyonne, Cassandra Peterson (Elvira!) and even a John Waters staple, Mink Stole.

The story concerns a mousy librarian with an axe to grind, when her evil step mother threatens the future of her inherited movie theater. Unknowingly have her crime filmed by security camera, she screens the murder as an accidental short film, bringing business back to the Victoria. But the show must go on, and Deborah has a few more vic- I mean, movies to cut!

The movie is quite an enjoyable roller coaster ride, with some truly genuine moments of hilarity counterbalanced by some awesome gore. The performances were top notch and a few moments with Peaches are played for humor will get a hardy chuckle, there literally isn't a dull moment in this film. I highly recommend this future cult classic!",1467676800,,1137,4.795918367346939

8427656,4,B004EV6AHS,"A soon to be cult classic b-movie....although I don't know that I should call it a b-movie only because it's nicely done. All About Evil is with out all the flash and dash some horror flicks rely on these days, just to capture the audiences' attention. Instead this film is simplistic in it's approach and presents a nice twist. I had fun with this one and I've added it to my 31 Days of Horror movie marathon for October.",1364083200,,422,4.3544303797468356
