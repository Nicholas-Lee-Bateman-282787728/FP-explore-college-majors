8420015,4,B004AC6PU8,"Not the first time I got a dual movie Blu-Ray/DVD set. I was interested in collecting only one movie and that was Butterfly Effect 3, and this set is the only way to get the movie on Blu-Ray. Broken isn't that bad of a movie if anyone is interested.

Broken is an interesting albeit really slow and modest in the suspense department. This whole twisted doppelganger thing has been done before but never this slow. Not my kind of time waster.

Butterfly Effect 3 is great. Having watched the original with Ashton Kutcher, I was more or less disappointed in the acting and the storytelling was really bad in Kutcher's attempt in a Sci-Fi/Drama. But in the realm of time-travelling/alternate reality movies, it wasn't half bad. Meant to be a career booster for Kutcher, it was a tragic miss. But this story was fun and given the direct to DVD sequel in name only twice. Don't know the second movie but I had seen the third and I really enjoyed it. A man is born with the ability to travel back in time and change destiny, but he's smart enough to know maybe from the first or second movie the dangers of changing history, but uses his gifts to bring justice via solving murders for the police by traveling back in time to witness said events. It feels like the pilot for a TV show than a simple movie but its good. Starring Chris Carmack from 'The OC', who by the way is insanely more talented than Kutcher, uses his gift to help others but a development in a personal case has brought him to the brink of should he or shouldn't he. He attempts to be impartial as he does his best to change the future with as little harm as possible. But things happen, quite possibly not his fault but by means of someone else in sabotaging his attempts.

Butterfly Effect 3 has a much better story than the first movie and much smarter character and actor. I wouldn't mind if they made this a TV show based on this concept. A very good movie.",1518739200,,1925,4.38655462184874
