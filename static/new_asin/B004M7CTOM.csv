4428701,2,B004M7CTOM,"It's hard to tell just what the point if any this movie was trying to make. There are scenes which contain cheap disjointed porn and then moral comments

This ""film"" really was a waste of money and at best should be rented and not bought",1176076800,6,237,4.266666666666667
4428702,2,B004M7CTOM,"This was rather disappointing. The film is touted as a modern day re-telling of the classic twin novels ""Justine"" and ""Juliette"" by the Marquis de Sade. The novels are classics of S&M literature as well as socio-philosophical treatises in their own right. Sadly all the sadomasochistic content has been stripped out from this film version. What we are left with is the basic story outline; two orphan girls left alone in a cruel world to fend for themselves. The philosophical underpinning, that this world rewards vice and punishes virtue has also been cast aside to accomodate the more socially acceptable conclusion - virtue will be rewarded. The scene has been updated to 1970s Sweden. Sweet, innocent Justine is played by Swedish teen hottie Marie Fors and Juliette is played by Anne Bie Warburg. And they are the main reasons to watch this film.

The film serves mainly as an excuse for these delectable hotties to get naked and naughty. There is a lot of nudity and hardcore sex. Harry Reems (Deepthroat) is not here for nothing. This is triple-X material which I didn't expect to see on Amazon but I'm not complaining. Marie Fors appears under the name Maria Lynn. She is adorable but not at her most winsome here. As Justine the prude, she sulks too much and is unhappy most of the time. When she finally does smile, the screen literally lights up. To see her at her finest, watch her in Joseph Sarno's ""Girl on Girl"" trilogy (softcore).

The film itself is played out as a sex comedy. Harry Reems is Don Miller, an American millionaire who has willed that whichever prostitute he dies in the saddle with, will inherit his entire fortune. Juliette (Warburg) works in the brothel where he cavorts and she, like all the other girls, try their darndest to get him to croak in the sack. Of course, it is finally up to the sweetly innocent Justine (Fors) to do the trick. Shoring up this pretty lame plot are generous helpings of wholly gratuitous sex - 70s vintage with bushes galore and as many blowjobs, cumshots and penetration-shots as in any standard porno flick. The angelic Marie Fors of course, as per her contract, is never shown in anything explicit. Still, she is the reason to watch this and she doesn't disappoint.

The film transfer from Impulse Pictures is disappointing. It is presented in its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio, pillarboxed into a 16:9 anamorphic frame (enhanced for widescreen TV). However, little to no restoration has been done. The print looks old. Nicks, specks and scratches abound. The picture is grainy and soft. The colour is faded and dull. Black level is set to a dull grey. Colour-timing is wholly inconsistent. Flesh tones vary from shot to shot, ranging from pallid white, to pink, to purplish, to orange. Some scenes have a cold bluish cast. Others have a warm yellow-orange look. It may not trouble the average porn viewer but it will drive cinephiles up the wall. I will not be buying anything from Impulse Pictures again. This film needs a proper restoration under the likes of Blue Underground or Severin. It is presented with its original Swedish mono track. Optional English subtitles are provided. There are absolutely no Extras. Not really recommendable unless you're a dedicated fan of the lovely Miss Fors and even then, I'd gladly dump this version for a new remastering when it comes along.",1171584000,60,3350,4.822608695652174

8435584,3,B004M7CTOM,"Maria Forsa brings viewers to a sexual tour.  From a village orphan living with her aunt to a metro whorehouse visiting her friend.  Noticeably, she does not perform any hardcore actions.  Yes, this movie is a X rated version.

In the very beginning of this movie, a sex scene is created from the bible.  A night club live show style.  Shocking.
In the end, a very wealthy American dies in her arms after a multiple sexual play.  This way, she gets 50% of his net worth. Pure luck.",1493683200,,481,4.3977272727272725
8435585,5,B004M7CTOM,"Yes, very realistic and shows real life situations. In plain English its porno with sociology as main point. Plot primitive but we  see plenty of hot chicks and action and no restrictions of any kind. Cover art doesn't reflect properly this flick. Excellent.",1411430400,3,258,5.0
8435586,5,B004M7CTOM,"What a great movie to watch, good story, good acting, and actualy you can watch few times, because it was made like any normal movie with different locations, many actors, and it was mixed with porn, sexuality, and nudity. The acting is great, the sex was not acting, but was real, and the ladies were beautiful. I gave five stars because it deserved it.",1346716800,14,354,4.546875
8435587,3,B004M7CTOM,This is not the uncut widescreen version. It is fullscreen & warburg's hardcore scenes were cut out. It does have a lot of hardcore scenes. I did like this movie.  I did not like that there are a few women with hairy legs which there are in foreign films but most of the women in this one do not. One very hairy & closeup which was a very bad turnoff. The plot is fair. The transfer is fair but not the best.,1313193600,12,408,3.975609756097561
8435588,5,B004M7CTOM,"This movie about two sisters, Justine and Juliette, is based loosely on the Marquis De Sade.  Not for the children, or anyone who is offended by nudity and erotic stories.  Not bad, covers similar ground as movies by Jess (Jesus) Franco.",1282608000,,237,4.7560975609756095

8435590,2,B004M7CTOM,"I watched this movie with my girlfriend and although it has tons of XXX explicit sex scenes it didn't turn us really on (maybe the fact that it is in swedish with english subtitles didn't help either), the sex scenes are overacted and simply exagerated (not believable) and non erotic...
Neither of us read the original book by the Marquis de Sade, but I'm sure that he would turn in his grave if he saw this movie!
The story isn't bad, the acting is (mostly), if you are looking for a cheap 70's porn movie with lots of pubic hair and overdue sex acting scenes this is the movie for you!",1215734400,3,588,4.306306306306307
8435591,4,B004M7CTOM,"What can I say but... grindhouse?!

This is a move that you take with a grain of salt. It's humorous, it's juvenille, and it's oh so entertaining!

My favorite part has to be the orgy going on on-stage at a club where they're retelling the biblical story of Lot and his wife. Shocking - but great!",1205884800,,297,4.285714285714286
8435592,4,B004M7CTOM,"First off the quality of this was good & bad. Bright shots & faded parts. However all in all..for this feature..it was pretty good. Widescreen helped to make it...more to see. However the only thing that saved it was the beauitful..Marie Forsa. In the credits she goes by Marie Lynn. She made ""Girl meets Girl"".Her best was...""BUTTERFLIES"".Granted she's over 30 years older now..but in her day she makes Paris Hilton a rag doll. Ms. Forsa...your still a beauitful woman. For you Marie Forsa fans out there..I would say purchase it. She's worth the watch!",1185062400,12,554,4.904255319148936
