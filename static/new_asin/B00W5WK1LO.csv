7120359,1,B00W5WK1LO,Paint by numbers plot that's rushed and portrayed by actors with zero chemistry.,1429833600,,80,5.230769230769231
7120360,4,B00W5WK1LO,"Adult Beginners, the directorial debut by producer Ross Katz, features an incredible cast of funny people from top to bottom. Nick Kroll, Rose Byrne, and Bobby Cannavale sit at the top of the list, but the supporting roles are filled by the likes of Joel McHale, Bobby Moynihan, Mike Birbiglia, Jane Krakowski, and Jason Mantzoukas. So this is undoubtedly a comedy from Katz, who is best known for producing emotional relationship dramas like Lost in Translation and In the Bedroom. Maybe it's that experience looking at complicated human feelings with subtlety that separates Adult Beginners from every other indie dramedy about starting over.

Kroll, who came up with the story himself, is known for his caustic wit and sniveling persona seen on The Kroll Show and in The League. He brings much of that same personality here, but leaves enough room for a bit of humanity to slip through the cracks. He plays Jake, a potential entrepreneur with techy invention known as the Mind's I. He's poured every penny into this Google Glass rip-off, along with all of his friends' money, but when the manufacturer can't produce a key part he's screwed. Having lost everything, including his gold-digger of a girlfriend (who was JUST making out with him), Jake retreats to his childhood home where his pregnant sister Justine (Byrne) lives with her husband Danny Cannavale) and young son, Teddy.

We've all been through really tough times and for many of us, certainly for me, home is where I want to go to forget about it. So we understand Jake's need for the creature comforts the place he grew up can provide. However things aren't quite that simple. Jake needs to earn his keep, and that means becoming Teddy's nanny, a job he's wildly unsuited for. Justine and Danny have their own problems, too, whether it is money, work pressures, and the threat of infidelity.

Many of these things may sound familiar, in particular the bond that comes to form between Jake and Teddy, but don't go in thinking for a second this is some artificial nonsense like St. Vincent.  We understand the depths of his self-loathing, and the simple pleasure he takes from eating frozen yogurt, smoking pot, and doing all the things he did when happy. It's a way of figuring out who one truly wants to be. By the same token, Danny and Justine's relationship has real texture, not just a series of sitcom parental issues. She's been so distracted by work and motherhood that her husband has become lost in the mix, which has driven him to do things he would later come to regret. But the film's real joy, and this is a credit to screenwriters Jeff Cox and Liz Flahive, is how these characters come to rely on one another and grow from their experience. When Jake first arrives he's been estranged from the family for months, but as Justine reconnects with him the old childhood rhythms begin to emerge. The cozy look at sibling relationships will remind many of last year's The Skeleton Twins, which like this was produced by the Duplass Brothers. They've got the market cornered on smart, funny Indies about messed-up family dynamics.

Adult Beginners' insights are a bit slight, and the ending is way too gooey, but there's nothing wrong with a film that unabashedly says being a childish grown-up is perfectly okay sometimes.",1429833600,,3296,4.826548672566371
7120361,5,B00W5WK1LO,"I enjoy the actor's dry sense of humor and it comes out on this show.

Short version: the guy is screwed over (first 5 minutes of the movie, not a big plot point) when his manufacturer doesn't come through on a part for his product. He ends up losing all of his (and some of other people's) money, so it's a bit of a disaster for him. He goes to his sister for a place to crash and get back in order. Basically what it shows in the trailer, don't want to give away too much.

I'd recommend the movie if you like dry humor (lots of cursing too). It doesn't have a ton of scenes that will make you burst into laughter, it's more like chuckle laughter. I like that type of humor, but it's not for everyone. The actors all do a good job, in my opinion. If you like the trailer you'll probably like the movie. It's more of a ""story movie"" than a ""make you laugh"" movie.

I should mention though, it's a dramedy so it's not all funny. I think that's what makes the dry humor effective. So I wouldn't go into it looking for only laughs. It's a good movie though.",1429833600,11,1055,4.086956521739131

7120373,5,B00W5WK1LO,I find Nick Kroll to be hilarious. Kroll Show was one of the funniest sketch shows ever written.

7120378,3,B00W5WK1LO,"The premise seems to be like this: ""Let's make a romantic movie with a male and female lead, but then let's remove the romance and make the leads brother and sister.""  So they have lots of moments, and you get to see their relationship go through some ups & downs.  There is even the typical ""lost the girl"" moment, where he screws it up with his sister and then has to work to regain her trust.  You know, you've seen this movie, it's just different because it's siblings instead of lovers.

Having said that, I have to admit that while I kind of hated the two of them for the first 20 minutes, they very quickly grew on me, and I found myself not only enjoying some of their antics, but also believing them, and being reminded of my own siblings.  I found it to be heartwarming and sweet, but not saccharine, not girly.  It's just a decent story about real human moments.  It didn't blow me away, but I felt it was worth my endorsement.",1444003200,,938,4.295454545454546

7120393,3,B00W5WK1LO,"Adult Beginners is a pleasant, if not particularly distinguished, comedy. Thirty something Jake (Nick Kroll) crashes and burns on the eve of his companys big launch. Broke and having alienated all his investor friends, Jake moves back home to live in his childhood house, which he shares with estranged sister Justine (Rose Byrne) and her family. To support himself, he takes the job of nanny to his 3-year-old nephew. Bobby Cannavale plays Justines husband, Danny, and Jane Krakowski (30 Rock) is a stand-out as singing swim instructor Miss Jenn.

Returning to his roots gives Jake the chance to start all over. Despite initial mistakes caring for a toddler, he soon bonds with his nephew. But all of the adult characters have axes to grind, unfinished business, thwarted ambitions, or are unhappy with their lives. Director Ross Katz avoids the temptation of going the sitcom route, building the movie around punchlines. he balances drama and comedy, weaving them together seamlessly so that the interactions seem believable and the dialogue real. These are not perfect characters, but thats what makes them interesting; they all have their flaws and thus resonate as genuine.

The metaphor of swimming runs through the movie. The ability to swim is not something were born with; it has to be learned. It cannot be learned as an outsider, observing. It must be learned by getting wet, practicing, and putting forth effort. Thus, swimming is like maturity. Just as there are adults who cannot swim, there are adults who have not completely embraced adulthood and its responsibilities and demands.

Both Mr. Kroll and Ms. Byrne are effective and have good screen chemistry. But the movie tends to use a familiar plot device: a person hits bottom and then must work his way up. Weve seen this story before, in slightly different forms. Director Katz never succeeds in raising the level of the picture from merely enjoyable to something more.

The only extra on the DVD release is a making-of featurette.",1438992000,,2002,5.039274924471299

7120395,4,B00W5WK1LO,"ADULT BEGINNERS is a pleasant, touching comedy-drama about an estranged family coming together again.

Nick Kroll plays a hip entrepreneur whose multi-million dollar company crashes and burns on the eve of its big launch.  Friendless and broke, he leaves Manhattan, journeying back to his hometown where his pregnant sister (Rose Byrne) and brother-in-law (Bobby Cannavale) take him in with the understanding that he act as nanny for their three-year-old son.  Now, for the first time in his life, Kroll is forced to accept some adult responsibilities and, if possible, grow up.

Directed by Ross Katz with a screenplay by Jeff Cox and Liz Flahive, ADULT BEGINNERS features some clever laugh-out-loud moments and is enhanced by a likable cast that includes Josh Charles, Bobby Moynihan, Jane Krakowski, Joel McHale and Mike Birbiglia.

The Blu-ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a Making of featurette.

All of who have personal struggles. The film handles these topics with a poignant thoughtfulness and the child helps ease those moments.

7120447,2,B00W5WK1LO,"I was expecting more from this movie due to the cast and for being a Duplass Brothers movie which are usually great but the story was so silly and predictable that I said to myself: ""I'm going to enjoy this no matter what, since the cast is amazing"" and I did enjoy but in the end it was such a waste of a great cast, but it was mildly entertaining and the Nick Kroll was great in it.",1430092800,,384,3.9358974358974357

7120451,5,B00W5WK1LO,"After thoroughly enjoying Adult Beginners, which I can easily say is one of the most hilarious and smart movies of the year, Im curious to know why I had never seen Nick Kroll in any prominent film roles before (or noticed him when I did). The name alone may not mean much to you, him being an actor that has only slowly emerged into film and television over the past decade, but hes certainly made his mark recently with his popular Comedy Central program Kroll Show. Bringing sketch comedy to the masses, hes already gained a huge cult following and is sure to grow more with this new film. However, its not exactly what you might expect. Its certainly very funny - with Kroll bringing the majority of the laughs - but its fair share of dramatic moments just may surprise fans of his signature over-the-top comedy.

He plays Jake, a self-absorbed entrepreneur who seems to have everything going for him until his much-talked about tech company loses its sole manufacturer the eve before its launch. With a huge amount of investor money dissipating overnight - as well as a great deal of his own - hes forced to leave Manhattan and seek support from his sister and brother-in-law at his childhood home (them being played by Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale). We see him try to get back on his feet and rediscover his family, all the while becoming a temporary nanny to his three year-old nephew.

The writing is extremely funny and the realism of it all is spot-on, not to mention the fantastic acting from each member of the cast. Byrne and Kroll are perfect together, feeling as if they're actual brother and sister, with some genuinely moving scenes that really blew me away. Its an unexpected pleasure of a movie that I couldn't recommend more, and will definitely be one of those that Ill be happily revisiting for a long time to come.",1430006400,5,1839,4.620795107033639
8712229,3,B00W5WK1LO,"A down-on-his-luck and broke brother (Nick Kroll) takes refuge at his older sister's (Rose Byrne) house after making some bad career choices, and overnight he becomes a nanny to his 3-year-old nephew.  Okay, that's roughly the plot of the much better ""You Can Count On Me"" (2000), but that's only a transient first chapter in this generally well-made film that showcases three family dynamics that I can relate to and love:  The brother-sister dynamic, the uncle-nephew dynamic (aka ""Unky Jake""), and the brother/brother-in-law (Bobby Cannavale) dynamic, yielding a nice change of cinematic pace, albeit somewhat lightweight and with some more-serious-than-expected marital themes.  I also wondered why the producers chose to include the F-bomb about every 5 minutes in a film in which much of the story revolves around a 3-year-old, but thankfully Kroll's and Byrne's sibship creates a common denominator with stamina that holds just steady enough, right through to the (probably) expected conclusion.  Small roles/cameos by Joel McHale and Jane Krakowski.",1532217600,,1057,5.506172839506172
