3099578,5,B0012YB9HG,"""What a Way to Go"" is a 123-minute ode to life as it could be, as it should be, as it has been in a distant past, and in some way, as it is now, as rejective of reality as that may be. We, who should be stewards of the earth, have instead tragically become its dominators, bending the rest of life to our will. But there remains the hope that within us are the seeds of wiser people and a better world.

I have seen a number of films on Peak Oil, climate change and the other ills of our society and planet (yes, even Nobel Laureate Al Gore's Oscar-winning ""An Inconvenient Truth""), but none has moved me so much as this one. While it does include some facts and figures, it primarily deals with the human psyche--the emotional and spiritual pain experienced by those living in, or victims of, industrially civilized countries. It builds a deep emotional and spiritual connection between the viewer and the planet on which we live, and the fellow creatures of all forms with whom we share life on this planet. It becomes clear that the suffering we experience as humans is shared by the entire biosphere. Because of the beliefs which have entrapped us, we are alienated not only from nature, but from each other and, indeed, from our true internal nature. What we have done to our planet we have also done to ourselves.

I have never seen a film quite like this before. The many brilliantly chosen film snippets--usually archival--are mesmerizing. Somehow using film clips from decades past creates a feeling of distance, connection and immediacy, all at the same time. I can't explain it, but I found their use extremely effective. Despite the often staccato use of the film clips, and the frequent interspersal of talking heads, the film flows smoothly, carrying us along in its grip as it goes. This is largely due to the narrator (writer/director Tim Bennett), whose words are interesting, compelling, and powerful, delivered with a soothing calmness and more than a touch of sad weariness, and because of the superb editing of the film, which according to the credits was done by Bennett and producer Sally Erickson. It is also a tribute to the film's very effective original music score.

""What a Way to Go"" is a two-hour poem of great power and beauty. It is the story of a personal journey, yet a journey that is also deeply universal. A journey that encompasses ignorance, awareness, fear, depression, denial, grief and despair. But when denial can no longer be maintained, and grief and despair can no longer be endured, there remain two options. Once is self-destruction; the other action. The narrator chooses action.

The topic of this film is human life, and our survival. ""What a Way to Go"" addresses many of the major threats to our life as a society which are, as we all know, coming together to form a ""perfect storm""--a nexus of catastrophe that could sweep many, if not all of us, into extinction. Peak Oil quickly becomes a simple hors d'oeuvre as the film moves on to climate change, mass extinction, population overshoot, famine, disease, toxins and other threats to civilization.

Interestingly, the film identifies agriculture as the point where trouble first began for the human race. Growing food instead of gathering food became humanity's first truly disruptive technology. The logical outcome of being able to--and needing to--stay in one place was cities, which by their very nature cannot be sustainable. They have no choice but to be dependent on resources from outside their area.

Agriculture appears to have been the point of division, the time when humans began to change their surroundings rather than simply live within them. It was the beginning of our separation from--or at least our perceived separation from--nature. More than 10,000 years later, it can best be expressed by the words of that wise observer of society and human nature, Woody Allen, who has said: ""I am at two with nature.""

I referred above to ""talking heads"". A better term would be ""talking hearts"" or even ""talking souls"". Although scientists are interviewed, the majority of the commentators in the film are writers, artists, academics and others who demonstrate clearly that our society should give equal time to the creative observers of our society. Some of the better known are Thomas Berry, Jerry Mander, Daniel Quinn, William Catton, Derrick Jensen, Chellis Glendinning, Richard Heinberg (in his role as a generalist and humanist as well as a Peak Oil expert), Richard Manning and Ran Prieur. They and many others offer insightful observations on our society, our plight and our possibilities. They speak with concern, caring and humaneness.

The film could easily be seen as a major bummer. The reality of our planetary situation is grim, and the movie pulls no punches. Depression and despair are expressed, discussed and absolutely not dismissed. Indeed the narrator cautions us toward the end of the film that there will be no happy closing chapter.

But the filmmakers are not without hope. Were they, there would have been no film. They leave us with the recognition that even if we are facing societal death, we can face that death with honor, knowing that we have tried everything we could to right the wrongs that we ourselves have created. If we lose, let that loss be noble. And maybe, just maybe, we might tap into that strength that comes from recognizing that all life on this earth is not just connected, but one. It would be a glorious finish, and even more glorious were we to come out successfully on the other side.

8248193,4,B0012YB9HG,"This film is an ambitious work of love by two people who did their homework and made a large statement concerning the confluence of a number of issues facing humanity in the here and now. Many works in print and film have addressed components of what is covered here, but none have put it all in a form that shows how they are all related.

Central to this film is the concept that humans have lived in a way that is against nature and that we have exceeded the carrying capacity of our planet- essentially using up the bounty of Earth faster than the natural processes can replace them, like someone depleting their life savings and all of their current earnings. This impacts the water we drink, the air we breathe, the land and oceans that feed us, the natural resources that clothe and house us and the nature that enriches our very life. Without a fundamental shift in not only human activity, but human outlook and values, can we hope to survive in anything like the life humans take for granted today.

There is a way to live with the earth and many ways to live against it. The posit of this film is that humankind has been living against nature and it threatens life on earth as we know it. The earth will,survive, but humans may well be the authors of their own destruction.

Highly recommended. Buy two copies and share one with a friend.",1463270400,3,1349,4.4534412955465585

8248197,5,B0012YB9HG,"This is the first documentary that hits every mark concerning issues of home destruction. I say home destruction instead of planet destruction because the earth will recover, but many species that call it home today won't survive. Certainly the altered state of the present day human race will not survive. The author/director engages experts with detailed explanations about sustainability. Reasons for problems associated with everyday living, which breeds discontent and fouls our environment, are explored in depth. I've never seen a more accurate account in one documentary explaining the reasons the United States lifestyle is unsustainable. It's not easy to watch, as it is reality and not corporation induced fantasy, but it is absolutely necessary to know. I wish it was required viewing in all schools!

Anyone who doesn't give this piece 5 stars just doesn't ""get it"", and, unfortunately, will probably continue existing in a ""business as usual"" lifestyle. Having watched it makes me want to be a better Earth Steward and gave me helpful guidelines. I can't believe you will watch this film and not be changed - for the better.

8248198,5,B0012YB9HG,"PLEASE INGNORE THOSE REVIEWERS WHO GAVE THIS DVD LESS FIVE STARS

Let me say firstly, that I have gone through many periods of denial and rejection in the last half a year whilst viewing all manner of documentaries that portray the human situation and there collective impact on other systems of the Planet Earth. However, I cannot help but see with better clarity the further I go into this exploration and journey and every time I go deeper the levels of denial and rejection become more ludicrous until finally the truth that humans are destroying the planet becomes irrefutable and plainly self-evident. We are depleting the sea of life by fishing for sea-food, we are poisoning the rivers and watersheds, we have turned most of our arable land into either desert of have poisoned it, we have caused ecological and environmental disasters that have caused other species to die out and the planet to warm beyond what many species can tolerate, we have destroyed over 90 % of the trees on the planet, and we are not even happier for it, in fact we are less happier than ever. Hmm...I wonder why that could be?

The reviewers who have given this a 1 star rating really have not understood the planets situation fully. It's really very simple. For our current monetary system, and by extension our industrial and technolgical society to survive it needs to constantly expand. Why? Because all the money is created out of loans (be it perusal, bank of national loans) or debt, it has no physical backing like gold or silver. What does this mean? It means two important things. 1) that we can keep lending as much money into existence, as it is not held back by an immediate physical reserve like gold or silver (in fact most money today is digitised or just numbers in computers) and 2) that because money is loaned into existence we have to pay interest on that loan which necessitates the pursuit of profit in any economical endeavour. Thus we are force to continue to expand (i.e. gain a profit) by our society (economically, and therefore industrially and commercially) because of the way money is created and used within our society. This traps us in a model that is essentially based on the premise that we can have continued growth within our economy. However, its not just about money, in order to have continued growth we would need an infinite supply of environmental resources like fossil fuels, minerals, wood, plant and animal life, water and soil. But this is impossible on a finite spherical planet: it just cannot sustain our model of continued growth. From this understanding of the economy, one can clearly see the effects on other systems within the planet such a model would have and is having.

The truth and stark clarity of the content of this DVD shows, without any sugar coating, the utter tragedy which humans have brought upon there own home. This film portrays, through brilliant synthesis, the most important issues of our times: THAT WE MAY IN ALL LIKELYHOOD SEE A GREAT REDUCTION IN ALL LIFE ON PLANT EARTH. This makes this one of the most important documentaries ever produced. While this may sound pretty harsh, viewers would be advised to weigh all the information out there before coming to a firm decision as to the possibility that human can or are causing a mass extinction.

Viewers who gave this less than 5 stars or only 1, perhaps have only had a cursory glance at the information without going into its details and impactions. When we first hear about the possibility of our industrial, technologically advance society collapsing or being unable to continue on its current trajectory of indefinite growth we are apt to think it is ludicrous rubbish spouted from over enthused doomsayers. LET THIS BE CLEAR. Too actually think along such dismissive lines is the mark of people who have only just started to scratch the serface of our current global situation and who perhaps have found it too scary a prospect to continue their journey. Perhaps they just go back into unconsciousness by watching repeats of Family Guy?

Anyway, I would advise people who but this DVD to go to the authors website and by the bundle pack which includes over 10 hours of lightly edited footage of all the people they interviewed for this DVD. These people are among the foremost commentators on today's planetary situation. It is a complete gem of a compilation, comprising of 3 bonus DVDs and I found it to be the most helpful thing yet in helping comprehend the larger picture of our current planetary climate; socially, ecologically, economically and environmentally. Again ignore the people, who gave this less a 1 star rating, they simply have not comprehended its content sufficiently.",1316131200,8,4712,4.826732673267327

8248200,5,B0012YB9HG,"I agree wholeheartedly with Mick Winter's 2/22/2008 review of the ""What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire"" documentary.

Ever since childhood I have been keenly aware that something was not quite right in ""River City.""  Since that time I have read much and viewed many documentaries that touch in singular depth upon the various elements that this documentary refers to.
But not until I viewed this documentary have I found anything that so succinctly combines and relates all of these elements within a single volume.

The first step in finding a solution to any problem is in recognizing that there is, in fact, a problem that needs solving.
In our too short (and ironically too long) lifespans we (especially those of us who have been fortunate enough to inhabit the wealthiest nations) may grow oblivious to the damage that our species imposes upon the world and the role that each of us plays as causative agents.

Although the documentary clips are most apropos to North American and Western societies, the message is universal and, in my opinion, This DVD should be REQUIRED VIEWING for EVERYONE upon the planet.

""What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire"" should be universally translated (at least with subtitles) in all languages and made AVAILABLE AT COST to anyone who wishes to FREELY DISTRIBUTE ITS MESSAGE.
I believe that is in the spirit of its message, and if the message is to have its opportunity to really inform and change us it must be seen and heard by most, if not all of us.
The message is just too important to be limited by lcensing fees and financial gain.",1285545600,6,1592,4.6512455516014235
8248201,5,B0012YB9HG,"I saw this film twice in the space of 24 hours. The first time I was a bit overwhelmed with its length, intensity and level of detail. The second time I cried through most of it. The primary message it convays is apocalyptic. It doesn't back away from the very strong possibility the human species will be extinct by the end of the century. I would say the primary motivation of the film is to break through the immense denial of modern industrialized society. If we really want to save the human species, it's probably not enough to change our lightbulbs and insulate our homes. We probably to quit our jobs to lobby government at all levels to take the necessary steps to reduce carbon emissions by 80% - which is what it's going to take in the industrial north.

The film does quite a good job at explaining fossil fuel depletion and the science of global warming and extreme weather events. It also talks a lot about denial and why individuals, communities and countries find it so hard to make the massive changes they know must occur.

It's convinced me. As of 10 weeks ago, I have left my job to work full time in my community lobbying for government support - at the national and local level - for the major lifestyle changes we all must make.
