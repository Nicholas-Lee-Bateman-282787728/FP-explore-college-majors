1828144,2,B000087F1N,"Continuing my quest to see everything Roger Corman ever directed, the best thing about this obscurity is its title, opening sequence and location photography.  One can appreciate the title without ever seeing the 60 minute movie itself, and the impact of Floyd Crosby's Hawaiian location photography has been greatly diminished by Alpha's poor transfer, which looks to be from a pretty good print but has been transferred to DVD with the brightness up much too high, making the few night scenes easier to watch than the many daytime shots.  That leaves only the opening sequence, a suspenseful nighttime dockside robbery, nicely staged and edited with no dialogue.  The rest of the film, minus Corman's usual stock company of actors or a script from ever-reliable writers like Charles B. Griffith, R. Wright Campbell, Robert Towne or Richard Matheson, is forgettable.",1077580800,2,867,5.223021582733813
1828145,2,B000087F1N,"""She-Gods of Shark Reef"" was the 20th film directed by the prolific Roger Corman in 1958, the same year that he made ""War of the Satellites,"" ""Teenage Cave Man,"" ""Machine-Gun Kelly,"" and ""I Mobster...The Life of a Gangster.""  Actually this film was shot in 1957, because whenever Corman traveled to shoot a film on location, like to Hawaii, he would usually shoot two films.  So ""She-Gods of Shark Reef"" was shot on the same location as 1957's ""Naked Paradise"" and then shelves by American International for a year until it was released on a double-bill with ""Night of the Blood Beast.""
The plot, which is really just an excuse to shoot beautiful native women on and about beautiful beaches, involves Chris (Bill Cord) and Jim Johnston (Don Durant), who end up shipwrecked on a strange island.  There the beautiful women do nothing but dive for pearls and engaging in strange rituals under the glaring eye of old Queen Pua (Jeanne Gerson).  Periodically she sacrifices young maidens to the sharks so that they will protect the underwater Tiki god.  Chris, who is handsome with blonde hair, falls in love with the lovely Mahia (Lisa Montell) while Jim, who is an ex-con and therefore has dark hair, is interested in making off with some of those pearls.  Look at the title and take a wild guess at what is going to happen to him.
This film is just a bit over an hour long and while Corman does a decent job of providing not only cheesecake but two heaping slices of beefcake in ""She-Gods of Shark Reef,"" this is a really bad print.  I usually do not pay a lot of attention to print quality, but this one is bad enough that I have to knock off another star.  Those who admire Corman's absolute pragmatism when it comes to making films will want to check this out to see yet another example of his celebrated approach to cinema, but this is no where near being a keeper.  Final Note: The title song, ""Nearer My Love to You,"" sung by Jack Lawrence and Frances Hall, actually received some airplay.  He was the lyricist on ""If I Didn't Care,"" ""Tenderly,"" and ""All or Nothing at All.""
The song gets this back up to 2.5, but I am still rounding down because of the bad print.",1066694400,5,2168,4.521739130434782
1828146,2,B000087F1N,"Nothing really makes sense in this film, but then, as it was an obvious B film B film (i.e.- made as a double feature filler for an B film that was top billed (or an A B film?)). But, in such a film, can anything really be expected? I mean, the buff guys are bland, the babes are bland. Even the sharks are bland. On the plus side, the sharks used in this film are much more realistic than the mechanical shark used in Spielberg's Jaws, made nearly 20 years later. Some reviewers have claimed the sharks were real, but dead, yet, even in scenes of the attacks on humans one can see movements of the head that are not done with cords or anything guiding them. So, kudos on this one small point for Corman and company. Of course, given the film's release on a public domain DVD package, there is no quality in the print used. The colors in the film are faded and almost sepia. A cheesy opening ballad plays over the opening credits. Then the music gets worse. The acting is wooden, the screenplay abysmal, and there isn't even much fun exhibited in this atrocity. Yet, I must say I love s*** like this. Thankfully, there is not a pretentious moment in this film. Hell, we never even get to know why the hell Lee and the swami guy killed the guy on the dock in the opening scene. Of course, stuff like this always happens in films like this. A few years later, in Coleman Francis's abysmal The Beast Of Yucca Flats, a similar murder opens that film, and goes its length similarly unexplained. Well, on second thought, I guess it's not really unexplained for, as Mahia philosophizes when she pleads, at film's end, to Chris, they must leave the evil on the island behind. So, that's it- Lee was just evil. After all, he made a smart aleck remark to his brother implying he wanted to bring Mahia back with them so he could pimp her. Or was it Pua that was evil? Or both? Well, Lee's dead, so it must be....oh, hell.

  She Gods Of Shark Reef is a film that is good for one reason- killing time when one is too lazy or wired to do anything else. On that level, it succeeds as well as....drooling. Ah, but what drools are made of....or something poetic sounding like that.",1359676800,,2165,4.327586206896552
1828147,2,B000087F1N,"Aside from having Roger Corman's name on the cover of this film there is a picture of a wet blond just wearing only a strategically placed lei.
No blonds.
No She Gods.
And the lei is broken.
Looks like Roger was distracted by the other movie he was making at the same time ""Thunder Over Hawaii.""

The basic story is bad guy (who gets into killing and gunrunning) flees authorities with his brothers help. A storm arises and they get shipwrecked on a mysterious island with native girls, sharks, pearls, and a nasty old woman.

So who gets the native girls, sharks, pearls, or worse yet the nasty old woman?",1359244800,,606,4.5
1828148,2,B000087F1N,"If you have ever wondered why Roger Corman was once considered a master of schlock, watch this movie.  The plot is thin and the title is more than a little misleading.

Two brothers are apparently in the process of smuggling guns when guards catch them.  One of the two guards is veteran actor Ed Nelson, who had a significant career, mostly in television, after his bit role in this movie.  After killing one of the guards, the two brothers are on the lam.  Unfortunately their boat sinks when it hits a reef.  Women from an island (the movie credits the territory of Hawaii) where there are only women rescue the two.

Now the movie gets really exciting.  There is a romance between the ""good"" brother Chris Johnston and an island girl.  ""Bad"" brother Lee Johnston (Don Durant, who would soon be the star of the television show ""Johnny Ringo"") learns that the women have been diving for pearls.  Lee has a little theft in mind.  Lee is also the brother that killed the guard.

Queen Pua (Jeanne Gerson) catches on and signals for the police to come to the island and take the brothers away.  The brothers learn about the police and leave the island.  However, they are afraid of running into the police, so they land on a reef to wait until night.  Lee returns to the island to steal the pearls, severely injuring or killing one of the women in the process.  Once Lee returns, the curse of the Shark God apparently takes effect, and Chris and girlfriend Mahia (Lisa Montell, who appeared in a variety of roles into the early 1960's, mostly on television) barely escape.

Mixed into this story are rituals and some mumbo jumbo about a god on the reef.  The reef god appears to manifest as sharks.  The women are not gods.  Most of the women seem to be nave.  Many of the women are quite homely.

On top of all this, the picture quality was poor.

There are some movies that you watch once to say that you did, and then plan to not watch the movie ever again.  This movie is one of those.  This movie is so weak that even ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" might have had difficulty with it.  This movie is only for those collecting Roger Corman's movies or those who have a collection of movies about island gods and island women.  Everyone else, stay away.

This movie appears to be in the public domain, which likely accounts for the poor video quality and occasional problems with the sound.  On the other hand, because the movie seems to be in the public domain it can be acquired from several sources relatively inexpensively, including as part of a couple of collections of movies.

Good luck!",1339545600,,2596,4.520430107526882

1828150,5,B000087F1N,"She-Gods Of Shark Reef was one of the many films directed by Roger Corman. It is about two brothers who stow away on a ship and after a violent tropical storm, they maroon on a island in the South Pacific inhabited by only females. One of the brothers right away falls in love with a Polynesian maiden despite the objections of her stern and strict mistress. The other brother was planning to steal the pearls from the female islanders but not before he met his fate with the sharks. Among the classic films of the late 1950's, this would place as my personal favorites.",1187049600,,570,4.490384615384615
1828151,1,B000087F1N,"This is perhaps not the very worst Roger Corman movie, but it's definitely in the running. While it may not be the worst, it is certainly the most boring. The film revolves around two brothers, one of whom is a fugitive, becoming shipwrecked on an island of women after running aground on a coral reef just offshore. This is way less exciting than you would imagine. What is more amazing is that this was made in Kauai, possibly the most beautiful place in the United States. It is amazing how dull Corman can make this place look (the very poor color balance does not help), but then again, he is the indisputable master of schlock.

After becoming stranded, there is a lot of footage of catamarans paddling around, ""Polynesian"" dancing and ceremonies, and a couple of fights. One of the brothers falls in love with a native girl (of course) but is forbidden to date her by the tribal elder. This does not go over well, and the brothers and girl decide to escape in a catamaran. There are two principle flaws with their escape plan as I understand it: one, they elect to kidnap and take the cranky old lady tribal elder along with them for some reason (apparently to make their journey much less hospitable and noisier); and two, they set sail for another island, yet by the time they are about a half mile offshore decide that their only hope is to make for the coral reef. This makes me wonder two things in turn: what was the plan to get off the reef; and, wasn't this the reef that smashed up their much larger boat and stranded them in the first place?

After getting onto the reef there are subplots about pearls, some more fighting, and a battle with a shark that is smaller and less scary than Charlie the tuna. All in all, this is unbelievably lame.

There is one redeeming quality that this movie has, though: it is very short. Clocking in at 64 minutes, you can watch the entire thing during a single treadmill workout, like I did, although it will make the workout much more painful and seem much longer.

I can't recommend this film even to diehard fans of bad movies. I recommend this film only to fans of very boring movies.",1138492800,4,2140,4.465473145780051
1828152,2,B000087F1N,"Virginal sacrifices to awesome shark gods.  An island full of beautiful, scantily-clad women.  Filmed on location in Hawaii.  Sounds like something worth watching, doesn't it?  Unfortunately, only the Hawaii thing applies to Roger Corman's She Gods of Shark Reef.  I can confirm no virgin sacrifices (although a couple of the local pearl-diving females are MIA), there is not the first instance of blood in the water, the shark god himself would easily fit in your bathtub (and, to tell the truth, I'm not completely convinced it was even a shark), and I spotted only one attractive female on the island.  And the scantily-clad business applies only to the two men who wash up on the shores of the island in question.  Having had their own clothes ripped to shreds when their boat struck a reef and went down, they are forced to don miniskirts that are entirely too small.  I mean, there's a serious Buffalo Shot Warning in effect for this entire film.  Apparently, Corman was having so much fun on his Hawaiian vacation (uh, I mean two-for-one film shoot on location) that he quite forgot that an exploitation film is supposed to feature scantily-clad women, not dangerously under clothed men.

There's not a lot to this film, which plays as if it were thought up on the spur of the moment while Corman was shooting Naked Paradise in 1957 (it would not appear until some 18 months later, alongside Night of the Blood Beast).  The movie starts out with some guy apparently stealing something and killing a guy in the process (but who knows, thanks to the dark print we're stuck with?), then we see him and his brother being rescued from certain death by the pearl diving females of the little island off of Shark Reef's.  It looks like they'll be stuck there for ten days, but the criminal fellow can't wait that long because he knows the cops are after him.  His brother is fairly content, however, which has a lot to do with the island's only attractive inhabitant, Mahia (Lisa Montell).  The hag running the show, who huffs and puffs over the men's presence and the anger it is causing the shark god, keeps sending out messages via semaphore - to whom, heaven only knows, since the supply boat is still several days out.  Then a sacrifice is arranged in order to placate the angry god, and that's when our shipwrecked duo decides it's time to steal a boat and make a run for it - with Mahia in tow, of course.  What about the shark, you ask?  Surely there's a good old-fashioned shark attack in here somewhere?  Well, not exactly.  And don't even talk to me about any she gods; let's just say that Shark Reef is the only thing the film's title came close to getting right.

You don't expect any Roger Corman film to be good, but this one is even more disappointing than most.  The movie looks awful, it's sometimes difficult to make out what the characters are saying, there's only one remotely interesting character in the whole film, and the shark god is so small that Barney Fife could take him in a fight.  Thank heavens for Lisa Montell, as she is the only thing this movie has going for it.",1137196800,3,3099,4.596363636363637

Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 1, Side B, first feature, SHE-GODS OF SHARK REEF, directed by Roger Corman and starring no one you've ever heard of.

Roger Corman gets a good bit of notoriety these days as being a B-movie guru who was able to turn crap into gold, though personally, I think most of that comes from the fact that he was involved in so many films (over 400 production credits and over 50 director credits) at a time when the largest generation of Americans were coming of age.  Was he influential?  You bet - he has to be one of the most watched 'auteurs' ever.  That fact alone almost guarantees the notion that he would influence future directors and impress film buffs with his techniques (which were most likely born out of necessity - limited budgets, less qualified actors, poor filming locations, and a short schedule.)

Does that mean all his films are worth seeing?  No, not really.  Sometimes they are quirky and offbeat, sometimes unintentionally hilarious, and, more rarely, classic.  I like to give his films a chance because they can be so outrageous - the first time I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2000/dp/B00BVGQGU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2000</a>&nbsp;it really knocked me out.  I hadn't been expecting anything, and then here was this totally bizarre, over-the-top black comedy that came out of nowhere.  And because of films like that, it now seems that there is this idea, pushed by a lot of cheap production companies who peddle his films, that ALL his films were like that.  They plaster his name on the DVD as if it's a guarantee.

Well, SHE-GODS OF SHARK REEF is no DEATH RACE 2000.  Two brothers on the run are shipwrecked and saved from the sharks by the beautiful Mahia.  Upon coming ashore though, they find the matron-in-command of the all-female island is also the high priestess of a vicious shark cult, and when she decides the two brothers have angered the Shark God, somebody is going to get sacrificed.  The brothers kick sand in the face of her plan though, and devise their escape.  Unfortunately the stress of their actions tears the bonds of fraternal admiration, and it looks like the Shark God may get his offering after all.

Meh.  Melodramatic and obvious, though Mahia is certainly attractive enough to keep our attention.  Since this is in the 'Sci-Fi' classics set, I kept expecting the island beauties to be some sort of weird experiment at turning sharks into beautiful women,  la THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, but no - it was all pretty pedestrian.  Is this one of Roger Corman's influential classics?  Nope.  Just a B-flick with a microscopic budget and a beautiful setting with some gorgeous women.

If it was another 30 minutes I think it would have gone a bit long in the tooth. It was ok. I enjoyed the tropical setting, there was a bit of adventure and derring'-do.  End result was predictable, by about the 20 minute mark we knew who was coming out of this one, and not only who was not, but how.

  A little glum that the only underwater fighting scene was between two men.

  Lots of silliness in this one.  I was not a fan of the islands semephore system by flag, apparently to alert another island of the goings on. You would need to be standing just under the flagpole to see it. I do no believe for one second people could swim back and forth from a ""dangerous reef"" that could cripple boats on a whim. The ""sharks"" of ""Shark Reef""  were about as intimidating as the goldfish in a doctors offices' tank, but its implied they could get the job done.

  So, at the end of the day we had some drama, a lot of pretty women standing around most of the time, though sometimes they row boats around, some gratuitous hula dance scenes, a guy whomping another one over the head with a sack of pearls, a giant stone thing under the water seemingly pulling the strings, and an annoying old woman whose every action was dictated by a curse. It all wraps with what I suppose what is supposed to be a happy ending, although I will go on record as saying Chris and Mahia are one of my least favorite couples every put to film, and if I saw them on an island vacation I would turn around and fly home.

  Overall, didn't mind this movie though. Campy fun.",1366675200,2,1649,4.157728706624606
