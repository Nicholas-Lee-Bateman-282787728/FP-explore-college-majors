8569777,4,B00BJPYUPG,"Live action movies can be expected to deviate from the manga or anime plot, I suppose. This was filmed before the end of the original storyline, so don't expect the official ending. That being said, the quality of the movie is fine, but the subtitles are a little goofy here and there. It was still enjoyable, though!",1420934400,,317,4.578947368421052

The package arrived on time and quickly.
I would like to point out a typo on the front of the case however, both actors have the same name in English on it.
In the movie, there were more than a few grammatical errors in the subtitles.
I just wanted to have a copy of this movie however, and these didn't really bother me. It was more a sense of amusement.
The movie it self was good, and it felt nice to have an ending because the anime is still ongoing.
Buzz Aldrin makes an appearance, and let's just say that there is a reason he was an astronaut and not an actor. It was very funny though!
Overall I am happy with my kind of quirky purchase and I am glad to own a copy of Space Brothers! ;)",1381881600,2,721,4.013888888888889
