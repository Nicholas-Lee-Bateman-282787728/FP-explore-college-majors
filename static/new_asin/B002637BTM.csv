8351739,5,B002637BTM,"I was new to Yoga and after finding that to be quite enjoyable, I was interested in trying Pilates. I honestly didn't know the exact differences between the two. I had the impression that Pilates focused on working different parts of the body, mainly the core. I also wanted to find a Pilates video that allowed me to follow along without needing the use of any machines so I found this ""Mat pilates"" video.

The Pilates instructor taught well and was very clear in guiding you through the routine. I took a little to get used to compared to my Yoga workout because the Pilates workout was a little faster paced and lasted about 40 minutes or so straight through. I enjoyed the quicker pace of this workout. Since I am new to Pilates, I am not sure if they all are like this or not but it sure did give my mid-section a workout.

She shows you many Pilates moves geared exactly for beginners. If you are looking for a good Pilates video to start you off with, I would highly recommend this video.",1244678400,16,996,4.378378378378378
