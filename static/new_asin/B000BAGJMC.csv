8084026,5,B000BAGJMC,"I bought this for my 3yo grandson who just loves Bob as well as Thomas the Train. He opened this video,his ""follow me scoop"" and a ""thomas"" toolbox,said ""thank you"" then proceeded up to his room---that's all he needed for Christmas!!",1199836800,,233,4.7073170731707314
8084027,4,B000BAGJMC,"The stories on this one are good, but they have new voices for some of the characters. I liked the old ones best. Bob always sounded so sweet and kind. The new Bob voice is all right, but different. Overall it is still a great DVD.",1181692800,,231,4.043478260869565
