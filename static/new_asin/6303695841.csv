706716,4,6303695841,"Wow.
 Even on budget dvd (spotty print quality, meaningless background music) watching Paul Wegener's 1920 THE GOLEM is quite an experience.
 It's 16th century Prague and the stars imply, and the Emperor impels, an eviction of the ghetto Jews.  Their crimes - practicing the black arts, despising Holy Christian ceremonies, etc.  In desperation Rabbi Loew, nominal leader of the ghetto, invokes the dread spirit Astaroth to reveal the magic word that will bring the Golem to life.
 The Golem is a large clay figure in the form of a man.  This faithful servant of Rabbi Loew's possesses superhuman strength and seems invulnerable - daggers bend and break rather than penetrate its skin.  It accompanies Rabbi Loew to the Emperor's palace on a mission to have the edict revoked, and the Golem is instrumental in accomplishing that goal.
 Of course, the movie reminds us of the dictum that should be engraved on the hearts of all mad scientists everywhere - ""If you have brought the dead to life through magic, beware that life.""  The last third of the movie shows what happens when Man's creation stop obeying the will of their creators.
 For me, the big hurdle to clear when watching silent movies is to realize they're NOT over acting.  Without sound, emotions have to be expressed with some exaggeration.  If you're afraid, eyes pop and mouth gapes and curled fingers cover your face.  With sound that type of acting looks ridiculous.  This is the second silent movie I've watched recently, and it's getting easier.  The acting here is fine.
 It's amazing how familiar everything looks.  The sets, with walls cantered at weird angles and their organic architecture (there's a spiral stone staircase that seems to have been carved from standing rock), would fit comfortably in a Tim Burton movie.  I've seen the painted starscape and arched gables in Charles Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.  The Golem busts down the ghetto gate just like King Kong, and confronts the little blonde girl in the same manner as Karloff did in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
 I imagine all this was a lot scarier then than it is now, but it's still well worth everyone's time.  If the score and print quality had been higher, I would have given this one five stars.",1082764800,36,2241,4.844736842105263
706717,4,6303695841,"The Golem is a terrific film from the silent era. The story is compelling, the setting is marvellous, and the look of the film overall is perfect for a story such as this. I won't bore everyone with a summary, but merely say that this film is for anyone who likes gothic horrors/thillers and maybe has an interest in reliogious issues.
Kino's DVD is the finest version of the film yet. Not all films are given the treatment that Metropilis recently got, but the restoration done of The Golem is quite nice. I can't say I care much for the colour tinting, but that's a small quibble. The music composed for the film is appropriate, but not great. Certainly not as good as the very fine scores written by Timothy Brock for Kino's releases of Faust and The Last Laugh - I wonder what he could have done.
In any case, The Golem is worth adding to your collection if you like silent classics and supernatural thillers. I wouldn't rank it as high as Lang or Murnau's work, but it IS a terrific film.",1055462400,7,993,4.4021739130434785
706718,5,6303695841,"THE GOLEM is a landmark in filmmaking because it was the very first of the silents, after Edison's long-lost and sought after production of FRANKENSTEIN in 1910 to present to the cinema the art of camera movement to provide suspense and horror. A movement very popularly mesmerizing through German Expressionism. Seeing this film to mind brings comparisons to the later FRANKENSTEIN films which no doubt had a strong influence on James Whale. There were actual rumors that for Bela Lugosi's screen test for the Monster he was built heavily of clay, and had a wig very much resembling Paul Wegener's Golem.
This DVD is much better than the three pack of Golem/Caligari/Nosferatu released several years ago, because like the individual DVD releases of Caligari and Nosferatu (with the curious exception of Metropolis) the film's actual tints and title cards are restored, thus viewers are able to see what they initially missed through earlier VHS releases.
Paul Wegener's Golem is very much portrayed as a precursor to Karloff's Frankenstein Monster. Hulking, sympathetic, misunderstanding, easily crossed, and feared by all except children. The films imagery is remarkable with the astrological symbols and sights of the stars in the sky, making the film atmospherical and at the same time suspenseful. The scene in which Rabbi Loew (Albert Steinruck) harbors black magic by spawning a ring of fire about him whilst spelling the magic words of ASTAROTH is still spellbinding after 80 years.
Legends of creatures made from clay are as old as recorded history. These were artificial men made of clay or mud, which was brought to life when the name of God is pronounced over it. Some stories say that it is then able to understand orders and is just great for doing housework. Others say that it can be used as a frightening type of bodyguard. Either way, it seemed that if you had a pet golem, there would be trouble right around the corner. On its' forehead is written the Jewish word EMETH, which means ""truth"". Every day the golem would become bigger and bigger, and heavier and heavier. Finally it would become a nuisance, if not a downright danger, to have it around the house. So the first letter of the word on his forehead must be rubbed out. The inscription now would read METH, which now would mean ""he is dead"". The golem would collapse and turn into clay once again. One story w&#16481;s told of a golem that grew so tall and large that its' master could not reach its forehead to rub out the magic letter. So the golem was ordered to take off its shoes. When it bent over to do this, its' master quickly erased the first letter. Unfortunately the golem turned into a huge lump of clay and fell on top of its' master, thereby crushing him to death. Rabbi Loew has a different method by simply snatching the magical symbol from the Golem's chest.
For those of you who own the recent VHS releases and want to know the name of the beautiful music piece heard throughout the film, it is ""Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Minor"" composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. Karl Freund and Edgar G. Ulmer (who later directed the 1934 classic THE BLACK CAT) give the film their usual fantastic photography to the film. Lyda Salmonova is still an eye opener as Miriam, and look fast for Greta Schroeder (who appeared later as Ellen in NOSFERATU) as a flower girl.",1039824000,11,3355,4.766323024054983
706719,5,6303695841,"This 1921 version of ""The Golem"" (""Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam"") is a remake of a 1915 silent film.  In both the Golem is played by Paul Wegener, who also played the title character in the 1917 ""The Golem and the Dancing Girl"" (""Der Golem und die Tnzerin"").  The Jewish legend of the goldem is set this time around in 16th century Prague, which is supposedly when Rabbi Loew (Albert Steinrck) created the giant golem from clay to defend the Jews from the persecution by the local despot.  However, the rabbi's assistant, Famulus (Ernst Deutsch) takes control of the golem and sends it forth to do his nefarious bidding, which includes abducting the beautiful Miriam (Lyda Salmonova), the Rabbi's beloved daughter.  However, the Golem's will can not be perverted in such a manner.  Much is made of ""The Golem"" being one of the first monster movies, and certainly this film incorporates a lot of elements that would become basic components of a lot of classic horror films.  But I think ""The Golem"" deserves to be considered the first superhero film.  After all, the creature was not created to be a monster, but to be a heroic figure of deliverance, and I would suggest that is the more important reading of the film in the long run.
None of this detracts from the point that ""The Golem"" is a classic silent monster movie, that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with ""Nosferatu"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  I would agree that ""The Golem"" is a lesser example of German expressionism; certainly it is not as textbook as ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" or ""Nosferatu.""  Certainly Wegner, his figure esconced in ""clay,"" is not capable of over emoting in any way.  This leads me to another coment: Granted, there are strong similarities between the Golem and Karloff's performance in ""Frankenstein"" and it would not be surprising if Karloff had seen this silent film.  But I would like to point out that the shuffling movements of both performances are logical consequences of being either a figure made out of clay or reanimated dead body parts.  Karloff was a fine enough actor to have figured this out, even without the inspiration offered by this film.
Ultimately, I am more concerned over the attempts to make a political reading of the film, premised on the fact that this is a German film (read ""proto-Nazi"").  In terms of the film this idea is premised on the contrast between the shabby, dark-haired children of the Jewish ghetto shown throughout most of the film with the happy, blonde-haired children that surround the Golem at the end.  For the latter, of course, there is a temptation to read the children as being Aryan and to comment on the irony of the impending Holocaust given such the visual oxymoron.  But the simpler explanation to me is the contrast between the dark and the light as reflecting the oppressive Dionysian part of the film with its happier Apollian conclusion.  Besides, I would have a hard time arguing a film where the main characters are Jewish can be rightly characterized as Anti-Semetic.  The film employs stereotypes, but that was a cultural commonplace that extended beyond Jews at that time in popular culture (cf. the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs).  Certainly the Emperor Luhois (Otto Gebhr) is a stereotypical despot.
There are lots of ways of reading ""The Golem,"" so in the final analysis the important thing would be that you see it for yourself and make up your own mind on these issues.  I think that however you read this film, it will end up high on your list for silent films in this genre.",1038009600,5,3559,4.720516962843296
706720,5,6303695841,"My love affair with silent films began with ""The Golem"".  I was introduced to this movie on a wintry January night, with the lights off.  The flickering images, the ""Brandenburg Concerto"" soundtrack, and the film's angular sets, left a lasting impression on me, and it wasn't long before I started dreaming in black and white with a classical score.  I watched it again this year, at midnight on Halloween, and was captivated all over again.<...
The story of the Golem is timeless (it even made a recent appearance in ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"").  The creature is brought to life from clay to protect the inhabitants of a medieval Jewish community from destruction at the hands of the Emperor.  But the prophecies from which he's born also foresee his turning against his creators, and those are of course fulfilled when the Rabbi's daughter carries on an affair with the Emperor's knight.  The Golem's death is a stunning moment, coming from a most unexpected pair of hands.
The look of the film (if you can discern it on VHS) is remarkable.  The village's homes and towers are stark angular shapes, jutting up against a starry night sky.  The appearance of the demon Astaroth, who reveals the Golem's secrets, is remarkably realized, as are the words that form from his breath.
The legend changes with each telling, but the core details should be familiar to most, and are echoed in many other sources down through history (the ""Frankenstein"" parallels are easy to see).  If you can secure a good print of this movie (or even if you can't), the images will stay with you for a long time.",1036195200,74,1606,4.748201438848921
706721,5,6303695841,"This is simply a marvelous film; a classic in every sense of the word!  Up until now, the only version of this available on DVD was part of the 3-disc set ""Early Masterworks Of The German Horror Cinema"".  That version was a bit disappointing for two reasons: first there was no music soundtrack, and the other was the grainy quality of the print used.
The quality of this DVD is immaculate; the accompanying music score is excellent, and it's very obvious from the opening shot that this company went to great lengths (and expense) to restore this film.  The only minor problem is the color tinting that was utilized to enhance each scene; in some instances, the tinting is somewhat overpowering and nearly washes out some of the scenery (especially when the red tinting is present).  Otherwise, this is as pristine a print and restoration that you will ever see in any form; an excellent job all around!
As many have pointed out, this film was perceived as the basis for ""Frankenstein"", although a silent version of Frankenstein appeared prior in 1910, and is very rare on video.  Paul Wegener is outstanding as the title character Golem, and Greta Schroeder puts in a brief appearance here two years prior to her more memorable performance in the classic ""Nosferatu"".
I highly recommend this DVD!",1035244800,8,1298,4.802690582959642
706722,5,6303695841,"THE GOLEM is one of those movies that many people have seen stills from or have read about but up until now have not the opportunity to see it as it was intended to be seen. Copies of it have been around for years but as was often the case with silent films until recently, it was available only in poor quality prints projected at the wrong speed with inappropriate or no music background at all. This new Kino DVD remedies that situation and is likely to be the best edition we're likely to see for some time.

The story concerns a Jewish ghetto in 16th century Prague which is saved by the creation of a clay man who is brought to life and becomes their protector. After his task is finished, he refuses to return to clay and runs amok until he is finally vanquished by the hands of a child. This is a remake of an earlier film which also featured writer and co-director Paul Wegener as the creature. Much of the Golem legend would be used by Mary Shelley in FRANKENSTEIN and this movie would be recycled by James Whale and Boris Karloff for the famous 1931 film. It is fascinating to watch this film today not only for its highly stylised sets and striking cinematography but also for its positive portrayal of Jewish life which was possible in 1920 Germany but not 13 years later.

This is by far and away the best version of this film that I have seen. It is still a little washed out in places but the restored tinting helps to minimize that. Most of the print is sharp and clear with the stylised details quite vivid especially in the ghetto scenes. The newly composed soundtrack by Aljoscha Zimmermann incorporates Jewish melodies with folk dance material and is very effective. This is one of four new releases in Kino's German Horror Classics series that also features authorized versions of CABINET OF DR CALIGARI (a knockout), NOSFERATU, and the rarely seen WAXWORKS. They can be obtained seperately or all together in a box set.

Shappy raves about the soundtrack - it should be noted however that this version's soundtrack is not original but rather is the cycle of Brandenburg Concertos and one orchestral suite of J.S.Bach.

After the Jews being ousted from the town by royal decree, the  leader of the Jewish community crafts the Golem out of clay and brings him  to life in a black magical ceremony (interesting to note that among the  crimes accused of the Jews in the edict, one was witchcraft). The Golem  then is brought before the king and results in the Jews being allowed to  remain. But the Golem falls in love(!) with a young lady and runs amok. The  story is a classic and there is a considerable amount of drama here, but  the real gem of this movie are the incredible visuals and the atmosphere.

706874,5,6303695841,"The Golem is a movie based on an old Jewish folktale about a Rabbi who brings to life a clay man to defend the Jews of a Ghetto in Prague during the 1600's. Written, directed and staring Paul  Wegner as the Golem this silent film is fun to watch. Some people wonder if Mary Shelly was influenced by the legend of the Golem when writing he book Frankenstein.  There is no direct evidence that supports this theory and there are some differences.  The movie tells the story of a group of Jews living in the Prague Ghetto, when the Emperor decides to empty the Ghetto of all Jews.  Rabbi Low or Lowe using forbidden magic from the Kabbalah, brings the Golem to life. The Golem is an enjoyable movie and the one classic scene is the Monster carrying off the beautiful woman in his arms.  Another German film released the same year, the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari also has a scene of the ""monster"" carrying off a beautiful woman.  Since both films came out the same year a few months apart, the Cabinet came out first so it is credited as the first ""horror"" film, both movies influenced all the Horror films to follow.  I enjoyed the movie and there is drama, a love story and a bit of comedy.  The Monster is destroyed in the most unlikely manner. I would recommend both films.  I would also recommend the movie Frankenstein, made 11 years later in 1931.  The scene with a little girl is almost the same, except how each ends.",1439683200,2,1419,4.402298850574713

706996,4,6303695841,"This review is for the Alpha Video DVD of the Golem.  The front cover has large gold/yellow lettering at the top, with the Golem facing the little girl underneath.  The back cover has the following information about the publisher:  ""Package design copyright 2002 Alpha Video Distributors, Inc. Box 35, Narberth, PA 19072.""  Below that is the website location:  www. oldies.com.

Note that the Amazon.com product information above has the running time of this edition as 91 minutes, but unless Alpha has changed the DVD contents since 2002 (while keeping exactly the same cover), that is wrong.  In fact, even the back cover of the Alpha DVD case has the wrong running time; it says that this version is only 85 minutes long, but I have just watched it twice, and it is 101 minutes long!  So the Amazon.com product information is doubly wrong:  it doesn't reflect the incorrect running time on the back of the DVD cover, and it doesn't reflect the real running time.  The running time for this product should be changed to 101 minutes.  I would try to submit the change, but I have no proof, since the information on the DVD case is wrong.  Amazon would just have to take my word for it that the version pictured in fact runs 101 minutes.  If any reader here knows how to go about changing the running time without proof, he or she is welcome to try.

This may be even be the full original length of the film, since (as far as I can see) there are no spots in the film where there seem to be any gaps in the story, and all story elements seem quite fully developed.  But I am no expert on early German silent films, so I can't claim that as more than a plausible inference; I have no historical knowledge regarding the film's production.  What I do know, however, is that I like to have the longest available version of any film.  And this 101-minute version seems to fit that description.

There are no extras on this DVD, and the chapter menu is next to useless:  only 4 stops for 101 minutes!  This is an annoyance, but only a minor one.  Another annoyance:  whoever wrote the plot summary on the back of the Alpha Video mangled it considerably.  The writer has misunderstood parts of the plot.  But again, this is minor; it can just be ignored.

The good news is that the video is reasonably good throughout -- for a 1920 silent film that appears to have had no restoration done on it.  There are no breaks or jumps in the film, that I can detect.  There are not many thin vertical lines, sparkles, etc.  I see no blotches, tears, etc.  Mostly the picture is clean.  It's a bit on the dark side, and perhaps the white/black contrast could be better, but in a film 94 years old, one does not expect perfection.  And for all I know the director wanted a dark look -- that would fit the story.  Anyhow, while we would all like gorgeously restored prints of every old movie, that is not going to happen, and you can watch this version of the Golem without wincing at the picture quality -- and that is better than can be said of some surviving talkie movies of the 30s and 40s.

The sound (i.e., the musical score, since there is no talking) is clear; it cuts out in two places (without affecting the video); once for about 10 seconds, and once a little later for about 30 seconds.  I assume that the soundtrack was defective in the print Alpha used.  But hey, I'd rather be missing a less than a minute of sound than 10 minutes or more of the picture -- which is what you will be missing with other editions.

Another Amazon poster, Dr. Sam Stern, writing about this Alpha Video version (his review was posted in March 2014), claims to have identified the composer of the orchestral score.  He says that it is Bruckner's Symphony #2 in C Minor.  A commenter on his claim says that he has identified only part of musical sources.  I take no sides, but report it for those who are interested.  I will say that I think the orchestral score is very suited to the dark grandeur of the film.

I'm not inclined to dock Alpha much for no extras, when they have put out the longest version of this film currently available.  So you get the longest print, for a bargain-basement price.  There is nothing to complain about here.  This is a good, moody, silent film with a very interesting plot, influential on all later horror and science fiction films, and it's possibly the full original theatrical version.  This purchase is a no-brainer.  This deserves at least four stars, maybe five if you take into account the price.",1417910400,4,4513,4.462102689486553

Many films of that period used a sort of Aesop's Fables approach with a moral lesson being imparted to the audience; but more importantly The Golem in particular serves as a historic document of medieval anti-semitic attitudes portrayed in the setting of the film.

Furthermore I couldn't help getting away from the feeling that there was a taint of underlying cultural ignorance on behalf of the writer and director, which kept nagging at me. I could be completely wrong about this as I am not a learned scholar of film or film makers of that period and I do not wish to cast false aspersions or make false assumptions.

Having said all that, The Golem is entertaining but more importantly this movie is an important historical document of early film making that is a rich source of much discussion and debate from many perspectives.",1416096000,,926,4.709876543209877
706999,5,6303695841,"The most wondrous and imaginative part of this film was the music.  Yes, it may be a gift to the early art of film, but the music was far advanced and beyond its time.  With such Stravinsky and Bartok qualities, I was thoroughly engrossed in the combination of the film and the music as simultaneous expression that transcended ordinary thought and imagination by leaps and bounds.  I was unaware of this piece before viewing, and most of all hearing it and I am grateful for the experience at my rather advanced age to see filmmaking so enhanced by a musical score as to make them inseparable in my memory.  My ignorance as to its existence serves to make it a found treasure.  That a piano, cello and violin could deliver the entire score without a hint of humdrum repetition was enlightening because I thought I had already been exposed to all the genius that there was.  How silly of me.

Do not view this film for entertainment, you will be greatly disappointed.  If you view it with the expectation of early 20th century music and its ability to enhance early filmmaking, you will be astounded.",1416009600,3,1100,4.605128205128205

This movie pre-sages the following century in human-created vs human, with many of the questions that come up. Wegener's first 1915 version came just as the Czech film -- Rossum's Universal Robots -- brought up our fascination with robots. The Golem is even more a story of our idea of robots.

Count me as a lover of this movie, which helped introduce me to the silent film genre.  Yes, it's splotchy, with poor lighting typical of the 1920 era. But this film clearly heavily influenced the Karloff version of Frankenstein in many, obvious ways.
  Now, about the music.  Some reviewers consider it ""meaningless"".  To each their own.  Other versions of Golem used different music, e.g., the Brandenburg Concerto.  However, in this particular version, shown above with the yellow ""Golem"" lettering and little girl....  after more than 5 years of searching I finally discovered the beautiful (in my opinion) background music:  Bruckner's Symphony #2 in C minor.  It uses themes from the first movement, for the most part.  Gorgeous, atmospheric music.  It was very difficult finding this because, as noted by another reviewer, the DVD and case have no music credits whatsoever.  After years of detective work and some knowledge of classical music, I gradually narrowed it down from ""some kind of German Romantic music"", through ""possibly Brahms or Mahler"", and finally realized ""it's Bruckner's 2nd!"".

""The Golem"" is based on a figure from Jewish legend.  In order to protect the Jewish community, a clay figure is made and animated to serve as a guardian and righter of wrongs.  As in most of these stories, the creation becomes more than the creator intended and must meet the fate of all such creatures that get out of control.

707269,5,6303695841,"Preceding James Whales' FRANKENSTEIN by over a decade, this tragic Promethean tale of a man-made monster that wreaks havoc on a small Jewish ghetto resonates just as strongly with today's audiences as it had nearly a century ago. In THE GOLEM, the revered Rabbi Loew predicts that a terrible fate will befall the Jews of Prague, which comes in the form of an edict from the Emperor that calls for each of the Jews to be removed from the city. Rabbi Loew shapes a giant protector out of clay in order to save his people, and then steals the word of life from the demon Astaroth during a magic ceremony. The Golem awakes and serves the rabbi faithfully, warding off the Emperor and his guards... That is, until the stars align and break the spell that binds the creature. Its rampage leaves the town in ruin, and leaves the Rabbi Loew to stop it once and for all! THE GOLEM is most recognized for Paul Wegener's uncanny performance as the monster, itself. His icy glares, robotic movements, and rigid costuming convey a truly believable clay creation brought to life. The exaggerated performances of Steinruck and the remaining cast members are entirely indicative of the period, displaying wide-eyed excitement, jealousy, fear, and rage with overly dramatic statements. Each of the incredible sets exhibit the same twisted Expressionist designs that would be found in the films of F.W. Murnau and other German directors of the time. A tense scene in which a young child gives the towering giant a flower would later be referenced in FRANKENSTEIN, while the picture's most stunning sequences is delivered through Loew's conjuration of Astaroth in his darkened workshop. THE GOLEM is an integral piece of film history, and an unquestionable classic among Horror aficionados which will continued to be enjoyed by many generations to follow.

This opening storyboard is incredibly frightening...

The learned Rabbi Loew
reads in the stars that
misfortune threatens
the Jews

Geez, if that's not some freaky foreshadowing.  Here's the setup--in the 16th century, the Jewish community in Prague face persecution.  Desperate for protection, the Rabbi molds a giant golem out of clay, and summons a demon to help inject life into this statue.  The scene is mesmerizing, with the Rabbi chanting his spell from within a ring of fire.  One of the greatest scenes in the history of horror cinema!

Soon everyone learns that the golem refuses to be controlled, as it wrecks havoc amongst friends and foe.  This makes a provocative statement on how violence creates more violence, and how you shouldn't mess with the laws of nature.

One interesting observation I had--the Jews were banded from the region due to rumors they practiced black magic.  I immediately connected this with gov't lies and propaganda for means to justify an end.  But when the Jews attempted to use spells for protection, it sort of validates the Emperor's beliefs, does it not?

The Golem is without a doubt an early gem in horror cinema.  It is eerie, atmospheric, and ground-breaking.  I have no idea why this has not received more acclaim.  Highly recommended to silent horror film fans.",1255132800,4,1552,5.019607843137255
707404,4,6303695841,"The Golem is an interesting story though the sets and costumes do not match the time. It is suppossed to be in 16th Century Prague but the costumes look 13th century and the entire period look is much more medieval than Renaissance. The emperor that persecuted the jews in that region then known as Bohemia, was Rudolph I (May 1218 - 15 July 1291, emperor from 1273) not Rudolph II (King of Bohemia from 1575-1608/1611) who quite the contrary, was in best of terms with the head rabbi in Prague and very interested in  the Kabalah.
The Golem is created by the rabbi to save his people. He makes a giant clay statue that becomes alive after a special incantation and he takes it with him to the castle of the emperor, where he frightens him and his court to such a degree that he consents to repeal the edict of evacuation. The scene of giving life to the Golem is the most spooky.
However an assistant to the rabbi is in love with his daughter, who is having an affair of her own with another man she likes better than him. He hears them talking in her bedchamber and revives the Golem, which sets out to destroy the intruder and throws him off the top of the tower, the whole persecution of the intruder by the Golem is the most exciting part of the film. This situation enables the rabbi's daughter to become hysterical, and scream her head off, all of which she does very well and enthuthiastically.
There is also a fire provoked by the Golem, and the whole ghetto is alarmed. The fire destroys the Tower in a beautiful, terryfying sequence, but the rabbi has a magical spell to quench the fire, which he uses right on time so the ghetto is saved.
The lighting is very well utilized in the film to create a constant air of mystery and danger. The Golem always looks fearsome and menacing and his eyes and facial expression reminded me of the sculpture that was alive in the castle of the Beast in Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"".
This film is entertaining and elegant, but also an important step in the development of German Expressionist cinema, for which I do recommend seeing it. Now I am very curious to see how it influenced ""Faust' and ""Nosferatu"".",1247443200,3,2158,4.463291139240506

707407,4,6303695841,"This unusual silent film has a number of special features which make it stand out from others, particularly in historic and artistic aspects.  While the Golem itself can be a little frightening at times and is reminiscent of the story of Frankenstein, its main features are actually the wonderful and fascinating sets.  Well-known German cast and crew (actor/director Paul Wegener and cinematographer Karl Freund) used styles common in German silent films of the 1920s, combining Gothic-like windows and houses with an overall surrealistic feeling, not unlike those used in ""The Cabinet of Caligari"".  Buildings look like something out of a fairytale - or a bad dream, more likely! - representing medieval Prague, where the legendary story of the Golem began.  Many Golem stories circulated in central Europe over the centuries, telling the sad plight of persecuted Jews who lived in ghettos of large cities because they were not accepted by the majority Christian population.  They stuck together as a community and their rabbis or leaders often practiced the Cabbala:  an ancient Hebrew system of mysticism and magic.  From this occult background a certain Rabbi makes a human figure out of clay, and using magic incantations given him by a spirit, gives life to the clay statue now called the Golem.  First used for good purposes, namely to frighten the Jews' persecutors and protect the Jewish community, the spell runs out and threatens to turn on its maker, while at the same time the Rabbi's daughter has a forbidden love affair.  All these things come together in an exciting climax with realistic action and more fascinating indoor and outdoor sets.  Close attention was also given to authentic-looking costumes of the period, and the Golem itself does indeed look like he is made of clay.  In line with German Expressionist cinema of the 1920s, the acting is at times exaggerated, but this seems to fit perfectly with the eccentric surroundings and even the fantastic story itself.

Although the restored version on the KINO label does proper justice to an important cultural film like ""The Golem"", this DVD by Alpha Video is not at all too bad for its budget price.  The picture quality is reasonably good for the most part, with only some parts a little unclear or showing too much white.  A nice Classical music recording has been used as the accompaniment, and for the most part it is actually quite suitable, but there are a few moments of awkward silence and moods which don't fit the scenes.  These minor imperfections did not detract my attention from the fascinating story itself, and I can still recommend this Alpha Video DVD to anyone who values the artistic and historic value of ""The Golem"", as well as its place in the development of the horror genre.",1219968000,4,2776,4.9654427645788335
707408,4,6303695841,"""The Golem: How He Came into The World"" (1920) is the only extant film in Paul Wegener's Golem trilogy, which was the first horror series in cinema. ""The Golem"" (1915) and ""The Golem and the Dancing Girl"" (1917) did not survive, but that doesn't matter in viewing the third film, because ""How He Came into The World"" is a prequel, not a sequel. It retells the most famous Golem story, inspired by the 16th century Jewish legend of a monster made of clay and brought to life to protect the persecuted Jews of Prague. Paul Wegener wrote, co-directed, and played the Golem himself.

The mystical Rabbi Low (Albert Steinruck), spiritual leader of the Jewish community in Prague, foresees disaster for his people. A decree from the Emperor follows shortly, accusing Jews of practicing Black Magic and ordering them evacuate the Jewish quarter. Low pursues a diplomatic solution by seeking an audience with the Emperor (Otto Gebuhr), whom he has served in the past. But he also constructs a giant creature of clay, whom he brings to life through magic to be his servant and save the Jews if necessary. Meanwhile, the Emperor's envoy Knight Florian (Lothar Muthel) is charmed by Low's daughter Miriam (Lyda Salmonova).

""The Golem"" waits until very late in the film to create tension. It doesn't get into full gear until the Golem becomes disobedient and Florian and Miriam's relationship heats up. There seems not to have been any attempt to pace the film, but it's only 86 minutes long. The sets are elaborate, both indoors and in the streets of the Jewish quarter. I found myself trying to make out the background detail during the Emperor's Rose Festival. Whatever is on that wall is fascinating. I was also impressed by the technical ability to project one film almost seamlessly into another during the same sequence.

Thematically, the story seems muddled. Although it is ultimately sympathetic to the Jews, who are the film's main characters, the gentiles' fear of them is, at least in part, justified. The Jews are accused of practicing black magic. And what does the Rabbi do but bring an uncontrollable menace to life through pagan magic? Of course, the story of the Golem is a cautionary tale and a reflection on the implications of hubris and violence. This film's ambitions are more circumscribed. We don't see enough of the Golem or know enough about the characters to get more sophisticated than a simple morality play and horror movie, but it's entertaining.

The DVD (Kino 2002): This is a restored print of the film, but there are some cracks and imperfections. The restoration was supervised in Italy, but most of the footage comes from a German print of the film held by MOMA. Additional footage and intertitles were taken from a copy held in Moscow, and some intertitles were taken from 1931 censor records. The color tints are based on an Italian print of the film. This is the widest variety in color tints I've seen in one film: green, purple, blue, salmon, pink, amber, and red. It's bright. Newly translated blue intertitles look nice. I assume the text we see for books & notices are also new, as they are in English and unblemished.

There are a few bonus features. ""Excerpts from Julien Duvivier's 1936 film 'Le Golem'"" (6 min) shows that beginning of that French film, complete with lions. ""Creation: A Comparison"" compares scenes of the monster's creation from Wegener's film with an excerpt from the novel by Chayim Bloch (text) and with the scene in which Faust summons Mephisto in F.W. Murnau's ""Faust"". There is also a Gallery of Photos and Artwork containing 16 movie stills and related illustrations.",1209945600,9,3631,4.868932038834951

The Jewish rabbi uses ""black magic"" to bring a clay statue to life in order to protect them from the Christian emperor.

The golem's straight-legged walk and padded chest will certainly look familiar, as will some of the scenes (including the monster and child). Other parts are less familiar but even more intriguing, including the celebration of European Jewish traditions going back to the 1600s.

The cover of this DVD is garishly colorized - don't worry, the movie itself has not suffered that fate. On the other hand, it hasn't gotten the kind of restoration that has brought other old movies to new life, either. As a result, brightness varies moment to moment and the edges of the screen are generally quite murky. The instrumental sound track adds to the movie, but adds only a little. Also, the movie runs a bit past the 85 minutes quoted on the cover.

Only the image quality is a real concern, though. The movie is still legible and enjoyable, but would be easier to enjoy if the imagery could be renewed using modern techniques.

707411,5,6303695841,"Set in sixteenth-century Prague, THE GOLEM is a classic silent film based upon a relatively well-known Jewish legend. Even though the Jews of Prague have peacefully lived among the other residents of the city, they have been segregated and live in a separate community ghettoized from the rest of the city. Evil courtiers convince the Emperor to issue an edict that will expel the Jews from the city completely. In an attempt to save his people, a learned rabbi, Rabbi Loew (Albert Steinruck) uses his learning of ancient and mystical arts to create a giant clay creature, the Golem, that is brought to life. He creates the creature in order to save his people by bringing the Golem to the Emperor to perform. However, the creature is brought to life with a warning that it will become evil if brought to life again. The rabbi's assistant, resurrects the creature in an attempt to kidnap the rabbi's daughter, who he loves. Instead, the creature begins a rampage of destruction that is stopped when the Golem meets a young girl.

The story of THE GOLEM has been around for centuries and is a good one (this version of the story was even filmed once before). Story aside, the most memorable things about THE GOLEM are the visualizations and cinematography. The images in the film (even if you see the film in a poor quality transfer) are stunning. THE GOLEM is a film that once you see it, you will remember images from it for a lifetime.

Besides just being a quality silent film, THE GOLEM is notable for two reasons. Cinematically, the film had a huge impact upon many later filmmakers, especially James Whale who paid homage to the film in many of his key scenes in FRANKENSTEIN.

The second major reason the film is notable is because of the eerie historical foreshadowing it had. The film was released in 1920 and portrays Jews in a positive light. However, the Jewish people in the film are persecuted, are forced to live in a ghetto, and have their livelihoods threatened. The oppression of the Jews in the film is quite similar to the oppression the Jews faced in Germany just prior to the rise of the Third Reich.

THE GOLEM is a film that any student of cinema should see at least once and is a movie that fans of silent films will probably adore.",1180310400,,2257,4.606965174129353

707553,4,6303695841,"Based on a legend that began in 1580 Prague, this early example of German Expressionism is also a fine example of an early horror movie.  The lighting and shadows, Gothic/Expressionist surroundings, the dark forces swirling around, and the creepy-looking Golem all contribute towards making this a landmark film.  It's set in the abovementioned 16th century Prague, in the Jewish ghetto of the city (one can see the pointed hats and the strange-looking badges a number of the characters are wearing, a common practice in many areas of Europe prior to the Enlightenment and something the Nazis, 15 or so years down the line, only had to look back in history for).  The much-revered rabbi-astrologer of the ghetto, Rabbi Lw, in his desperation to stop an anti-Semitic royal edict forcing the community out of the city, begins making a man out of clay, and with the help of his assistant conjures up Astaroth, who gives them the magick word that will bring the Golem to life when written down and put in the amulet on his chest.

Rabbi Lw, who has successfully done a horoscope for the emperor in the past, is invited to his court again to entertain the more fortunate people who don't have to live in a ghetto and who look all fresh, sunshiny, and happy, a far cry from the people in the ghetto, who are almost all old, dressed in black, poor, and beaten-down looking.  While the rabbi is at court with the Golem, who is being passed off as his mute servant, his daughter Miriam is getting busy with the rather feminine-looking Knight Florian, who delivered first the banishment edict and then the edict demanding Rabbi Lw appear at court.  (Florian is actually more feminine-looking than Miriam!)  All is going well at court till everyone, against his explicit warning, starts laughing at the images of his ancestors he's conjured up, and the building starts collapsing.  However, after the Golem saves the day, the banishment edict is reversed, and all seems to be going well.  After they get home, he turns on his master and is deactivated; conveniently, a bad astrological portent has just begun, in which the Golem will be compelled to turn against his creator.  Rabbi Lw is about to destroy him when his servant summons him to the synagogue to lead the thanksgiving prayers for the edict having been reversed.  Not knowing that the Golem has just become anything but a protector and benefactor, the servant reactivates him, and all while Florian is still in Miriam's room, both of them desperately trying to figure out a way get him out of there without anyone finding out what just happened.  At this point the Golem totally goes berserk, and things are not happening according to plan for anyone as he goes on a rampage through the ghetto.  (I just wish his rampage had lasted longer; it would have made for a lot more dramatic tension!)

It's kind of stunning to realise just how close this film was made to the rise of the Nazis, what with its rather fair and sympathetic portrayal of the Jewish characters.  These characters might be poor, living in a ghetto, and made to wear distinguishing badges and hats, but they seem like more sympathetic and human characters than the Christian Czechs, who party, frolic, and flirt all day long, not having any more important priorities, like survival or dignity in the face of prejudice and blood libels.  Although it does seem kind of ironic how one of the charges on the banishment edict is the practice of witchcraft and black magick, which Rabbi Lw uses in order to try to save his people!  Even the inaccuracies weren't offensive, more like unintentional errors from someone well-meaning and who didn't know any better, such as references to praying in temple (that word was not used to describe a Jewish house of worship, bar the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, till the 19th century, and this takes place in 1580!) and using the name Jehovah to refer to God.  No observant Jew, past or present, would ever use that word, which is the result of a 16th century Christian scribal error, not the way the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, was pronounced.  (No one has known the correct pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton for nearly 2,000 years anyway.)  Still, all things considered, those are relatively minor errors; it's not like these characters are big-nosed money-grubbing Shylocks.

Extras are excerpts from Julien Duvivier's 'Le Golem' (1936), comparisons of the creations found in the film and in Chayim Bloch's novel, as well as a comparison with the scene in 'Faust' (1926) where Mephisto is conjured up, and a gallery of pictures and artwork.

This perhaps isn't the best choice for a first silent (some of the characters do have the exaggerated makeup and eyes that a lot of people falsely assume was the case in all silents, although this is 1920 and not 1926 or 1928, by which time actors looked more natural and less heavily made-up for the bright lights), but it is a classic Expressionist film, as well as a classic silent horror film and a classic early German film.",1163376000,6,5020,4.792584009269988

I'm just here to talk about the movie, and how it looks some eighty-five years after its creation.

I'm not a big fan, usually, of the special-effects extravaganza. This is no exception; rarely will you find a review of this film, contemporary or modern, that does not almost squeal with amazement over its special effects. And, for what it's worth, they're pretty nifty, especially for 1920. But special effects do not a movie make, or Men in Black II would have actually been worth watching. What makes the film visually arresting is the more subtle set construction-- the ghetto itself, with its narrow, twisting streets and constant activity.

The story itself, the precursor of the Frankenstein story, is relatively simple: Rabbi Low (Albert Steinruck) foresees, in the stars, disaster for the Jews if the world continues on its present course. After consulting with the rest of the ghetto's leadership, he and his assistant construct the Golem (played by Wegener himself), a clay homunculus designed to protect the Jews. Everything is going along swimmingly, with the Golem winning a pardon for Low's people from the Emperor, whom the Golem saves from a collapsing building. Its work done, Low sends its soul back to the nether regions whence it came, but his assistant has other plans...

Much of the interest of the modern film fan, in watching silent movies, comes from seeing how things were done back then as opposed to how they're doing now. Watching Murnau's films is even more fun, for example, when you realize he invented the tracking shot in order to get some of the scenes down in Nosferatu. It's the rare silent film that's going to hold the modern film viewer's attention. (This is not to say those films aren't good in their own right, but that the attention span of modern man is not what it once was.) From that perspective, it's hard to recommend The Golem as more than a vertical-market curiosity; this is going to take too much attention for most modern filmgoers. Those willing to put in the added effort may find it worthwhile, but it still seems oddly empty in some way; I cannot help but think, however, that this comes from the fact that those of us watching it now cannot do so without divorcing what we know about the Jews and their treatment in Germany from the events of World War II (which, obviously, this film predates).

This supreme golden of the expressionist Cinema was another return to the mythic core to express with astonishing clarity the dense and dark clouds that soared over the German Republic just before the end of WW!.

If you realize the solid structure of the script, it will not be to think about Frankenstein as a simple variation of the luxuriant tree.

Architect Hans Poelzig was commissioned to design the sets of a medieval ghetto modeled in clay miniatures. The impressive labyrinthian set of gabeled buildings, portals and foundations ranks to the immortality status this masterpiece.",1135123200,3,804,5.030075187969925
707557,5,6303695841,"I first saw The Golem when I was 12 and have loved it ever since.  At the time I had to go to the public library, and borrow an actual film reel, and watch it inside their film vault, because this was not only before the DVD, but even before the VCR became so prevalent.  I've always been a fan of the old Univeral studio horror movies, and I wanted to see how The Golem might have influenced Frankenstein.  I found that the costume and makeup may have been influential, but little else, other than minor plot points.  The key to the Frankenstein film was that the monster became murderous because of a damaged brain, and in the source novel because he was tormented by society.  It's questionable whether a clay statue even has a brain to damage, and he certainly wasn't tormented.  As he did his daily chores around the village, people seemed to be used to his presence.  So there was no torchlit chase scene to cap the movie either.

The Golem's costume with its padded up bulk, although Paul Wegener was a big man already, and his huge boots, clearly were echoed in Frankenstein.  Some photos of Hamilton Deane in the Peggy Webling play Frankenstein (that the movie was based on) suggested a makeup inspired by The Golem.  However, some of the appearance, especially the built up forehead, seemed to be already present in Thomas Edison's 1910 version of Frankenstein, with Charles Ogle.  Edward Van Sloan compared Bela Lugosi's monster makeup, in a test reel for the part of the monster, as being very much like the Golem.  Lugosi was described as having a polished clay-like skin and broad wig that made his head a bit large.  Since Lugosi designed much of his own makeup with Jack Pierce's help, Pierce's claim about all the research he did for Karloff's make-up sounds like hot-air.  Although there are no pictures of Lugosi's makeup, it sounds like all Pierce did was give the monster a haircut, and put in the electrodes and stitches the script called for.

The only other places where one might see a similarity between The Golem and Frankenstein was in the scenes between the monster and girls.  The Golem fell for Rabbi Lowe's grown daughter, and was destroyed by a little girl named Maria.  Karloff's monster seemed to be always eloping by force, and of course he killed a little girl named Maria.  The Rabbi had an assistant, but Frankenstein worked alone in the novel, but had an assistant named Fritz in the movie, a character that appeared in some form in the play, which is unfortunately now out of print.  Of course most people remember the assistant's name as Ygor now, because of the broken necked shepherd Bela Lugosi played in The Son of Frankenstein and The Ghost of Frankenstein.

Although there are legends about Rabbi Lowe and his Golem, only the Rabbi is historical, and some Golem legends made another Rabbi the creator.  But nevertheless the movie is good historical spectacle, and moves remarkably fast for a silent movie.",1122595200,8,2953,4.695145631067962
707558,5,6303695841,"This 1921 version of ""The Golem"" (""Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam"") is a remake of a 1915 silent film. In both the Golem is played by Paul Wegener, who also played the title character in the 1917 ""The Golem and the Dancing Girl"" (""Der Golem und die Tnzerin""). The Jewish legend of the goldem is set this time around in 16th century Prague, which is supposedly when Rabbi Loew (Albert Steinrck) created the giant golem from clay to defend the Jews from the persecution by the local despot. However, the rabbi's assistant, Famulus (Ernst Deutsch) takes control of the golem and sends it forth to do his nefarious bidding, which includes abducting the beautiful Miriam (Lyda Salmonova), the Rabbi's beloved daughter. However, the Golem's will can not be perverted in such a manner. Much is made of ""The Golem"" being one of the first monster movies, and certainly this film incorporates a lot of elements that would become basic components of a lot of classic horror films. But I think ""The Golem"" deserves to be considered the first superhero film. After all, the creature was not created to be a monster, but to be a heroic figure of deliverance, and I would suggest that is the more important reading of the film in the long run.

None of this detracts from the point that ""The Golem"" is a classic silent monster movie, that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with ""Nosferatu"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera."" I would agree that ""The Golem"" is a lesser example of German expressionism; certainly it is not as textbook as ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (but then, what is?). Certainly Wegner, his figure esconced in ""clay,"" is not capable of over emoting in any way. This leads me to another comment: Granted, there are strong similarities between the Golem and Karloff's performance in ""Frankenstein"" and it would not be surprising if Karloff had seen this silent film. But I would like to point out that the shuffling movements of both performances are logical consequences of being either a figure made out of clay or reanimated dead body parts. Karloff was a fine enough actor to have figured this out, even without the inspiration offered by this film.

Ultimately, I am more concerned over the attempts to make a political reading of the film, premised on the fact that this is a German film (read ""proto-Nazi""). In terms of the film this idea is premised on the contrast between the shabby, dark-haired children of the Jewish ghetto shown throughout most of the film with the happy, blonde-haired children that surround the Golem at the end. For the latter, of course, there is a temptation to read the children as being Aryan and to comment on the irony of the impending Holocaust given such the visual oxymoron. But the simpler explanation to me is the contrast between the dark and the light as reflecting the oppressive Dionysian part of the film with its happier Apollian conclusion. Besides, I would have a hard time arguing a film where the main characters are Jewish can be rightly characterized as Anti-Semetic. The film employs stereotypes, but that was a cultural commonplace that extended beyond Jews at that time in popular culture (cf. the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs). Certainly the Emperor Luhois (Otto Gebhr) is a stereotypical despot.

There are lots of ways of reading ""The Golem,"" so in the final analysis the important thing would be that you see it for yourself and make up your own mind on these issues. I think that however you read this film, it will end up high on your list for silent films in this genre.",1113436800,2,3550,4.713365539452496
707559,4,6303695841,"Although this 1920 German silent does not really rank alongside the truly great silent films, it remains a fascinating oddity. Based on European Jewish folklore, it tells the story a Jewish community in Prague which is threatened with explusion from the city. In an effort to protect his people, Rabbi Loew creates a man-like creature made of clay and uses it to impress the Emperor. Unfortunately, the magic backfires, and when the Golem falls into the hands of the Rabbi's perfidious assistant disaster results.

Much of the film's charm is in its visual style. The sets by Hans Poelzig are a strange but cohesive mixture of mediaeval, nouveau, and surrealism, and the cinematography by legendary photography Karl Freund uses high contrast black and white to truly remarkable effect. The Poelzig-Freund combition would cast an extremely long shadow, and THE GOLEM would influence not only such German films as Fitz Lang's METROPOLIS but the entire cycle of 1930s American horror films that began with the 1931 Bela Lugosi DRACULA.

Several plot devices and the look of the Golem, as played by Paul Wegener, would also prove particularly influential for director James Whale's famous 1932 FRANKENSTEIN. Whether or not Boris Karloff or make-up artist Jack Pierce knew the film is uncertain--but Whale, who was fond of German cinema, certainly did, and traces of THE GOLEM can be seen throughout his most famous works.

Over the past several decades a number of film historians have attempted to reinterpret THE GOLEM in light of the Holocaust. There may actually be a certain validity to this, for although the Jews are portrayed sympathetically they are very clearly outsiders, and their religion seems less like religion than witchcraft--and indeed Rabbi Loew might be said to practice black magic in bringing the Golem to life. This sense of social estrangement and religious stigmatism does seem indicative of the antisemitism that will ultimately explode into furnaces of Nazi Germany. All the same, it is worth noting that THE GOLEM is a fundamentally Jewish story to begin with, and it is perhaps best to think of it in those terms instead of using hindsight to impose modern meanings upon the film.

There are several home market releases of the film. While I have not seen it, I am told the Timeless Studios VHS release is weak; I have, however, seen the Gotham DVD release, and although there are some quality issues this inexpensive DVD is not at all bad. Still, my preference and recommendation is the Kino DVD. Unlike many Kino editions, it does not have anything significant in the way of bonuses, but the overall presentation is very fine and likely represents a best-possible presentation short of full digital restoration.

707560,5,6303695841,"""The Golem"" (1920 - 85 minutes), a mute film photographed in black & white, was written and directed by Paul Wegener that also was the star of this classic movie of the German Expressionism. Golem is a clay being -  a myth of a Jewish medieval legend - that gains life when Loew, a rabbi and astronomer of Prague, in the XIV century, finds a magical formula in an old book of Cabala. One of the most relevant moment in the film is when the  clay ""monster"", created to protect the Jews against anti-semitic attacks, manifests affective feelings for a little girl. Paul Wegener had taken for two times the myth of the Golem to the cinema, and this movie was the most beautiful form. More recently, the legend of the Golem was rewrite by two great authors: Isaac Bashevis Singer, that published the book ""The Golem"" in 1982, and Elie Wiesel, that also wrote a book with the same heading. ""The Golem"" have influenced many Hollywood productions and certainly will inspire other writers of future generations.

707561,4,6303695841,"In considering silent films to be shown in our church sanctuary accompanied by pipe organ, I recommended this film because of the weighty issues it exposes.  The ""Frankenstein"" theme--humankind's limitations in controlling life we create--is more relevant today than in 16th century Prague or 19th century England.  Genetic manipulation brings forth moral, ethical, and religious questions.  But there is much more to ""Der Golem"".

One of the fascinating subtleties of this film is the use of symbolic imagery.  For instance, note that the six-pointed Star of David is used when religious practices are depicted and five-pointed stars are used for occult practices.  The Burtonesque structures that seem on the verge of keeling over imbue the ghetto with a vague sense of unease and disjointedness that mirrors the social disconnectedness of the golem.  Themes of redemption, purity, reconciliation, and childlike belief are evident.  I was also impressed by the respectful treatment of the Jews and their religious practices in this film.

The intensely emotional expressions in the clay face of the golem  convincingly portray the wrenching and rending of the fabric of a personality that longs to live and move among humans and will never be able to do so.  The golem is never portrayed as evil himself, but rather as the product of, in modern terms, bad genes and emotional deprivation.  I do not consider this to be a true horror film, because I think it was intended, through the portrait of a ""lost soul"", to cause viewers examine their own perceptions of themselves and others.

I orignally gave four stars because of the lousy score in the Gotham Distribution release, which is a ten- or fifteen-minute loop of music that is totally inappropriate to the scenarios.  I have since purchased the Kino release and found the score to be sensitive to the emotional breadth of the movie and evocative of Jewish ghetto life, the frivolity of the court, and nuances of scene through use of musical motifs.
