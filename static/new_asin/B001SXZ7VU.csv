3787624,3,B001SXZ7VU,"The genealogy of Jesus is something you can access pretty much anywhere, just look online.  But this DVD presents good, solid research without huge leaps in logic, and it presents it in an entertaining, neat form.  The expert on the subject is trustworthy, not just some nut on the internet.  I feel like I gained a lot from this film.",1356652800,,335,4.55
3787625,1,B001SXZ7VU,This is not a documentary on the God Kings Book. It starts talking with the author and not very well shot because most of the time the camera isn't on the guys face when he is speaking. Then it goes into a blurb about the real documentary and after that it handles other documentaries that the guy made. It ends with a supposed snipit of a TV show that was made by him and aired?,1349481600,,379,4.066666666666666
3787626,1,B001SXZ7VU,"the subject manner is interesting ,how then I ask, does  a wordy proffesor lose the interest of the faithful? by painfully breaking down to the  nanometer(I don't believe thats a true quantity) information that is subjective at best... that's how .",1340409600,,248,5.024390243902439
3787627,4,B001SXZ7VU,Dr. Hugh Montgomery seems to know genealogy and he presents his research very well in this documentary. It's interesting to consider who the descendants of Jesus might be and Dr. Montgomery seems to have traced Jesus' family tree quite thoroughly with branches extending from the Vikings all the way to George Washington.  I wasn't too impressed with the production quality of the film and I was initially a little skeptical about the topic. Dr. Montgomery proved to be very convincing and I encourage anyone with an interest in genealogy and spirituality to take a look at this documentary.,1294272000,7,591,5.030612244897959
3787628,3,B001SXZ7VU,"I enjoy genealogy and have traced my family roots back to the 1700's and am still working on going back even further.  God Kings: The Descendants Of Jesus was really interesting, whether you're a fan of genealogy, history, or Jesus.  Hugh Montgomery, a retired professor, talks about his work with tracing the lineage of Jesus back through the Norman Conquest.  Like myself, Professor Montgomery enjoys genealogy and became interested in tracing Jesus's descendants when he was exploring his own family tree.  In this film the theory is that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and their descendants live to this day. The whole lineage is explained clearly and, true or not, is interesting nonetheless.  In fact, Professor Montgomery believes that his family is also a distant relative of Jesus! Good film with a lot of information to think about.",1288483200,6,847,5.0647482014388485
3787629,4,B001SXZ7VU,"""The Descendents of Jesus traced through the Odonic and Davidic Dynasties"" is the second title of this DVD, which sums it up nicely.

If you've seen The DaVinci Code or read the book, or any of the literature that book was based on, you're familiar with this material.  The theory is that Jesus was married (in this DVD, to Mary Magdalene) and his descendents live even today.  This DVD is basically an extended interview with Professor Hugh Montgomery, whose research into the genealogy of Jesus is deep and extensive, and he explains it well.  As the Tom Hanks of this version, he's believable and compelling, spinning a fascinating mystery.  He connects Jesus to the Vikings, and the most powerful royal families in European history, including within the Vatican itself.  And George Washington was related to Jesus!  Of course, the Montgomery family itself (so says the professor) is also related to Jesus.  Unfortunately, some of the evidence for this is in documents by the families themselves, which only proves those powerful people had a lot of gall, but doesn't actually prove the fact.  Great material, well told.",1276214400,4,1123,4.994623655913978
3787630,3,B001SXZ7VU,"Once again Philip Gardner has managed to ruin a perfectly good idea by making a crappy, low budget movie with the worst sound quality I have ever heard in my life. It even made my brand new flat screen sound staticy, with that being said this has no bearing at all on the author Hugh Montgomery's work and I give Hugh Montgomery a 10 and a bravo! As far as philip garder and his reality productions go, he needs to find a new career or a new sound man. And He needs to turn down the loud background music so you can hear the author speak.",1261958400,6,538,4.084905660377358
3787631,3,B001SXZ7VU,"This is pretty interesting from a historical and religious perspective. Retired Belgrade Prof. Of Applied Sciences, Hugh Montgomery talks with Philip Gardiner about the process of tracing the lineage of Jesus back through the Norman Conquest, and how he personally became interested in the subject when he was doing his own family's genealogy.",1252368000,2,343,5.490566037735849
8340201,2,B001SXZ7VU,"Unfortunately DNA says otherwise regarding the Vikings, the Goths, the Germanic people vs people from Sumerian, now modern day Iraq.

I don't doubt,that travels out Sumeria would have occured, but to make the genetic leap that mostly E1b people became I1/r1b l48/r1a people is not science,",1481414400,,289,5.282608695652174

8340204,5,B001SXZ7VU,"This is one of my favorite Gardiner interview films. Dr. Hugh Montgomery makes an intriguing argument regarding who Jesus really was and how he became someone who he really never was, as Rome took over Christianity. There are a few sentences that I can't quite make out - absolutely nothing to do with the music mix. And there was a couple places where the citation got skipped.  ~~  I absolutely love what Gardiner and company do with the music mix-down in the videos they make. I think it's a fresh perspective that sort of constitutes a new art-form; mixing music and esoteric information and animation. I find it very entertaining and relaxing.",1430265600,,648,4.776785714285714

8340207,5,B001SXZ7VU,"Many will refute the information given because of the knee jerk reaction to their so called faith foundation. What this documentary poses does not dispute any of the belief systems but the fact that it isn't quite what you thought it was. BRAIN WASHING as he states toward the end of the document is exactly what has happened. I won't dispute certain faith based belief's but I will say the story isn't quite what everyone thinks it is. History is written by the winners. Think about it long and hard. The bible is a book written by a winner.

As far as the truth..this may or may not be uncovered. My guess is that those on the fringes, like this documentary, will be kept in the closet because uncovering the truth would mean a large portion of the world would have to think for themselves and find the truth. This would be too hard to admit the story is not quite what everyone believes.",1391299200,,890,4.426829268292683
8340208,4,B001SXZ7VU,"The Jesus/Odin connection was too bizarre for me to resist, so I purchased. I can't believe how convincing this argument is!! The amount of actual research, no great leaps in logic, it was so much more professional and scholarly than a lot of bloodline theories. I was so pleasantly surprised. These people are clearly experts who have spent years researching the subject.",1374883200,,372,5.016129032258065
8340209,5,B001SXZ7VU,I guess the way I would describe this dvd is a breakdown of the family tree of Jesus. That's pretty heady and amazing stuff I think most people would agree. Great value and a fine addition to my collection of historical and religious study dvds.,1374883200,,245,4.466666666666667
8340210,4,B001SXZ7VU,To those familiar with the DaVinci Code the material here will be of great interest. If you are an open minded individual I'm sure you will like this movie like I did.,1359676800,,167,4.25
