8098859,3,B000CFX7BM,"I bought this after seeing program clips on You Tube.  Apparently the video was made from prior year programs, as the actors on this DVD are different from the current cast.  Some of the gags are quite well done, while others are kind of blah.  I guess what one considers funny varies from person to person.  Toward the end of the DVD, there are some gags featuring full nudity, if that makes a difference on whether or not you want to purchase this collection.  After having seen it, would I buy it again?  I really don't know----",1424390400,,531,4.422680412371134
8098860,4,B000CFX7BM,"First, it says 2 disks but there is only one.  No problem, there's still ~180 minutes as they state.

Second and more importantly, be warned that while the first 50% of the DVD is great for family watching, but after that it switches suddenly to Rated R.  During the first 50%, there are some great gags that kids would get a good laugh at.  In fact my favorite gag in the whole DVD is when they have a guy hide out at a day care center with a laser pointer and you get to watch the kids chase the light around on the carpet or try to get it off of their clothes like it's a stain or maybe a bug.  VERY funny and so cute.

At the 50% mark it starts getting a little more graphic, mostly inappropriate-for-kids scenes (including public displays of affection but with sexual overtones or heavy petting, no actual nudity - and some vulgar scenes like a woman at a urinal ""missing"" it to the shock of men at urinals beside her).

But after the 75% mark....every single scene contains nudity.  Mostly female, full frontal and full backside shots, but several visual phallic references as well.  I was pretty shocked, having no clue about this and also having read the other review here that said it was great for the family to watch (perhaps they didn't watch the whole thing?).  There are several gags that include public sex as well.

Overall, since I'm not offended by those things, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars for being pretty funny.  There were only a couple of gags that I didn't laugh at least a few times during it.  All of them have a shock factor built in as well.

Everyone should also know that there's no talking in this DVD either - it's all silly music and sound effects - and if you hear actual words it's clearly dubbed in stuff that the actors (or gag victims) are not saying themselves.  That starts off a little annoying but you actually get used to it pretty fast.  This is what makes this a universal DVD since there are no languages to be concerned with.

If you're not offended by nudity and want a good laugh, it's certainly worth the under-$10 I paid for it.
