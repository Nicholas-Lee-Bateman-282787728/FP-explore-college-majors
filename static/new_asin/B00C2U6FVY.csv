8576830,5,B00C2U6FVY,Great movie tila was stunning and the movie was definitely action packed,1486944000,,72,5.083333333333333
8576831,1,B00C2U6FVY,"2012 (not 2017 amazon!) crime drama. Gangster steals from other crooked thugs, but is double-crossed by his girlfriend he uses as bait. Very poor film that went direct to DVD film starring Tila ""Tequila"" Nguyen, Nick Hogan, and Tray Chaney directed by David Keary.
Foul language, no nudity. Do not confuse this garbage with the 2016 comedy film, Masterminds, of the same name.",1486080000,3,376,4.984126984126984

8576833,1,B00C2U6FVY,"Rocket (Tray Chaney) owns a club has a nickname and robs people because that is apparently what he does. He uses high tech GPS, cameras, and his girlfriend (Tila Tequila) to accomplish this task. The writing and acting is downright bad. This is one of the worst thug films made without 50 cents. The camera and sound were bad too. The writing had too many trite sayings. ""You feel me man."" My Bad."" ""Taking care of my business.""  ""Quit trippin'""

The credits were bad too as they seemed to be designed to let us know all black people have nicknames in quotation marks. David"" Cowboy"" Keary is responsible for this disaster of a movie, a name I will avoid in the future.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Implied sex with groping. Major league legs and cleavage.",1385769600,6,763,4.595588235294118
