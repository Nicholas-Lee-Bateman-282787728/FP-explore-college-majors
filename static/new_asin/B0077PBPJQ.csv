8511893,5,B0077PBPJQ,I wasn't sure I would like the animation of these stories...but it is so well done to coincide with the stories that they seem like our own family stories...the stories themselves are priceless and this dvd is too,1393545600,,213,4.631578947368421
8511894,5,B0077PBPJQ,I purchased this to use for my teaching in end-of-life care.  Each story is an animated story that a person has shared with a family member.  The use of doing life review in end-of-life is valuable and can spur many feelings.  These shorts will help to encourage the conversation.  I am looking forward to my first use of this.,1370131200,3,327,4.491525423728813
8511895,5,B0077PBPJQ,"I always find myself glued to the radio on Friday mornings eagerly awaiting the week's installment of StoryCorp, filled with a sense of wonder and knowing that they be sharing another gem that will leave me teary eyed and thankful for the blessings in my life.  So you can imagine my delight at finding this collection of highlights.  I highly recommend watching and listening to these powerful and real (in every sense of the word) stories.",1336003200,2,441,4.7894736842105265
8511896,3,B0077PBPJQ,"This is an oddball DVD from PBS that will probably appeal most to those who follow the StoryCorps series on NPR. The StoryCorps project was started by former documentary filmmaker Dave Isay in 2003. The original ""recording booth"" was set up in Grand Central Station in NYC and people could come in as a duo and one person would interview the other for 40 minutes. There was a facilitator with them. Then they send out StoryCorps vans around the country to make it available to all. To date 30,000 interviews have been recorded by 60,000 people.

In 2010 one of the SC facilitators told Isay that he and his brother (the Rauch Brothers) were animated film makers and they showed him a sample of a 3-minute animation they did to the actual recording of an interview. Isay loved the idea and ordered a series of five shorts to be aired on PBS on the P.O.V. documentary series. This DVD collects those five, plus five more for the 30-minute running time of the main feature.

As I said the animated shorts are based on 3-minute excerpts for the stories being told and quite a few are sad with death involved, either through cancer or, in the case of three of them the bombing of the Twin Towers on 9/11/2001. In fact two are about different employees of the Cantor Fitzgerald - the investment firm that had offices on the top floor. One of the other stories deals with an African American family and another - only funny one about an Asian American mother.

The bonuses are actually longer than the ""feature"" and are ""odd"" as well. First there is a 24-minute interview with Isay that is really ""raw footage"". First he has to turn off his cell phone and they even stop in the middle of the questions to have him have his nose powdered to stop the glare. Yes, we see the makeup person doing this. Very strange!  Then come what are described as ""1st, 2nd and 3rd takes"" of ""Excerpts"" interviews with the two Rauch brothers. One lasts 3 minutes while the other two total 31 minutes. This too is ""raw footage"" with one microphone being much louder than the other. I admit that you do get a lot of information about the project and the animators' career and methods, but I'm not sure what the original purpose of these interviews were.

So this gets an ""ok"" from me. It was fine - and I ""felt"" the stories, though I'm not sure the images made the voices more listenable.

One last thing; the animations have text at the beginning of the stories and the color contrast was so low that I literally had to move close to my TV screen to read the words.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
