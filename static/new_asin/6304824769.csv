There are three DVD discs total in the collection...I tend to watch discs 1 & 2 more than disc 3, only because the stuff on disc 3 starts to look like 80's ""Inspector Gadget""...it's still a good collection to check out, well worth the money...if you like Dirty Pair, check out the ""Kurumi"" and ""Kiddy Grade"" series also...",1104537600,,484,4.377777777777778

2558658,5,6304824769,"I have recently seen every Flash episode on Showtime Beyond and to put it simply, most all of the episodes revolve around the same themes.  Kei and Yuri find themselves in a pickle time after time again, whether it be in their search for the infamous Flair or Yuri's endless search for the right guy.  For those who know nothing of this series yet are eyeballing it as a possible buy, I have but a few things to say.  First and foremost the name Dirty Pair is not a pun for endless sex scenes.  Though there is nudity in some of the episodes in shower scenes, there is no sex whatsoever in any of the episodes.  Secondly, this series has a few flaws with the dubbing which make it annoying at times and hard to bear with, especially whenever something intense is happening.  The anime mainly has a light-hearted tone and is not meant to be taken very seriously. Also, the animation is a bit aged and some of the effects (i.e. explosions, gunshots, etc.) aren't that admirable. But if you can look past that Dirty Pair will not leave you disappointed. For those looking for hentai with loads of eye candy, this isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a comedy with action and an interesting storyline, the endless antics and bloopers of Kei and Yuri will undoubtedly keep you interested from start to finish.",1072224000,,1313,4.518987341772152
2558659,4,6304824769,"There are these two compaines that are like at war, 3WA and GCN. They are like very mortal enemies and are at war, and the 3WA they need to hire some people for fighting. So they are looking at Kei and Yuri's appications and  they are in to 3WA now. Yuri is walking to go out for a date and Kei was  walking by too. A man goes up to Yuri and gives her a card to give to the  3WA before the men after the card get thier hands on it. So it's up to Kei  and Yuri to get the card to 3WA safely.",954633600,,490,3.5943396226415096

8119904,5,6304824769,"The funniest butch/femme duo in action comedy, Kei and Yuri -- ""fearless, ruthless, and completely clueless"" -- are the reasons I never get tired of watching these episodes. This mid-90s reboot of the 1987-88 series has no shortage of murderous mecha, loli assassins, galactic crimelords, and other nuisances, but besides featuring cheesecake galore, it makes Kei a more sexually ambiguous figure than before, which gives the whole series a different vibe from its predecessor.

Note that DIRTY PAIR FLASH is an animated teen comedy that's laugh out loud funny despite the ridiculously high body count; how can you resist a team of pulchritudinous super cops whose mantra is ""but it wasn't our fault!""?. The series doesn't come to a proper ending, it just stops. Sure is one hell of an entertaining ride, though.",1411516800,,812,5.105263157894737
8119905,4,6304824769,"Yuri and Kei are trouble consultants, aka detectives. They travel the galaxy solving all sorts of crimes. They are both very entertaining characters. Kei is a tomboy and she's actually a pretty competent detective for the most part. Yuri however is a fluff-head who's more concerned about getting a date than working. This anime is an action/comedy with plenty of fan service.

Dirty pair was one of the first anime series I bought back in the late 90's and even tough it's quite dated, it's a whole lot of fun. There's nothing deep about this anime, but the fun factor is high enough to not require much of a story. I think this anime is a good price and would recommend it to any serious anime fan. If you're not an otaku you may want to watch it on youtube or something before u buy. There are plenty of way better animes out there, but Dirty Pair is a lot of fun. There was also a movie called Project Eden. I would avoid it.",1350086400,,929,4.339080459770115
8119906,5,6304824769,this anime is really funny and energetic.  It was an anime I seen as a kid and wanted to have for my own.,1331856000,,105,3.5652173913043477

8119910,4,6304824769,"It's interesting to see an anime show named ""Dirty Pair"" to get more guys to buy the dvd having them think they'll see some naughty girls, this show does have brief nudity but nothing sexually. It's just two special agent girls name Kei & Yuri who can't never get along like any childish dram queen little girl but anyway when it come to business they always work together. This collection has 3 dics the third dics I guess the Japanese back then were inspired by our American cartoon ""Inspecture Gadget"".",1119225600,,505,4.622222222222222
8119911,3,6304824769,"Dirty Pair Flash is the new adventures of two girls codenamed ""Lovely Angels"", Kei is a red-haired tomboy with and Yuri is a cutey who also angers easily. Both girls argue and fight through most of the series, but they made it so funny. This is the only time I've enjoyed characters bickering at each other. They work as trouble consultants deal with assassins, killer robots, valuable debit card and a crazy man that wants to conquer the universe. The Lovely Angels, have a nack for causing tons of damage and destruction; wrecking neighborhoods, airports, spacestations, large yaht and even a whole city!

The first five episodes of the series are fantastic packed with action and witty dialog, but the rest of the series slows down alot and gets dull. It's like they decided that the series was too violent and toned down the action drastically. The artwork and animation looks dated (like old school), but the sound effects, music and voice-acting are all excellent. I really enjoyed the beginning of the series, but later it got boring as the action was toned down. Okay for teens, has 16 episodes total.",1107648000,,1109,4.806282722513089
