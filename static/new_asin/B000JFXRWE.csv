2670486,5,B000JFXRWE,"Wow, this movie was great. I borrowed it from a friend and finally watched it a week later. Sometimes the movie you keep putting off to watch turns out to be better than you thought. This was one of them. I could watch it everyday. I wish I could find the soundtrack cause all the songs were fun. The music numbers were exciting and the storyline and acting were strong, i mean, how many movies star a pre-op transsexual woman?  Highly recommend.",1254268800,7,446,4.439024390243903
2670487,5,B000JFXRWE,"I was already intrigued witin the elements involved in the production, but I enjoyed it even more, when I actual seen the whole movie. I have a new found respect for particular director, and their vision. It's very energetice, and bursting with life. Also, it shares with ppl who are living outisde of the glbt community, it introduces glbt ppl in a nu light. I loved it.",1233964800,,371,4.552238805970149
2670488,4,B000JFXRWE,"It is a funny story of a pre-operated transverstite, whose dream fulfilment had destroyed a very target of her deeds, which was a quest for soul mate and family relations.",1218585600,,171,4.733333333333333
2670489,4,B000JFXRWE,"I am not prudish.
(But I am glad I watched this film by myself. And, unless you are comfortable in company hearing ""pecker"" and ""pussy"" and, in company, viewing anal sex and ejaculate perhaps you, also, should watch this film alone. Of course, if you are not comfortable with the things above, perhaps you shouldn't view this film at all.)
As I age, having spent a happy--very warm-blooded, very sensual-- younger life, all things sexual are starting to seem fantastic. Sex is becoming more and more and more just a type of fiction (perhaps most akin to science fiction). So, to me, the appearance in this film of transexuals and whores, of a prostitute with bunny ears and a cello-playing dwarf is not unusual. No more unusual than that other-worldly presence in this film-- always on stage--sex.
And, to me, all this stuff about organs is just a device, serves only as a transition, to what really matters in the film: the music.
That is what shines in this movie: the music. . .the music. . .the music. That is why one should not miss this film.",1211760000,2,1048,4.609625668449198
2670490,3,B000JFXRWE,"I was really surprised to see full male nudity in this movie.  I guess i wouldn't recommend that you watch it with any str8 people that might be offended, or your parents, it might get awkward.  The music numbers are very well done, and the singing is not bad at all.  I think the story is cute, and we'll done, so having said all that i rated it a 3.  I will probably watch it again, the spanish was a bit hard to keep up with for me.",1192579200,,435,3.909090909090909
2670491,3,B000JFXRWE,"Critics for the most part panned this musical Almodovarian clone about a pre-operative transexual whose dream is to become a biological woman.  I understand some of their concerns, like lack of a true plot and awkwardly placed musical numbers.  And, at times it felt somewhat derivative (especially a musical number that seemed like a ripoff of Michael Jackson's THRILLER).  But, I was nonetheless charmed by this unorthodox, humanistic and profoundly touching celluloid poem to transgendered people.  The respect it conveys to the central character makes her life, her dreams and, yes, her libido worthy of the highest form of celebration.  My three star rating is more a statement on the film's less than perfect story arc than its overall message.  If a little more time had been given to developing the script, this fairly obscure little gem would have done much better at the box office.  I highly recommend it to those who are willing to overlook its flaws.",1192147200,2,963,5.018867924528302
2670492,4,B000JFXRWE,"Writer/actor/director Ramn Salazar ('Amnsia', 'Piedras') is becoming a formidable presence on the Spanish cinema scene. He takes risks, he knows he takes them, and he makes them turn out in his favor. '20 Centimeters' is a mix of a story that is part hilarious musical comedy and part sensitive character portrayal of people who live just outside the edge of what is cruelly called 'normal': the mix makes for a jolly fluffy cake that smacks of Salazar's predecessors Almodvar and Fellini.

Marieta (the enormously talented Mnica Cervera) is a work in progress: she dresses as a woman, has breast implants, is on painful steroid injections, but still retains the 20 centimeter remnant that prevents her from becoming the totally feminine woman she desires. She has a heart of gold, works the streets as a prostitute with special gifts to earn money for her transgender surgery. But at home she shares an apartment with a dwarf Toms (the very handsome and talented Miguel O'Dogherty) who squanders Marieta's money on ticket scams that don't work, cares for her friend Berta's (Concha Galn) son, and provides emotional support to her fellow sex workers. She has a major problem: she has narcolepsy and falls asleep for several hours at a time in the most inappropriate places (!) and during these sleep periods dreams of Broadway musical numbers occur in which she is the singing (in Spanish, French and English) and dancing star with a cast of hundreds in the wildest of costumes!

Marieta yearns for love and when she notices one Raul (the very hunky and talented Pablo Puyol) she feels she is in love, especially when Raul returns her attention, takes her home to meet his rather low class gross parents and family, and most importantly physically falls in love with her - AND her 20 centimeter unwanted obstruction to happiness. How Marieta comes to grips with her focal surgical dream versus her chance for love is the tender way the film concludes.

Mnica Cervera carries this very difficult role extremely well, not only allowing us to see the inner suffering being she truly is but also popping the cork off the champagne bottle of musical production numbers that pepper this fun movie. The cast is uniformly fine (Pilar Bardem, the mother of superstar Javier Bardem, has a fine little cameo role) and the direction show that Ramn Salazar has tight reins on his talent. This is a film that is bawdy fun without ever spilling over into the realm of bad taste. Watching it is a toe-tapping good time! Grady Harp, December 06",1165795200,10,2528,4.860788863109049
2670493,4,B000JFXRWE,"20 Centimeters is a quirky, sexy fiesta of a film, with light and darkness mixed in beautiful measure.

The quirky is at the film's core. The main character is pre-op transsexual Marieta (Monica Cervera), who has multi-hour narcoleptic snoozes in the middle of shopping, interviewing and working either at the train depot or hunting tricks on the streets as a hooker. During her snoozes, she imagines herself as a seductive, playful heroine of musical scenes that transform the city into colorful visions of casts of dancers leaping and sliding to Marieta's singing in English, French and English.

The interesting thing is, Marieta's fantasy life really is fantasy of gender, not occupation. She doesn't want to be a singer or an actress - maybe a news anchorwoman, she says. These flights are on a par with the campy, stylish glitz of the Australian drag queens of The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but these song dreams are the flights of an imaginative regular man-woman.

The quirk doesn't stop there, though: Her best friend and roommate is a dwarf who can't seem to make any money. The funny thing is, after 15 minutes in the world of Marieta, the quirk fits right in. For a chick with a dick who sells herself on the streets, but yearns for a regular job, it's just a day in her life: caring for her neighbor's son, lying around with her handsome gay friend, and yearning for the peach-buttocked grocery stocker.. Some unexpected things unfold for Marieta and her friends, but nothing truly overwhelming for what turns out to be a hell of a woman who just wants to be rid of her 20-centimeter/8-inch problem.

In all her interactions with women, Marieta proves to be every bit as womanly yet possessed of a strength that comes with a life of fighting to be who she wants to be with care, compassion and a zest for life - real or fantasy.",1163721600,19,1861,4.699386503067485

2670498,4,B000JFXRWE,"I've truly enjoyed owning this movie and replaying some of my more favorite scenes from time to time.

The contrast between a serious, touching story and more upbeat, sometimes silly (in a GOOD way!) song and dance numbers is filmmaking at it's classic, artistic best. I thoroughly love the way the director weaved the lighthearted, but well-choreographed musical numbers into the drama of a story about a person struggling to just get through life and come to terms with their true place in it. Marvelously done!

The only thing one must be aware of is that this is not your standard American, family-values kind of movie. It has it's share of vulgarity and profanity, not to mention a few scenes that shockingly border on pornographic. If one looks through the lens of film as an artistic expression, and can appreciate that this is not a regurgitation from Hollywood, those scenes can be better appreciated for their artistic merit.

Last of all, I have to honestly say that the lead character could've used a few more singing lessons before the film was finished. She is very capable in her role as protagonist and projects the heartaches and joys of a transsexual woman very authentically despite not actually being transsexual in real life, but her ability to sing forcefully and in tune is not consistent. For this reason alone I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5.",1355443200,4,1373,4.809322033898305

This movie is a MUST SEE if you are gay or into gay themed movies...they say on the back of the DVD, that it's similar to ""Priscilla"" & the director,Aldomovar...BUT I tend to disagree, in the fact that it's its OWN MOVIE....from the art direction, costumes, choreography etc.....it's just a perfect movie..I do not know WHY the heck it did not make it here in the USA and get marketed...THIS would even make a great Broadway show...HEY PRODUCERS>>>YOU LISTENING!!....LOVED,,LOVED IT !!!!

 THANK YOU to Ramon Salazar, who wrote and directed it

it is a TOP TEN for me now, of Gay themed movies!
