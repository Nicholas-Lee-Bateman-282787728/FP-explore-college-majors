272915,3,6300247597,"The film opens with Phillipe (now grown) at his mother's funeral. Phillipe asks his uncle (Vincent Price)what exactly happened to his father, but Price will not say. Phillipe is determined to continue his father's  expieriments, so he hires an assistant and works day and night trying to  complete the work.  The problem is his assistant is a criminal bent on  stealing Phillipe's work and selling it on the underground.  The assistant  knocks out Phillipe and throws him into the dis-integration chamber with a  fly, pulls the switch and, well, like father, like son.  Good sequel  holds onto science aspests of first film instead of just concentrating on  the monster.  The acting is very strong for the genre and the stark black  and white photography really helps create a mood for this film.  The first  film is better,but this one is worth seeing too.",950227200,2,857,4.9020979020979025

273038,5,6300247597,"I hadn't seen this movie in a really long time. It was great seeing it, and in High Definition. It had more twists than I had remembered.  I think it is interesting to note that this sequel is in Black and White while the original was in Color. These are great science fiction classics. Be sure to get a code free blu ray player as so many American movies, shows and favorites are not available here, so we must buy them from other countries and they won't play on a standard American Blu Ray player.",1452556800,,500,4.2631578947368425
273039,5,6300247597,"You don't need to watch the original ""The Fly"" before you watch ""Return of the Fly"" but it might make it more fun. Either way, this is a classic old sci-fi movie that stands on its own just fine!",1443830400,,195,4.0256410256410255
273040,5,6300247597,"This is an old favorite movie of mind.  The plot is intriguing with no heavy violence or horror (that is compared to today's horror movies).  These were the times when horror movies were made without destroying the man's dignity.  No profanity, no sex and no indecent exposure.  This came out in 1959.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-Of-The-Fly/dp/B000UKYFG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return Of The Fly</a>",1438560000,,457,6.827586206896552

273042,5,6300247597,"While no sequel is ever as good as the original, this is a movie that can stand on its own.  I think it is just as good as the first one and I was happy with.  It is certainly a movie I will watch again again.  I purchased this for my electronic library because I did not feel the need to have the media. I am very happy with the fact that I can go to my library from my phone or tablet whenever I want to and watch this. It is also handy to be able to access it on my home theatre system you finish one and then go to the next; it avoids having to run up and down the stairs switching out DVD's .",1392336000,,597,3.6484375
273043,5,6300247597,"The Return of the Fly is 78 minutes long and was released August 1959. This film was shot in black and white to save on costs. Also with this Fly, his head is bigger and his left arm and right leg are part of a fly. In the original only the head and left arm are parts of the fly. With the fly only the head of the human is showing; the right leg and left arm are missing. The story is set fifteen years in the future. The movie starts off with the funeral of Helene DeLambre. Her son Philippe DeLambre and his Uncle Franois DeLambre are at the funeral. On the way home Philippe pressure his Uncle Franois to tell him the truth about the death of his father. Franois takes Philippe to his father's laboratory and tells Philippe the whole story. Philippe wants to continue in his father work. Francois is against it. Philippe and his friend Alan Hinds construct a new lab in the basement of Philippe's grandfather home. Alan decides to sell the plans to the black market. Philippe corners Alan in the lab. A fight takes place and Philippe is knocked out and is put into the machine with a fly. When he re-emerges, he has the head, left arm and right leg of a fly. In the end he is returned to normal. Vincent Price is the only one from the original movie to reprise his role. I give this movie an A.",1234742400,4,1298,4.196
273044,5,6300247597,"This is an interesting sequel to 1958's ""The Fly."" Brydon Baker's black & white photography gives it a feel of film noir instead of science fiction. Both Vincent Price and Bret Halsey turn in believable performances. This can be attributed to Director Edward Bernds' choice to concentrate on characterization over the science fiction elements, which had also been effectively accomplished in the original. John Sutton as Inspector Charas turned in his best performance since 1952's ""Five Fingers."" The score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter was very effective to the mood of the piece. This is an excellent and highly underrated film.",972086400,7,634,5.2254901960784315
273045,4,6300247597,"The original ""Fly"" is in widescreen and in color, and when Bad Things begin to happen, the creamy production values and posh suburban settings give the horror a disturbing power. What's really creepy about ""The Fly"" is watching the hero Andre trying to hang on to his humanity as it slowly ebbs away. ""Return of the Fly,"" the pissant sequel, was obviously filmed quickly on a ""B"" budget and goes in for obvious horror movie effects: thunderstorms, funerals, and really big spider webs in the old abandoned la-bore-a-tory. When you think about it, you can't blame those spiders, though, can you? The plot has son Phillippe attempting to vindicate Andre's work by attempting The Exact Same Experiment... naturally The Exact Same Thing happens. By the time Phillippe is lumbering through the countryside looking for payback (and maybe a Dunkin Donuts), the movie has moved firmly and forever into high camp; Vincent Price obliges with a truly outrageous last closeup. ""The Fly"" is almost a masterpiece, but you'll want a swatter handy for the sequel.",967334400,2,1047,5.022988505747127
