8142397,5,B000HXZ94C,"Excellent collection of short stories that show the soul of Napoli.  These films, wonderfully written and directed, make clear the Neapolitan saying ""Eat well and drink now, for tomorrow you may die"".  This is said because of the looming presence of the volcano Mount Vesuvio which can wipe everybody out when it blows. They also show the resilience of Neapolitans who have been through many a tragedy and struggle and who have learned to survive.  This art of survival is known as l'aringiarsi.  I believe it is why Neapolitans do so well no matter where they end up in the world.  I have this film in two DVD versions.  I am pretty sure that this one does not have English subtitles.  You would also be wise to check and see what zone it is labeled for.  It may not play on American sold DVD players.  You need an unlocked DVD player.  Yeah, you heard that right. Unless an American company somehow makes money on product and/or distribution on the foreign film, it won't play because Hollywood has made deals with all of the manufacturers so that what is sold in the U.S. only plays Hollywood American made films.  Be careful.",1497225600,,1129,4.595
