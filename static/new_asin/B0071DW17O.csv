NTR looks a bit unassuming for a leading man, but he is up to every challenge, and there are a lot of them in this Tollywood production.  Tamanna is beautiful and get to show some real acting chops as the story unfolds.  It's an action/comedy/romance/crime thriller/revenge story with some amazing songs and dancing thrown in.  This would be a great introduction to Tollywood films and will be enjoyable across multiple-watches.  If you like Bollywood films, give this one a shot as well.",1470614400,,666,4.747826086956522
