8100539,3,B000CQPGYM,The video was not what we expected.  If I had not already made plans to visit Prague I would certainly not find inspiration from this video.  The quality of the video was at times poor.,1255824000,4,185,4.257142857142857
8100540,1,B000CQPGYM,"This DVD does not do justice to Prague, one of the world's most beautiful cities. The quality (photograpy & reproduction) of the DVD is so poor that I wish that I had not bought it.  Its content is equally bad.  I am surprised that Amazon sells something that is so bad.",1187827200,,270,4.2745098039215685
