3521633,5,B001D261UC,"I love this workout DVD! I bought it for my mom first, because she, too, loves The Firm tapes, and she let me borrow it.  I love that I can get a good workout in 30 minutes.  It gets your heartrate up and you feel good afterwards.  Some of the cardio was a little tricky to learn the first time because she moves through it real quick and doesn't give much time to practice(and I am an advanced user), but once you do it a few times, you will get it and then it's fun.
Highly recommend!",1234483200,2,486,3.9896907216494846
3521634,2,B001D261UC,"I like very much Emily as a Firm instructor, but this DVD is not what I expected from her. The instructor usually cues very well, but in this one she goes so fast it's almost impossible to follow. I know its only 30 minutes but that should not interfere with her cueing. The first strengh segment for me was the worst(the part of the squat then turn then lat rows) in one point she even kind of laugh, I guess she knows its too fast. I had done the DVD more than 5 times, since I want to give it a chance and still find it a bit off. I have more than 35+ Firm DVD's and find this one just ok. I should had rent it first instead of buying right away.",1233446400,,649,3.887218045112782
3521635,4,B001D261UC,"This was a pretty good execution of a half hour workout.  There were a couple of cuing issues but I'm sure if I did the video a few times, I wouldn't notice anymore.  I worked up a good sweat and I'm not a novice, so I think it's worth an add to the library.",1232755200,,258,3.759259259259259
3521636,3,B001D261UC,"I've found that Firm workouts vary greatly in quality depending on the instructor.  Some instructors are wonderful, with clear, concise cueing, while others are nearly impossible to follow.  This one falls in the middle.  The sculpting sections were MUCH clearer, for me, than the cardio sections.
It's a decent workout, and it is only 30 minutes (great for those days when you don't have much time).  I think that the more I do it, the easier it will be to follow along.",1232582400,4,471,4.7073170731707314
3521637,1,B001D261UC,"I did not like this workout the instructor moves too fast and goes from one move to another way too soon.
I wish I did not waste my money on this dvd because I am sure I will not use it, because it is too difficult to learn the moves.",1232582400,8,234,3.7
3521638,4,B001D261UC,"I really like this DVD although it does not cut you any slack if you are a beginner to the FIRM series.  There are alot of quick transitions and I felt like I had 2 left feet.  I am determined to learn the moves though.  To enjoy this workout, you have to be patient and give yourself time to adjust to it.  Be prepared, this may take awhile but don't give up.  I think it is worth it in the end!!!",1231632000,,398,3.8641975308641974
3521639,5,B001D261UC,"Although, I have to agree with the other reivews, that this video moves very quickly from one move the next.  I also realize that it has to!  This is a 30 minute workout.  To get anything out of it, you're going to have to move fast!  Emily does a great job of fitting a lot into 30 minutes.  I myself had to do the video a couple of times to get used to what comes next.  But what you're used to the sequencing, it's a great workout for a short amount of time.  With alot of 30 minute workouts, once you finish warming up the workout is over.  Not this one.  You waste no time, and get right into the workout.  It will definitely get your heart rate up.",1228867200,,654,4.0
3521640,2,B001D261UC,"This video was ok, however I found myself rewinding because Emily moved from one move to the next so quickly you did not have time to catch it.  Slow down!!  After doing it a couple of times I'm sure I will be ok because I will know what is coming next.",1228780800,,253,3.9411764705882355
3521641,4,B001D261UC,"This workout was a little bit frustrating for me the first time I did it.  It wasn't that the moves were too dancy or difficult, I just didn't feel like Emily gave much warning when she was going on to the next move.  Another problem was that the music wasn't much quieter than her talking.  Also, her rhythm was different - she marched on the upbeat instead of downbeat, and that bothered me a bit.

Like I said, it wasn't my favorite, but if you're a firmie (especially if you need more videos with this length), I'd still get it if I were you.",1228521600,12,546,4.221153846153846
3521656,1,B001D261UC,Save your self few dollars and buy something else. The worst workout in my opinion! Way too fast!. As a result you can't even do these moves! Very confusing and useless workout. I will never buy a workout with this terrible instructor!,1465776000,,235,4.619047619047619

3521661,4,B001D261UC,"This is not one of my favorite workouts, but I still like it. It gets the job done in 30 minutes and you are drenched in sweat when done. Emily is very good at demonstrating the moves. She moves fast in this workout, but I think it's because she wants to hit every muscle group that she can in a half hour.",1451692800,,306,3.9516129032258065

3521665,5,B001D261UC,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,2,1486,4.427007299270073

3521687,3,B001D261UC,"Ummm, what the heck?! Picture look of utter confusion on my face as I try to keep up with this insanely fast workout dvd with terrible cues. But after the third time doing it, I am starting to pick up the moves and I do sweat and its good when I don't have much time to workout. I consider myself pretty advanced with choreographed workouts and it was difficult to follow the first couple times. At least her voice doesn't annoy me like some of the other instructors. I still think Jillian Michaels 30 day shred is the best 30 min workout I've done.  I love the Firm Calorie Explosion too. But I was looking for something fast paced and wanted to mix up my workouts a bit. I think it's worth getting if you want a change but I wouldn't get it if you're a beginner.",1424044800,,764,4.197278911564626
3521688,4,B001D261UC,"I bought this video a few years ago, mainly because it's only half an hour.  I have other Firm videos and like the moves that they use.  This video was a bit difficult at first, but once I learned it there were no problems.  I have deducted a star because there are no core exercises.  There are only a few to work the middle area at the end, but not really enough to flatten and tighten up that problem area for most women.  I do like the high energy and the shortness of the workout.",1417478400,,485,4.063157894736842

3521690,5,B001D261UC,"The workout was different than what I was expecting but it's definitely one I will do often. It was quick paced and you really have to learn it before you can get into it but after that, its smooth sailing. The workout keeps your muscles from plateauing and developing memory of certain exercises. That is what I like most about it. It provides different moves throughout the work out so you're always in a state of burning fat.",1402444800,,428,4.5
3521691,5,B001D261UC,"Just like all videos from the Firm, this is awesome. This is a perfect workout for days when you don't have a lot of time. It's fairly high impact at the end, but you can modify it - gives me a great workout in 30 min - highly recommend!",1399334400,,237,3.857142857142857
3521692,2,B001D261UC,"I did not mind that it was a ""fast pace"" workout but the ""moves"" were to complicated as with most firm workouts.  They need to make the moves effective but simple so you can do them correctly.  thank you  Sharon Davey",1399334400,,217,4.2439024390243905
3521693,3,B001D261UC,"I've had other video's by Emily which I found to be awesome.  This one is good; however, I think she is moving way too fast.  Exercises are easy to follow but she is doing exactly as promised, squeezing a workout in to 30 minutes.  My thought is they should have slowed down a bit with some other options and still meet the mark for a good 30 minute workout.",1395100800,,358,4.159420289855072
3521694,4,B001D261UC,"I have to say...this one out of ALL the ""pink"" firms, has the BEST music. :) I love when they play good music. I gave this one 4 stars because she DOES seem to go really fast and sometimes her cuing was off. But if you are not new to the FIRM, then the quick changes are not hard getting used to. The moves overall were fun, just wish the workout was longer...but then again it's supposed to be a ""quick"" workout.

A fun little workout to do when very short on time even tho I prefer much longer workouts. This is also a great add on to another all cardio workout as well.",1391472000,,572,4.017543859649122
3521705,4,B001D261UC,"The movement are varied for half and hour and I got a sweat definitely worth the money. Usually I work out for about an hour, but by the time I was finished I felt energised rather than exhausted after an hour.

3521707,5,B001D261UC,It might only be a half hour but you can't tell by the amount of sweat. It feels like a full workout. Give yourself enough time for a shower. You can't skip it.,1374537600,,160,3.878787878787879
3521708,5,B001D261UC,I have owned this one for a couple years. It does take time to learn the moves.  This one has become one of my favorites. I have little time to workout and this one is effective and fast. It's not boring and still remains challenging.,1363651200,,234,4.2
3521709,2,B001D261UC,"I really like the Firm overall but I didn't care for this workout.  Because it is boasting a tough workout in 30 minutes, I felt like many of the moves were rushed and I could not get proper form before we were either moving faster or on to something else.  I like Emily as an instructor, I just dont' care for this routine.",1363305600,,324,4.126984126984127

It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep up with and the instructor is shrill and irritating. A complete and total waste of my time and money. I am very disappointed with the Firm and their advertisement of this DVD.",1362528000,3,373,4.3428571428571425
3521711,4,B001D261UC,"After reviewing many of the comments and decided the negatives weren't bad enough to prevent me from purchasing this exercise video. I am very glad that I did. I love it, its a great workout video, all areas are worked and I was able to see results qucikly.
While it is fast moving and only minimal warning/instruction is given, you have to keep in mind this is only a 30 minute workout. If more time was given to instruction it would defeat the purpose of a quick workout. If you're already a firm user, you won't have any trouble following the instructor and you won't be disappointed.
The price was great also, as The Firm was offering it at almost $10 more.",1362096000,,661,4.426229508196721

The choreography can be a little tricky, but nothing too difficult after a couple of tries.  I worked up a good sweat and felt like I got a good workout in just 30 minutes.  I appreciate Emily's energy, although some might find her a little too peppy.  If you like the Firm ""pink"" videos, I think you will like this one!",1358553600,,450,4.309523809523809

3521725,5,B001D261UC,"Great workout that didn't get the best reviews.  Packs A LOT into 30 minutes!  I personally thought cueing was excellent~it just moves very fast (but not dangerously so IMO, even at 100+ pounds overweight).  This ended with a pretty thorough stretch for such a short workout.  I know I will love this workout even more the more I get familiar with it!",1333065600,,351,4.612903225806452

Even following the modified versions of the exercises without weights, I get a quick, fast-paced workout and have the sweat to prove it! The instructor does cue, you just have to pay attention to what she is saying since she doesn't always use common exercise terms. The movements are quick, so the routine can be hard to keep up with on the first try. But if you just keep moving and catch up to the instructor, you will still get a good workout. Some reviewers have complained about the music, but I don't even notice it until it's time to transition to another segment by marching in place, and then the beat is at a good volume to set the pace for the upcoming segment.",1324425600,,736,4.37956204379562

Everything moves very quickly, and I found a lot of the moves awkward-- many just didn't seem to naturally flow together, and/or involved too many directional changes. Personally, it would take me more than a couple times through to catch on, if I ever did.  This one will be going on the shelf for awhile.",1318204800,,460,4.3882352941176475
3521730,5,B001D261UC,"This is about 30 minutes long.  It alternates between cardio intervals and sculpting moves.  The cardio intervals are sometimes hard to follow because they change very quickly but this will improve with time and I was able to keep up for the most part.  The moves ranged from athletic moves like jumping jacks to traditional v steps and repeaters to samba dancy moves to mild kickboxing.  The hardest move was probably jumps 3 feet up in the air repeated 4 in a row at a time as part of a cardio burst.

There are 3 exercisers including 1 who does the modifications the whole time.  This means for example she never uses weights.  The sculpting moves with weights start out slow and build on.  Of course being the firm there are a lot of lunges and squats.

I felt the ab work was limited in this routine although a few exercises were included at the end.

The instructor is very peppy and talks a lot but says comments like she is really encouraging you and feeling what you do.

I liked this workout bottom line because you get a good workout in 30 minutes.  It's also been out awhile so it would be good inexpensive choice for someone wanting to get back into exercise.

I'm sure this dvd is great for people who have been in The Firm program.  However, for newbies like me, I was at a total loss.  In the beginning it was okay, but as the workout progressed I could not keep up.  I kept having to stop the dvd and rewind so I could try to figure out what the instructor was doing.  I eventually gave up in frustration.  I'm sure this may be great for people who have been in the program and know the moves but it's not a pick for an outsider like me.",1302739200,,615,3.911290322580645

Once I have the moves down, this will be a lot of fun and will get me sweating.  I don't recommend this to first timers, but once you get used to The Firms moves (I recommend Allison's workouts in the beginning) this one is a good, quick workout that hits all areas of the body.",1301443200,,525,4.067961165048544

That's great when time is limited. She does move fast so the first few times I did it, I felt a little uncoordinated but now I have it pretty mastered and thoroughly enjoy it. I like how she does not have much jumping or bouncing in this workout. It is definitely a workout that gets the endorphins flowing. I highly recommend it!",1301443200,,482,4.193548387096774

This workout might be great if you are 20 years old, but if you are 46 with 30 pounds to lose, this is NOT for you. They go WAY too fast, cueing happens at the exact second she does the move and she only does it a couple of times before adding more to something you don't even have down yet. It's insane. The camera hops around from girl to girl at an equally breakneck speed, so you can't even watch any of them doing the moves all the way thru.

Don't start with one random video like this - use a SYSTEM. i.e. BSS 1, 2, 3,4 or transformation  to introduce yourself to the firm.

Emily is hardcore and she doesn't mess around. This DVD also assumes that you've been with us for a while. So for someone who has all the systems and been firming FOREVER, yea, the cueing to music rhythm is off and that sucks. But ignore it and focus on what she's saying.

I find it highly insulting that some reviewers would cut down others who find this workout to be too fast.  Yeah, it IS too fast and I believe a really good workout DVD will have an instructor who can lead you through from start to finish, sweaty and feeling accomplished.  The first few workouts on this DVD may make someone feel like giving up right away and extremely frustrated.  So all in all, good workout, not so great instructor.

3521770,5,B001D261UC,"This is one of my favorite videos for working out. It's efficient, combines cardio and sculpting, works the important muscle groups, and is interesting enough so that I can use it again and again without getting bored. While I don't recommend it for beginners or people who have a hard time learning new moves, I do for someone who wants a good, interesting workout in 30 minutes.",1275523200,,380,4.686567164179104
3521771,1,B001D261UC,I own a lot of the firm videos and they are usually good.  I have never written a review before but after trying this out today-- I have to say my opinion.  the music sucks and doesn't even match the rythm of the program-- in fact the background music makes even more difficult to follow this difficult program.  It's not hard physically but hard to follow.  Why can't instructors understand that you don't have to have a difficult  choreography  to have a great workout.  Just when u think u got the pattern --it swithces to something else and the cuing is awful.  i was so frustrated that I just want to throw this disc away.  I can tell that at some part even the background girls in the video was off-- that tells u something.  DON'T BUY THIS DISC-- IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY.,1272326400,13,781,4.287671232876712
3521772,5,B001D261UC,"Emily has long been one of my favorite Firm Instructors, so I wasn't too hesitant about picking this up. This is a pretty high intensity all-around workout-- & there are no breaks. And only 30 minutes long. It's perfect when you need to squeeze alot into a little time. There's one section I just can't seem to do (I call it the 'cheer-leader jump'), if you can't either, just pyramid down to jumping jacks, you'll still get a great deal of benefit from it. I highly recommend this DVD for those times when you're crunched for time.",1270857600,2,532,4.494845360824742
3521773,5,B001D261UC,"First - loved this workout from Emily.  If you're a long time Firmie, this one uses many of the old, familiar moves so you won't be lost.  It does move fast and does modify some old moves and adds some new ones.  But if you've done other ""pink weights"" workouts, you'll recognize the fast pace and the multiple part moves (squats w/biceps and abduct leg).

All in all, I loved it.  I'd be moving along and realize I had a giant smile on my face :)  And those moisture drops on the floor were not rain - they were me sweating up a storm!

If you're new to The FIRM, don't start with this one.  I always recommend the older ones (Cardio Sculpt!) or choosing Allie or Allison as your first instructors.  They are much easier to follow because the moves are simple, the changes come slower, and they explain the moves in great detail.

A quick run-down of the workout-

0:00  warm-up

3:45  Sculpt #1  (side lunges, side squats, curtsy dips, squats w/biceps, lunges - all with addons of biceps, leg abducts, etc).  *I didn't do the twisting row because I'm cautious of my back, but just did squats w/row).  I used 5# and 8#s for both Sculpt segments.

10:00 Cardio 1 - lots of fun and PURE Emily (if you've like Burn & Shape, you'll like this one).  My favorite new move was her ""knee repeater"" which was really the quad star (or tri star) with a knee pump in between each step).

15:00 Sculpt #2 - dips w/oh press, side lunge w/tricep/bicep, lat row with leg lift, deadlift (I did this as a regular deadlift as I'm not sure how safe it is on one side & I""m extra cautious with my back), and push ups (fun ones!)

21: Cardio 2 ends with a fun power move (running in place moves) then goes straight into abs with no cooldown.

26:  Abs - the first ab move is standing with reaches to knees, toes across the body.  Serves as a sufficient cool down IMO.  Then to the floor for one set of planks on the toes/hands.

28: Stretch - good stretch, surprising long, but the music was still very fast paced which kind of threw me at first.",1269734400,33,2025,4.2631578947368425
3521774,4,B001D261UC,"Based on some of these reviews I was waiting to get to the part that was cued poorly and/or hard to follow (because I like to be challenged), but it never came. In fact, for the intermediate to advanced exerciser this is very easy and fun to do. There is no problem with cueing either. It's not the most challenging workout, but there is a half hour of decent cardio & weights if you're short on time.",1269388800,,401,4.220779220779221
3521775,1,B001D261UC,"I picked this up because I have used other (better) Firm videos and liked that this one was just a half hour long. It was awful!! I have several dance type workout dvds in my collection and I can keep up just fine with those, so it's not as if I'm one of those people with two left feet. As other reviewers have noted, Emily moves WAY too fast, does not stick with one move for very long, gives almost non-existent cuing and doesn't match the beat very well. I suppose if I was extremely persistent and really worked on this for a couple of weeks I could probably get it down. But why should I waste my time? I got this to SAVE time as I know that the Firm videos can be very effective. Besides, by the time I finally mastered this I would most likely be bored of the routine and want to move on to something else. My general feeling about ALL the newer Firm workouts is that they move at a pretty fast pace and give minimal cues. However, up until this one I've been able to keep up and catch on.",1269302400,20,997,4.065989847715736
3521776,5,B001D261UC,This workout really does pack in the typical Firm cardio with sculpting in half an hour.  A great workout.,1261958400,,106,4.578947368421052
3521777,2,B001D261UC,"I stopped this tape after seven minutes because I could not follow the moves.  I am just not able to learn that many different moves in milliseconds.

3521778,5,B001D261UC,"I read the reviews on this workout DVD after I bought it and almost returned it because so many reviews said it was too hard to follow. I am so happy I kept it!! It is my favorite workout dvd so far. Yes, it is fast paced, but by the 2nd time I was following pretty well, and by the third time I was fine. It is an awesome workout in only 30 minutes. You will sweat and the thirty minutes fly! I really liked Emily Welsh as an instructor also. I will be looking for more of the Firm videos with her as the instructor.",1258156800,3,517,3.8867924528301887
3521779,2,B001D261UC,I did not like this video. Emily's cueing  was awful. She tried to do to much at one time and it was impossible to keep up with her. I have been doing the firm for years and this was a total waste of money for me. Don't waste your time or money on this video.,1253664000,,259,3.709090909090909
3521780,3,B001D261UC,"After reading other reviews, I was skeptical of buying this DVD.  I'm fairly new to the Firm series. However, I thought I would give it a try and see what it was like.  After receiving it and going thru the routine a few times, I would have to agree that it is hard to follow in parts.  Much harder to follow than the other Firm DVD's I have (Susan Harris Basics and Volume 3).  Having said that, I now just do the parts of the DVD that use hand weights and are not aerobic (with the quickly changing moves and complicated steps).  I run thru them each 2 times.  I feel I get a good work out, I'm sweating and burning calories.  I would recommend this DVD only if you are not easily frustrated with switching up your moves every couple of seconds with little or no warning.  I'll stick to my other Firm DVD's and use this one only to change things up a bit :).  Over all rating a 3 out of 5.",1252972800,3,891,4.045714285714285
3521781,4,B001D261UC,"This workout is extremely fast paced, because the instructor, Emily, is squeezing in a total-body workout in just 30 minutes. I didn't mind the fast pace, though-it made me want to return to the workout again and again for a few days so I could master each move. Once you've mastered each move, it's a lot of fun!

There's not a lot of ""hand-holding"" in this workout. The cues are fast and Emily is so out of breath at times that she's a little hard to understand. Before trying this workout, I definitely recommend becoming familiar with the FIRM first. 2 great starter DVDs are Cardio Overdrive and Hard Core Fusion.",1249948800,,618,4.5675675675675675
3521792,4,B001D261UC,"While many others have given this DVD a poor review, it's actually a pretty good workout. It is only 30 minutes and can fit into anyone's busy schedule -- even over lunch. It's not too easy but not too complicated either -- just a nice in between for a moderate level.  Also, any one who is familiar with The Firm workouts and Emily Welsh's workouts in particular, will recognize several of the moves and quickly pick them up, enjoying the new twists and turns she introduces. Even if the cues are a bit too quick for some, the routines are repetitive enough that most people will be able to either pick them up by the end of the routine or by the time they do the workout the next time. That's the thing with Firm workouts. Sometimes you have to give yourself time -- perhaps doing the workouts several times -- before you can do the workout without too many missteps. But that's somewhat of a fun challenge -- when you get, it's great! And most routines can be easily modified, so as you are trying to pick up the more complicated steps, you are still getting a good workout. I think this is worth it!",1248912000,,1103,4.354368932038835
3521793,4,B001D261UC,"This is an excellent short workout.  I like Emily's style--she's all business and gets the most out of the time by being crisp and efficient.  I disagree with other reviewers that it is hard to follow or that the cuing is insufficient.  It will take a few run throughs to get everything right, but that is true of most of these videos.  It is important to use the weights, however.  I started seeing results very quickly as soon as I graduated to the weights, especially in my arms. The aerobic segments are fun, moderately challenging and really make you work up a sweat.  This video accomplishes everything I expected from it--some toning, some aerobics, and an overall feeling at the end that I have gotten a good work out in a short time.",1247184000,,742,4.541353383458647
3521794,5,B001D261UC,"I'm giving this video 5 stars because of how long the video is. This morning I was too tired to put in one of my usual 40 to 60 min videos from the FIRM on. This one is perfect because I only wanted to do 1/2 hour. That's all the time I had. So, no the cues aren't perfect. No video the first time you try it out should be easy. Once you get used to that, the time flies and your done. My favorite FIRM video is ""Get Chisle'd"" now that's a powerfull workout.",1245801600,,458,3.831578947368421
3521795,4,B001D261UC,"I agree with other reviewers in saying the cueing in this workout could have been much better.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

It's my go-to DVD when I'm pressed for time.",1244073600,,314,4.016129032258065
3521796,2,B001D261UC,"Even though I have been a Firm devotee for years, I had trouble with this DVD. Emily is way hyper here,lacks rythmn and gives virtually no cueing. There is no flow to the movement. I had to laugh at one particularly frustrating moment because one of the other excerciser/ instructors was looking at her in a way that totally echoed my feelings- like 'Girl, what the h*ll are you doing?'.

Should this video have come with a set of pom poms? We might try it again but are afraid that it may be doomed to be donated to someone with more patience.

The ""instructor' was absolutely annoying in personality.  Her cueing was awful/non-existent.  You would have to watch the video many times to learn the routine before you could actually try it as a workout, since she gives you about 2 seconds warning that something new is coming, and doesn't explain the step at all.  Also, the movements are very fast, so forget about making sure you have good form.  I'm not clumsy, and not new to workout videos, so I don't think this was a personal issue.  The first cardio segment is Tae-bo style, which would have been nice to know since that style tends to give me back troubles.  The 2nd cardio segment is a variation on salsa style with some jumping and jogging.  The strength portion is various upper body exercises combined with lots of squats and lunges.  The music is the usual bad workout track.  I would say skip it, there are far better half hour workouts out there.",1475366400,,1047,4.545454545454546
