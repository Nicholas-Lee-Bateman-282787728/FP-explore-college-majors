7814166,3,6301732197,"If you enjoyed the original ""mockumentary,"" (The Califonia Raisins:) MEET THE RAISINS, then you'd probably enjoy this campy sequel. It's not as good or funny as the original; but it does feature a few inside jokes here and there (and great covers to original Motown and disco tunes from the 70's). I do recall that the original film was such a Hit, that it spun-off not just this sequel but a cartoon series, based off those 4-characters (AC,Bebop,Stretch ...?) from MEET THE RAISIN ... I think it was called: ""California Raisins""(1989)(TV).",1148083200,3,541,4.956043956043956
