582776,5,6303167314,"Man, this special makes me so sad, but in a good way. I'm all man but every time I watch this I tear up. It's just so good and sweet and innocent. Charles Schultz really is a genius. Not that the Peanuts have the  answers to all the world's problems or anything, but the Peanuts, and  especially the Christmas special, are just so pure and good. And it's funny  too, the characters are just so well defined after having been around for  so long that their gags are really unique to each character. It's a great  video and people should be strapped to a chair with their eyes forced open  once a year to watch this special. It should be used to de-program violent  criminals. It captures everything that's good and bad about the holidays.",945993600,,737,4.4148148148148145
582777,5,6303167314,"I have watched this Christmas special every year since I was three years old (1965). It is a classic in every sense of the word.  From Vince  Guaraldi's score to Linus's true meaning of Christmas speech, everything  brings back memories of sitting in the living room drinking a glass of milk  and having a few Christmas cookies before bed.  If there is one Christmas  video to own, this is it.  Make it a family tradition.  My family has",940896000,9,437,4.512820512820513

The first special is the original special with the original story of the world's ugliest tree. The second special is a newer version by Bill Melendez with the same style and sound as always.

This DVD has two specials and the making of the Christmas special. The DVD is beautifully packaged with a cover to match the DVD case. The history and the making of the special is just as entertaining to the viewers. Maybe it was actual children's voices to help appeal to a wider audience.",1518998400,,625,4.681818181818182

585802,5,6303167314,"So, I see a lot of DVD reviews here, but I'm reviewing the Amazon Video digital download. I had to leave a review because there are some surprises that aren't explained very well in the description. I thought the price was pretty steep for a single special, but I bought it anyhow because it's a classic, and my toddler loves Peanuts. Then it started playing, and I realized the running time was more than an hour long. Here's what you get in the download:

1. A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965). This is the very first Peanuts special, and it's just as charming and rough around the edges as you remember it. It's a perfect mood piece for Christmas; if anything, it's too short. I get a little choked up at the end when the gang decides to be nice to Charlie Brown and fix his Christmas tree (even though I've probably seen it 50 times). The video is well done; I have my stereo hooked up to my TV, and the music sounds great. The video is high-def, which maybe doesn't matter for a 1960s animated film, but it's nice to have. DVD quality at least, maybe better.

2. It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown (1992). This one follows right after the first one's credits, with no indication that it's there until it starts playing. It's kind of a clunker, not one I'd rewatch often. There are some David Benoit covers of the Guaraldi Peanuts songs, but otherwise it's pretty forgettable.

3. It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown (1984). !!! I have no idea why this is stuck on the end of the download, since it has nothing to do with Christmas, but don't overlook it. After a boring first five minutes, this one transforms into the best of the Peanuts musicals. There's virtually no plot, but there are five great songs in succession: ""I'm in Shape,"" ""Lucy Says,"" ""Pigpen Hoedown,"" ""It's Snoopy,"" and of course ""Flashbeagle"" (twice). Each song is about two minutes in length, perfect for kids with short attention spans. Great songs, great vocals. ""Flashbeagle"" is cheesy and dated (it probably was in 1984!), but it's undeniably catchy. Everybody in the family will be humming these tunes all day after watching this special. A bit of trivia: Stacy Ferguson (better known as Fergie) played Sally in this special.

So, there you go. One moderately-priced download gets you two fantastic specials and one throwaway. Not bad! I would've given this five stars just for the main feature, but the bonuses just pushed it over the top. Thanks, Amazon!",1508025600,5,2435,4.695550351288056

586419,3,6303167314,Purchased this with my nostalgia in mind for the kids. Unfortunately it did not make it past the first ten minutes for my 5 year old and 2 1/2 year old. They wanted to watch something else Christmas. I ended up watching it after they went to bed but not what I intended it for. Dissapointed that they didn't care for it. I guess they are used to the more modern stuff. Sad.,1482883200,,373,4.123287671232877

586450,2,6303167314,"I have the DVD of this which I bought about 10 years ago, which is pretty good visually and not too good sonically. So I bought this Blu Ray thinking that it would be as spectacular and pristine as the Blue Ray of ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" which I also bought recently. I was disappointed. The DVD was apparently made from a taped copy that was used for TV broadcast. I remember when it was originally broadcast, the carol ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" sung by the kids at the end credits was played to the end of the carol. Many years later, the volume was turned down toward the end of the carol and cut off before the end, obviously to squeeze in more room for commercials. This Blue Ray is identical, lowering the volume to zero before the end of the song at precisely the same spot, which means the Blue ray was produced from the same taped copy and not from the original film. It is sharper and the colors more vivid than the DVD, but it is nothing but a remastered version of the tape in Blue Ray. Moreover, there are numerous points where the images go slightly out of register, and the skin tone colors shift within the same frames. There is also some distortion and static crackling at some points on the left rear surround channel. This is not my setup, it is the Blue Ray. I have thrown this Blue Ray in the garbage and will be continuing to watch the DVD, until such time, if ever, they come out with another Blue Ray version and do it right.",1482796800,2,1469,4.287769784172662

I mean, this is the cartoon that started people calling lousy Christmas trees ""Charlie Brown trees"" like forty years ago or so.  It's become a tradition in American society.  Vince Guaraldi's music was groundbreaking then, especially in a cartoon.  And the characters were spot-on.  And as for Linus telling the Christmas story of Jesus' birth and telling Charlie Brown ""That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown,"" is something that the ACLU hasn't managed to eradicate.  It's too integral a part of the cartoon, and is a message that needs to be sent every Christmas.

SO BAD!  I'm so sad that this was ever made and even worse I am so sad that I watched it and that my poor kid sat through it as her special holiday treat.  So the average of 5 stars and negative 1 star is 2.  There is also a football themed thing a the end.  Good grief!",1482537600,2,671,4.123076923076923

I'm leaving this review as a warning: the multi-format version does NOT include a DVD option. I thought multi-format meant just that, that there would be both Blu-Ray and DVD options included. I needed the DVD option to use on my computer at my mother's nursing home for Christmas Day. Fortunately, I opened it ahead of time and learned my error.

How sad and disappointed Charlie Brown would be if he witnessed what is happening in today's current society.

586777,5,6303167314,"One of my favorite episodes in the Charlie Brown series. The bluray is fairly decent, with a better picture than that of the outdated DVD. DVDs were not made for today's widescreen HD TVs. Now with 4K coming into play more common, standard DVDs do not look that great on 4K TVs and will not upgrade to 2160p. I have collected movies for decades beginning about 1989. I have quite a collection numbering into over 500 total. Mostly blurays now. I pretty much grew up watching these specials anytime they aired for whatever season it happened to be.
""The Great Pumpkin"" is still my all time favorite along with ""Fat Albert's Halloween Special"". This ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is a holiday treat for me as well. I wished though that the makers of this bluray would have given the viewers the option to watch it in the original audio mix vs. the 5.1 mix.
Sometimes, it is best to leave the original soundtrack alone. These specials were made mostly in the 1960s and stereo did not exist for TV, etc. So, making this one a 5.1 mix may not have a great feedback in audio. It was okay for me, but not out of this world fantastic.
I did like the specials on it also.

* Featurette: A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, THE MAKING OF A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS

Living in the South, we didn't usually have snow, but we had Charlie Brown to start off the season and to remind us of the TRUE meaning of Christmas.  It's not the gifts or the food or the parties or the stockings or the shopping, right Linus?  It's about the good news of the birth of our Savior. The lessons you taught us when we were kids are the lessons we taught our children, and share today with our children's children.  So glad I have it in my library to watch and share with my grand-daughter all year round. She's only 2, but she recognizes the beloved characters of Snoopy and the gang.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

My seven year old almost made it through the second movie but she gave up and asked to watch the Grinch instead.  I couldn't argue...I don't see the need to admit the second Charlie Brown Christmas is part of the order.

Charlie Brown goes through directing the school Christmas play, finds a tree, runs away, tries to fix the tree, fails....and everyone else realizes what his true intention was. They fix it up and lo and behold Charlie Brown and the gang realize that it's all about the spirit, rather than the business, and that sometimes it IS okay to go from the norm.

From the instant the first frame of this restored version of a cherished childhood classic I was spellbound. It had easily been 30 years since I last saw the special but can honestly say I enjoyed it more this time than any previous viewing. The story, the point of which was understandable even to a young child, carried a poignancy that brought a tear to my eyes.

The quality of the restoration and transfer are first rate, but as a warning to the nostalgia junkies out there, there is no way to reproduce the rabbit-ear fuzz that many of us peered through in our earliest viewings of this classic gem. ;) This was easily one of the best gifts I've received in the past couple of years.",1423440000,3,872,4.278787878787878

588814,5,6303167314,"Charlie Brown the all american boy who grew up but never came of age in nameless everywhere's-ville suburbia in the 1960's. As a disabled autistic kid I could identify strongly with the Charlie Brown character. Charlie Brown was an awesome teacher in that he never lost his spirit.  Charlie Brown was always on a search for the deeper meaning of holidays.  Charlie Brown upon encountering Christmas set himself on a journey to find the real meaning of Christmas.  He looses his composure almost to the point of dispondancy upon seeing Snoopy's Dog House.  Trust me all that money as Moscot of Met Life must pay well because; Snoopy's dog house was as tricked out as can be for a 1960's era puppy pad.  Snoopy's house proved dude traveled with the BIG DAWGS!

But seriously Snoopy's dog house represented everything commercial and trite that Christmas had appeared to become in Charlie Browns eyes. Charlie Brown in true non- autistic (Neurologically typical fashion) went upon talking to each of his friends trying to find the real meaning of Christmas. Charlie Brown eventually buys his now infamous little tree and attempts to decorate it.  A short visit to Linus and in one of the most touching monologues I've ever ever heard Linus reveals the true meaning of Christmas. It is the child like innocence laced with conviction that never fails to move me on hearing his explaination of the holidays true meaning.

I will deliver no more spoilers beyond the fact it ends happily for all concerned.  I enjoy the music.  For me the sound was great. I listened to the DVD over a beautiful 7.1 surround sound system and it times it felt as if the characters were in the room with me. A bit spooky when the sound is so real its like listening in on a conversation being had in the room with you.  The picture quality was pretty good considering I was used seeing this on a old color TV growing up and black and white before that. It's A Charlie Brown Christmas is part of my childhood that comes alive for me when I watch this.  A DVD of a show from my childhood is as close to a time machine as I can get and I love the experience even if it does not last anywhere near long enough.  Buy the DVD and rewaken your lost memories it's a truly awesome experience.",1398038400,2,2255,4.538271604938272

589013,5,6303167314,"A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) is Charles Schulz' masterpiece in my opinion, and the greatest television Christmas special of all time. From beginning to end, it's everything one wants a Christmas special to be: humorous, heartfelt, honest, and nostalgic. There are so many great one-liners in this one, and it's hard to pick a favorite, though I will say that I love Lucy's remark that she would like real estate for Christmas. Only Charles Schulz can deliver a special that's witty, sarcastically funny, and one that reflects how he (Schulz) feels about the holiday season with its commercial feel, compelling him to insert the scene with Linus giving the biblical and true meaning of Christmas to a confused Charlie Brown. This special has also been cited as having a tremendous influence on jettisoning the aluminum trees that were popular in the 1960s in favor of bringing back real trees. This special has managed to embed itself into the American psyche, especially when one loses perspective of the holiday. Pretty impressive for a 25 minute animated short. 10/10",1386288000,,1073,5.067796610169491

First of all, the classic A Charlie Brown Christmas is as charming as ever and it made me cry like it does every time. I always did love that special and looked forward to it every year, we would clear out our schedule in order to catch it when I was a kid.

As for this downloaded package, it also contains several other Charlie Brown animations that are obnoxious. Nowhere in the listing for this purchase did it mention these extras. They are more modern and don't have the charm of the Peanuts gang of the 1960s, which is what I purchased this movie to enjoy. There is no list of features to choose from to let me know they are there; they follow the feature presentation and I can't choose just to watch the movie on my computer from my couch without having to get up out of my blanket, make the cat move, and turn the thing off.

589053,4,6303167314,"I did like watching this Christmas special on video as a kid, seeing Charlie Brown experience the magic of Christmas. Well I have to admit, seeing children experience Christmas was very nice to see, heck even Snoopy gets a laugh. I really liked hearing the ""Linus and Lucy"" theme in this. I also really liked hearing the ""Hark the Harold"" sung by the Peanuts kids at the end. Whenever I think of ""Hark the Harold Angels Sing"", the one in this film is the first version that comes into my mind. However, I do have one major problem with this nowadays, and it is a scene I tend to fast forward through every time I watch it: the scene where the kids shoot down Charlie Brown for getting the tiny tree. I think that part is WAY too mean- spirited, even for a Peanuts carton. Heck, even Snoopy, our loveable dog comic relief laughs at his own owner! Nowadays bullying is against the law, and we're supposed to encourage our kids that bullying is bad, but this scene just doesn't work. We are supposed to like these characters, but after they bully Charlie Brown, you either want to punish them or want nothing to to with them. However, despite that major flaw, ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" is still enjoyable to watch in the Christmas season. The 2nd Charlie Brown Christmas special on this DVD...well....no.",1383609600,,1301,4.587982832618025

589057,5,6303167314,"""Charlie Brown Christmas"" is as essential to Christmas as the decorated tree. It's a jewel. It magically touches all your Christmas senses. It's as simple as that. Your childhood memories, the visions of Christmas you grew up with, the Peanuts gang in all their innocense and simplicity, a perfect winter day with all the winter landscape. If this doesn't put you in the Christmas mood, nothing will. Even in your adulthood, you can justify this CDs presence. The instrumentals are ageless, and haunting, in the best of ways. You might just find yourself ""snapping out of it"" after a tune or two. A great accompaniment to Christmas errands around the house, or in the Car while shopping. While this CD is a non-stop assault on your Christmas senses, it's never overbearing - perfect background music while talking with guests. While I've always been partial to both versions of ""Christmas Time Is Here"", there's really no point in judging or singling out any particular song. They're all essential, gorgeous Christmas melodies. Like most Christmas music, this CD is never outdated, and one that's never played too often during the season.

589174,5,6303167314,"""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" has been a tradition in my family every year since I was young, and back then we watched it on a VHS tape. Then came DVD, and now we have this lovely Blu-Ray edition.

Prospective buyers should note that the movie does not play in the full-screen format of many Blu-Rays. I assume that this is because the film was created for television and thus the aspect ratio was different. ""Charlie Brown"" shorts are not exactly known for sweeping visual quality in the first place; the style is sparse and simple, and that's what so many people, myself included, love about it. Despite the fact that the television screen isn't filled, the clarity of the picture is exceptionally vivid, putting our old VHS copy to shame. The special features include some interesting behind-the-scenes material, likely to delight any and all longtime fans of the film. The second feature included, ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"" gets very little play in our home. It just never caught on or made the same impact as the original, both with my family and the general public. Nonetheless, it's nice that it was included, it gives you just that much more bang for your buck.

I'd highly recommend this to any new or longtime fans of ""Peanuts."" If you're anything like me, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is essential holiday viewing, and this Blu-Ray is a great way to view it!",1357516800,3,1382,4.7782426778242675

However, Linus wraps his blanket around the tree, making it look healthier almost instantly.

In terms of entertainment, we have costumes, parades, and the Rockettes, along with numerous television specials and holiday music releases. However, nothing captures the pop culture spirit of the season like the Charlie Brown TV specials. Good old Chuck, Linus and Lucy, Snoopy, and the rest of the Peanuts gang epitomize the holidays like no one else.

In terms of holiday music, you can't do better than the soundtracks to the Charlie Brown specials. As enjoyable as holiday releases by major and independent artists can be, they don't compare to the beauty and innocence of the scores for the Peanuts specials. There are several albums that cover the music of the Peanuts shows, but I really recommend the actual soundtracks to the programs composed and performed by Vince Gauraldi.

589315,5,6303167314,"Yes, indeed, particularly as we stumble around uncertainly in this brand new year!  ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" along with ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" remain the three most favorite Christmas specials of my childhood.  I was lucky enough to view all three of them on their initial airdates, and each year thereafter including this past year.  I was already a big ""Peanuts"" enthusiast for several years, besides reading it in the daily paper; I also collected paperback anthologies of the comic strips that I believe cost all of $1.25 per copy.  So, when ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" debuted on CBS on Thursday December 9, 1965, I was right there in front of the television set, even though I was seeing it in glorious black and white.  My parents didn't buy a color set for another couple of years.  Regardless, I loved it and still do; it wouldn't be Christmas without viewing it at least once.  This past Christmas I both watched it on network television just to keep my hand in so to speak, and also on this DVD.  Commercial free and unedited the DVD wins hands down!

What makes this a timeless classic that remains evergreen fresh over 46 years past it's original showing?  To begin at the beginning, let's credit cartoonist Charles Schulz who cobbled together some scenes from past Christmas strips along with some fresh, original ideas into a sweet, simple story that had a universal appeal.  He wanted the snowy background, remembering his boyhood winters in Minnesota.  More importantly he was a deeply religious man.  It also was he who insisted on retaining Linus' glorious recitation of the Christmas Gospel of St. Luke, even though Bill Melendez, the animator/director was nervous that it might be considered ""too religious"" for network television.  Schulz's frank, firm response settled the issue once and for all, ""Bill, if we don't do it, who else can? We're the only ones that can do it.""  Thank goodness, he prevailed that soliloquy is the heart and soul of the special.

Schulz was also concerned that the simplicity and integrity of his comic strip characters be retained; he didn't want them elaborately animated or ""Disneyfied"".  Here Executive Producer Lee Mendelson and Animator/Director Bill Melendez stepped in making sure that Charlie Brown and Company would move and speak but remain as close as possible to their appearance in the strip, not be fleshed out and three dimensional with lots of detail.  The background settings were simply drawn and executed as well.

The third element was a memorable, beautifully executed musical score by renowned jazz musician Vince Guaraldi that perfectly caught the mood of the piece, enhancing the action and that has become a modern classic.  Besides the wonderful opening song ""Christmastime is Here"", the most renowned composition is ""Linus and Lucy"" which accompanies all the gang as they dance joyously on the stage of the school during the rehearsal for the Christmas pageant.  I have a fond memory myself of a company Christmas party about twenty years ago when a group of friends and myself were on the dance floor and the DJ played this cut, and someone shouted ""Hey, everyone dance like ""Peanuts""!"" and instantly we all started dancing like the different characters!  I took the part of the nameless boy with the spikey hair that turned to the right and left while shrugging his shoulders up and down.

Another important factor was that actual kids the approximate ages of the ""Peanuts"" gang were used to supply the voices.  this was quite refreshing, most times up to now adults had supplied the vocals for children in animation with the exception of the Disney films.  Having real children added immersurably to the authenticity and naturalness.  Kudos all round to this young group of actors but most especially to Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown, Christopher Shea as Linus, Tracy Stafford as Lucy and Kathy Steinburg as Sally Brown, who all captured the essence of their characters.  They were all  marvelous actors as well, particularly young Master Shea who brought a wellspring of emotion and depth of feeling to his recitation of the Nativity Gospel.  I can pay them no higher compliment than to say they sounded just the way I'd imagined their characters would.  The lone adult to lend his voice was Mr. Melendez who proved to be an inspired choice for the unique sound of Snoopy and later Woodstock as well.

One of my own personal reasons that this remains my favorite of all the ""Peanuts"" specials and movies is that it features the original characters from the first years of the strip:  Charlie Brown, Patty, Shermy, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, Linus, Pig-Pen and of course Snoopy. Regrettably, in a few years time Mr. Schulz would phase out Patty, Shermy, Violet and to a leser degree Pig-Pen, replacing them with Peppermint Patty, Marcy, Woodstock and Rerun whom I personally didn't find as amusing.

Now about the bonus featurette ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"".  It's a collection of several short vignettes that are all right I suppose, but don't measure to the high standard set by the original, and of course that's why you're buying this DVD.

There are many other reasons I love ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", along with ""Rudolph"" and ""The Grinch"",one being it is a touchstone to the Christmas' memories of my childhood, and more recently of my own son's.  Not to be hokey, but also I love that it does explain beautifully what Christmas is all about in it's purest essence, and this is an key fact to remember when one is overwhelmed by the sheer commercialism of the holiday.  Words somehow seen inadequate to describe it properly, sufficent to say you will laugh merrily, perhaps brush away a tear and feel all warm inside afterwards, don't miss it, either on television or on DVD!",1327449600,2,5830,4.924335378323108

589320,4,6303167314,"Like a lot of people, I grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on television when it was shown every year.  When I had the opportunity to purchase it on DVD back in 2000, it was a release I made sure to get.

Most people know the main story of this special, and about how Charlie Brown laments the commercialization of Chritstmas and how he tries to find the true meaning of the holiday.  One of things that has always stood out to me was the part where Linus was quoting Scripture.  It wasn't a common thing to do when this was produced in the 1960's, and this is definitely something that would not have been included if this special were being produced today.  Another thing that stands out for this special is the soundtrack composed by Vince Guaraldi.  When you hear a piece from this soundtrack, you recognize it instantly as a song from A Charlie Brown Christmas.  When it comes to Christmas specials, A Charlie Brown Christmas is the first one that immediately comes to mind.

This DVD edition that I have also comes with another Peanuts Christmas special called It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.  This particular special was produced in the 1980's, and it includes a series of vignettes instead of one overall story.  There are some amusing moments in this special, but it just can't hold a candle to A Charlie Brown Christmas.  There are no bonus features included on this release.

If you enjoy holiday specials and enjoy the Peanuts animation and strips, then A Charlie Brown Christmas should be part of your DVD library.

589321,5,6303167314,"A Charlie Brown Christmas is twenty-five minutes long and first aired on television on December 9, 1965. Basically it is Christmas time again and Charlie Brown is depressed because of all the commercialism going around. Even Snoopy is getting caught up in the commercialism by decorating his dog house and entering in contest for money. Charlie Brown stops by Lucy's psychiatric booth. After going through a list of phobias, she decides that Charlie Brown needs involvement and suggests to him that he direct the school play. Charlie Brown agrees and heads over to the school, but the Peanut gang is in no mood to cooperate and this upsets him. Lucy suggests taking Linus with him to get a bright shiny aluminum Christmas Tree to put the play in the right mood. Charlie Brown returns with a tree that looks a stick with a few twigs on it. The gang laugh at him saying can't you do anything right. At this point Charlie Browns yells out: doesn't anybody know the true meaning of Christmas. At this point Linus makes his famous speech:

""And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.""

At this point Charlie Brown picks up the tree and leaves. Charlie Brown on his way home passes by Snoopy's doghouse and sees that it has won first prize. Charlie Brown takes a Christmas oornament off the doghouse and put it on the tree. The weigh of the bulb is too much for the scrawny tree and the tree leans to the ground and Charlie Brown flee thinking he has killed the tree. Unknown to Charlie Brown the Peanut gang has followed behind and when they arrive add the rest to the decorations on the tree to make it look fuller. Charlie Brown returns and is amazed to see what has happen to his tree. In the end everybody sings Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. There is one on going goof towards the end of the special. The tree that Charlie Brown buys, the number of needles and branches on the tree keep changing from scene to scene. Overall it is a good holiday special. A Charlie Brown Christmas gets an AAA+++.

In on short Charlie Brown is trying to sell Christmas wreaths door to door. In another short Peppermint Patty worries about her Christmas book report. This happens all through the holiday special. After the original airing, It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown was aired a few more times and has not air since then. It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown with it lousy storyline gets a D-.

Instead, I would recommend that people stay away from this Blu-ray for one reason: the audio.

In an effort to create a 5.1 surround audio mix, the music in this special, perhaps some of the most well-known and most perfect ever created, sounds as if it were reprocessed into ""simulated stereo"" with a noticeable, horrible ""echo"" added behind the ""center"" channel used for the dialog.

As the disc does not provide an original mono track, there's no way to revert back to the original audio - even if you sum the channels in your preamp or receiver to create a mono track, the horrid ""echo"" in the music track persists.

If this disc were rereleased with a mono audio track option I'd say it's perfect; at present I'd recommend keeping your DVD copy. I'd have returned it to Amazon if I had known, and if I can save one person from buying this disc with this issue, it's a good thing.

""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is, hands down, the most wonderful Christmas special ever.  Period.  That fact makes this tepid attempt at a Blu-ray release all the more upsetting!  The one thing above all that really cheesed me off was that the touted ""digital copy"" IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MACS!!!!  How ridiculous is that?  The most ubiquitous device upon which you can load digital copies is the iPod; the iPod is a Macintosh product.  It stands to reason that digital copies would be compatible with Macs (as indeed every other digital copy I've ever experienced has been).  But NO, not with this one.  Preposterous.  The next thing that was upsetting was that the price you pay for this is far, far too high for the limited content.  By way of comparison, for one dollar more, we purchased the Star Trek movie (the new one) Blu-ray edition; it is a 3-disc special edition with over three hours of special features, plus a digital copy (that works on PC AND Macs!!!!).  With this, you get two discs; the episode in Blu-ray and a standard DVD of the episode; an additional crappy Peanuts Christmas special (truly awful), a 10 minute making-of featurette; and of course the useless digital copy.  THAT'S IT.  For $19.  RIP-OFF!!!  I have to believe that at some point, either the price will come way down or WB will release a proper Blu-ray execution of this Christmas classic.

The only complaint against this blu-ray release is that they could've fit all the holiday specials on one blu-ray disc.

589397,4,6303167314,"As with most of the PEANUTS episodes, we may find this more profound than we were expecting it to be.

Charlie Brown is sad because Christmas is coming up: ""I know no one likes me. Why do we need a holiday to emphasize it?"" Whether we are willing to admit this or not, Charlie Brown's attitude towards Christmas here is quite common. Lucy seems to be just a bit nicer in this episode. She offers to help Charlie Brown find involvement by having him direct a Christmas play.

From here, Charlie seems to get upset about the commercialized aspects of Christmas. (Even Sally wants $10.s and $20.s from Santa.) Later, we go to the play being rehearsed. Charlie feels that no one has the spirit of Christmas. (Though Charlie himself is not quite sure what it is.) The gang needs a tree, and Charlie and Linus go to get one. It is interesting that Linus all of a sudden backs Charlie's feelings: ""Christmas is not only getting too commercial, it's getting too dangerous."" They find a tree that looks on the frail side, but Charlie does not hesitate for a moment to pick it. It is interesting that Linus DOES NOT rebuke Charlie for his choice, but he DOES WARN Charlie that his choice may not be appreciated.

(In other words, 'You're doing a nice thing, but don't expect to be popular for it.')

Naturally, Charlie is mocked and scorned for his compassion rooted choice. At this point, Linus reveals the true meaning of Christmas. (A fragment of ""Luke"" 2:1-20 which is usually used for the Christmas mass.) This is when the gang starts to realize that Charlie did a wonderful thing (showing compassion) that kept with the spirit of Christmas.

My one slight complaint is that a comment Linus makes at the start seems inconsistent with his character: ""Charlie Brown, you're the only one I know who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem."" Throughout the episode, Linus seems aware that Christmas has become too commercialized and in some ways has gotten dangerous. To say nothing of the true meaning being lost, and someone may be scorned (as Charlie Brown was) for trying to uphold the true meaning of Christmas.",1232496000,4,2137,4.657824933687003

It's nice to watch this show and be carried away not only to a place that has more Christmas-like weather, but also to nice memories of Christmas past.

I also like the fact that they weren't afraid to mention the word ""Christmas"" as well as have Linus recite the verses pertaining to the birth of Jesus.

589436,3,6303167314,"Maybe the reason Charlie Brown was feeling depressed around Christmas was because he saw this DVD. While I'd give ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" 6 stars if I could for the show itself, the poor quality DVD that's on the market is another story: it rates 2 stars at best. Surely a program that's so loved by so many deserves the TLC of a proper remastering, and it's hard to understand why it hasn't happened.

This year I bought my three favorite Christmas classics on DVD: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Charlie Brown. The first two were recently remastered and the results were stunning--better in every way than I've ever seen them look and sound on television. And I'm not talking about a ""modernizing"" of these shows that turned them into something different in character than they were--no, these remasters are loving and faithful restorations of these classics to their original glory. By comparison, A Charlie Brown Christmas was a huge disappointment. The video is passable, but having seen what restoration did for the Grinch animation, I'm also aware of how much better the Charlie Brown video could be. The audio, however, is atrocious--an embarrassment, really, especially considering all the great Charles Schulz dialogue and the incomparable Vince Guaraldi score. It's hissy, it's muddy, it's mixed poorly and sound levels can vary widely.

The size of the fan base for this show would virtually guarantee financial success for a remastered DVD-I'm not sure who owns the rights to do something like that, but I hope they're reading this review!",1198540800,7,1592,5.0494296577946765

589440,5,6303167314,"I enjoy Mhdi""Christmas Treasures"",Josh Groban ,Mannheim Steamroller etc.and this a magnificent production that I also enjoy just as much. The first prime-time Peanuts special introduced Charles M. Schulz's timeless gang to the world of television and was awarded both an Emmy and a Peabody award. Originally broadcast December 9, 1965, on CBS -- years before Seasonal Affective Disorder entered our lexicon -- the story is driven by Charlie Brown, sort of a tyro Scrooge made even more miserable by the increasingly crass commercialism of holiday cheer. Charlie agrees to direct the school Christmas pageant and in the process tries to discover the true meaning of the holiday. Although its animation is dated and its evangelism is unsubtle, A Charlie Brown Christmas -- like all the Peanuts holiday specials -- is so good-hearted that it's very easy to overlook its flaws. Linus wrapping his blanket around the tiny, stunted tree remains among the most endearing images ever produced for network television. For grown-ups, this is how Charlie Brown and Snoopy and Sally will always be remembered, stumbling and dancing around the school stage in a childish torrent of goodwill. For kids, the simple charm of the white beagle with black ears and his friends will likely beguile them from here to next Tuesday. The new DVD is unedited and includes footage that was shorn after the initial broadcast, as well as the more recent special, It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.

Charles Schultz's characters are winners. It's no wonder they've been charming us all since the 1950's.

It's about a babe in a manger, three wise men and eternal salvation. In an innocent way only Charles Shultz and the crew can do, Charlie Brown (And Linus, et al) deliver this message loud and clear. I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world... It's sad when a cartoon such as this may very well be one of the last strongholds Christians have on our own identity.

My own personal soapbox aside, this movie is great. It's timely, even today. It's meaningful and it's truth personified. It teaches about the things that really matter in life, not the superficial garbage most people tend to worry about during the holidays.

589455,5,6303167314,"As every die hard Peanuts fan knows, when A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS first premiered in 1965, CBS was absolutely certain the show would be a disaster for several reasons.  First, unlike other cartoons at the time, there was no laugh track.  The characters were all voiced by actual children (save for producer and director Bill Melendez, who voiced Snoopy), and of those children, only two had previous acting experience.  The music for the show was a jazz soundtrack, atypical of children's programming at the time.  And since TV and music executives were very touchy at the time about having God's name even mentioned, CBS despised the idea of Linus reciting his famous speech of ""what Christmas is all about"" from the King James Version of the Bible.  Also, even though Peanuts was already one of the most popular comic strips in America by 1965, history had shown the success rate of adapting comic strips to the small screen was hit-or-miss.  All these aspects, combined with the decidedly choppy animation and poorly enunciated vocal track, prepared CBS for a total flop.  Which, of course, A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS was not.

The special could be considered an example of a show that succeeds in spite of itself.  But then again, as has been pointed out many times before, the shortcomings with the animation and vocal track work to the overall show's benefit, making the overall theme of the true meaning of Christmas resonate even more.  This is also due in part to the decision to focus on the plot rather than the characters.  While all of the characters stand out in some form or fashion- especially Charlie Brown, the character wrapped around the true meaning of Christmas theme- it's the plot that is the main attraction here, and it's the reason why the show is not just one of the best Christmas shows ever made, it's a timeless classic.  The loose plot of the story- which is pretty much several little stories weaved together- as well as Vince Guaraldi's wonderful jazz soundtrack contribute just as much, if not more, to A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS's influence.  This was the show that put the Peanuts characters onto the small screen periodically for the next 25 years, and even though a fair share of excellent specials were created, none of them could quite match the innocent charm of this masterpiece.

[This 2000 DVD edition marked the first time A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS was released on DVD.  Of course, no remastering will change the quality of the animation, but the picture is very good, and the music has never been better presented than it is here.  The only bonus feature on the DVD is the 1992 Christmas special IT'S CHRISTMASTIME AGAIN, CHARLIE BROWN, which is a very different beast than A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS.  Watching the feature once, it's easy to see why it's often been criticized- true, the several small stories featured are merely thrown into the show, not unlike how A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS was created, but here, the small stories are not tied together at all, making for a very herky-jerky viewing.  (If you want more information about the special, see my VHS review of the special.)  Nevertheless, this DVD is an excellent way of getting A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS, but if you have a little extra money, a better recommendation is the PEANUTS HOLIDAY COLLECTION, which also includes IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN and A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING, two of the better Peanuts specials.]",1178755200,3,3442,4.873070325900515

589489,5,6303167314,"Sometimes...many times...I get lost in the craziness of the world. As much as I try and remain centered in a place/a space of Spirit, there are times where I just temporarily forget the Love, the life, the Light that is within me and all around me and I start believing more in the appearances than in what's ultimately real; God. And I can tell when I do. I start feeling heavy. Not just physically, but emotionally. I get grouchy. I find myself getting irritated at the littlest of things and then before I spiral too much out of control, I look for something that helps me remember a deeper meaning to life and a lot of the time I reach for this beautiful and wonderful Holy-day classic.

This movie is as old as I am. Actually, I am older by 9 months and nine days (but who's counting)and I really cannot recall the first time I saw it, but I do know that even now when I see it, something magical...something transformative...something wondrous takes place within me. Not just now, now that I am on a conscious and deliberate spiritual path, but always - which can only lead me to conclude that I was on a Spiritual Path even when I thought I wasn't.

Charlie Brown finds out the deeper meaning of Christmas and maybe he finds a deeper meaning to life; that appearances are not always what they seem; that through Love, transformation always takes place. When people ask me if I'm ""born again"" I tell them ""sure"". Not in the way that they might think, but I am born again every time I believe in what my heart says more than what the world may tell me. This is why I reach for this film no matter what time of year I may be in. I am reminded of the simple beauty and innocence of Jesus the Christ's teachings; ""Be in the world, but not of it..."" and ""Forgive them, for they know not what they do...""

So many times we know not what we do. We have become so hypnotized into believing in the world that we forget our true identity, our true home. Blessed now are we the children of God and it is this God of Love in which we live and move and have all of our being just as this Love lives within us, moves with us, and has all of its being within us, as us.

Y'see, it matters not how old something may be or how many times you think you might have seen something, if you're always gettting something wonderful out of something, then it is still a valid part of your life. That is why I am reviewing this classic in February. Christmas is not a once-a-year thing; whenever the innocence of Christ is being renewed in your heart, the ""savior"" is being born. Be humble enough to receive Its Love, and gracious enough to carry it out into the world.

Peace and Blessings be to you and yours this Holy-day!",1171152000,3,2705,4.275390625

But the fact of the matter is that this is the kind of cartoon that doesn't get made anymore. Now it's all about the trash-talkin' Simpsons and their moronic kind. Also, because God plays a part in the message of this Christmas special, it could not be made today. It might offend believers in Allah, or hurt the sensitive feelings of atheists.

Both the main feature, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and the bonus ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"" are destined to be viewed at Yuletide for many more decades to come.  As one among the very many people in my social circle who bemoan the loss of the true meaning of Christmas and with the wanton commercialisation behind it all, I was pleasantly surprised to see a couple of cartoons that address this issue so well and in such simple terms that even a child could understand the distinction.  The main feature brings out the message better than the bonus and it's no surprise at all that this is a very worthy winner of both the Emmy and Peabody awards.  The only reason this dvd doesn't get all 5 stars from me is that despite the digital remastering, the sound quality isn't perfect and is in mono format and the video quality is affected by transfer from a deteriorating master source.  But these are small complaints and do not detract too much from the enjoyment of all but the more picky video and audiophile.  I note that they have attempted to do a better remastering for the Grinch and perhaps those concerned may attempt something similar with this dvd as well.

589529,5,6303167314,"Everybody gets that feeling -- the disillusionment with Christmas' glitzy, soulless commercial barrage.

The antidote to that can be found in  ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" where everyone's favorite round-headed kid tries to find out the real meaning of Christmas. Simply animated and told, this special little story reminds us why we have Christmas, without resorting to sentimental goop or silly humor. It's both funny and heartwarming.

Charlie Brown is depressed. It's Christmastime, and he knows he should be happy, but instead he feels let down. Even worse, everyone is into the commercial aspect of it -- even his dog! When he asks Lucy for help, she offers him a job as a pageant director. He agrees, hoping it will get him in the spirit.

Of course, it's a disaster -- Snoopy mimicks and licks Lucy, Pigpen grosses out his onstage ""wife,"" and everyone dances to Schroeder's piano. Finally Charlie Brown goes out to buy a big glitzy Christmas tree, but he ends up buying a tiny scraggly one instead. As the others laugh at him and his poor little tree, he cries out, ""Isn't there ANYONE who can tell me what Christmas is all about?"" And Linus tells him.

This DVD also contains a sequel special, ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown."" Instead of a real storyline, it's a series of light subplots and vignettes, based on the comic strips by Charles Schultz. It's not as striking as the original, but it is lots of fun.

As the story goes on, Peppermint Patty struggles with her holiday book reports, and Linus tries unsuccessfully to tell Sally about the meaning of Christmas. Charlie Brown tries unsuccessfully to peddle wreaths door to door (""It isn't even Thanksgiving yet!""), and sells his comic book collection so he can buy his crush a pretty pair of gloves.

And finally, there's an upcoming holiday pageant -- Sally has been cast as an angel, with only a one-word line: ""Hark!"" She messes up, of course. And Peppermint Patty hopes to be cast in the role of Mary, but is shocked to find out that Marcie has been cast instead (""Mary never wore GLASSES!"")... and that she's gotten the role of a sheep.

""Charlie Brown Christmas"" is sort of an antidote to those wretched Christmas specials they trot out every year . It was made with a shoestring budget and a jazz soundtrack, and after seeing it, the network executives believed it would be a massive flop. Well, shows what they knew.

There's something in Charlie Brown's search for yuletide meaning that really yanks the heartstrings. Not to mention the climactic moment when Charlie Brown cries out for the meaning of Christmas -- Linus calmly announces that he can tell him. He goes up to the podium, and quietly reads from a relevant Bible passage. ""Fear not, for behold, I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."" Its simplicity is what makes it so beautiful.

But there's lots of humor too -- birds dancing with candy canes, Sally's Christmas demands, and disastrous holiday pageants (""Woof! Meow! Moo! Whatever!"" yells Peppermint Patty in her sheep costume). One of the most entertaining subplots is poor Linus repeatedly trying to tell Sally about the meaning of Christmas, only to have her say angrily, ""If I get socks again for Christmas, I'll get even MORE crazy!""

Whether it's for the nostalgic value or the message, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is sure to entertain. An absolute must-have.",1164499200,8,3402,4.838209982788296

589577,5,6303167314,"Coming from England, I'd never heard of this movie, though I always enjoyed reading the Peanuts comic strips whenever I came across them. After moving to the US and hearing so much about it from my friends I decided to buy it for myself to see what all the fuss was about.

In short, I loved it! It is the most heartwarming and poignant little Christmas story I have ever seen, and I can understand why it stirs such warm memories in my friends, most of whom are in the 25-35 year old age category. The colours are bright and vivid, and the music is incredibly apt while still being jolly. The early scene where Charlie Brown is standing at the window looking out at the falling snow, while the piano theme plays in the background simply makes you feel better just for having seen it!

I suppose it brings back childhood memories for us all, the happiest of which we selectively retain. It was great to be young an innocent, and to have lots of friends, and just enjoy the simplicity of playing in the snow. Charles Schultz knew this, and it permeates all his cartoons - as does his inherent warmth and good naturedness.

If you have children, buy this for yourself then pretend it was for them! For my part, I oringinally intended to watch this every Christmastime. Now I just watch it whenever I need cheering up.

Granted it is only 25 minutes long, and the sequel is pretty weak sadly, but anything that makes you feel this good is money well spent. Don't hesitate, just buy it!!!!",1146009600,5,1485,4.448529411764706

589584,5,6303167314,"Charles Schulz's Peanuts gang deliver the true meaning of Christmas in this 1965 Holiday Classic beloved by millions! Charlie Brown is more depressed than usual now that Christmas is in the air, and he really doesn't know why. It soon becomes clear that his problem is the commercialization of the sacred holiday. A visit to Lucy's psychiatry stand lands him in the director's chair of their school's upcoming Christmas pageant, but the lack of respect he gets from his cast and crew does little to cheer him up. Lucy's next suggestion is that he take a break to purchase a Christmas tree for the show, but Charlie Brown's selection of a scrawny twig of a tree instead of a gaudy aluminum one only makes things worse. Luckily, a recitation by Linus of the Christmas story from the Bible brings the Peanuts gang around to Charlie Brown's way of thinking. The little tree finally gets the love it needs, and Charlie Brown gets renewed faith in the spirit of the season!

Of all the holiday movies and specials ever to grace the television screen, this is the one no Christmas lover wants to miss! This is the great one, the masterpiece, the tradition of traditions: ""A Charlie Brown Christmas."" Amidst all the Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Clauses, the Pac-Man Christmas Specials, the ten-million versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" (don't get me wrong, I love `em all!), this simple holiday favorite IS the diamond in the rough. It's no wonder why the Peanuts have been so successful on TV since this wonderful program first hit the air waves. ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is a must have on DVD, and this edition even includes an entire program as a bonus feature! ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown,"" is one of 3 Peanuts Christmas programs made after the 1965 original. It's a standard 23 minute special, but it is more a collection of comic strip style gags than a solid story. Likely taken directly from one year's holiday run of the actual Peanuts strip, the short jokes are funny and do reflect the holiday season (Charlie Brown is trying to sell Christmas wreaths door-to-door to buy a Christmas gift for his girlfriend, Snoopy is a Salvation Army Santa Claus, Peppermint Patty is upset about her role in a Christmas Pageant, etc...). However, the special doesn't have nearly as much charm or Christmas spirit as the classic special. Fine as a time-killer, but nothing too memorable. Still, a very nice bonus feature on a very nice disc.

Those other two Peanuts Christmas specials I mentioned are available on the ""I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown"" DVD. The disc includes the doubly-long special the DVD is named for, plus the shorter ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales."" Both are similar to ""It's Christmas Time Again, Charlie Brown"" in structure, but the longer story (Dog For Christmas) does have the running theme of Lucy and Linus's little brother Rerun's quest to get a dog. ""I Want a Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown"" is sweet and charming, and features Snoopy's brother, Spike, in a major role. It's still no ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" but I found it enjoyable on television this past Christmas and it's definitely been added to my wish list. ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales"" is pretty much on the same level as ""It's Christmas Time Again, Charlie Brown."" Oddly enough, this disc also has the bonus feature of ""The Making of A Charlie Brown Christmas!"" Yes, that's the making of the original Christmas classic reviewed here! So, if you enjoy ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and want to see a featurette on how it was made, you'll have to pick up the ""I Want a Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown"" DVD as well. Don't worry, it's well worth the low price and will provide you with great Peanuts holiday entertainment for years to come!",1136851200,,3745,4.795665634674923

I could never hook up in the clubs because I couldn't dance. All the girls would be out on the floor with fellows who could cut a rug. Meanwhile I would be sitting lonely at the bar. Well no more!!!

After watching this film I finally learned how to not only dance, but cut moves that no one thought imaginable! First you get the 'Frankenstein'. Remember the kid you holds his arms out in front of him and just walks in place? Bust that move at the club and be flocked by women, and copied by posers. If that ain't enough, just bop your head from shoulder to shoulder like the little girl does. I'm here to say that after you do the 'Peanuts Dance', you get play.",1135728000,,835,4.2784810126582276
589586,3,6303167314,"This is one of the most wonderful programs ever put on TV.  However, the DVD has some very disappointing sound problems that make me hope that this treasure has not been lost forever, and that maybe there is a better version in our future.

The program, particularly the audio, seems like it has been poorly ""restored.""  However that restoration is more like amateurish remodeling.  Old programs are always a little scratchy sounding.  That's OK.  However, when an bad effort is made to hide that fact, it can spoil the program.  Here is what you get in many instances in this DVD, to distacting annoyance:

The children are speaking, with soft jazz music in the background.  Where there is a moment without a syllable, the sound level drops, like the volume was turned down for just that moment.  Not only does this suck the atmosphere out of the program, and generate noticable odd silent spots in a program with acceptable old fashioned tape hiss at all other moments, but it spoils the wonderful musical background, making it go quiet when you are supposed to hear it.  This occurs throughout the program.

Less of a concern is that there are a few ""glitches"" where several frames seem to be lost, which is jarring, especially when the music jumps.  Also, at the end, the final credits music awkwardly fades out before it is over.  I understand that there had been a commercial logo originally that they did not want to include, but they should have let the music continue.  Perhaps someone just chopped it off of the print, and the fade is to avoid the chop.

I hope that somewhere there is a better print to work with, so that the full joy of this program can be savored.

Until then, I'll enjoy the wonderful Vince Guaraldi music on the CD, which has excellent sound quality.",1135123200,134,1782,4.642172523961661
589587,5,6303167314,"What more can one say about this perfect Christmas perennial?  Quite often, growing up with annually televised programs can affect a person's critique of the show, with personal feelings becoming involved in the remembrances of the actual quality of the work.  Not with this one baby!  ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is quality going all the way, from the calm, cool opening with the Peanuts gang skating to Vince Guaraldi's inspired score, the amazing on-target commentaries regarding commercialism, through the incredibly relevant and moving moment when Linus tells Charlie Brown (and all of us) the true ""meaning"" of Christmas.  It amazes me whenever I experience that scene over and over again and my reaction to it never changes.  Could we ever imagine, in today's ""politically correct"", and so much more ""enlightened"" era, having a cartoon character reciting a religious passage in an animated holiday special.....and all without any kind of  preaching or forcing it down ones throat?  I'm surprised TV networks can even televise it without editing what might be ""offensive"" to certain members of the audience.

589588,4,6303167314,"This DVD is a Christmas Classic that should be experienced again and again every season.  Charlie Brown's angst about the Christmas season is profound, but it's gotten even worse forty years later.  The interesting thing about his troubles with the holiday season is that Schultz treats it with such tenderness while keeping a biting commentary on it in the process.  That's hard to pull off.

The only thing that can be said about negative aspects of this fun little short is that the animation is starting to look jerky and dated.  However, when it comes down to it, it's not like anyone should care.

This DVD also includes It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown!, a follow-up short made in the 90s.  It's not as good, nor as relevant, but it's still sweet and hey, it has Snoopy.  Snoopy always makes everything go from good to great.  The animation is a bit improved but not enough to really be focused upon.  All in all it's just a nice addition if you want to sit down and enjoy a back-to-back showing.

589589,4,6303167314,"How anyone could not love ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is beyond comprehension? It's been part of my childhood memories since it first aired in 1965. Seeing it again forty years later, I am still impressed by how Charles Schultz combined character-driven humor, holiday-related poignancy and Vince Guaraldi's memorable music into such a nostalgic jewel. What strikes me more now is the number of religious references Schultz made unobtrusively within the theme of the cartoon - how to deal with the increasing commercial exploitation of Christmas. The plot revolves around Charlie Brown's duties as the director of the school's Christmas play as a means to divulge the true meaning of Christmas. I still love the tableaux shot of all the children dancing in a mid-1960's beatnik style.

Needless to say, he is surrounded by the cynicism of his schoolmates, and it all comes to a head when Charlie Brown buys a sad little tree as the centerpiece of the play. His best friend Linus articulates the meaning of Christmas by quoting Luke 2:8-14 from the King James translation of the Bible. At the end, everyone gathers around the tree (given new life by using the decorations Snoopy uses to win 1st prize in the doghouse decoration contest) and sings ""Hark! The Herald Angel Sings"". Because the cartoon focuses on Charlie Brown's singular journey, the message has a sweetly-turned resonance that remains touching to this day. It's a timeless must-see for any child or adult.

The same really can't be said for the second cartoon included in the DVD, 1992's ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"". Twenty-seven years later, most of the gang is back in what amounts to a series of vignettes about Christmas, but because Charlie Brown is only one of the characters whose holiday dilemmas are addressed here, it feels more like a hodgepodge of comedy bits - some funny, some rather tired. The other sad inevitable fact is that the voices are different, a point of discontinuity that feels a bit jarring when seeing the cartoons sequentially. I also miss some of the original characters like Pig-Pen and Beethoven-playing Schroeder and frankly don't find some of their replacements as likeable.

Charlie Brown's only challenge this time is being able to afford a pair of gloves for his crush Peggy Jean. It appears that Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown's little sister Sally are the ones trying to find the meaning of Christmas this time with many of the other characters (like Lucy and even Snoopy) relegated to small bits. The familiarity of the characters and Guaraldi's music, however, still make this one leagues better than similar children's programming. The combination of the original classic and this derivative makes for superior viewing.",1134691200,4,2744,5.0798226164079825
589590,5,6303167314,"I've watched 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' literally ever since I was born. Charlie Brown's disgust at the commercialization of Christmas is ever more relevant---never mind that the show was originally produced in the 1960's.

I could always relate to Charlie Brown. He is a nice guy who really tries hard to do the right thing--but is underappreciated by his classmates just for being himself. His really big heart prompts a tree rescue and philosophical search for holiday meaning, itself a pretty admirable task for an animated special which could have done a less ambitious script.

Linus's school auditorium speech is supposed to get audiences in the show--and at home--thinking about the non-commercial side of Christmas. Christmas should not be about how much stuff you have, but what you can do for others. Again, this is a timeless message which easily transcends the original airdate and many perspectives who celebrate this holiday.",1133913600,5,941,5.225165562913907
589591,5,6303167314,"With Christmas coming to Peanuts-land, Charlie Brown suffers from holiday angst. The commercialism of the season, a mailbox always lacking Christmas cards and his little sister's monetary demands to Santa make Chuck wonder if Christmas is really something to anticipate. Unable to get any good advice from a therapy session with Lucy, Charlie Brown seems destined to be miserable through the holidays. Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, he is indeed the Charlie Browniest.

To cheer him up, the gang puts Charlie Brown in charge of a very weird Christmas pageant that features a Christmas Queen, Beethoven music, a few people dressed as nativity characters and a stage full of dancers doing the same dance steps over and over and over. But Orson Welles he is not, and Chuck fails as a director.

His pals give him one last chance to redeem himself by putting him in charge of procuring a Christmas tree. It is at this moment that the show makes a drastic switch in tone and ambition. The opening acts are full of silly set-ups and easy jokes. But as Chuck and his faithful pal Linus set out toward the Christmas tree lot, the narrative slows and strives for poignancy.

The perpetually needle-shedding little tree they obtain and Linus's eventual speech on the true meaning of Christmas have become iconic moments for the holiday season. Linus himself seems to guide the last half of the show, as the baby-faced blankie-wielding introvert swoops in and steals Charlie Brown's Christmas special from him. Linus sees the potential for greatness in the little tree, believing it only needs some love. Indeed, the eternal optimism and right-mindedness of Charlie Brown's best friend transforms the show from a gloomy diatribe against modern Christmas to a declaration on the potential for beauty and wonder to blossom everywhere during the Christmas season.",1133308800,7,1858,5.006472491909385

Even though it was written in the 60's, it is amazing how resonating a story about the over commercialization of Christmas still is today. From the tin Christmas trees to Linus thinking that the holiday is run by an ""eastern syndicate"", you could use these kind of things to apply to today (attention wal-mart shoppers). Though far from being a religious person, I still love Linus' speech about the true meaning of Christmas and it is interesting to learn the advertisers back in the day worried the cartoon was too religious for the viewing audience.

589594,5,6303167314,"I have been a PEANUTS fan practically since I first learned to read (around the age of 2, if my late mother's oft-retold story is to be believed). I alternated as a kid identifying the most with poor, picked-on, stumble-plagued Charlie Brown and bookish, thoughtful, sibling-harassed Linus van Pelt. In the wrong hands, animating these beloved characters (quite possibly the greatest ever created for a comic strip) for the first time could have been disastrous. God must surely have guided ""Sparky"" Schulz to the gentle-hearted animation team of Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelsohn, who gave his creation the care and love it deserved; and them, in turn, to jazz great Vince Guaraldi for his inspired musical score (where do you think that famous PEANUTS theme music -- ""Linus & Lucy"" -- first came from?).

Read Mendelsohn's out-of-print 1970 book, CHARLIE BROWN & CHARLIE SCHULZ, or the more recent A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS anniversary-edition book for the full story behind the making of this timeless classic -- and the tremendous risks they took in making it the way they did and airing it that first time on CBS in 1965. You'll appreciate its magic, humor and warmth all the more when you know how perilously close it came to not being made or aired at all, or only in a network-suit-approved bowdlerization -- or worse, bombing in the Nielsen ratings and preventing the making of all the specials, feature films and even Broadway musicals (!) that followed.

All the silliness and the sentimentality only serve to make it more of an enduring treasure. And that powerful, climactic moment, when the gang's resident philosopher, Linus (what an utterly fitting choice!), schools poor lost Charlie Brown and friends -- and all of us -- on the real reason for the season, with that sweet, simple reading of a few lines from the King James Gospel of Luke, can still move even a jaded, bitter ""recovering Catholic"" like me to tears. It remains the finest artistic rebuke to the ever-worsening commercialization of the Christian calendar's second-holiest day since Stan Freberg's edgier, more satirical audio recording ""Green Chri$tma$"" of a decade earlier (and sadly, both are even more relevant today than they were back then).

If only poor Mr. Schulz could have lived to see his baby reach this milestone anniversary. It consoles me to know that, at the end of his life, all the cards, letters and E-mails he got in hospital surely made him realize that he had created something for the ages, to last well beyond his own lifetime.

589629,5,6303167314,"Charles Schultz cast the gold standard of annual holiday classics with his 1965 creation of A Charlie Christmas. This animated, made-for-TV special features all the familiar Peanuts characters (although I've always wondered why the comic strip was titled Peanuts and not Charlie Brown?) - Lucy, Snoopy, Schroeder, Linus, Sally, Pig-pen, and Woodstock all make appearances. But the enduring popularity of this classic stems not from its storyline, but its invocation of childhood nostalgia and memorable Christmas music (everyone on earth has heard the song the characters sing in the closing credits).

For those who need refreshing (because I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it), A Charlie Brown Christmas covers title character Charlie Brown's search for the true meaning of Christmas. When neighborhood friend Lucy dispenses her usual five cent advice, she encourages Charlie Brown to take on the job of director in the school Christmas play. But none of the other kids take their new director seriously, and when Charlie Brown passes over several Christmas trees which he believes embody the commercial exploitation of Christmas (and brings back a sagging relic of branch instead), the other kids fire him as director. Meanwhile, Snoopy is involved in decorating his doghouse with colorful flashing lights and other knick-knacks in an effort to win 1st Prize in a Christmas decorating contest. In the end, the other kids feel they've been too hard on Charlie Brown, and fix up his tree into a brilliant display Christmas beauty. Linus reveals the true meaning of Christmas by retelling a segment from the Gospels that recounts the story Jesus Christ's birth. Charlie Brown is finally happy and everyone sings Christmas carols.

One of the better parts of this TV special is when Charlie Brown goes hunting for a Christmas tree. Some of the trees are aluminum, which you rarely see today (especially those trees with the rotating colored lights underneath). Simply put, A Charlie Brown Christmas is a breath of fresh air - a thoughtful, funny, and highly entertaining show that the whole family can enjoy together. Parents and children are connected by the shared experience of this annual holiday affair, and parents don't have to worry about their children being exposed to a Janet Jackson ""costume malfunction""!

589630,4,6303167314,"Even though this TV is now almost 40 years old, it has surely stood the test of time and is still relevant today. Basically, Charlie Brown is upset that Xmas has become too commercialised. He wants to enjoy it but can't because of the shallow, money-grabbing opportunity he sees all around him.

The gang try to cheer him up by letting them direct their Xmas play. He finds it a major stain at first but soon finds it easy being an artistic tyrant. But they need an Xmas tree and the only one Charlie can afford is practically a twig. It needs a lot of love, which the gang sure do give it.

Also this TV special also features something damn rare in Xmas movies these days; an actual dedication to Jesus. Now, I am not a puritan Christian but there are sooooo many movies that try to find the TRUE meaning of Xmas but none ever mention the birth of Jesus. Weird eh? Definitely one of the better Xmas specials and miles better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Magoo-s-Christmas-Carol/dp/B000R7G6K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol</a>&nbsp;or Denver the Last Dinosaur Saves Santa.

As for It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown when compared to the original this special seems to be less social commentary and more an excuse for gags. It's more cartoonish and has more obvious laughs rather than any irony or important things to say.

There's another Xmas play in this 'un. Peppermint Patty is refusing to do any homework and is annoyed that Marcie is playing Mary and she is left with the thankless role of a sheep. Still, she's determined to steal as much scenery as possible. Charlie Brown is selling his old comics to buy an Xmas present for his wannabe girlfriend and his sister Sally has only one word to say in the play 'HARK' but she ends up yelling 'HOCKEY STICK' instead.

More like a series of Peanuts vignettes than a real TV special. But still nice.

589668,5,6303167314,"""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" first aired on CBS in December 1965 (""brought to you by Dolly Madison and the people in your town who bottle Coca-Cola""), and has been revived every year since, most recently on ABC. Even so, this charming animated classic exudes such warmth and genuine holiday spirit that it deserves a permanent place in the collection of anyone who values the true meaning of Christmas and the late Charles M. Schulz's all too human ""Peanuts"" characters.

Schulz once said that his legendary comic strip was never intended for children, and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" may hold greater meaning for adults, especially those who remember it from their childhood. Who can't relate to Charlie Brown and his inability to find joy in the season proclaimed by everyone as the happiest of all? Today, he would likely be diagnosed with SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and put on Prozac to prevent him from wondering what Christmas is all about.

But Charles Schulz was wiser than any psychologist, and he recognized Charlie's depression for what it is: a yearning to know life's deeper meaning. He finds it through Linus who shares with him ""the tidings of great joy"" found in Luke 2:10-11. It's a beautiful moment that may explain why this classic remains so beloved in our increasingly secular, cynical world.

But there's a lot to love about ""A Charlie Brown Christmas."" The child actors who voice Charlie Brown (Peter Robbins), Linus (Christopher Shea) and the entire Peanuts gang capture the personalities superbly, Snoopy is at his radical best, and then there's Vince Guaraldi's jazz score, a jewel of perfection that features the beautiful ""Christmas Time Is Here.""

It's been said that art can heal. There's no better proof of that than the work of Charles M. Schulz whose simple drawings combined with a profound understanding of human nature made him one of the greatest healers of all.

She absolutely adores it, so even though it's summer - it's Christmas with the Peanuts gang in our house!

589670,5,6303167314,"I realize that I am writing this several weeks after Christmas, and this is a Christmas DVD, but this is the first year that I missed watching ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" on television, so I rented the DVD.  Ever since I was a little boy, this has been my favorite Christmas special, and one that I always looked forward to watching every year.  I grew up reading the Peanuts comic strips and I grew up watching the Peanuts Christmas special.
Charlie Brown is depressed.  He can't seem to get himself into the Christmas spirit.  He doesn't like the commercialism of Christmas and scarcely knows the true meaning of Christmas.  Lucy selects Charlie Brown to be the director of their Christmas play and he decides to get a Christmas tree for the production.  The other kids tell him to get a ""nice shiny aluminum tree, maybe a pink one"", but Charlie Brown and Linus bring back a sad looking real tree.  Charlie Brown is almost laughed out of the auditorium, but when he asks if anyone knows what Christmas is all about, Linus has the answer.  Linus recites a passage from the Bible telling of the birth of Jesus.  Charlie Brown is cheered and leaves with the tree.  He tries to decorate the little tree, but even that is ruined.  Linus and the gang follow behind, fix up the tree, and at the end, they show the true spirit of Christmas.
It is a sweet little Christmas special, filled with memorable moments that will always make me smile.  The one thing that amazes me is that Charles Schulz was able to include Linus's speech near the end about the birth of Jesus.  I don't imagine that would have been able to be included today, but I think the special is all the stronger for it.  I have a hard time imagining that any new Christmas show will ever hold as special a place in my heart as ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"".
This DVD also includes ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"" (1992).  This Christmas feature is lacking the overall charm and emotion of the older special, but it has a lot more humor.  It is also different from the first Christmas special in that this one is more a series of vignettes (perhaps based on Schulz's comic strips) than a complete story.  There are sequences with Charlie Brown trying to sell Christmas wreaths before Thanksgiving, and of Sally rehearsing for a Christmas play.  Sally's sole line is ""Hark!"", though I think she missed the rest of her lines where the herald angels sing.  It is a cute cartoon, but ultimately it does not quite live up to ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", but it my mind, nothing can live up to that one.",1074038400,88,2565,4.53695652173913

589672,5,6303167314,"A TRUE Christmas classic.  There are lots of great Christmas movies and TV shows that are fun to watch each year, from CHRISTMAS VACATION to THE GRINCH.  But there is something special about Charlie Brown's take.
First of all, it's the only mainstream Christmas classic that actually DARES to bring the story of the birth of Jesus to front and center!! When Linus takes centerstage and quotes the bible for us, you can almost feel the air suck out of the room. It's a moment of simple drama that can really bring a tear to your eye. Linus, without saying a harsh word, essentially tells everyone to ""shut up and remember the meaning of this holiday!""  It's a beautiful moment.
There's plenty of amusing stuff too. The pitiful tree...Snoopy's hijinks, etc. It's not laugh out loud funny, of course, but sweet and innocent.  These are kids who live in a world without adults...and don't seem to need them either!  It's always a nice 22 minute trip down memory lane. Every adult should own this...if only to take minute to journey back to childhood.  And kids need to keep seeing this. I'm glad it has remained a classic.
The animation is no great shakes, of course, but the style is executed marvelously.  The voice acting, on the other hand, leaves nothing to be desired. The kids involved have done a terrific job.  The music, ever present, is great, as we've come to expect from any Peanuts special. All in all, this is a MUST OWN DVD.

For almost forty years, watching ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" has been an eagerly anticipated event for millions of households.  I recall watching it as far back as twenty-two years ago, and have watched it every Christmas since.
""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" was made in a time when commercialism was running rampant all over the country.  Stores advertising to shoppers what they ought to buy, long before Thanksgiving had come and gone.  Unfortunately, we still see this blatant commercialism today, which makes this short film so very poignant and all the more special.
Charlie Brown is assigned to direct the school Christmas pageant, much to his glee; for he feels accepted and worthy.  When Lucy tells him to go out and get an alumminum tree, he takes Linus along with him.  What Charlie Brown ultimately gets is a small, sickly looking tree, which is rapidly loosing its needles.  But, Charlie can see how much the tree ""needs him"", somebody; something which he can identity with.
When he returns, he finds the gang dancing to un-Christmas like music, instead of rehearsing their lines.  They stop to take a look at the tree he brought, immediately burtsing out in mocking laughter.  Apparently Charlie Brown has failed again.  In disgust and humiliation he flees, taking the tree with him.  And when he comes upon Snoopy's dog house, all decked out in Christmas lights, not to celebrate the joyous holiday, but to win money in a contest, Charlie Brown has had enough, and almost loses all faith in Christmas.
Linus saves the day, somehow able to bring the tree back to life, and make it look much healthier and stronger.  But it is when he explains the meaning of Christmas that the ""gang"" gets the point of Christmas, and what Charlie Brown was trying to do.
""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" ends with newfound meaning for Christmas, hopefully not soon forgotten by either the Peanuts Gang, or, more importantly ... us.",1005696000,147,2110,4.865921787709497

589788,5,6303167314,"...and I'm not talking about Charlie Brown's tree.
I really can't remember when I first saw this special. Couldn't have been the debut year of 1965, as in those pre-cable days, our antenna couldn't pull in a CBS station. More likely would've been circa 1971 or 1972, long enough for this to have been firmly established as a holiday staple.
At that age, eleven or twelve, I would've been well past the age where I might've sat in toddler awe at some of my favorite comic strip characters coming to life. And celebrating my favorite holiday, no less.
Despite my ""advanced"" age, I still thoroughly enjoyed the show, even if my ability to appreciate it was substantially limited to Snoopy's antics and Schroeder's exasperation in finding a version of ""Jingle Bells"" suitable to the reigning fussbudget, Lucy Van Pelt.
As my age truly advances, it becomes even more enjoyable to find more layers to the cartoon. Much as the Warner Brothers classic cartoons were not truly written for children, but for the writers' own amusement, a more adult view of Charles Schulz's work reveals that this really isn't kiddie fodder.
In a way, Vince Guaraldi's score illustrates the point perfectly. Out in front is the ""Linus and Lucy"" theme, a bouncy tune to which any age can be-bop along. Contrast that with ""Christmastime Is Here""; the lyrics are cheerful, joyful, perfectly descriptive of a child's delight at the season's arrival.
And yet, the tune belies the sentiment. It is nearly hopeful, yet somber, knowing it's missing something but not sure what that might be. Just like Charlie Brown's dilemma throughout everyone else's festivities.
The only real disappointment on this disc would be the bonus feature ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"", which looks more like a series of largely unrelated continuity-independent vignettes from the 1980's Saturday morning ""Charlie Brown and Snoopy"", slapped together to form the illusion of a featurette, than a coherent story deserving of co-starring with the original.

If you celebrate the feeling of Christmas, then you don't need all that superficial stuff.  Charles Shultz was a genius in his own way.

""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is one of the only cartoon Christmas specials that I know actually discusses the TRUE ""true meaning of Christmas.""  I enjoyed watching this cartoon as a child and I'm sure my own daughter will enjoy it, too.",987465600,5,699,4.8
589833,5,6303167314,"I just love this Peanuts cartoon, it brings me back to the simple times of the 60's and 70's and I fondly remember when I first saw this, I had just arrived in this country and so whenever I see it I go back to that time. Christmas was nicer and more fun then. Charles SHultz was a great man to have done Peanuts and I can see his heart felt feelings in each cartoon. Everyone will enjoy this Christmas cartoon and the message it has.",984700800,,434,4.058139534883721
589834,5,6303167314,"Aside from the excellent transfer, the DVD also contains a scene that was omitted from the network broadcasts for many years, no doubt to make room for more commercials. It immediately followed the scene where the characters are catching snowflakes on their tongues. They are shown throwing snowballs at an old tin can on a fence. When this scene ends, it slowly stops snowing and Charlie Brown goes to Lucy's Psychiatric Help stand. This explains the abruptness in the network broadcasts and older videocassette releases when one moment it's snowing and the next it's not as well as the obvious cut in the background music. I haven't looked at the supplemental material yet (I would've preferred an old interview with Charles Schulz on the making of this special), but just having the complete, uncut program makes this DVD worth the price.",978566400,3,841,4.971631205673759
589835,5,6303167314,Charlie Brown wants to know what Christmas is all about and Linus has the answer.  Can you imagine any other show daring to give that same answer today?  Just a gentle reminder from Charles Schulz that the simplest answers are always the best.,976665600,3,243,4.627906976744186
589836,5,6303167314,"Simply, this is the best Christmas show ever produced. If it were made presently,the edge would be off, the sountrack would be sung by various""divas"" and teen hearththrobs,and Charlie Brown himself would different. This masterpiece,which was awarded a Peabody[and an emmy],is no less than a subtle,full frontal attack on Christmas as it is now celebrated. By using the beloved Peanuts characters. Schultz gets away with something that now he would be censored for. The plot,known to most,is simple. In this first Peanuts special, Charlie Brown,hapless everyman with a good great heart,is looking for the soul of ChristmAS.With his intrepid buddy Linus[and his ever present security blanket],he becomes the head [director ]of the local christmas pagent. When he is sent out to buy a christmas tree , well, you'll see. Linue delivers the most accurate summation of christmas known to exist. No teacher,scholar,theologian,etc.could ever touch this. The ending,itself is perfect. Vince Guaraldi's score is now legendary,and if anything is UNDERRATED.For a few years CBS used to,this is delicious irony,cut off the ending to bring a commercial! Boy,they sort of missed the boat,hunh?Do yourself a favor,buy this,play it whenever you get depressed. Better than prozac,and no side effects. I'd give it 10,20,30 stars!!!!!!!!!!",976406400,2,1319,5.567164179104478
589837,3,6303167314,"Well, I was never really a big Peanuts fan. But, this deserves special attention. From the start, Charlie grabs us. The truth is that many people get depressed around Christmas; and since Charlie feels that no one likes him, he especially gets depressed. (Holidays always seem to rub it in if we feel alone.) Also, he is disturbed at the huge commercial aspects of Christmas. Charlie is then called upon to direct a Christmas play and get a tree for the play. It is clear that the other children are distant from Charlie, and it is also clear that they expect a tree that will reflect the commercialized aspect of Christmas. He takes a stand and buys the tree that seems to need a friend. Linus' role is very well done here. Notice he does not criticize the tree itself or Charlie's intentions! But he is concerned that Charlie will be taunted for this. The next scene is done well. Charlie tried (even if unkowingly) to bring the true meaning of Christmas into a crowd that concentrated on the commercial aspects. As Linus fears, Charlie was in fact taunted and mocked for carrying the true meaning of Christmas in a commercial society. When Charlie is mocked, Linus (who also seemed to be carrying the true meaning of Christmas) shows bravery and confronts everyone with the true meaning of Christmas. It is almost as if he carried it, but was afraid to unleash it; and when he saw Charlie show bravery that he would be mocked for, he felt he had an obligation to act. Through this, the mood of the children change. So, Charlie and Linus carry the true meaning of Christmas in a society that does not; Charlie is mocked and taunted; Linus feels compelled to step in; the mood of the whole gang changes for the better. Even if you don't really care for The Peanuts, you should watch this.",975801600,3,1789,4.559006211180124
589838,5,6303167314,"Charlie Brown starts out by talking to his best friend, Linus about how he is not happy at Christmas time. he says, ""I like decorating, and giving presents, but I'm still not happy"" then Linus informs Charlie, ""Charlie Brown, you're the only person I know who can take a great holiday like Christmas and turn it into a problem. Like Lucy says, of all the Charlie Browns in the world your the Charlie Brownest."" Everyone in the cartoon thinks that Christmas is getting too commercial. Lucy thinks that Charlie Brown has Pantaphobia which is the fear of everything. Also she thinks he needs involvement to feel better so Charlie Brown becomes the director of the school play. He then is givin the task of getting a Christmas tree, but just finds more failer. So watch the first animated peanuts cartoon.",975715200,,801,4.728571428571429
589839,5,6303167314,"There really were aluminum Christmas trees back then. There were also pink frosted trees with some really psychedelic decorations, too.
I've watched this every year since I was a child. I used to stare up at the TV while CBS played that ""SPECIAL"" graphic and music and then . . . there it was: The Charlie Brown Christmas special!
Now that I'm an adult, my schedule has almost made me miss the show each Christmas season. But now that I have the video, I will never miss it! A friend of mine even gave me the cassette of Vince Guaraldi's musical score to go along with it. Hooray!
I'm always touched by the message in the story. Christmas is too commercial. It pains me to see Christmas stuff in the stores before school starts, or to see commercials pandering to children so their parents can buy more stuff. But watching Charlie Brown and the gang reminds me of a simpler time.
Snoopy, with his gaudily decorated dog house, represents all that's commercial and greedy about Christmas. Charlie Brown tries to overcome that with his involvement in the school play and his search for the right Christmas tree to set the mood for the play cast members.
I love this show. I heard that ABC bought the rights away from CBS for all the Charlie Brown specials. But I'm glad I have my video copy so now I don't have to worry about whether it airs or not.",975628800,34,1346,4.4534412955465585
589840,5,6303167314,"Watching ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is as traditional as decorating the tree at our house.  Although this video is quite old, the lesson of remembering the true meaning of Christmas is definately not outdated.  The catchy theme song and Linus's explaining the true meaning of Christmas will never be out of style!  This is a video that families can watch together and BOTH parents and kids will enjoy.  It shares its wisdom in a way that is fun, not preachy or too heavy for children.  In my opinion, this is a far better Christmas special than many new ones that are being produced!",975283200,3,584,4.631067961165049

589851,5,6303167314,"My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year.  This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.
Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special.  I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday.  Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic.  This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.
This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children.  This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection.",973123200,19,776,4.7611940298507465
589852,5,6303167314,"Its wonderful to have this treasure out on DVD!  Charles Schulz was a genius, and this special his finest television work.

589853,5,6303167314,"Poor Charlie Brown is sad around holiday time... In a way he was right about the holiday being to Comercial.. The Peanuts do a WONDERFUL job of telling kids about the true meaning of Christmas. It is not just getting presants.. It is about having friends and family around. I won't spoil the rest, but watch for Linus telling Charlie Brown what Christmas is really about.. This is something all of us could watch and feel good about..",971654400,5,434,4.576923076923077
589854,5,6303167314,"Word has it that Charles Schultz, when presented with the idea of an animated Christmas special for television based on his wildly popular ""grown-up"" kids, he insisted that it feature the Bible prominently.  The studio honchos thought this would be poison; Schultz held out, feeling that the message of the Christmas story was infinitely more compelling than something fictional and fanciful.  He was right, of course, and Linus' shepherd soliloquy remains the highlight of this delightful, melancholy and enduring musical treat.  Those Peanuts characters, with their odd heads and instantly recognizable voices, are as much philosophers as they are cartoons.  This is one special everyone should watch every year, and get a bit of real Christmas.",970358400,5,747,5.413793103448276
589855,5,6303167314,"With this package, you get 2 holiday specials!  A Charlie Brown Christmas (5+ stars) and Happy New Year, Charlie Brown (4 stars).
The 1st is the video that started it all for Peanuts animation back in 1965.  How many of us had to see it as a kid?  Charlie Brown is asked to direct the Christmas play by Lucy and is determined not to let it be another commercial Christmas play.  Things go awry when nobody wants to listen to him (they'd all rather dance around!).  Snoopy decorates his doghouse in hopes to win 1st prize, drives the whole Peanuts gang crazy (tries to steal Linus' blanket causing everybody to crash on the ice and tries dancing on Schroeder's piano until he gives that crazy beagle the scowl to get off!).  It's up to Linus to shed light on the true meaning of Christmas.
Happy New Year, Charlie Brown was done 20 years later.  Although not as good as A Charlie Brown Christmas, it has its moments.  Christmas vacation is almost over and Charlie Brown still hasn't written his term paper on Gulliver's Travels.  He goes to the New Year's Eve Party in hopes to see the Little Red Haired Girl.  Will he get to see the love of his life?  Will he get his term paper done in time (and manage to get a decent grade)?",969840000,7,1227,4.361233480176211
589856,5,6303167314,"Commenting on what a wonderful Christmas special this is would be superfluous: I would only be echoing the comments of all the reviews of the  VHS edition.  As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no  artifacts, good sound.  Skip the second feature, ""It's Christmastime  Again, Charlie Brown.""  It just doesn't compare.  My only gripe about  the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my  attention and my heart.  Every year, I watched for the moment when the  Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began  singing ""Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo"" to the tune of  ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing.""  As the camera pulls in on the  left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one  frame when they all take a breath.  You can see Patty's orange dress  suddenly appear where his head was.  I was really sorry to see them fix  that.  I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to  me.",968716800,6,991,4.480225988700565
