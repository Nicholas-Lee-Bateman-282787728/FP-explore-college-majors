8519988,1,B007OXWX24,Very little kettlebell work & the form is not good on any of it; it is in the give-a-way bag.,1383955200,,93,3.7
8519989,5,B007OXWX24,"KB Squared is a new interval workout from Amy Bento Ross which combines kickboxing and kettlebells. I am a high intermediate exerciser who loves both kickboxing and kettlebells (although I am less experienced with the latter), so this DVD sounded perfect for me. Amy works out here with just a single background exerciser, Uchenna. At some points, Amy and Uchenna use two kettlebells (12kg each), but an inset comes onscreen to show how to modify with dumbbells (you can also use a single kettlebell and switch sides, which is what I did). They are in a large, open studio with wood floors, and the music is fun and upbeat.

The Main Menu on this reads as follows:

The main workout alternates between kickboxing combos and kettlebell intervals, with four total of each. I have provided time breakdowns and a brief overview of each segment below.

WARM-UP, 8 minutes
Amy gets things moving immediately with kickboxing moves. She starts with a hi-lo jab to the side; this is followed by four alternating punches, four alternating ""jawbreakers"" (huge uppercuts) moving forward and then four uppercuts moving back. Gradually adding on, she includes two hi-low hooks to either side, a triangular foot pattern (with ""quiet"" arms), alternating knees with a triple step in-between, and then an alternating block to finish. Amy runs through this combo several times one side before switching to the other; she finishes by alternating.  This was a fun warm-up which quickly raised the heart rate.

COMBO 1, 9 minutes
This first kickboxing combo starts with a forearm strike, a half-turn retreat, and a hook/uppercut. Amy gradually builds on this, adding two knees, four jabs, and finally, four kicks, with an optional jump kick to the front and ending with a roundhouse kick. She teaches the moves all on one side before moving to the other, then switches between the two. The moves are fairly simple, although it took me several tries to pick up the choreo here.

INTERVAL 1, 4.5 minutes
For this segment, Amy uses a single kettlebell for a high pull, snatch, and middle getup combination (the latter is sort of a part Turkish getup in reverse with a bridge hold).

COMBO 2, 5.5 minutes
For this second combo, Amy and Uchenna set up facing to one side. They begin with a jab-jab-cross followed by a head block and parry block. This is followed by a side kick, double front kick, and then jump back to re-set. Again, Amy switches to the other side, then moves back-and-forth. I found this second combination much easier to follow, and it was my favorite of all of the kickboxing segments.

INTERVAL 2, 4.5 minutes
Here Amy and Uchenna use two kettlebells for double swings, double cleans, and front squats.

COMBO 3, 6 minutes
Amy beings this section with right-left-right quick jabs, finishing with a hook. She then steps forward for two uppercuts and a jawbreaker. These are followed by two different knee blocks, a roundhouse kick, and finally, a jumping back kick. As with previous segments, she alternates sides once she has taught the entire combination. This was a bit tricky too, although I mostly had it by the end. However, it went on and on...Amy kept saying ""just 4 more,"" ""2 more,"" but she went went on...and on..and on!

INTERVAL 3, 5 minutes
Here Amy uses one kettlebell for four push-ups, four renegade rows, and then two walks forward and back; after a brief rest, she performs a second set, then switches to the other side.  This is my least-favorite strength segment, and I often skip it.  (Luckily, the entire DVD is well-chaptered.)

COMBO 4, 7 minutes
This last combination starts with a jab-jab-cross, performed twice. Amy adds three turning kicks to this (knee crescent kick, roundhouse, back kick) and then a full crescent followed by three roundhouse kicks, alternating sides. The combination is first practiced on one side before moving on to the other. After finishing the kicking combo on both sides, she performs a brief punch combo--upper-upper-hook-hook--16 repetitions per side.  I have trouble with the turning kicks, but I'm able to follow the choreography if I leave out the turn.

INTERVAL 4, 4 minutes
Using double kettlebells, Amy moves from clean to rack, finishing with double cleans. She then performs overhead press with a step back lunge hold.

COOL-DOWN, 3.5 minutes
This is a standing segment which includes dynamic flows, mainly moving from horse stance through moves such as standing lunge, glutes stretch, etc.

STRETCH, 5 minutes
This lying segment continues the stretching on the floor, beginning with a lying pretzel twist and moving into a seated forward bend, child's pose, shoulder stretch, and hip flexor stretch.  I especially appreciated this segment, as so many kettlebell DVDs don't include a final stretch, and this is a nice one.

This DVD also includes several premix options; the Premix menu breaks these down well, but briefly, they are as follows: Quick Power, 38:30m; Bell Power, 44:21m, and Full Power, 63:23m.

Overall, I enjoy this DVD quite a bit. I love that Amy made it mostly low impact (the jumps are optional, and she recommends that you go barefoot for the workout). I am also impressed that Amy obtained her RKC certification, which I understand she did NOT have for her earlier kettlebell workouts. As I mentioned above, however, I did find some of the kickboxing choreography to be a bit tricky--this may have just been me, as I have trouble with directional changes, but those who prefer simpler choreography like myself should take note. Also, while I enjoyed Amy's kettlebell work, she spent quite a bit of time setting up the kettlebell moves, making those segments even shorter than the time estimates I quoted due to the time she spent talking. In the end, however, this DVD has great chaptering, fun moves, and plenty of variety, so I do recommend it highly. Final rating: 4 1/2 stars.",1376006400,2,5915,4.925628140703518
