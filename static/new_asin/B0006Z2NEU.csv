8043987,5,B0006Z2NEU,"Episode 28 - Team Emperor on Akina

Team Emperor continues its sweep of the Gunma area and Akina is their next target! Next to the Lan Evo, the Eight Six is outclassed but with Tak behind the wheel, anything can happen.

Episode 29 - The Feeling of Defeat

The battle between the Eight Six and the Evo IV begins, and the pride of every racer in the Gunma area falls upon Tak's shoulders.

Episode 30 - Hollow Victory

Team Emperor takes a fall and Tak remains Gunma's number one driver. However, Tak feels that he didn't earn the victory since it was on his home course and vows never to race on Akina again.",1116115200,,608,4.298245614035087
8043988,5,B0006Z2NEU,"STAGE 2 IS FINALLY HERE!!  We got a preview of what Stage 2 had in store for us in the last episode (# 27) on Battle 9: Akina's Superstar Challenge, and I've gotta tell you, the show has improved overall!!  The graphics are better, and the racing action is more intense than ever!!  The animations from the episodes in Stage One (Battles 1-9, Episodes 1-26) were very shabby compared to those improved graphics in Battle 10 (Stage 2).  I don't bash the series at all, I own them all, and thoroughly enjoy each and every DVD.  Each episode packs unexpected surprises.  I will never get sick of watching them!  I finish watching one and am craving the next one more than the one before.  Can't wait till May 10th for Battle 11: Blow-Out!  Hint to fans:  For those who watched this DVD, Bunta reveals that he has plans of doing a complete overhaul of the engine for the AE86, but we don't know what.  We do know that he will only install the engine if either A) Tak loses a race or B) the engine blows (it has over 200,000 miles on it).

In this DVD, Team Emperor and their team of Lan-Evos have plans to take over all of Goonma.  Their only two stops left to make are in Akina (Speed Stars) and Akagi (Red Suns).  Tak takes on a white Lan-Evo on Akina's downhill, making for a close race.  You may be able to guess who wins, but just wait to see how he does!! ;)  Also, there are new videos for the opening and closing credits, and a new closing credits song (Japanese music video) which is cool.  Anywho, any and all of the Tokyopop Initial D DVD's are worth buying, especially for Americans, because the subtitles are kind of boring (not the same as the English dialogue).  I rather enjoy Iggy's funny comments and American-style dialogue and slang.  If you enjoyed any of the other Initial D DVD's Battles 1-9, I highly suggest that you pick this one up!  I also suggest that if you have a craving like I do, pick up the Japanese versions of Stages 1-3 and the episodes currently available for Stage 4 (I think there are 6 Battles, 2 episodes per disc for Stage 4).  Also, pick up the Battle Stage and Special Stage DVD's, they are kickin'!!",1113868800,,2142,4.345088161209068
