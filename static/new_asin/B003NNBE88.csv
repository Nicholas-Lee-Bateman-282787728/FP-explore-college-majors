8401262,3,B003NNBE88,"This is a nice story of how the couple reared their dogs and how they live on a day to day basis.  There is some good information regarding the high needs of the breed but there were a few issues such as ""accidently dropping food for the dogs when preparing meals"" that I didn't agree with.  Ended up fast forwarding through some of it - although the section on the dogs at the dog pool and swimming was very funny.",1359849600,,415,4.175
8401263,5,B003NNBE88,"Vizslas a Go Go is one of the best dog videos I've seen. The tips on keeping dogs happy and entertained is very helpful. Since watching the video and implementing the techniques, my dog is much happier and I can help her burn more energy easily. These techniques have already helped my dog be more happy, more obedient, and less bored. She's also stopped barking for food. Even if you don't own Vizslas, you will get lots of great tips on everything from playing with your dog, training your dog, grooming your dog, and more. I wish I had this information years ago when I first got my dog but it's never too late. I highly recommend this video to all dog owners.

8401264,4,B003NNBE88,"A little amateurish (camera jiggles some in parts) but loaded with tons of information.  I've paged through a couple of the Vizsla books, but it was hard for me to get a grasp on what these dogs are like. I saw them on Dogs 101 and they looked like fun.  This DVD doesn't spend time on the breed history, breed standards, or other stuff that's easy to find on the internet.  Instead it's real world.  This video really helps put things into perspective for me. Thinking of getting a dog in the next year or so.  Feel good that I took a look at this.  I feel more prepared.",1277251200,2,572,4.201834862385321
8401265,5,B003NNBE88,"I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this DVD, but I took a shot and
got it from their website. It's pretty informative.  Very satisfied with the
purchase. The dogs are adorable. Especially the little one. There are some
sweet moments and they share a lot of information about how they handle
their dogs. I got some good ideas. I feel like we really got to see how to
handle these dogs. I see that it's a big commitment to own a Vizsla, but I
think we could handle it. This DVD gave me some good ideas that could get us
off to a good start. I am especially impressed that the owners are able to
scrape the dog's teeth without restraining them.",1275350400,,648,4.225806451612903
