8526093,3,B0088FS1CI,"This is apparently a remake of a superior 1996 film. The production takes place in 1732 Japan as the Shogun has banned extravagant spending because...he can? One of the lords ignores the order and gets warned, and in return he is out capturing former concubines of the Shogun and putting them on display because this will somehow get us a new Shogun. Then again, these Ninja plots always confuse me. Our Ninja women with magical powers have the task of killing the women before they can be put on display.

I thought Kunoichi  Lady Ninja was better.

2 stars for the sex and nudity",1462492800,,581,4.5673076923076925

Instead the viewer has a C rated film that is okay but has quite a few What??? moments that will either have you laughing at the satire of the genre (like Scream for American horror) or crying in shame that this movie was purchased. Just read review that was posted yesterday and be warned- this ""remake"" has nothing to do with the nineties version. The story- Four sisters have been raised and trained to be kunoichi (female ninjas) and each has super powers jumped from Mortal Kombat! Eldest sister Tsuragi has ice powers like Sub-Zero. Kogana uses solid light butterflies to dispatch her foes. Ujikyo has plant powers that, well that has to be seen to understand. The youngest is Shima who can shapeshift into other women( which really isn't useful in combat). The sisters are tasked to kill off three women that the Shogun slept with before he came to power. The prince wants the women alive for a show trial that would weaken the Shogun. Both sides are in a power struggle over austerity measures. The lady ninjas face opposition from another ninja clan, all men, and they too have powers. Good thing because if both sides depended on true swordsmanship they would all die of embarrassment. Not for fans of Japanese martial arts as this film has none. 2.5 stars rated up to three as the actresses are nice and try to make the best of this film. Watch for something to do or as a party film but don't buy expecting a real film.",1379980800,2,1568,4.603571428571429
8526095,1,B0088FS1CI,"Back in college, I rented a VHS copy of Lady Ninja: Reflections of Darkness.  It was from the mid 90s and was one of the most hilarious and fun japanese ninja-sploitation movies I have ever seen. I was looking to purchase the movie for years, and finally found it offered on dvd here. I bought it, not paying too much attention to the 2011 date (I thought that was the release date of the DVD, as opposed to the date the movie was made).  I was very upset to learn that the movie that I bought is a very poor remake of the original, and is nowhere close to the story line or creativity of the original. This is pure garbage and should not be watched! It has bad acting, poor quality, bad consumer camera recording, and even worse special effects than the original 90s version!  Do not support this movie! It is a money grab for those looking to find the unique original version!",1379894400,,878,4.3090909090909095
8526096,4,B0088FS1CI,"I liked Lady Ninja Reflections of Darkness. These lady ninja movies from Japan are not high on action because of their low budgets. But this movie does make up for that with its cute Japanese actresses who show a lot skin. Not to mention, Kei Mizutani is in this flick also. And that alone made me want to buy this dvd.",1365984000,2,319,4.245901639344262
