Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Every parent wants their teen to have this info.
Set the stage for a great life...you know John Gray is the Best!",1447113600,,219,4.7894736842105265
7912725,3,B00000JN65,"This video does a very good job of examining the differences between men and women in relationship formation and addresses common pitfalls for both.  In tape one, John discusses and summarizes what he calls the five stages  of dating and states that in subsequent classes/tapes/seminars, he will  expand on each of these stages.  In tape two, he expands on stage one,  ""attraction"", but doesn't cover the other four stages as stated.  I had to look to be sure I wasn't missing tapes.  I want to have the other  stages covered too!  How did this oversight or omission happen? It's good  but doesn't seem complete.",947721600,4,612,4.798076923076923
