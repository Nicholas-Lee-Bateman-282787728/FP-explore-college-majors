8078953,3,B000ANEU6C,"When I recieved the vhs it didn't work because the magnetic tape had fallen off on one side. I sent an email saying this and asking for a new video or a refund. The seller responded a day or so later and gave me a full refund and said I didn't have to worry about sending the vhs back because it was broken. It sucked that the video didn't work, but I still got a refund though.",1291680000,,378,3.9220779220779223
8078954,5,B000ANEU6C,"Loved this. Can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
Don't know what's taking Disney so long to put on DVD.
I mean, they already put everything else on DVD, why not this?",1272067200,8,167,4.090909090909091
