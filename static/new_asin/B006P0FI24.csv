5011845,5,B006P0FI24,"Cheryl ladd can do no wrong in my book so of Course I loved this movie, very interesting to see grace Kelly as a young girl just starting her career and the costars she fell in love with, very well written and I just learned cheryl ' husband Brian russell wrote it and the real grace gave her approval,  I highly recommend this film",1396051200,5,332,4.1875
5011846,5,B006P0FI24,"Cheryl Ladd did an splendid job playing this role. Although the film starts out a little bland, it starts to roll making you feel as if you are back in her time. Enjoy!!  Cheryl Ladd is dead ringer for Grace!! Classic in my records!",1393891200,5,232,4.2727272727272725
5011847,3,B006P0FI24,"I found the movie just ok.  I wanted to know more about Grace Kelly and this didn't deliver everything I was looking for, but the acting was ok.  It was a rainy afternoon nothing to watch rental that served its purpose.",1393632000,,219,4.317073170731708
5011848,5,B006P0FI24,The story is beautiful and Cherl Ladd and the cast were just wonderful.  This is a very beautiful movie and a wonderful love story.  I remember when she left the states to be married and all the newspaper reports.,1382832000,3,213,4.435897435897436
5011849,3,B006P0FI24,"It was mainly about her life as an up and coming movie star, which didn't last very long. I wanted more of the love story between she and the Prince of Monaco, instead it was practically void of his story and her life seemed quite boring. Her father didn't support her in much of anything. It was a bit slow and not very interesting.",1367798400,2,333,4.21875
5011850,5,B006P0FI24,Saw this movie years ago on Lifetime channel and had it recorded on VHS tape... Bought it through Amazon and am happy that it is now part of my DVD collection.. Cherly Ladd is an excellent actress...,1364947200,8,199,4.405405405405405
5011851,5,B006P0FI24,I remember viewing this on TV and thought Cheryl Ladd was extremely lovely as young Princess Grace.  There was alot of interesting family conversations and valuable advice handed out by Grace Kelly's mother that are both intelligent and memorable. I wondered at the time if Princess Grace was agreeable to this movie and after some research I found that she gave advise during the filming of this biography which makes me think the story is very true to life.  It also contains some rare film footage of the real wedding that took place in the 1950's.  I think it is a gem of a movie and highly recommend it for us ladies that love chick flicks and good old fashioned movies!,1353196800,14,675,4.56198347107438

5011869,4,B006P0FI24,"Nice TV movie depicting Grace Kelly's life from childhood up until her marriage to Prince Rainier.  It does seem pretty accurate based upon the books I've read about Grace Kelly and I did enjoy watching it.  The acting isn't the greatest, as it is a TV movie, but they do an adequate job.",1409616000,,288,4.415094339622642

8502512,5,B006P0FI24,"This is an enchanting movie about Grace Kelly's movie career and wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco.  Cheryl Ladd does an excellent job portraying the beautiful, classy Grace Kelly.  Grace was born to be a Princess.  She was far more regal than the family she married into, not to mention her less than well behaved children.  She deserved so much more.  This movie ends with her marriage.  It is very good.",1507420800,,408,4.676056338028169

8502514,5,B006P0FI24,Very interesting movie about the life of the American actress Grace Kelly who would become Princess Grace of Monaco. Cheryl Ladd and Ian Mc Shane did an excellent job as did the entire cast. It did seem a bit fast paced in some areas. I would have liked to have seen some more details in the movie about Princess Grace's life and wish it had gone further past her wedding day. The movie does show some authentic newsreels of the real Grace Kelly and her family on the ship that brought them to Monaco for her wedding with her Prince waiting to greet them. A nice movie about the life of Princess Grace.of Monaco.,1487030400,,612,4.37719298245614

8502520,4,B006P0FI24,"Well, I'm going to agree with the other reviewers on some of the things and disagree on others.  Cheryl Ladd is perfectly beautiful and very likeable but she lacks the cool stillness that Grace Kelly had.  She played the roll as an ordinary rich beautiful young girl with that type of personality. Of course I never met Grace personally but she conveyed on screen an aloofness no matter what she was doing that I've never seen any other actress convey.  And, that voice.  I don't blame Cheryl for not being able to come close to it.  Nobody could. The movie is beautifully cast and filmed.  Frankly, I can't think of another actress that could have portrayed Grace any better.  Maybe if Cheryl had studied more film of Grace or if she'd been better directed it would have rung more true.",1443830400,2,787,4.578571428571428
