8019432,5,B00020H2UE,"I saw this engaging little movie when it was on tv and loved it.  It was and is a delight, with bite -- and for those who know the L.A. area, even more  fun and a totally original, accurate romp in terms of making the characters fit the neighborhoods.  Surprise but natural outcome to the murder.  It appears that the actresses in it had time on their contracts from other TV series shows, so this made it even more fun to see them in other roles.  Julia Dufy, Cindy Williams, Jon Van Ark were terrific.  A great double bill with another humorous murder mystery, ""Compromising Positions,"" with Susan Sarandon and Raul Julia.",1403308800,,624,4.526785714285714
8019433,3,B00020H2UE,This movie is clearly a product of it's time and has a nostalgic vibe to it. It's a lot of fun to see several TV Stars of the 80's and 90's together in this movie and the plot while severly silly is done in a way that makes it fun to watch and doesn't take itself too seriously. Menu For Murder is a tv movie from the late 80's and it's clear that it wasn't meant to be serious but rather to be somewhat comedic and appeal to a particular demographic; the same demographic that likes LIFETIME movies and soap operas.  It's rather cheesy but definetly worth watching for a bit of frothy fun.,1224288000,4,590,4.175438596491228
