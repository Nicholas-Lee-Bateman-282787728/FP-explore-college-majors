This animated version is standard fare for children's television and was produced in Australia back in 1987.  The animation is limited as expected, but is nonetheless entertaining.  After a short prologue, the rest of the story is told in flashback by one of Dr. Jekyll's former servants to a pair of young kids as a bedtime story.  The acts of violence and murder are mostly suggested by the raising of Hyde's arms, legs, weapons, and silhouette, but not explicitly shown.  This emphasizes the seriousness of Hyde's villainy without showing any gore.  All in all a decent introduction to Robert Louis Stevenson's ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde..

This DVD's menu has chapter stops, a 10-question quiz, short biography with fun facts about the author, Robert Louis Stevenson, and a link to the releasing company's website, www.digitalversatiledisc.com.  The website is no longer in operation.  The quiz rewards a perfect score with a prize one can find on line at www.digitalversatiledisc.com/youwin.  (See pic.)  Going to that site gives you the same ""parked"" page as the main company website.  Does anyone know what that prize was?  The quiz also has an error in its answer key for Question #9, ""At the end, Dr. Jekyll locks himself in his laboratory to:"".  The correct answer isn't ""B. invent a cure for baldness"".  The correct answer is ""D. find a cure for himself"".  Answering ""B. invent a cure for baldness"" is the only way to get a perfect score of 10 out of 10.

This particular release was available at many dollar stores (Dollar Tree, Dollar World, etc.) for $1.00 and at Big Lots for $3.00.",1444435200,,1886,4.801242236024844
7917306,3,B00003CWI7,"I bought this to show my high school students after we finished reading Jekyll & Hyde. I knew a lot of kids would be absent because it was right before a holiday, so I wanted something that wasn't serious and would be more like a ""fun"" day.

This cartoon is so bad, so so very bad, that it's good. We had a great time laughing at the goofy scenes and voices. The kids were actually interested in watching it, but only so they could laugh at the truly ridiculousness of it all.

If you are looking for a serious way to experience Jekyll & Hyde, this isn't it. BUT, if you are a fan of cheesy, cult-classic-ish type films, go for it.",1441929600,,631,4.163934426229508

7917308,1,B00003CWI7,I bought this for Deaf students to watch an it does not have closed captions so I am very disappointed.  It was a waste of money!,1350691200,,129,3.9615384615384617
7917309,1,B00003CWI7,"I ordered the animated Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie from Amazon.com for $9.95 and got it today..... Only it had a bright green Walgreens sale sticker that says 2/$5 !!!!!! WTF?!!

Hmmmmmm.............. AWESOME. Called customer service, and ""the best they could do"" was issue a refund of $5.95 (which isn't as good as Walgreens offers, but oh well. LOL But I thought I would let you guys know... so take from it what you want;) LOL

Otherwise, its a good movie and I would rate it higher.. but I wanted to have a low score to bring attention to others about my experience;)",1239321600,,573,4.5
7917310,5,B00003CWI7,"I was dead set against buying this one and even more set against letting my sons watch it, but after viewing it myself first I changed my mind. This is a delightful way to let your kids get interested in the classics of literature. This not a completely faithful adoption of the tale but it is tailored for children so not to scare them to bad. The animation is of standard 70's T.V. kind so don't look for ""The Lion King"" quality animation here. All in all a nice little surprise.",1188432000,4,481,4.2967032967032965
7917311,5,B00003CWI7,"This movie was super. I really liked the part where Dr. Jekyll changed himself into Mr. Hyde, but I cried when at the end Dr. Jekyll died. But the rest I loved.",1140393600,5,160,4.03125
