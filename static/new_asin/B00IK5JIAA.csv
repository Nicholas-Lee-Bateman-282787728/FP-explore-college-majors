6268222,4,B00IK5JIAA,"Don't let the cover fool you. There is no sex in the movie and I like that it was a clean movie that had a deep story to tell. Basically the movie was a little low budget but that didn't even matter because the movie is so deep and intellectual. The only thing I hate about the movie is the ending. I just think it should have ended another way but I have to say with that being said, the ending really shocked me because I was not expecting that. But basically I think what the director wanted to show was how we close our heart to people and get so bitter in life that we do not really live it but instead just exist. I also think the director wanted to make a point without coming out and really saying it. I think the director wanted to show that sometimes as Christians, their views about love is hypocritical. And sometimes they judge people that are not Christian but sometimes people who say they do not even believe in Christ have more love and morals than some professed Christians do. And that concept right there was really deep. And I really liked the hospital scene because there was a deep message there if you look for it. The guy was talking about his father dying who had cancer. And he was supposed to be the one sick and dying but the director was trying to show the idea that the guy was in worse shape than his father although he was healthy. They guy could not love, could not trust anyone and he did not have a sense of humor at all. Sometimes we are sorry for the people that appear sick physically but mentally and spiritually may be more healthier than you and I who have not even been pronounced with no terminal illness. So what is our excuse?  If you are in to depth, stories and ideas then you will really find this movie interesting. But if you are not then you may find this movie boring and moving at a slow pace. But overall I did not feel that way about the movie. I admit the first three minutes had me kind of baffled on if the movie was going to be good or not but when I listened to the words and looked for meaning in the movie I really liked it. But that is just my opinion. For the overall intellect of the movie I give it a 5. But the reason I only gave it a 4 is because it did move a little slow at times, but not so slow that you could not keep up.",1456790400,3,2295,4.066225165562914
