8355827,2,B00286PLS0,"Done in the style of Forensic Files and other similar docu-drams ""based on true stories"", this show is dreadful. If they had edited out the frequent repeating scenes (like they often do in these made-for-TV shows to keep your interest) the stories might have been better, but probably would have been able to be show in 5-10 minutes. I hate when they do this on TV, but it is really annoying when they do it in a video you buy.

The Special effects are also rather dreadful - dressing up a guy in a ghost/ghoul/demon costume you could pick up at any Halloween store, was stupid and lazy.  I didn't know if I was suppose to be suspensfully fearful or splitting my side in laughter of the overly cheezey effects. The dialog & acting was  generally poor, althought a few of actors seem to at least have had some acting experience.

Overall, I wouldn't waste money on this unless you can get real cheap and have nothing better to do with your life for an hour or 2. Stupid me - I bought the Blu Ray version.",1309737600,3,1003,4.347593582887701
