a lot funnier.",1447718400,3,225,4.743589743589744
5795784,1,B00DFBVIVG,"First time I ever watched Anjelah Johnson and did not find her funny. In all fairness, I did not watch the show to the end, it was so awful. I love her as Bonquiqui and the young woman going to a Vietnamese nail salon. maybe it got better, but, life is too short to watch a boring unfunny entertainer.",1447718400,,301,4.11864406779661

5795788,5,B00DFBVIVG,"She has such great expressions.  Very funny.  I didn't get all of her references, not being Latina, but it didn't matter.  And, unlike most comics, nothing vulgar!",1446940800,,163,4.962962962962963
5795789,1,B00DFBVIVG,"I'm not sure why this sad excuse for a comedy special has four stars... I'm sure she's a very nice woman, but frankly, I can't figure out who thought that she deserved her own comedy special ...  Ms. Johnson is about as funny as your younger sister telling a somewhat boring story at a family dinner (and to be honest, I'm not sure that she would qualify even to that low of a standard ).  She spends far too much time talking about herself (not in a generalized way as lead-ins to larger issues and subjects) but literally just about herself....  frankly, she doesn't belong in the ranks of professional comedians for one very simple issue....her timing is terrible.

I love all types of comedy from any type of comedian... as long as they look like they've done it professionally for period of time and earned their chops.

Let's put it this way... I got this free on Amazon prime and I still turned it off before the end because I just couldn't take it anymore.

Spend your time listening to somebody that has EARNED their comedy chops like Bill Burr, Maz Jobrani or any one of several dozen other great comedians out there.",1446940800,,1127,4.5

5795816,2,B00DFBVIVG,"What happened between her first dvd performance and this one?  Where did her funny go?  This one fell flat, as well as the latest one (Not Fancy).  Yes, she's cute, but she uses all of her ""aren't I cute"" poses too often.  As well as using her ethnic-centered humor too often.
