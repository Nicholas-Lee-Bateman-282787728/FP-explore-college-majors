Konya wa Hurricane is worth the video alone, as Priss ""sings"" to her trademark song. One you should watch, even if your not a fan of the series.",1008028800,,583,4.669902912621359

I have heard the English version of these songs and trust me, there is little or no competition.  Strangers can expect to find beautiful women, savage mecha combat, powered armor, heavily armed police and cybernetic monstrosities all dueling for your attention in various music videos which are for the most part generously divided by footage contained in individual episodes.  The visuals are somewhat dated by todays standards but being over ten years old I think we can all afford to grant it a little leeway since when it came out it was all that and a side of fries.  ^_^  Being a tape full of music videos, the music is obviously the most important part.  It is also subtitled so can know what they're singing about if you truly need to know.  The entire production is inspired and easily deserves a place amongst the best that MTV might have to offer.  Take a chance and give it a try, I promise you won't be disappointed.",1002153600,,1080,4.588541666666667
