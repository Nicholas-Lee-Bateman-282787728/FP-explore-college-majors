8745350,3,B019IHBXK6,"The legend goes that whenever the Demon God is about to awaken again and ravage the land, the Goddess of Fate chooses six heroes, six Braves to defeat him before he can do so and designates them with a magically appearing tattoo of a six petaled flower.  Being so chosen is quite literally the highest honor anyone dreaming of becoming a hero can aspire to, and as increasing activities by lesser demons called fiends indicates the next awakening is approaching, the preparation, even competition between wannabes also increases.  Many but not all such chosen braves come from the ranks of the Saints, females with particular sets of magical powers over the things they are saints of, i.e. Blades, Gunpowder, Swamps, Mountains, Blood, etc.

The main protagonist is Adlet Mayer, self-proclaimed Strongest Man in the world, who tries to walk on to one of these preliminary competitions (said competitions do not automatically result in selection, in fact nothing automatically does, but it is thought to increase one's chances) and gets jailed for it.  However, after many, many days of imprisonment the tattoo does magically appear upon his arm, and Nashetania, the rabbit eared princess of Piena who had visited him in disguise out of curiosity, frees him.  (It turns out she also has the tattoo of selection.)  They ride towards the borderlands of the Demon God's realm where after a series of adventures the Braves are united, all seven of them....

There are only supposed to be six....

At this point the whole story changes, and it becomes a paranoid mystery to ferret out the False Brave, if False Brave there be, and unset the mystical barrier designed to hold the Demon King and his forces at bay while the Braves deal with him, which is currently holding the Braves in place.  This is astonishingly well written, and while the clues are all there, I doubt that even the most careful observer will completely solve the mystery before the end.  Secrets will be exposed, suspicions will be exchanged, and hearts will be ripped raw.  Suspects will be focused upon, all but proven guilty, then cleared, only to be focused upon again.  It really will keep you guessing right to the end.

So why only three stars?  Because of something that happens at the very, very end.  The mystery of the Seventh has FINALLY been dealt with, and all the explanations are in place and make perfect sense.  Then another Brave with the same tattoo shows up, and here we go again.  Now, I'm sorry, once is brilliant; two and three times (according to readers of the original light novels) is downright ridiculous and about as questionable a marketing gimmick as the one referenced in my review title!  I'm just thankful I watched it for free!

8745351,4,B019IHBXK6,"If there is one thing in the world Adlet is certain of, it is that he is the Strongest Man in it. Which is why he has to be chosen as one of the Braves of the Six Flowers, heroes who appear when the Demon God is on the verge of awakening with the sole purpose of putting this dangerous god back to sleep, permanently if they can. To the surprise of everyone around him, though of course not to Adlet himself, he is indeed chosen! So along with the bunny eared princess Nachetanya he sets off to save the world.

This series starts out as a standard fantasy story, hero gains special status and begins journey to save world, so on and so forth. Which is plenty of fun, but nothing too special. Then a few episodes in it does a complete genre switch and the grabs your attention, holding onto it until the end. I was so tickled I made a couple of friends watch it with me only a few weeks after seeing it the first time. Then I told my sister that she had to watch it and bugged her until she did. Everyone enjoyed it and all agreed that the ending was sort of evil (consider this your warning, series only covers the first book of a series and ends with a cliffhanger). But still totally worth watching. I just wish they would do a second season!

The other thing I wish for is a set that won't cost an arm and a leg. Note that you can get this same set for ~$70 from RightStuf (free shipping). But it is only the first set (likely out of three). I like the series, but not this much. I watched the series on Crunchyroll and that is where I will return for my rewatch pleasure unless a standard edition set is released.",1459900800,2,1618,4.117088607594937
