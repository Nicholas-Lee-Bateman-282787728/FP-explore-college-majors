7155014,2,B00WWRSQYG,"This is a documentary. Nice enough, but the description should make that clear.",1472774400,,79,5.153846153846154
7155015,5,B00WWRSQYG,Just great!!,1471910400,,12,5.5
7155016,1,B00WWRSQYG,"Unfortunately, this version did not work w/ US
dvd players, They did not have another version
so we didn't get to see the movie.",1470182400,,128,4.375
7155017,5,B00WWRSQYG,I LOVE this film. It's a brilliant story very well told. Serious and funny. Light but with substance it's a winner from the start....,1468281600,2,133,4.583333333333333
7155018,4,B00WWRSQYG,"I thought the film was charming.  It was presented as a documentary and therefore some of the less polished parts, in my opinion, simply added to the character of the film.  The horse was a ""street horse"" or in other words one who lacked the pedigree to be a winner.  The owners were working class people who, by all odds, shouldn't have been able to do anything right.  The film is all about grit, hard work and a little good luck. Better yet the story is true.",1467244800,4,462,4.275862068965517
7155019,5,B00WWRSQYG,"Just saw Dark Horse in a theater and hoped to buy it for a friend.  Sadly, it's only on PAL, not US Region 1.  The true story is filled with laughter and a touch of sadness.  It is about plucky small town Welsh working folks and a long shot horse competing with the POSH set.  It is shot in documentary style.  It does have beautiful shots of the Welsh countryside and stills of the hard side of clapped out coal towns.  It is a family movie, except for some hard to watch scenes of horses and riders not making the jumps.  It also documents the success of stem cell use to help repair damaged limbs.",1467244800,4,600,4.165217391304348
7155020,4,B00WWRSQYG,"One person was disappointed in the movie saying it was amateurish. I think that's the beauty of the film, since the owners of the horse were complete amateurs themselves. It's really an amazing story and inspirational for those of us who have horses.",1464652800,9,250,4.837209302325581
7155021,3,B00WWRSQYG,"A great story told badly. Most of the film was over exposed or out of focus so it appeared to have been made by amateurs using hand held camcorders. However, the yard long list of credits showed that, in fact, it was made by professionals. I suppose the quirky photography was an attempt to enhance the drama. Well it didn't work and it was distracting. I was torn between the story and watching this stupid directing. It could have been a much better movie had they used HD photography and professional actors to say the lines. Another film, with almost the same true story line, called 'Champion' is infinitely superior to this one. It stars John Hurt and contains some fabulous horse racing scenes; buy a copy and compare, I'm sure you will agree.",1464393600,,750,4.604477611940299
7155022,1,B00WWRSQYG,"I could not sit through this film.  I don't know if it was supposed to be a documentary or a film that was made to look like one, but it was so boring that I didn't want to find out.  It had no discernable storyline other than someone wanting to breed horses, which is by far not enough to carry a movie.  I stopped it half-way through, because it was exhausting hearing ordinary people talk about horses.  This film had nothing compelling about it, and as I wrote, I didn't finish it, which is pretty rare for me.  Just skip it.",1486598400,,529,4.198019801980198
7155023,5,B00WWRSQYG,Really great documentary and very well done. British horse racing is crazy!,1485388800,,75,5.333333333333333

7155027,5,B00WWRSQYG,Heart warming story of a talented race horse and the people who loved him. Needed subtitles due to heavy accents.,1484006400,,113,4.7

7155030,5,B00WWRSQYG,"fantastic movie bases on total true events, proves that anything is possible if you try hard enough, being a horse owner my self this movie gets an extra star. Also the movie uses the actual people that were involved not actors.  A bit documentary and movie melded together  while keeping your total attention.",1481932800,,310,4.830188679245283
7155031,4,B00WWRSQYG,"Feel good movie about a group of supposed ""lower class"" individuals using a well loved race horse to discover the joys of being an owner as opposed to a race viewer.",1481846400,,165,4.354838709677419

7155033,3,B00WWRSQYG,"This is an interesting story about horse racing, pulling together, and the struggles of mingling with the upper crust when you are not from there.  Not being a big horse racing fan it held less interest for me and I didn't like some of what I saw regarding treatment of horses.  The movie was pretty honestly done in terms of expressing the perspective and struggles of the horses' owners.  If you are a horse racing fan or have an interest in horse racing history you would probably rate the movie higher.",1480118400,2,506,4.538461538461538

7155037,5,B00WWRSQYG,"You don't have to love horses to enjoy it.  Very sweet story, with fun people and a lovely horse.  Nice light movie that keeps your interest.",1479254400,,141,4.384615384615385
7155038,2,B00WWRSQYG,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot, I love horses and rooting for the underdog. But, I just wasn't that into this one. It was so slow I literally fell asleep and had a hard a time finishing it. The story is brilliant and the people are fascinating, but the film didn't do the hardships of the investor's life much justice. They made it seem like they were lucky to dabble with the rich and famous, when in reality the people who were truly rich were the ones who owned their dream.",1479168000,,487,4.191489361702128
7155039,4,B00WWRSQYG,"Very enjoyable movie.  I'd set expectations more toward viewing an inspiring documentary more than a Disney ""Seabiscuit"" production.  Imagine if the hook in Seabiscuit were the horse being owned by 10 coal miners from Kentucky and it were film as a documentary.  It is a great story about people who come together and believe in something during otherwise hard times.",1479168000,,367,5.083333333333333

7155044,5,B00WWRSQYG,Very much enjoyed this movie. One of the great things about it was to see and hear the actual people who lived it.,1477526400,,114,4.0
7155045,4,B00WWRSQYG,Love all horse stories and this doc is a good one.  Sometimes difficult to understand the accents but worth the effort.,1477267200,,119,4.666666666666667

7155049,5,B00WWRSQYG,"Americans seem uncommonly uncomfortable discussing our own class struggles. But, boy, do we love to watch the Brits do it. I think that's one reason the inspiring and joyful Dark Horse is such an appealing film.

Undergirded by a stark realism, the Louise Osmond (Deep Water) documentary tells the story of Dream Alliance, a racehorse raised by a syndicate of 23 working-class men and women from a depressed Welsh mining town.

An underdog's underdog, the thoroughbred mare was bred by a barmaid whose only prior experience was with race pigeons. Dream Alliance and her owners were ignored by the hoity-toity racing world - until she won several midsize local races.

Dark Horse is at its best when it allows members of the syndicate to share their life stories. They speak lovingly of the mare, which became a symbol of hope for their impoverished region. They boast proudly of how she bounced back after a major injury for the 2009 Welsh National.

Dream Alliance and her friends - one can hardly call them owners - are now retired from the world of racing. Yet the camaraderie and love that binds them resonates.",1474588800,2,1115,4.821989528795812

7155060,3,B00WWRSQYG,"I would actually give this a 3+ because I'm interested in all things Ireland.  I gave it a 3 to alert folks for several factors.
- It's a docu-drama not a ""movie"".  It is based on actual occurrences with moderate embellishment
- it's very interesting but slow moving (that's why it's not a 4)
-  it will provide the viewer with some interesting perspectives on Ireland
-  you'll learn a lot about horse racing in Ireland / Scotland which is very different than our racing
- some friends of ours REALLY liked it.  We enjoyed it as something a little different.",1473724800,,559,4.4950495049504955

7155064,3,B00WWRSQYG,"Dark Horse w/Jan Vokes  - Clearly, this was a B or C movie, not one shown in theaters, I assume.  However, if you love horses, you can be entertained by this movie when you have an afternoon or evening free.  I wouldn't by this on DVD, but it's ok for a rainy afternoon or evening. It's always fun, like many sports movies, to see the underdog do well and the regular folk succeed, even if it's just once.",1473638400,,405,4.166666666666667

8714517,4,B00WWRSQYG,"I enjoyed it and its form makes it harder to do so- basically, it's just a 90? minute monologue- but one of many people, not just a single voice. The emotions and characterizations of each come fluidly through which Greatly enhances the movie.  Throughout you're given a front row seat to the class system encountered in the UK, (note the reporter interviewing at ring side for one of the more subtle examples.)
I loved it all the more, for depicting what a group of people can do when they decide to form a community. Only negative for me is I would have liked to know if Dream Alliance was put to stud. The best positive for me was its dipiction of how much deeper each one's personal pride is felt when an achievement is by a group rather than a solitary act. Somehow the group dynamic negates what others would judge as boasting or tacky bragging.
I hope it's repeated, if not by these folks again then by another community. It'd be a shame if thoughts of well, can't be done again, or such stopped any. A very great deal more came out of the experience for the community created than just income. Though that's nice too!
Cheers to the film makers for the courage of presenting this as a monologue of the group. Not a guaranteed format for success but one which complimented, no echoed the story.
Definitely worth watching regardless of how you view horse racing.",1502064000,,1367,4.512096774193548

8714519,4,B00WWRSQYG,"It is too bad there is an abundance of negative reviews not referring to the quality of the documentary itself but instead, to a most unfortunate technical issue that prevented some from viewing the DVD.

The documentary itself is uplifting and inspiring and I am befuddled by those who watched it and were unmoved. Hard to believe someone with a pulse could NOT be inspired by the story.

The story is reminiscent of the famous story of Sea Biscuit and is equally inspiring.

In the case the horse, DREAM ALLIANCE, the chutzpah of the working class alliance that had the vision and imagination to make this miracle happen should buoy anyone who feels their daring dreams belittled by others.  And their compassion and adoration for the horse as part of their extended family contrasts sharply with the uppercrust who would likely only see the earning potential of these animals.

Definitely, a remarkable documentary that will help me challenge the dismissive voices on my life path.",1496361600,,984,4.9393939393939394

8714521,1,B00WWRSQYG,"Do Not Recommend if you care about animals. I had never heard of steeplechasing before watching this movie. I don't know what was more disturbing, the sport itself or the owners of Dream Alliance deciding to put him through it a second time after he almost died from the event the first time. Pure and simple - this is cruelty to animals. What makes it worse is it is watched by many people as entertainment, who do not have any compassion for these beautiful, magnificent animals. England rightly outlawed fox hunting. Steeplechasing needs to be outlawed too. It should be outlawed in all countries who promote these races.",1488067200,2,624,4.787037037037037
