Also when I seen it advertised, It had an extra clip that showed neo soul pruduction of booney mayfield that wasn't on the dvd and he had no pdf to at least follow the chords. I tried to call the company for several weeks with questions regarding the dvd and left several messages with no response.  As much as im a fan of jamal hartwell and his magnificent skills, I don't think I'll invest or buy other products from him, sorry but that really turned me off when his company didn't return my calls!!!!. And the dvd he just showed of his playing skills with not much explanation to what he was doing. Normally I love his work and still do, but I won't order his products again!!",1397260800,2,752,4.529411764705882
8524946,3,B0084363N8,"Great video to clear up the secrets of neo-soul, but what was shown in the video could have been taught in one or two paragraphs. They basically tell you the neo-soul type chords. Once you know what chords they are, you can build your own and create a progression by just playing those chords in whichever particular scale you choose.",1376524800,3,334,4.583333333333333
