8227530,1,B000XA5K16,Used this movie for BSA Citizenship in the Community Merit Badge requirement.  This is really made as a documentary and so it was not what I expected.  It did not keep the kids attention because it was slow moving. The meaning of the movie is great but it feels like a low budget production.  Will not use this movie again.,1392940800,,323,4.35
8227531,5,B000XA5K16,"Holiday Express has been serving the poor and sick in body and spirit for nearly 20 years. This film follows the volunteers for one season, from planning during the summer through fifty concerts in thirty days from Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve at nursing homes, shelters, halfway houses and the like. The group was the brainchild of Tim McLoone, a musician, restauranteur, and genuinely good man, and he remains its driving force. The movie is a representation of the real spirit of Christmas.",1323043200,,499,5.097560975609756
