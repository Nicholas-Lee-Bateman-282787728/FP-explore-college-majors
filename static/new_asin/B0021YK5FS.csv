8349554,3,B0021YK5FS,"Good but not anything special, don't believe the hype. It could also have had more techniques shown. I think you get 10-15 techniques per dvd only.",1337904000,2,147,4.6923076923076925
8349555,5,B0021YK5FS,"This is among the best video series I have ever seen, and I have an extensive DVD/Video library. The techniques are polished and very well explained. Brandon's techniques is amazing. I look forward to his next series.",1298937600,3,217,4.891891891891892
8349556,5,B0021YK5FS,"Great reference for chokes, not for the weak at neck. It should be called ""10,000 and one ways to choke your opponent"". Brandon shows you more chokes than you will ever want to know. This DVD set is truly sick! A must have for your DVD collection.",1281052800,4,247,4.276595744680851
8349557,5,B0021YK5FS,"with this dvd coming from a member of the 10th planet jiu jitsu, i was def expecting some innovative & effective techniques...& to my suprise, i was not disapointed at all. Here this dvd shows six deifferent types of no-gi chokes that will def catch your partners off guard & tapping faster than you can imagine. the dvd shows about 15 - 20 types of set-ups for the specific chokes on each dvd (there are 3dvds total) and shows from multiple angles and multiple replays...and you can go straight to the specific technique that you want to watch so you can re-watch the choke to pratice yourself. All in all this is a pretty good investment in instructional dvds on no-gi..and for the type of chokes shown here, you might not find these in any other dvds around for a while. ( believe me i tried searching You-tube)with that being said, if money is a issue, you could try finding a friend with a copy to see for yourself but you won't be disapointed if you took a deep breath & just see for yourself. Btw if you're curious as to learn more of the 10th planet system, check out eddie bravo's ""MASTERING THE TWISTER & MASTERING THE RUBBER GUARD BOOK & DVD SET""",1266278400,10,1157,4.411214953271028
