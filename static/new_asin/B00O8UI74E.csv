6729472,2,B00O8UI74E,"This could have been an interesting film, perhaps even a good film. But, it is neither. Three problems are paramount: the first has to do with editing, which I found to be uneven and distracting especially during battle scenes. Good editing, along with good directing leaves the viewer with a sense of the direction and flow of battle. Excessive and choppy editing simply leaves the viewer confused. There's a section in which (spoiler alert) German forces are forcing the protagonists into a minefield. The director seemed unable to places cameras in a way which might have built tension into this moment. I suppose it might be argued that this was an effort to convey the confusion of battle, but, I suspect it more likely that it was confusion on the part of the director and/or editor.

The second, and perhaps even greater problem with this film was its budget. There were simply far too few extras in battle scenes that were meant to convey company or regiment size actions. Where hundreds were needed, a dozen or so had to suffice. The money issue is also apparent in props. Combat equipment is sparse. A postwar tank destroyer stands in for a Panzer. Trucks are of the wrong type, etc.

The third problem was a matter of believability. It seems unlikely to me that a large squad of French partisans would light lanterns and one after another walk downstairs in front of a large window in order to reach their ""secret location."" There were many moments like this where a desire to amplify drama clearly superseded any loyalty to realism.

On the positive side, the acting in this film was surprisingly good. Characters with a few exceptions were generally believable.

A final, and, to my mind, damning criticism (another spoiler alert): The film ends with the following epitaph ""Dedicated to all men and women on both sides who lost their lives during World War Two."" Every speaking portrayal of a German in this film was of a sadist, an incompetent, a duplicitous spy, or a coward. I will have you tortured throughout the night then your throats will cut be at sunrise. hisses a skinny, droop shouldered, bulging eyed SS officer you get the idea. Please don't mistake me. I do not doubt the existence of sadistic officers in the SS or for that matter the Wehrmacht. What troubles me is not the caricatures, but the supercilious final comment, so much at odds with the clear tenor of the film.",1425772800,13,2401,4.7368421052631575

6729474,4,B00O8UI74E,"Sure, this is yet another war film with the usual cliches...you know,the usual ""daring commando raid behind enemy lines"" type of thing. But i have to agree with the other reviewer(Jackie), in that it`s a rather well done action-packed film with great cinematography and music,with combat scenes that are somewhat reminiscent of  Band of Brothers with an obviously smaller budget. I thought the acting was quite good as well....but in any case, Allies is way better than a lot of recent B- movie war flicks like Ardennes Fury or Angel of the Skies etc. No, this movie is clearly NOT Saving Private Ryan or Fury, but i enjoyed it nonetheless...",1424995200,,642,4.836363636363636
6729475,1,B00O8UI74E,"I rented this hoping for a good action, covert mission behind enemy lines war movie to pass the time. I should have waited until someone else took the bullet for me... and wrote a review to wave me off.

I made it 7 minutes and 43 seconds into this movie and stopped watching it. I can tolerate many things in a war movie (WWII) ranging from bad acting to bad script but if they don't get the dress and decor of the times correct or if they don't align with actual military protocol then the ability to suspend disbelief goes out the window.

The opening scene around a group of commandos taking out a German machine gun emplacement is about the worst I have ever seen. If they had actual military consultation they might not have had ten or fifteen guys all standing around in a group firing everything from machine guns to rifles at an enemy line that was also a cluster of soldiers firing various weapons from rifles to machine guns with a mortar right in the middle. Note the operative word... standing. Uniforms were pristine, not a stitch of preparation for field work... no camo or face paint... amateur hour.

Having served time in the military and seeing what 5.56 and 7.62 caliber rounds can do to brick walls you learn that bushes and saplings provide no cover in a fire fight. You also don't stand around in a group firing your weapons on an enemy emplacement. You dig in and stay low and fire from cover. There may have been times when they broke cover and charged a position but it would be after the fire fight... with fixed bayonets and the soldiers would be running fast and low with the intent to get into cover and kill anything that stood in the way of this task.

At one point a soldier was standing out in the open firing his Enfield on a group of Germans... and this guy stood there the whole time while they fired back... right out of key stone cops. Eventually he was hit in the stomach and killed not surprisingly because you don't stand up and out in open in a fire fight. Appalling.

No actual prepared fire positions, no real cover, and all grouped together like a bunch of c rate actors all jockeying for position on the camera. Perhaps they didn't want to spread them out like a proper firing line because the camera was a fixed position without the ability to pan. Or maybe if they had panned they would have captured the fact that they were using a set built on about .2 of an acre of someone's backyard.

If the rest of the movie got better then I apologize but when you compare to the incredible sets and renditions of Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan... to mention a couple... this movie falls so woefully short of the mark in the first 7 minutes that you feel the need to watch The Guns of Navarone just to remind yourself that back then they had a fraction of the technology but could still produce something better than 'Allies'. Don't waste your money... seriously... please don't waste your money. If I could have mine back... I would be very grateful.",1424995200,41,3001,4.417721518987341
6729476,2,B00O8UI74E,"Totally unrealistic and a bit like the worst aspects of the film, Saints & Sinners, corny, stereotypical American and British characters.

And the ending, what?!?  I won't bother with spoilers here, but unless this is the end of your life and your last film before passing, don't buy it.",1424822400,7,287,4.836734693877551
6729477,3,B00O8UI74E,"An okay movie with no-name actors about a special operation during WWII Europe. Gripping, no, but mildly entertaining, attempting to be another 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Dirty Dozen'.",1454198400,,183,5.571428571428571
6729478,4,B00O8UI74E,"This British WW II film set in the year 1944, takes place right after the D-Day landings and it revolves around a group of British commandos led by French-American captain.  The group gets dropped behind enemy lines somewhere in norther France with a mission to assassinate a German general who is in possession of important maps that contain German fortifications along Normandy's coast.  After capturing the maps they are to contact French Resistance group who will than lead them towards the demarcation line where an American 3rd Army will be awaiting them.  As one can imagine...things don't go as planned.

I rated this film with 4 stars because I really enjoyed the story and found the characters interesting, including the traitor within the high rank...even though the film is unrealistic and makes the Germans seem literally like blind fools who can't shoot a person from a few meters away...the film also introduced me to a sexy French actress by the name of Emmanuelle Bouaziz...she is a jaw dropping beauty.",1453334400,,1020,5.017751479289941
6729479,1,B00O8UI74E,"I would give this movie minus stars if I could.
Plot:  A small mix of allied soldiers air dropped behind German lines sent to capture German maps which will be obsolete in a couple weeks or less.
These raiders possess an inexhaustible supply of ammunition and about 500+ pounds of grenades.  The NAZI's are of course stupid, evil beyond reality and incredibly bad shots.
Of course the good guys get shot up and no one goes into shock from being hit by an 8MM Mauser rifle.  Wounded men fully recover the next day and the hero cuts off his infected toe and suddenly becomes a sprinter taking on a sizable portion of the German army......and wins!.
Oh it gets worse by the minute.",1449532800,,678,4.495934959349594

6729483,2,B00O8UI74E,"I always wonder how movie producers/directors aren't able to see the stupidity in a scene where experienced soldiers of the Waffen-SS or even Wehrmacht run across an open field right into the bullet-hail of an MG42 firing at them. Every single one of them including the commanding officers is well aware of the devastating effect of the MG42 on line of soldiers running across open fields.
The whole story lost any credibility when the ambush was moved to happen earlier then the traitor and the Germans expected, yet the colon which supposedly had the real map acted as if they expected the ambush exactly where it happened. They should have traveled without that stop what warned the allies. Although the ambushers are always having the advantage, a fighting force of almost 40 German Soldiers with nearly 5 years war experience and probable anti-partisan experience would not be thrown off their guard that easy and defeated by 6 men.",1438819200,,937,4.936708860759493

6729492,1,B00O8UI74E,"This fails on so many levels. There is a reason this never made mass distribution. Suffice it to say, the only folks that could honestly rate this above a single star, would be the amateurs who produced it and that would be understandable. Could I have done better with the $1,500 budget over a three-day weekend- dunno, but these guys sure couldn't.  Got some good laughs out of it though. In all fairness, I FF'd through most if it but the first 10 minutes is really all you need to see to know that this is junk.  Watching unfit reenactors in crisp-clean uniforms who look like deer in headlights shooting BFA-equipped weapons at each other with no visible recoil or affect is just sad. By comparison, ""Combat"" looks like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and that is saying something.",1429488000,5,776,4.656934306569343
6729493,4,B00O8UI74E,"Put me on the side of ""I liked this"".  It wasn't as bad as some might make out.  While it was fairly predictable as far as the story line goes, the acting was decent and it did allow you to get behind the characters.

The gist of the story is a squad of British Commandos must be lead by an American officer who used to summer in France with grandmother.  As expected, the Brits do not take kindly to being ordered around and led by a Yank.  Eventually they come to terms with it and understand he is a suitable choice for the project.

An unexpected turn and turncoat in the ranks makes for a bit of chaos.",1428451200,,607,4.101694915254237
