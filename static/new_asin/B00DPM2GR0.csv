5843463,5,B00DPM2GR0,"Always typecast as a villain, rock singer Fish has never been so funny. Yes, the bad guy but with comic timing, ridiculous bandages and self parody lines you will see the Scottish hard man as never before. If you like quintessential British romcoms then this will be right up your street.",1378944000,2,288,4.666666666666667

5843467,5,B00DPM2GR0,"I've bought this movie when it was first released in Europe, at the Leamington convention of Fish (the singer, the poet, the actor), and I also supported the production through the fund rasing on the web.
I confess I have bought this movie only becasue of Fish, but I was impressed when I saw it: Fish is great in this movie, and the story is brilliant ! It really worths a buy !!

5843563,5,B00DPM2GR0,"This is a great little film about comics, comic obsessions and comic stores. If you're a comic fan, you should see it.

5843611,5,B00DPM2GR0,"Electric Man is a fun and original caper film revolving around a ""priceless"" comic. Shot in and around Edinburgh in Scotland this not only has a highly entertaining story but it also features some beautiful Edinburgh landmarks.",1378944000,,227,5.162162162162162
5843612,5,B00DPM2GR0,I enjoyed this fun and quirky film enormously. A real triumph for independent film makers in Britain. I would recommend this film to anyone with even a passing interest in comics.,1378944000,,179,4.806451612903226
5843613,5,B00DPM2GR0,"What can I say? FAN-BLOODY-TASTIC!!......This movie is destined to be a cult classic and will be watched in lowly student accommodation,homes,mansions,yurts,theaters etc for the next 1000 years. The cast are simply superb, with Fish and Jennifer Ewing stealing the show, and my heart(Jennifer, not Fish I might add). All the actors are absolute class actually and if this isn't nominated for every award going, then there is something truly rotten at the core of civilization.
 Who would have thought that a low budget movie such as this could provide a level of entertainment and downright joy that surpasses the so called comedy movies that appear out of the mainstream system these days. The director(Mr David Barras)should be knighted for services to the Scottish film and comic industries, and if not at least have large wads of cash thrown at him, and the rest of the crew of course,for his next project.
  So to conclude, buy and watch this movie immediately, if not sooner and support the amazing talent that Scotland has to offer the film industry.",1378944000,,1057,4.994318181818182
5843614,5,B00DPM2GR0,"Brilliant film. Great script and hilarious comic timing from Derek Dick aka Fish. Nice to see different shots of Edinburgh too. Recommended viewing, 5 stars.",1378944000,,157,5.32
5843615,5,B00DPM2GR0,"In the tradition of Bill Forsyth's 'Scottish' films, this is a really enjoyable watch. So good to see something original and fresh that is just itself, and not trying to be the next anything else. It's witty and touching and involving - and the city of Edinburgh gets a starring role. What's not to like!",1378944000,,304,4.545454545454546
5843616,5,B00DPM2GR0,"What can I say about Electric Man or where do I start?
I honestly can say that this film is a breath of fresh air to low budget made end of the market.
It has everything humour,good story,well written and produced
I saw this at a premier at a local cinema and also pre ordered the DVD as soon as I could.
There has been a few comedy/black comedy's to come from Scotland over the last few decades like Gregory's girl,restless natives and I would say electric man will also stand the time along side these gems,
Well done to the guys for coming up with the story(just because it sounds like another superhero film it's not,it's above that)
I look forward to looking out for more films in the future from david barras & Scott McKay",1378944000,5,728,4.321167883211679
5843617,5,B00DPM2GR0,"what a pleasant surprise this movie was , quirky funny and a refreshing change from the grim , superhero or crap yank chick flick blockbuster options at your local fleece pit ,set around the comic shop industry and fearuring charismatic fish the singer and simply makes the movie
,people forget in these dark days how funny and illuminating mr derek dick of haddington is when he led that band who sang kayleigh to germany for a packed crowd .but panic not the movie is standalone wonderful fun ,so do order in confidence [",1378944000,2,523,4.634408602150538

5843619,5,B00DPM2GR0,Absolutely the best Scottish film I've ever seen! Admittedly the ONLY Scottish film I've ever seen. More fun than a barrel of monkeys and a tab of purple haze. My cheeks hurt from smiling so much.,1378944000,2,196,4.472222222222222

8596069,5,B00DPM2GR0,"As much as I hate the guy who runs or is behind the till at DeadHead Comics in Edinburgh. I'm glad he got a cameo but maybe they should of pointed out in this awesomely silly but dark film how impossible it is to buy a comic from his store when he is pissed or just not interested in you... anyways back to the film.

Great casting, great fun and a really great comic romp! Glad someone is going up against the big companies with such a great story and made with a lot of love and fun

Well done... Highly recommend.",1379376000,,516,4.049019607843137

8596071,5,B00DPM2GR0,"Really enjoyed this off beat comedy filmed on location in Edinburgh,Scotland. Cast is solid. Music lovers will recognize the great vocalist/lyricist Fish in a solid supporting role. If you are a fan of Shaun Of The Dead  or Hot Fuzz,you might enjoy this indie film.",1379289600,,265,4.888888888888889
8596072,5,B00DPM2GR0,"This film is so very funny, but it is also humour that for me will never tire because of how intellectually smart it wraps the whole story together. Yey David. Good luck.",1379289600,,170,4.34375
8596073,5,B00DPM2GR0,"A really enjoyable, clever and funny Edinburgh-based, comic-geek romp! Pay attention, there's a lot going on it this film and some of the gags are subtle; I picked up a lot more on second viewing.",1379289600,,196,4.628571428571429
8596074,5,B00DPM2GR0,"This is a fantastic independent film with some real laughs. Fabulous new actors, a great script and a chance to see Edinburgh in all its glory. Comic fans will love it, but so will those who just enjoy a good comedy.",1379289600,2,216,4.2926829268292686
8596075,5,B00DPM2GR0,Don't miss this.  Quirky and proves low budget can deliver the goods!  If you missed this at Comic Con last year highly recommend you catch it on DVD.,1379289600,2,150,4.321428571428571
8596076,5,B00DPM2GR0,"A brilliant comic caper to rival Spiderman! I thought it was superbly cast including Derek Dick aka Fish as the evil Uncle Jimmy! Filmed entirely in Edinburgh, it shows the city very atmospherically. A must for comic book fans and movie buffs alike - great entertainment with a deviously hilarious storyline.",1379289600,2,308,5.0588235294117645
8596077,5,B00DPM2GR0,"Brilliant comedy set in Edinburgh (to anyone in the States, Edinburgh is in Scotchland, England) and is a very funny chase movie about a mega rare comic falling into the hands of the two skint comic shop owners.

Worth watching for the scene in the police station alone.

Brilliant movie, loads of laughs and a great twisty turny plot.

And it's got that Fish oot Marillion in it!

Git it watched or ah'll burst yi!!!",1379030400,2,417,4.52
