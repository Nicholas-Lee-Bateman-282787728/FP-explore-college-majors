I  have always been a fan of Arturo de Cordova and really never paid much attention to Yolanda Varela having seen her in another movie with Jorge Negrete & Pedro Infante in ""Dos Tipos de Cuidado"".  However in this movie.....  Wow!!! it is such a beautiful movie and Yolanda's acting was great.  I am a fan of the classic movies of La Epoca de Oro de Mexico, and this is one of them.  I am not a movie critic by far, however I know what i like and I loved this one.  I would recommend this one to anyone.

Arturo de Cordova passed away in 1973 and Yolanda Varela recently passed away in April 2009.  Both will missed very much.",1391817600,,774,4.190476190476191
