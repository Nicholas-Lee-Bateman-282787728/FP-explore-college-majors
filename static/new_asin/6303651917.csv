724463,5,6303651917,"I kind of turned off the t.v after being freaked out during the night, WHOA especially the ending, now that was so freaky, I don't remember much, a bunch of drug dealers go to a funeral home to deal some drugs or something? or they go to buy some, forgot, funny when the guy hits his head on the porch. Well I remember some stories one of dolls that kill people, and has something to do with a painting on the wall, another story of police brutality, lets leave it like that. I think anyone should watch this really interesting movie, one of my all time favs, it did scare me half to death! But I'll have to watch it again to refresh my memory!",1029369600,3,644,4.16
724464,4,6303651917,This movie is off the hook through out most of it. The beginning is pretty broing likt the first three stories are the boring ones I mean cool to watch tht first time but boring for the other times.  But the last one is the best one which shows thugs and gangstas what happens in the real thug life.  With a gangbanger named Krazy K who blames all his problems on other people till the end when he is takin to a real bad prison and Showed A clip of Black people gettin killed and the KKK killing black poeple than he is puit in a really dark room wit strobe lights that brings people he killed and he still doesnt learn and kepps repeating i don't give a ... than he wakes up and is stil saying it and gets killed. But all and all it is a good movie to watch.,1009929600,2,759,3.954248366013072
724465,4,6303651917,I really must say that the movie was pretty good.  I love the background story(three gangsters going to an old funeral home owner for weed and he tells them story as he leads them through his house)but all of the stories that he tells except the last one are not really that good.  I found a LOT more humor in this movie than scares but I have got to say it is a movie worth buying.  The dialouge between the gangsters is absolutely hilarious.  I bought the movie and I think it is certainly one to show all of your friends.,1007337600,2,524,4.158415841584159
724466,4,6303651917,"This is a horror anthology film CREEPSHOW or the HBO series TALES FROM THE CRYPT, only it is told from more of an African-American perspective.  And unlike many horror films, TftH puts together fictional horrors with real-life horrors like racism, child abuse, police brutality, and gang violence.
The story deals with three hoodlums who enter a funeral home ran by a mysterious mortician effectively played by Clarence Williams III.  The mortician, who turns out to be a lot more than just a simple mortician, tells the thugs four stories:
1.  A honest cop is tormented by the fact that he failed to save an activist's life from his corrupt superiors.
2.  An abused child is victimized by his stepfather and a monster everyone thinks is imaginary.
3.  A racist politician, modeled after David Duke, moves into a former plantation where the slave master murdered his slaves.
4.  A homicidal thug, who blames everyone except himself for his problems, undergoes a government sponsored rehabilitation program.  This story has a connection with the three thugs also.  And it has the best message out of all the stories.
For a horror film, I found TftH unusally well written and acted.  However, I do have a complaint with its treatment of white people.  It depicts white people as being skinheads, racist cops, or former Klansmen.  If the filmmakers wanted to make a statement about racism, they went about it the wrong way by demonizing white people.  Finger-pointing does not cure racism, it only aggravates it.
Overall rating : 3.75 stars.",1005264000,11,1538,4.96484375
724467,5,6303651917,"""Tales from the Hood"" is the best horror movie ever made. It freaked me out he first time i saw it (and i don't freak easy). It's about three Hood gangstas going into Mr. Simms funeral home to get some drugs. He leads them through and tells them some extremely scary stories. The first one is about a black kid on the force who sees some white cops beating on a black politician who tries to get rid of bad cops. The old black dude dies and comes back to tell the black kid, Clarence, to help him kill the white cops. The next ones are about slave dolls, an abusive father, and the best short movie about black history i've ever seen. if you only watch one story, watch the last one. WARNING: IF YOU ARE IN THE KKK, DON'T WATCH THIS.",997574400,3,733,4.1328671328671325

The issues adressed in this film are strong, and worth seeing, and Clarence Williams provides the comic relief. Good movie. Worth 4 stars.",982368000,,311,4.886792452830188

724822,5,6303651917,"A classic in its own right, Tales From the Hood ruled my childhood and became a movie that I watched time and time again. Its iteration of life in the ghetto covers many bases such as racism, brutality and much more mixed in with some devilish Tales From The Crypt-like stories, Its got just the right amount of humor in it and u won't believe how it ends.

While many will avoid this b/c of its connection to Spike Lee, assuming that it takes one position and shoves it down your throat, they would be doing themselves a disservice not to view it.

While the CGI is dated, the stories are not. In 2017, the very themes in each vignette are still alive and well in the United States. Irrespective of your political ideology, you will find something here to connect with and discuss.

If you are an educator, post  - secondary, give thought to using this to connect to current themes. You may well have to explain who David Duke is; but, it's an opportunity to discuss, using film, the politics of race.

Police brutality, school bullying, the KKK and last but not least gang violence all make up the quartet of the ""tales "".

725546,1,6303651917,"I remember seeing this film as a teenager and decided to give it a watch just recently for nostalgia purposes. Seeing this again through the eyes of an adult really make me see it for what it is... one of the most, if not most, racist films against white people there are. The first 'tale' involves a young black officer that witnesses police brutality against a black rights activist (done by a white officer of course). The second story shows a racist senator (played by Corbin Bersen) that gets punished by getting eaten alive by a bunch of black dolls. The third tale involves a common thug gangbanger getting arrested and going through a 'process' to get ""rehabilitated"" which is a total rip-off of 'A Clockwork Orange' (and was it really necessary for the subject to be wearing bikini underwear with a sock stuffed in it)?. During this process, he is being shown why it is wrong to kill other black people. How about teaching him the simple fact that it's wrong to kill people PERIOD?
The entire film shines a very negative light on whites and is basically reverse racism. I have zero respect for any of the white actors involved who contributed to making this film, especially Corbin Bernsen.",1445472000,4,1199,4.687203791469194

I was very impressed by the director, Rusty Cundieff, for the way he went about story telling in this one. I was also interested to learn that spike lee was executive producer on this HBO film.

725806,4,6303651917,"Crooked cops, domestic abuse, bigotry, and gang violence... Life ain't easy growing up in the hood, as three gang bangers are about to find out after they enter the funeral home of the sadistic Mr. Simms looking for their stolen loot. While there, Simms tells them the four horrifying tales surrounding the deaths of his most recent 'customers.' The first involves a political activist who returns from the grave to exact his revenge against the corrupt policemen that killed him. Up next, a young boy is left to defend himself against the monster living in his house when his parents and teachers don't believe his stories. When a racist politician moves into an old plantation, the ghosts of the past strike back using the bodies of the small slave dolls that were buried beneath the house. Finally, a hardcore gangster is given the chance to reform in prison, where he is faced with the ghosts of his victims during the extreme treatments.

TALES FROM THE HOOD gives an urban edge to the horror anthology. The film weds the harsh realities of A Spike Lee Joint with the classic stylings of the EC comics. Although the moralistic overtone can be heavy-handed at times, the lessons learned are quite effective and extremely relevant to the times in which they were made. The stance against black-on-black crime that appears in the fourth installment bears far more weight that the other three, but each of the tales prove to be fun and exciting. Director Rusty Cundieff does a wonderful job bringing his script to the screen, and handles the anthology format with all the skill and precision of an Amicus picture. David Alan Grier joins the cast in a splendidly atypical performance as Carl ""The Monster,"" and Clarence Williams is a ghoulish delight as the crazy-eyed caretaker. The special effects are top-rate for a film of its size, with major props going to the tiny terrors in the third short that can't help but recall miniature versions of the Zuni fetish doll from TRILOGY OF TERROR. Overall, TALES FROM THE HOOD is one of the best anthology features to come out of the 90's, and a real treat for Horror fans!

725814,4,6303651917,"If there is one thing the brothers Sid have an affinity for, it'd be a film composed of short scary stories. Maybe it has something to do with our childhood shows like Tales From the Darkside or it's slightly more b cousin Monsters. As a youth Sid couldn't get enough of these shows. Sprinkle in Creepshow 1 & 2, vamanos Pancho, and we were officially hooked on the concept. See what this does is eliminate all the typical horror movie filler, which cuts out the chance for boredom. Like when the film hits a lull and you and your buddy start staring at a wormhole for an hour while listening to Hello it's Me. See with short stories you don't have this happen. So Sid figured why not revisit a film we caught bit's and pieces of years prior? Plus, being from 1995-1 year post&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>, it falls into the 90's B category which we're always happy to entertain.

Tales from the Hood moves in similar fashion to Creepshow, just with some more color friendly material. Being that we're 2% Spanish elf we were fine with that. The film begins with a few hoods/street toughs getting a creepy tour of a funeral parlor run by an insane Charlie. MC Hammer daddy. As he gives them the tour he proceeds to tell them four scary stories. Our favorite short was one containing little slave puppets and a White power Corben Bernsen. There is obviously no scarier concept then a handful of puppets, containing the souls of angry slaves, on a vengeful killing spree. It's a heavy story but really creepy and very B. Corben plays his finest role since his mindblowing performance in the Sid Favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dentist/dp/630512003X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dentist</a>. The other stories were also very entertaining, and one even contained a zombie Mr. Morgan.

So as you can see Sid was surely a fan of Tales from the Hood, or it's European title ""Buy Another One you Rich Mutha..."" The stories were some cleverly complied ideas. Now with a film that was so entertaining Sid could only wonder ""why wasn't there a sequel made?"" The very same question we've asked about Merry Xmiss for years now. Clearly there is a market for short story horror flicks. So why not hook our brother friends up with some more horror outside of Leprechaun in the Hood. Even B legend Ice-T couldn't save that nightmare. Well that part where their banged out a J was pretty cool, but other than that NO DEAL. We may even start our own sequel script after we wrap up Death Ring 2: Island of B. Now that we're in Sidtember with Rogtober approaching we must suggest you add Tales from the Hood to your Halloween time viewing choices.",1316131200,3,2797,5.025862068965517

The first tale concerns a man murdered by crooked police officers and the officer who begins hearing his voice from beyond the grave to avenge his death. The second story deals with a boy named Walter, the monster who torments him, and the teacher who realizes that something is wrong.

Finally, the fourth story deals with a career criminal who agrees to undergo a horrific behavioral modification program overseen by a government-employed scientist.  The stories each become gradually scarier as Mr. Simms go on and as the drug dealers begin to lose their patience, until they are ultimately given what they have come for, and find that there is something much more evil to the funeral home than they ever realized.

725897,4,6303651917,"I rented this when it first came out at 15 years old. My mom and I got thru the first two stories and due to the language and freaky violence, we turned it off. What's ironic, is from the case, I thought it was a comedy, boy! Was I ever wrong!
In the past several years, I've watched it a few more times, despite the language, I enjoy it now, I guess SL is rather well known for constant profanity, the only tale I'm still not too crazy about is the one before the end, I like how boys do get bruised concludes-let's just say the abuser gets their just desserts. The main ending was cool, but not completely original. Mr. Simms played by Clarence Williams III has a little surprise of his own by the films conclusion, some viewers may expect it, some may not,but either way, the stories leading up to the end, one by one, the first one involving bad/racist cops, seems sinister enough, but after that one, you tend to think ""how can they top this?"" With each story, the evils of predjudice becomes more clear-esp. in the 4th one, now I'm rather hard to scare, but to this day, that one creeps me out!
I'm no expert, but this is my opinion: this film is worth a look, and worth having in your horror film collection. I didn't get it from here, but from another website, the condition was almost flawless and it arrived in quick time.
I like several different kinds of horror flicks, but the slasher flicks-excluding Saw) are losing their touch to me.
Re-makes and sequels can be good if done right, but to re-make this, Spike Lee would probably not go for it, but you never know. Of course, Rob Zombie re-made Halloween and the first sequel, and they were fairly decent. A remake for this though, maybe hard to do, but hopefully they wouldn't do it scene for scene.

725928,5,6303651917,"In an experience more frightening than their worst nightmares, three friends tour a funeral home with a creepy mortician (Clarence Williams III) in this Spike Lee-produced horror anthology. Along the way, they hear a story about each of the corpses. From cops turned bad to a child with uncanny powers, a bigoted politician tormented by voodoo dolls and a drug dealer who undergoes sensory rehab, all of the spooky tales have racial implications.

As always, there's controversy when it comes to a Spike Lee production. Personally, I understand that when I fire up ""a Spike Lee joint"" (no pun intended - that's the logo on his films) - I know what I'm in for. A well made, well acted, sometimes imaginative film with some pretty heavy racially biased overtones. That's pretty much it. Such is the case with this movie. It has everything you would expect from a ""Tales From the Crypt"" parody set in the ""hood"". The production values are tight and the acting is of a higher standard than Tales from the Crypt (the one with Stephen King).

I was glad to see Clarence (Mod Squad) Williams III working again (he was excellent) and I enjoyed the menacingly dramatic change of pace characterization from David Allen Grier. There were some creepy moments and some humorous ones - what else would you want from this type of movie. So if you're not inclined to whine about heavy-handed prejudiced moralizing and can accept a decent horror flick at face value - this one was worth it. It has its underlying themes of racism, child abuse and gang related murders mixed together with horror style story telling. There should've been a sequel!",1185235200,,1629,4.7935943060498225

725930,3,6303651917,"While this film hasn't won any Oscars it's important viewing for some.  Yes the tales within are moralistic but sorley needed at the time the film was released.  The most important of the tales is the story of the gangbanger who becomes a victim of his own violence.  Laying on the ground bleeding and dying, the young brother is offered a chance at redemption and salvation.  He is placed in a facility for behavioral modification.  He finds himself placed in a cell next to a white supremist skin head.  The skinhead taunts the young brother and basically tells him that he likes him.  Why?  Because he's doing the supremists job for him.  He's killing other black youths that the skin head wants to get rid of any way.  After that the gangbanger is forced to watch images of dead African Americans who have been shot, lynched, and beaten to death.  Some by the KKK and some by black on black crime.  The scenes are very graphic.  The last treatment for this criminal is sensory deprevation.  His mind feeds on itself and produces images of the people that he has killed either accidentally or purposely.  He refuses to be turned and give up his violent ways.  The doctor that tries to modify his behavior is really an angel who is trying to get him to heaven but the gangbanger is too blinded by hatred and violence to see it.  The scene returns back to the street where the punk still lies.  The gang members that shot him shoot him again.  He dies and goes exactly where you think he goes.  To hell.

There is quite a bit of foul language and lots of violence in the film but that's what our young people go to the movies for these days.  I've got to believe that at least one young person got the message here.  Hopefully, not just the black kids but all the others too.  I applaud this films efforts even if it's not the most wonderful film in all of film making history.  One more important note.  There was still time for the gangbanger to repent and go to heaven even though he had killed many and was dying himself.  As long as there is life, there is a chance to change.  Even the thief that was being crucified on the cross next to Jesus was welcomed into heaven that very day.  It doesn't matter what you've done as long as you repent and accept the gift He's given!

All the anthology horror movies I have seen bear one similar characteristic in that each has its moments of excellence and each has more than its share of weakness. This movie manages to keep that trend very well. We meet three toughs named Ball, Stack and Bulldog who have broken into a funeral home looking for a stash of drugs. They encounter a cadaverous Mr. Simms (Clarence Williams III of the original ""Mod Squad""), who proceeds to give the three lads a tour of the facilities. During the tour Mr. Simms shows the young men a series of corpses. Remember the old pirate line ""dead men tell no tales?"" Apparently in this movie the dead speak, through Mr. Simms.

A word of warning about this movie; there are a lot of curse words hurled about with great frequency. Apparently some people have difficulty expressing themselves with the largest language on the planet, so they resort to an elite vocabulary of four-letter words; perhaps as many as two or three dozen of these words. If such vocal expressions offend your sensibilities you may wish to pass this movie by.

In the first tale we meet Martin Morehouse (Tom Williams), a black activist who has been enthusiastically crusading against police violence in the ghetto. We also learn that Clarence Morehouse, Martin's brother, is a police officer. One terrible evening three white police officers murder Martin. Unfortunately for Clarence, Clarence knows about the murder, but does nothing. You know that the dead rest uneasy in movies like this, and Martin is no exception. After one of the cops takes a potty break on Martin's tombstone, Martin returns from the grave to get a little justice. Apparently brotherly love does not extend beyond the grave, because Martin also enacts a bit of revenge on his brother as well.

In the second tale we meet Walter (Brandon Hammond), who is regularly abused by a ""monster"" at night. Walter's teacher tries to help, and then nearly becomes a victim herself. What none of them knows is that Walter has power of his own; a power to do good in the most awful way.

In the third tale we meet a politician who has made the mistake, as many of us do, of buying a house in the wrong neighborhood. In this case the man is a racist and a former Klansman and the house was the scene of a lynching a hundred years earlier. The souls of those who were murdered were transferred into twelve dolls that were then located on the property, still waiting for a chance to exact their revenge.

In the fourth tale we meet a man who has committed horrible crimes, and has a chance to be rehabilitated through a most bizarre and unnerving technique. Perhaps he would have been better off choosing execution.

As the fourth tale draws to an end, Mr. Simms finally reveals his true identity (which most assuredly does not involve a large ""S"" and red, white and blue tights), and the movie ends with a typical anthology twist.

This movie is okay from a horror viewpoint, if somewhat unoriginal in aspects. The first tale had a predictable ending, and yet I found it satisfying. Regardless of whether you are superstitious, it seems unwise to take a leak on someone's tombstone. I really liked the second tale and thought it worked well. I also did not know how this tale would play out until the tale was near the end. I also liked the third tale. The evil little dolls were well animated and creepy, and remind one and all not to mess with a grudge, as another movie reminded us again recently. The fourth tale was a little weak, I thought. It reminded me a bit of a bizarre ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but not done as well.

I really enjoyed Clarence Williams III as Mr. Simms. I could readily see Williams hosting his own television show or perhaps having a movie centered about a Simms-like character. I would watch it.

While I liked more than half this movie, the four-letter words annoyed me a lot. There were points where I felt uncomfortable with my wife watching this with me, and I asked whether she wanted me to watch something else. However, she is a horror movie fan too and waded through the four-letter words to enjoy the better parts of this movie.

The best parts of this movie are quite good. I enjoyed the little dolls. They reminded me particularly of Rod Serling's old ""Night Gallery"" series and another anthology, ""Trilogy of Terror."" I also thought the tale with the boy and his monster was quite good, especially because I was unable to predict the ending. As horror anthologies go, this one is probably just a bit above average, but the average is generally not good. However, if you have yet to see any horror anthologies, this one is acceptable if you can get past the language. Beware of Mr. Simms!",1125360000,2,4749,4.629453681710213
725933,3,6303651917,"It's ""Creepshow"" meets ""Menace II Society"" as a mortician takes three drug dealers on a tour of his mortuary. But with each dead body is a story, each more gruesome than the next. The first involves a squad of crooked cops who murder a community activist, only to be haunted by his ghost. The second surrounds a young pre-teen boy and his fear of the ""Monster"" at home. The third involves a racist politician who decides to reside in a former plantation where the spirits of the tormented slaves are trapped in tiny dolls. The fourth and final tale surrounds a violent gang-banger, convicted of several murders in his community, who is offered both release and redemption if he completes a bizarre goverment-funded rehabilitation program. There is an interesting social commentary provided here comparing the black-on-black violence committed by the lead to the horrible murders of the Klu-Klux Klan and other white supremacy organizations. The first three-quarters of ""Hood"" don't offer much outside of an urban twist on familiar ""horror anthology"" concepts but the final act is where the movie really shines with a conclusion that you won't be able to forget. The DVD edition includes a featurette, trailer, and TV spots.",1125187200,2,1223,5.0594059405940595
725934,3,6303651917,"Anyway you slice it, 'Tales From The Hood' appears, to me like an African-American version of 'Tales From The Crypt'. However, the film is still a very decent find. It features four (4) rather gruesome tales of racism. My favorite was the fourth story,'Sweets To The Sweet' where a state governor (or soon-to-be elected) tries to avoid the long slain spirits of slaves that were murdered on the very property in which his residence stands. He notices these 'spirits' keep popping out from the painting that graces the wall of his office. Good doll animated action there. Most memorable scene: where Mr. Simms / The Devil (Clarence Williams III - Linc from 'The Mod Squad') transforms himself into Satan as he spurts out to three homies with guns that refuse to accept the fact that they're already dead, ""Welcome to hell, mother-f**kers!"". Certainly not for young children to see. A good horror flick.",1117152000,3,901,4.895424836601308
725935,3,6303651917,"All right, obviously originality isn't the strong point in the film Tales from the Hood (1995), but it does have enough inspiration to get past being labeled a black Tales from the Crypt horror anthology (revenge tales with a racial spin are still revenge tales).  Now, I had seen this film in the theater when it originally came out some ten years ago, and haven't seen it again since recently.  I did remember most of what happened in the film, but the one thing that I had forgotten about was how much profanity was actually in the movie.  I'm not a prude, but I think it's important to throw that out there if you have a problem with characters cursing ad nauseam (I suppose the argument could be made this reflects a certain aspect of society, so I can deal with it)...written and directed by Rusty Cundieff (Fear of a Black Hat, Sprung), with Spike Lee listed as executive producer, the film features Clarence `Linc' Williams III (The Mod Squad, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka), Joe Torry (House Party 3, Sprung), Wings Hauser (Vice Squad, Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time), David Alan Grier (Jumanji, McHale's Navy), Corbin Bernsen (Major League, The Dentist), and Rosalind Cash (The Omega Man, Uptown Saturday Night), among others...

The film is actually four separate stories bookended by a fifth...of Jack Daniels...no, by a fifth story (when I say `bookended', I mean there is a set-up story which starts the film, and then appears after each of the other stories ends, finally finishing out the film).  The film begins with a story called Welcome to My Mortuary, as three street toughs arrive at a funeral home, one run by the wild-eyed Mr. Simms (Williams).  Somehow (this aspect isn't really made clear) Mr. Simms has come into a load of drugs apparently once belonging to these three chaps, and now they've arrived to retrieve said stuff, to which they're engaged in four tales about various deceased individuals now occupying coffins within the funeral home, the first called Rogue Cop Revelation.  This one is about a group of racist cops, one played by Hauser, who take revenge on a local politician for his efforts in trying to clean up the police force by pushing for the prosecution of corrupt cops.  The do-gooder ends up getting killed, but what is buried don't always stay buried.  The 2nd tale is titled Boys Do Get Bruised and features a young boy whose teacher (looking a lot like Whoopi Goldberg with his dreadlocks) notices the signs of abuse as the boy continually shows up at school with bruises, which he claims were caused by a monster.  This one features Grier in an uncharacteristic role as an extremely rancorous individual.  The third story, titled KKK Comeuppance, features Bernsen as a racist politician/ex-klansman who buys an old plantation house in the hopes that it will assist him in winning an upcoming election.  Apparently the house has a violent history in that of a slave massacre that happened many years prior, and now the ghosts of the past have been re-awakened by the intrusion of this repugnant individual.  The fourth story, titled Hardcore Convert, is about a vicious street hood/killer who, after being captured and sentenced to life in prison, is offered a 2nd chance if he consents to a radical new program including behavioral modification techniques administered by a doctor played by Cash.  After this the initial tale, the one featuring Mr. Simms and the three gang members, comes to a spectacular and memorable conclusion.

I did enjoy this film overall, but found the slinging of racial epithets to get a bit excessive at times, especially in the first and third stories.  I know the intent was to create characters so odious and noxious that when eventually presented with their mortal fate, they would appear completely deserving, but I felt their despicable nature could have been better portrayed through a less obvious tactic.  I suppose because there were a number of different stories presented here there may not have been the time to create fully realized, three dimensional characterizations, so the director had to opt for the quick and dirty method.  Anyway, the strongest tale was the last one involving the hardcore thug named Jerome aka Crazy K, and the attempt to alter his perception by giving him an opportunity to see the never-ending path of escalating violence he, along with many others, follow often times by choice.  The imagery presented in this story is very harsh and will evoke a sense of anger and disgust, as the director uses actual photographs of past atrocities (lynchings, burnings, etc.) as Jerome undergoes a bizarre rehabilitation process.  The special effects overall looked pretty good and featured a mixture of CGI work along with some good old fashion stop motion animation.  The direction and pacing are strong, and most of the actors are very good (Clarence Williams III really drives the film with his wiggy, over-the-top performance), even if the script falters at times.  One aspect I did like was while there was focus on white racism in some of the stories, it wasn't the only motivating factor throughout as black-on-black violence is also reflected in some of the tales.  All in all this film could have been a lot worse.  There are no real surprises as the various stories don't really offer any shocking or twist endings, but it does feature a real hum dinger of an ending and some strong, moral messages that may relate to some audiences.

The widescreen non-anamorphic (1.85:1) picture looks very sharp and clear (Amazon states the aspect ratio at 1.33:1, but this wasn't the case, at least on my copy).  The audio, presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, is decent, but sometimes seems a little muddled and soft.  Special features include a `making of' featurette, theatrical trailer, TV promos, and cast and crew bios.  I give this 3  stars.
