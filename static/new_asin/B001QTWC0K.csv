3770336,4,B001QTWC0K,"Following on the smash success of ""Watchmen"" Warner Brothers Premiere  has released ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" on DVD and Blue Ray. The features laden set is truly impressive an tells the story within a story of The Black Freighter in an animated format. Fans of the graphic novel Watchmen will remember that the newsstand owner had a patron who would read a pirate adventure and that the savage tale also served as a counter point to the events happening in the Watchmen universe.

The animated feature is voiced by Gerard Butler and tells the story of a captain who is the lone survivor of an assault by a mysterious freighter. Convinced that the freighter is headed to his home, the captain faces a series of ghastly challenges to stay alive and return home. As the obstacles mount, the captain slowly starts to lose his grip on reality which leads to a startling finale.

The top flight animation serves the episode well as does Butler's solid voice work. The episode is briskly paced and runs in at roughly 3o minutes.

 Another feature of the set is the Under the Hood segment which tells the story of the original Night Owl Hollis Mason and provides a background on the world of the Watchmen. Done in the format of a television interview show, the great segment features characters from the film as they tell the story of the original Night Owl and the formation of The Minutemen and Watchmen as well as the villains they faced and the pending Keane Act.
This was a fantastic and unexpected feature of the disc and when combined with the look at the upcoming Green lantern DVD made this collection an absolute gem.",1236988800,20,1625,4.648083623693379

However, ""Under the Hood"" was the reason I bought this video, and I really enjoyed it.  I've always been a fan of documentaries, and watching this ""documentary"" lol was an enjoyable experience.  I got to learn a little more about the characters and the differences between the characters in the film and in the comic book as well as the contradictions in each.  For example, you see that the Night Owl of the film was in love with the Silk Spectre while in the comic series he was in love with Silhouette.

3770367,2,B001QTWC0K,"I loved the movie Watchmen, and thought that the director's choices were excellent--deeply respectful of the original graphic novel, but recognizing that a graphic novel and a film are different media and require different solutions to be successful.  This is not the place to discuss the decision to change the ending of Watchmen; but the decision to eliminate the story within a story of the Black Freighter was certainly a necessary one, if only due to time constraints.  Naturally, Watchmen devotees and completists wanted that missing material; and now it is available as a stand-alone.  Unfortunately, Tales of the Black Freighter doesn't work terribly well as a stand-alone.  In the graphic novel, Tales was not presented as a whole, but instead quite broken up--only a few panels at a time, and those with commentary from the outside, ""real"" world superimposed on them.  Tales in the graphic novel isn't a stand-alone, it's another commentary on the themes in the main story.  This is all lost in the DVD, although again, great care is taken to be respectful of the source material, even to the extent of drawing sharks very badly.  Rumors abound that a version of Watchmen will be released with Tales integrated into the story as it was in the graphic novel.  I can't imagine it will work.

Of course, Tales isn't actually packaged as a stand-alone--it's paired with ""Under the Hood"", an interview program with the some of the characters of Watchmen.  Under the Hood is derived from the prose excerpts of Hollis Mason (Night Owl I) and greatly expanded.  Most interesting of the new material is the interview with Moloch, and especially his comment about the counterpart to Dr. Manhattan.  It's interesting for completists, but seems over-long, and adds almost nothing to the story.

There are a couple more extras: a 'motion comic' version of the first chapter of Watchmen that's pretty crappy animation (basically stills from the book) with bad voice acting that proves how badly Watchmen could have been done; and a ""Making of"" about Tales and Hood, plus ads for other movies.

Oh, and there's the song ""Pirate Jenny"" from Three-Penny Opera, from which the Black Freighter takes its name and inspiration at the end of Tales. If you don't know what it is, it seems wildly out of place.

So basically, here are extras that should have been packaged with the original DVD.  I paid full price, and feel cheated.",1312761600,,2419,4.921182266009852

3770370,4,B001QTWC0K,"As a newly introduced fan to the Watchmen Comic novel, I have to say I thoroughly  enjoyed the Captain's tale against the Black Freighter but I appreciated the story even more so in the ""Watchmen Motion Comic"" because one could see the parallels in both stories.  That of the captain and the watchmen.

""Under the Hood"" was also pretty good. For those of you who have only seen the movie, you will enjoy it because it tells the story of the original super heroes  ""The Minute Men.""

So again, watchmen fan, must have.  Not that big of a fan, not so much!!!!!

You decide....",1250812800,3,574,4.461538461538462
3770371,3,B001QTWC0K,"This is an original animated feature which takes all the material from the actual Watchmen comic, and comprises it into a single short-movie. This OVA('original video animation"" to you non-otaku)is one of several animated video tie-ins to theatrically released live-action flicks like The Dark Knight, Van Helsing, and Chronicles Of Riddick. The parts of it that pertain to the film were left out for time, but mainly because they had no direct relevance to the main story. If you were to get the Watchmen Motion Comic, you'd see it as it was in the comic in relation to the events going on around the reader, who is a geek that uses pirate comics as a way to escape the sense of doom the world is heading towards in this ""doomsday clock"" alternate 1985.

Tales Of The Black Freighter is a straight-up pirate/horror story about a sea captain who is the lone survivor of an attack on his vessel by a possibly-undead band of buckaneers. He makes it to a deserted island, along with the floating remains of alot of his crew including his first mate. The captain makes a raft out of the corpses, and heads home to warn of them of the mysterious Black Freighter which threatens to destroy their town. After seriously tripping out on some bad seawater, the captain makes it back home, but under the delusion that the town has already been sacked by the pirates. He subsequently murders two innocents he believes sold his people out, and bludgeons his wife(maybe to death)who he thinks is a pirate that's invaded his home. The captain then heads out to sea while being chased by the townsfolk, only to find the Black Freighter waiting for him. This played out like a great Tales From The Crypt-styled horror comic set in a pirate world. The animation is very well done too, a little different from the type your probably used to from Bruce Timm's style though.

The other feature on this is Under The Hood, which is a live-action documentary about the life of Hollis Mason who was the first Night Owl(aka: ""Night Owl I""). This is formatted like a TV news show from 1985 which looks back at an interview they did with Mason(Stephen McHattie)back in 1977 when his book tell-all book about being a superhero was released. They talk with Mason about being in the original Minutemen, which was the Golden Age superhero team that preceeded the Watchmen. They also have the original Silk Spectre too played by the totally fine Carla Gugino, who looks hot even back in the 70s. Plus, Matt Frewer(Max Headroom)as the retired supervillain Moloch is particularly creepy. This is a great secondary feature that compliments the rest of the Watchmen movie. There's also a documentary which partially goes over the regular Watchmen movie, and the making of Under The Hood. Also included is the first episode of the Watchmen Motion Comic.",1250553600,2,2815,4.754601226993865
3770372,3,B001QTWC0K,"Being a fan of Alan Moore and Watchmen, buying the movie blue-ray, ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" cannot miss in my videoteque.
As transposition from a comic inside the novel to animated movie, loses much pathos and meaning, thru, who wich had red the novel, has clear in mind what's the story reflects.
The narrating voice of Gerard Butler is pretty amazing but I don't think it gives the right athmosphere to the context.
After all is a movie to be watched having in mind the graphic novel so I propose : read the book before watch this.

Regarding ""Under the Hood"" I found it really enjoyable, very nice reconstruction of the ambietation and characters, the whole blue-ray deserve to be buyed just for this.",1250467200,2,710,4.68
3770373,4,B001QTWC0K,"I've only just recently gotten a chance to see the theatrical version of ""Watchmen"", and while as a fan of the graphic novel, I was a little dismayed to see that the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" comic-within-the-comic was not a part of the movie, I was glad to find it -- along with an in-universe documentary based on the comics' text supplement featuring sample chapters from ""Under the Hood"", the memoirs of Hollis Mason, aka the original Nite Owl -- had been released as a direct-to-DVD supplement to the film.

For all it's horror and violence, in it's tale of a doomed sea-captain who in his quest to protect his seaside village from the pirates who murdered his crew and sank his ship becomes as horrible a monster as the pirates, the Black Freighter is an odd and complicated counterpoint to the Watchmen story. In some ways it mirrors every shade of the moral greyness of the main story, but in other ways it seems more simple. It manages to captures, in a distilled yet more potent way, the theme of Watchmen, how even the most morally upright person trying to make the world a better place can, if they hyperfocus too much on their goal, fall to the level of the antagonists they face. The animation, a combination of hand-drawing and computer graphics, might seem a little simple, but it fits the style that the original comic presented, which was deliberately cruder and a bit garishly colored when compared to the drawing style of the main story. Gerard Butler, the voice of the doomed captain, gave his performance just the right level of despairing hope and madness.

""Under the Hood"" almost can stand by itself, but I felt the Black Freighter feature, as excellent a piece as it is, seemed to fall a little short without the Watchmen story to both frame and mirror it. The one is as much a counterpoint to the other and separating them. Much as I enjoyed watching it in this format, I'm really looking forward to seeing the director's cut version of the full movie.",1249516800,2,1984,4.61756373937677

3770375,2,B001QTWC0K,"I have been anticipating what I call the real version of the movie: with the comic and the book intermixed in the theatrical release.  I'm actually 10x's more upset about the fact that it is not interspersed as a bonus feature on the Director's cut than the fact I have to pay more for it.  I'm actually not even going to buy either the Director's cut nor this separate disk. I will however buy a future set if the fans are finally given what we were lead to believe we would be given.

Granted it would be nice to see all the other scenes from the main story line that are put into the director's cut but I'm too disapointed to even try.  Up until now I've only been critical of changing the ending (but even that I understand) and leaving out the original Nite Owl's death (this I don't understand...it was already a long movie whats a few more minutes).  I actually thought the acting was done well...any personality flaws of the characters should be addressed to Mr. Moore because I think they portrayed the characters in the book pretty spot on.  I understand why the side stories were left out yet we were told that they would be put in for the dvd release.  Finally a more complex comic book is faithfully visually rendered!

To be honest, I only bought it because Gerard Butler was the voice of one of the main characters, and I am a big Gerard Butler fan, but this was exciting and graphic and I loved the artwork.  It got here really fast too.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",1247184000,,365,3.958904109589041
3770377,5,B001QTWC0K,"A nice companion to the film itself that deepens and expands upon the underlying themes of the story by adding further layers of richness and texture to what can only be described as a meticulously fleshed out fictional reality. That fictional universe becomes more and more relevant to our own the more thought and time one is willing to commit to Watchmen, and the more one is willing to deconstruct aspects of the real-world and the comic world and dwell upon the insights and observations that Watchmen so vividly and artfully convey.

The Black Freighter takes the form of an animated parable, a story-within-a-story, that draws upon and mirrors the main plot in a haunting fashion. The animation is quite good and different enough to stand on its own. The other feature here is ""Under the Hood"", a TV news show documentary that was made to be part of the film and features interviews with some of the characters and gives various additional plot queues and further develops not only the characters themselves, but the history and context of the alternate world (and alternate timeline) they live in. I'm reminded of the way Robocop used in-movie faux news broadcasts and commercials to bring its vision of a not-so-distant dystopic future to life while also making certain cultural criticisms of the film more readily apparent. In a similar fashion, Under the Hood and Black Freighter take Watchmen beyond the limits of mere narrative story-telling, and use this power as a means to heighten the story's core metaphors and analyses--namely, the moral and social deconstruction of ""heroes"" (super and non super), the paradoxical relationship between human ethics and human nature, and the seemingly irreconcilable relationship between the individual and modern mass society. The struggle to maintain order and emotional or even philosophical consistency within a chaotic and often irrational universe and the meaning and value of the human experience in such a universe is a critical problem that the story continually brings to light and examines, and these features further expound these ideas with both creativity and elegance.

These features were removed from the theatrical release due to concerns about running time, which is a real shame considering that they represent such a considerable artistic effort, attention to detail, and a most impressive commitment to staying true to the original graphic novel. Whether they are worth viewing by themselves will depend on how much you liked the film and how interested you will be in seeing more pieces of that world fall into place. There's some nice documentary content covering the creation of these pieces and their removal as well, and fans will appreciate that.

Supposedly, these features are to be reunited with the film in the director's cut version due out shortly. I suspect that this might be too much for some more passive viewers, while those more impressed with the original will appreciate the extra depth they provide. But it is yet to be seen whether the editing will he able to include these features in a way that feels ""natural"" as a part of the film. I would therefore recommend seeing both versions, once available. As a movie buff, however, I'm really excited to see someone pushing the envelope this much in terms of what this medium is capable of and how fiction can be much more than just a linear narrative. I'm not a fan of Zack Snyder (I hated his other work), but he deserves significant props for what he's undertaken here, as any typical director would have simply cut such extraneous material without a second thought and watered this film down to something much simpler and much less interesting. The theatrical release of Watchmen was engrossing enough as it was, but the addition of these features transcends the traditional limitations of film as a medium and elevates what was merely a very good movie to a level of storytelling that can only be described as a completely immersive fictional experience. After watching this DVD, I cannot wait to watch the film a second time and I'm even more excited to see how the director's cut comes together and these materials are returned where they belong. While I withhold judgment on the success of that reassembly, I expect and hope the whole will be much more than the sum of its parts, and with such loving care and so much attention to detail given to the creation of the parts themselves, the resulting whole has the potential to be a cinematic accomplishment of the highest order.",1246320000,6,4527,4.961791831357049

3770380,2,B001QTWC0K,"Tales of the Black Freighter is an animated featurette voiced by Gerard Butler.  Butler is a great choice for the voice of the captain, but the feature would have been far better (and of course far more expensive, which is no doubt why it wasn't done) if it had been stylized live-action, perhaps 300-style.  Some of the new content (not in the comic books) is interesting and works well.  The environmental art is done well, but the character animation is not.

The worst part, and the least excusable, is that, at somewhere between 20 and 25 minutes, much of the story's content from the original comics is unnecessarily either left out or shortened to the point of losing its effect, including some of the best parts and dialog from the original.

It does a decent job of conveying the story and atmosphere of the original in animated form and a short span of time, but not to any extent which would make it worth the price.  Black Freighter will be woven into the DVD's ""Ultimate"" release, which is supposed to come out sometime around Christmas, well after the Director's Cut of Watchmen is release in July (without Freighter).

When I did so I was introduced to the concept of a superhero that does not always do the right things and does not always save the world without so much as a single casualty.  I was introduced to men and women who are flawed in many ways, but who had the skills and the charisma to do what they considered the right thing to do for the benefit of the world's people's. Within the pages of Watchmen was a side story that mirrored the main story and it was called ""Tales of the Black Freighter."" Though I read through the story of a shipwrecked sea captain whose determination to save his loved ones drove him to the brink, I felt that the dvd brought new life to the story. In the graphic novel you are focused on the Watchmen story while this other one slides in and out of focus. With the story being told in one cohesive storyline along with Gerard Butlers emotional narration made me really feel and care for this story and its bitter ending. I would also suggest this dvd for people who are also just simply looking for  good emotional story telling. The ""Under The Hood"" documentry ,if that is what you could call it,is also an interesting piece to watch for fans of the movie or graphic novel and it also makes this alternate timeline that the novel and movie are based around feel real by adding in commercial breaks with referances for people who know their ""Watchmen.""",1242604800,,1495,4.413043478260869

3770384,4,B001QTWC0K,"By this point we all know about the new live action super hero movie, Watchmen. We have all experienced the hype around it and even if we haven't seen it yet, we all have the urge to see it eventually. Those who, like me, have not read the comics will be very unaware as to what ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" is all about.

Within the comics, Tales of the Black Freighter is told as a comic within a comic which within the Watchmen series is known as ""Marooned"". This short animation focuses around a Mariner Captain who is the soul survivor of his ship which is attacked and destroyed by the murderous crew of the Black Freighter. Stranded on an island amongst the dead, rotting corpses of his fellow sea men, he becomes desperate to get to his homeland before the Black Freighter to warn his family of their impending arrival.

He proceeds to construct a raft out of the corpses and the broken pieces of his destroyed ship. On his journey, thanks to the starvation and reclusion he endures during his trip, the captain delves deeper and deeper into insanity to the point if which he starts to have conversations with one of the corpses that make up his raft.

Gerard Butler of ""300"" fame lends his voice to this feature as the captain who narrates the entire piece, as well as lending a bit of voice acting to it in the dialogue between the captain and his dead friend. The voice acting is haunting, yet effective. It remains almost monotonous throughout and somehow helps to maintain this idea that, thanks to his desperation to get home before the freighter, his mind seems to deteriorate more and more.

The animation is also something that is used to its maximum potential in a way that presents a realistic picture, without becoming overly detailed. There are a number of moments that I think the depiction of gore is a bit much, but I believe that the Watchmen movie and its accompanying short film keep extremely loyal to the comic, so it's understandable why it would be depicted in a way.

The whole idea about the way in which the mind of the captain is displayed in this feature is ultimately very clever. The reason it's frightening as it's not just a focus on the individual character, but more of an observation into human insanity in general and what levels we would stoop to in situations of pure desperation. This engagement of the captain's mind is also made that much more effective in the way the entire story is narrated by the fantastic Gerard Butler.

I would say that you're best waiting until the Watchmen movie DVD comes out as I believe this will be included with it as a sort of set. As a stand alone DVD I don't really see the point, but it certainly was an entertaining watch, even if it is only about half an hour long.",1240876800,4,2753,4.496

Which is fine if the visionary director of 300 actually had a vision.  Tales of the Black Freighter, aka Freighter, is an episode, a 38 minute feature that leads to nothing and really says nothing.  Sure they got Gerard Butler, but may I remind you this is the same actor that did P.S. I Love You and the Phantom of the Opera, anything for money, which is a good summary of the Freighter, anything for money.  The story is a simple one and one not worthy of its own DVD, as the captain of a destroyed ship and a massacre crew, victims of the Black Freighter.  The captain survives on the backs of all his dead crew men as he ventures from the solitude of a deserted island and back home, a place he believes has or is going to fall victim to the Black Freighter.  And that's it, the captain eventually gets home, but his experience has changed him.  And for 38 minutes this is the feature.  Is it worth the money?  No, not even if it is the visionary director of 300 making this feature.  And like many others who have reviewed this cash grab, by the visionary director of 300, this should have been additional content on the movie DVD or even the animated graphic novel.  Either way this is a disappointment with the notion that this adds something to the movie and original story-line which it kinda does, but as an independent DVD that is diffused, the connection was there in the graphic novel DVD when the man was reading excerpts.  But like anything based on a graphic novel or comic book character, the publisher smelled the blood in the water much like the sharks, unfortunately, the story has no teeth so it's more of a gummer rather than the definitive secondary story-line within the Watchmen.  This is a good addition to those individuals who were swept up into the mania of the Watchmen, but really this isn't a story that or a DVD that had to see the light of day.",1240012800,,2014,4.381720430107527

The casual fan probably won't be into this, as 2:45 of the film was probably enough.  This disc contains an animated version of ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" (the story-within-the-story) as well as a 35 min or so ""Under the Hood"" mockumentary, plus some behind the scenes stuff.  It seems like a lot of dough for stuff you may only watch once, though, unless you're inclined to keep revisiting this material.  Supposedly, the 3:20 cut of Watchmen that's planned for DVD will incorporate the Black Freighter stuff, so the question is if there's going to be a disc release that also rolls in any/all extras that you'd get here (which would render this a redundant purchase down the line)?

3770391,3,B001QTWC0K,"There are all kinds of things that make WATCHMEN a unique graphic novel.  One thing is the comic book story within the comic, TALES OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER.  Even though the comic within the comic is important to WATCHMEN, it's not crucial to the story's plot.  However, Zach Snyder really was dedicated to bringing the complete novel to life and had TALES OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER filmed separately as an animated short.  The short follows the story from the comic extremely well.  Also included on the DVD is the faux television newsmagazine, the Culpepper Minute, which takes a retrospective look at Hollis Mason and his best-selling memoir, ""Under the Hood"".  Great care was taken to put these features in their proper perspective of the greater world of WATCHMEN.

As a fan of both the graphic novel and the movie, I really enjoyed both TALES OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER and UNDER THE HOOD.  However, after watching the ""Story Within a Story: The Books of Watchmen"" I learned that the directors cut DVD of WATCHMEN will include TALES OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER interspersed between the action of the film, just as it is the book.  While I was excited to learn about this, I was disappointed that the studio and filmmakers released this DVD as a separate DVD and are selling it for the price of a two-disc full-length animated film (on average $20).  If you're a fan of the movie and comic, these features are worth watching, but they aren't worth the DVD is currently selling for.

Besides TALES OF THE  BLACK FREIGHTER, UNDER THE HOOD, and the ""Story Within a Story"" featurette, the DVD also includes the first episode of the Watchmen Motion Comic as well as a preview for the upcoming Green Lantern DVD.

TALES OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER is a wonderful supplement that fans of the movie and comic will enjoy.  Not only that, but animation fans will probably even enjoy watching TALES OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER just on its own merits.  However, all of the ""features"" on this DVD are really just extras that shouldn't have been sold separately and just included on the WATCHMEN DVD.

The problem is that for $25 you only get an hours worth of content.  The Motion Comic is about the same price and it's 5 hours long!  This is something that would make for cool bonus material on the The Watchmen movie dvd, but it's not long enough to be a stand alone release.

3770394,3,B001QTWC0K,"This DVD is a worthwhile supplement to The Watchmen feature film. I feel that the Under the Hood short will entertain fans of the film more than the Black Freighter animated short.

My issues with the Black Freighter feature may lie with its format. Instead of being interwoven with the main story arc, as it is in the graphic novel, we are viewing it in its entirety here. As a result, I feel that we lose some of the suspense and foreboding, that for me came with being fed the narrative in pieces. As, I have read, that this story is first and foremost allegory to the main narrative, and therein might lie the problem. As a stand alone story, it is entertaining, but unspectacular. But, when we inevitably (hopefully) get the deluxe edition of the film, with all elements once again interwoven, it will be interesting to see what effect this has on each of the stories.

The animation is beautiful and brutal. Gerard Butler's performance is solid, but like his performance in RocknRolla, his performance seems to hit the ceiling early, and stay there. My exposure to Butler is limited to 300, RocknRolla, and Tales. I haven't really felt any complexity to his performances. In 300, he nailed the character, but his other two performance seem to fill a role more then elevate the character.

I think the Under the Hood feature is superior, and hits he right vibe of the source material. It left me wanting more. The Black Freighter left me wanting more, but only because I thought it simply needed more in order to build the tension and help sell the main character's descent into madness.",1238284800,2,1592,4.658362989323844
3770395,4,B001QTWC0K,"Despite its flaws, I enjoyed Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic Watchmen, and I wholeheartedly believe that Snyder's interpretation of the material is the most faithful film adaptation that there could have been.  Case in point, Tales of the Black Freighter, which takes the comic within the comic read by the young man at the news stand, and transforms it into an animated tale.  Featuring the voice of Gerard Butler, Tales of the Black Freighter is beautifully animated and wonderfully done overall, with enough attention paid to it to make it as relevant to the film as the story was to the comic it appeared in.  Even better however is the Under the Hood documentary, derived from the prose sections of Watchmen that bookended each chapter in the story, and features Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, detailing past events.  There's a lot to enjoy here with this DVD, however considering that Snyder will eventually re-edit into his Ultimate Director's Cut of Watchmen somewhere down the line, there really isn't much point in picking this up.  Despite that though, whether you are a longtime Watchmen lover or are a newcomer thanks to the film, Tales of the Black Freighter & Under the Hood are definitely worth seeing at the very least, and if this doesn't strengthen the idea that Snyder truly does appreciate the material he's drawn from, then nothing ever will.",1237939200,4,1403,4.927966101694915

NOT, at the quality of the ~25 minute graphic epic, NOT, at the documentary style ""Under the Hood"" special, but the very fact that they asked me for 25 of my hard earned dollars for something that could have and SHOULD have been supplementary content on the Watchmen Bluray. I'm astounded.  I feel cheated, ripped off, angered.

DO NOT waste your money on this.  If you must, rent it.  The short Pirate feature is entertaining for sure, and fun.  The Hollis Mason documentary is slow moving, but chock full of additional info and plays to the fans.

As such, the price is a bit steep, which is the only reason I've rated this at four stars instead of five. Tales is beautifully rendered and voiced. Under the Hood is a bit slow, but then it was all text in the book, and in essence provided a break in the pacing of the story, so I'm not sure that this is a mark against it.

A note on Blu-Ray: Tales is supposed to feel like a comic book. The Animation harkens back to 1970s/80s fare such as Heavy Metal, and really doesn't benefit from the hyper-sharpened, line-for-line picture of my Blu-Ray copy. I'd actually suggest DVD format for this one if you have a less than 40"" TV or a good upscaling DVD player.

Tales of the Black Freighter was remarkable, grisly, and just plain cool. Even if you don't like pirate stories, guaranteed you'll dig this. It's a story about survival, the need to save others and the consequences of choosing that path, and what might happen to a man who becomes so obsessed with an ideal that he runs the risk of distorting reality completely.

Under the Hood was equally well done. Done as a ""look back"" magazine television show--complete with commercial breaks with products in the Watchmen graphic novel--it explores the origin of the superhero fraternity through the very realistic eyes and humble spirit of Hollis Mason. You forget that it's fiction quite easily and the segment also has that nostalgic feel of the Watchmen movie.

Also included is the very cool motion comic of the first chapter of the Watchmen graphic novel. This was just plain cool and the animation was far more than I expected. Thought I was only going to get a few sliding frames ala some anime segments but instead got a lot of animation for each panel of the graphic novel. In fact, this segment alone sold me on getting the whole graphic novel animated DVD. Likewise, you also get a behind-the-scenes featurette on the back stories that are Tales of the Black Freighter and Under the Hood and what they mean to the overall Watchmen experience.

The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is solely because five stars means I've been blown away and, well, the Watchmen theatrical film already did that and this isn't quite as good. It's my hope, however, that on the Watchmen director's cut they splice in Tales of the Black Freighter as shown above. Very cool. They shot all the newsstand scenes with the kid reading the comic book for it anyway so might as well use them.

This is not necessarily a Watchmen story.
It's the comic that the boy was reading at the newstand. In a world that HAS heroes, what do people read? Pirate stories.
I knew he was reading the comic and what it was about but this is basically the whole story instead of the little clips he talks about in the Watchmen book/movie. Although that is not a bad thing, it is not a hero story like you might expect. There are connections between the actual Watchmen characters but they are so vague, the average reader won't know unless you watch the behind the scenes in which the tell you about it.
The DVD has additional footage of Hollis (the original Owl) and his book that he wrote (as discussed in the original animated story where he upset a lot of current heroes). What if heroes are real, one retires and writes a book? That is what the additional footage is all about. It's not animated. it's with the real actors from the motion picture. Which to me, should be an extra from the actual movie and has no place on the Black Freighter DVD. Must be filler to justify a blu-ray DVD.

Included is the animated version of Tales from the Black Freighter, Hollis Mason (Nite Owl I)'s biography ""Under the Hood"" and Silk Spectre's newspaper's interview filmed as a TV documentary, a behind the scenes feature, and the first chapter of  the Watchmen ""moving book"".

First, the animated mini-feature.  Plot is preposterous, of course, but animated exactly the way it's written--bloated corpse-raft and all.  The animation is a little clumsy, but passable.

The ""Under the Hood"" documentary is an entertaining and fascinating piece of work, complete with ridiculous commercials from the 80s.  Through facsimile newspaper documents and ""vintage"" film clips, it establishes the verisimilar look and feel of the newspaper clippings and backpage features from the graphic novel as it establishes the history of costumed adventuring in the Watchmen world.

The ""moving"" Watchmen graphic novel is basically one chapter of the original Watchmen graphic novel crudely animated, panel for panel.  The animation is great, and you get an awesome feel for how truly cinematic the source material was.  The biggest drawback (and I mean HUGE) is the voice work.  ALL the voices, from Rorschach's growl to Silk Spectre's female voice, are done by a single male actor, with slow, stilted delivery.  It's awful.  If they couldn't have gotten the actors from the movie, at least get a couple actors of different genders to play out the characters instead of ruining a perfectly clever piece of animation.

The feature tale is 25 minutes long, looks cool, and has all the brutality of the comic and maybe even more.  But God, do I hate me some roaring sharks.  Filmmakers, take heed: SHARKS DO NOT ROAR!  That aside, the film is good and would have made an amazing bonus feature on the double-disc DVD release of ""Watchmen"", but packaged by itself, it just isn't enough. Even when thrown together with a 37 minute live-action interview featuring cast members from the film discussing the original Nite Owl's tell-all autobiography ""Under The Hood"" it's not enough.  The contents of ""Under The Hood"" is mostly just a reiteration of things from the graphic novel and even some redundancy from the film.  Again, an outstanding bonus feature, but not worth a lot by itself.  It's nice to get more Carla Gugino without that awful aging makeup, though.  Also featured is a half-hour documentary about the projects, and a 10 minute preview of the promising ""Green Lantern"" animated feature.  All good, but one more time: it all amounts to nothing more than a disc of bonus features that should have been saved for the ""Watchmen"" DVD release.

If you are a complete rabid maniac over anything ""Watchmen""-related then by all means, pick this up.  But know what you are getting.

Finally, ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" arrives!

I've been excited to see this animated feature every since I read ""Watchmen"". I'm glad Zach Snyder followed through with the idea to make it.

I enjoyed the animated ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" narrated by Gerard Butler, the story stayed true to it's original form in ""Watchmen"", with a few minor changes. The animated feature only lasts about 25 minutes unfortunately.

Also on the disc is the feature, ""Under the Hood"". It is around 30 minutes long and not to exciting, but essential to the overall story, as was in the graphic novel, but only briefly mentioned in the movie.

This dvd also has several interviews with the producers, directors and a few of the actors from the film.

""Tales of the Black Freighter"" is a must see if you've read ""Watchmen"", and still definitely worth watching if you haven't.

""Under the Hood"" is good, not great and would probably be confusing & a little boring to anyone that hasn't seen the movie or read ""Watchmen""!

A young black man visits a newspaper stand everyday and reads comic books without paying for them. A pirate story bled through the pages and introduced the reader to a man who had lost his entire crew thanks to the attack of the Black Freighter. He decides to head home in hopes of warning the people before the Black Freighter makes it to his town. After making his way back to shore, he uses the corpses of his crew to make a raft and sets out to sea. He winds up going mad in the process as the Freighter impairs his judgement of what's truly fantasy and what is actually reality.

The storyline was almost identical with the source material in this animated feature. The only issue I had was the character design. Everything else looked fantastic and was animated beautifully. The sky was incredibly vibrant the entire time and the sea looked almost lifelike at times. The characters were animated rather poorly, in my opinion though. It may just be the design, but their quality looked poor and their animation wasn't up to par in comparison to everything else around them. Reminded me a bit of the character designs in Aeon Flux. All in all, it's well worth seeing. But it's rather short as it only clocks in at around twenty one minutes without the credits.

Under the Hood is the autobiography of Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl. It's basically his version of the events that transpired during the time he was a superhero and was a part of the Minutemen. There's a feature devoted solely to this autobiography on the Black Freighter DVD.

The feature is basically a live-action documentary of Hollis Mason/Nite Owl being interviewed about Under the Hood and everything he included in his book. It also focuses heavily on the Minutemen, the original team of superheroes from the thirties. Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre and Edward Jacobi/Moloch are also in it quite a bit. There's even a brief cameo from The Comedian. It's really just a companion piece to the film that sheds a bit more light on characters that were only briefly touched on in the actual Watchmen film. A must see for anyone who was a fan of the film.

3770406,1,B001QTWC0K,"I have no idea where the idea of a naked blue man, followed by loads of extended sex fit into a super hero movie.  This was the worst example of film I've ever seen.  I really wish I hadn't witnessed any of this movie.  It makes me sad to see that people stoop this low to get attention.  The story is O.K. , but why there's so much nudity makes no sense to me.  I do not recommend anyone watch this movie.  Stick with The Dark Night.",1237593600,3,434,3.9310344827586206
