7039052,5,B00UGQ3JQU,"1942 the Nazi occupation of France. Refugees must take a long and torturers rout Through Casa Blanca on their way to America; there ""Everybody comes to Rick's."" Rick's is a nightclub and a way station for a chance to get to America. Rick is played by Humphrey Bogart.

Here we also stay for a while to watch a drama unfold. There are overlapping stories. One of a young couple trying to get to America and the girl wondering if a girl should have to do something naughty was wondering what would happen if her husband, ""a boy in many ways"", would find out? A second rate crook (Peter Lorre) obtains something of value at the expense of two German curriers. A Police Captain (Claude Rains) is shocked to find there is gambling going on at Rick's as he stuffs his pocket with his gambling earnings. Many other stories surround the main theme of a love triangle that started in Paris and now can mean so much to individuals or the effort for freedom.

Will the Nazi's win their prize?
Will Capt. Renault get the young girl?
Will Rick get away with Ilsa?

This film has become quite a classic. There are many quotes and misquotes attributed to the film. You will find your self kibitzing. One memorable seen for all is the showdown where the Germans are singing ""Watch on the Rhine"" and Yvonne (Madeleine LeBeau) over powers them and herself with tears in her eyes singing the ""La Marseillaise.""",1495670400,5,1391,4.556

The story is set in Casablanca after the fall of France. Refugees crowd the city, waiting to flee abroad. Rick, an American expatriate, runs a caf (with gambling in a backroom). This operation is protected by the local Chief of Police. The first funny scene is where Victor Laszlo, wanted by the Gestapo, appears under his own name! Then he is introduced to the Nazi chief! All so polite (can you believe it?) Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head. How did he not just escape, but wind up with a caf? I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high-grade informer. Its not an accident that Yugartes is arrested after he shows up at Rick's and confesses. Rick has knocked around way too much to be so sentimental in Paris. The question is whether the Laszlos will be able to escape to Lisbon, and then to America, with the transit papers. Those German soldiers sing Wacht am Rhein, a 19th century nationalist song. Watch on the Rhine was a stage play and a later film.

Conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil. Rick shows sentimentality with the Bulgarian couple; was this just a whim or some sort of pay-off to explain a large sum of money? Victor Laszlo escapes from an underground meeting. Wouldn't he be under constant surveillance? There is a surprise ending. Rick double-crosses Louis to let Victor and Ilse leave. The foggy night creates atmosphere (is fog possible in the desert?). Major Strosser arrives, but somehow lacks his usual retinue and pays dearly for his mistake. [Believable? It echoes the fate of Heydrich.] The real scandal is not that Rick and Louis run off together to join the Free French. It is that nobody escaped from the concentration camps of the Gestapo unless they were turned into double agents. This suggests Victor is now a Nazi agent (read some of the post WW 2 books)! The efficient British counter-intelligence would soon deal with him. Or could Rick really be a triple agent, who uses Louis' affection to escape to Allied territory after effecting the escape of Victor and Ilse?

The charm of this film seems to be its classic restraint and understatement with its stilted language. It has unity of time, place, and action. The film is fast-paced and tightly edited. The Hollywood Production Code supported the happy ending where Victor and Ilses marriage continued after their hardships. The cleverness of this film is how it layers sentimentality over a rude reality, like some old-fashioned fairy tale that has different meanings for children and for adults I think the happiness of the performers shows in their stage presence. Many were refugees from Nazi Europe. This makes it a better film than Citizen Kane and its cynical performers. One flaw is the story of exit visas which cannot be canceled; no government would do that. Force majeure trumps a piece of paper.

The book Round Up the Usual Suspects tells about the making of this film, whose story transcended the usual money-making entertainment. The popularity of this film was followed by a series on radio, as with other films (Sam Spade). That is where Play it again, Sam may have originated. There was also a popular novelty tune inspired by this film..",1518220800,2,3266,4.7752212389380535
