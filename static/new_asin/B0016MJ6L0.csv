3159443,5,B0016MJ6L0,"We purchased yet another Veggietales video and once again we were not disappointed. In this adventure Tom and Huck teach everyone that sometimes we have to put others ahead of our own ambitions. I always find myself watching the videos just as hard as my son. He absolutely loves this movie and so do I. A parent cannot possibly go wrong teaching this important lesson to their child. By taking care of others, we take care of ourselves. And I think Huck is on to something with Jerky Land. See if you don't agree.",1224288000,8,514,4.4787234042553195
3159444,5,B0016MJ6L0,"This arrived (like all of the other Veggie Tale DVDs) in perfect condition, and my granddaughter is getting hours of enjoyment out of it.",1221782400,,137,4.75
3159445,5,B0016MJ6L0,"For those that don't know, The VeggieTales series features animated vegetables that teach children history and values while telling an entertaining story. Bible verses area a key part of that mission, but, the teaching is done in a gentle way and does not heavily push a religious agenda. The latest installment works on the idea of helping others.

After a very funny preview of ""The Pirates Who Won't Do Anything,"" the video opens with the vegetables meeting in book club fashion. Instead of reading the book, they all have been using ""Norm's Notes"" which gives a condensed version of classic books along with some criticism of the book for vegetables on the go. While some of this may skip over the kid audience, adults will certainly get a few chuckles out of this as well as the numerous pop culture references throughout the video.

Bob the Tomato soon reads a question from a child who knows another child who is being picked on. The child wants to help, but is scared if he does, will get picked on too. An issue that any parent or teacher will have to deal with regarding the kids in their lives. After a brief discussion on the topic which hasn't really settled the issue, the video segues into the story ""Tomato Sawyer & Huckleberry Larry's Big River Rescue.""

Narrated by Clark Wayne, the story tells about life along the big river aka"" The Mighty Mississippi"" and focuses on Big Jim who is working at Dooley and Sons Lumber Camp as punishment for a crime he did not commit. Through song, conversation and narration, history in the form of the Homesteading Act, Federal Tax Laws and other facts are told as well as a very good story.

Big Jim manages to escape the Lumber Camp and eventually winds up with Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry. He wants to be reunited with his Mama. Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry figure out that he used to have a singing career with his Mama and was very famous. They soon figure out that Dooley and Sons aren't telling the truth, that Big Jim is, and that he needs help.

Help in getting away from the evil clutches of Dooley and Sons. Help in getting to St. Louis to reunite with his mom. Help that Tomato Bob is willing to give up to a point. When it comes down to it, while Huckleberry Larry realizes that not helping someone is the same as hurting someone, Tomato Sawyer is a bit slower to grasp the concept. Once he does, he arrives in the nick of time to help Huckleberry Larry and Big Jim and participate in the feel good conclusion of the story.

Justice is served, Big Jim is reunited with mom and Clark Wayne puts the final touches on a well done tale before viewers are returned to the book club. The overall theme is reinforced by a bible verse and a discussion between Tomato and Pickle about what it all means. They refer to the child's letter and suggest various ways to help the child being picked on.

The video runs about 50 minutes and doesn't suffer from blaring music and unhearable dialog as so many do these days. Bonus items include a ""Behind the Scenes"" feature (writing a Biscuit silly song, studio commentary, among others), ""Fun and Games"" (songs, a puzzle game, more on how to draw), ""Parents"" feature (details on the computer CD-ROM items) and a ""discussion guide.""  The bonus items are concluded with the ""Studio Store"" feature with references to many more items available at BigIdea.com.

The Veggie Tales have always been a big hit around here and this latest installment is another one. It isn't preachy and serves to gently guide and teach while telling a great story.  It will tickle the funny bone of children and adults alike with a gentle story and plenty of pop culture references while reinforcing a great message.

3159448,3,B0016MJ6L0,"This movie isn't half as clever as ""The Wizard of Has,"" which was what we were hoping it would be like.  The message is good but more complex than a lot of their messages, so it might go over the heads of the youngest viewers.",1216684800,5,226,4.022222222222222
3159449,5,B0016MJ6L0,"I love these guys at big Idea.  Biblical but not preachy, and it looks like a lot of work went into it.  Too much Christian brand stuff is sooo preachy and sooo far below the bar for what the story and visual standards are for kids entertainment these days.  These guys do good work, and all the extras on the dvd... I have never seen so much original extra stuff on one dvd...not even pixar films... the big guys could take a dvd lesson from these guys. (Thogh pixar films sure are pretty)

My advice, buy it if you love veggie tales, and this is a good first buy if have never seen one before.

good show, i was entertained AND NOT BORED.  Thats important to me.",1216425600,2,664,4.188976377952756
3159450,5,B0016MJ6L0,"This entry in the VeggieTales series features one story.  Inspired by the works of Mark Twain (sort of), we get the see why helping others is truly important.

Clark Wayne (George the Postman from Toy that Saved Christmas) narrates the story, which begins at Doodle's Lumber Yard when Big Jim (Apollo Gourd) escapes.  While the other employees are paid, Jim has been paying off his debt to society after his conviction of stealing Turkey Jerky.  A conviction he still flatly denies.

Meanwhile, Tomato Sawyer (Bob the Tomato) and Huckleberry Larry (Larry the Cucumber) are just days away from earning the land they've been homesteading from the government.  Huck wants to open an amusement park dedicated to Turkey Jerky, while Tom plans to open the first tax preparer service in the region.  And he's not letting the fact that this is 1904, 9 years before income tax started, get in his way.

But when Big Jim's path crosses theirs, trouble ensues.  Huck knows they need to help, but Tom is reluctant.  Will they do the right thing?  And if so can they still earn their land?

Meanwhile, there is the brand new silly song, featuring Archibald Asparagus as he leads a road trip to ""The Biscuit of Zazzamarandabo.""  And anyone who has ever been on a road trip will love it.

Frankly, anyone will love this entire DVD.  The story is fast moving with plenty of gags for the kids, but there are so many jokes that only the adults will get as well.  I was laughing quite a bit all the way through.  The lesson about helping others is strong without being preachy.  And they've even got some get jabs at Cliff's Notes.

This is another winner from the guys at Big Idea.  The entire family will love it.",1216080000,18,1696,4.608695652173913

3159543,4,B0016MJ6L0,"Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry is a funny new twist on Mark Twain's classic works. Bob and Larry (Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry) are only days away from owning their own land next to the Mississippi river, when they find themselves needed to help an innocent gourd find his way home. Tomato Sawyer struggles with the idea that they might have to give up their own land for a gourd they just met, but Huckleberry Larry knows that not helping someone is the same thing as hurting them. Not surprisingly, the moral of the story is to help someone when they need help. This amusing show has simple and clever jokes in it, which makes it great for little ones and their older siblings! The Biscuit of Zazzamarandabo is a hilarious new silly song that is as fun to pronounce as it is to sing. Having grown up with the classic Veggietales videos, I do wish they would return to their old ways of incorporating bible stories, but they still have wonderful morals and happy veggies that will influence children for the better.",1354752000,,1028,4.622950819672131
3159544,3,B0016MJ6L0,"My kids love VeggieTales and this one is an okay story line, but it is not a ""go to"" episode that is frequently picked out by the kids.  Would recommend ""Gideon Tuba Warrior"" instead.",1327449600,,183,4.382352941176471

3159547,2,B0016MJ6L0,"Maybe a 3yo will find this interesting but, this is the most boring Veggie Tales movie I have ever seen. The story was boring; the silly song was boring. I smiled a few times and laughed only once.

The story is kind of dumb. Almost terrible. It butchers _Huckleberry Finn_ without any anything funny or endearing by which to redeem the spoofing.

I used to like Veggie Tales, but for the most part the older VT stories are fine and the newer ones are poor (I haven't seen all of the latest, though). Skip this one.",1257984000,,515,4.354166666666667

3394040,4,B0016MJ6L0,"Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry is a funny new twist on Mark Twain's classic works. Bob and Larry (Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry) are only days away from owning their own land next to the Mississippi river, when they find themselves needed to help an innocent gourd find his way home. Tomato Sawyer struggles with the idea that they might have to give up their own land for a gourd they just met, but Huckleberry Larry knows that not helping someone is the same thing as hurting them. Not surprisingly, the moral of the story is to help someone when they need help. This amusing show has simple and clever jokes in it, which makes it great for little ones and their older siblings! The Biscuit of Zazzamarandabo is a hilarious new silly song that is as fun to pronounce as it is to sing. Having grown up with the classic Veggietales videos, I do wish they would return to their old ways of incorporating bible stories, but they still have wonderful morals and happy veggies that will influence children for the better.",1354752000,,1028,4.622950819672131
3394041,3,B0016MJ6L0,"My kids love VeggieTales and this one is an okay story line, but it is not a ""go to"" episode that is frequently picked out by the kids.  Would recommend ""Gideon Tuba Warrior"" instead.",1327449600,,183,4.382352941176471

3394044,2,B0016MJ6L0,"Maybe a 3yo will find this interesting but, this is the most boring Veggie Tales movie I have ever seen. The story was boring; the silly song was boring. I smiled a few times and laughed only once.

The story is kind of dumb. Almost terrible. It butchers _Huckleberry Finn_ without any anything funny or endearing by which to redeem the spoofing.

I used to like Veggie Tales, but for the most part the older VT stories are fine and the newer ones are poor (I haven't seen all of the latest, though). Skip this one.",1257984000,,515,4.354166666666667
