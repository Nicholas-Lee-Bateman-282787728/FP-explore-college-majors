7972936,3,B00006SFJ0,"PLOT: Mystic/Magician Chandu tries to keep an Egyptian Princess from being a human sacrifice.

Frank Chandler aka Chandu arrives on a plane and two thugs are at the airport to stop him. He uses the Mysical Powers of his ring ""disappears"" from a phone booth and arrives at his home to stop an attempted kidnap. This is as good as it gets. Chandu spends 12 chapters saving the love interest the LOVELY Maria Alba /Narji an Egyptian princess from being kidnapped and used for a human sacrifice. Bela Lugosi is very good as the mystic who saves the girl. But the plot is way too slow. It lags and drags. The Invisibility part is fun and effective. But it is not used often enough to save the series. Chandu is also able at times....again....not enough to make a big difference to mind control the ""baddies"" to talk or save himself. I give it a 3 STARS for an interesting look mystic powers of Bela /Chandu...where did they get the name Chandu??....Chandler.....was his real name. Black and White...this edition is divided in TWO DVDS....series one.....Chapter 1-6 and series two...Chatpers 7-12. 3 STARS~",1475193600,,1100,4.7591623036649215
7972937,2,B00006SFJ0,"I am a life-long fan of Bela Lugosi, and I rejoice in the fact that he got to play the hero in this serial. It didn't happen often. But I can't give this any more than two stars, for several reasons. First, the quality of the print is absolutely dreadful: it's washed out; the soundtrack is noisy; there are splices. Surely there must be a print somewhere that, if not pristine, is at least in better condition than the one they used here. Second, the heroine, Maria Alba, is a pathetic actress. Perhaps in her native Spain she was good, but her English is borderline unintelligible. She sounds like a Spanish or Puerto Rican exchange student in her first high school play. The story is stretched to the breaking point. The final couple of chapters almost say, ""We should have ended this halfway through, but we were contracted to churn out 12 chapters, so here goes..."" It's a pity, really, because, as I said, Bela didn't get to play a hero very often. In this one, he tries real hard, but he's pretty ineffectual from time to time, as per the script. Too bad!",1404864000,3,1062,4.479381443298969
7972938,5,B00006SFJ0,"This is a series of shorts that appeared in theaters across the United States. The plots focus on good trumps evil; the music supreme. Bela Lugosi is convincing and brilliant in his role. The films are not without scratches, skips, and other flaws, but if you look beyond their imperfections you will enjoy them anyway.",1401840000,2,319,4.818181818181818
7972939,5,B00006SFJ0,"This is the 1934 SERIAL (shown in its entirety, 12 chapters), broken down into two parts, available on two separate DVDs:

This Lugosi serial was later edited (cut) into this 1935 film:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chandu-on-the-Magic-Island-Feature/dp/B0007OP1EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chandu on the Magic Island:Feature</a>

The SERIAL version is terrific (the movie is pretty good too but I prefer viewing the uncut version of the film) with Lugosi playing Frank Chandler, aka Chandu the Magician, as he battles on with the evil High Priest Vindhyan on the South Seas Island of Lemuria.

It is on this island where Chandu's fianc&eacute;e, the Egyptian Princess Nadji (played by the lovely Maria Alba) is being held captive until Chandu can rescue her. You'll love seeing the special effects as Chandu ""vanishes"" into thin air -- it really freaks out his adversaries too!

The film is, of course, shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. The total running time for both DVDs is 3 hours and 32 minutes (212 minutes). (The running time for the 1935 feature film, ""Chandu on the magic Island,"" is only 65 minutes!)

For a full Saturday afternoon of old theater serial nostalgia, grab this one ASAP! Tons of fun -- my highest recommendation!",1215907200,10,1696,6.608108108108108
