2378985,1,B000A7PKGW,"I don't love Raymond, I think this show sucks. He's like Seinfeld, a comedian with minimal talant who surrounds himself with a decent cast.",1126051200,4,139,4.833333333333333
2378986,5,B000A7PKGW,"Well now were do i start, this is my first online review for anything and im glad that its for Everybody loves Raymond. I first seen Everybody loves Raymond about a year ago on Irish national television i was unawear of how long it had been running for and unawear of how long it had been shown on Irish television but after that first twenty minutes or so of pure comic Genius i too loved Raymond. I was really annoyed at first to find that like when the show was originally aired in the states it had not beened given the what seems to be universal prime time monday night comedy slot, where in the states it was on on a friday night it was on over this side of the water during the day time when most people where in work really killing its chances of having any fans or getting any real media attention. But thank Heavens for the DVD, i recently bought both series one and two (as there the only ones available over here at the moment)and i wet myself with laughter for three days non-stop its the only time i ever went out of my to watch anything in me life, each season has 25 episodes and i watch the whole fifty in three days(In between work and sleep of course)i have read a lot of the other reviews and most of them are just summaries of each episode which i'm not going to do, if you read this and it in any way helps your decision to purchase then you will want to watch each episode as a VIRGIN if you will to easily one of the best if not the best American sitcom ever produced, I could very easily waffle on until season nine is released on dvd about how great it is but don't take my word for it its best if you see for yourself. There are many things that make Raymond a great sitcom like the top notch excellent casting or the brilliant writing but i think the main reason for me is and altough i'm only 23 at the moment and have not been through as much as these charactors have all the situations are believeable and most are what i will have to look forward to in the future, i see a little bit of raymond in me and his family and friends in my family and friends and i think this is truly what makes raymond genuinly funny and that its all about the ups and downs of being close or not so close to your nearest and dearest YOUR FAMILY. I recommend EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and am 100% positive that EVERBODY who watches will LOVE RAYMOND.",1125360000,10,2359,4.130434782608695

However, the plastic framing which houses the various discs was shattered--the first time we opened the package, we encountered a shower of orangish, translucent  plastic shards--the framing of the disc holder.  I didn't return the package because I had purchased it for my wife's birthday and we didn't open the package for a couple of weeks after delivery.

2379145,5,B000A7PKGW,"This is the 1st modern day sitcom that I have ever following faithfully.  There are several reasons for this:
1.  As you can see these are not 16 year old's jumping in and out of bed, but mature actors & actress who display real raw talent, which I have not seen since, the D. Van D Show.  Keep in mind, because I was too young to ever have watched that 1960 show but that very delicate and humor as there, I see the same in this show.  In other words, making simple every day life moments, which we can all relate to funny.

2.  There was no one stand out character on this show.  Every single character fully contributed to what made that show.

3.  Lastly, I am the Debra character, my husband, David is the Raymond Character, and Mother in Law, is the Marie Character.  This is my life.....O, yes, I can't make this stuff up",1401840000,,828,4.2165605095541405

The Can Opener episode views an argument between Ray and Debra from their perspectives as told to others - this was an eye opener to me as I recalled my arguments with my spouse and how I portrayed the events afterwards. So many funny bits in other episodes, such as Ray's reaction to Robert doing his job during a robbery at Nemo's, or the men in family with their reaction to Debra's friend who gets some ""work"" done or the on-going struggle between Debra and Marie.

2379254,5,B000A7PKGW,"This is a good solid season.  It is not as consistently funny as season 5 will be but there are several highlights.  The big event in this season was when Robert is gored by a bull.  Robert's recovery will be a factor in several episodes.  One of the funniest ELR eps ever is ""Bad Moon Rising"" where Debra totally goes off!  She really did need help. Another good Debra blow-up show is ""The Tenth Anniversary"" where she finds out Ray taped over their wedding video.  ""Left Back"" and ""The Christmas Picture"" are two more of my favorites.  Extras are deleted scenes on disc 5 (I like it better when outtakes of episodes are on the same DVD as the episodes but whatever) and commentaries on ""B**b Job,"" ""Robert's Rodeo,"" ""The Tenth anniversary,"" and ""Bad Moon Rising.""

Disc 1:

""B**b Job""--Debra uses some clever deception to prove that Raymond is obsessed with the size of women's breasts.

""The Can Opener""--Raymond and Debra tell different stories about their argument over a new can opener.

""You Bet""--Raymond finds it odd that Frank wants to spend more time with him until he finds out he's only fishing for inside scoops on sporting events for betting purposes.

""Sex Talk""--Debra thinks her and Ray's love life is getting to be like Frank and Marie's.

""The Will""--Raymond and Debra are making out their wills and create a family ruckus when they choose friends Bernie and Linda as the guardians of their children.

Disc 2:

""The Sister""--Debra is skeptical when her wild sister says she's becoming a nun.

""Cousin Gerard""--Marie gets Raymond to hire his annoying cousin to help him on his book and he begins to think he sounds and looks just as annoyingly.  They found the perfect actor to play Gerard.

""Debra's Workouts""--Debra is in the mood more often and Ray thinks it's due to her hot aerobics instructor.

""No Thanks""--Debra tries to use a positive attitude with Marie and it backfires.  This is a frustrating episode where you just want to reach into the TV and strangle people.

""Left Back""--Michael may need to stay in preschool another year.  Those kids always seemed less than bright but they did a terrific job showing one being way less bright than the other.  I like when the teacher shows their different artworks and Frank's opinion on the twins. One of my favorites of this season.

Disc 3:

""The Christmas Picture""--Marie wants a family portrait for Christmas but gets all huffy when Debra invites her parents.  Another favorite of mine.

""What's With Robert?""--After his third breakup with Amy, thoughts circulate that Robert might be gay.

""Bully on the Bus""--Ray finds out Ally is being bullied but, after taking a ride on the school bus, he learns that's not the whole story.

""Prodigal Son""--Raymond is guilt-tripped into going to mass.

""Robert's Rodeo""--After Raymond cancels their Saturday of watching the game and eating meatlover's pizza, Robert takes an extra shift at the police department and, in attempting to shut down an illegal rodeo, is gored by a bull in the, uh, upper thigh.

Disc 4:

""The Tenth Anniversary""--Raymond and Debra watch their wedding video and--surprise--something else comes on.  Very funny.

""Hackidu""--Raymond interferes in Ally's card trading while trying to compete with a show-off super dad.  Robert has an interesting theory on why Ray's kids are blonde--I often wondered about that.

""Debra Makes Something Good""--Debra is finally successful in the kitchen making braciole so good that it gets Frank's attention and Marie's jealousy.

""Marie and Frank's New Friends""--Deb and Ray encourage Frank and Marie to make friends so they can have a social life outside the family (mainly for the benefit of Deb and Ray, of course). Their new friends (the couple who took Robert in for one episode the previous season) turn out to be big Ray Barone fans.

""Alone Time""--Ray sees Debra crying and thinks she is unhappy in their marriage.

Disc 5:

""Someone's Cranky""--After finding out he has to stay at his parent's house for another 3 weeks, Robert begins acting like a jerk to everybody.  Debra gets to the bottom (uh, upper thigh) of it.

""Bad Moon Rising""--Debra is ""not feeling well via hormonally"" and doesn't seem to appreciate Raymond buying her mood pills and recording her outbursts.  Debra totally goes off!  This one is so funny it brought tears to my eyes.

""Confronting the Attacker""--Robert freezes on his first day back on the force and quits.  Ray takes him to confront his attacker at the, uh, petting zoo.

""Robert's Divorce""--After seeing Robert's infamous ex-wife while out to dinner with Amy, the Barone family goes down memory lane with a flashback of Robert's unhappy marriage.",1182643200,,4661,4.93951093951094
2379255,5,B000A7PKGW,"This fourth season has some classic RAYMOND, at its best.  Where do I begin without giving away too much?  Hmmm....well, I will say this, this motley crew packs a punch, in these episodes.  I particularly enjoy the tenth anniversary episode where Debra finds [to her horror] that Ray taped over their wedding video with the Super Bowl [the bane of her existence, but now for a special reason].  There are a lot of episodes in season four that showcase Ray's insensitive and inept behavior and Debra's struggle to take it in stride, when she'd really like to smother him in his sleep with a pillow.  [Well, maybe I am speaking more for myself than for Debra, but that can't be too far from the truth.]  What's more, we get more laughs from his unpredictable brother (Brad Garrett), mother (Doris Roberts), and father (Peter Boyle).

2379262,5,B000A7PKGW,"I'm really glad for the release of these DVD box sets, because without them, I never would have gotten into this show...now one of my very favorites!

The plot centers upon Ray Barone, a sportswriter living on Long Island with his wife Debra and children Ally, Geoffrey and Michael. The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...

This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.

Season 4 includes a family Christmas photo that proves impossible to take; more squabbles between Ray and Debra about their sex life; and a serious job-related injury for Robert.

If you're unfamiliar with this show, check it out! You'll soon be laughing hysterically and looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164931200,,1286,4.939814814814815
2379263,5,B000A7PKGW,"Great season again.  Just wondering, is it just me or was this the first season that used widescreen?  It isn't fullscreen on my TV anymore, which isn't a bad thing, just something I noticed.  They've done it widescreen ever since right?  The first 3 seasons are full screen I think right?",1158883200,2,289,4.607843137254902
2379264,5,B000A7PKGW,"This may be the best season of the series simply because it's the most consistent, with very few filler episodes and even those have some redeeming quality.

It starts off with ""Boob Job"" with the message that boob jobs really aren't the answer. It seems kind of hypocrytical given all the plastic surgery Patrica Heaton's had, but it's still one of the shows best season premires. ""Sex Talk"" has some memorable lines as does ""Debra's Workout"" and ""The Can Opener"", and of course the brillant ""Bad Moon Rising"", where Patrica Heaton gives one of the shows most memorable performances.

The only bad episodes to speak of here are the preachy ""Prodigal Son"", ""Hackidu"", and ""Bully on The Bus"". If you're only going to buy one season of the series, make it this one.",1147737600,9,763,4.7293233082706765

2379267,5,B000A7PKGW,"Raymond is excellent and funny! The other thing is it that it is so true to life. Raymond and Debra hate each other and fight a lot and have to stay together for their children. Hilarious!

Also really funny is Ray's father. He sits around the house in just his underwear berating his wife. Both father and son have marriages where they constantly argue. Funny as!

A friend of mine said they thought that Ray must be really funny as a stand-up comedian, and they couldn't be more right, I believe. Also Ray is so sexy and his voice is beautiful.

This show also shows us how people get married and lose their will to live.

Brilliant!",1141344000,3,635,4.401709401709402
2379268,1,B000A7PKGW,"At any given time, there are at least three channels showing ""Raymond"" reruns in all their tedious screeching glory.  TP Barnum was right- I'm always amazed at the kind of horrible pablum the American public seems to thrive on.  Sure the occasional good show sneaks through and even, briefly, thrives eg Seinfeld, but this... its just bad.  Not ""so bad its good bad"", not ""wow that's an interesting train wreck"" bad...not even the ""wow, they're finding new ways to suck"" bad.  Just gratingly, stupifyingly, bland bland bland bad.  The deeply ashamed, I just completely wasted a half-hour of my time and now I want it back bad.  The I'm so ashamed to even have my tv on now bad.  The please, for the love of god, when is a commercial going to come on to grant me a brief reprieve from this bad.

Let me tell you a story to illustrate exactly how bad it is.  I had a girlfriend in highschool who's dad liked to watch ""Hee Haw""- if you've never seen Hee Haw before, its the kind of show- not unlike the Lawrence Welk show- that is so bad that it actually makes you physically ill to watch- cold sweats, nausea, vertigo- the whole 9- anyway, part of the penance I had to do to date his daughter was to sit with the fam and watch a half hour to hour of Hee Haw every time I went over-  worse, I had to pretend like I enjoyed it.

Every time my wife turns on ""Raymond"", I long wistfully for the good ole days of Hee Haw.",1135209600,6,1414,4.2388059701492535

2379270,4,B000A7PKGW,"This set was hilarious. especially the ""sex talk"" episode. I had watched this a few nights prior to buying this set and laughed so hard I was crying, and was so pleasantly surprised to see it on this season...it is not a waste of money, but I do believe moviemakers should rethink the widescreen thing for an at home movie/tv show set. I see that season 5 is in widescreen too....  Boo hoo.",1129161600,2,390,4.342465753424658

I specially love the episodes ""Sex Talks ""which illustrates another version of ""Sex and the City "" topic within common family !The comic expression of Debra and Marie did earn them the best actress nominees without any doubt....I am so glad that the sitcom DVDs finally come out and glad to see its another glorious day on Emmy 2005 !",1127174400,2,860,4.8175675675675675
2379272,5,B000A7PKGW,"I really didn't start watching Raymond on a regualr basis until several years into the run so I've been relying on the frequent re-runs to see the episodes I never saw in first run.  That's what makes the DVD full seasons so great.  The 4th season had a number of my favorite episodes and a few bonafide classics.

""Sex Talk""  Ray and Debra are upset because their sex life isn't what it used to be in terms of frequency.  But they become really discouraged when they find out how often Frank and Marie are having sex.

""Cousin Gerard"" Fred Stoller brilliantly plays whiny cousin Gerard who at first annoys Ray, and then scares him when is family points out how much the two are alike with their nasally voices.

""The Christmas Picture"" - Ray just wants to take a nice family portrait for Christmas but ends up fighting with the whole family and trying to please Marie when she doesn't want Debra's parents in the picture.

""What's With Robert?"" When Robert keeps putting off Amy on the subject of Marriage Ray begins to wonder if Robert may be gay.

""Tenth Anniversay""  Debra sits down to watch her and Ray's wedding video only to find out that Ray has carelessly taped a football game over it.

""Debra makes Something Good""  A Classic!  Debra makes a dish that Ray, Robert, and Frank all go crazy over.  And Marie is not happy about it at all!

""Bad Moon Rising""  Ray tries to help Debra Out with her PMS problem but only makes things worse when he thinks the pills he bought her will take care of everything.

""Hackidu""  A spoof of the Pokemon craze of a few years ago as Ray turns into a nutcase trying to get Ally's favorite card back.

Great show and this was a very solid season from beginning to end.",1126742400,6,1708,4.416666666666667

2379274,5,B000A7PKGW,"The 1999/2000 season of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" was the breakthrough year for the acclaimed series. It's not that previous seasons of the show didn't have some great episodes(""Good Girls"" from Season Two, or Season Three's ""How They Met"", for example), but Season Four delivers a number of truly classic episodes which helped the show to consistently beat the once mighty ""Monday Night Football"" in the ratings. It also drew attention to the talented cast- Patricia Heaton won the first of her two Emmys for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series thanks to her work in Season Four. She's a standout in ""Bad Moon Rising"", where her character, Debra Barone, undergoes some heavy-duty PMS related mood swings, much to the dismay of Raymond. Other superb episodes include ""The Can Opener"", in which Ray and Debra's versions of a fight over a can opener are vastly different; and ""Sex Talk"", when Ray and Debra discover that Frank and Marie, Ray's senior citizen-age parents, are more active in the bedroom than they are. I look forward to subsequent seasons of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" on DVD, because the show was able to maintain a high level of consistency over its' nine year run, especially from Season Four on. Consider the Season Four DVD the set you must have if you are choosing from the early years of this wonderful series.",1126569600,8,1331,4.86784140969163
