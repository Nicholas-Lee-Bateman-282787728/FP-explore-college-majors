8155203,5,B000K9KTAC,Very good. Sarah Naylor is a fantastic teacher. The tunes are all traditional Scottish and progress from easy to learn to difficult.,1373587200,,132,5.045454545454546
8155204,5,B000K9KTAC,Sarah Naylor's approach to teaching the Scottish fiddle is extremely easy to follow. She approached each tune in segments that are easy to follow. I highly recommend  This DVD as well as her Scottish fiddle for beginners.,1368057600,,221,4.972972972972973
8155205,5,B000K9KTAC,"I had heard/seen Sarah play a number of tunes on YouTube, so I had no hesitation in ordering this lesson. Having viewed it, my only reservation (and it's not a big one) is Sarah's refusal to look directly at the camera.  She looks a bit off to the side as though she is reading a prepared statement.  Maybe she is, or maybe she's shy.  That aside, she demonstrates each tune clearly and slowly enough for the viewer to follow her.  For the musically literate, the booklet enclosed has the scores.  The tunes are well chosen, all of them fresh and unhackneyed. The first one, ""Mrs. MacLeod"", is the only one commonly known to American fiddlers (""Hop up my Ladies"" or ""Uncle Joe"") but is done in the Scots style.  Not for the raw beginner, although I understand she has put out a DVD for newbies.  One hopes she will follow this effort with more.",1254528000,3,844,4.441558441558442
8155206,5,B000K9KTAC,"Excellent instruction from an excellent fiddler!  Nice selection of tunes with many helpful hints and exercises to get that Scottish sound with your fiddling. The ""Extras"" menu has a series of short clips under ""Tune Highlights"" which is very helpful for quickly accessing a number of ornamentation and playing hints. Perfect for an intermediate who plays by ear. I certainly hope she makes more instructional DVDs at the intermediate or advanced level in the future!",1249862400,3,467,5.226666666666667
8155207,5,B000K9KTAC,"I am really enjoying this DVD. I play by ear anyway, so her teaching style was just right, but if you don't play by ear there is a booklet included with all the written music. You also get a close up of her fingers as she is playing so it is easy to see what the notes are. If I am dissapointed in anything it would be that there does not seem to be an ""advanced"" DVD to follow this one up, and I'd also like more songs and more lessons. There are 6 lessons on this one I believe. I think Sarah should make another DVD now! The tunes were not too difficult but you can make them more complexed as you advance, and they are also easier tunes to speed up. That makes this DVD good for quite a wide range of ""intermediate"" abilities.",1239753600,2,730,4.006849315068493
8155208,5,B000K9KTAC,"Whoa! She's good. If there is a flaw it has to do with identifying the actual notes being played. As she plays through the piece to be learned she breaks it down into do-able chunks, but you must LISTEN since she doesn't name the notes played. This is true also for the Beginner tape. For an intermediate player this actually should not be a serious problem, but if you're ear isn't quite what it ought, proceed... but with a bit of caution.

However, since the tunes are good and the teacher is great.... well.... perhaps it's time to just push the ears a bit....",1212624000,6,564,4.423076923076923
