8336585,3,B001QVJRKG,I like this series of DVDs.  The quality isn't great but the dancers are.  These two episodes were long stories (told through dance).  I don't find them as entertaining as their other dances.  Even though they explain the story behind the dance ahead of time it just doesn't work for me.,1371513600,,287,4.568627450980392
