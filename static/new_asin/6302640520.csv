494847,4,6302640520,"CAVALCADE is an extremely good example of films made in the first few years following the advent of sound, an era in which actors, directors, writers, and cinematographers struggled to find a new style that could comfortably accomodate the new technology.  During this period, many actors and writers were drawn from the stage--only to discover that what seems real and natural in the theatre seems heavily mannered on screen.

This is certainly the case with CAVALCADE.  The film presents the story of two London families whose lives intertwine between 1900 and 1933.  The film begins with the upperclass Marryot family and their servants, Mr. and Mrs. Bridges, facing the Boer War--and then through a series of montages and montage-like scenes follows the fortunes of the two families as they confront changing codes of manners and social class and various historic events ranging from the sinking of the Titanic to World War I.

From a modern standpoint, the really big problem with the film is the script.  CAVALCADE was written for the stage by Noel Coward, who was one of the great comic authors of the 20th Century stage--but the sparkling edge that seems so flawless in his comic works acquires a distastefully ""precious"" quality when applied to drama.  Although the play was a great success in its day, it is seldom revived, and the dialogue of the film version leaves one in little doubt of why: it feels ridiculously artificial, and that quality is emphasized by the ""grand manner"" of the cast.

That said, the cast--in spite of the dialogue and their stylistically dated performances--is quite good.  This is particularly true of the two leading ladies, Diana Wynyard and Una O'Connor (best known for her appearances in THE INVISIBLE MAN and THE BRIDE OF FRANKESTEIN), both of whom have memorable screen presences that linger in mind long after the film ends.  The material is also quite interesting and startlingly modern; although it is more covert than such films as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, CAVALCADE has a decidedly anti-war slant, and the characters in the film worry about where technology (which has produced such horrors as chemical warfare by World War I) will take them in the future.

I enjoyed the film.  At the same time, I would be very hesitant to recommend it to any one that was not already interested in films of the early 1930s, for I think most contemporary viewers would have great difficulty adjusting to the tremendous difference in style.  The VHS (the film is not yet available on DVD) has some problem with visual elements and a more significant problem with audio elements, but these are not consistent issues.  Recommended--but with the warning that if you don't already like pre-code early ""talkies"" you will likely be disappointed.",1048636800,49,2781,4.9655172413793105
494848,4,6302640520,"Noel Coward's homage to the bygone era of Edwardian England.  A long and somewhat lumpy script tracks one upper-upper class family's trials through 1899-1933, as their paths intersect the Boer War, WWI, and the Titanic... Oddly enough, considering Coward's bon vivant temprament, the movie seems to condemn the libertine sensibilities of the Jazz Era (great glimpses of the action, though, including a gay couple exchanging gifts in a nightclub...) and exalts the more traditional English reserve. An interesting film, although in retrospect WWII loomed large in the background...",1041465600,8,580,5.590909090909091
494849,3,6302640520,"It is difficult to believe that this film won the 1933 Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year. It is a somewhat dull, tedious affair, based upon a Noel Coward play of some popularity. The screenplay by Reginald Berkeley evidently lost something in the adaptation, as it has little to commend it.

The movie chronicles a span of over three decades through the lives of two British families, one upstairs, the other, downstairs. The upstairs family, the Marryots, and their maid and butler, the dowstairs Bridges family, undergo tremendous changes as world events spin out of control, impacting on them in unimaginable ways.

The movie begins with the ringing in of the twentieth century. Both families, employer and employee, welcome in the New Year together and toast each other, little knowing the changes that the twentieth century will bring each one of them. As time goes on, the relationship between the two families begins to change, as class distinctions begin to erode. A montage of historical world events, the Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria, World War I, and the jazz age continue to shape and mold them in a pastiche of human drama.

While it sounds as if it could be interesting, it is not particularly so. One never really gets to know any of the characters nor care about them. While it is a highly stylistic film, it is one that has not aged very well as a storytelling vehicle. It is just not that interesting a film, though it is highly atmospheric and would, therefore, be of some interest to nostalgia buffs and those who love vintage films.",1012694400,5,1571,4.747252747252747
494850,3,6302640520,"""Cavalcade"" directed by Frank Lloyd is probably best known (to those who have actually heard of it) as one of the most forgettable Oscar winners ever! It's a sad fact but true. Diana Wynyard stars as Jane Marryot. The Marryot's are an upper class English family, and are struggling with the same problems people of every class are struggling with. Like the Bridges whom happen to be their servents, they are played by Herbert Mumdin (Alfred Bridges) and Una O' Conners (Ellen Bridges). Originally a play by Noel Coward, the screenplay by Reginald Berkeley doesn't provide us with an interesting portrait inside both families. For example, we don't even know how long each couple has been together. We don't know how old they are, we don't know how old their childern are. We don't know how the Marryot family came into wealth. It's simple things like this we would like to know. But, I must admit at times we do feel for these people. Certain sad events take place, and we found ourselves actually caring and getting caught into the movie. But, not enough of these moments happen where I would dare give this film a 4 or 5 star rating. Even though I didn't care for the screenplay very much, there are highpoints to the film. I liked the acting by Diana Wynyard (She was nominated for an award) and her husband Clive Brook (Robert Marryot). The directing by Lloyd was good also. And, one of my favorite moments in the film Ursula Jean (Fanny Bridges) singing ""20th Century Blues"". One of my favorite Coward songs. The reviwer below me mentioned Coward's ""In Which We Serve"" that movie was a better film. We cared for the characters in that film more than we do in this film. But, even though many many people would not go for a movie like this today, it's still not a waste of time to watch it. At least give it a try. This movie was nominated for 4 Oscars, it won three; ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", and ""Art Direction"". It's not great but does prove to be entertaining.",993340800,6,1975,4.566197183098591

Then emerge victorious during the Boer War. While the husband's of both the upper and lower classes both head off to fight in the Boer War. Many scenes throughout the movie of thousands of extras. Superb cinemaphotography. Clive Brook is outstanding throughout the movie. So is the actress Diana Wynyard. And despite other reviews on here. The acting style is not dated at all. If anything it is a marvelous superb example of its era. And is vastly superior to any production made today. There is no CGI nonsense here. These are all real people indeed. They experience the death of Queen Victoria. One of the actor's playing Diana Wynyard's two sons happens to be on the Titanic with his fiancee during their I'll fated Honeymoon. Then you have the nationalistic spirit meeting head on the beginnin of the First World War. .Which ultimately leads to horror. The movie feels like a Upstairs - downstairs sort of thing. Many fine performances by all the character actor's involved besides the main cast. More tragedies are to follow. That doesn't mean there aren't any happy moments throughout the film. There are . But they get overshadowed by the huge tragic events all around them. Finally the film enters the 1920's . And the Contrast Between The Victorian era and the Jazz Age is a quite startling change. But done very appropriately depicting the change in the culture of the times. All the actors involved exude class. None  of their performances are stage bound like others here have remarked. It is superb acting by everyone throughout the film.. And finally the movie approaches the New Years Eve of 1932 with 1933 on the way. No one could know that the election of Hitler in Germany would eventually impact England and the world much later on. This movie won 3 Oscars.  And deservedly so. The Blu Ray /DVD Combo has the bonus materials on the regular DVD also even though the back of the DVD Combo case doesn't make that clear. So for those of you who haven't bought Blu Ray yet, don't worry you will hear the commentary on the DVD edition as well. And First Honors a short film acknowledging the honors received the film at the Oscars. By Clive Brook and Diana Wynyard. They are both worth discovering again for new comers and those already familiar with them. This is a must own collection .

This film is a series of jingoist stereotypical vignettes glorifying everything English, including class barriers, lack of emotions, and death in war.  After the fifth ""I love you so awfully"", watching became painful.  I only stuck it out to the end because I wondered how much worse it could get.  It got worse.

495165,5,6302640520,"The film is now over 80 years old, but holds up very well. The production values were fine for the era. Some of the crowd scenes were impressive and complex and certain lush settings obviously impressed critics. The stage-style acting will not have bothered too many viewers. After all, movies were usually considered to be 'filmed plays' by critics and were often judged accordingly. The story has a nice blend of Noel Coward nostalgia and patriotism and the theme is rather tragic, something that has eluded a few current critics. At the end the two major characters - now both frail and elderly - look back on the past in the knowledge that they have lost everyone close to or dear to them. They are isolated and unable to come to terms with a new age they probably see as ugly and alien. Interesting point - despite the foregoing, there is very little sentimentality in the film.

Cavalcade was a huge hit in both the States and Britain because audiences were probably drawn in by the factors just mentioned. It was a post-World War depression era production and times were disrupted and uncertain - and many folk had suffered or were about to suffer. Audiences identified with the characters and the theme. After the next World War 'Cavalcade' was successfully revived in Britain and some of her offshoots - perhaps even in the States.",1388707200,6,1340,4.726495726495727

I don't like those kind of ""episodes"" movies. So its the first dissapointing.

495234,4,6302640520,"Noel Coward's CAVALCADE was a huge success in its day and is now a time capsule of British attitudes after the First World War and the Roaring 20s that followed. It can easily be seen as the precursor of several period BBC dramas which came much later including the iconic UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS and now DOWNTON ABBEY. The storyline focuses on two families. One of them is upper class while the other family is from their household staff. Robert and Jane Marryot (Clive Brook & Diana Wynyard) live in a posh London home presided over by servants Alfred and Ellen Bridges (Herbert Mundin & Una O'Connor). The Marryots have two sons, Edward & Joey, while the Bridges' have a newborn baby girl, Fanny. The film opens in 1899 with Robert and Alfred setting out to fight in the Boer War. After the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, the Bridges' leave and open a pub and things start to go downhill for them from there. Robert is later knighted for his military service but shortly thereafter a tragic event occurs. And so it goes. We see a series of vignettes of both families over the next 30 years ending the year the film was made, 1933.

To direct Coward's 1931 play, Fox Film (no Twentieth Century-Fox yet) chose Scottish born director Frank Lloyd who had made a memorable silent version of Charles Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES for them earlier. Lloyd would win a Best Director Oscar for CAVALCADE and another 2 years later for his best known film, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY. While parts of the film are dated by today's standards it must be remembered that this is a very British film from a very British writer. It is also remarkably anti-war as well as nostalgic for the passing of the Victorian & Edwardian eras. It was CAVALCADE's pacifist message that impressed audiences back in 1933 which also explains why it disappeared for so many years. It remains a remarkable achievement but the very theatrical performances and lack of subtlety won't make it most people's cup of tea unless you happen to be an Anglophile in which case you'll definitely find it to be of more than historical interest. CAVALCADE is the last Best Picture Oscar winner to make it to DVD and it does so in this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack for its 80th anniversary.

495319,3,6302640520,I purchased this DVD on my quest to see all of the Best Picture Winners.  It was interesting in it's historical value; spanning thirty years from the Boer War near the turn of the century to the 1930's.  I rated it OK although it was probably a great film for the time.,1331164800,,269,4.153846153846154

495322,1,6302640520,"""Cavalcade"" very effectively ruins the simplistic notion that movies speak
in a ""universal language"" that withstands the passage of time. This film
feels like it came from another planet. It's odd how different the varying
media of art can be in this respect. I can look at a Renoir or a Van Gogh
or a Picasso and still feel a connection, but with films such as Cavalcade
I simply can't get hooked up. By the way, if you really want to buy a DVD
for a film of this vintage, you can search Google for ""(buy) (title of film)
(date of release) (one of the major stars)"" . In this case, your search term
would be ""buy cavalcade 1933 clive brook"" . If you do this Google search,
you will find that a DVD of ""Cavalcade"" is available for around $5.00. The
truly hilarious thing is simply this: The languages available are English
and Chinese. I can't imagine a freakier party film than Cavalcade dubbed
in Chinese! Really and truly, my mind boggles! What would it be like?
Could I survive laughing that hard without seriously injuring myself? Would
my overloaded brain explode with hilarity? You can buy it and try it if you
dare, you can watch Clive Brook defending the British Empire in an emotional
outburst of Cantonese rhetoric, but I refuse to be responsible for what
this might do to your mind or your soul.",1306713600,,1307,4.495798319327731

495327,3,6302640520,"Certainly not one of the greatest films ever made, but it is interesting to watch the progress being made in film-making by comparing Academy Award winners for Best Picture.",1252627200,,173,5.0
495372,4,6302640520,"It's probably telling that CAVALCADE is one of two Academy Award ""Best Picture"" winners yet to be released on DVD (in Region 1). If ever a film screamed ""DATED!"" this would be it.  If, like me, you don't automatically assume datedness to be a bad thing, however, you'll welcome the chance to view this rare Noel Coward drama in whatever format is available.  We are lucky to have it.

One could make the case that all but the most abstract or fantastical narratives are somehow about human beings caught up in the grand sweep of history.  But there is something especially interesting about works where that kind of portrayal is clearly the author's primary intent.

CAVALCADE chronicles the lives of two London families--one upper class, one lower-- from New Year's Eve 1899 to New Year's Eve 1929.  It is a classic ""upstairs/downstairs"" scenario,  with a slight twist that suggests significant social changes at the turn of the last century.  The servant family, the Bridges, take advantage of a business opportunity, and with some reluctance, opt to leave their masters' employ and strike out on their own.  (The results are not all that felicitous, which might be interpreted in a variety of ways, I imagine.)  The upper class Marryots experience social advancement on their own elevated level as well (when Mr. Marryot is knighted), but they experience heartache as well (the tragic loss of two sons).

Joy and sorrow.  Gain and loss.  You could say it's the same old story.  But each story, ultimately, is unique--if only because each story is lived out by unique individuals.  Yes, it's harder to get to know well characters from other times and places, but it IS possible.  In fact, it's often easier to understand characters as products of their time and culture when you're viewing them from a remove.

At least one previous reviewer has commented on the subtle anti-war sentiments in the film.  The play on which it was based was perceived as being proudly nationalistic, but it is doubtful that an ironist like Coward would have intended anything quite so simple.  The anti-war sentiments are uttered mainly by the cast's female characters, which even in the 1930s meant that they could be readily dismissed (unfortunately).  A contemporary viewer might tend to actually hear what these wives and mothers of soldiers are saying quite clearly.

War and rumors of war are the film's touchstones.  The film begins with the men of both the upper class and the lower class families proudly marching off to fight the Boers in South Africa.  The characters do not know it, but this war marks the end of an era.  War as adventure, as an hororable and noble pursuit, was a given.  AND they were short.  Sixteen years later,  the horrifying era of modern warfare had begun with the ""War to End All Wars.""  As the film ends in 1929,  storm clouds are starting to brew once again.  Yes, our principle characters will continue to try to face whatever comes with a sense of honor and dignity--stiff upper lip and all that--but they've seen the dramatic changes the earliest years of the 20th century have brought.  The future can't help but be at least somewhat daunting.",1246060800,4,3169,4.83457249070632
495373,2,6302640520,"Cavalcade has not aged well; it's difficult to believe this was the best picture winner of 1933. Alternately stilted and maudlin, frequently jingoistic, it hardly bears any resemblance to the witty and brittle Noel Coward we're used to. It also seems a filmed play rather than a work intended for the screen.
The one thing the film has going for it is its evocation of period, but then, 1933 wasn't so very far away from the historical events depicted in the movie. The little musical hall styled vignettes seem authentic enough.
This isn't a gloriously restored print but it's adequate. At times the syncing between sound and mouth movements is a little off- it's best not to watch their lips too carefully.
There's a good reason this is one of only two Oscar best picture winners not released on a region 1 disc.",1243382400,2,814,4.699300699300699
495374,1,6302640520,"Cavalcade is not that great a movie, and the pickings must have been pretty slim the year it won the oscar for Best Picture. But whether you like the film or not? This Chinese import version is HORRIBLE! The picture looks as though someone turned out the lights during filming, and the scenes are so dark, it's nearly impossible to see what's going on at all? The sound quality is even worse than the picture, with at least a two to three second delay between what you see on the screen and what you hear? Meaning that you see the actors saying their lines, but have to wait a few seconds to hear what they actually said. I'm not sure when, or even if the movie will finally be released to DVD by a legitimate, region 1 studio? But do yourself a favor and wait it out. Because having this version is far worse than not having it at all, no matter how badly you'd like to add it to your collection? (2 used & new from 78 bucks? I'll let you have mine for half the price! lol)",1222819200,23,974,4.158730158730159
495375,5,6302640520,"We lost both of our children.  This movie helped us ,to not feel so alone. It`s an excellent movie.",1199750400,3,99,4.2105263157894735
495376,3,6302640520,"I know that in the early days of talking pictures that scripts and dialogue were often uninspired as everybody in the motion picture industry had to get used to the idea of telling stories through the spoken word rather than with only gestures and facial expressions, but by the time Cavalcade came out this period was pretty much over. The competition in the year this film won Best Picture, such as ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" and ""Lady for a Day"", pretty much prove this point. Thus the fact that you never really get to know these characters or their feelings can't be totally attributed to adjustments to a new art form.

As someone else already mentioned, the film will probably remind you of the series ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", just without the heart or insight of that show. I know it's impossible to weave a tale in a two hour movie with the same level of sophistication that you can in a long-running TV series, but I really expected to care more about the events and characters portrayed than I did at the end of the film. One definition of the word ""cavalcade"" is ""procession"", and that pretty much sums up the film's problems. You just feel that both yourself and the characters are watching events proceed through the decades after the turn of the century, and you never feel any real involvement of the either yourself or the characters in those events.

This movie seems to excel when it is using the pure visual medium of film to convey a feeling. For example, there is a scene where Mrs. Marryot is in the act of lighting a cigarette when she spots a nurse doing the same for a wounded soldier in her care. Mrs. Marryot's attention is drawn to the wounded soldier to the point that she forgets what she is doing and the match goes out in her hands. The sight of the soldier brings out the fears she has for her own son to whom she has just said goodbye as he goes off to fight in World War I. Maybe some of the problems of the film just can't be helped given the time in which it was made. The film ends in the depths of the depression, and tries to show a hopeful note. The ending seems awkward, but that may be because we know today what nobody could have known in 1933 - that things were about to get much worse. The depression would drag on for years, and the aftermath of World War I was in the process of setting the stage for the second World War.

This is a good movie, but not a great one. The most interesting thing about it is that it acts as a time capsule and allows you to see past events through the eyes of people who lived in the 1930's and helps clear up some of the questions as to why everyone was so hesitant to get involved in stopping Germany's military build-up prior to World War II until it was too late.",1176422400,2,2755,4.2942307692307695

Since this is a Best Picture winner, it is a shame that the only Region 1 DVD containing this movie has gone out of print. However, it is not such essential viewing that I would pay the outrageous price that people are demanding for used copies. Since the original DVD copy of this movie was produced in 2002, more than likely it has only gone out of print temporarily while it is being remastered using more modern DVD technology, and will be released once again on DVD at some point in the future.",1172793600,24,3257,4.306688417618271
495378,5,6302640520,"We always think of Noel Coward as being this hip, ironic, sophisticated glibster but at heart he wasall mush and my, oh my, did he love England, everything about it, especially its aristocracy.  CAVALCADE the movie is a faithful recreation of his showstopping London hit, the one that made him a respectable man of the theater, instead of just an angry young man.  If you had a copy of his play in hand while following the movie you would see how extraordinarily the screenplay follows the show, though director Frank Lloyd fails to make use of cinema techniques (like a split screen) that must have been available to him even in the early talkie days?  However it's not as clunky or static as some have made out, and scene after scene unrolls at a stately, but yet somehow hypnotic and indeed sometimes shocking clip.

Diana Wynyard isn't to everyone's taste but if you like your Norma Shearer and wish that she had somehow surpassed her own levels of emotional hysteria, than Diana is the girl for you!  She's like a manic Norma Shearer, her expressive eyes and quivering contralto like Shearer squared.  Watch her long fleshy arms as she reaches down to hug her little boy.  If she said any more with them she'd have been arrested.  Occasionally her servant counterpart, Una O'Connor, threatens to steal the show from Wynyard, but that don't happen, even in the fantastic scenes when the two women quarrel over their children's plan to marry.

William Cameron Menzies gave the screen some of its finest special effects and art design, and here the bombing of London during World War I, while Fanny and Joey watch from a nearby balcony, is magnificent and horrifying at the same time, like Thomas Pynchon's GRAVITY'S RAINBOW.  The montage at the end of CAVALCADE has got to be one of the most astounding sequences ever filmed, as Lloyd and Coward show us flashes of different responses to postwar ""unfaith,"" a Communist demagogue, a Christian priest (preaching to a near-empty congregation), an armament mogul, an atheist (""God is too crude a superstition to foist on our children""--cinema hasn't been so bold in seventy years since!), and finally a slow pan across a decadent 20s sex party, in which every sort of sexuality is on display, a young girl frightened at the advances of a middle-aged woman; a pair of he-men swapping bracelets; one young vamp, bending slightly to adjust volume on an art deco radio cabinet, radiates sin with the movement of a single finger.",1169596800,28,2473,4.811320754716981
495379,3,6302640520,"It is difficult to believe that this film won the 1933 Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year. It is a somewhat dull, tedious affair, based upon a Noel Coward play of some popularity. The screenplay by Reginald Berkeley evidently lost something in the adaptation, as it has little to commend it.

The movie chronicles a span of over three decades through the lives of two British families, one upstairs, the other, downstairs. The upstairs family, the Marryots, and their maid and butler, the dowstairs Bridges family, undergo tremendous changes as world events spin out of control, impacting on them in unimaginable ways.

The movie begins with the ringing in of the twentieth century. Both families, employer and employee, welcome in the New Year together and toast each other, little knowing the changes that the twentieth century will bring each one of them. As time goes on, the relationship between the two families begins to change, as class distinctions begin to erode. A montage of historical world events, the Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria, World War I, and the jazz age continue to shape and mold them in a pastiche of human drama.

While it sounds as if it could be interesting, it is not particularly so. One never really gets to know any of the characters nor care about them. While it is a highly stylistic film, it is one that has not aged very well as a storytelling vehicle. It is just not that interesting a film, though it is highly atmospheric and would, therefore, be of some interest to nostalgia buffs and those who love vintage films.",1158710400,,1571,4.747252747252747
