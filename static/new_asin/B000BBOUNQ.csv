8084755,3,B000BBOUNQ,"A dimensional portal was opened 33 years ago. Aliens known as The JAM came through and attacked Earth. The military was able to drive them back to their home world, where the fight continues. Lt. Fukai pilots a jet with an advanced AI on board. It is called Yukikaze. The war is at a stalemate, but the existence of Yukikaze could turn things around. It may be a blessing, or even a curse. One thing is certain. The war is about to end.

This anime is very strange. I think that it's one of those that will likely create huge fans or ardent naysayers. I have mixed feelings. I think that the plot was pretty well done. It's a lot like Robotech. The major flaw with this series is the character development. A series as short as this doesn't really have much chance to develop good characters. None of the characters have any personality. They are empty and lifeless, except for Major Bukhar. The story moves very slowly, but manages to keep you relatively interested in what is going to happen next.

The production quality is very good for a series from 2002. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are very well done. They obviously took care to make a quality product. It's not a bad series, it's just not my cup of tea. I like characters with lots of emotion and depth, in addition to a great story. If you feel the same as me, you should probably avoid this title.

When I first started watching Yukikaze, I gave up after episode 1. It was very strange and moved very slow. After a couple of months, I stared again at episode 2. Things start to get more normal, and the series gains a little depth. Even so, the lack of character depth and drama makes it an average watch in my opinion. Like I said before, I think most will either love it or hate it. I can't recommend buying this OVA before you've seen it. I think you should watch it online before spending your money. I kind of wish that I had. I can't see myself watching it again. I'll probably sell this DVD.",1361145600,,1981,4.377717391304348
8084756,4,B000BBOUNQ,"Frankly, I really do enjoy this anime, which may seem kind of odd since it's of a little slower pace and a little vague, like you've been dropped in the middle of a story. But they do tell you things gradually and by the end you're going ""Ooooh, well dude"" and it makes a lot more sense. But it's interesting that it's set up that way, and how few characters it really, really focuses on. The relationship between Rei and Yukikaze is also quite interesting, almost like a love story but not quite.

I do recommend this anime. If you're into really fast paced animes then this might drive you a little up the wall, but it doesn't have it's interesting points and you want to see what happens next, to know what happens in the end, to find out what happens to Rei and Yukikaze. The fight sequences are also pretty capturing, I enjoyed them, and the ending is left open for you to go ""What if?"" and ""This might have happened this or that way"", etc. It's an interesting anime.",1335744000,,972,4.34065934065934
8084757,5,B000BBOUNQ,"This anime is a good one to have,the story line and the graphics are in good detail. I wouldn't miss out on any episode or you would miss out on the key points of the story. Check it out you might like the anime.",1270425600,,212,3.840909090909091
