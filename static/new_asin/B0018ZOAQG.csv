8271452,5,B0018ZOAQG,"This 2007 documentary on the Catholic faith habits of Major League Baseball players runs 105 minutes and includes several special features on the DVD. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of this video, which feels more like ESPN than EWTN, and at the vulnerability of the professional players interviewed. The video feels fresh and undated despite the 2007 copyright. You will learn a lot about the personal struggles of several pro baseball players and coaches who rely on their Christian faith to get them through life. Most or all appear to be Catholic, but there is nothing sectarian or pushy about the way they present their religious practices, which will appeal to all Christians of good faith. This is a great video for people of all ages, young as well as old, and particularly those who struggle to practice their faith in the midst of athletic commitments. It's uplifting and inspiring -- this is one documentary that lives up to the hype!",1399939200,,961,4.865853658536586
