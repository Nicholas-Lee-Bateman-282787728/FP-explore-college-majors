3441235,5,B0019M7KT2,"I have read Anthony's books first. Then I saw one of his TV shows ""by accident"" while switching through the channels. I wanted more. So I rent all DVDs during my last vacation in the US and watched them in a row.

Now, one year later, I wanted to see some of his shows again as I am interested in visiting some of the places he went, and as I am also a hunter for good local food and specialites, I decided to buy all his DVDs here on Amazon. And I have soooo much fun with them.

You see other views of a country, not the typical tourist paths. Food you wouldn't dare to touch or put it in your mouth - he does it for us. Great guy. Can't wait to go to Sicily and try that strange fried meat-parts hidden under a towel from these old men on the streets, too. Or the melon gelly with pistachios and dark chocolate bits.... Yummie!

These are short movies you can watch several times. They are fun, interesting, educational and like a nice trip to a foreign world in times you get ""itchy feet"" and wanna do at least some couchvacation....

Buy all at once, because you will like the first, and then you regret you have to pay extra postal service for the others.... ;-)

Have fun

3441236,5,B0019M7KT2,"I love Tony Bourdain! His show is so interesting, educational, and a laugh! He sure helps but North American minds to work in appreciating cultures were as most people would be ignorant and dismissive. I can't wait til he gets to season 10! Never get sick of this show or his experiences! Go Tony Go!",1217808000,7,300,4.472727272727273
3441237,5,B0019M7KT2,"Yes, I haven't actually watched this DVD yet since it doesn't come out for a few days but I've seen every season of ""No Reservations"" and it's the best travel/food show on television.  Bourdain is a chef who actually laughs at himself (and he likes the Ramones).  What more could you ask for.",1217721600,7,292,4.490566037735849
3441238,1,B0019M7KT2,"Overall you would have to say that this series takes a extreme political position towards the left.  Its less of a food or travel show as it is a political airing of a drunk, usless washed up loser the main protaginst Mr. Bourdain.  Its unfortunate after a promosing first season this show quickly crumbled in its second season and this season is no different.",1217548800,,360,4.609375
3441268,4,B0019M7KT2,"I've been a pretty big fan of Bourdain's food-centric travelogues since Food Network debuted the A Cook's Tour show and the accompanying book (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Cook-s-Tour-Global-Adventures-in-Extreme-Cuisines/dp/0060012781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Cook's Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines</a>).  From his auto-bio/expose on the restaurant business&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Ed-Adventures-in-the-Culinary-Underbelly-P-S/dp/0060899220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitchen Confidential Updated Ed: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (P.S.)</a>, to his unrestricted palette of taste, through to his no nonsense style of writing food inspired crime fiction, Bourdain has cut an interesting niche in the foodie world.  With No Reservations, he's left behind the insanity of the Food Network and taken his travels in search of good food and culture to the Travel Channel.

What I find interesting about this new show is the balance he's seemingly struck between his own tendencies and the requirements of filming a network driven travel show.  On A Cook's tour it came across as butting heads with the network and producers resulting in a lackluster second season filled with excursions to ridiculous destinations like the Mall of America, content that felt forced and sad.  No Reservations, though occasionally still succumbing to these depths, frees Bourdain up to getting to the heart of the matter which is examining true local culture and the food that sustains and elevates it.  It combines the point of view of a 70s punk rebel with a soul searching existentialist, while also ditching most of the pretension and being generally entertaining TV which is pretty darn rare.

If you're looking for the insanity of A Cook's Tour (the swallowing of still beating cobra hearts, etc.) than you might be a bit disappointed, but if the first thought when entering a new city or country is locating a good genuine meal that speaks to the local culture than this is the show for you.  It's not a how-to for finding the tourist traps of the world, but a how to avoid these and eat like a local.  Highlights from this set include French Polynesia, Russia, and surprisingly Los Angeles.

There are currently 3 other seasons available:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Collection-1/dp/B000LPS2TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations - Collection 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Collection-2/dp/B000XXWDZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Bourdain - No Reservations Collection 2</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Collection-Four/dp/B0026IQTPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations - Collection Four</a>.",1246838400,,3020,7.204359673024523

3441271,5,B0019M7KT2,"Better DVD product from the Travel Channel.  Most of season three's episodes are included in this collection.  (Four episodes from season three can be found in collection 2).  I also found it odd that the Travel Channel decided to include two episodes from season four (Singapore and Berlin) in this collection, but this is the best ""No Reservations"" DVD offering so far.  I am looking forward to the next collection, which will hopefully include the remaining 15 or so episodes from season four.",1237420800,,496,4.9397590361445785
3441272,5,B0019M7KT2,"I really enjoy watching this 3 DVD collection. My favorite show on the collection, is Cleveland because of the extra work with cartooning that was done on the show.

Even when he is visiting a place he is not enjoying he always finds a way to entertain hiimself and the audience with some honest and wry observations.  A fun travel host and great writer.  I recommend his show and writings for a fun relaxing time.  Party on.",1233532800,8,386,4.319444444444445

The commands do not operate.  Sometimes you are able to play a program, other times they will not play.  Very inconsistent and unreliable.  I ordered this collection twice to be sure that I did not just receive a defective disc set.  The same unreliability and play inconsistencies applied to the second collection, which Amazon sent to me free of charge to replace the first ordered collection.

I certainly hope the production quality improves with the next collection offered for sale.",1224892800,6,661,5.150943396226415

8274613,5,B0019M7KT2,"This was the first season of this series I had ever seen. Now I am a huge fan and have seen many other seasons, plus A Cook's Tour. My favorite episodes of No Reservations Collection 3 are:

1) Russia - watch the great antics with Tony and Zamir. Zamir is the local ""fixer"" who steals the show. Zamir shows Tony the exterior of the KGB headquarters. They then have lunch with a former head of the KGB and his wife. Tony flys on a Russian fighter jet in this one. Don't miss it.

2) New York - Tony gives a tour of his hometown. He eats some Grays hot dogs at his favorite local hot dog place with a cab driver. The episode opens with an homage to the movie Taxi Driver. I did not realize this when I first saw it. Then I bought Collection 6 and they talked about it in the bonus features section about the past 100 episodes. Tony also goes to Brighton Beach to have some tasty Russian food and see a show. Later he eats a sheeps head with some of his chef friends in New York City at a secret location.

3) Shanghai - the crab and dumplings look awesome! One special kind of local crab even has a barcode to prevent counterfeiting. Tony also eats some stinky tofu. While the title of this episode is Shanghai a large portion of this episode takes place in other parts of China such as Yunan Province. I enjoyed this episode a lot.

4) Hong Kong - this episode makes me want to go there right now. The seafood looks great. Stir fried spicy crab cooked on a boat in the harbor. Tony also does some interesting martial arts fight scenes. They go to the racetrack but don't have much luck there. But they are very lucky finding delicious food later on.

5) French Polynesia - I have never been a huge art fan but the scenes on Gaugin's life were amazing. This was my favorite episode. The first part of this episode takes place in Tahiti. Tony has lunch with a French restaurant owner in the capital city of Pape'ete. This part of Tahiti isn't the paradise he expected. He then flys to Rangiroa (an atoll) and the Marquesas Islands and finds paradise. He eats some delicious fish, sea urchin and coconut crab with the locals. He also visits Gaugin's gravesite.

6) Cleveland - this was a surprsingly good episode. Tony brings in his friend (nemesis) Michael Ruhlman to help him. They eat at Skyline Chili and have a sports car race. He visits a huge bookstore with a local author which was previously a Hostess Twinkie factory. Then they eat at a local deli restaurant where Ruhlman offends some of the guests with his language. Then Tony visits the Roll & Roll Hall of Fame with a member of the Ramones. They stuff themselves silly at a local restaurant.

7) Singapore - some of the best food in Singapore can be found in the food courts. Who knew? Tony eats chicken rice, which is Singapore's most famous dish. He also has chilli crab, shark's head and a spicy dish made with bone marrow which he loves. Finally there is a fishing scene where they actually catch some fish. Fishing scenes from previous episodes had always gone badly. Tony also goes for a foot massage. The doctor can tell he has lots of health issues just by massaging his feet. At least it is nothing serious.

I agree with another reviewer that South Carolina was the weakest of the episodes. But still it was not too bad.

If you liked previous collections you will like this one also. Tony is his usual sarcastic self.",1408579200,,3388,4.373608903020668
8274614,2,B0019M7KT2,Quite vulgar.  Can't show it to my students in a school culinary setting.  I don't feel crude language is necessary to get ones point across.,1394582400,,141,4.6

8274617,5,B0019M7KT2,"This collection of the superb No Reservations contains some of the best episodes the series has ever produced.  The Cleveland episode would certainly vie for the top ranking.  It features Mt. Bourdain verbally sparring with his ""nemesis"", the author Michael Ruhlman.  Mr. Ruhlman is a Cleveland native and he invites Mr. Bourdain out to Cleveland to show him how great of city it is.  Throughout they go to book store that is housed in an old Hostess factory complete with Twinkie filling still in the pipes and eat with the legendary Harvey Pekar (who provides commentary and scenes are show in cartoon ala his American Splendor series).  Mr. Bourdain goes to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with one of his idols Marky Ramone and then shares a meal with him at Michael Symon's Lola restaurant.  At the end, Mr. Bourdain & Mr. Ruhlman cook up a delicious looking feast at the Ruhlman home. Berlin is another standout episode with Mr. Bourdain showing how the city has come together all these years after the Wall fell.  The Russia episode finds him teaming back up with his old friend Zamir and the New York episode is a crossover with Bizarre Foods as he does some eating of weird animal parts with Andrew Zimmern.",1321488000,,1213,4.666666666666667
8274618,5,B0019M7KT2,"I always enjoy Bourdains books and videos. This collection included an episode about LA which is very interesting. Not so much about the food, but more about the people. Very cool",1276473600,,179,4.806451612903226

Edit some of the 50 to 60 puns and lame jokes out and maybe, just maybe it could be funny. Maybe the show would be better if he didn't try so hard to be funny and he wasn't such a wuss. Who named this guy a bad boy? Just because he smokes and drinks doesn't make him a ""bad boy"", toughen up Anthony and quit your whining.",1259280000,,452,3.978021978021978

8274621,5,B0019M7KT2,"The third installment of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations dvd collection continues his travels around the world including a fair amount of U.S. destinations. I prefer the more philosophical adventures he has and the food-centric ones are understandable as it is his forte. The only episode issues I have are the trivial and generic ones, such as his visit to South Carolina. It is a tired exploration of the clichd Southern hospitality, replete with a fox chase, garden party, Civil War re-enactment, and various other good-ole-Southern-charm fluff that is straight from Samantha Brown's itinerary. There are too many travel shows and food network garbage that specialize in this kind of shallow fare and it is a disappointment to see this from No Reservations. I understand the corporate push to broaden the market, but stuff like this never seems to be a good fit for Bourdain. Thankfully, the South Carolina show is the weakest of a strong bunch, thirteen in all.
The always fun Zamir adventure takes place in Russia and there are three trips to Southeast Asia including the frantic and food loving paradises of Singapore and Hong Kong. There is also an episode billed as Shanghai, but it is more an exploration of western China than the city per se and is one of the better inclusions on the collection. There is a funny trip back to a disappointingly clean and family-friendly New York then there is the piece de resistance of the collection; a brilliant graphic novel themed trip to Cleveland featuring American Splendor author Harvey Pekar and a cast of characters. Thankfully, Tony went there in the dead of winter and got the full-on Lake Erie wind chill joy that life in that city entails. Other episodes are Berlin, Tuscany, Brazil (Sao Paolo), and Argentina. Along with Cleveland and Shanghai, is one of my favorites. It targets French Polynesia and weaves a connective thread to Paul Gaugin, eschewing the tropical paradise predictability.
As with the previous collections in this series; these discs come without commentary, deleted scenes, or any other extras. Furthermore, the contents don't seem to jibe with what I've seen listed on other sites as being from season three per se. My guess is that the chopped up broadcasting schedule which airs a handful during one period than another group some months later creates confusion as to when one season ends and another begins. To be fair, the dvd box does say ""collection"" and not ""season,"" so there seems to be a method to their compilation, although I don't know what that is.
When No Reservations truly excels, it goes beyond a travel show or a food show and become more of a sociological and anthropological exploration. Bourdain seeks to find out what makes a community tick, what keeps people staying in places that often seem bleak and hopeless to the typical over-indulged American viewer, and what unites humanity on a sociological and cultural level. He does his historical homework and sits down with the people he meets to get at the heart of who they are and how they define themselves. By avoiding the tourist frivolity and focusing instead on the anthropological development as seen from the very people who shaped or have been shaped by it, we are provided with more than pretty sites and mouthwatering food. We are given a small sampling of the kind of deeper exploration of new places and new people that is truly at the heart of why those of us who have the travel bug aren't likely to be found in the obvious places. It is through this lens of higher level thought-provocation and contextual examination that we are able to see not only what makes one place different from another, but moreover, what makes it all the same. I'm confident you'll enjoy the trip. Bon voyage.",1249171200,5,3760,4.885758998435055
