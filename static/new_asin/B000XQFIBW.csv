8229225,1,B000XQFIBW,"Do not buy this, the EastWestDVD version of Dark Places (and Horror Express). This is a disgustingly cheap transfer from video (yes they have taken an old vhs copy as their source). It is pan-and-scan, blurry, utterly horrible. What a disgrace to see a Don Sharp movie treated in this manner. Oh, but nice packaging - EastWest must have absolutely no decency. Shame on that outfit for peddling this unspeakable travesty.",1226707200,13,420,4.929577464788732
