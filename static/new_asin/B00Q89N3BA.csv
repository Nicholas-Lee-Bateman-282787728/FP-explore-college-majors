6864100,5,B00Q89N3BA,"It's hard to believe that Trace Adkins - the northern Louisiana-born country singer who had a football career in college which ended with a injury - has been performing (and making hit records) for twenty years! This nearly-two-hour-long concert recorded in August 2014 at the Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY features all his hits - including ""Every Light in the House"" (which he performs at EVERY performance) - and a few new ones is a lot of fun. He sings and, sometimes plays (note that he is NOT the lead guitar player) guitar and talks very little between the songs.  That ""talk"" shows up in the 25 minute ""bonus interview"" which really give you the feeling that he is comfortable controlling his career and choosing his band members. Honestly, you don't usually get to hear Adkins talk or even take his hat off.

There is an eight page color booklet enclosed but the track list and the crew list take up three of those and the others are just photos.

The sound is great and I can't believe that and country music fan (well, modern country, ""hat act"" fans) wouldn't  enjoy this DVD package.
So, kick your shoes off, pop a beer and enjoy a two- our, 20 song, concert in your living room or den.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6864150,5,B00Q89N3BA,Live Country is great. I would recommend it to anyone who is a Trace fan.  He gives his all when he performs.  Have seen him at a few live shows.  He is a great entertainer.  I feel that his interview portion of this DVD shows him as a humble/genuine human being.  I had a meet and greet with him after a show at The Ryman a few years ago.  He was a gracious to the last people as he was to the first people in line.  He doesn't pretend to be someone he isn't.  He is what he is.,1424044800,5,479,3.7676767676767677
