8091030,5,B000BQ7J5C,"I bought this dvd about 10 years ago trying to collect all the Jess Franco titles.  Little did I know that now that I purchased such a rare find. Not that his effects have always been the best, in fact, terrible to say the least.  Found out it was an expensive dvd, just going to keep it as a collectible. No way am I going to sell it, as I was trying to weed out my ""soft porn"", to me, the collectability of the dvd is worth more to me than the quality of it's content.",1476489600,,470,3.8854166666666665

8091034,3,B000BQ7J5C,Older ladies not afraid to show it. They stand up well for what they're asked to do. If you're a fan of Fred and his team it's good.,1363651200,2,132,3.75
8091035,5,B000BQ7J5C,"The two movies on this box are really entertaining. They are perfect for that persons who likes the sex, seduction and terror in movies.

The picture quality is not the best (looks like a beta record) but its pretty good for the year on what they was made.

Watch with your girlfriend (or boyfriend) if she like the same genre than you..

The only negative point is that dvd don't have any subtitles (even english), what made me a lot of work to explain to my girlfriend what is happening in all the movie (she undestand the written english, but not much the spoken). In a global world it was a interesting thing that the producers may take in count.",1226361600,4,650,4.4
8091036,5,B000BQ7J5C,"In a sense Jess Franco's ""Tender Flesh"" and ""Lust For Frankenstein"" are throwbacks to the earliest age of cinema: as the soundtracks of both films are garbled, often unintelligible, they result in essentially silent movies.  I suggest, however, that such silence does not constitute a handicap: in fact, it concentrates the viewer's attention on the films' purely visual aspects, which are quite wonderful.  These are truly ""motion pictures""--visionary works that few directors (besides Jess Franco himself) can ever hope to equal.

  As their titles imply, the two films unleash an abundance of wild, almost indescribable eroticism.  At all times the director's visual genius is pervasive, his feverish imagination unfaltering.  Thus he lends even the most ferocious sexual encounters an artistic integrity that is light years beyond the commercial shoddiness called ""porn.""  In effect, Franco uses flesh and lust to convey a variety of emotional/mental states--ranging from extreme Romanticism (sexuality and spirit become identical) to the most outrageous brutality (evoking a world in which appetite alone prevails).  Whatever cosmic view Franco explores, he does so with a true artist's candor--and the results are genuinely exhilarating, stunning.

  I recommend both ""Tender Flesh"" and ""Lust For Frankenstein"" to the fortunate few--to those visionaries and artists who shamelessly love the shameless medium of film.  What adventures await you!  These films are not made for the uncreative, neo-puritan masses, however.  I hope that all would-be censors will continue to stay focused on televised ball games, the latest Academy Awards sponges and similar species of Rot Americana... Jess Franco's uncompromising, amoral brilliance will always remain at odds with those poor souls who confuse moving pictures with their own moral prejudices.",1141344000,15,1846,5.686131386861314
