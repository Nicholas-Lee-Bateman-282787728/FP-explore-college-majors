Thank you. Gilles.",1443744000,,82,4.928571428571429
8165761,5,B000M2E34U,This video is watched again and again by my four year old grand daughter.  She likes to explain what's going on to Papaw and I really enjoy watching it with her.,1358812800,,161,4.193548387096774
8165762,3,B000M2E34U,"I guess I prefer my nature films unsullied by the naturalists.

Especially shots of them in their offices somewhere in Southern California off the beach. And the relatively extended scene of him climbing the mountain so he can take a picture of the penguins in order to count them can be done without the drama of how dangerous it is, someone obviously climbed the mountain first and left a rope to use in order to climb the mountain.

Some nice shots of penguins, and using the 'critter cam' to ride along to see how they feed...well, sort of, they mostly describe how the penguin dives down and then swoops up to snag an ice fish, showing the final seconds of the penguin gobbling down fish after fish, but not any swooping, which I assume would make for a really lousy video since the camera was riding on back of a penguin, who are notoriously lax when it comes to making sure the lighting is good and keeping the camera steady.

Anyway, I LOVE penguin movies, the real nature shows, for some reason there is something about penguins that resonate in me. For the last several years, we've been blessed with March of the Penguins, the Planet Earth series and Frozen World. A lot of the penguin action is repetitive, the Adelie's scampering, the Emperors huddling, and the Macaronis screaming.  This movie actually gives a map and a point of reference, showing where the Emperor colony is, and nicely stating that the penguins had a two mile trek to the sea (not the 100 miles we always hear about)(but then again, it was springtime in antartica). Nice original footage of penguins heading out, coming back, and lots of cute young'uns milling about. The de rigeur leopard seal shots were original, infrequent and in the middle

The science was interesting, but it comes with a point of view. That 'global warming' is threatening the penguins and made one of the ice-shelves 'calfed', spawning a mega-iceberg the size of Jamaica (spoiler alert) that eventually drifted to the ice edge by the colony, completely cutting off the emperors and a group of Adelies. Sad footage of penguins either trapped by the crash or mortally caught in a crevice and ominous voice-over of global warming threatening the penguins, while I prefer a happy ending for penguin movies.",1346716800,,2261,4.75765306122449
8165763,5,B000M2E34U,"I divided this film in 2 parts for my Kindergarten students and they enjoyed it a lot. I sat with them and explained when necessary. Afterwards, they got so involved in the topic that they showed it throughout the different areas of learning and went home sharing what they had learnt. Their parents were amazed! The movie was just part of the other activities planned or child-initiated.",1325894400,,388,4.8059701492537314
8165764,3,B000M2E34U,"The filmography is great as a you can expect of National Geopgraphic. However, special effcts as fast forwarding and slow motion are generally unnecessary in nature films. The spoken voice is highly irritating and overly dramatic. Yet, the overall information provided is good. The documentary ends on a realistic, but, unfortunately, depression note.",1233360000,2,351,5.6415094339622645
8165765,5,B000M2E34U,I used this in my college class and gave a writing assignment based on it.  Students were enthusiastic.  The photography is incredible.,1196985600,4,135,5.090909090909091
8165766,5,B000M2E34U,This is an excellent DVD to educate anyone on a beautiful place with beautiful creatures that we would otherwise not be exposed to.,1176163200,5,131,4.739130434782608
