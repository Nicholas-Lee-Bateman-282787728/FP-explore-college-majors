This film begins in a Music Hall with an act for ""Mr. Memory"" who takes questions from the audience and gives the correct answers. A fight breaks out at the bar. Shots are fired and the crowd runs out. A lady asks Richard Hannay to take her home. She seems to be fleeing and afraid; she fired the shots to cause a diversion. Annabelle knows of a plot to steal vital military secrets from England. The next morning Annabelle has been stabbed and dies after warning Hannay! Those men will stop at nothing. She leaves a clue about a man in Scotland. Now Hannay makes his escape to Scotland. The dead body is discovered and Hannay is wanted by the police.

On the train Hannay tries to escape the police, who seem to know of his escape to Scotland. He starts walking to his destination, and stops at a farm house. The police arrive, but Hannay escapes again to eventually arrive at the Professor's mansion. Out of the frying pan and into the fire? But Hannay escapes again, and melds into a crowd. There is an amusing scene where he is mistake for a guest speaker. His platitudes are met with cheers. Then two detectives arrest him and take him back. But there is another escape in the dark night. But now Hannay has a companion; she learns the truth.

The lady goes to tell Scotland Yard about the theft of a military secret, but they don't believe her. They know of her connection to Hannay. When ""Mr. Memory"" tells what the ""39 Steps"" mean he is shot with scenes recalling Lincoln's assassination. The police capture the spies and save the military secret. Since WW I secrets have been photographed on microfilm for speed and accuracy; this memory trick is just a literary invention. This story came from one of the many novels of John Buchan, who was popular in the 1920s-1930s. Another writer was E. Phillip Oppenheim. Both dealt with foreign intrigue and espionage in their suspense novels. Alfred Hitchcock's very popular ""North by Northwest"" was another version of this story.
The original novel is much better than this film.",1412640000,,2055,4.609289617486339
8259666,2,B0015RPKUC,"I've seen Hichcocks's ""The 39 Steps"" several times in theatres and an on TV. This has got to be one of the worst transfers of a classic movie that I've come across. I'm not a neophyte on this. I've got well over 700 films on tape and dvd. The sound is muddy, the images are soft in some areas and Synergy Entertainment keeps putting its name on the lower corner of the screen. Is this a 5th generation copy? I made the mistake of falling for the low price. You get what you pay for.",1247356800,,482,4.08421052631579
