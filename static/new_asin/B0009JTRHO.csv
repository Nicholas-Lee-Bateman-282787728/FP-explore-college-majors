8062125,5,B0009JTRHO,"Here we have all the ingredients of Corman 70s drive in exploitation cult classic at it's finest. Made in a time before a lot of fast moving images and cuts weren't effected by stuttery streaming playback and blocky compression. Where can you go wrong for starters with a cast like this?
Susan Howard ('Dallas'), Claudia Jennings (""Gator Bait""), and Maureen McCormick ('The Brady Bunch') play the Hammer sisters, whose moonshiner father (Fred Foresman) is killed by goons representing a big time sleazy criminal (William Conrad, 'Jake and the Fatman'). The gals are as tough and sassy as they are sexy, and prove to be formidable adversaries, especially when they team up with J.B. Johnson (John Saxon), a racing enthusiast and ace delivery man.
""Moonshine County Express"" doesn't set out to reinvent the wheel, and shows that movies of this ilk do deliver the goods by scrupulously following a formula. The vehicular action is first rate, there are mild doses of sex (there's a hilarious ""fishing"" scene), and the movie is violent without ever getting particularly gory. It's all played with humour and panache, thanks to screenwriters Hugh Smith & Daniel Ansley, and director Gus Trikonis (""Nashville Girl"", ""The Evil""). What truly brings it to life is the work of a colourful and interesting cast. Saxon is an amiable hero (if maybe a tad too old for his role), Howard a strong and independent minded heroine, and Conrad is an effective bad guy. He's somewhat blustery, but Conrad never makes him a one-dimensional cartoon. Morgan Woodward (""Cool Hand Luke"") is also a good villain, playing Conrads' primary thug. If you're a fan of Jennings, be aware that she doesn't get that much to do. McCormick is cute as the youngest of the gals. The cast is rounded out by other familiar faces like Jeff Corey (""In Cold Blood""), Dub Taylor (""The Wild Bunch""), Albert Salmi (""Empire of the Ants""), Len Lesser ('Seinfeld'), the lovely Candice Rialson (""Hollywood Boulevard"") as a town floozy, and E.J. Andre (""Magic"").

Set to an irresistible bluegrass music score by Fred Werner, and shot by legendary B movie D.P. Gary Graver, this is a fun example of its genre, guaranteed to leave you with a smile on your face.",1523059200,,2207,4.932795698924731
8062126,4,B0009JTRHO,"They had me at John Saxon, but add Maureen McCormick and William Conrad...I've little else to say.
The last scene of the film really ties it all together. I won't spoil it for you, but it has to be said that it could not have been more obvious that the entire film took place IN California!",1522540800,,290,4.196428571428571
8062127,5,B0009JTRHO,1976; 16:9; monaural  (Since it presented in monaural I didn't do a reload expecting 5.1)  That is a combination that is rare. I read several reviews; that urged me to watch this. I rarely read reviews The cover picture discouraged me the first time. I'm an alcoholic but all the alcohol this didn't bother me. The action and violence is good for my taste. The pursuit scenes are very good. There is plenty of shooting.,1521417600,,419,4.573333333333333
8062128,3,B0009JTRHO,"a good 70's regional b movie.  weak script on the whole good acting given the script -- the actors themselves have done very good work elsewhere

it was good to see marcia brady again

sadly, there are no scenes in the movie which match the poster shown, where the girls run around in overalls and no tops",1521158400,,305,4.315789473684211

8062132,5,B0009JTRHO,"Moonshine County Express is a wonderful movie about moonshine liquor. It was made in Grass Valley California, my home town. It was great to see sites around town. Three business, National Hot el, Northridge restaurant and The bargain barn were shown in the film. These businesses are still going strong 36 years later. A must see movie for all.",1345420800,5,344,4.8474576271186445
