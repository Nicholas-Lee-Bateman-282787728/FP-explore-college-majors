A Robert Elkins flick.

from WWMM & American Eyesore.

So,This is a really well made tribute,We shall call it to all those 70s drive inn movies.

The girls are cute and embrace multiple stereotypes we always like to see in our  Comfort Food movies  The smart one,the dumb one,the blond one,the scared one and the McGiver one that uses a PENCIL to defeat hordes,Yes hordes of zombies that move Very Fast !

The boys are also represented by a couple stereo-types we have expected,The smart one,the flirt and then their is the TONY JONES turn,A professor ( No,not like Indiana Jones or even the one from Gilligans Islandfinally a Island reference).

This professor carries a flask ,halliburton briefcase with what must be important things and a pipe and any wayHe is a bad man.( period)

We left out some cool nods to Shock Waves and Paul Blaisdell tribute,That was so awesome.",1410912000,4,929,4.7924528301886795

8668782,5,B00LXDQ872,"Do you like cheese with your death? If so, you came to the right place! Zombie Isle is a tongue in cheek romp through the gory world of zombies... all wrapped up with a neat little plot!

A low budget film (with all the bad film cuts and color), that makes you relive the classic B movie 60's and 70's zombie flicks. You have the tropes and stereotypes, college kids, lecherous professor, mad scientist, dumb chick, clever chick, and a selection of fun fodder... and they all find a restricted government island on which to do their research for a school project. But this movie adds more, giving you an actual backstory and history, with the cheesy, not quite over the top, twisted point of view of the zombie society, character motivation, and more.

If you only like high budget blockbusters, move along. If you have a quirky sense of humor, a nostalgic side that loves classic cheesy movies, or just want a great flick to watch over drinks with friends... welcome to the perfect film, Zombie Isle is for you!",1433548800,2,1012,4.585635359116022
8668783,3,B00LXDQ872,"The story takes on a pretty basic concept- people enter unknown territory and come face-to-face with the reanimated dead. There is some depth added by the addition of a mad scientist from the Nazi regime that causes the horror in order to harness the power over life and death in the name of the Nazi party. The characters, although two dimensional, seem grounded with some realism, a bit of satire which make it easy to connect with them. The acting is a bit cheesy, but it is intentional. This is an homage to the low budget, poorly acted and much loved cult films of the past. Zombie Isle is every bit that and Robert Elkins does a d@mn good job at creating it both in story and visual effects.

The special effects used in Zombie Isle are stripped-down practical ones that at times manage to capture the same classic aspects of films like Zombi, Dawn Of The Mummy and Zombie Island Massacre. The zombies are simple, effective creatures that really sell the films overall intention to create a gory film on a low budget. There are moments when the effects are flubbed, mostly by showing the practical effect technique or aspect to clearly, giving away the illusion, but for the most part things work. The color effect and 70s retro effect can be a bit distracting, but the sound effects dissolve any annoyance and really set things right- both atmospherically and suspenseful.

Overall I really enjoyed Zombie Isle. At first I just knew I was not going to like this film, that the vision and ability for Elkins to execute it would not mesh. I was pleasantly surprised. What really makes this film enjoyable is the zombie make-up style and creative use of simple practical effects. Plus Elkins doesnt weigh the film down with a bunch of back story or added dialog. Everything is stripped down, and for the most part effective. There is some moments with the scientist that feels contrived and the ability to control mindless zombies without voodoo is questionable, but for the most part Zombie Isle gives us a a fun, entertaining, film.",1431475200,3,2038,4.705882352941177
8668784,4,B00LXDQ872,"Typical 'B' Zombie movie.  It's no WWZ, but about as good as any intestine pull or bone chewer you might see.  As expected, shallow characters, transparent setup story plots, and lots of neck bites skin pulls and mobile dead.",1424649600,3,225,4.743589743589744
8668785,3,B00LXDQ872,"This is a faux-70's drive-in movie film spoof that was well done in some spots and over cooked in others. Professor Grant Foster (Tony Jones) who doesn't wear Foster Grants leads a group of students on a field trip to study the wildlife on an isolated island. They find an army experiment, an old Nazi, and zombies...and I am not sure what that three headed thing was.

The film was made to look like a bad transfer by design. It capture much of the 70's style including the overuse of blue eye shadow, turtlenecks, and music. The one eyed man with a hook steering the boat was a nice campy touch. About halfway through the film, the campy effect got old and the film died off when it should have picked up. For instance, Laurie (Apryl Crowell) starts to come across like Buffy, the Zombie Slayer, but then they stop that development. She quickly became my favorite character with the pencil scene, but they failed to develop the other characters as smartly.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity that I saw. I am not sure what film the person who wrote the advisory guide on the back viewed. One girl removes her top and we see her bra and barb wire tattoos which I didn't think was vogue in 1978.",1418688000,3,1195,4.427272727272728

The distributor should be ashamed for releasing this. The story was jumbled, the acting non-existent and the dialogue worse; but I watched it to the end. It was worth about $1.00. For those people who, like me, watch this genre, it is typical of the lowest budget. Although the movie might be worth watching in pristine condition, this version is not.",1414368000,7,528,4.627659574468085

Somewhen in the 1970's: Professor Foster (Tony Jones) and a group of students go on a field trip to an uncharted island, mainly because no man has (supposedly) set foot on it for 30 years and thus it's supposed to show plants and wildlife in its natural habitat. However, the professor isn't half as interested in plants and wildlife as he is in his cute honour student Amie (Kyle Billeter), so he has his students split up into groups of two, making sure that she'll become his companion. Problem is of course, of all the students he has taken with him, Amie is the only one who actually is interested into plants and wildlife, while he seems to be unable to stop making an utter fool out of himself.
There is a bigger problem looming as well of course, this being that the island is populated by zombies of the flesh-eating variety ... and soon, the professor's group is down to him (who takes an awful long time to grasp what's going on), Amie, and airheads Laurie (Apryl Crowell) and Heatler (Crystal Howell). Somehow they evade the zombies, but when they put up camp for the night and the professor's supposed to be on watch, he has a quick laydown, and the next day they find Amie has been abducted.
The next day, the professor and the girls meet Dr Von Wolff (David S. Witt), who seems to be a rather civilized person, and what's more, he has found a serum to keep the zombies in check, and they accept his hospitality subsequently. Turns out the zombies are the results of a failed army experiment, and Von Wolff was the last scientist left behind to take care of them - which he was perfectly able to as long as there were no unexpected visitors ... so the professor's students were really just bad luck.
What Von Wolff fails to tell though is that he keeps Amie in his basement for some experiments, that he had been conducting human experiments for the Nazis before relocating to the USA, and that he doesn't just keep his zombies ""in check"" but has some ulterior motives for them ... and of course, that the tea he has just served his guests is actually drugged ...

Zombie Isle is 1970's zombie cinema all over again, and not just thanks to the right costumes and backdrops, and the washed out, grainy and splices look of the film as such, but also thanks to its very basic story, invariably practical effects work, unapologetic gruesomeness, lack of political correctness and the like. And even if the tongue is firmly in cheek in Zombie Isle, it stays away from ever becoming just moronic but remains a loving (if ironic) homage throughout. So fans of of vintage grindhouse cinema will probably find a lot to like about this movie, and at the same time it's almost certain to work as a mindless party movie - and it's gruesome enough to appeal to the zombie enthusiast as well ... and basically, it's just fun!!!
