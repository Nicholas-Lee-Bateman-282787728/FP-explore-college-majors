They went to the same orphanage where she left her own baby and picked him up for adoption. Couple of years later she becomes pregnant and delivers another baby boy (Hassan Yusuf). The father clearly discriminated between the two brothers and always loved his own son more than the adopted one. Even when the older son fell in love with a girl (Nadia Lutfi) while in college, the father refused his adopted son to marry the girl and he preferred to marry her to his own son (Hassan Yusuf). The girl was a daughter of a man who was a childhood friend with Imad Hamdi. The two fathers arranged that Imad Hamdis son to marry the daughter (Nadia Lutfi). The girl (Nadia Lutfi), knew from her father (who was a childhood friend with her lover's father) that he is an adopted son. The younger son refuses the idea of marrying his brothers lover. Abdel Halim, the older son faces his father cruelty towards him and tells him how bad he always felt because he never felt his fathers true love. While arguing in a challenging way, the father slaps the adopted son Abdel Halim and kicks him out of the house while the mother and son are watching and listening. Abdel Halim challenged the father that he will stay with his mother and brother. The father tells him that neither one is blood related to him nor he can stay in his house.

She never replies. He leaves the house and works in a factory as an engineer. He almost died in an accident while day dreaming on the job.

The search for Abdel Halim starts and they found him and beg him to return home and he refuses. Finally the mother faces him with reality and brings with her the birth certificate to show him that she is the real mother and she tells him the story when and how she became pregnant. He then asked her why you did not reply when I asked you if you were my mother? She said If I did, your angry father could have killed me. Finally it was a happy ending.
It is different when you watch the movie instead of reading couple of paragraphs about it. I did my best to summarize it that you can enjoy it as much as I did.
The movie was done in 1962 and the producer was legendary Hassan Al Imam.",1382486400,,3289,4.289389067524116
