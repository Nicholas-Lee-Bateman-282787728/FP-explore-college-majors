8443983,4,B004VSKEIK,"Got this at a Dollar Tree, as well as a pack of normal playing cards. The DVD has some good tricks that may appear cheesy (selected card is the only one flipped over in the deck; Mentalism to find your selected card; etc.) but if you can put performance behind the act they're pretty effective.
Also some good money tricks.
Overall, if you're new to magic like I am, this is a great little starting DVD for some basic card tricks. Easy to learn and pretty fun to do.",1316995200,2,466,4.247191011235955
