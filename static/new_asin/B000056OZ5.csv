1399032,4,B000056OZ5,"This dvd was the first one I bought. It shows the vast lands of the serengeti in the most beautiful colors. You learn a lot about the animals and the nature. However, I wasn't very impressed of the picture quality. You notice that this is a DVD from the early days and it is even an old IMAX movie. But the overall impression is really positive.",992131200,2,345,4.242424242424242

I ordered a  replacement for myself, only to find that it is out of print. This is a  tragedy. This disk is far superior in all respects to the several othe Imax  DVDs I own.
I hope that they get it back in print soon.",947462400,10,492,4.09375

1399168,5,B000056OZ5,"When I was young, this was one of my favorite nature documentaries to watch.

The visuals are still unrivaled, capturing the full scope, magnificence, brutality, and scale of some of the biggest, most ferocious land migrations on earth.

James Earl Jones lends his terrific voice in a great narration, and the score, filled with African drums and chanting, will set the blood pumping!

1399183,4,B000056OZ5,"I would not normally rate a video that's 15 years old, but having just read a review wherein the diatribe suggests that a creation of a decade and a half back should live up to today's best resolution is more than one should possibly expect. Another comment suggests that the narration was poor; on the contrary - James Earl Jones is among the planet's best narrators alive today. Having spent time touring and filming the Serengeti, I can attest to the fact that this work is very well done. The only reason for rating this as a 4, rather than a 5, is the fact that the technology in filming has now advanced by several years.",1294185600,,627,4.413793103448276
1399184,5,B000056OZ5,"I spend a long vacation in Africa from Cape Town to Kenya..and this DVD chronicalled my trip in Tanzania and Kenya! I was delighted. I was thrilled with the migration pictures (unlike one reviewer) because it looked like the same place I saw the migration for real! I think it is leopards not cheetahs that put their food in trees...never the less, I can't agree with the viewer that gave this DVD only 3 stars since I have been in the areas and seen the places and animals in the DVD. I loved it and would recommend it highly to anyone interested in Kenya and Tanzania animals and country. I can't remember if Leopards were shown in this DVD.

The Crocks don't really have to kill the Wildebeests migrating because the river is full of dead animals that don't make it. The smell along the river is pungent as birds and Crocks  feed on the dead.",1287792000,,845,4.410256410256411

1399186,4,B000056OZ5,"I bought this for Christmas and we thoroughly enjoyed watching the beautiful scenery.  James Earl Jones is not the best to narrate these, however, since it can be difficult to understand his very deep voice.  Otherwise, great.",1262649600,,226,5.081081081081081

1399190,5,B000056OZ5,"I watched this movie right before booking a trip to the Serengeti. This film confirmed my decision to go there for a summer holiday. The blu-ray quality is wonderful, and the film covers the Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, the Masai Mara, and Lake Nakuru. It'll give you a great idea of the wonders of East Africa.",1244937600,,312,4.6909090909090905
1399191,3,B000056OZ5,"The good first; this has amazing image and sound quality. At first production values seem high, and the camerwork is pretty good.

But, there are some sloppy mistakes both in the documentary and in the supplemental stuff; the documentary states that adult elephants have no predators, when in fact lion pride do sometimes take them down (the Planet Earth series documents this).
Also, as far as the subtitles go...did they proof those at all? There seems to be a typo every other line, at least.  This was the case on the other IMAX films I bought too, so I imagine it's something they have consistent problems with.  Words were missing, misspelled, mangled...for a person with so/so hearing it was a real PITA. There also weren't really any extras if that sort of thing is important to (it's not to me, but fair warning).

Also, the documentary itself was pretty shallow.  It was just another wildebeest/lion/crocodile/elephant show; there's so much more the Serengeti than the wildebeest migration and the elephants.  It's a huge tract of land, with diverse wildlife, but watching this you'd think it was all those four species.  Sort of a letdown really.",1243728000,3,1157,4.93298969072165
1399192,3,B000056OZ5,"Not bad, but the video quality is disappointing by 2009 standards.  Some of the scenes are OK, but most are not up to Blu-Ray quality.  Also, it is a bit heavy on wildebeasts and light on other animals.  Overall, worth a look, as long as you are not expecting state of the art video quality.",1240790400,3,291,4.254545454545455

1399206,1,B000056OZ5,"If you own BBC Planet Earth in Blu-Ray and purchase this, YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY. First the quality is not good when you compare it to Planet Earth. Yes, it's better than DVD but the shooting, dynamic range, and image quality is just bad (not to mention the poor transfer/encoding). This would have been amazing 10 years ago but not by Blu-Ray standards today. You even see dust particles show up in some frames and some are huge. There is no reason for this at all in this day and age. I have no idea why people are rating this so high.

The second biggest problem that I have is the narration and quality of the content. It's childish, boring and almost pointless. ""Look at the pretty lions. Now look at this animal, it lives here too."". Please. Again, if you have seen the BBC's documentaries, then this is just below average. Not horrible or pure garbage but simply worth $4.99 in my books. And no, I am not from the UK.

One last thing. Blu-ray has three codecs people can use. One thing that baffles me with this video is why on Earth they used MPEG2 (older, slower) instead of VC1 or AVC and why didn't they do some kind of re-processing to adjust the colors and provide more dynamic range in many scenes??? Yes, the MPEG2 is at 1080p but why?? In some scenes you can see the good old ""I don't have enough colors to display this scene Moire pattern"" you get with several DVD movies. I have a Pioneer Elite and this thing looked bad. And no, I am not an audiophile or video enthusiast. I just got very mad when I saw this. I was shocked given the price, ratings and the fact that this is a Blu-Ray disc. It took me off guard completely. There are many other videos from this company that are just as bad. The re-production is horrible. At least if that had been good then I could have gotten a bit of eye candy. Nothing.

If you do not believe me, buy it and watch Planet Earth or Galapagos right after in Blu-Ray. Day and night. If you argue it's because the movie is older, fine, no problem but buyer beware. I never would have purchased this had I seen the video. It's not total crap but it's a boring slightly better than DVD video with poor narration and so-so cinematography which probably looked really good when it came out. In 2008, it's a disappointment.",1228435200,32,2270,4.323943661971831

The title of this review is what the narrator says at the beginning and end of this fantastic documentary (first shown in IMAX theatres) that profiles a place where the equation of life is as follows:

(1) Herbivores eat plants.
(2) Carnivores eat herbivores.

The place profiled is the Serengeti, a huge area of grassland in Tanzania, East Africa.  The narrator is Darth Vader himself, James Earl Jones, whose voice adds another dimension to this mesmerizing and revealing film.

Here's a sampling of what you will see:

(1) The Great Migration (a sight few have seen and considered a great wonder of the world)
(2) ""One of the natural wonders of the world""
(3) One of the ""most famous archaeological sites on Earth""
(4) A sampling of millions of diverse creatures found here including the ""horses of Africa""
(5) The proud people who live here
(6) Miracles of the Serengeti

My knowledge of the Serengeti before viewing this film was...nothing.  I found this film a great and exciting way to be introduced to this important region of the world.  You couldn't ask for better cinematography and photography.

I found the background music throughout to be interesting and unique.

What I especially liked was that the narrator did not attempt to overwhelm me with too many details.  I got the impression that only the most important and interesting information was carefully selected and presented.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has no extras.

In conclusion, there is indeed a place on this planet where it is still the morning of life and the great herds run free.  This place has been captured for all to see in this extraordinary film!!

1399211,3,B000056OZ5,"This is not a comment on video quality nor producer's skill. Just a warning. Often folks buy animal stories - and now videos - for young kids. Indeed, one great naturalist recently bemoaned that in a test of identification, most young children cannot identify real animals - only the cartoons. This kind of video would seem like a natural remedy.

But somehow the psyche of the producer is fixed on the 'cycle of life' (translation: one animal ripping another animal's throat out). We have to make a distinction between real educational value (How much land does a carnivore require? What is the ecology mix here? What weather or land qualities are at play?) vs. an animal snuff movie.

I am not sure this video has made that leap of insight.

Not for tots.",1219536000,3,757,4.676691729323308

1399225,3,B000056OZ5,"It was interesting enough and James Earl did a nice job with the commentary but it falls short of any of the amazing ""planet earth"" series.  I have a 42in LCD TV with a PS3 that plays blue ray and the picture on the planet earth series is top of the line.  The Imax DVD, its good but nothing great. It was good documentary, but was probably made for the IMAX theatre not your house TV and it showed a little.  I bought the entire Planet earth series but if you don't want to make such an investment just buy the first disc which includes 1 of 3 in the series of 11 documentarys. I was simply blown away by ""Pole to Pole"" on the 1st disc.  Look at it and see for yourself, this is one nature show you will watch over and over...I still cant get over how crazy the picture was.

Go watch the Imax film for the little 12 bucks you're gonna pay for it on this site, but I would put my money on the planet earths series. If you don't have HD or an HD/Blueray DVD player than I wouldnt worry about what I said because the picture difference won't be noticeable and either film will do.",1201737600,,1079,4.046948356807512

1399229,5,B000056OZ5,"How could you go wrong with James Earl Jones doing the narration?  I have the standard version of this disc.  It was one of the earliest to transfer to dvd.  It came in a cd size case (eventually the size of the case was enlarged to prevent confusion with cds).  Having both versions made it possible to do a comparison.  What a difference the high definition (Blue Ray) version makes.  It's like night and day.  The HD version is much sharper, clearer and colorful, just what you would expect from the new HD format.  I wanted to toss the sd version in the trash but I'll keep it to show folks the difference between HD  and SD movies.

The sd version had so much LFE (bass) that I had to turn the sub down quite a bit.  In fact, it has too much LFE.  The Blue Ray disc has a much appreciated toned down version.  As far as the movie goes, it does an excellent job of showing the great migration of animals in Africa.  I am a big fan of ""nature documentaries."" and this is one of the best.  It is not too long or too short but when I get into a good documentary such as this, I always wish it wouldn't end.",1197072000,18,1107,4.083720930232558

The IMAX experience sadly lacking.

Even the scenery is sorta bland.  Lots of savanna land, and aerial shots of savanna land, and animals running on savanna land.  Animals mating, and eating one another in the savanna. Rivers flowing through savanna land.  The director also goes a bit overboard with the fish-eye lens on the camera.

Perhaps the film is mis-titled?  How about, ''Gnu's of the Savanna?""

National Geographic puts this one to shame.",1193443200,2,489,4.950617283950617

1399253,3,B000056OZ5,"This movie is ok for a documentary.  It is meant to show life on the serenghiti and has James Earl Jones narrating.  However, this movie showcases, primarily, the great, annual Wildebeast migratation.  I know how important this migration is to all life on the African plains, but come on!  It spends only about 5 minutes, randomly, on other animals.  What about the display of male African elephants during breeding season?  Or Jaguars carting food in trees to hide from other predators?  How about the structured but seemingly chaotic feeding of Crocs?  Nope, wildebeast dominate this movie.  If you want a movie on migration, this is it.

1399257,5,B000056OZ5,"This documentary of the vast Serengeti which spans from Tanzania to Kenya is a visual feast, and follows the incredible migration of the million wildebeest and several thousand zebra that journey from the dust of the southern drought to the vegetation in the northern regions. Along the way they pass by many predators, with some of the herd falling prey to them. We also see many diverse species of the area, among them a baboon community, the majestic beauty of a herd of elephants, and many scenes of maternal love that are endearing, even with the ungainly and massive black rhino.

We see a hungry cheetah dash after a gazelle, the lions at play and as rulers of the plains, visit with the handsome Masai tribe, and view the incredible vistas from a hot air balloon. The most memorable scene in the film is on the wildebeest's return to the south, where they must get across a river flooded by the rain. The crocodiles lie in wait for this event, and many from the herd also perish from exhaustion. The size and scope of this river crossing makes it an image one will never forget. The cinematography by Andrew Kitzanuk is spectacular, and makes this one of the best documentaries I have seen for sheer viewing spectacle on the subject of African wildlife.

Written, directed and produced by George Cassey, the emphasis is on the poetry of the land, rather than a long list of facts and figures. Narrated by James Earl Jones, his sonorous voice is always easy on the ears, as he says things like ""Life streams across a land suspended in time."" Also nice to listen to is the lovely score by Hans Zimmer and George Cadebe, which includes some haunting vocals.
Recommended viewing for any animal and nature enthusiast, the total running time is 39 minutes.",1119744000,47,1758,4.667741935483871
1399258,3,B000056OZ5,"If you are new into wildlife documentaries and films, you would like this DVD and some of its footages. But if you have seen many of the National Geographic wildlife videos and documentaries and Discovery Channel's series called ""Untamed Africa"", which captures all the wildlife drama in the African savanna, this DVD will appear to be a paltry 40 minutes of not even half the excitement. The documentary mainly features the great annual migration of the wilde beest en masse between Kenya and Tanzania to ensure their survival. The footage captures some of the natural dangers that jeopardize this journey in the form of lurking predators like lions, cheetahs and hyenas on land, swift flowing river currents and waiting crocodiles in the river. But the herds brave all these dangers, carrying with them a new promise of life and survival. The DVD does capture  the primeval truths of survival in the wild and has some magnificant footage of African savanna but what could have spiced it up is some  more of those natural drama which  accompanies many inter-species encounters in the African bush and which have been captured in many other documentaries on African wildlife. Three examples I can immediately think of are from National Geographic's documentaries, featuring bitter encounters between lions and hyenas, an experimental approach of a group of young lions towards an isolated baby elephant and one fascinating encounter between a lioness and a wild buffalo in which the lioness narrowly escapes being torn asunder by the buffalo's horns.

wildlife, you may find that IMax's Serengeti leaves a lot to be desired in
terms of story telling, focus on wildlife and scientific knowledge. IMax
movies are shot on larger than normal film to achieve very high resolution
and smoother color transitions which will only be noticable when projected
on giant movie screens. When the film is transferred to DVD and viewed
on your much more inferior and small TV (as compared to projected film),
all of the IMax advantage is totally lost. This goes for all IMax titles.
If you only want to see random scenes from animal life in the Serengeti,
you might like it. Otherwise, first consider the many National Geographic
titles about African wildlife (even on VHS) some of which have won awards.",1003363200,71,808,4.7785714285714285
