2201518,5,B00076SCPW,"My children are dictating this review. This is their favorite of all the existing (in 2018) movies. They love the way the characters relate to each other (far better than 5), and as children, they find it empowering to see small, rather sweet, simple creatures help bring down the empire. The only part they do not like is seeing Leia as a sexual slave. They really hate that. But Leia overall is much better than in 5. In 6,, she has good ideas, is a good fighter, and is much more empowered and smart.",1520726400,,503,4.361702127659575

2201532,5,B00076SCPW,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I live in China (currently) so have been unable to stream the content until now even though I've had the movies in my library for quite a while. No problems with streaming, which for the terrible WiFi service is awesome. I was impressed with the color of the films, especially since as a child I went through three VHS copies of the movies before they'd even announced there was to be a second trilogy.

One thing that struck me though; why was David Prowse swapped for Hayden Christensen at the end of Jedi? Was it to interweave the movies more? After all, Anakin turns into energy as Prowse, and they didn't swap Alec Guinness with Ewan McGregor.",1515888000,,679,4.432

2201534,1,B00076SCPW,The movie is the movie ... what I am unhappy with is the quality of the reproduction.  It streams pixelated to the point of distraction especially during the speeder scenes and  any scene in the forest.  It is not HD and I would rate it 240 in some places  with pixels the size of Carrie Fisher's head.  I have seen better quality pirated DVDs out of Thailand than this.  Save your money by the DVD... I hope it is at least VHS quality.  And yes... I want my money back.  $19.99 for this... no thank you. $1.00 for this... no thank you.,1515024000,,536,4.186274509803922

2201545,5,B00076SCPW,"Since Amazon has carelessly mixed all reviews of all editions of the Star Wars Trilogy (Ep. IV, V, VI), confusing many buyers and causing many to pick the wrong Editions as a result, let me start by stating which DVD's and which editions I bought -

I got all three originals of the first true trilogy - Episodes IV, V, VI, all separate in their own cases and each with 2 DVDs inside.

DVD Edition, Enhanced AND Theatrical Editions (2 discs per movie), Full Screen Edition (Also available in widescreen)

*Just a note about the Full Screen edition: The ""Enhanced"" remake version of each movie is indeed in Full Screen but the Original Unaltered/Theatrical Editions on disc 2 (for all 3 movies) is in letterbox only. I had no problem with it, it did not detract or distract while watching and the letterbox aspect ratio has barely more black than the regular modern day Widescreen...So, don't worry about that if you're thinking of getting this. I was so glad to find the REAL movie versions that I would have taken any letterbox size!

Disc 1 - ""Enhanced"" version (re-release with added scenes & changed musical scenes in Mos Eisley, Jabba's Palace, End celebration sequence on Return Of The Jedi, etc...)
Disc 2 with the original unaltered ""Theatrical"" version, which is the original as aired in movie theaters in 1977-1983.

It was so great to FINALLY find the edition of the original trilogy with the option of watching it the proper way without all the added CGI animation and re-done music scenes. I agree with another reviewer here that I, too, absolutely DESPISE the re-make of the musical band scene in Jabba's Palace (Return Of The Jedi). The female singer originally was a puppet and there were men under the floor making her ""dance"" by moving a steel frame and puppet strings. The CGI cheapens the entire scene and the music itself is both awful and extremely aggravating. I remembered the original song ever since I first saw the movies on VHS when I was growing up. What a throwback experience.

The packaging is nice. The front and back covers of the case have the original artwork from the first VHS releases of the films from back in the late 70's/early 80's. There are bonus features included but I don't really care about that stuff; I bought this strictly to have the original unaltered films on demand. The paper inside just has artwork, a chapter/scene list, and a quick description of what commentary & features are included on the discs in addition to the films themselves. Nothing extra on the little paper itself, everything is on the discs. Lucas is a sell-out giving this franchise to Disney; what a mistake. I don't care to watch any of his commentary. There is also a demo of a ridiculous Lego Star Wars game for XBox which I will also never use on my XBox.

These editions were released in September of 2006 and I believe this is the only time they released the originals on DVD so I am glad and lucky to have found them. At approximately $30 apiece, I feel it was a steal to get such a rare hard-to-find edition at such a great price-under $100 for all three films, and two versions each at that.

I highly recommend this particular edition to all Star Wars fans who want the true original experience. For me personally I feel it was best as it was originally shown, with all the physical puppets, original music scenes, and no CGI.",1508889600,,3363,4.6214405360134005
2201546,4,B00076SCPW,The only thing I didn't like? All the added cgi. Really wanted the original experience.,1507939200,,87,4.866666666666666

2201548,5,B00076SCPW,"return of the jedi has always been my 2nd favorite star wars movie (behind empire strikes back)
and for years i suffered through the special edition of rotj as many have.
im not a special edition hater. my main problem was with that awful cgi mess with obnoxious music that replaced the lapti nek scene in jabbas palace.i never had a problem with anything else in the special edition though i didn't care for the plant thing in the sarlac pit either. the problem is that to me at least the special edition hasn't aged well. the changes stand out more and more as time passes. that said the most missed things will hayden christensen and the extra oola scene small price to pay to never hear jedi rocks again.
so on to the real movie. i have a widescreen copy here so i was seeing things i've never seen before. the picture quality was good. i want to say astounding but i might be pushing it. i noticed the rancor and space scenes looked better than i remembered them. i also think the audio is mixed perfectly loud and clear without being imblanced. (you know the type turn the tv up to hear dialogue then the next explosion sends you flying through the window) in closing id say its good to own this dvd and pick it up if you love star wars",1505692800,,1242,4.311965811965812

2201569,3,B00076SCPW,"It was great to see this iconic movie in full instead of just little snippets on the TV, which is what I saw growing up. Jabba the Hutt is a classic character and the beginning area in his palace is definitely a must-watch from Star Wars. The finale is amazing! For those interested in the Jedi, the Sith, and Darth Vaders journey as shown in later Star Warsthis is where it all began. The last moments between Luke and his father brought tears to my eyes, and as a new-generation fan I actually liked the added scenes that tie into the later movies. I don't watch a lot of movies from this era and the 80s style isn't for me visually. But its a good movie.",1494979200,,657,4.222222222222222

2201578,4,B00076SCPW,"I'm not quite sure why the producers felt it was necessary to dumb down and cute up this final episode of the trilogy.  I will agree that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a downer on so many levels but it created the entire mythology surrounding ""Star Wars"" and established the films as intelligent, well-acted and tragic - something the Academy Awards refused to see because it was sci-fi but, all things told, do the Oscars really judge quality?  When you exempt an entire genre, there's something wrong with the Academy.  Anyway, we have in ""Return of the Jedi"" something akin to a redaction of much of ""Empire"".  The opening scene with Jabba is made unduly long with the addition of footage previously cut.  It makes the escape sequence much more comical which, in itself, is not bad since ""Star Wars"" does have a tradition of humorous moments but it undercuts Luke who, by this time, has the power to do whatever he really wants.  And then there are the Ewoks.  Cute as a button when I saw this film first in the theaters at age five but irritating and, at the base of it, again entirely at Luke's whim.  Had the Rebels landed on a planet with more rational and skeptical alien life forms, it would have made for a tenser and more challenging situation.  All this aside, the tension is there - when are they going to destroy the shield?  When is the Emperor going to succeed in enslaving Luke to his ends?  And what can Luke's sister do?  These underlying questions, and others surely, help to create the action and suspense that were so critical to the other ""Star Wars"" episodes.  In the end, this is still a classic but I don't believe it's unreasonable to have asked for more.",1492819200,,1681,4.526490066225166

2201581,3,B00076SCPW,"This movie is the weakest of the original trilogy.  The plan to free Han Solo from Jabba the Hut was absurd, and the gorilla war tactics use by the Ewoks against the Empire troopers were ridiculous.

Watched my favorite Movie of All time Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi which in My opinion The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Mark Hamill(Britannia Hospital) as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford(Blade Runner) as Han Solo ,Carrie Fisher(The Blues Brothers) as Leia Organa, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca, Jermey Bulloch(George & Mildred) as Boba Fett, Billy Dee Williams(Colt .45 ) as Lando Calrrission, Anthony Daniels (Bashki's Lord Of The Rings) as C- 3PO, Kenny Baker(Flash Gordon) as R2-D2 Denis Lawson(Bitter Cherry) as Wedge Antilles, Dermot Crowley(Giro Ciy) as General Madine , Caroline Blakiston(Les Miserables) as Mon Mothma, Tim Rose(Just William) & Erik Bauersfield as Admiral Ackbar, Michael Pennington(Cymbeline) as Moff Jerjerrod ,Kenneth Colley (Firefox) as Admiral Piett ,Frank Oz(The Muppet Movie) as Yoda, , David Prowse(Doctor Who) & James Earl Jones(Conan The Barbarian) as Darth Vader ,Ian McDiarmid(A Performance Of Macbeth) as Emporer Palpatine/Darth Sidious and Sir Alec Guinness(The Bridge On The River Kwai) as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi,. The Film is Great has one of the best intros as Vader's Shuttle Approaches The Death Star II. The Film is the best out of the Star Wars Saga with The High Octane Action Adventure and Compelling Characters with a brilliant Story and fantastic visuals and the best Emotional Conflict Between Vader,Luke Skywalker and The Emporer as well as The Rebel Alliances Final Assault on The Death Star II , Fantastic Cinematography by Alan Hume(Eye Of The Needle), Production Design By Norman Reynolds(Phase IV) ,Amazing Writing By Lawrence Kasdan(The Big Chill) ,Direction By Richard Marquand(The Legacy), Fantastic Costume design from Aggie Guerard Rodgers(American Graffiti) & Nilos Rodis-Jamero and Amazing Score from John Williams(Indiana Jones and The Raiders Of The Lost Ark) definitely one of my favorite movies ever 10/10",1491523200,,1930,5.498316498316498

2201628,4,B00076SCPW,"""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is the third film from the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the sixth in terms of chronology. It was made 6 years after the original and was the first that did not win any Oscars, but still scored 4 nominations. Fans of the possibly biggest franchise in film history often consider this one the weakest from the 3 early films, but I cannot agree with this sentiment. It may even be my favorite from the trio. They included many interesting new characters, elaborated nicely on the old ones and there is one of the most famous villains in film history in here. The locations are fairly great to watch as well.

The film is pretty long, runs for roughly 135 minutes, but there was rarely a moment when I felt it dragged and to me it also seemed as if most of the actors have stepped up their games by 1983. George Lucas only appears as writer in here and the director is Richard Marquand, probably not a name to too many outside the Star Wars universe. Unlucky for him, he also died way too early. But I think he did a fairly memorable job here. What I liked the most about his film here are probably all the colorful, memorable characters, especially the cute furry ones.

But the film also delivers on the dramatic side, especially in terms of Yoda and in terms of tragedy involving core characters. And for the great sci-fi lovers, there are also many great locations in space and spectacular special effects sequences.",1484179200,,1458,4.477443609022556

2201633,4,B00076SCPW,"I didn't understand this movie. It starts off in such a manner that I feel there should have been a movie or two before it, so people could have some kind of backstory to the characters. Maybe even three movies before those two. And maybe three more after this one. Possibly, a lifetime of side narratives would be helpful too. Maybe two computer animated series would also aid in fleshing out this stand alone sci-fi movie, as well a cartoon in the 80's about the friendly teddy bears in this one. Just some ideas.",1484006400,,515,4.48936170212766
2201634,5,B00076SCPW,A classic. I really enjoyed the little ewoks... cute little teddy bears. The flying through the forest on those motor bikes was the best scene of any action film I've ever seen. EPIC!!!,1483920000,,185,4.636363636363637

2201638,3,B00076SCPW,"We bought the digital version. The quality seems to be pretty good. Disappointed in some of the changes--most notably, the ending music during the celebration on the Moon of Endor. The music (obviously) just doesn't quite fit the scene the way the old one did, and it's not as joyous. There are other additions, such as Darth Vader yelling, ""NOOO!"" as he throws the Emperor over the edge of the railing. It also shows celebrations on other planets, which is fine. The spirit of Darth Vader at the end is changed to match the newer movies. I don't really mind the additions as much as the flat out changes, such as the music at the end. It just left the movie feeling a little off.",1483660800,,680,4.448
2201639,5,B00076SCPW,Love the movie today. And I really liked it as a kid. Luke Skywalker you go.,1483574400,,76,3.8125
2201640,4,B00076SCPW,"While Return of the Jedi is not a perfect film, it has many joys, and some subtle moments. Our dear Carrie Fisher has many great moments, and not only when she delivers justice to that blobby Jabba. When she frees Han from the carbonite block, and he asks who it is, she removes the mask and says ""someone who loves you."" It's a brilliant reveal. The whole adventure at Jabba the Hut's castle is a hoot, and when Jedi Luke says to Jabba ""it's the last mistake you'll ever make,"" the film pays off with a great riff on pirate ""walk the plank"" tropes. The three-way face off between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor (a stellar Ian McDiarmid, also brilliant in the Prequel Trilogy) is full of stern tension and shifting alliances.

As everyone notes, most of the soft mush takes place on the Endor moon, and yeah, the Ewoks were better in concept than execution. Still, there are some bright moments on the moon as well: the speeder chases through the forest, C3PO telling the story of the first two films around the campfire, Chewie commandeering the walker. I had wished that the third episode had more of a triumphal feel, but it's still very enjoyable on it's own terms, and there's some great filmmaking to be had.",1483401600,,1212,4.534246575342466

Aside from feeling placed in the action sequences, the creation of Jabba the Hutt feels deep and dingy like his palace, and the Ewoks create a fun tribe feel that relies on strategy instead of technology to overthrow the empire. But don't get me wrong: the dialogue is still rather weak, and Carrie Fisher's acting ability can't make up for that famous slave bikini she's now known for.",1481587200,,520,4.725274725274725

The steel book blue ray does NOT have the original version as a bonus disc as an older review of a DVD is said to have. This package only has audio commentary as a special feature, NO OTHER FEATURES. The picture quality is nothing to write home about, I can't imagine it's any better than the DVD because it's still kind of blurry. So it was bad enough they changed some of the important scenes when they re-released this back in the 90's, but on this blue ray, we get an added Vader scream of ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" when he throws the emperor to his death. Why do that? God only knows. So if that ""NOOOOOOOOOO"" might ruin one of your favorite scenes, just buy the DVD, because I want to return this ASAP.

Darth Vader grows from an innocent child, Anikin, to a dark lord. In IV a new hope arises in Luke Skywalker. He must learn to be a Jedi. In V his friends are endangered as he attempts to confront his father. VI Luke comes back to help his friends and challenge his father and the Sith Lord. Star Wars, takes us through the evolution of the crisis and the frustration of those who, by trying to stop it, actually help the dark lord in his efforts to take over the republic. We watch as Anikin is manipulated by the Sith Lord and turns to evil Darth Vader.

2201768,2,B00076SCPW,"Return of the Jedi is a sci-fi tale about an evil empire constructing a second space station that functions as a weapon of mass destruction, and the empire's despots seek to join forces with a powerful warrior called a Jedi who will make the empire even stronger.  Meanwhile, a pair of good robots initiate a plan to rescue a comrade from a gangster who is in league with the evil empire.  However, the robots become captured by the gangster and they must wait to learn if the Jedi warrior will come to their aid.

Notably, Return of the Jedi is the film that marks when the Star Wars series runs out of new story ideas.  The movie has characters regress with their past personalities and abilities, adds in comedic elements that are juvenile, and has George Lucas returning to write the screenplay instead of having a good science fiction author write the film as what occurred for The Empire Strikes Back which is the best film of the series---Leigh Brackett, who was a famous science fiction author, wrote the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back which people may read by typing ""Leigh Brackett Empire Strikes Back script PDF"" into a search-engine.  This last fact about the absence of a good science fiction author writing the script is clearly what causes Return of the Jedi to be a poor film.

More specifically, the following events in Return of the Jedi reveal why it is a mediocre movie.  A space station functioning as weapon of mass destruction once again is attacked by rebels who oppose the empire, just like in the first Star Wars film---nothing new nor unique about this idea.  The gangster's entourage members are portrayed in a cute manner which causes one to wonder: why is the gangster feared when his henchmen are simpletons?  The robots' representation of physical comedy increases from past films which originally portrayed the robots with a sense of humor but not performing physical comedy because the robots originally functioned to represent the life of slaves or manual laborers, and that life is not funny.
A beloved bounty hunter is defeated far too easily considering his cleverness and combat skills were abilities to marvel at in The Empire Strikes Back.  Hence, in the next set of films the bounty hunter's family is revisited in hopes to bring back the bounty hunter who many viewers were captivated by in The Empire Strikes Back.
Again, another family secret is revealed that foretells either doom or an advantage for the empire.  Why not have something different like another faction of militants emerge? Like a forgotten Jedi warrior--who Lucas based of knights during the era of Feudalism but another group during that time was important as well and that group was rebellious women who were labeled as witches so---why not have new militants arise who are based off witches from the era of Feudalism and have the women combat everyone else as the women seek to obtain territory and a government of their own?
Instead, a different militant group of natives that are teddy-bear-like creatures are bestowed.  Lucas originally wanted creatures of wookies but didn't have the funds---that's why they appear in Revenge of Sith, Lucas finally had the money to film a battle with wookies.----The result is this immature humor encompassing a stereotype portrayal of aboriginals and Native Americans.
 Finally, the main good characters act incompetent when compared to previous films.  Luke Skywalker does not use the force when batting a monster when in the previous film he did use the force thus, Luke had learned he could fight monsters with the force.  Moreover, Han Solo no longer is skilled with technology as he was in the previous movies.  Instead, Han Solo cannot force open an electronic door which should be an easy feat for him to overcome.  Duly, one has to conclude that being frozen made Han Solo unintelligent because in the next sequel he makes bigger mistakes that result in the loss of his cargo and the loss of his life.  The Empire Strikes Back had revealed that Han was becoming clever, but Return of the Jedi shows Han regressing in his wit and abilities; that diminishing continues in the next sequel.

In conclusion, Return of the Jedi is not very good.  The movie reuses past ideas, previous characters who were smart are now dull-witted or are simply killed off, childish humor engulfs a major part of the film making that segment hard to watch, and the science fiction author Leigh Brackett is absent from the story writing thus the story is not as good as the previous film.  These are all signs of what is to come in the following films that were released for the Star Wars series: the next batch of movies reuse ideas, bombard the story with immature humor while simultaneously making past characters stupider or showing stereotypes of human races, and the next films do not have good science fiction writers composing the screenplay.  Hence, Return of the Jedi is the cornerstone of the Star Wars series falling apart.",1467590400,,4981,4.855962219598584

If Lucas feels the need to retouch up to death one of his older projects let him choose Howard the Duck or something less dear to me!

My Journey an enjoyable one is now complete......for now (I now await the Blu-ray release of 'The Force Awakens'
.....MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU......
Some years have now past -
Before 'Luke Skywalker' (Mark Hamill) can fulfil his destiny he has to rescue his close friend and ally 'Han Solo' ( Harrison Ford)
from the clutches of 'Jabba he Hutt' with the help of 'Princess Leia' (Carrie Fisher) along with 'Han's' old friend 'Lando Cairissian'
(Billy Dee Williams) not forgetting droids 'C-3PO' (voiced by Anthony Daniels) 'R2-D2' (voiced by Kenny Baker) and 'Han Solo's'
trusted companion 'Chewbacca' (Peter Mahew)
'Luke's' powers have grown, however some time ago he had promised 'Yoda' (voiced by Frank Oz) that he would return to complete
his training to become a 'Jedi Knight'
Before 900 year-old 'Yoda' seemingly departs this life he tells 'Luke' that he already has the powers he needs but to become the
'Jedi Knight' he craves to be he has to again face the Dark-Knight, his father - 'Darth Vader' (David Prowse) and defeat him.
The Empire are in the process of re-fitting and improving the 'Death Star' the completion work of which is being personally overseen
by the Dark Lord himself, 'The Emperor' (Ian McDiarmid) has joined him to see his vision fulfilled.
'Darth Vader' and the Emperor want to draw 'Luke' into the Dark-Side they fear his power could destroy them should they fail to do so.
'Luke' though the prospect of having to kill his father is daunting he and his team must try to destroy the 'Death Star' before it's
power is ready for use.
The battle to reclaim the Galaxy from the Dark-Side begins......
Can 'Luke' and his companions defeat those that had all but destroyed the 'Jedi' and now threaten total domination of the Galaxy ??
Another action-packed fun and thrill-ride in which we meet even more bizarre creatures, some allies some foe.....more galactic
battle sequences and indeed more 'Lightsaber' action.
The Special-Effects of this 1983 Spectacle again way ahead of it's time.
The responsibility to continue the saga is now in the hands of the Disney-Studio (Seems with 'The Force Awakens) they've made a pretty impressive start breaking all box-office records......i look forward to continuing the journey when released on Blu-ray/ DVD.",1460851200,,2373,4.979848866498741

2201884,5,B00076SCPW,"I'm a first generation Star Wars fan, and in my opinion the Original Trilogy is the reason they invented movie theaters. That said, I never thought Return Of The Jedi was as good as the other two movies. My principal reasons for this was 1. The Ewoks! Right, so a bunch of teddy bears is the reason good triumphed over evil and the galaxy was freed from the oppression of the evil Empire!, and 2. Of the lead actors, only Mark Hamill bright his A-Game to the movie. He was brilliant, and did a better job acting with a dying muppet than either Carrie Fisher, who wasn't up-to-par with her performance in the previous movies, and especially Harrison Ford, who obviously flat-out did not want to be there.
Now, that was my initial reaction, and I stand by it. However, a lot has happened since 1983, notably a prequel trilogy which was a great story in itself, but catches a lot of flack for its terrible dialogue and bad acting (personally I think the cast acted their butts off, the dialogue was just embarrassing!) and the first act of a sequel trilogy which so far is a remake of the original trilogy and I hope the next 2 movies have a new twist in them somewhere.
So, after these 4 movies, all of which I love, even though I see their flaws and shortcomings, Return Of The Jedi can be forgiven its own shortcomings and take its rightful place at the side of its two predecessors. There really wasn't a better way to end the trilogy than the story that was told. So if you still hate the Ewoks after seeing Jar Jar Binks and the rest of the loonies of the prequels, watch it and laugh as they are killed off at the battle of Endor. Myself, I have peace with them, as they are in the same awesome movie that saw Luke Skywalker redeem his father, enabling him to finally bring balance to the Force and reunite with Obi-Wan and Yoda.",1459209600,,1833,4.346938775510204

Jabba's palace has an extra CGI scene where the band is singing. Totally unnecessary. I had the privilege of showing the Star Wars series to someone who had never seen any of them. Even she looked at me and said, wow! that was really out of place! I had to explain how the original didn't have that. I hope Disney releases the original cuts. On the plus side? The remaster is brilliant. The color and surround sound is amazing. I wish Lucas would have just cleaned it up and released it. To be fair, some of the extras Mr. Lucas added were very cool in my opinion. They fit in seamlessly, add to the film, and they are almost unnoticeable. However, these huge changes he made, like the aforementioned Jaba band scene were uncalled for.",1457481600,,887,4.515527950310559

The Lucas special edition effects are still a drag, though, and the Anakin ""upgrade"" at the end of the film is completely cringe-worthy. Still, various sequences such as the heroics of Luke and crew on Tatooine, the speeder chase through the forest, and the Falcon soaring through the superstructure of Death Star #2 make this one fantastic, and while the fighting teddy bears are just as silly 30 years later there's still just so much to enjoy.

The Plot: Continuing on from ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of the slug-like alien gangster Jabba the Hutt. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO attempt to rescue their captive comrade. Reunited after an epic rescue, our heroes continue their fight against the Empire. The Empire have started construction on a new and more powerful Death Star. Our heroes must launch a daring assault before this new battle station becomes operational. Meanwhile, the Emperor and Darth Vader conspire to turn Luke to the dark side. In one last thrilling stand on and above the forest moon of Endor, the rebels battle the Imperial forces while Luke meets the Emperor and confronts Darth Vader one last time in a very gripping and emotional lightsaber duel to the death.

An action-packed and emotional thrill ride that concludes the saga (well, at least until ""The Force Awakens"")! Highly Recommended!",1455408000,,1143,5.172972972972973

2201984,5,B00076SCPW,"This one was yet another fond favorite from my childhood just as much as the other 2 Star Wars movies are and will always be.  It was awesome to have yet another Star Wars movie that was made in the 80's.  This one was the last one both of the original trilogy and of the 80's as well and man did this part of the series ever go out with a colossal bang.  This review has spoilers in it, so if you don't want any spoilers, then this review is not for you.

A few facts about the film:  This time the director was Richard Marquand.  The producer was Howard Kazanjian. George Lucas came up with the story, was the executive producer, and he wrote the screenplay with Lawrence Kasdan.  The production company was Lucasfilm Ltd.  It was distributed by 20th Century Fox.  It's release date was May 25, 1983.  The music was still by John Williams.  The Budget was 32.5 million dollars.  Finally, it's total domestic gross via the box office was, $252,583,617.

We still get to enjoy the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewie, Princess Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, Jedimaster Yoda, Wedge Antilles, Lando Calrissian, Darth Vader, and bounty hunter Boba Fett.  This time we're finally introduced to Emperor Palpatine and Jabba the Hutt.  For the one and(so far) the only time the Ewoks get introduced.  Other than that the Ewoks were featured in a Saturday morning cartoon show and two spin-off movies.

Luke is now a Jedi Knight looking to become a Jedi.  Han is between his need to be rescued from Jabba the Hutt and his continued commitment to his friends and their struggle against the Galactic Empire.  Chewbacca(Chewie) is ready for action as well as his continued loyalty to Han and his friends.  Princess Leia gets to be more a part of the action than previously.  C-3PO and R2-D2 still deliver the laughs from their ""Odd Couple""-type bickering.  Lando Calrissian gets much more involved in the rebellion.  Upon the emperor's arrival, Emperor Palpatine is intent on crushing the rebellion, seeing that the new Death Star is finished being built, and very much intends to see that Darth Vader gets his son Luke to join the dark side.  Boba Fett is still pursuing Han and whatnot.  Yoda reaches closure for the needed training for Luke.  Wedge Antilles still remains an ace fighter pilot.  Jabba the Hutt proves one vile, sadistic, over-confident, abrasive, twisted, slug-like, morbidly obese, intergalactic mafia type.  Finally, the Ewoks came to be very cute, bear-like, primitive/tribal, creatures, that come to be surprisingly valuable allies to our heroes.

The planets this time are:  once again Luke's home planet, the desert planet Tatooine and Yoda's swampy planet Dagobah.  This time around there's the Ewoks forest planet of Endor.  There's lots of beautiful cinematography and panoramic shots featured for each planet.  As always these truly feel like their real, existing planets.

The special effects keep on getting better and move real looking come this chapter.  The blasters and lightsabers look so much more awesome and real than they did previously.  The spaceships are truly larger than life in both their looks and in their fire power.  the views of the planets look nice and 3-D.  The animatronics are really great.  They are all very convincing.  Yoda and the Ewoks are among my favorites.  The props are great as always.  The designs for the spaceships, the spaceship interiors, the command stations, and the interior of places, all show loads of brilliant imagination and practical thought.

The action sequences show a boatload of variety.  The final lightsaber fights between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, the shoot-outs  between our heroes and the stormtroopers on Endor, the fights against the Imperial walkers also on Endor, the space dogfights, the blaster and lightsaber fights with Jabba the Hutt's henchmen, the destruction of the Death Star, and my personal favorite, Luke and his sister Leia's fight with stormtroopers while riding speeder bikes on Endor.

Princess Leia sure looks smokin' hot in that slave girl outfit.  Very sexy costume choice for sure.

All in all, the closure to this original trilogy proved epic in that they pulled out all the stops; all kinds of action between Endor, space, and Tatooine, the multiple new creatures such as the Rancor, Jabba the Hutt, Bib Fortuna, Salacious Crumb, Gamorrean pig guards, the Ewoks, the Sarlacc Pit monster etc., the romance/conciliation between Han Solo and Princess Leia, the fight to put an end of the Empire; Luke's lightsaber fight with Darth Vader, Vader's redemption via his issue(s) with the emperor, Yoda's dramatic final days, the destruction of the Death Star, Han's rescue from Jabba the Hutt on Tatoonie, the Ewoks clobbering some stormtroopers, and most of all the victory celebration/party on Endor.  This movie thoroughly wraps up every loose end and gives way to a happy ending.  This one is a must to the collection of every sci-fi fan, every action fan, Star Wars fans(of course)and anyone that just plain loves an epically brilliant and awesome film, to say nothing of timeless gem.

I can tell anyone hesitating to buy these to go ahead and do it, they're fun and entertainment. Don't get caught up in the originals vs the special editions debate. That is foolish and unwarranted.

2202055,4,B00076SCPW,"Although I like the Prequels on average better than the Originals, I have to say that this is one of my favorite Star Wars films I've seen so far (I might see the ""Force Awakens"" Wednesday), this is the Star Wars movie that always seems to wrap up all six films into one epic and emotional conclusion. This is the conclusion of Anakin Skywalker's story, that starts with an innocent young boy leaving the desert to become a hero, tragically turning evil, and being put into a suit, closing out the person he once was, and finally, finding his good again through his son Luke Skywalker. The same music plays when Anakin leaves his home, that plays during his funeral, and it just seems to bring this point home. Honestly though, I have to say that my favorite version of this film is the 1997 VHS release. Sure, I'd prefer to watch the originals over the edited versions most of the time, but in 1997, John Williams created the most heartfelt tune for The Victory Celebration that completes the first six films on the best note possible, after all they've been through, all the tragedy of Anakin's fall, they have finally brought balance to the force (Whatever that means. Defeating the Sith maybe, because Kylo Ren isn't a Sith I hear), and that is just perfect. The 2004 DVD version still has the great music, so I'd choose it over the 1983 still, but it is sort of depressing, considering that they replaced Sabastian Shaw's face with Hayden Christiansen's, basically saying that the original release isn't canon, so I prefer the 1997 version if possible. There are a few problems with the movie though. that I should address. The first is that at one point in the movie, there is a horrible scene of torture, that is hard for me to watch sometimes, but upon reflection I realize that having a hard time watching it causes me to realize that I haven't become desensitized in compassion, and I don't ever want to not suffer while watching that scene. The last one might be the only reason that I'm even giving it four stars in the first place instead of five, I don't like one of Leah's outfits, it's disturbing, and that's something (unlike Luke's scene) I don't want to suffer through.",1450742400,,2188,4.59846547314578

2202059,1,B00076SCPW,"Unfortunately, among the films making up the original trilogy, this is the DVD or blu-ray that Lucas tinkered the most with, egregiously so.  Therefore, while this blu-ray represents the best visual reproduction to date (for some, depending on locale and theater better than the original shown on the big screen), changes and additions made throughout post-theatrical release effectively ruins the viewing experience for anyone that saw the original and, I would suggest, those that haven't as well.  The result is a prime example of ego and stylistic changes over substance.  Hopefully one day Disney will re-release the theatrical version?

2202190,4,B00076SCPW,"Well,  Luke  (Mark Hamill)  has  put  aside  hesitation,  he  is  no  longer  nervous  or  afraid  to  face  what  he  must. &  he's  finally  learned  how  to  use  the  power  of  the  force,  what  Yoda  was  expecting  him  to  learn.  How  is  that  possible  making  things  float  in  the  air?  Gee  Golly  gosh.  Yoda  may  have  to  explain  that  to  me.  Children,  don't  get  your  hopes  too  high.  That  isn't  possible  in  reality!
Luke  has  worked  his  way  into  professionalism,  &  you  know  he's  bound  to  gain  the  upper  hand.  So  in  the  beginning  of  the  movie  when  he  rescued  Han Solo  (Harrison Ford) that  was  the  perfect  test  for  him  to  see  what  he's  achieved.  Jabba  is  a  couch potato  &  a  snob,  a  spoiled  one  at  that. He  only  cares  for  the  entertainment  &  partying  with  his  friends.  Luke  was  going  to  be  sentenced  to  death,  him  &  his  friends,  into  the  pit  with  a  beak.  Once  your  in  &  that  thing  grabs  you  there  is  no  escape!  What  Jabba  didn't  know  was  Luke  had  a  pretty  handy  trick  up  his  sleeve.  &  has  his  victory  over  Jabba.  Along  side  of  him  in  Hans  rescue  attempt  was  Lando Calrission  (Billy Dee Williams)  still  doing  what  he  can  to  make  up  for  what  he  did.

Okay  who  plays  the  emperor  again?  I  knew  (David Prowse)  did  Darth Vader,  not  his  voice  though,  that's  (James Earl Jones)  famous  for  his  low  deep  voice.
So  they're  working  on  a  new  death  star.  &  even  being  not  fully  built  is  supposed  to  be  more  powerful  then  the  first  one.  The  second  one  is  protected  by  a  shield,  while  its  being  built?  My  question  is  this,  would  this  one  orbit  through  space  destroying  planets  &  stuff  like  the  old  one?  They  never  said  what  was  in  store  for  it  exactly.  I  wonder  a  lot  of  times.  It  never  did  get  finished  to  where  it  looked  like  the  old  one.  I  am  just  a  little  surprised  the  Emperor  didn't  have  his  own  thrown  room  on  the  old  one,  Instead  all  we  see  is  Vader's  superior,  a  fellow  known  as  Tarkin. He  was  in  charge.
The  rebels  form  a  huge  alliance  for  a  battle  against  the  emperor  &  the  new  Death Star.  Meanwhile  before  hand  Luke  goes  to  the  Dagoba  System  to  find  Yoda  &  complete  his  training.  But  Yoda  could  see  Luke  was  ready.  No  more  training  do  you  require.  &  he  also  gives  Luke  some  important  answers  before  his  death.
After  that  Luke  &  his  friends  head  to  the  planet  Indoor.  They  meet  the  woodland  creatures  known  as  Ewoks  that  remind  me  of  Teddy bears  kind  of.  Looking  at  their  bodies  though  they're  round.
Yet  Luke  cannot  stay  with  his  friends  very  long,  he  must  face  his  father  Vader,  When  Vader  feels  Luke's  presence  Luke  Tells  Lea (Carrie Fisher)  he  must  surrender,  refusing  her  advice  on  him  running  far  away, She  was  surprised  to  learn  her  &  Luke  were  actually  related.  So  Luke  goes  &  sees  if  there  is  any  good  in  him  at  all. Soon  the  battle  is  on  between  everyone.  Luke  did  good  facing  Darth  Vader,  I  mean  better  than  last  time.  But  refuses  to  join  forces  with  the  Emperor.  In  my opinion  he  shouldn't  have  thrown  his  Light Saber  away, The  Emperor  shows  Luke  just  how  powerful  he  is.  The  Emperor  is  mean  &  fearless.  &  would  be  difficult  to  confront.
&  more  than  1000  volts  of  electricity  hit  Luke  for  about  5  minutes  before  Vader  saves  him.  &  he  dies  shortly  afterwards.  Lando  meanwhile  gets  to  the  main reactor  &  destroys  the  Death Star.  &  they  didn't  waste  time  like  they  did  in  (A new Hope)  where  they  spent  a  lot  of  time  before  they  destroyed  the  station.
Luke  has  a  moment  alone  with  his  now  deceased  father,
before  Joining  his  friends  in  the  huge  celebration.  Everybody's  happy  now,  (Obi wan Kobi, Vader, & Yoda)  Who's  spirit's  are  watching.  &  for  the  record  you  guys,  I  still  enjoy  all  3  movies!  Its  the  kind  of  movies  you  never  get  tired  of.  They'll  last  a  lifetime!!",1434240000,,4274,4.302189781021898

2202207,5,B00076SCPW,"All good things must come to an end, and so it is with the Star Wars saga.  Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi is the thrilling conclusion to the story told over six movies.  While it's not the best, it's still fun.

The story picks up pretty much where we left the characters at the end of the last film.  Han Solo (Harrison Ford) has been captured by Jabba the Hutt and is still frozen in carbonite, a trophy in Jabba's palace.  But his friends aren't going to give up.  Before long, everyone has snuck their way into Jabba's house to try to free him.  Will they succeed?

Of course, that's only part of the problem.  The empire is building a replacement Death Star, bigger and better.  They are currently hiding it behind the forest moon of Endor.  The alliance needs to take it out once and for all, meaning that a group, led by Han and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) need to go down to the planet and disable a shield generator.  Another assault will be led by Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) as he tries to take down the Death Star.  And Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)?  Well, he's going to be busy confronting his father, Darth Vader, and the Emperor himself.  Will they finally be able to overthrow the oppressive empire once and for all?

This movie seems to fall into two camps, either you love it or you can't stand it.  Those who don't like it have some valid points.  The movie is really two stories wrapped in one with very little to connect them.  Then there's the Death Star II.  I mean, haven't we already destroyed one of these things?  Couldn't Lucas come up with something new for our heroes to have to fight?

While I absolutely agree these flaws are there, I still like the film.  The action keeps moving forward constantly, never letting down for a minute.  Okay, so the big finale with three different battles going on can be a bit much, but I still like it.

Plus I love Endor.  Unlike some people, I actually like the cute little Ewoks, the miniature teddy bear like creatures that inhabit the moon.  Plus I love redwood forests, and if I can't be in one, watching action in one is the next best thing.

The special effects continue to improve.  Yes, there are times when you can tell they are faking something, but that's to be expected when a movie is almost 30 years old.  Usually you can get so lost in the moment that you buy what is on the screen.

The acting?  Well, it's never been a strong point in the series.  It's fine here, but still has occasional bits of cheese.  Then again, since the script has its share of cheese, you can hardly blame it all on the actors.

My biggest problem with the movie comes from a minor plot point.  In the last movie, Lando has betrayed our heroes.  Here, he's part of the alliance with no mention of his treachery.  That has never quite sat well with me, but I just ignore it and enjoy the film as is.

This movie definitely works best if you've seen the last two in the series.  Otherwise, much of the character interaction won't make sense.  You don't need to watch all of the movies since Episodes 1-3 were filmed after this one was completed.  However, if you do watch all six movies, you get the complete saga of the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.  The ending is just as powerful if you just watch the original trilogy, however.

Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi is a fun conclusion to the Star Wars movies.  Despite the flaws, this fan finds it quite enjoyable.",1430697600,,3465,4.38740157480315

Luke, in New Hope and Empire, was always getting his butt kicked or being rescued by Han. Finally he does the rescuing and boy its amazing. If you wanted you could make the first 40 minutes it's own movie. Luke comes out swinging like a champ taking Jabba and saving Han. I quote, ""You should of bargin Jabba .

2202220,5,B00076SCPW,"I grew up with Star Wars as a kid(I was like 7 when I got into it, so like 2003.) When I grew up, there were a lot of things about Star Wars that I never realized, such as the fact that everybody hates Jar Jar Binks(I was a kid, I thought he was funny), nobody likes the prequels and, in this case, most people consider Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi to not be as good as the first two.
I personally think that's ridiculous. Episode VI is everything you could hope for for an ending to this legendary trilogy. It's definitely the most epic of the original three.
Usually the material seems to be running dry by the third film, but not in this case. The whole second Death Star thing surprisingly doesn't feel repetitive.(You would think that it would.)
The stakes are at an all time high. If the rebels lose this battle, they are done forever. Same goes for the Empire. There's no going back.
My hands down favorite part of Episode VI will always be the entire segment in The Emperor's throne room. It's all so epic. The final fight between Luke and Vader is the most epic and beautiful scene in the entire saga.
The ending takes the story far, to a place of no return. It gives you a good scene of closure.
The ending scene always made me cry because... well... this is it. I mean yeah, there was the prequels, but those take place before. This is it. This is the end of the story of Star Wars. It's going to be weird watching that scene with the sequel trilogy and the spin off trilogy coming out. However, I cannot possibly be more excited about the thought that the saga is about to continue....",1427241600,,1608,4.275409836065574

2202239,5,B00076SCPW,"Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi is the final installment of the original Star Wars trilogy. In the final episode of the Star Wars saga,Han Solo emerges intact from the carbonated casing in which he'd been sealed. The bad news is that Solo, together with Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, is prisoner to the grotesque Jabba the Hutt. But with the help of the charismatic Lando Calrissian, our heroes and our heroine manage to escape. The evil Galactic Empire, with the help of the villainous Darth Vader, is building a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance which brings to the conclusion wherein the we get to know that Luke Skywalker's real father is the Darth Vader.

This installment is considered by many to be the best of the first three original Star Wars in terms of technical accomplishment and narrative involvement. But yet that outline is buried beneath an obnoxiously hyped-up pace that reduces the emotions to rubble. It is not as exciting as Episode IV itself, which had the advantage of novelty. But it is better and more satisfying than Episode V only in terms of entertainment. But nevertheless, acting better than in the previous films and it still had its moments.

2202262,5,B00076SCPW,"Im so glad I now own a copy of the limited edition version of Jedi.!!  This is the theatrical version we all remember that was the classic. No cgi tenticals coming out from the pit of sarlaac. No hayden Christianson as the Jedi ghost.  Original ending without all that enhanced Naboo over the top garbage.

  Its apparently the laser disc version converted to dvd, but personally, I think the grain in the film makes it even more true to the style and ambiance of the world of star wars. I think technology over the years has spoiled most of us as viewers on what to expect in quality. Blu-ray definitely has done that.  (Not disrespecting the quality of blu ray here) Most of us have star wars on blu-ray, or even a copy thats enhanced dvd. So when you compare that to this copy,  there is a difference. This is not enhanced.  Its just what it was at the time.  Thats all.  Its so cool I had to get episode IV and V  as well.  They're just as good, if not great..

The one thing that doesnt make sence is the 2.0 sound. Thats ridiculous.

Its so refreshing to see these movies as I remember them!!  What a fantastic relieved experience to view the original like we've seen them many, many years ago.

  If you are interested in this, in the slightest way, don't hesitate.  Remember,  this is a limited edition and there is no other original copy like this available except VHS. Will you buy VHS?",1399680000,,1396,4.357976653696498

2202266,4,B00076SCPW,"The more appropriate rating for this release would really be about 3-and-a-half stars. But I've rounded it up, since it is actually quite on the better side.

I purchased this back in 2006 at Wal-Mart when it was first released. Until just recently, I have only bothered to watch the ""updated"" version of this episode and not the original, theatrical version that is included in the bonus disc. But I decided to give it a go, so I watched the theatrical version out. Anyways, here's what I experienced and the opinion I've developed with this release:

ON THE UPDATED VERSION:

Even though some people might not agree with me, the ""Digitally Remastered"" version (as it says on the back cover) of this Star Wars episode looks amazing and updated nicely: the quality has really been updated to nearly the standard of any of today's movies. There don't appear to be any real annoying Digital Noise Reductions (DNR), something that can really cause allot of annoying ""clayface"". But you won't see any of that here. The Color Correcting, I felt, could have done better here; but it stills looks really good and doesn't take away from anything (but, if you want to see the original trilogy in THE BEST color and quality, I'd suggest that you get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-Ray/dp/B00E9PMMX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-Ray</a>&nbsp;versions). The audio is just prefect, 'Nuff said.
Oh, and the updates: there are some fixes on the effects and such that isn't really noticeable (for example, it doesn't look like Luke & Darth Vader's lightsaber blades are passing through each other anymore in the last duel on the Death Star), but are really a great improvement. On the added and redone updates, I'll go through each of the bigger ones and give my opinion on them:

1. Jabba's palace now has a bigger CG (Computer Generated) door.

OPINION: Meh, I though it was alright. I looks pretty good, but it really isn't anything outstanding.

2. Remember that old sing-and-dance routine at Jabba's Palace in the theatrical version? It has been redone here, with completely new actors and CG creatures.

OPINION: It's alright. It looks alright, and doesn't take away any of the originality of the film.

3. The Sarlacc now has added CG tentacles and a CG beak at it's center.

OPINION: Though not as noticeable as the other updates, I though that it looked pretty cool and made the Sarlacc feel ALLOT  more real.

4. The Ewoks now have blinking CG eyes.

OPINION: Really cool! Makes them look and feel allot more lifelike and not like teddy bears!

5. The explosion of the Death Star II now has been updated with the Praxis effect (just look it up on Wikipedia if you don't know what the Praxis effect is).

OPINION: To be honest, this is perhaps my favorite update. I really liked the updated explosions of the planet Alderaan and the first Death Star in the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/updated-version-of-Episode-IV/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">updated version of Episode IV </a>. They look so much larger and are really quite breathtaking in a way for me. Really loved this updated.

7. Sebastian Shaw's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in spirit form has been replaced with Hayden Christensen.

OPINION: It was alright. Nice tie-in with the prequel trilogy, though.

Overall, I think that this version, even though not perfect, is still none-the-less a great film that is defiantly worth getting. The updates, though controversial to some, are still pretty good and are worth the watch.

ON THE THEATRICAL VERSION:

It seems that this is the area were most people seem to find a problem with. As you may already know, the theatrical version of this film was uploaded unto DVD via a LaserDisc transfer. This causes the DVD to be non-anamorphic. That means that the film itself has a low visual clarity and won't fill a flatscreen TV. I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JVC-EM37T-37-Class-720P-60Hz-D-LED-HDTV/dp/B0094NPQ3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JVC EM37T 37"" Class 720P 60Hz D-LED HDTV</a>; I played the theatrical version of this movie on it, and the picture only filled 1/3 of the screen. If you think about it, that is a pretty ""short (from top-to-bottom of picture)"" and came come to be quite annoying to some people. I'm pretty sure that they could have done a better job at the quality and size of the release. But to be honest, this didn't bother me too much. Though it may not be of the highest quality, it's not unviewable in the least: I still had a good time watching this episode in it's unaltered form, and the picture size didn't bother me a bit. Though some people may not share this same view, I'm sure that at least a good count of other people will find it no real big problem.

Overall, this is a pretty good release of one of the greatest movie classics of all time. The updated version isn't completely perfect, but still a GREAT film none-the-less. The original, theatrical version, eh, could have been ALLOT better: but it's still a great way to see Star Wars as the first generation of fans saw them back in the day. There really is nothing with this release that should hold you back from picking up a copy. All around enjoyable, and the updated version is in really great quality. I can't say if you'll enjoy it as much as I did, but whatever opinion you come to on this release, I'm sure you won't find it a total waist.",1393459200,,5498,5.027502750275027

2202276,4,B00076SCPW,"Return of the Jedi is my least favourite Star Wars film from the original trilogy, which isn't saying much, since it outranks both Phantom Menace and and Attack of the Clones by a light year, and is only just inferior to the brutal Revenge of the Sith.

Naturally, the big reason for Return's downfall are those cute, cuddly, teddy bear-looking creatures called Ewoks. Yes, they do provide comic relief and look cute (And no matter what they say, NO ONE hated the Ewoks when they were kids. Proven fact.) But really? Return of the Jedi should be the darkest Star Wars film of them all - a brutal one-upper to Empire Strikes Back (a really impossible act to follow, actually), giving impossible odds and dangerous battles, finally ending on a beautiful ray of hope.

Not so, and we take an unwanted detour in Endor, (AND with Jabba, though Carrie Fisher kind of makes up for that...), and we have the overr-used trope of the Death Star, which, OH, has the exact same weakness as the first, and is even LESS threatening since it doesn't destroy any planets.

But really, Jedi has a LOT of things going for it. First of all, we get to see Luke go all badass Jedi on us. Who knew Mark Hamill cut such a mean figure in black? Then of course there's Carrie Fisher, and the infamous gold bikini (which makes up for any lost time we have at Jabba's). Then there's the much awaited return of Harrison Ford, who embodies everything that makes Star Wars great. When Han is on the screen, everything is approximately 33.33% better.

Second, there's some great action scenes: Luke vs. Jabba Monster, Jabba vs. Jedi, Endor forest chase (amazing scene), and plenty of awesome lightsaber duels. Added to that is the most poignant character development of the entire trilogy, as we see Luke go from light to dark, dark to light, all the while debating with himself and his inner reason. Darth Vader gets some awesome scenes, as does Palpatine, who takes it upon himself at this moment to become a palpable (pun intended) force to be reckoned with, rather than the figure behind the scenes. The climax is never as awesome or hardhitting as it should be, but Luke and Vader's final scene is very moving.

Return of the Jedi isn't the greatest of Star Wars films (Following in Irvin Kershner's footprints is a tall order) , but it is far from the worst, and is fun, enjoyable, and to this day a grand motion picture! Return is a fitting end of perhaps the most incredible saga ever filmed, and set in a galaxy far, far away....",1378252800,,2507,4.574610244988864

Yes they are a coversion from laser disk, are they the hi-quality remasted digital picture that we are accustomed too today, no. They are still better than the old VHS version, and to me that is part of the Beauity of it. You get to see Star Wars for what it was. You get to seen a nice clean film with good sound, with an emphisis on plot and story as well as on speical effects. Let Lucas keep his remaster, re-touching, and redubbing, and give me this, its what the Star Wars of my memoires are.

To me that is part of the problem with the new thee installments, they look awsome, the plot was good, the writing was squishy. Too much reliance on state of the art sound and visual FX not enough time/money on dialogue.

So let lucas keep his ""remastering"" I'll take my laser disk recopy and my vintage feel. I've never met a kid didn't go ""WOH"" when they see Episode IV, V, & VI the first time.

2202314,3,B00076SCPW,"Even as an eight, nine, ten year old child I knew Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi was the worst of the original trilogy. As I child I think I would I still would have given it a high score 4 to 4.5 stars because I was a kid. Still I didn't enjoy the film as nearly as much as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. As I got older I asked myself after the good and great build up in story and characters could The Return of the Jedi be such a letdown in those two categories. There is a major character suicide as I call it and long with other pointless characters and story arcs. That is what I will be getting to in my review of Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi, and the worst of all of the Star Wars films.

First I'll give you the plot of the film which by now you all should know and I won't be spoiling anything for anyone. The film starts a few years after the conclusion of The Empire Strikes Back, and back on the planet Tatooine and Jabba the Hutt's base of operations where he has Han Solo imprisoned as a trophy. Leia tries to infiltrate Jabba's palace disguised as bounty hunter to free Han. She does free him, but the both quickly are captured. C-3PO and R2-D2 arrive shortly later with a message from The Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and later Luke arrives and is capture as well. The group his freed while awaiting execution over the Sarlacc pit with the help of Lando Calrissian. In escaping they kill Jabba and Boba Fett. With their escape the group again splits up with Luke heading again to see Yoda while the rest of the group joins up with the rebels. On Dagobah Yoda confirms that Darth Vader is his father, and after Yoda's passing Luke learns that Leia's his sister. Luke meets up with the Rebel fleet and they learn that the Empire is constructing another Death Star above the Endor. Han leads a team of Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and some soldiers down to the planet to take out the shield generator while Lando and the fleet wait for it to go down and attack. Things don't go according to plan as the Emperor has predicted their moves. On Endor Luke is captured and taken up to the Death Star with his father while Han and his team are capture. In space the Rebel fleet is ambushed by the Imperial fleet and they learn that the Death Star is fully operational. On Endor Han and his team are freed by Ewoks and they take down the generator. On the Death Star Luke fights his father and wins, but doesn't kill him which leads to the Emperor using his powers and Darth Vader killing the Emperor at the cost of his own life. In the space battle Lando and his team attack and destroy the Death Star. The rebels have won and celebrate on Endor.

This is the worst writing job George Lucas has done. I really don't know what he was thinking with this film. The first half was really good with Jabba's palace, the Sarlacc pit and Luke returning to Dagobah. Once you get by that point things quickly go downhill. I mean the second half of the film is essentially the same plot as the first. I mean couldn't he have made the climax somewhere more interesting like on Coruscant. I think that would have been much better than a rehash of the end of the first film. Next are the Ewoks who were truly pointless characters. I hear people complain and complain about Jar Jar Binks. Sure he was a little annoying, but at least he served a purpose story wise, and you can't say the same for the Ewoks. Now every time I see the film and Endor I think of South Park and the hilarious Chewbacca Defense. I mean these character's served no purpose but for attract kids and Merchandise. Finally we come to the biggest issue I have with the film, and that is the mishandling of the character Darth Vader. I mean really at the last second he has a change of heart just because Luke says please. I know I know people will say it's his son, but you forget the man killed his wife and has most likely killed hundreds of people and helped kill tens of thousands, and just in a few seconds he has a change of heart. In the prequels you at least get the buildup to Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side in The Attack of the Clones and The Revenge of the Sith with The Emperor using his love and fear of losing Padme along with his mother's murder and the lack of respect he thought he was getting from the Jedi Counsel. In the original trilogy we get none of that build up and it ends up being completely out of character. Finally on a personal note how dare they kill off Boba Fett one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars series, and they gave him a crappy death as well. Return of the Jedi could have been an amazing end to wonderful and unique story. This is the one time I will truly put blame on Lucas. He's proven he's a good writer and idea's man, so why couldn't he have found a better way to end his story.

Even with the truly disappointing writing the acting was well done by the main cast, but was again hampered by the Ewoks who got too much screen time and took away from the other characters. Billy Dee Williams hardly got any screen time as Lando. The same can be said for Chewbacca who is a great character has his screen time limited thanks to those pesky Ewoks. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill do a splendid job as Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. Harrison Ford is always good, but Mark and Carrie show major improvement from A New Hope and you can see it in the characters. Ian McDiarmid does a good job in his limited role as the emperor, and does an even better job in the prequels. It's kind of sad though when you think about it. All these pretty talented actors and the only one who has a major career is Harrison Ford. Carrie's career faltered as she only managed guest appearances on television shows. Mark did manage to do all right for himself with his really good voice acting and his truly memorable job as the voice of the joker in many Batman cartoons and films. Still none reached the heights that Harrison did.

ILM again did an excellent job doing the effects for the film bring to live Lucas's universe. The action was pretty well done except I again have complaints about Endor and those pesky Ewoks. Really three feet Ewoks are going to fight an imperial garrison. Still the scene was well done. The directing was not done well by Richard Marquand who had done nothing before this film and nothing after. I know all the Lucas haters out there will try to put the blame on him, but he's proven he can write and direct well. He did it with the prequels and A New Hope. I think why the film wasn't good was because of his writing. I've read that he had written the complete saga before he did the films, but I don't believe that otherwise he would have written a better ending to the trilogy. I think Lucas had a detailed outline of how he wanted the series to go, but didn't write a detailed ending till right before Return of the Jedi. It happens with many novel series and long running TV shows. When the writers begin to write they might have a basic idea how they want things to end, but getting there is the problem and doing it right. Sadly Lucas messed up on this one. He'd make it up in his prequels, but A New Hope will be remembered as the letdown of the series. Oh I can't believe I forgot to mention John Williams in the previous reviews, and I like the guy. He has done so many great scores from all the Star Wars films to Minority Report to the first two Jaws films, and many other memorable scores.

Is Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi the worst of all six Star Wars films? Without question yes it is. It had potential in the beginning to be great, but with a bad script, a major character flaw, bad directing and pointless characters Return of the Jedi failed to live up to the successes of the first two films. What the film has going for it is was the first half of the film, along with the three main actors, effects and music by John Williams. Overall a disappointing conclusion to a wonderful journey I have taken many times as a child and an adult. Next up is my review of Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace",1350086400,,8110,4.246601941747572
2202315,2,B00076SCPW,"I bought this soley for the second disc, the original 1983 theatrical version, because it was the only way to get *that film* on DVD. So if that is what you are looking for, try to track one of these down (it is out of print now). I truly hope that someday George Lucas, or more probably someone else, will take the time and put in the well-worth it effort to give the original (un-""enhanced"") Star Wars trilogy films the release that they deserve. But I am not holding my breath on that.

Regarding Return of the Jedi as a film, it is very entertaining, but a mixed bag nonetheless. The Jabba's place sequence is pretty good for the most part, the space battle is still today an incredibly exciting masterpiece of visual effects, and the climactic Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader/Emperor duel is just about perfect. The major downside of the film is the Ewoks. They are cute, but not at all believable, and their usage cheapens the overall story. Lucas should have kept to the original plan to use Wookies in that role; it would have made infinitely more sense, and the film would have been much better for it. Additionally, some of the acting (in particular Harrison Ford as Han Solo) feels very phoned-in, and the character development is pretty weak in many cases. Overall, it feels to me kind of like three separate films spliced together (Tatooine + Dagoba + Endor). Which is not all to say that I do not like Return of the Jedi. It just could have been a lot better, for a few changes.

The 2004 version is a further-tweaked edit of the late-90s Special Edition. Basically, there is a new Jabba's palace dance sequence, a different celebration montage at the end, various new elements and small changes here and there, and Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker at the end. Almost all of the changes are, in my opinion, horribly ill-advised. Additionally, some of the CGI effects are appallingly cheap looking.

The other thing of note is the commentary track on the 2004 version. It features Lucas, Carrie Fisher, a visual FX guy, and an audio FX guy. Most of the talking is done by Lucas and the audio guy. I say, give Carrie Fisher her own commentary track; she is genuinely entertaining, and especially on a film like Return of the Jedi, her humor almost makes the silliness seem okay.",1348185600,,2316,4.64390243902439

2202319,4,B00076SCPW,"2007 DVD version of the concluding episode of one of the most popular star opera series has some added or altered scenes not in the original theatrical release in 1983.

Although this one is the last of the original Luke trilogy I am not that impressed with this compared with the previous episode THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, or fourth episode THE NEW HOPE, the originally the first Star Wars series. This episode is made up of four parts: Rescue Mission of Han Solo, Luke's Return to Dagobah system, Endor Mission to inactivate the barrier system of Death Star #2, Luke's own mission to face Darth Vader and evil Emperor. Now let's see how each part is done.

1. Mission to Save Incarbonated Han Solo...4.5 out of 5
This part was done really brilliantly, it is seen from the eyes of the C-3PO and R2D2, even the viewers are not aware of what the Luke's plan is all about. Really thrilling and monsters as well as Java The Hut, Boba Fett were done quite well. I love Princess Leia in metal bathing suit.

2. Luke Returns to Dagobah System...3 out of 5
Although it is really touching scene involving the new revelation about the ""other hope"" and the death of Yoda, this scene could have been better. It is sad and unfortunate to see that Yoda passes away. It seems that Lucas team has little idea what conquering the dark side of the force really means when the movie was made. The original plot was far too simple and the dark forces merely meant Luke's inner weakness which is in the way for eliminating the evil. The viewers who started seeing the SW through Anakin Trilogy in particular may feel it should not be like this. Yoda should have warned Luke that dark force would not simply go away just by eliminating the emperor and darth vader's dark side.

3. Endor Mission...4 out of 5
Ironically the best part of Endor mission scene is speeder racing. It really is thrilling to us even today's viewers accustomed to CG-generated scenes. But after Ewok appear the story become a bit slack. I do not see if Ewok characters fit in the Star Wars universe well. Maybe the fantasy movies such as Caravan of Courage may better do this adorable creature justice rather than being in a part of Star Wars battle scenes. Imperial troopers look really dumb by easily entrapped by Ewoks. Last celebration scene addition was minor improvement. Without it, it looks just the victory of the local battle.

4. Luke's Own Mission to Conquer the dark Force...4 out of 5
Despite the insufficient Dagobah scene, this final battle was done quite well. Particularly the scene that Father and Son got strongly spiritually reunited is really touching. It's good in a stand-alone episode. As the initial title was ""Revenge of the Jedi"" the producers might not have been aware of how strong the dark side of the force could be.

Verdict: Good to see the grand finale but some parts seem hasty and insufficient.

The DVD is in great condition, it arrived in a timely manner, and it's the action packed, innovative special effects filled, wonderful sci-fi story expected.
  Due to my inept ordering, it was the Full Screen Version! NOT widescreen! Not the special two disc DVD package with both the remastered, enhanced verson, and the original theatrical release version. (Yes I know there's an even newer pacakging available. It took me long enough to go with this one. But I'll move on up to that one soon enough)
  First off, I'm a widescreen fan, I want the full view of everything, the detailed sets, all encompassing veiws of the action, effect of panoramic views, etc. No pan and scan for me, if there is camera motion I feel it should be as a necessary dramatic component of the action and story of a movie, not to quickly show some otherwise missed visual aspect of the story that would was included in the original frame.
  The movie is still incredible, I still love it. Even in fullscreen version. Even with those annoying Ewoks! Alright, alright, they do save the day in the battle of Endor, They are cute and cuddley, but everybody seems to forget........they were going to eat Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie for dinner!!! I would have never turned my back on one of those things, ever. Don't care how cute and cuddlely they are.
  And liking the Star Wars saga as I do, being able to watch one version, then the other and compare, especially with other SW fans (who else would sit thru two viewings of the same movie at one session?) is a fun thing to do.
  Like I say, it was my blunder when I ordered. Didn't pay attention, must have clicked on the wrong one. Learn you must, from my mistake. Use the Force. Select the good DVD package.  (Or that new one if you must)",1333152000,,1899,4.459537572254336
2202323,5,B00076SCPW,"Finally after waiting many countless years, Mr. Lucas decides to release the Original Theatrical Star Wars edition. The first disc is basically the CGI enhanced effects. The final of the original trilogy and the fall of the empire. This was considered one of the weakest in the series but its my personal favourite out of the series. The emperor makes a trap to finish of the rebellion. Luke heads back home to rescue his friend Han Solo. Luke finds out he kissed his sister and a great and i mean great Climax between Vader and the Emperor. Anyway most people bought this DVD for the 2nd disc which is the Theatrical version. Many people will ask why is Lucas after shunning the fans for so long now decided to release the theatrical versions? The reason was piracy. People were making money of the theatrical versions but coping them and posting them on-line and burning DVD copies to sell them. Most of copies that were being sold were the 1993 Definitive Editions. And the mastermind of all Star Wars decided it was time to release them on DVD. Lucas didn't want to do anything special for the Theatrical versions so he went to his personal collections of his Star Wars Home Media materials and chose to copy his own copy of the 1993 Star Wars Definitive Edition on LaserDisc.  Its nothing but a simple LaserDisc transfer. So Basically he did this to cash on the Piracy sellers while selling it for a higher price. Most people will complain that the movie is on LetterBox format which is a big thumbs down. But it didn't make a difference to me or my tv. Anyway Image quality is not bad compared to my own transfers to DVD. Image Quality i would rate 9 out of 10. Sound quality is 10 out of 10 even though its only 2.0 Digital Audio.

2202326,3,B00076SCPW,"1983's 'Return of the Jedi' is considered by most to be the weakest of the original trilogy. The main reason for this is obvious. It begins with an E and ends in K, and has a W and an O in between. Lucas's marketing savvy kicked in early this time and he took out the original woodland creatures, the ""Wookies"" and replaced them with the teddy-bear-like ""Ewoks"" and the rest is history. The Ewoks may appeal to some people...notably mothers, very small children and the mentally challenged, but to most 'Star Wars' fans, it remains but a wonder at how much cooler ""Return of the Jedi"" would have been if the Wookies had not been excised.

The Ewoks aren't the only problem 'Return of the Jedi' has though. The story, again, isn't that full (once the characters are banded together, it becomes essentially a re-run of the fist film), the acting isn't terribly good (with Ford, especially, going through the motions) and the direction is a little lackluster (this time handled by Richard Marqand). But, despite these drawbacks, there is actually a lot to enjoy here. The opening ""Jabba's Palace / Scarlacc"" sequence is fantastic and handled brilliantly, in spite of being marred somewhat by an absolutely awful and completely unnecessary musical number. Which is rendered even MORE unbearable by the inclusion of an ""improved"" musical number in the Special Edition. Thankfully, Jabba himself was left untouched and is all the better for it. The giant puppet is a thousand times more lifelike than the pathetic CGI attempt in the 'Star Wars' Special Edition and he's lost none of his disgusting fascination. Likewise, the ""Arrival of the Emperor"" scene is done very well too, with a thumping ""Empire March"" music piece from John Williams and Ian McDiarmid standing out as Darth Vader's handler. The brilliant ""speeder-bike"" chase sequence too is worthy of note, although the effects for that are starting to show their age. The epic space battle at the end, though, is still incredible.

However, shortly after the ""speeder-bikes"" sequence, we get to the teddy bears and the film never goes off the cliff, it does fo rapidly downhill from there. The problem with the Ewoks, is that it's impossible not to be cynical about them. They're a money generator and the focus of cheap emotion, ""aww...the teddy's cute"", ""aww...the teddy's dead"". Even as a child, I wanted the Empire to massacre them. Strangely enough, the word ""Ewok"" isn't mentioned in the entire film, yet it became a household name.

In addition, the final defeat of the Empire forces at the hands of the teddy bears is almost unbearably absurd! It's impossible to believe, even in the realms of a fantasy universe that the Emperor's ""crack troops"" would succumb to a bunch of koalas. It totally takes the viewer out of the piece. Not only that, but with the Special Edition, Lucas saw fit to take out the ""Nub Yub"" celebration song at the end of the film and replace it with a montage of victory celebrations across multiple worlds throughout the Galaxy! This destroys the impression that the ""Battle of Endor"" was a significant, but local victory, and turns it into a Galaxy-wide collapse of the Empire! Just because they lost their second unfinished Death Star and the First and Second in command were killed, it hardly makes sense that the whole of the Empire would disintegrate immediately afterwards.

Either way, 'Return of the Jedi' is still a very enjoyable chapter in the original 'Star Wars' trilogy and a fitting entry in its own right. But its shortcomings display, all too clearly, George Lucas's extreme limitations. Lucas may have fantastic ideas, but without a steadying hand (Gary Kurtz?), his unhindered execution of those ideas can be detrimental to the whole project. When viewing 'Return of the Jedi', in which Lucas had more direct control over than the previous two films, it becomes easy to see the oncoming train wreck that the prequels turned out to be. Perhaps the elimination of Gary Kurtz from the production crew, after he voiced his displeasure over some of Lucas's decisions, was the tipping point for George Lucas and the 'Star Wars' saga. Because, as we have seen with the prequels, George Lucas (and his appalling little sycophant Rick McCallum) have well and truly gone over to the ""Dark Side"".

2202327,4,B00076SCPW,"This review is for the two-disc, Limited Edition, widescreen edition of Star Wars Episode VI.  The set includes both the original and ""enhanced"" theatrical releases of this sci-fi classic.  The enhanced theatrical version is on Disc #1 and original version is provided on Disc #2, the bonus disc.  Both versions are presented in a letter-boxed format, which I prefer because the entire scene is preserved.  The soundtrack and video quality on Disc #1 are first-rate.  The aspect ratio displayed on my 65"" TV is 2.35:1.

The ""original"" version on Disc #2 is a disappointment.  The video quality is poor by comparison - the star images are blurry and the overall appearance is very grainy.  I suspect that this was a video transfer, as opposed to a remastered edition.  I measured the aspect ratio at 3:1, which I found unusual.

We've got Billy Dee Williams' charm and Mark Hamill's aw-shucks demeanor - though I admit Carrie Fisher's metal bikini kind of makes me cringe (ouch! - that thing can't be comfortable).

The gang head off to the planet Endor where they befriend a tribe of teddy bear-like humanoids called Ewoks where they help them fight against the empire but can Luke confront his father and learn other secrets of his past?

A brilliant final installment of the electrifying Star Wars saga and it went out with a bang on this one. Directed by Richard Marquand (The original director was going to be David Lynch) and written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas with a story from Lucas, this one has been considered the weakest of the classic SW trilogy and i don't see how.

2202336,3,B00076SCPW,"This is not a bad movie.  This is a pretty good movie.  It simply is not that great.  It falls short of the two movies preceding it.  For one thing, it doesn't take itself as seriously as the Empire Strikes Back did.  It can be a little silly in parts.  And it is more of a popcorn action movie, whereas the first two had some pretty heavy adult themes.  Empire contains possibly the most shocking plot twist of all time, when Vader reveals that he is Luke's father.  The plot of this movie is very predictable.  There was not anything new or surprising.  This is nowhere near as bad as the Star Wars we saw in 1999, 2002, or 2003.  But it is still very disappointing.

The opening scene shows the Empire building a second Death Star.  Why did they do the Death Star over again?  Could they not come up with any new ideas?  Vader's entrance was excellent, but then we cut to Tattooine.  For the next half hour.  I liked how they gave each major character a cool entrance scene, but the rescue on Tatooine took way too long.  I guess they had to take time to establish Jabba as a character, so when he died it meant something.  The Rancor scene was silly.  Luke is a Jedi.  He doesn't use the Force to kill the thing.  He fights the Rancor with a bone, and then drops a door on its head.  The fact that he's a Jedi didn't really matter.  And the fight at the Sarlacc pit is okay, but Luke becomes too much of an action hero.  Whereas in Empire, the measure of how great a Jedi you were was who you were as a person, in this and the prequels the force is just superpowers and martial arts.  The fact that the action scenes are good doesn't change this.

Next, we meet the Emperor.  He isn't bad, but he is nowhere near as interesting as Vader.  He reminds me of one of those evil mad scientists with a death ray.  It was a shame for Vader to have to take a backseat to him in this movie.  Yoda's death scene is probably the best thing about this movie.  It is well written, and the subsequent conversation with Obi-Wan is very intriguing.  But the rest of the movie is a big action scene.  The speeder bike chase was very good.  But after that, we should have gotten a story.  Instead, we meet the Ewoks, little teddy bears.  They are ultimately the ones who defeat the Empire, which has taken over the entire Galaxy, killing off the Jedi order in the process.  In the original script, the Ewoks were Wookies.  I think it would have been cool to see a technologically advanced army be outsmarted by an army with primitive weapons, but this was just silly.  The confrontation with Vader was pretty good, but Vader turning good was too predictable.  And the Emperor, who tells Luke to kill Vader, does not see it coming.  A better ending would have been for Luke to have no choice but to kill Vader, as he is too corrupted by the dark side.  One problem I have with this movie is the fact that Luke, the main protagonist, doesn't really do anything of importance, other than rescue Han Solo.  He is able to help Vader renounce the dark side, but Vader dies five minutes later, so that was a little pointless.  Vader kills the Emperor, but the Death Star blew up five minutes later, which means the Emperor would have died then if he hadn't fallen down the bottomless pit shaft thing.

The first Star Wars was a good action movie, and one of the first movies in a while that was actually fun to watch.  The Empire Strikes Back was much darker, and is widely considered to be the best Star Wars movie, and possibly the best Science Fiction movie of all time.  Why did they make this just another fun romp?  The original draft was much darker, and killed off Han Solo.  Lucas decided not to kill any major characters, because he thought it would affect his toy sales.  This is where the Star Wars series took a turn for the worst.  This movie itself was not terrible, but it is definitely a disappointment when compared with its predecessors.",1288051200,,3935,4.32054794520548
2202337,3,B00076SCPW,"First of all, all of these special editions are a disservice to the original movies.  George Lucas did not direct ESB or ROTJ - why would he mess with movies he did not direct?  The second disk with the original release was intentionally made to look bad, with no attempt to clean it up to get it to normal DVD standards.  It's pretty pathetic that George Lucas keeps messing with his own movies and alienating fans that grew up enjoying the original releases.

After the first two incredible movies in the classic trilogy, Return of the Jedi is the weakest by far (and also an indicator of things to come with the prequels).  Most of this movie I can't bear to watch any longer and stick with the action scenes only; this is a severely flawed movie in the long run.  After the success of the last two movies, George Lucas was now able to have free reign in what he did, without the checks and balances that were in place previously to minimize his eccentricities; the Star Wars universe now had an added dimension of silliness and bad dialogue.  The director was not the right fit for this movie either especially after the great job that Irvin Kershner did with ESB.  The opening sequence is well done with Vader's approach to the Death Star, but I'm not sure regurgitating the Death Star was necessary.  The dialogue in the majority of the movie that begins with Vader's demand for increased production is weak.  Ok, so the Emperor is coming - it's about time his character is introduced in the flesh.  Then comes the whole Jabba's palace sequence which is poorly done and just plain silly; it's made even worse in the special edition.  The highlights are Han being freed from the carbonite and Luke's arrival which displays his maturity and development as a Jedi Knight.  However, the ensuing scene with the Rancor is cheesy and needless.  The movie finally gets going with the battle scene and Luke showing off his Jedi skills with his new green lightsaber (the trailers deliberately colored his lightsaber blue to ""surprise"" the audience when the movie premiered).  Boba Fett is killed off way too easy, and the whole scene with Lando, Han, and Chewie is terrible.  A lot of the movie is just hard to take seriously.  The Emperor arrives and he is really does not live up to the hype, then Yoda dies and you can barely understand him.  Obi-Wan explains Anakin's back story which is later completely contradicted by the prequels.  Everyone is buddies now and Han is appointed as a ""General"" and wants Lando to use the Millennium Falcon.  The premise of all these promotions to ""General"" for Lando and Han is ridiculous.  After having no rank, they are immediately Generals?  How about commanders at least of their particular operations?  The sequence of Han, Leia, and Luke's team in the Imperial Shuttle arriving at Endor was well done with Vader sensing Luke's presence.  Then we see that the Emperor enjoys messing with Vader and basically treats him like a step-child instead of the high status that we thought he had.  Then there is the speeder bike chase which has its moments and its silliness.  Han's hand to hand combat with the biker scout he first encounters is a joke.  The arrival of the Ewoks pretty much destroys the majority of what credibility the movie had.  A prolonged sequence with the Ewoks and the rebels ensues which is nearly unbearable to watch, then Luke tells Leia about their origin, and the scene where Luke confronts Vader is well done (although Vader conveying that ""Obi Wan once thought as you do"" is completely contradicted by the prequels unfortunately).  I'm not sure why Luke was convinced that Vader was going to come around after their talk and why Luke's skills are complete just because he made a new lightsaber?  The goofy interaction with the Ewoks and battle on Endor is far from credible - supposedly a legion of the Emperor's best troops and the armored stormtroopers are easily outwitted and outfought by a bunch of teddy bears.  The Emperor goads Luke to give in to the dark side, but never has a convincing argument.  The trap he sets for Lando's space assault sets him off and the battle begins with Luke and Vader.  However, the Emperor won't shut up and Luke keeps hesitating to fight his father.  The majority of the space battle scenes are entertaining, but once the Death Star begins firing, the rebel forces are clearly overmatched.  The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is overall pretty cool, especially when Vader finally makes Luke snap and go off on him.  Then the Emperor won't shut his trap again and Luke gathers his resolve.  Vader finds redemption by finally turning against the Emperor and ""giving him the shaft"".  Luke's victory to save his father from the dark side is pretty cool, especially after seeing the prequels.  Then we have another Death Star explosion and happy days are here again.  The special edition did one thing right by changing the music in the closing scene and the scenes of celebration across the galaxy are kind of cool, but now adding Hayden Christensen's head to old Anakin's body is absolutely ridiculous.

Return of the Jedi has its moments, but after such a great movie in ESB, it fails in many ways and is too silly and childish especially given some really dark themes and situations.

2202339,4,B00076SCPW,"I've always felt Return Of The Jedi (1983) is the weakest of the three original Star Wars movies from the first trilogy, though it's a great movie.  I have to rank one of the three movies in third place, so this is the one that's third.  I have the 2004 enhanced edition of this movie with added scenes and some minor and major changes made to already existing scenes, so I'll be reviewing this version.

I want to start with some observations and opinions about the opening sequence in Jabba The Hutt's palace.  First of all, the entire scene with the music and dancing was changed DRAMATICALLY and for the WORSE.  The music is entirely different and not as good, in my opinion.  Lots of additional creatures/characters were added, and some were CGI creatures that seemed like they would fit in more with Episode I - The Phantom Menace.  Back in 1983 George Lucas started getting carried away with the quantity and diversity of his creature creations.  Compared to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, the creatures in Return Of The Jedi suddenly became a little more puppet-like, visually colorful, and child-like.  A New Hope had a smaller budget than The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, so it prevented George Lucas from making the cantina sequence at Mos Eisley the way he originally envisioned it to be.  So, with a larger budget in 1983, he was able to put lots of the above described creatures in Jabba's palace to kind of make up for the cantina sequence in A New Hope that was not to his liking.  The scene in Return Of The Jedi was in Jabba's palace instead of the cantina, but it was on Tatooine, bottom line.  But the problem here is that in this 2004 enhanced version Jabba's palace was even MORE littered with various creatures/characters, including CGI creatures.

Return Of The Jedi is a great movie, but I rank it in fifth place out of the six movies.  It ranks above The Phantom Menace and below Attack Of The Clones.

I own the 4-DVD Trilogy set that includes the DVD of bonus material.  On this DVD, Harrison Ford said that he told George Lucas before Return Of The Jedi was made that he felt that Han Solo should be killed off in Return Of The Jedi.  He gave his reasons (he has no mom, no pop, and no real connection to the rest of the story).  I'm with Harrison Ford on this one.  It wouldn't have been such a bad thing if Han Solo was bumped off in this movie.  If he had been killed off early in the movie, it would make the viewer start to worry about the other characters.  Instead, who dies in this movie who's part of the rebellion?  Yoda!  I didn't like seeing this, though I understand it fully and how it is important to the rest of the story.

I really didn't care for the Ewoks.  Never have.  They're OK, but a little too child-like.

Chewie looks like a Yorkie at times in this movie.  That's not a bad thing at all.

Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine was AWESOME.  My favorite character in the whole six-movie series.  I like the fact that McDiarmid is a dual character during the prequels - the Chancellor and Darth Sidious.  He has two sides to him and leads a secret life.

After the light sabre fight with Vader, Luke is on the ground receiving lightning bolts from the Emperor.  It looks like Luke is in such great pain and agony during this scene.  After Vader lifts up the Emperor and gets rid of him, Luke calmly gets up off the ground and seems to be just fine, like the lightning bolts were no big deal.  Huh?  Vader was so concerned about his son being electrocuted that he killed the Emperor.  Then Luke is just A-OK.  I guess the Emperor's lightning bolts weren't so lethal afterall.

Why is a 30-year-old Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen's) ghost at the end of the movie?  It should be a 50-year-old Anakin Skywalker's (Sebastian Shaw's) image instead because 50-year-old Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader died in Return Of The Jedi, not a 30-year-old Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Christensen.  Besides, Luke never saw a 30-year-old Anakin Skywalker in episodes IV, V, and VI.  Instead, he saw a 50-year-old Anakin Skywalker after he unmasked Darth Vader, so how can Luke even recognize Hayden Christensen at the end of the movie?

The music in this ending sequence is different than the original 1983 movie, but it doesn't bother me.

I like this movie overall, both the 1983 and 2004 versions.  This 2004 version has a lot of good scenes that were added along with some already existing scenes that were altered.  Watch to find out what they were.

Overall, I recommend this classic Star Wars flick.",1282867200,,4574,4.541003671970624

The fact that he used Christiansen instead, really lowers my respect for Lucas himself.

2202341,5,B00076SCPW,"""Return of the Jedi"" is the third film in the Star Wars trilogy. In this movie the Empire is building a new Death Star and through informers the Rebels have found out how to destroy it. The Rebels decide to send a team out to destroy a machine on the forest moon of Endor that provides a force field for the Death Star in construction. Once the force field is gone Rebel ships will enter the Death Star and destroy its core thereby destroying the Death Star also.

The movie has a lot of comedy and is not as dramatic as the second movie. It does have drama though in the part where Luke Skywalker meets the Emperor and has a lightsaber fight with Darth Vader. Like the first movie it has a grand space battle around the Death Star. It also has a cool speederbike chase on the forest moon of Endor.

One interesting part of the movie was where the main characters meet the Ewoks. Some people hate that part. I liked it. I thought the Ewoks were cute. The Ewok character Wicket later appeared in two Ewok movies made for television. The actor who played him, Warwick Davis, later played the main character in the fantasy film ""Willow"".

All in all, this Star Wars film is not as memorable as the first two but it's still good. Its more aimed at a kid audience than Empire Strikes Back and when I was a kid I like ""Return of the Jedi"" better than the first Star Wars.",1276214400,,1365,4.262548262548263

Luke (who gets a new colored lightsaber) and friends rescue Han from Jabba, Yoda reveals to Luke that there's another Skywalker (Leia) and the Emperor finally shows his face. The Emperor really is (next to the Joker and Vader) one of the greatest cinematic villains. Why? I'll reveal that when I get to Episode III. The only other new introductions to the franchise is the toy marketable Ewoks, who I'll never understand how they could take down the Empire's best (though then again, weren't we more technologically advanced than the Vietnamese yet they kicked our butts because they knew the terrain?). And fan favorite Admiral Ackbar, who utters one of my favorite lines from any film (It's a trap!) The effects and models are second to none (even by Lucas' CGI standards). With so many ships during the attack on the Death Star, you forget that they're models. ILM came a long way from the rather static, though impressive, movements from the first film. The speeder chase, again, is one of my favorite sequences from the films because, like the space fight, you forget about all the technical stuff as it blends so well into the film. And the lightsaber duel is one of the most emotional, like the duels in Ep. III, as father and son duel to the death, to the amusement of the Emperor. And Williams, who I've run out of adjectives with which to describe him, has another rousing score.

Even with the zoom in effect, the picture is crystal clear and the color great. I'm using an upconvert DVD player with HDMI output (1080p), and a 50-inch plasma HD television.

The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.

None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.

Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.

The original version is the better version.

Here, Luke finally gets to learn what he needs to know, in order to master the Force.  Then, he goes out and battles the Empire, with an ending that was very unexpected at the time.

I will not be reviewing the second trilogy that followed.  I consider it to be far inferior to the original trilogy of the original Star Wars movies.

2202356,4,B00076SCPW,"RETURN OF THE JEDI was the STAR WARS film which thrilled me most as a kid.  I loved the ewoks, though now I find them to be a bit irritating.  I loved the scenes in Jabba's palace, though now I think the use of Jim Henson's Creature Workshop was a bit over the top.  I loved and still love the fast paced action sequences and the climactic lightsaber duel at the end.  Looking back, I now prefer EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, A NEW HOPE, and even REVENGE OF THE SITH to this one.  But JEDI still ranks high in my book, if for no other reason, it was just downright fun.  And it still is.

The Special Edition of this film did little more than bog it down with a lot of useless junk.  I refer primarily to the musical (using that word rather loosely) interlude in Jabba's palace.  I'm sure I laughed at it first time I saw it in theaters in 1997, but since then only irritated feelings have I felt for that scene.  The celebration scenes at the end were fine, but I don't think anyone ever missed their absence.  Superimposing Hayden Christensen's image in ""spirit"" next to Alec Guiness and Yoda at the end seemed to me rather bizarre.  Luke ""saved"" his father.  When this happened his father did not bear Hayden Christensen's image but that of actor Sebastian Shaw.  So why do we see a young Anakin at the end of the film instead of the old, dying man who got ""redeemed""?

2202364,2,B00076SCPW,"First let me begin by saying that I love this movie. Along with New Hope and Empire, it is a cherished part of my childhood that I still cherish and enjoy more than twenty years later. Sure Empire (my favorite) is better, and sure the Ewoks can be a little silly, but on the whole the film is immensely enjoyable and does a great job of bringing to a close the greatest ever film trilogy. In particular, the scenes in Jabba's palace and the action sequence during the escape at the Sarlacc pit are awesome, and the confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor are among the most dramatic and atmospheric in the entire trilogy.

Unfortunately, this film has also suffered the most from Lucas' constant meddling. I am not opposed to minor additions that improve the cinematic experience, i.e. the improved special effects during the destruction of the Death Stars, or the detailed, three dimensional close-ups of X-Wings drifting by in space, and especially the overall digital remastering which makes the films look larger than life on screen. But there are other additions that call attention to themselves and look out of place, such as the ridiculous scene with Han and Jabba or the CGI addition of alien beasts at Mos Eisley in Episode IV. One of the many things that made the original trilogy so superior to its prequels was its tangibility, the fact that what you are watching is real for the most part, even when they are using models and trick photography. Using today's technology to insert CGI aliens into the original is intrusive and very noticeable. They all seem to stand out from their backgrounds.

There were a few additions in ""Return"" which I didn't appreciate. One was the venus fly trap-like addition to the Sarlacc pit, which I thought was unnecessary but I suppose can be tolerated. I also don't like seeing Old Anakin being replaced by Young Anakin standing next to Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end. Should Anakin look as he did when he died, or as he did when he was last a Jedi? I would prefer to see the old Anakin, because seeing Hayden Christensen is a reminder of his terrible performance and the other terrible trilogy (on another level, I don't think Anakin, who murdered billions, should be allowed to stand next to them at all, but what's done is done).

Also, the song at the end of the film, the ""Ewok Song"" has been replaced with what some would consider a more palateable song, accompanied by CGI images of worlds around the galaxy celebrating the death of the Emperor. Some may diagree with me, but I preferred the old song, not only because I like it better, but because it's the song that closes out the entire trilogy. That alone makes it one of the most memorable songs in the trilogy, and those who watched the trilogy growing up remember seeing the entire cast gather together for one last shot with that song playing in the background. For better or worse (I think better), it should have remained.

But by far the worst of these additions is the new song inserted into the scene at Jabba's palace. Why, oh why, did George feel the need to change this, and if he absolutey had to change it, how could he do such a terrible job? I thought the old music was cool! In its place is a ridculous, annoying, cheesy, cartoonish musical number that sounds wildly out of place, sung by new CGI aliens that look wildly out of place in their surroundings and look like they were taken from a Disney Pixar movie. The fact that George thought that this was an improvement does not speak well for him (neither do Episodes 1-3), and the fact that he thought that we the fans would think likewise is downright insulting, not only as Star Wars purists but as people!!

This is the kind of meddling that makes Star Wars fans yearn for the original theatrical versions. For these, all Lucas would have had to do was digitally remaster the originals and give them an anamorphic widescreen transfer, which was probably done for Weekend At Bernie's 2 and Ernest Goes To Camp, but is apparently too much for the most popular film trilogy ever made. It seems that George has added insult to insult by offering substandard versions that seem to say ""So your not happy with my versions? You wanna buy the laser-disc versions? Here you go. Choke on 'em."" How else to explain? Why go through the effort of releasing them if you're not going to offer a quality product? Now you've released them, printed who knows how many, packaged them with who knows how many copies of the Special Edition, and all you've done is anger your fans and rip them off.

2202369,4,B00076SCPW,"Great movie overall, especially the chase through the death star's interior. That sequence is amazing! But there are little details that bother me each time I see this.
1) Rebel ships seem to multiply.. when the Rebel fleet first goes into hyperspace to get to the death star, there are fewer ships than there are when they fly away from the death star just before it explodes. Also, no matter how many Rebel fighters get blown up, there are always dozens more in the background. Where are these replacements coming from?
2) Star Destroyers are tougher than that.. they are supposed to be super heavily armed and armored, yet one tiny fighter crashing into the bridge takes out the mighty super star destroyer, and meanwhile a few shots from passing Rebel ships is all it takes to blow up a regular star destroyer.
3) On Endor, the ""legion of the best troops"" of the Empire still can't shoot straight. Most Imperial shots miss the Rebels, while Han just picks off the stormtroopers one after another.
4) On the death star, Luke chucks away his lightsaber and taunts the emperor..""I'll never turn to the dark side."" And just stands there, waiting for the emperor to shake his hand and say ""ok, I can respect that."" You think maybe in all that training, Yoda could have warned him.. ""Luke, watch out for the emperor, he shoots lightning from his hands, whatever you do, DON'T throw away your only defense in front of him!""
Also I wonder, if Vader had lived and made it back to Endor with Luke, would there have been some awkward moments with Han and Leia? ""Umm, sorry about capturing and torturing both of you.. no hard feelings.. so.. can I be best man at the wedding?""

So if you've still got an old 4:3 ratio TV this will be OK (and thats all), but for those of us with widescreen TV's this means you either have to watch a tiny 4:3 image or use your TV's zoom facility to get the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. However if you do this you are reducing the image quality.

Sorry to inform ya, Darth, but the cirle was made incomplete the moment you killed Obi-Wan. Well okay so technically THAT circle was complete. But you started a new circle and that one must be completed here in Episode Six. (Am I talking in Circles or is it just me?)

Seriously though, this movie completes a new phase in Darth Vader's development. First he had to learn about the force. Then he had to learn the WAYS of the Force. Then he had to be turned to the Dark Side of the Force. Then he had to become a MASTER of Evil. Then he had to destroy all that was good. Ultimately, he had to be destroyed by the very thing he failed to destroy. The power of Good.

That's a very simplistic summation of this movie, but it's accurate nonetheless. The movie is very well done and brings this part of the saga to a very satisfying close. I am very sad that we never get to see an Episode 7, 8 and 9 where Luke now starts a ""next phase"" in his Jedi development, but I still have hopes that someday this wonderful story will be revived on the screen as it has been continued in the many books that have been written.

THe original special effects do stand the test of time in my opinion and look more authentic then the CGI. the CGI mixed in with the hand made models they used in the trilogies look off.. Anybody with a keen eye can see the differences.. As far as return of the Jedi goes, not much notible CGI aside from the celebration scene but, the main notable scene which i think is completely stupid is redoing annikan's ghost as the young prequal annikan then the middle age annikan as in the original star wars.. What doesnt make sense is why Obi is old and annikan is young as a ghost.. I think if they kept it as it was in the originals of annikan being middle aged, people would have just assumed that it was him at his current age had his physical body not been in that deteriorated state when he was in the Darth vader outfit..

2202381,2,B00076SCPW,"I agree with any of a number of previous reviewers: Would somebody PLEASE take STAR WARS away from George Lucas before he ruins it completely?

Like Francis Ford Coppola, who messed with THE GODFATHER trilogy over and over again trying to ""perfect"" it, Lucas keeps coming back to the original STAR WARS trilogy and adding enhanced effects and formerly deleted scenes.

In what is now known as STAR WARS EPISODE VI: THE RETURN OF THE JEDI, (let me catch my breath a minute, please), Lucas decided to ""enhance"" the film by inserting extra scenes and dialogue. Lucas decided to make the battle scene explosions more ""dramatic,"" do a score of other little tweaks, and clean up the print.

Lucas has done this so many times over the past three decades that it's now impossible to figure out which film is the ""real"" THE RETURN OF THE JEDI. Of all the questionable ""improvements"" he's made, cleaning up the print is the only worthwhile effort. Most of the added scenes and lines add nothing to the film, and some of the changes actually degrade the movie. At the very end, Lucas chose to insert a whole sequence of CGI planetary capitals celebrating the fall of the Galactic Empire, an artificial-looking addition that was hardly worth the effort. Far more annoying is the eleventh hour closing scene replacement of the spirit of Anakin Skywalker (originally David Prowse) with the twentysomething Hayden Christensen, who played Anakin in Episodes II and III. Standing next to the glowing green Yoda and the elder Obi-Wan (Sir Alec Guinness), Christensen's Anakin looks like a Yuppie punk wrapped in a bedsheet.

Fortunately, this two-disc set contains the original theatrical release with all the nicks and imperfections it was born with. The print's a bit dim, and the special effects are showing their limitations after twenty-four years, but this is THE RETURN OF THE JEDI that will remain THE RETURN OF THE JEDI. It is what it is, and it never needed changes. Given the immense amount of material that has grown up around STAR WARS since it was first released, Lucas would have been smarter to release one or the other or both versions as he did, but added an Extras disc with all kinds of ""The Making Of.."" and ""The Legacy Of..."" goodies. I was disappointed that this isn't that set.

I was twenty-three when THE RETURN OF THE JEDI debuted in 1983, a full six years after STAR WARS. It was a long time to wait for the cycle to end, and the rumors of a second trilogy (and a possible third trilogy) went unanswered for an unconscionably long time.

I never became a ""Jedihead"" (the original tag for the STAR WARS version of a Trekkie), but THE RETURN OF THE JEDI, while not as good as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, was an eagerly awaited coda to the tale.

The STAR WARS films are not CITIZEN KANE IN OUTER SPACE. Overall, they are not ""great"" films, but they are true ""classics."" THE RETURN OF THE JEDI is a crucial part of the cycle, and does entertain and excite, all the true bases of success and the core of meaningfulness for any story.

The STAR WARS universe is clearly derivative. THE LORD OF THE RINGS has a ""Dark Lord"" and a RETURN OF THE KING. STAR WARS has a ""Dark Lord of the Sith"" and a RETURN OF THE JEDI. Lightsabers are yet another nod to the film's Sword & Sorcery roots. STAR WARS' ""Corellians"" appear in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION as ""Korellians"", and ""Han Solo"" is also there as ""Hari Seldon."" The space war elements are a mishmash of STAR TREK, FORBIDDEN PLANET, AMAZING STORIES, pulp fiction, and a hundred other sources. George Lucas was able to take these well-used pieces and combine them into something that is both very original and yet archetypal.

THE RETURN OF THE JEDI closes the sci-fi retelling of the Mythos of the young Hero. Having faced his demons in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and suffered traumatic, life-altering injury and loss as well as the acquisition of his unique Secret Knowledge, Luke Skywalker has grown into a powerful Jedi. By the time of THE RETURN OF THE JEDI it is becoming clear that Luke has transcended the seductions of the Dark Side, and is now using his powers for unselfish purposes, including perhaps most profoundly, the redemption of his own father, Darth Vader.

Nevertheless, one challenge remains. When Vader discovers Leia's existence, he declares Luke a supernumerary and decides to turn Leia to the Dark Side. The ensuing lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke for Leia's soul is the most profound and most critical moment in the entire sextology. Luke's positive urge to protect his sister meshes with the negative rage he feels at his father's betrayal. Luke Skywalker never comes closer to the Dark Side than at that moment when he maims his father and has the defeated, clearly weakened Vader at his feet. His decision to toss away his lightsaber and renounce the Dark Side at that moment is not only the key to his own salvation but to that of his father, who is then called upon to act on behalf of all that is good, and does. In doing so, father and son together redeem their entire universe.

While not as complex as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE RETURN OF THE JEDI is a far more sophisticated story than the straight-ahead A NEW HOPE. It brings Lucas' modern myth of the Hero to the only close that it could have. Thank heaven that THE RETURN OF THE JEDI even survives Lucas's post-theatrical obsessive-compulsive changes to remain a modern classic.

This movie is my favorite of the first trilogy (Episodes 4-6; I have yet to see Episodes 1-3).  This borrows some of the elements of Episode 4 (Tatooine, the Death Star) and some of Episode 5 (Yoda for example), and mixes it in with some unique characteristics such as Jabba The Hut, the Emporer, and the Ewoks.

This is a continuation from Episode 5, and some may be lost seeing this first.  However, the introduction and C-3PO's recounting of the story will catch you up.  Some of the movie is answering questions asked by Episode 5 such as:  Is Darth Vader really Luke's father?  Who is ""the other"" mentioned by Yoda to Obiwan Kenobi?  Who will Princess Leia choose between Luke and Han Solo?  And most importantly, who does Chewbacca's hair?  Okay, that last question is left unanswered.

2202412,5,B00076SCPW,"THE MOVIE

""Star Wars - Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" is a fantastic conclusion to one of the greatest film sagas of all time. George Lucas had set a high bar for a sequel after the release of ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back,"" but ""Jedi"" surpasses ""Empire"" in more ways than one. Once again, the actors bring their A-game to the table, giving fantastice performances, and once again adding new dimensions to their characters. Outstanding action sequences, thrilling visual effects, and the redemption of Anakin Skywalker are at the heart of this film, and sends the characters off on a high note!

THE SPECIAL EDITION

As with ""Empire,"" George Lucas made very few changes to ""Jedi."" Most of the changes come at the end of the film. The ending is given a huge makeover. Instead of seeing just the celebration on Endor, we see the end of the Galactic Empire celebrated on Tatooine and Bespin. Here, we also get our first glimpse of the planet Coruscant, which would play a major role in the prequel films. John Williams also composed new music for the celebration sequence, without words. Once again, the changed only heighten the experience.

For the DVD release, a couple of other changes are made. In the sequence of the celebrations across the galaxy, we now see celebrations take place on the planet Naboo, another planet featured prominently in the prequels. But perhaps the biggest change of all was the addition of Hayden Christenen, who is now featured as Anakin Skywalker standing with Obi-Wan and Yoda at the very end, where Luke sees the three of them together. I was deeply concerned at this change, but after seeing it, I was pleased to see that it actually works, and actually makes the ending even more emotional.

THE LIMITED EDITION DVD

When I heard the rumor that Lucas intended to release the 1983 Theatrical Version of the film on DVD, I decided to wait before purchasing the films. And the wait was definitely worth it! Both films feature superb sound and picture quality. And while the extras are light, just the fact that both versions of the film are available makes it more than worth it.

CONCLUSION

The Limited Edition 2-Disc Set of ""Star Wars - Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" is a fantastic release for one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Even if you own the 4-Disc boxed-set, the fact that the original version of the film is available makes it worth buying this edition as well. As a ""Star Wars"" fan, I highly recommend it!

I haven't ever bought a tape or dvd of any of the Star Wars stuff, but was intrigued by the idea of finally being able to see the orginals. The theatrical release on the bonus disc doesn't look too bad--especially at night in a dark room. I have a 26 -inch LCD: it looks fine if I leave it with bars on all four sides, and loses something when I zoom in.

I really enjoyed the commentary on the 2004 SE disc. Carrie had the most interesting things to say, and I was amazed at how much thought and effort the sound guy and the other one put into their work. Lucas was o.k.

Bottom line: If you bought the SE in 2004 and only want the theatrical if it looks great--don't buy this. Perhaps everything in the commentaries is well-known, too, to the real fans.

But if this is the first and last Star Wars purchase that you intend to make--then go for it. I loved seeing the orginal film (and sorry George, but I don't think it would have been half as good without the John Williams score), and I enjoyed the commentaries quite a bit.

One interesting bit of trivia--I think that other than Leia's, the only lines spoken by women in all three films are those of Aunt Beru in the first and a female diplomat of some sort in this one.  The commentaries continue the trend:  men spend lots of time on ""we couldn't do what we wanted"" to justify the changes and take up most of the time, while Carrie's interesting stories about the actual shooting of the film get the short shrift.

2202418,3,B00076SCPW,"""Return of the Jedi"" is a classic, and while it's nice to finally have a theatrical version on DVD, this release seems more like a slap in the face to diehard fans than a worthy treatment.

Those who have the 2004 DVD release of ""Return of the Jedi,"" already own half of this release. The first disc is the beautifully restored but altered ""Super-Special Edition"" of the film. Picture quality is great and it's enhanced for widescreen TVs, but the creatures in Jabba's palace have been 'updated,' and there are bits of needless CGI inserted here and there. Also, the color balance is odd and the restoration left strange color patterns in the background of some scenes. For those who don't have the film memorized, this will probably suffice. But the diehards who wore out their VHS copies are sad to see unneccesary if small alterations made to the film.

For such fans, the ""bonus disc"" is the best part of this set. It is a transfer of the original theatrical version of the film. The disappointing part? The image quality isn't wonderful and the movie has been matted for a standard TV. This makes watching the movie on a widescreen frustrating to say the least.

Lucas says this is your last chance to own the unedited originals, but he said that ten years ago before the ""Special Editions"" were released. I hope these films someday recieve a high quality release in their unaltered forms. The films deserve it and the fans deserve it.",1160006400,,1440,4.661417322834645

Sadly, the picture and sound quality on this is worse than my VHS versions from the 80s. This set is a total rip off and George should be ashamed of himself.",1159833600,,464,4.284090909090909

I was amongst the legions of fans that wanted DVD versions of the movies we saw in the theatres as kids. I even wrote a review on amazon in which I suggested that both editions should be made available to the public. I never expected them to be in the same package, but that is a nice little bonus and I'm grateful.

People here seem to complain alot about release after release of these movies, as well as a lack of Dolby digital 5.1 and no anamorphic wide screen on the originals themselves. Right now I really don't mind because:

1. I waited for something like this to happen, so I am buying the movies on DVD for the first time. Since I already had the older Special Editions on VHS this wait was rather easy.

2. I have not invested in a fancy home theatre set up, I just have the stereo speakers on my TV. (Home theatre set ups keep improving and dropping in price, so I may buy one some day. But I keep finding so many other things I'd rather spend my money on that I haven't gone beyond the basics.)

3. I have no interest in spending thousands of dollars, even hundreds, on a HDTV at this time. So my standard TV does just fine and the anamorphic feature would be wasted on it. (Yes, I know that standard signals are going to be cut off 12/31/09, but I'll do fine without them. Who knows, I might even read a few more books next year instead.)

If I ever get a fancy home set up (highly doubtful), then I may miss all of these features. But until then I am very grateful for a chance to relive some childhood memories.",1159833600,,1618,4.156549520766773

That was it?  Harrison I know he most likely would not be interested, but where is Mark?  Was he too busy?  Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, anyone else?  No John Williams?

2202425,2,B00076SCPW,"Watching the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD is like travelling back in time - not so much to the innocence of youth but more to the days when picture quality was never much of a consideration on video releases and Fox had the reputation for the worst transfers in the business. Watching the new DVDs is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining ""See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?""

Return of the Jedi isn't as bad as the scarred memories of working at a movie theatre showing it five times a day for 12 weeks would have it, but it's still the least of the series. With no producer or studio to rein him in this time, Lucas offers something that's little more than a rehash of the first two films, but with bigger Death Stars, more spaceships, more teddy bears and far, far too many Muppets. It's crippled by an atrocious opening section where one after another the heroes try to rescue Han Solo only to get captured in the most tedious ways possible. Richard Marquand's inability to direct action is much to the fore in this section, and he's not much better in the rest of the film, while Harrison Ford gives a particularly bad performance that's all too indicative of a bored man with nothing to do but stuck here anyway because of contractual obligation. If you can forget the dire first third, the rest of the film is okay when it's dealing with the Skywalkers' family feuds but less successful on the ground in the Teddy Bears Picnic - sorry, Ewok scenes.

2202430,3,B00076SCPW,"First off I have no problem with George Lucas altering his films. They are HIS films after all but I do take issue with Lucas not making the original films that a generation (or two) grew up on available in a restored form.

Fans should be aware that while a marked improvement on the laserdisc edition (which appears to be from the same source elements)the image is improved by being transferred digitally vs. analog. The film looks decent although no where near as good as the digitally enhanced edition included here. Why Lucas could not have had these anamorphically enhanced is beyond me (it would probably have required another transfer however and that does cost $$).

Colors are bolder here on ""Jedi"" than on ""Star Wars"" more than likely because the film elements survived the passage of time better (and the fact that they are a bit younger as well). The bigger your widescreen monitor is the more noticeable the flaws are in the prints, the transfer (it's nonanamorphic which basically means there's less clarity, less detail and inferior image quality). Anamorphic is the standard for DVD and improves the image quality signficantly so I'm a bit surprised that Lucas didn't at least try and upgrade these to an anamorphic transfer in some way shape or form.

The digitally altered version looks terrific. It's interesting because the fact that Lucas presents the original with minimal digital clean up and no restoration is kind of like an unhappy child being forced to hand over something they don't want to--they make sure it's in as bad of shape as possible so that no one will want it. It's almost as if Lucas is saying, ""see I was right about how bad these things looked"".

I hope we might see this improved for the NEXT incarnation coming out next year (rumor has it that it will be a deluxe boxed set of all the films)but have no firm info on that. This might be the only time fans can have original version I'm just disappointed that George didn't think enough of the fans of his films to improve the presentation of the original ""Jedi"" without altering further.",1158537600,,2081,4.708791208791209
2202431,5,B00076SCPW,"I always loved this film as a kid and now that I watch it now I  still don't know why some fans don't actually like it. It's not a 100% perfect ending to the series but it is close to it. The opening scene with Luke, Leia and friends at Jaba's palice to free Han Solo is just classic. Plus us original fans never knew what Jaba would look like if we ever saw him. I mean back then Jaba was never in the original movie. Seeing him for the first time in his palice all fat and slimy and trying to tongue kiss Leia is just both funny and creepy. If anything Lucas sorta ruined this film with a special edition. Jaba's palice looks like no place you'd wanna go. Then with the special edition he lightened up the scene with a silly looking alien dancing and singing a goofy song.

  So that takes away from the classic scene just a little. Return of the Jedi is probably just the weakest special edition. The original version I never really thought of the weakest link of the original trilogy. To me their was no weak link to the original trilogy, all of them were well done. Most fans just hate the cuddly Ewoks. But to me years later the Steve Urcle like alien Jar-Jar Binks totally made Ewoks look good. Hell they are even cool next to him. I honestly never really had a problem with them though. The only other thing that bugs me about the special edition is the new lame music that replaced the original Ewok celebration music at the end of the movie. Otherwise it's still a strong movie. Plus seeing how evil Ian McDiarmid could be as the Emperor for the first time is just classic as well. This guy definetly deserved to be nominated for either Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith. Sure he's a little over the top but still not many people can be this good or have as much fun giving an evil performance.",1158537600,,1812,4.228323699421965

2202433,3,B00076SCPW,"I suspect the reviewers who assert that the longtime fan base should be satisfied with the DVD transfers of the original theatrical versions because ""this is the way they looked back then"" never saw any of the original trilogy in 70mm with 6-track magnetic stereo sound on a 65-foot screen. Apparently they're not aware that DVD is a low-res medium compared to film. The fact is, the 1977-83 trilogy looked and sounded better in theatres, way back when, than in any home-video transfer since--including the 2004 ""Special Edition"" DVDs that restored (or approximated) the original color palette and cleaned up each frame along with adding George Lucas' can't-leave-well-enough-alone second thoughts to many scenes. So the argument that digitally remastering the original versions to 16x9 anamorphic would be ""tampering,"" and thus something the ""purists"" should object to, is disingenuous. Transferring movies from one medium (film) to another (digital) is inherently an act of tampering. So by doing as little as possible in bringing the original cuts to DVD, Lucas wasn't being respectful to those original versions. He was saying that he didn't think the original cuts were worth a high-quality presentation on DVD.

Well, the rumors are flying that better-looking transfers of the originals will eventually show up when a 30th anniversary edition of the '77-'83 trilogy is released on DVD. Having bought (and parted with) the 2004 boxed set and having just bought the separate issues of the ""before"" and ""after"" versions, I'm not sure that springing for that eventual THIRD reissue of these movies on DVD  is in the cards. This DVD of the circa-'83 ""Jedi"" is certainly watchable, if not as vivid as the 1997/2004 version on Disc 1 of this set. For me, though, the important thing is that, as with ""Star Wars"" and ""Empire,"" I can watch this movie without the intrusions of later revisions: digitally-added creatures, the loss of a Han Solo one-liner, a younger actor--whose face Luke Skywalker would never have seen--turning up as a paternal ghost, and an overblown celebration montage at the end (CGI crowds celebrating an event that apparently the entire universe had heard about within a couple hours of its occurrence). For that I'm glad. And if by chance I actually want to see the 1997/2004 revision, it's right there in the same DVD case as the original.",1158451200,,2362,5.085051546391752
2202434,3,B00076SCPW,"We are given 2-DVD releases where the films in the much sought-after original 1977/83 STAR WARS Trilogy are relegated to the status of ""bonus discs,"" a remarkably cynical move even for Lucas and Fox, who know full well that very few people actually want the dreadful 1997/2004 revisions that have been around on DVD for two years. These ""bonus discs"" are largely non-cleaned-up, low-definition, non-anamorphic transfers based on the 1993 laser discs. The picture is actually not bad, all things considered--better, in fact, than any other issuance of the originals (which admittedly appeared in media far inferior to the DVD); but with a little effort, they could have been so much better--especially for folks with 16x9 TVs. The 2.0 sound is more than adequate--actually rather clearer than the 5.1 mess that was produced for the 2004 disasters. Ironically, it is the 2.0 mix, not the 2004 5.1 remix, which is more similar to, though less complex than, the 6-channel, non-digital, non-surround stereo that was heard theatrically 30 years ago.

A couple of interesting details: one reviewer felt that these DVDs were worse than the 1995 VHS tapes, which he remembered as having been better cleaned up. In point of fact, the LDs from 1993 and the LDs/VHS tapes from 1995 were the *same* THX remasterings--just packaged differently; having seen both, I can say confidently that neither are nearly as good as these still-below-par DVDs. Moreover, the 1993/5 THX versions from which these DVDs were transferred are full of print damage at the same points--odd for a THX mastering; it means that even for what he said would be the *final* release in 1995, Lucas *already* didn't care about the old versions, as he was about to embark upon his 1997 distortions! Another important point: not all of these DVDs are direct LD transfers. For STAR WARS, the LD, and *every* home video version since the film first appeared on VHS, had the later title scroll that included ""Episode IV A New Hope."" This one, nicely, does not--the first time in a home video release! However, either good elements for this truly original opening do not survive or were not searched for hard enough because the whole frame rocks from side to side somewhat--owing to uneven print shrinkage: it's disconcerting to see a sky full of stars that all move back and forth together. This could have been cleaned up along with the many other points of print damage in the source material. One last observation: someone said that the opening sequence in STAR WARS is time-compressed. That is rubbish: all earlier versions have identical running times *to the second*! Let's not savage Mr. Lucas when he doesn't deserve it, folks.

The problem with allowing George Lucas to clean up, or even anamorphically enhance, *anything* in his original STAR WARS Trilogy is that he obviously wouldn't know when to quit, and we'd get another non-original permutation. It's a shame because far older films have been restored to look much better than the 1977-83 STAR WARS originals in their new DVD releases. Films of this cultural significance deserve far better. But since Lucas can't be trusted not to tinker, perhaps we should be satisfied while we're ahead, even though the results are compromised. If the originals ever do get issued in cleaner and higher-definition, anamorphically enhanced versions, you can bet that something will also be missing--again! My guess, however, is that Lucas regards his first versions merely as historical artifacts, remembering all the grief they caused him in the making; he obviously prefers to forget about them, continuing to insist that his most recent thoughts, however inferior we all find them, are the standards. It also occurs to me that Fox is testing the market: sure, thousands have been clamoring for the genuine films for years, but they wanted to see if we'd shell out the cash even for technically outmoded versions. Well, now we have. Perhaps they will realize that, despite how much we are currently protesting about Fox's (and perhaps Lucas') greed, when the originals are restored--not changed, just restored, preferably without Mr. Lucas' ""assistance""--we will, in fact, buy them. In the meantime, these are better than nothing. Watch them on a 4x3 SDTV.",1158364800,,4262,5.052556818181818
2202435,2,B00076SCPW,"Once again, George Lucas thumbs his nose at the most die-hard fans of the original Star Wars Trilogy.

When these films were FINALLY scheduled to be released on DVD in 2004, I was elated. At last, I would be able to own these 3 classic films in digital format, with superior picture quality, superior sound - and what I most eagerly awaited - digital correction of color shifting and elimination of glitches in the old blue-screen process (most noticeable around tie fighters in some battle scenes). What I received for my patience turned my stomach. Yes, the picture and sound were enhanced - wonderful. But instead of using advances in digital technology to correct flaws in the original films, all Lucas did was add incredibly annoying slapstick CG creatures, rework scenes that had been reworked once before in the 1997 theatrical releases (George, the hangar scene with Jabba will never work, and was completely unnecessary to begin with - give it up already!) and generally fiddle with CONTENT as opposed to improving QUALITY.

Yes, I know Lucas has said he simply made the films closer to what he had wanted to create in the first place. All I can say is that I am eternally grateful he did NOT get to make ""the films he wanted to make"" in 77, 80 and 83. It is precisely the limitations of the technology at the time that made him dig down and innovate and improvise as best he could. He was forced to be more resourceful. And that resourcefulness is why those original films are so superior to the ""reworked"" versions as well as vastly superior to the second trilogy. Lucas' main flaw as a filmmaker is that he becomes too entranced with technology and gimmickery. That is why the second trilogy, while visually impressive, was so obsessive about CG that other concerns like story and performances were clearly (and shamefully) reduced to afterthoughts. If films can be called ""lazy,"" then those were lazy films.

I wanted the original versions, and not the monkeyed-with versions (which I absolutely cannot watch). I wanted them because I was a kid when these films origially came out in theatres. I saw them repeatedly in their first runs. And the thing about films like those is that they have a cadence to them - a progression and rhythm from one scene to the next that you get used to and that becomes familiar to you. These films become old friends that you know and recognize. And any interruption in that cadence by fiddling with content makes them feel like strangers. I wanted my old friends back.

So now, finally, the Original Theatrical Versions are available on DVD for the first time. I wasted no time in picking them up. And once again, I feel shafted. Is it really asking so much to have the original films in anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 Surround? And Lucas STILL hasn't bothered to correct any of the blue-screen glitches!!!!!! I could burn a good VHS copy to DVD and get about the same results. This is Lucas' response to the clamouring from his oldest and most die-hard fans for the original versions?

Second, no new tentacles or venus flytrap looking mouths with the Sarlaac Pit!

Next, when Anakin has his mask removed by Luke, Sebastian Shaw who portrays Anakin has his eyebrows back! Yah!

The Ewok celebration scene...this was the one scene that disturbed me most by George's evilness. On this version we finally have the original Ewok celebration music! Finally!

This was a change that George really should have been kicked in the head about back in '04 when de digitally erased Shaw & replaced him with a new shot of Hayden Christiansen. Anakin returned to good, a Jedi when Luke brought back the good in him, hence Shaw as the spirit. Luke had never even seen what the young Anakin looked like, so why would/could Luke even recognize a young Anakin, yet alone smile at him!?

2202438,4,B00076SCPW,"RETURN OF THE JEDI was the third STAR WARS film, and it is the finale of the STAR WARS saga if watched in the order of the episode numbers.  This film managed to capture the action, character, humor, and spiritual themes of the earlier films for a third time.  However, this film is longer and features more kid-friendly elements(though the Rancor monster is not for small children).  By the time of this film's release, visual effects technology had reached a level where highly complex shots were possible with virtually no matte lines or other hints of visual trickery.  Relying on the previous film to develop the characters, this film focuses more on action, tying up storylines, and a long build to the climax of the saga.

 The first disk is essentially the same as the DVD released in 2004.  Given the quality of the original effects, there was little reason to replace them with newer ones. The addition of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker is illogical since Alec Guinness continues to play Obi-Wan Kenobi instead of Ewan McGregor.  The new musical numbers are inferior to the original numbers.  Other added scenes merely extend the length of the film, but changes to Han Solo's dialogue remove a character arc originally in the trilogy.

 The only reason to buy this DVD is for the ""bonus material"" of the original version of the film.  As reported, this DVD is not anamorphic and is based mostly on a previous video transfer of the film.  I have a wide-screen, high-definition television set, and the picture is better than I was expecting.  Although this is the newest of the original trilogy, the print used in this transfer is in much worse shape than the prints used for the other two films' ""bonus material."" Unfortunately, the subtitles for Jabba the Hutt are cropped off the bottom of a wide-screen television when the picture is expanded to fill the screen.  The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack is lackluster.

 Those with standard definition television sets should have no hesitance in purchasing this DVD for its ""bonus material.""  Watching it on a wide screen high-definition television involves trade-offs that would have been avoided with a typical anamorphic DVD.  Because of the music and character changes made in the special edition, the original film is the better film.  Film buffs should appreciate seeing what cutting-edge visual effects were in 1983.  However, first-time viewers may prefer the more state-of-the-art special edition.",1158278400,,2461,4.997542997542998
2202439,5,B00076SCPW,"OK, first of all, I have to say how disappointed I am with people lately, who seem to do nothing but complain.  First they complain that Lucas 'butchered' the old ones with his improvements, then when he offers the originals, they still complain, because it isn't EXACTLY the way they THINK it should be!  I am ashamed of these kinds of people.

That being said, I have no problem with the original version of ROTJ being a transfer from the Laserdisc release.  I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and my dad took me several times to see it, because he saw how much I loved it. It was our special time together. In fact, during one of those showings, I noticed an odd-looking figure walking in the aisles, and then I recognized the pattern of lights from Darth Vader's chest panel! Seeing him in the lobby of the theater, and shaking Darth Vader's hand was the thrill of a lifetime for a little Star Wars nut like me. :)  I had the original video tapes, and I was too young at the time to know the difference between pan/scan and letterbox(as they were called back then) formats.

For me, I remember seeing the old movies in their so-called 'crappy' format, and seeing them in that format here now is rather nostaligic for me, which is why I give this set a high rating. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even expecting the original versions to be in widescreen at all.

There were not many changes made from the old version of Return of the Jedi to the Special Edition; mainly digital remastering, the musical number in Jabba the Hutt's palace, the Sarlacc, and the music at the ending. And in those three instances, I like the remasters better. Losing an admittedly incompleted song, an inanimate animal, and cheezy Ewok singing (while amusing,) which wasn't fit to showcase the ending of the saga, wasn't such a high price.

In fact, I prefer the Special Editions, because they are the versions that George Lucas always had in mind, but wasn't able to make because of the limitations of technology.

So, are you going to take advantage of a chance to have both versions of this classic movie, or are you going to sit like a punished child and pout that it wasn't done exactly the way you want it?",1158278400,,2207,4.456575682382134

However if you own the earlier DVD box set do not bother waisting your money on these low resolution bad audio transfer original films. Lucas is at his tricks again getting more bucks out of Star Wars fans while holding out on us. I work in technology and I know that the transfer of these original films is low and was done on purpose. Could have been much better. True Star Wars fans just wait out the time because the originals will be released again when Lucas teams with Sony and Blue Ray and helps them in their push against HD DVD for the future of DVD viewing. As he has proven in the past George wants to get all out of us that he can so this current release is nothing but a teaser for what is to come in the next couple of years.,1158192000,,940,4.032085561497326

What I am not happy about is that we have to spend major dollars to get the corrupted versions AGAIN! They should've released these for no more than 10 ea. or in a box set w/ just the pure untouched originals.

2202443,4,B00076SCPW,"I've already left comments for Episode IV and after looking at the comments for ""Return of the Jedi"" I thought I should leave a review for Episode VI as well.

Ok, I know this is going to sound like common sense for most people, but this specific Star Wars release is for individuals who either have not already purchased the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD or have been waiting around for George Lucas to release the Original Theatrical Version since ""The Phantom Menace"" came out. If you have no interest in owning a single copy of the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD before the 1997 Special Edition or 2004 Digital Remastering, then this set of movies is not for you.

However, if you are a Star Wars purist, have an artistic interest in the evolution of the Star Wars Trilogy, or want to reconnect to the movies that began it all (before they were tweaked), then I would highly recommend purchasing this version without reservation.

With regard to ROTJ, I have to remark that the transfer could have been better. Although the film quality is far superior than Episode IV and much better than Episode V, there is no reason that this movie should not have been touched up, provided with a 5.1 digital surround sound (Dolby or DTS), or remastered with an anamorphic widescreen. The fact that the DVD lacks these features (along with the fact that the original theatrical version is considered a ""Bonus Disk"") provides a clear picture that Lucas did not take his time in providing a set for the fans of the original trilogy but instead decided to make a feign attempt to placate those individuals who have been begging for a set of these movies on DVD as they were originally produced.

For individuals who are hesitant, I would recommend waiting to purchase this item because historically nothing released by George Lucas is truly for ""a limited time only."" Additionally, there is a good chance that another set or boxed set will be released next year in order to celebrate 30th anniversary of Star Wars. Also keep in mind that once Blu-Ray and HD-DVD players become standard household devices we will see another release of these movies; probably with the same ""limited edition"" label attached.

Hopefully, those who do decide that it is worthwhile to pick up a copy of this movie or all of these movies will be pleased to finally own a version of the Star Wars Trilogy that reflects the movies they saw and fell in love with for the first time.",1158105600,,2434,4.638051044083527

Nevertheless, the original theatrical versions, as presented, look quite respectable on normal, good-quality (if not HD) 4:3 TVs or monitors; they are basically crisp and correctly colored, better than any VHS, LD, or unauthorized, private DVD-R made from the LDs that I have seen. The 2.0 sound is accurately chosen; the original closing credits simply say ""Dolby Noise Reduction"": Dolby Digital 5.1, like any digital format, was certainly unknown in 1977. To those who have said that these are merely copies of the 1993 laser discs, I would point out that STAR WARS has the original title crawl, without the later-added ""Episode IV: A New Hope"": absolutely the first time we see it in any home video form, including the laser discs. On the other hand, some cleaning up of video speckling and anamorphic enhancement for 16x9 TVs would not have been difficult or costly these days; and the omission of special features present on the extra disc of the 2004 4-DVD set, like the ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary or any trailers, is disappointing. The original versions are packaged with Lucas' later revisions/remasterings (""Special Editions"") which few people need (and many don't want) but the combination does provide an immediate way to compare and contrast. If the raw form in which the original films are offered was Lucas' way of trying to bias people toward the more opulent, restored 2004 revisions, he has erred again and accomplished exactly the opposite: the theatrical versions win, hands down, even in a less sophisticated presentation. If, as Lucas says, the original elements are in too poor condition to fully restore the old versions and these are the best he is willing or able to give us, I am not too disappointed: indeed, were he to find good elements and restore them, doubtless he would start tampering all over again. At least these imperfect prints show no marks of intrusion. Moreover, the color timing for the 2004 revisions was dramatically altered and, because film fades with age, any changes made to the content of the extant old prints or negatives would be guesswork. I suspect that the theatrical versions in these sets are as accurate as they can be. As I said, some print damage might have been corrected and anamorphic enhancement could have been added (even some private from-LD versions have it), but these are small matters in the overall scheme of things.",1158105600,,2746,5.010940919037199

2202449,5,B00076SCPW,"When I normally review a film or book, I try to include a short summary about what the film is about. However, for RETURN OF THE JEDI I'm not going to do that. RETURN OF THE JEDI is viewed by most fans as the weakest film in the original trilogy. There are a lot of people who hated and still hate the Ewoks (I think partially because Ewoks were originally supposed to be Wookies and partially because a lot of fans saw the Ewoks as just another way George was marketing the ""final"" Star Wars film to younger children and more girls instead of the core-fan base). I actually really enjoy RETURN OF THE JEDI. To me, I find the film to be a fitting conclusion that wraps the entire story together. Also, having the Ewoks as part of the army that actually helps take down the evil empire says a lot about underdogs, Average Joes, and John Qs being able to make a difference in the world. But that's just me.

I didn't buy the STAR WARS DVD set that was released in 2004 because the original movies that I saw as a kid weren't a part of the set. Even though George Lucas practically swore that the original films would never see the light of day again, I knew better. I bided my time and it paid off. The original RETURN OF THE JEDI is now contained on a second disc in this 2-disc release. There are a lot of complaints about the sound and visual quality of the original film on this DVD. Personally, it doesn't bother me. I don't get as caught up with those things as a lot of people do, for instance high-definition television doesn't look all that different to me than regular television--it's a little brighter, but that's about the only difference I can see. What was important to me is that I finally have a DVD version of the original movie I saw when I was a kid, without the special editing and digital alterations of original actors. My only complaint is that it would have been nice if this edition included more extra features (just a commentary with George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, and some other people; DVD-ROM weblink; and a promo for the LEGO STAR WARS II video game). I realize that Lucas is storing that up for the ""ultimate"" STAR WARS DVD collection (rumored to me 8 or more discs) to be released around 2007-2009. To be honest, I probably won't buy that because I've already got the movies I wanted. It might not be a lot, but I'm satisfied.",1157932800,,2356,4.3545454545454545

The original release version of Return of the Jedi (the only reason to buy this set as most all fans will already have one of the previous Special Edition releases) is relegated to bonus material on disc two.  Ouch!  But wait, it gets worse.

George Lucas, the champion of pristine presentation in the theatre and at home has released the film that made him a legend in the state of the art of technology circa 1993.

Yes, that's right.  This transfer is from the laserdisc release of '93.  Even worse the film is not anamorphic like just about every other modern day DVD.  What does that mean?  Well a non-anamorphic DVD has a low visual clarity and the image won't fill a widescreen TV.  To make a movie anamorphic takes very little time and money.  That Jedi is not anamorphic shows a disregard for the film that is disturbing.

Star Wars fans expect these landmark films to be treated just like many other films (Vertigo, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Snow White, etc.) that have gotten detailed restorations that cleaned up dirt, grime and audio ticks and presented the films in today's state of the art.  This is the release most fans were dreaming of.  A release that showed the film some modicrum of respect.

It's time to show George that he no longer rules the universe as he once did.  And the only way to do that is to hit him where he'll actually notice, his pocket book.  He obviously doesn't listen to anything or anyone else.

Why shouldn't you buy these Original Trilogy (OT) DVDs?

First, the movies won't be anamorphic.  To quote Bill Hunt of The Digital Bits web site, ""Anamorphic enhancement is the widely accepted industry standard for the presentation of widescreen films on DVD"".  Is it really that bad that the movies won't be anamorphic, well not really, but it's symptomatic of the reasons for George releasing these movies.  He's only doing it because he's feeling forced to do, but he's not going to be nice about it, so no anamorphic print.  Very lame.  And besides, that process really doesn't cost all that much to begin with.

Second, according to George these movies will be from the best source material available, baloney.  They are from the Laserdisc masters, which for the time, were great.  But compared to today's movies they are sub-par.  Lucasfilm says there are no longer any valid ""source material"" copies of the OT because he had them all destroyed when they release the ""Special Edition"" version.  Again baloney.  Many copies of the original movies do exist in private collections, film history archives and other places that he cannot destroy.  Anyone of these could be used to create an true cleaned up OT version.  I still have my copy of the Star Wars: The Definitive Collection release and it's an okay print, but with a little cleaning up it could be fantastic.

Third, he says he doesn't want to allocate the resources to the cleanup.  Fine.  There are any number of studios who have said they would get better copies of the prints (even the source for the LD prints would be fine) and clean them up and make them anamorphic for no charge.  They just want to be associated with the project.

Yes, they're his movies and he has the right to make changes (whether you agree or not with the changes) as he sees fit.  And while I don't like the changes he's made (especially in Star Wars which, in my opinion, were atrocious) I am willing to let the director do what he fells is best for his movies and support or not support these changes by purchasing or not purchasing the updated versions.  There will always be arguments about the validity of ""Director's Cuts"" (think Blade Runner and Brazil) but the simple answer is they are ""Director's Cuts"" and they can do what they want with ""their"" movies.  According to Lucas, the ""Special Edition"" version is the true vision that he had for the movies.  If that is truly the case George, why the waffling on the different OT versions.  Go with one and stick with it.  Period.  This so-called acquiescence to the fans to release the original movies has been downright insulting, condescending and not worthy of a studio as great as Lucasfilm is (or has been in the past).

And the final reason to not buy these movies is simple:  George says he is releasing them to, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""appease the fans"".  [...]!  He's releasing them for one simple reason.  Money.  Think about it.  Every time something new for Star Wars has come out, he's released some version on DVD.  He's planning on releasing a super-duper box set of all the movies in a couple of years as well as the HD-DVD versions, what kind of teasers is he going to release between now and then.  He knows he can release anything with the words Star Wars on them and we'll buy them.

Well not anymore for this consumer.  I've given ol' George the last dime I ever will.  In fact, I'm boxing up my ""Special Edition"" version of the OT on DVD and sending them back to George with this note.  I have the Laserdisc editions and while dated in their look and feel, they are truly the ""original trilogy"".  I might even send back all three prequel DVDs as well just to prove the point.",1153872000,,3970,4.5702127659574465

If you already caved and shelled out your money to Lucas for various other VHS or DVD incarnations of the movie, that's your own fault, and your reviews have nothing to do with this set!",1153440000,,649,4.408333333333333
2202464,1,B00076SCPW,"Well, I was going to pick these up to get the theatrical cut of each film in a widescreen release, but it looks like I will not now. It's really disappointing that they are non-anamorphic and since it seems to be inevitable that they will be re-released at some point with anamorphic transfers despite the fact that Lucas says otherwise. If I was still using a standard television set for my primary device to view DVDs, this would be fine for now I suppose, but having just purchased a widescreen television in January, non-anamorphic DVDs are not attractive to me at all.

So a warning to all, if you don't know the difference between anamorphic and non-anamorphic DVDs and unless you don't mind buying these again to get anamorphic transfers in the future, I suggest you go do a search on the web to see for yourself what the difference is so that you can make a more informed purchase.",1153094400,,889,4.55625
2202465,5,B00076SCPW,"So many negative reviews & low scores based solely on the fact that the remade versions were already released on DVD.

So what.

If you don't like the new versions then you shouldn't have bought them; instead of buying something you didn't want & knocking the classic versions now only because you're upset with having spent the money. You could have stuck with the VHS box set, or some fan-restored LD to DVD classic version. Sorry to tell you that LucasFilm is a business - making money is what they do. Staggering the release of 2 different versions of a DVD has really become standard practice...to make more money. When the first box set came out Lucas wasn't planning on ever releasing the originals again (watch interviews with him - he's downright embarrassed by the technical qualities of the original movies, like he wants to hide them), so this new set is really an unexpected blessing for old-school fans.

These are the classics. These are what I remember from my youth. The Max Rebo & Ewok songs in their full glory.

I already own the other DVD set, and that's cool. It's worth owning both just to see the differences between Lucas' original and ""true"" visions. I did the same thing with the Lord of the Rings - happily bought both versions of each movie.

If they had offered the originals at the same time as the remade DVDs, I would have picked these instead, but oh well. Now there'll be 3 more DVDs to display on the shelf - showing my fandom to all who enter my living-room.

I'm glad they're over-turning what Lucas had said years ago - that the VHS box set would be the last-ever release of the original versions.

The fans have spoken, and what the fans want are the classics, which is what they're delivering, so thumbs up.",1152921600,,1748,4.547770700636943
2202466,5,B00076SCPW,"""Return of the Jedi"" is unquestionably one of the best science fiction movies of all time, though there are moments where it doesn't shine quite as brightly as Episodes 4 and 5 in a galaxy far, far away.

Here are some basic pros and cons.

Pros: The movie's special effects are even better than ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  Lucas spared no expense, and the cast continued their remarkable performances helping to bring the trilogy to a dramatic and powerful conclusion.

Cons: The movie is a rehash of ""A New Hope"" with the same basic plot line that a giant manmade machine-planet will hover around the galaxy threatening to destroy anything that dares oppose the Emperor.  The movie even starts off the same with R2 and C3PO on the desert planet of Tattoine.  Then Luke voyages to Dagobah to meet with Yoda, just like he did in ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  And finally a light saber duel is followed by the exploding Death Star scene, so the movie feels a little bit like a repeat.  Despite this, ""Return of the Jedi"" captures your attention with non-stop wonder and imaginative appeal, and the only awkward moments are a few burping scenes at the beginning of the movie after a toad-like creature eats something, and after the sand-pit monster chows down on a bad guy.

Overall this is an ""A"" movie, while its classic predecessors ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" earned ""A+"" grades.

But unfortunately...

George Lucas does NOTHING to make the quality of the UNALTERED versions better.

1. The widescreen is NOT anamorphic (which means the picture will be very narrow on your widescreen TV).
2. The picture, although it's clear, is not digitally remastered.
3. The sound is not enhanced. Dolby Digital 2.0. The sound can be very meshy, and might not be effective if you have surround sound.

George Lucas said he did not intend to release the original versions. It's obvious he wasn't very proud of them. And ONLY just because of mad fan protest, he gives them a quick release, but shows his fans that he doesn't care that much about the original versions.

It's a great product to have if you're a die-hard fan, still. I would only recommend just buying the enhanced version boxset if you're a casual fan.",1151798400,,1154,4.698019801980198

Nobody is holding a gun to anyone's heads...if you don't want it, DON'T BUY IT!  Lucas does not have some magical power to make you spend your money.

I made the decision to wait until the originals were released...it's called willpower.  I refused to give Lucas my money for the special editions when what I really wanted was the originals.  I didn't know if Lucas was ever going to release the originals...but now that it's here, I don't feel the need to wait anymore.

But keep complaining if you want, I'm not listening and I don't think Lucas cares!

Granted the price is high but you know Wal-Mart and Best Buy will sell them for $10 - $15 cheaper. Now as far as milking us for all the money for all the releases...well. Although it seems klike it has been rleased a lot, to be truthful. the first trilogy has only been released 3 times ( the initial releases were $90 each)then the price drop of with teh same box art, still the same release though, then there was the changed box art, then the THX printing ( laserdiscs were released at the same time so they count as the same release,despite the introduction of the widescreen format) then the Special Editions came out in August of 1997(both VHS and LD), and then again in different artwork so a second time for the SED never to be released again....Now we have for the 7th time, but only because of this special release we get the original Dolby 2.0 versions ( ROTJ was actually the first film released using the THX technology so its 2.0 will sound better) Now, here people are saying that Lucas is just doing it for money....well, if you think about it, back in 1992 he didn't know DVD technology was coming out....and, Star Wars is not the only film to be re-released several times on video either. How many versions of West Side Story, Willy Wonka, and there are probably as many re-releases of Wizard of Oz as there are (or close) to Star Wars. Oh and guess what....Next year, the Entire James Bond series will be re-relased again....By the way..since the 3 films in their original form are considered as extras, people should stop griping...When the SED's were first released 2 years ago, people were whining that they couldn't buy them separately, here's their chance.

First the original trilogy was released on VHS.  Then the special edition on VHS.  Then the special edition on DVD.  Then the special edition again on dvd with a few more tweaks, and I've lost count, but I think there was even more releases.  Now we're getting the original version on dvd, but not cleaned up.

Oh how it hurts to say it ~_~

People this is just the same as the laser disc version of the film which still exists at some website called dvdstars in the old silver trillogy boxed set. What a calamity that this extra comes in 2.0. Though I have to admit I may just find the old gritty sound appealing.

IS THERE NO HOPE?

Can't someone cut the new trillogy editions to form a 'fans original cut' of the film. So that all the extras are cut out and all the original dialogue is back in. Its gettin pretty pathetic that its come to this. Surley if the studio were to do this - I bet a copy exists somewhere - by cutting from the new films and only having to master small specific dialogue scenes, and a few reels of film. It wouldn't cause such a dent in anyones wallets.

REMASTER the original GODDAMNIT, and treat it with the respect it deserves. If it does ever happen I'm afaid it won't be till the year 2010.

First, I would like to apologize for the miscommunication regarding the inclusion of the original theatrical films on these DVDs.

Honest. Also, I would like to apologize for the Special Editions but see, my ex-wife Marcia was taking me to the cleaners so I had to make some changes for legal reasons so I wouldn't have to divvy up half the Ranch just to get her off my back. That is the reason why I will never let the original films out of the vault again. I swear.

Oh, one other thing, I have just built a new complex for ILM at the Presidio and I just got the bill and it seems I'm a little short on cash so if you could all be so kind and buy these cheapo DVDs for me just one more time, I'd really appreciate it!

2202503,1,B00076SCPW,"I was ecstatic when I first read the announcement that the Original Unaltered Star Wars Trilogy would be released on DVD in September. It didn't seem possible since George Lucas had previously stated on several different occasions that the Special Editions/Editions of the moment are his preferred versions and that in fact, the originals no longer exist. Hope was all but lost that the non-SE versions would ever see the light of DVD. But then the announcement came and all was right with the world. Finally LucasFilm was releasing official DVDs of the films that started it all in, I presumed, the best quality possible because, hey, this is LucasFilm. They stand for top notch quality and presentation. All of their previous DVDs have featured incredible picture and sound, so this announcement was a wonderful surprise. Even though the original theatrical versions were to be released on the second disc of a two-disc package with the main feature being the 2004 Special Edition which I already have since I bought the previously released 4 Disc Trilogy box set, and even though the Original Unaltered film would be relegated to the second disc of said 2 Disc package as ""bonus material,"" I wasn't too concerned given LucasFilm's track record of fabulous treatment of bonus material. Every other previous Star Wars DVD had some wonderful supplements - all enhanced for widescreen displays which is very forward thinking to a time when widescreen HDTVs will be in households all over the country. Just another reason to have confidence in LucasFilm.

Then a few days later, Bill Hunt at thedigitalbits.com broke the news that the transfers for the Original Theatrical Versions were going to be ported over from the most recent (circa. 1992/93) widescreen laserdisc transfer and not be enhanced for widescreen displays. LucasFilm has confirmed this in an email sent by Lynne Hale and in published interviews with LucasFilm employees. This news is unfortunate on many levels. For one thing, given the state of the Home Theater art LucasFilm is essentially releasing a sub-par product. These days widescreen films are always enhanced for widescreen displays - more detail is shown because of the extra lines of resolution. There isn't a studio that does not carry out this practice, no matter how low a film's box office take it will be treated to a brand new widescreen transfer that will be enhanced for my widescreen display. But LucasFilm has opted to ignore the industry standard and give us a transfer that is vastly inferior to the mainstream. These films will suffer from loss of detail and the widescreen image will be framed by a large rectangle on my widescreen display. Not a pretty picture!

I'm sad to say that I won't be purchasing this DVD because the only reason for me to have done so is for the Original Unaltered Version of Return of the Jedi - I already own the 2004 version. LucasFilm has lost a sale due to their missed opportunity.",1148688000,,2955,4.919839679358717

2202509,1,B00076SCPW,"This could very easily be an ecstatic 5-star review. The original, unaltered Star Wars trilogy, finally on DVD with no droid & alien cartoon antics, no Hayden Christensen's face on Sebastian Shaw's body, no videogame-quality Jabba the Hutt, the original Academy Award-winning special effects, the music we remember... This should be a red-letter DVD release for Star Wars fans. Sadly, it is not.

Here's why you should boycott this release:

1. The picture & sound are intentionally presented in mediocre quality. These DVD's are transferred from the exact same videotape used to create the laserdisc release in 1993. That means a non-anamorphic, muddy, letterboxed picture that will have to be zoomed in to fill widescreen TVs or computer monitors. Lucasfilm refuses to fulfill the basic minimum standards of a current DVD release and make a new transfer. The quality of this DVD presentation will not live up to that of such timeless classics as Caddyshack II & Ishtar.

2. It's overpriced. If Lucasfilm is only willing to toss out these beloved films in this shoddy version, and they are unwilling to spend any time or money at all on their release, that is their right. They should charge accordingly. As bootleg-quality laserdisc transfers, these DVD's should sell for $5-$10, tops. Incredibly, Lucasfilm is charging $90 retail for these three movies! That's almost twice the cost of the (still available) box set with the exact same Special Edition discs!

They're trying to justify the cost by bundling the unaltered movies (the only reason to buy this version) with the Special Edition movies, but they must know it's a sham. Anybody who is willing to pay $90 ($60 @ Amazon) for the Special Edition DVD's has already bought the existing box sets. The Special Edition discs in this set are a complete waste of plastic, and they do not justify the outrageous cost.

If, for some reason, you have not yet purchased Star Wars on DVD, this set may be an adequate value. For anyone else, this set plus the existing box set you already have will run you a total of $160 retail ($110 @ Amazon). Is that a fair price to pay for an intentionally mediocre release of the movie that made Lucas' empire possible? Is it right to release this classic piece of cinematic history with picture and sound quality far below the latest releases of Buckaroo Banzai or Barbarella? I'll leave that for you to decide.",1148601600,,2400,4.872549019607843
2202510,1,B00076SCPW,"Obviously I haven't seen the actual DVDs yet, since they won't be released until September, but I *have* seen the transfer  that will make up the ""bonus feature"" on disc 2, the original 1983 version of ""Return of the Jedi"". I own the 1993 laserdisc.  That was ""state-of-the-art"" THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, but the state of the art has moved on considerably since then.  The transfer will look like trash on DVD, especially blown-up on a widescreen TV.  (Among other things the translation subtitles for the alien languages will be cut-off, since Lucasfilm and Fox decided to put electronic versions in the letterboxing bars rather than use a print with the subtitles burned into the film or at least have the electronic ones placed over the frame where they belong.)

Even if you don't have a widescreen television, you should always insist that any DVD you buy today be ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" or ""enhanced for 16:9 displays"".  Why?  1)  Chances are your next TV will be a widescreen HD set.  2)  An DVD enhanced for widescreen TVs can only be created from a very high-quality digital video master.  That means the studio can't just slap an existing laserdisc or VHS master created an old print years ago onto a DVD (which is what Lucasfilm is doing here.)  Instead they have to go back to the source material, and *create* a new hi-def digital master in cases where none existed before.  That produces a better looking and sounding result on both standard screens and wide screens.

If you are thinking about buying this disc primarily to get a true high-quality DVD edition of the 1980 film, as I was, save your money.  I already own the Special Edition on DVD and the 1993 laserdisc.  I would have cheerfully bought this new release if it had included a newly remastered, enhanced-for-widescreen edition of ""RotJ"".  But I'm not paying twice for material *identical* to what I already have.  Contrary to what has been suggested in another review, I'm not ""angry"" that Lucas released the special editions.  There are things in them I like a lot, that I think were definite improvements.  There are things I don't think worked so well.  Which is also how I've always felt about the original versions. :)

Nobody that I know of has ever called for *only* the original versions to be released.  What we've always wanted was *both* versions - so that those who preferred one of the other could have a choice, and the rest of us could buy both.  Contrary to the comment in that earlier review fans would *not* have been happy if this set had been the first released on DVD - because the original films would still have been treated as an afterthought and delivered in a grossly inferior presentation.  That would not have been any more acceptable to fans then than it is now.  If anything the much larger installed base of widescreen TVs makes this release even more of a joke.

Perhaps if enough people ignore this release Lucasfilm will spend the money necessary to do a *proper* release of the film - which contrary to their claims is certainly possible with the use of the latest film restoration techniques and with source material that survives in the hands of private collectors.  I can't imagine that they will have any trouble making their money back, since I, for one, have bought about six different editions of these movies on home video.  But I won't buy this one.

Quite apart from anything else, the three original ""Star Wars"" films are a part of film history.  They changed the industry, they changed the expectations of the audience.  But it was the films released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 that did all that, not the revised, improved and prettied-up version released in theaters many years later.  The original film should always be preserved and made available *as it was* in the best format available for today's audiences and for future generations.  No one can judge the impact the film had by watching the 2nd re-edit of the film done 20-odd years after the fact.

Vote with your wallets.  Vote ""no"" to a grudging and insulting release.  Vote ""yes"" for a future release done right.  Do *not* pre-order this nonsense.  It may not be too late to change some minds at Lucasfilm.",1148601600,,4192,4.706043956043956

No: the fans will take what they can get, even if it isn't what they want.

The fans could have protested the release of the special edition DVD's by refusing to buy them. Case Closed. I'm sure most of the complainers out there bought the special editions, since their reviews note that they feel like they are being ripped off now.  I agree that studios today do try to milk fans out of money by re-releasing special editions and the like.  It is sleazy, and I can't stand it either.  This may or may not be the case with these star wars re-releases, but to me, it doesn't matter either way.  Your opinion doesn't matter.  Your angry reviews don't matter.

So if you are angry about being ripped off because of this re-release, write an angry letter and mail it to yourself.  Next time a DVD comes out that isn't up to par, don't buy it; simple as that.  Stop acting like mindless consumers, put your money where your mouth is, and spare everyone your hypocritical comments (yes, it is hypocritical to trash a dvd and buy it anyways).

I realize that my comments might come across as harsh, but I mean no disrespect to you all.

Should we just consume everything Star Wars related without thought or question, nor any basis for quality or standards?

It's quite clear a this point, that the people behind these new releases, are doing their best to make them as unappealing as possible.

The attitude behind this marketing ploy is of complete disrespect...

1) They are not putting any effort into the quality of the product.

2) They are not even going to offer the basics of home video standard that the world has come to expect in 2006 with 16x9 enhanced (read: anamorphic) transfers.

3) Instead they intend to source the video from outdated laserdisc transfers from the mid-90's, which is completely unacceptable. Why not just port over the full-screen VHS image while you're saving time, money, etc?

4) Nevermind the fact that they couldn't even see fit to put the individual DVD's in a simple slip box and package the 'trilogy' as it should respectfully be offered, and as any other movie franchise collection would be in 2006... But they've even refused to offer covers that look like a minimal ammount of time was spent to design and promote these inferior discs. Despite the terrible cheap looking photoshopped covers, the aesthetics aren't that significant overall - but it's yet another strike against any thought, care or quality control being devoted to this 'throw-away' release.

So we are simply expected to purchase these DVD's because they are apparently ""Limited Editions"" (perhaps they want these pulled from the market as quickly as possible before anyone has time to realize and publicize on how crappy and insignificant a waste they are?) and because George Lucas and company recognize how much money they can squeeze out of consumers with anything SW related.

Not so.

When I heard that the original trilogy was going to be released this year, of course I was thrilled, until I found out that Lucasfilm decided to not anamorphically enhance the films. According to [...], the films will NOT be anamorphically enhanced, and will feature a Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack. I'm fine with not having 5.1 sound, but in this day and age, anamorphic releases are not only mandatory, BUT are EXPECTED by studios. By not making these DVDs anamorphic, the movies themselves are at a lower resolution, therefore will look crappy, especially if you have to zoom in, which most people with widescreen televisions will have to do.

The DVDs have been mastered from the 1993 VIDEO masters that were originally used for the ""Definitive Collection"" laserdisc set. In short, they've ported the masters they used for the laserdisc transfers onto the new DVDs. So, basically, you're getting the films as they'd be seen at their best in 1993 on 2006 DVDs. The non-anamorphic video master they used for the new DVDs is 13 years old, made with obsolete equipment for obsolete video formats (Laserdisc and VHS).

I have decided to pass on these discs. I'll stick with the 2004 box set, thank you very much. Besides, I'm sure Lucas will whore out his films more and more throughout time.

2202538,5,B00076SCPW,"""Never. I'll never turn to the Dark Side. You've failed your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.""

""So be it. Jedi.""

- Luke Skywalker informs The Emperor its a dawning of a new day for the Jedi, but, The Emperor is less than enthusiastic for the ""Return of The Jedi""

The ""Star Wars"" saga comes to a close in this satisfying conclusion to the most popular Sci-fi space opera in film history.

Luke Skywalker, with the help of his friends, returns to his home planet of Tatooine to rescue his friend Han Solo from the gangster Jabba The Hutt.

Luke also travels back to Dagobah to continue his training in the Jedi arts, but, a shocking surprise waits for him.

Across the galaxy, The Galactic Empire is readying its latest weapon - a new Death Star, that is twice as big as the first one, & will spell certain doom to the band of freedom fighters trying to restore peace to the galaxy. When word is found out that both, Darth Vader & The Emperor, are overseeing the construction of this new battle station, The Rebel Alliance band together for a last ditch effort to crush the Empire once & for all.

""Jedi"" ties up a lot loose ends, but, is actually the weakest film out of the original trilogy. The problem with the film is its overkill in some sequences. Case in point the Jabba's Palace denizens are all reminiscent of the Cantina sequence in ""Star Wars"" (I don't acknowledge its ""Epiosde IV"". Gimme a f**ing break!) & the Death Star battle is a bigger version of the end battle from the first film. The lightsabre battle at the end of ""Jedi"" can't top the one from ""Empire"" (the best battle in the entire saga).
That doesn't mean they suck, though. There is plenty of action & its all plain ass good.

As for the Leia/Luke scene, where Leia tells Luke about her real mother, she has got to be talking about her stepmother & not her real mother. This leads one to believe that Leia was never told that she was adopted & I can only assume that Leia might think that mama Organa is mother to both Luke and her, instead of Padme, with Vader being both their father. Leia also tells Luke that she remembers her (adoptive) mother only a little bit, saying that she was beautiful, but, sad. This lead me to believe that Leia's adoptive mother died early in her infancy, taking that dark secret of Leia's real parentage to her grave. With Bail Organa (Leia's adoptive father from Episode III) dying in the destruction of Alderaan in the first ""Star Wars"" film, Leia will never know who her real mother is.

As for her ""knowing"" about ""The Force"" all along, she's probablly referring to the end scene in ""Empire"" when Luke calls out to Leia to save him.

The differences in ""Jedi"" in the past 22 years:

The Special Edition release in 1997 excised the ""Lapti Nek"" musical number from Jabba's Palace (bad) & is replaced with ""Jedi Rocks"" (a lot of die-hard fans call this ""Jedi Sucks""). Overall, no improvement either way.

Also in the S.E. release, the ""Yub-Nub"" Ewok song is excised and replaced with the more stomachable ""Ewok Celebration"" with new footage of cities & planets that were used all through the saga including Tatooine (duh!), Cloud City, Naboo, & Coruscant (keep a sharp eye out as a statue of The Emperor is toppled down, Saddam Hussein style, & watch as a few Stormtroopers get lynch mobbed). Overall, likable improvement that at the time gave audiences its first official sneak peek at the prequels.

Sorry, the Ewoks are still here.

One addition is a small pan shot of a herd of Banthas grazing in the desert sands of Tatooine, just before Jabba's sail barge comes cruising over the dune sea.

For the 2004 DVD release:

Darth Vader's eyebrows get CGI synged, when finally unmasked by Luke & in an oddball CGI move Sebastian Shaw who plays an aged ghost of Anakin Skywalker is replaced by Hayden Christensen from episodes ""II"" & ""III"". The only reason I can think of as to why George Lucas would do this, is that when Anakin crossed over to the dark side he did so at a young age. But, that still doesn't explain that if Anakin is redeemed by Luke at such an old age, why doesn't he materialize as part of ""The Force"" at the age that he was redeemed at? In other words, Lucas got this right the first time around.

Due to popular demand, ""Return Of The Jedi"" will finally be released in it's original 1983 release for a limited time only starting on September 12 through to December 31, 2006.

The Good - The 1983 release print to ""Jedi"" on disc 2. Lucasfilm plays fair when it comes to Limited Edition ""Star Wars"" items, so if you plan on getting these get'em before the end of December. Lucasfilm usually recalls all overstock from stores, so be careful. Disc 1 has the ""Enhanced"" version to ""Jedi"", or for most people a free frisbee that doubles as a drink coaster.

The Bad - Dolby Digital..., 2.0. The transfer for ""Jedi"", ""Star Wars"", & ""Empire"" are non-anamorphic laserdisc transfers from the 1993 Definitive Edition laserdisc box set (I own this set & the transfers aren't that bad, but, considering these transfers are 13 years old & the world media has come along way, Lucasfilm still should have done something, anything).

The Pathetic - I'm practically the only person who wrote a review about THE MOVIE for f**k sake!?

I wish to God that people would stop pis**ng & b*t*hing & moaning about how they won't buy this because it's - 1.) an inferior product, 2.) it's not in 16X9 or Dolby Digital 5.1 (boo-f*c*ing-hoo), 3.) Lucas will never get another dime from me! Never! Ever! Wah-wah! Waaaaah! (at this point a tantrum ensues). Shut. The. F*c*. Up. LFL does not care.

The End - nope. With May 25th 2007 being the thirtieth anniversary for everything ""Star Wars"" it's hard to imagine Lucasfilm letting it slip by. ""Star Wars"" in 3-D anyone?",1147996800,,5786,4.532629558541267

2202540,5,B00076SCPW,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, while the evil Galactic Empire hastens construction on its new, second Death Star, Luke Skywalker's loyal droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, carryout their role in a rescue mission to retrieve their friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. As the two droids procure servants' positions in the slug-like Jabba's desert palace on Tatooine, Princess Leia Organa arrives in the guise of a bounty hunter named Bousch, Chewbacca the Wookie in tow as her supposed bounty.  Newest rebel recruit Lando Calrissian already in place and disguised as a palace guard, the stage is set for the final arrival, would-be Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, bringing with him the consequences of Jabba's refusal to be paid for Han Solo's freedom. However, before that happens, the plan is for Leia to free Han herself that night. The attempt is unsuccessful. While the princess does manage to free Han from his carbonite prison, Jabba and his cronies catch Leia in the act, and she soon finds herself clad in metal slave-girl garb and kept on the end of a leash at Jabba's side. Han, on the other hand, is locked away in the same dungeon cell his partner Chewbacca is being held in. The two share a bittersweet reunion. As day breaks again, Luke Skywalker arrives to take matters into his own hands, but his threats upon Jabba land him in the mobster's rancor pit, and he is forced to exterminate the great beast. This angers the Hutt intensely, and Luke and his crew are immediately sentenced to death by Sarlacc. The prisoners are loaded onto a skiff, and Jabba and his followers board a sail barge to the pit of the Sarlacc, sunken within the hot desert sands of Tatooine. As Luke Skywalker is prodded onto a plank over the deadly pit, an immense creature made of beak and tentacles eagerly waiting below, he offers Jabba one final chance to free the small group of rebels or pay the price of death. This amuses Jabba, but the death sentence stands. A signal to his loyal astromech droid, R2-D2, sends a lightsaber through the air and into the waiting hands of Luke Skywalker, who immediately takes action. As Leia strangles her massive Hutt captor with her slave chain, Luke and Lando battle the skiff guards and take back possession of their droids and friends Han and Chewie.

Soon, the group of friends is back with the rebel alliance planning out their next course of action. All except for Luke, who has traveled back to the swamp planet of Dagobah with R2 in an attempt to finish the Jedi training he began there. It's a difficult reunion for the Jedi padawan. His master, Yoda, is on his deathbed, only waiting for this last chance to speak to Luke before giving himself up to the Force. For Luke, it's a time for closure on a subject that has eaten away at him since his battle with Darth Vader on Cloud City. Yoda confirms his darkest fears. Darth Vader IS Luke Skywalker's father, the once good and caring Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, seduced and corrupted by the wicked Emperor Palpatine decades ago. Yoda also informs Luke that only a final and successful confrontation with his father will make him a true Jedi Knight and stop the Emperor's reign of evil. Yoda passes away, his last breath revealing the secret of one other existing Skywalker child. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi arrives to console Luke as he emerges from Yoda's tiny home. It is Obi-Wan, Luke's first Jedi teacher, who helps reveal to Luke the secret identity of his unknown sibling and guides him to the right course of action.

Luke and R2-D2 return to their friends and the Rebel Alliance in time to join General Han Solo's team on a mission to take out a shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. The shield it provides protects the Emperor's new Death Star, hanging high in the skies above.  As Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and the droids lead a small group of rebel soldiers on their special mission, General Lando Calrissian takes charge of a space battle to replicate the events of the battle of Yavin years earlier. When Solo's team takes down the Death Star's shield, Calrissian will lead the rebel fleet of fighters to the weakest spot of the Death Star to blow it up! With no small amount of uneasiness, Han volunteers his beloved Millennium Falcon for his good friend Lando to pilot on the maneuver, despite having a bad feeling that he'll never see ""her"" again. The groups go their separate ways, Han and the gang sneaking past Imperial security in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Things go wrong from the get-go though, when the discovery of their team by Imperial biker scouts forces Luke and Leia into an exhilarating speeder-bike chase through the Endor forest. Luke makes his way back to the group, but Leia is lost. Luckily, she befriends a small, bear-like creature called Wicket W. Warrick, a young Ewok from the same tribe that soon captures Han, Luke, Chewie, and the Droids. Together again, Luke uses a bit of Force ""magic"" to convince the Ewoks to join the rebel forces in a thrilling woodland battle against the Empire's ground crew in a desperate effort to get the Death Star's shield down in time for Lando's assault on the deadly weapon. Luke has other issues on his mind also, however, and after revealing the truth to his long lost sibling, surrenders himself to Vader and the Emperor in the hopes of  finding the good that he still senses from deep beneath his father's twisted black shell. The future of the entire galaxy relies on the success of the Rebel Alliance in their separate goals, and it all culminates in the final act of ""Return of the Jedi.""

The year was 1983, and fans flocked to theaters to see the 3rd and final film in the legendary Star Wars saga, ""Star Wars, Episode 6: Return of the Jedi."" Completing the spectacular story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, and the malevolent Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, ""Return of the Jedi"" proved to be a very revealing final chapter in the Star Wars mythology. Old secrets were confirmed, new secrets revealed, bonds were strengthened, new ones were formed, the world said goodbye to some beloved characters both good and evil, and a band of tree-dwelling teddy bears proved that all the technology in the universe isn't enough to defeat the  ""human"" spirit! Of course, the main theme of ""Return of the Jedi"" is the main theme of Star Wars itself, redemption, but to delve too much into that just now would probably ruin the film for those who have not yet seen it. Returning with the brilliant music of John Williams and the same outstanding cast as the previous films, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, David Prowse, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Billy Dee Williams, Frank Oz, and the voice of James Earl Jones, ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas chose director Richard Marquand to helm the film this time around. The result was another cinematic masterpiece, though many fans may disagree due to a popular disdain for the lovable Ewok creatures. It's a distaste I still don't understand, but many folks simply don't like anything cute. I offer up this question though: In a galaxy as vast as that of ""Star Wars,"" wouldn't SOME of the creatures be cute? It's inevitable. The Ewoks serve a crucial purpose, regardless of the feelings of many fans. They embody one of George Lucas's major themes in Star Wars: The little guy can't be kept down! Anyway, I must not be the only Ewok lover. The characters enjoyed a popular cartoon series in the 80s (more popular than the ""Droids"" cartoon featuring R2 and 3PO), and had two quite enjoyable made for TV movies! ""Return of the Jedi"" is high on fun, being thoroughly action-packed and full of more bizarre creatures than any Star Wars film before it! It also introduces us to a character only seen before in holographic form (until the prequels came along, that is), the dark Emperor himself, played to fiendish perfection by Ian McDiarmid! And, yes, it's in ""Return of the Jedi"" that we see what's under Darth Vader's mask for the first time! This final chapter in the Star Wars trilogy is not to be missed by fans of the first two films! A rousing, enlightening, and astonishing experience from beginning to end!

In 1997, ""The Star Wars Trilogy"" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the ""Star Wars Saga"" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, ""Return of the Jedi.""

With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or ""classic"" Star Wars Trilogy came even more ""improvements"" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. In addition to the previous changes, which included an added musical number within Jabba's palace, improvements to the Sarlacc creature, and new cityscape celebrations and music in the film's finale,  ""Return of the Jedi"" now features changes to bring it more in line with the Star Wars prequels. Along with improving the overall look of the Rancor scene, the spirit of an aged Anakin Skywalker in the end of the film has been (quite shockingly) replaced with that of a much younger Anakin, circa Episode 3, played by actor Hayden Christensen. My personal opinion of all the changes to the film over the years: I'm not a huge fan of the added musical sequence. It seemed rather unnecessary and more cartoony than anything else in Star Wars. The only thing that bothers me more is the two-headed Podrace announcer in Episode 1. That bothered me MUCH more. Taking that into account, I am not extremely bothered by the musical number in Jedi, but it was better without it. I am rather pleased with the much needed adjustments to the Rancor scene, which was really just a matter of making the elements blend together much better than they did before. The Sarlacc changes are welcome by me too. It's definitely a more intimidating creature than it used to be when it was just a big hole in the ground with a few tentacles. As for the changes that relate more to tying the prequels to the original trilogy, the new elements, young Anakin's ghost and the cities of the galaxy in celebration, are excellent additions when one watches all six Star Wars films together. However, the original elements hold a place in all our hearts and this is why offering up the original films as a DVD option would have been so greatly appreciated. Still, over all, aside from only a few complaints here and there, I have no serious problems with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all). Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. ""Jedi"" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable and can clue a viewer in on key elements, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, if you want the other great extras, you'll have to get the whole trilogy set, but don't get your hopes up. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking deleted and original scenes, the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with (you know, ""It's Lando Calrissian in disguise!""), AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring.

I have seen all of the Star Wars movies, from the Phantom Menace to Attack Of The Clones to Revenge Of The Sith to A New Hope to The Empire Strikes Back, and now this golden piece of treasure, which is my favorite Star Wars movie ever. The fight scenes are just great, there are a lot more cool new and old characters, Darth Vader is better than ever, I love the funny quotes and interesting moments, and the ending is both sweet and happy. The others were great, but this is the very best. Do not wait another moment. See this movie. It is well worth any money you spend on it. Period. End of discussion. Done.",1128643200,,661,4.171875
2202542,1,B00076SCPW,"As to be honest, i didn't watch the movie to the end. After the girl (whatever her name is) choked jabba the hutt I turned of the television. It left me thinking: what do all these fans see in this mess?

Its not a science fiction movie, it is more like a doll theatre. The dancing number and the whole jabba the hutt surroundings reminded me more of sesame street than science fiction. I know the translator robot is ment to be funny and R2 ment to be cute, but i just find them boring. However, the worst thing was the retarded animal called ""chewbacca"". Every time he started his ugly howl i just wanted to get into the tv screen and chop his head of with that kind of ""cool"" laser sword.

Star Wars may be of historical interest. I could compare it with plan 9 from outer space. Plan nine is better though, because that film is funny, this one is just irritating. That there are so many devoted fans out there amazes me.",1125792000,,924,4.244318181818182
2202543,5,B00076SCPW,"This final entry in George Lucas's original STAR WARS trilogy is often cited as the weakest of the three.  That said, it is still a very enjoyable, well-made piece of entertainment that acquits itself brilliantly as a closure to the saga.

The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic.  Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too.  It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product.  Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster.  It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.

Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks.  Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga.  I honestly never had a problem with them and they never threaten to sink the film in the same way that Jar Jar Binks' sometimes overdone comic antics in EPISODE I did.

By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor.  The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie.  Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance.  Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid.  The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.

The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors.  The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout.  Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence.  The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO.  Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it.  And yes, there's also John Williams' music.

In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) ""Special Editions"", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements.  The new additions in this Special Edition are hit and miss--I liked most of the shots of the additional galaxies celebrating at the end and the enhanced Sarlacc Pit Monster, but I'm iffy about the new musical number in the ""Jabba"" section as well as Hayden Christiansen's ghost in the final scene.  It feels unnecessary, and he doesn't really blend with the rest of the movie.  That said, RETURN OF THE JEDI's entertainment value is not hampered in any way by such alterations; it's as solid a finale to a classic trilogy as we'll ever get.",1125705600,,3816,4.782012195121951

Sadly, though, this is one of the worst-acted, worst-dialogue films I have ever seen (followed very closely by ROCKY IV, but that's another issue entirely)!  The plot seems like recycled pieces of STAR WARS and EMPIRE, and even John Williams's score has very little new musical themes.

C3PO's character has been degredated to that of a feminine interior decorator and Darth Vader has become a completely passive pussy (excuse my French) whose only purpose is to say ""Yes, Master"" and ""As you wish.""

So for those who wish to keep knocking THE PHANTOM MENACE for all its flaws, just re-watch JEDI and you'll see really bad film making.",1121644800,,769,4.892307692307693
2202546,5,B00076SCPW,"OK! Even though people say that this movie was for kids, well, so what?

The point is that it could entertain people and that's the important thing. It did!

This episode was where everything was revealed. The fact that Leia was Luke's twin sister. TWIN!

When I heard this part, I kinda jumped of my chair. It was quite touching too because when you first watch episode 4, you'd think that Luke and Leia would live happily ever after but then you just realize that they are actually related!

George Lucas still had a wide range of ideas to put into the movie with special effects to go with it. I really loved the image of the incomplete Death Star. It looked like an apple eaten at its side.

Even though star wars is known for all its fighting and wars, this episode will make you look at the brighter side of star wars and its fun.

2202547,5,B00076SCPW,"This film tends to be less popular with Star Wars fans when compared to Episodes IV and V, and it's a good argument. Episode IV is the classic that started it all, and The Empire Strikes Back is the most popular Star Wars film by far. Some of the arguments that people use for not liking Return of the Jedi are the fact that the rebels where trying to do basically the same thing they had accomplished in Episode IV (destroy the Deathstar). Another popular argument used against Return of the Jedi are the Ewoks (and rightfully so, those things are cute only for 5 seconds and get old fast!). But beyond that, this is a great film. The final meeting with Sidious, Vader, and Luke is very dramatic, and the rebel's engaging the Imperial fleet is also cool. One other thing, does it really make that big of a difference that they put in Hayden Christinsen instead of that old guy from the original version? I understand some of the old fans don't like it, but they act like the entire film is not worth watching anymore just because of that minor twitch.",1120694400,,1052,4.427835051546392

We now officially know the entire story and that the true main character is Anakin Skywalker and that he truly is the chosen one. When his own son Luke fights him and the Emperor steps in. Anakin finally realizes exactly where he belongs along side the forces of good as the most powerful Jedi ever. Alot of people tend to complain that the last three installments have been redone, but I don't understand why? Lucas was just trying to make them look as he envisioned them and the fans did get their Wookies in 'Revenge of the Sith'. Jabba's palace is always great (now even better knowing that Lucas left Leia the way she was in 1983)and there is nothing wrong with trying to prove that even the smallest of creatures like Ewoks can change the corse of history.

Now has been told George Lucas did a smashing job as making one of the greatest stories ever to be put on film. Now hopefully he will rerelase the entire saga on the 30th anniversery year so we can all have an excuse to see them again.",1119571200,,1204,4.323008849557522
2202549,3,B00076SCPW,"The third and final film in George Lucas' classic Star Wars trilogy has lots going for it, but also a few things that make it pale in comparison to Episode IV (A New Hope) and Episode V (The Empire Strikes Back).

Visually, Return of the Jedi is superior to both Episode IV and V. The Climactic space battle between the Death Star II and the Rebel Fleet looks fantastic, as does the speeder bike sequence on Endor.

Unfortunately, the fantastic visuals aren't matched with an equally fantastic story. The basic story isn't bad, but it's the overall vibe of the movie that detracts from the story. What I mean is, the way the story is presented, the end never seems in doubt even for a moment.

A New Hope works in large part because the Galactic Empire seems truly intimidating: Darth Vader fails to display even a modicum of human emotion or behavior, and the Death Star's powers are effectively demonstrated with the ease in which the battlestation destroya Princess Leia's home planet of Alderran.  The Empire Strikes Back, similarly, creates a feeling of dread and hopelessness in the viewer, especially with the gigantic walkers (impractical though they were) that are attacking the rebel base on Hoth. The sheer size and beast-like countenance of these vehicles are actually frightening. In both movies, the Empire is presented as a serious opponent that gives the viewer no doubt as to why they are in charge of the galaxy and why the odds are stacked so insurmountably against the rebellion. The rebel alliance, arguably, should have really been defeated at Yavin when the Death Star reached firing range, however they survived and triumphed due to Luke Skywalker's abilities with the Force and his miracle ""exhaust port shot."" This is acceptable to viewers who demand a certain level of realism (but accept absolutely the make-believe elements of science fiction movies) because it is faith rather than machinery and pragmatism (and good rathter than evil) that actually triumphs.

It goes without saying that in The Empire Strikes Back it was the Imperials who rightfully emerged triumphant because of their superior resources and the iron will of Darth Vader, and also because it was necessary for Luke to be placed in a vulnerable and seemingly inescapable position against Vader.

The problem with Return of the Jedi, in my opinion, is that it seems more of a children's movie than anything else. The results are never in doubt, mostly because the movie fails to make many viewers respect the power of the Empire, and the entire movie takes on a carnival atmosphere with no latent feeling of fear and dread that the first death star, the Imperial walkers, or stormtroopers created. This is done at many points in the movie:

1 - The efficacy of Imperial ""elite"" troops is seriously put to question when they are bested by the ewoks, who somehow harness the power of cuteness to deflect blaster bolts and defeat stormtroopers with what amounts to a bunch of Dennis the Menace slingshots.

2 - Darth Vader seems somehow less threatening in this movie. In the first Star Wars movie it was hard to imagine Darth Vader sleeping or eating lunch or talking with his buddies in the Death Star's break room when off duty, but in this movie it is easy to imagine him sitting on the toilet while reading his wife's copy of Glamour because the Emperor stole his copy of GQ and there's nothing else to read. This is probably because in the first two movies he seems more like a robot where as in this one he seems like some tall guy wearing a costume.

3 - the second Death Star doesn't seem the least bit threatening. Part of this is because the Imperial engineers don't seem to have learned their lesson from the first Death Star's loss, and wnet ahead to design the second battle station not only with the same exhaust port leading to what is vaguely described as a ""main reactor,"" but make it large enough for an entire squadron of starfighters to fly through, unlike the first Death Star which was so small only missiles could get in. Perhaps if the Death Star fired at some random planet much larger than Alderran it would demonstrate to the audience that this second Death Star is stronger than the first one. This might at least distract the audience from the fact that the manner in which this battle station is destroyed in the same way that the first one was

4- Luke Skywalker seems like a gigantic wuss. It is difficult to imagine a Dark Lord of the Sith being out-duelled by this sniveling dork.

5 - Han Solo - Harrison Ford looks like he's tired of his stupid vest, and doesn't seem to be very into his role. Either that or he isn't all that good an actor.

6- Lando -- Billy Dee Williams demonstrates once and for all that just because you can sell cheap beer on TV commercials it doesn't mean you can fool an audience into thinking you're a starfighter pilot.

7 - The video game atmosphere of the space battles -- the Empire can't seem to shoot straight and loses flocks of TIE fighters left and right, where as every Rebel craft shot down is something of an event to be mourned over. These people are supposed to be the Empire's finest pilots?

8 - The Star Destroyer ""Executioner"" (the big blue-colored one that Darth Vader rose in) goes down just because an a-wing crashes into its bridge. This is tantamount to a nuclear aircraft carrier going down because it took a kamikaze to the control tower. Of course it would be disabled or at least severely damaged, but it's hard to imagine the whole thing going down. The Executioner is many times larger than any aircraft carrier and the idea that one crashing fighter can destroy the whole thing when its ""shield is down"" begs the question why the Rebels don't just crash into every star destroyer's bridge after knocking down the shields.

Overall this movie is entertaining and worth watching, but it would probably be better if the Empire seemed like a geniune threat with genuine power, rather than the inept foils for the Rebels' attack that they became in this film.",1119312000,,6041,4.685849056603773

We meet the Emperor himself, and Luke and Darth Vader confront each other again after the huge reveltion in Episode V.  There is another revelation in this movie, but not quite as huge.  We see many beloved characters die, and because of this, it has a sad touch.  This may also be because, although it has a happy ending, this is the last one.

2202553,5,B00076SCPW,"This is a great movie and a great end to the trilogy.  When you think about it (and the creator of Star Wars has said this) Darth Vader is the main character.  George Lucas, the creator, said so on an interview i was watching. If you watch Episode 1: Phantom Menace it shows how the jedis found Anakin Skywalker and how he was when he was a young boy(about 8 or 9) In Episode 2: Attack of the Clones it shows Anakin Skywalker 10 years later when he is about 20 when Obi-Wan had gotten back from training him and he was a jedi and then he and Padme fall in love and get married at the end. Then in Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith (i saw it at midnight) it shows him turning over to the dark side and also Padme is pregnant in this (with Luke and Leia) So you know...oh and to the person who wrote a review and they weren't sure how Darth Vader dies (they said that all he got was his hand chopped off and if maybe his life force was connected to the Emperor) well,  i am about to say how he dies. Well, before he was Darth Vader he was a normal person, and was a jedi. Then in Episode 3 him and Obi-Wan Kenobi are fighting after Anakin had chosen to turn to the dark side and then Anakin catches on fire and is burned all over...very badly.. imean his skin turned black, his hair was burned off, and he was injured badly and he barely lived. So that suit is what helps him breath, and stay alive so its kinda like life support. and he needs it because he was so badly burned and injured. When Darth Vader throws the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi the emperor strikes him a little with force lightning and it messes up his suit and makes it so that the suit can't help him anymore.

2202554,5,B00076SCPW,"""Never. I'll never turn to the Dark Side. You've failed your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.""

""So be it. Jedi.""

- Luke Skywalker informs The Emperor its a dawning of a new day for the Jedi, but, The Emperor is less than enthusiastic for the ""Return of The Jedi""

The ""Star Wars"" saga comes to a close in this satisfying conclusion to the most popular Sci-fi space opera in film history.

Luke Skywalker, with the help of his friends, returns to his home planet of Tatooine to rescue his friend Han Solo from the gangster Jabba The Hutt.

Luke also travels back to Dagobah to continue his training in the Jedi arts, but, a shocking surprise waits for him.

Across the galaxy, The Galactic Empire is readying its latest weapon - a new Death Star, that is twice as big as the first one, & will spell certain doom to the band of freedom fighters trying to restore peace to the galaxy. When word is found out that both, Darth Vader & The Emperor, are overseeing the construction of this new battle station, The Rebel Alliance band together for a last ditch effort to crush the Empire once & for all.

""Jedi"" ties up a lot loose ends, but, is actually the weakest film out of the original trilogy. The problem with the film is its overkill in some sequences. Case in point the Jabba's Palace denizens are all reminiscent of the Cantina sequence in ""Star Wars"" (I don't acknowledge its ""Epiosde IV"". Gimme a f**ing break!) & the Death Star battle is a bigger version of the end battle from the first film. The lightsabre battle at the end of ""Jedi"" can't top the one from ""Empire"" (the best battle in the entire saga).
That doesn't mean they suck, though. There is plenty of action & its all plain ass good.

As for the Leia/Luke scene, where Leia tells Luke about her real mother, she has got to be talking about her stepmother & not her real mother. This leads one to believe that Leia was never told that she was adopted & I can only assume that Leia might think that mama Organa is mother to both Luke and her, instead of Padme, with Vader being both their father. Leia also tells Luke that she remembers her (adoptive) mother only a little bit, saying that she was beautiful, but, sad. This lead me to believe that Leia's adoptive mother died early in her infancy, taking that dark secret of Leia's real parentage to her grave. With Bail Organa (Leia's adoptive father from Episode III) dying in the destruction of Alderaan in the first ""Star Wars"" film, Leia will never know who her real mother is.

As for her ""knowing"" about ""The Force"" all along, she's probablly referring to the end scene in ""Empire"" when Luke calls out to Leia to save him.

The differences in ""Jedi"" in the past 22 years:

The Special Edition release in 1997 excised the ""Lapti Nek"" musical number from Jabba's Palace (bad) & is replaced with ""Jedi Rocks"" (a lot of die-hard fans call this ""Jedi Sucks""). Overall, no improvement either way.

Also in the S.E. release, the ""Yub-Nub"" Ewok song is excised and replaced with the more stomachable ""Ewok Celebration"" with new footage of cities & planets that were used all through the saga including Tatooine (duh!), Cloud City, Naboo, & Coruscant (keep a sharp eye out as a statue of The Emperor is toppled down, Saddam Hussein style, & watch as a few Stormtroopers get lynch mobbed). Overall, likable improvement that at the time gave audiences its first official sneak peek at the prequels.

Sorry, the Ewoks are still here.

One addition is a small pan shot of a herd of Banthas grazing in the desert sands of Tatooine, just before Jabba's sail barge comes cruising over the dune sea.

For this new 2004 DVD release:

Darth Vader's eyebrows get CGI synged, when finally unmasked by Luke & in an oddball CGI move Sebastian Shaw who plays an aged ghost of Anakin Skywalker is replaced by Hayden Christensen from episodes ""II"" & ""III"". The only reason I can think of as to why George Lucas would do this, is that when Anakin crossed over to the dark side he did so at a young age. But, that still doesn't explain that if Anakin is redeemed by Luke at such an old age, why doesn't he materialize as part of ""The Force"" at the age that he was redeemed at? In other words, Lucas got this right the first time around.

""Return Of The Jedi"" is presented, best, in the widescreen format with Dolby Digital EX surround & is THX certified to blow you through the back wall of your living room.",1116460800,,4421,4.472049689440993

2202557,3,B00076SCPW,"The worst of the original trilogy and quite possibly the most blatant example of toy marketing for a movie I've ever encountered. I'm talking about the f*cking Ewoks of course. Six months before the movie came out a friend of mine who worked at Toys ""R Us remarked that these awful teddy bear plushy things were being sold as the new Star Wars toys. I swallowed my trepidation, paid no attention to my instincts and went and saw the movie anyway. Oh god, what a disappointing ending to what I thought at the time was the greatest serial since the original Flash Gordon.

I'm going to touch on a few things that I found irritating. The Return of the Jedi is replete with plot holes and logical inconsistencies. For example: I don't see how the empire could be so powerful if they can't shoot straight or stop a bunch of tiny bow wielding stuffed animal things from wiping out ""a legion of the best troops in the empire."" Come on, the Ewoks crushed an armored walker with logs fer chistsake. Try crushing an Abrams tank with logs, or an armored personnel carrier: not going to happen. If Lucas had any respect for reality or logic those frigging Ewoks would have been wiped out to a man and their stinking hides been made into carpets. I would have cheered the entire operation. Another thing, this movie hinges around destroying yet another death star. No invasion of the Emperors palace, no grand final apocalyptic battle. No, the rebels gotta do the same thing they did in the first movie: destroy the death star. Earth to Lucas: WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT. And how convenient for Leia, Han and Chewy and company that the forest was populated with vicious blood thirsty teddy bears.  Otherwise they would never have gotten in the empires force field generation building.  What an absurd mission, didn't they think for a second that the object protecting the new death star would be guarded?  They seemingly went into the operation with only the flimsiest of plans, ridiculous.

Now onto the human element, George himself said that he was better at directing objects than people.  But I think he did a fine job with the first Star Wars movie at getting performances out of his actors. The director of this movie:  Richard Marquand may be good for action scenes but he hasn't a clue when it comes to directing people, and boy does it show in the stilted and wooden acting. When Leia finds out she's Luke's sister, she has all the emotional resonance of someone who's just been told that they have a bit of food on their cheek.  Jeesh, with a little direction that could have been a powerful scene but as usual, the director relies on the music to provide the emotion for us.  On the upside the Emperor is very cool as is the final confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader. Although why Vader dies is still not clear to me, he only had his artificial hand chopped off, so what? Was his life force somehow connected to the Emperor? Who knows?

I felt after watching this movie that Lucas purposefully dumbed it down to appeal to children and thus sell more toys to which he had exclusive rights. It worked; he bought a 6500-acre ranch in Marin County California with his star wars lucre and more power to him. The special effects are wonderful for the time, but he let me and his fans above the age of ten down with this movie, big-time. The amazing special effects do not make up for a poor script and direction. Now as for this DVD, it's not the original movie, special effects have been added and scenes have been changed, deleted. I'm not going to touch on that, others have already done so in great detail.

Blast it! However, the end will piss you off, as well as several scenes. Like the idiotic chick band in Jaba's palace. First of all the origianl music they had there was so much better. Jaba was suppose to be a mysterious evil figure. Not some legoland gay fruitball. The otherthing is yes, the ending, The ewok song was replaced with this stupid classical music. THe whole gang is all happy running around and they took out the song they were singing at the end, the ""up cha"" song.

You cant make the film depressing if the actors are jumping around with joy.

Yes, the punk kid. They replaced Anikan's ghost wiht the idiot they casted as darth vader.

First off, the guy looks like one of the Fab-5 trying to act like a badass.

Second he wasn't in the freaking movie!!!!

I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about ""Star War: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"" some I agree with, others I don't. I was 8-years-old and along with my teenaged cousins I was first in line at the theater we went to in Los Angeles and after that summer I had to wait till the television & VHS versions to see this movie again.

Still when I saw the original cut of this movie it was like WOW! The greatest movie ever and I was ecstatic when Lucas re-released it in the theaters. Those who complain about the re-cut of the movie most likely saw this movie for the first time in the theater, but those my age and under either do not remember or did not see it in the theater and were never given the chance till the re-cut.

The re-cut was necessary for us in the younger generation after being spoiled by movies like ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and the ""Star Trek"" & ""Babylon 5"" TV shows & movies of the late 1980s through the 1990s. I for one loved the updated scenes and the inclusion of both the re-editing of and replacing of Sebastian Shaw's Anakin with a make-up aged Hayden Christiansen Anakin & the planetary celebrations not only on the moon of Endor, but also on Tatoonie, Bespin, Coruscant and Naboo.  And quite frankly I have read things like ""give me back my `Star War'"" and ""give us back our `Star Wars'"" but what these people tend to forget is that ""Star Wars"" does not belong to ""us,"" we are but viewers into the dream of George Lucas and ""Star Wars"" belongs to him to do with as he sees fit.

Nonetheless this movie is what brought the Skywalker family back together and I whole hardily recommend this movie and also recommend that people watch only the wide screen versions and in a home theater atmosphere to get the most enjoyment out of this modern classic movie.",1110931200,,1809,4.340236686390533
2202563,5,B00076SCPW,This movie is so much fun! Its action packed and very funny! I loved it!,1110672000,,72,3.8666666666666667
2202564,4,B00076SCPW,"Of the three major Star Wars movies, Jedi is the lesser. Why is difficult to define... it has great action sequences like the Battle Of Endor and the rescue from Jabba The Hutt. It also boasts the climactic confrontation involving The Emperor, Darth Vader, and Luke Skywalker. It even introduces the overly cute Ewoks for the first time (although it is significant that George Lucas has edited their appearences down a tad in the dvd release). Yet Jedi justs sits there behind the other two films in terms of overall entertainment. Nor do I think mine is a solitary view on this. When I was a student, I worked part time in a cinema to help fund me through my studies and both Empire and Jedi were films that were shown during my time there. Jedi simply did not do the level of business that Star Wars and Empire achieved. While it was busy, it never quite seemed to fill up. People seeing it for the most part all said it was good but not like the previous films in terms of entertainment.

I view Jedi as a film that could and should have been better and I put the why down to the way it is directed. Richard Marquand was a fine action director but if you compare the direction to say that of Empire Strikes Back then flaws emerge.

I often wonder what Jedi would have been like if George Lucas had let the director of Empire Strikes Back - Irvin Kershner helm that film too....

To put it simply I think that Irvin Kershner did a better job of Empire Strikes Back, nothing in Jedi for example comes close to the chase through the asteroid field for example.

I also think that on the strength of the dark scenes from Empire such as the Vader/Skywalker confrontation and others, that Kershner would have taken the really good confrontation at the end of Jedi between The Emperor, Vader, and Luke and made it truly great. Missing from that is the dark moodiness of the similar scenes in Empire which if they had been realised in Jedi, would have lifted it up the scale significantly in content and enjoyment factor.

To sum up, good as that end sequence is in Jedi, it could have been even better with Irvin Kershner helming it... and that pretty much sums up the film as a whole basically.

As to the controversy of the editing that Lucas has made to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:

I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three. However, with nearly 20 years between Jedi and The Phantom Menace there were always going to be continuity issues concerning casting and SFX. Play an original vhs version of Star Wars, and you will soon see that the mattes have not aged well and stand out visibly. Yet did we notice them at the the time of the films release? No of course not because the SFX then were state of the art. Now with the passage of time and SFX having come on in leaps and bounds, George Lucas decided to update the former films. In my opinion he has done a good job too SFX wise. The casting editing is more to link with the newer editions of the franchise than to improve the quality of the originals, so my thoughts on that are mixed though. I can see the reason for doing it but I simply prefer the original actors in their roles. Clive Revill's Emperor in Empire Strikes Back I think is the deletion that was most unnecessary.

Overall though I am glad that I have a choice and can either watch the originals on vhs or put on the updated versions on dvd.

I have looked forward to the dvd release of these films for years and am delighted with finally being able to blast them across my home cinema set up. The picture on 16:9 anamorphic is great on a widescreen tv. All sound channels are crisp and totally clear of any distortion. Laser blasts and Tie Fighters shoot across the room to varying degrees...Such is the effect of being able to do that, it has returned me to the awe struck kid seeing Star Wars for the first time in a cinema. Thanks for the dvds, George, it may have taken a while but at least they are here now.",1107648000,,3973,4.336473755047106

Why they did this I don't know.  I think it ruins the entire movie seeing that whiny snot-nosed kid sitting there instead of Sebastian Shaw!",1104451200,,486,4.271739130434782
2202567,5,B00076SCPW,"In this final epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy, the final confrontation between young Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his evil nemesis/father Darth Vader takes place as the rebel alliance struggles against the evil galactic empire and their new death star, which is even more powerful than the original.

The film opens with Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Luke venturing to the hide-out of Jabba the Hutt to free Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who was captured by Boba Fett in episode V.  After being freed from the carbonite by Leia, a battle breaks out among Jabba's forces and Luke, Leia, Lando, and Han.  During the melee, Jabba is choked to death by a scantily-clad Leia while the others manage to fight off Jabba's thugs and escape.

After escaping from Jabba, Han, Leia, and Lando rendezvous with the rest of the rebel fleet while Luke goes back to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, but when he gets there an ailing Yoda tells him that he needs no more training, but still must face Darth Vader.  Meanwhile, the others plan thier assault on the death star, with Lando leading the ship attack and Han leading the ground assault to de-activate the energy shield which is protecting the death star.  The band must land on the forest moon of Endor to knock out the power generator which generates the energy field.

Luke joins up with Leia and Han, but he feels that he is endangering the mission with his presence, so he voluntarily surrenders so he can face Vader and the Emperor.  Will Luke's surrender succeed?  Will Han's group disable the energy field before Lando's ships arrive? Will Luke be turned to the dark side or will he find good in his father and turn him?

This is a fantastic movie.  The special effects have gotten better as the series went on, and the stunning battle against the death star is one of the best sequences I've ever seen.  I didn't care as much for the Endor part of the movie, but the flight of the speeders through the forest with the trees zipping by at very high speeds was fun to watch.  The best part of the movie is the confrontation between Luke and Vader, with each trying to turn the other.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  From the opening ""Star Wars"" flash to the end, it is loaded with action and adventure.  Watch and see the climactic battle between good and evil occur as the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.",1101081600,,2443,4.607390300230947

The third of the original Star Wars trilogy, Return of the Jedi is a great closing to the series. The story comes down to a final climax in the battle between the Empire and the rebel alliance. The music score is awesome thanks to the expertice of John Williams and it really set the tone for many movies after it. The best part though was the story, an epic struggle between good and evil in a galaxy far, far away. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, I've seen it close to 200 times.",1097971200,,567,4.154545454545454
2202569,4,B00076SCPW,"""Return of the Jedi"" is the one film of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy that was not improved by the tinkering of George Lucas.  It has always been the most unsatisfying of the three films, partially because the expectations were unrealistically high (I still have my ""Revenge of the Jedi"" button), but also because it provides an uneasy mix of the best elements from its two predecessors.  As much fun as the original ""Star Wars"" was (no, still will not use its new name), ""The Empire Strikes"" back was a much darker and richer film where things went from bad (the attack on the Rebel base on Hoth) to worse (Han Solo frozen, Luke Skywalker loses his hand and finds out who is his daddy).  Given how bad things were going for our collective band of heroes, the levity in this films seems rather misplaced.  This is heightened when Lucas adds the musical number to the early scene at Jabba the Hutt's pleasure palace.  The idea might be to update the Cantina band sequences from the first film, but given that Han is a wall decoration it just does not work.

Usually the blame for ""Return of the Jedi"" is placed on the Ewoks, because cute teddy bears seems a giant step backwards by this point in the narrative.  But I think the more substantial problems are with the rampant revisionism Lucas is doing with his story line.  There are a pair of problems associated with the earlier movies.  First, we have the declaration from Obi-Wan Kenobi that Darth Vader killed Luke's father.  We then learn in ""Empire"" that Vader IS Luke's father and in ""Jedi"" the ghost of Obi-Wan comes up with a lame excuse that what he said was true from a certain point of perspective as if it was an election year in that galaxy far, far away.  Second, we have the revelation that Princess Leia is Luke's sister.  This would be the same Luke that Leia liplocked in ""Empire.""  Leia professing her love for Han was enough to end the love triangle that existed at the beginning of that movie, but if you need another nail in that particular coffin this would certainly do it.  But again I get the feeling that Lucas is revising as he goes along.

I always thought of ""Return of the Jedi"" as a 4.5 film, a notch belong the previous two, but was inclined to round up because of the final fight between Luke and Vader, as well as the way that relationship plays out in the end.  But the new musical number skewing the film's tone even farther in the wrong direction negates that rationale so now I round down.  The special effects are again an improvement, albeit not as much as from ""Star Wars"" to ""Empire,"" and the attack on the new Death Star certainly shows how proficient Industrial Light and Magic had become.  In terms of the performances both Luke (Mark Hamill) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) continue their arcs of maturation, but Han (Harrison Ford) is back to being a scamp.

In the publicity for the DVD versions of the original ""Star Wars"" movies Ford has commented about how he thought Han Solo should have been killed off in ""Return of the Jedi.""  I think he was right on this score because given the depths of ""Empire"" things break rather well for our heroes in this one.  The death of Yoda and Darth Vader are certainly steps in the right direction, but we were expecting Vader to die since the first film (albeit more directly by Luke's hand) and Yoda's death, while unexpected, was not exactly significant.  It seemed that Lucas was setting up the death of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) with Han's premonition about never seeing the Millenium Falcon again, but that did not pan out.  Which is just as good since one of the best shots of the film is the Millenium Falcon escaping from the new Death Star, shooting out just ahead of all those flames.

Of course in the end what matters here is the entire ""Star Wars"" trilogy, which is still going to be better than the new one, no matter what happens next year in ""Revenge of the Sith.""  Notice that in the new trilogy Lucas continues to have problems making everything fit together (i.e., what happened to sweet little Anakin Skywalker between ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" and why does Padm Amidala see anything in the brooding thug he has become?).  What George Lucas accomplished the first time around was pretty impressive when you consider that at the end of the first ""Star Wars"" we thought we knew exactly what would happen.  Darth Vader would beat Luke Skywalker in a light saber duel at the end of the second film and then Luke would kill Vader at the climax of the third.  But then came the biggest pair of body blows in movie history when Vader and Luke fought in ""Empire"" and the grand finale was suddenly in doubt.  There are certainly flaws to be found here, but there is also the grandeur of a first class space opera.",1097020800,,4795,4.5237543453070685

- The Emperor underestimates The Skywalker bloodline in ""Return of the Jedi""
George Lucas' sci-fi saga comes to a satisfying close in Episode VI, ""Return of the Jedi"".
""Jedi"" opens with Luke Skywalker returning to his home planet of Tatooine to rescue his friend Han Solo from the gangster, Jabba the Hutt and his creature co-horts. After bargaining negotiations fail, a  spectacular battle commences as the young Jedi (with the help of Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2-D2 & C-3PO) fights a huge monster called The Rancor and then does a battle royale with Jabba and his horde of weird galactic denizens and servants. The film then jumps to Luke returning to the swamp planet Dagobah to complete his training as a Jedi, only to discover that his master, Yoda, has fallen deathly ill. In his final breaths Yoda reveals the truth about Luke's family ties and gets reassurance, &  a final bit of guidance from the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. In order to complete his training, Luke must face Darth Vader again, as well as, Vader's master, Emperor Palpatine. Meanwhile, The Rebel Alliance has prepared for an all out final assault on the Galactic Empire after recieving secret information of a new battle armored space station secretly being built by the Empire. If completed, this new Death Star will spell certain doom to the small band of freedom fighters, as well as, the fate of the galaxy.
First off, its hard to top ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (I'm a die-hard fan of the films (yeah, the prequels too, but don't get me started!). ""Jedi"" comes close to those first two films, but, not close enough (its still better than the prequels!). Directed by the late Richard Marquand, ""Jedi"" is packed with both special and creature effects alike. The problem is ""Jedi"" is much like the first two films, but, on a more massive scale. The film's main premise is to tie up all the loose ends of the saga, and it does a great job of doing just that. Highpoints in the film include John Williams' oscar nominted score, the speeder bike chase, the space battle, Jabba the Hutt, the battle on Endor & the redemption of Anakin Skywalker. Lowpoints - the death of Boba Fett (embarrasing to the point where the character is resurrected in the Marvel comic book and survives in the expanded universe), the Ewok Celebration at the films conclusion and the Lapti Nek number in Jabba's palace is an ominous shadow of Lucas' cutesy side that weighs heavily on the prequels (I remember a lot of fans seeing this & going ""What the f**k!?!"").
The biggest highlight of all is Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia dressed in the metal bikini as Jabba's slavegirl. What a hottie! During filming there actually was a stagehand who had to make sure that she felt comfy in that bikini, making sure that she wasn't getting hurt to vital parts of her bod (that had to be one of the best jobs on the planet at the time of filming).
Originally titled ""Revenge of the Jedi"", making the folks at Paramount Studios retitle ""Star Trek II: The Revenge of Khan"" to the ""Wrath of Khan"". Lucas changed the title, stating Jedi don't seek revenge. Nominated for 7 Oscars including original score, costume design, set design, and recieving a special Oscar for the film's SFX (presented to Dennis Muren by Cheech & Chong!). Released on 5/25/83 (for the Memorial Day weekend) ""Return of the Jedi"" has grossed 309 million at the U.S. box office.
""Return of the Jedi"" is a satisfying capper to the classic ""Star Wars Trilogy"" and the conclusion to the most influential and best science fiction saga in film history.",1082937600,,3625,4.734177215189874

2202576,4,B00076SCPW,"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, written by Larry Kasdan and George Lucas and directed by the late Richard Marquand, closes the Classic Trilogy that chronicles the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia during the Galactic Civil War, which pit the Heroes of the Rebellion against Emperor Palpatine and his evil minion, Darth Vader.  Although many fans consider Jedi to be weaker than The Empire Strikes Back, it is still a fitting conclusion to the beloved film series.
Even though Return of the Jedi was released 16 years before Episode I: The Phantom Menace, George Lucas intended it to be part of a six-film cycle, very much as J.R.R. Tolkien intended each volume of his Lord of the Rings ""trilogy"" to be part of one single novel.  It clearly ties up all the events from both Prequel and Classic Trilogies, leaving it to authorized novelists to continue the Star Wars story in the Expanded Universe books and graphic novels.
As the film opens, it is a dark time for the Rebellion.  Imperial forces under the command of Jedi-turned-Sith Lord Darth Vader (Dave Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones) have defeated the Rebel Alliance at Hoth and elsewhere.  The Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) has ordered Vader to capture Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and turn him to the Dark Side of the Force before the boy becomes too powerful and destroys the two Sith Lords.  To achieve this goal, Vader uses every means at his disposal -- the Imperial Fleet and bounty hunters -- to capture Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and use them as bait to lure Skywalker to Cloud City on Bespin...and into a carefully laid trap.
Luke manages to escape, but now Han is frozen in carbonite and in the clutches of the vile Tatooine gang lord Jabba the Hutt.  And as he, Leia, Chewbacca and new ally Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), they are unaware that Palpatine has ordered the construction of a second, more powerful Death Star.  If the Empire completes this planet-killing space station, the Rebellion is doomed.
The first half of Jedi focuses on Han's rescue from Jabba's Palace on Luke's home world.  It starts out subtly, with C-3PO (clueless as ever) and his feisty astromech counterpart R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) being ""given"" as a gift to the Hutt as a token of goodwill by Luke, who hopes -- against evidence to the contrary -- that Jabba will see reason and negotiate.  Then, a bounty hunter called Boussh arrives with Han's Wookiee pal Chewbacca, but later, when Han is thawed out in an abortive rescue attempt, it is revealed that Boussh is really Leia in disguise and she is forced to wear a skimpy outfit (later made famous in an episode of ""Friends"") and chained to the slug-like crime lord.
The film finally becomes full of action once Luke arrives at the palace to get his friends out of this mess.  His first attempt to use his Jedi powers seems to fail, but later, at the Pit of Carkoon -- the nesting place of the awful Sarlacc -- the young Jedi uses the Force and his new lightsaber to help destroy Jabba and most of his minions.  Han, Lando and Leia have some of their best moments in this sequence, with some of the best lines going to Ford's roguish smuggler-turned-Rebel-hero:
Luke (to Han): Han!
Han: Luke! How we doin'?
Luke: Same as always.
Han: That bad, huh?
***
Han: I think my eyes ARE getting better. Instead of a big black blur I see a bright blur.
Luke: There's not much to see. I grew up here, you know.
Han: You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Mayhem ensues, but the Rebels manage to escape with their lives.  But Luke has unfinished business with his Jedi Master Yoda, and the Rebels have just decoded the data stolen by Bothan spies.  The Empire is building a new battle station near the moon of Endor, and the Emperor is supervising the final stages of its construction.....
Return of the Jedi was altered in the late 1990s with CGI graphics to test some of the new digital effects and technology that would later be used in the current prequels, although most of the changes come at the very end, where the victory celebration on Endor is now supplemented by simultaneous parties on Bespin and Tatooine.  There is a new musical number that replaces the original version's ""Lapti Nek""  and the Victory Celebration features new material composed by John Williams.",1073520000,,4401,4.727154046997389

This Episode ties all the loose ends left from ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", with the best special effects of the Trilogy, and maybe of all Sci-Fi movies. Personally, I love the fact that Darth Vader, my favorite character in motion picture history, turns good, and that his spirit(as Anakin)can be seen at the victory celebration alonside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda. The ending is just perfect.

2202580,3,B00076SCPW,"If George Lucas only knew how a lot of us feel somewhat cheated. ""Return Of The Jedi"" is quite good, but it really has a lot of mistakes on board, and is the weakest of his original trilogy. The idea of having another Death Star isn't so bad. I almost wanted to comment that they couldn't come up with a more original plan, but why not? Besides, that's the Empire's fortay. Building intimidation to rule the galaxy. A tasty first five minutes has an Imperial Shuttle escorted by two TIE's to a looming Death Star under construction. After it docks, a very shiny and even more frightening looking Vader dismebarks the shuttle to criticise an officer about the 'lack of progress' in the new station's construction. Meanwhile, Threepio and R2 find themselves in the palace of the jumbo sized slimy croissant Jabba The Hutt. He is really neat to watch, and is one of my favourite villans. A real scumbag. In his palace he has a slew of renegades, bounty hunters (yes, Fett is there), and Han Solo in carbonite placked on his wall. The two Alliance droids are put to work, as both Leia and Luke fail to rescue everyone else. The whole gang, including the now awake Solo, are taken on Jabba's sail barges and skiffs to the Sarlaac Pit, where a sudden heroic plight gets under way. Good action. Not new to the trilogy, but hardly seen until now, is Emperor Palpatine, who sounds like he just celebrated his 150th birhtday, and looks like a prune. Vader and master discuss the near success of the Imperial forces as they prepare to once again shake fear into all of the star systems with their new battle station.
As the film goes on, Solo, Leia, Luke, and the rest of the gang lead a group of commandos onto the forest moon of Endor and attempt to knock out the shield generator which is protecting the Death Star. Here is where the movie trips and falls flat on it's face. The Ewoks, who are native little bear-like creatures, encounter the squad in an awkward way, yet eventually help them in knocking out the Impereials who occupy the forest with their generator station. The Ewoks are cute, and they do make it fun to watch, but they are not needed for more than a few minutes. Too much yub-yub! Where's the space for Leia, or Solo to whoop the stupid stormtroopers and officers?  Some good fun comes with Chewie and two ewoks in a stolen AT-ST, blasting other walkers to smithereens. The other walkers probably were wondering why they're getting backstabbed by their own walker. This is a piece of the movie that is really funny!
Lando, the Rebel fleet and really nifty aquatic beings of Mon Calamari (not squid looking, but it's a name) lead an attack on the Death Star with a large sum of cruisers and fighters. All hell breaks loose when the fleet becomes trapped between a surprise attack from the Imperial fleet, and the Death Star itself. Watching this scene makes my heart pound with excitement, although the space battle gets messy with some mistakes (groan, again). Still, the three battles go on, and all the new vehicles are really neat to watch. I'd love a speeder bike for Christmas, but at the speed they go, ah, maybe not. Mark Hamill's Skywalker is stronger and more confident as he begins his realization of becoming a Jedi. The confrontaion with his black armoured father is tense, but not deep enough. Their lightsabers become too important between the two. However, one could only wish that Skywalker and Vader had a much more intense saber fight, with better skill, and more graceful moves. Clumsy and so stop and go, it didn't really faze me much.
The wonderful special effects (espscially the space battle) never lets you down, except for a moment here and there. A bigger shame was not enough characters relations, especially a sudden fact that Han and Lando are friends again-where was the full pledged reconciliation? Behind closed doors? Luke, on the other hand, gets 'all' of the emotional and chacracter attention. Figures. Carry a lightsaber, you get all the attention. I get it. The filmmakers almost gave everybody, lead or minior characters, ""jobs"", and just send them to work, including the very underused ace Wedge, his fellow pilots, Imeperial officers, and the Rebel commandos who you next to never see in the fight once it starts. Making Solo, Chewie, the Princess and Lando come aboard mostly for the ride was especially unfair. Knowing what kind of interest we had in the other two films with these characters, why not give them more in their final act? Everybody could have been given more broad outlooks and actions, instead of just running around with a blaster, or flying around in the Falcon. This confrontaion could end the Emipre's overall reign once and for all, yet the emotional impact for the Rebels should have been much bigger. They could have really emphasized on the possibility for peace throughout the galaxy, and the fear of their whole plan failing. Not to blame the cast, who are simply doing their part. It was that darn Lucas and his writers, selling us Ewoks instead of a greater need for character involvement. This thinned out adventure film was sadly, the last of the series-not saying it isn't worthy-no! ""Return Of The Jedi"" is much better than both ""The Phantom Menace"", and ""Attack Of The bowling pins, uh, clowns-Clones""! I do have to say that it should have been a lot deeper with a lot more invovlement, since it was the conclusion of the whole story. It's an overall ""fair"" space epic, but just barely making the worthy podium. Oh, and uh, don't feed the Ewoks, or else they might follow your squad home. Leia did it.",1065916800,,5589,4.6856561546286875
2202581,5,B00076SCPW,"'Stars Wars: Return of the Jedi, Episode VI' is one of the best of all the episodes of the trilogy ('Star Wars: A New Hope, Episode IV' and 'The Empire Strikes Back, Episode V'). Besides all the excitement and energy, special effect galore-you find out the secrets behind the mysterious legacy of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The romance between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia is subtle without all the sex appeal. The confrontation between Luke and his father, Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker) and the final battle of the Rebellion vs. The Evil Empire is just some of great climatic moments, plus those cute teddy bear-like Ewoks (Do I sense Lucas merchandising here?).  When I attended the first prequel I was disappointed over the story plot. The only thing that made it hold together was the special effects. So I'll stick with the original trilogy. At least it has Han Solo and Chewbacca. A perfect additional to the video is the great Soundtrack by John Williams. I miss the jivey song-and-dance number to the Jabba the Hut lair scenes. An original 1983 version of the Soundtrack album I recall that had the track from the film. It was titled ""Lapti Nek."" But I did find it on a reissue of 'Stars Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack (Box Set)' with all the original tracks including the Cantina Band and the Ewok celebration songs. I'd also like to mention that there is more humor in the original films than the prequels. It has the best overall story plot.

The prequels are just overpriced productions with a very weak story and dialogue. I'm not sure in the case of Lucas further venture into creating the origins of Obi-Wan Kenobi (One seems to appreciate the much older, wiser and the good side of ""the force"" Jedi Knight as played by late actor, Alec Guinness), how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader and the parents of the future Luke and Leia. Lately, Lucas seems to be trying to appeal to a broader audience other than focusing on a great story. Nothing can beat the original trilogy story by a stretch. I had alot of great memories about Stars Wars when it first started in 1977. It's become a American culture phenomenon commerically. It's something that everyone will remember and hand down their character, music and book collections to their kids. Yes, I'll say it I saw each one more than 10 times. Shame on me :)! The first book to come out after the first 'Star Wars: A New Hope' movie was Alan Dean Foster's Star Wars Novel ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye."" It's about the further adventures of Luke & Leia. There has even been spoofs in hiliarious tribute to this like 'Hardware Wars' and 'George Lucas in Love.' This is one of my top 5 desert island films. It's just one movie that will never grow old. It's just as entertaining as it was before. ""The Force"" is definitely with this for it to be one of the top 100 movies of all time named by the American Film Institute (AFI). That says alot.

I will never forget the first review for this movie by siskel and Ebert. Siskel was raving on and on like a kids who's dreams had all just come through. This was the local broadcast on WGN, not the national one and Ebert was unenthusiastic. Ebert eventually came around and that little'ol movie that Siskel when nuts over became the greatest movie yet made... Star Wars. Then it was renamed Star wars, New Hope.
I gave all of the first three trilogies 5 stars, because I just can't separate them as my favorite. There would be no ESB if there wasn't a SWNP. There would have been no ROJ without ESB.

2202584,5,B00076SCPW,"Out of 4,5,and 6 Return of the Jedi is without a doubt the best. Great charecters, awesome action sequences and great vilians make this movie what it is, GREAT!
  I should start with the great vilians like Darth Vader, Jabba the Hutt, Darth Sidius and Boba Fett. Let's start with Darth Vader. He's more evil than ever trying to kill his own son. Jabba is great. He's the leader of the Hutt crime family who has his own palace on Tatooine who's right hand man is the bounty hunter Boba Fett. Now Boba Fett, the fearless bounty hunter who will hunt down anyone if the pay is right. Finally Darth Sidius, AKA the Emperor is the leader of the Dark Side and has the power to take over anyones mind, yes even some weak

2202585,5,B00076SCPW,"To me the Star Wars series isn't just a set of films it's truly a modern myth and as such I think it (especially Return of the Jedi) gets some unfair criticisms.  Why does a band of Ewoks take down the Emperor's best troops?  Because the Ewoks aren't Ewoks they're the common person and nature itself fighting against an evil and unhealthy adversary.  So in an epic story that should be looked at for its art and greater message (I beleive) the little guy can triumph.  Why does one crashing starfighter take down the Super Star Destroyer when all it should have done was killed the command crew?  Because that was the emotional message of sacrifice.  The empire's troops aren't a self sacrificing bunch but the rebels are.  Why is this film lighter in tone than ESB?  Empire's placement in the mythic hero cycle puts it at the long dark night of the soul, the final portion of the cycle is the return.  Why does the great and powerful Darth Vader turn at the last moment?  That's the message about the power of love and salvation, what would the point of the first two films be if he didn't turn in the end?  Why is there less wisecracking with Han and Leia?  Because when Han gets dropped in the carbonite their relationship evolves into something more serious.
As to the special Edition, I liked most of the changes.  The musical number at Jabba's Palace was over the top but that was the way it was always supposed to be.  It also gave a little more light on Jabba's frustration with women.  I loved the Ewok victory ballad from the original version and was sad to see it go but the scenes showing the galaxy liberated were very moving.",1050364800,,1640,4.456375838926174

The battle wages them into the Forest moon of Endor. There, they meet the Ewoks. Fun, cute, and annoying. A bit too yub-yub.
The Empereor is hilarious and so bitterly evil. Always overconfident. Darth Vader never looked more dark and frightening. The spacebattle is very actionpacked, and exciting, yet flawed a few times-watch for the silly mistakes.

2202588,5,B00076SCPW,"Now this is film making at it's finest. This is more light-hearted than Empire, but it is still full of excitement and one of the greatest finales of all time. The high-energy, special-effects-laden conclusion to George Lucas's ambitious Star Wars trilogy delivers the final confrontation between Luke Skywalker (a more confident and mature Mark Hamill) and his nemesis-father, Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones), as the rebel alliance makes its last stand against the evil Empire. The film opens with an impressive set piece in the cave of the monstrous Jabba the Hut, who holds both Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) for his decadent pleasure until Skywalker comes to the rescue. The final battle pits an enormous armada of rebel ships against the rebuilt Death Star, the planet-killing weapon of the first film, while guerrilla forces battle Empire soldiers on the planet below with the help of a cuddly army of pint-sized, teddy-bear-like creatures known as Ewoks (Lucas's one concession to merchandising) and Skywalker confronts Vader and the emperor on the Deathstar. This is a must see!!! Director Richard Marquand invests the tale with plenty of humor and a vigorous sense of adventure without losing the seriousness of Skywalker's mission. Believe me C3PO is hysterical (as always) in this one. This is probably the funniest of the Star Wars movies! See this today.

2202589,3,B00076SCPW,"Star Wars - Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, is an improvement on its insipid predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back.  This is largely because it makes greater use of exciting and suspenseful action sequences, and has less of the verbosity that bogged down The Empire Strikes Back.
Luke Skywalker is now a fully trained Jedi Knight and, in a stretching of credibility, has transformed from a petulant youth into a master of Zen-like tranquility.  However, he is soon thrust back into the action when he is called on to rescue his friends from the clutches of the infamous mercenary, Jabba the Hutt.  Luke manages to outwit and kill Jabba's resident monster, but is not in time to save Carrie Fisher from being forced to don revealing underwear and chains.  Yes, really.  After narrowly avoiding death-by-Sarlacc (in whose belly one would ""find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years"") the group of friends race off to engage in warfare with their ultimate enemy - the Emperor - and his deputy Darth Vader.
In the event though, Luke's most difficult battle is with himself, because as Vader tells him, ad infinitum, it is impossible to resist the power of the Dark Side.  Meanwhile Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, C3PO, R2D2 and assorted others are attempting to destroy the impressive and aptly named Death Star before the Imperial forces crush the Rebel Alliance.  In the end, the viewer will be caught up in the euphoria of the  enthusiastic celebration party thrown by the rebels and the cute 'n' fuzzy ewoks, but they may also find themselves with a sneaking suspicion of relief that the epic saga is finally finished.",1040342400,,1672,4.842105263157895
2202590,3,B00076SCPW,"As a SW fan, I have to voice my feelings on this one, first off, I loved the other four films, TPM, AOTC, ANH, & TESB!, but ROTJ is by far my least favorite, after many years & Lucas' added shots, I still find it difficult to like this one, although all the right elements are in place, it still falls short, In 1983 when Lucas was overseeing the ""Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom"" he was quoted as saying that he wanted to distance himself from SW, & it seems he might have felt that way while finishing ROTJ in 1982, to begin with we see Darth Vader in a humbled state, whereas in TESB, he was a powerful intimidating force & very much in control, the rescue of Han Solo in my view was not as convincing, but o.k., but the showdown at the end is where this one seems to miss its mark, In the beginning we are introduced to a new incomplete Death Star under construction replacing the doomed one in ANH, In AOTC we see the plans for the one in ANH under way, which is more believable in terms that you can believe that it might take 20 years to construct which is the time frame between AOTC & ANH, but ROTJ is 4 years after ANH, which in some way makes it seem unreal in its approach, the only thing that saves this one is Mark Hamill's portrayal of a more mature Luke, it is clear that Hamill understands the character of Luke & his determination to turn Vader(his father)back to the good side & his confrontation with Emperor Palpatine & his determination to convert Luke, the fierce showdown between the 3 is what saves this one from being totally bad, Luke & Vader's tender moment at the end is emotional at best, even Lucas' insertion of Courasaunt celebrating the Empire's downfall is good at best, Irvin Kershner who directed TESB turned down the oppurtunity to do this one, but now says he wish he would have done it, I don't hate this one, I just feel it should have been done differently, with Courasaunt being the center of not only Luke's showdown with Vader & Emperor Palpatine, but the Rebels taking back Courasaunt since the Prequels tell us it will become an Imperial city, maybe Lucas did not have the technology in 1982 to make his vision of Courasaunt come to life, but with the film ""Blade Runner"" out a year before with the same kind of vision, it is hard to believe, however this one is o.k. for being the last one to bring closure to SW, but not the best!!!",1038009600,,2384,4.288248337028825

This presents the greatest struggle between good and evil.  When you see Vader and Luke having a light saber duel one last time, how could you not love it???  I also love the emperor as he brings such a evil presecense trying to lure Luke towards the dark side of the force.  Also the battle on Endor is magnificent.  Also whoever has a problem with the Ewoks is a moron.  Their is nothing wrong with them I think they are nice and bring some charm, how could you not smile when seeing Chewy interact with them.  Call me a sucker for happy endings but I love the way the movie ends so perfectly, if you are a fan of the saga, (yes that means you have to like the prequels) than you gotta love this movie.

Anyway, on to the review.  I don't know why people always say that this is a mediocre movie.  I loved it.  The action is as good as ever, and the lightsaber duel aboard the Second Death Star was the best of all, until Yoda squared off against Count Dooku.  The air battle was also great, and the ground battle wasn't bad either, but I'm still not sure whether the Ewoks were a curse or a blessing.

Part 6, Return of the Jedi, neatly deals with all of these issues while using amazing special effects and fantastic characters.  Jabba the Hutt reaches a new low for ugly, villanous creatures, and the Ewoks are cute, teddy-bear like creatures who use their low-tech fighting techniques to aide in the rebels' last attack on the Empire.

Of course the film is packed with the usual action, as well as the humor that made the first three films so charming and which is sometimes lacking in the more recent efforts. This one has a big job to perform, tying up all the strands of plot and giving us the climactic confrontation between Luke Skywalker and the forces of the dark side. It succeeds well - there is some real drama and emotion to these scenes, exceeding that of the usual science fiction fare. (Maybe it's a bit corny, but it works.) I am also very fond of the early scenes of the movie, which take place at the lair of Jabba the Hutt, a fat blob who runs a den of sin that is hugely amusing. Some fans may grow tired of the cutesy Ewoks later in the film, little teddy bear things that probably rank just above Jar Jar Binks in the saga's popularity. However, the Ewoks are crucial to the plot - indeed, without them, the rebel mission would be a failure. Their simple-hearted efforts are able to overcome the sinister advanced technologies that are pitted against them, and this message is actually rather inspiring. Overall this is a very entertaining film, and a memorable one.",1026950400,,1253,4.405172413793103

 My only problem with this film was too much was spent with Jabba. I would rather have seen more of the Death Star in action.

2202599,4,B00076SCPW,"Alright, I'll tell you straight out that this is not my favorite Star Wars movie.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the ultimate trilogy installment with the best acting and storyline by far.  But, because this is Star Wars and it is meant to be seen together, I've got to give it four stars.
  The story is fairly simple, picking up several months to a year or so after ""ESB"".  Leia, Luke, Lando, Chewie, and the droids go undercover to Jabba's palace in an attempt to rescue Han Solo from being Hutt's favorite mantlepiece decoration.  It's pretty funny with a decent bit of action involved including Jabba getting choked (haha).
  Luke heads off to Degobah to see his Jedi master-buddy, Yoda while the others ship back to base to find out about the second Death Star.  When Luke returns, Han Solo leads a team to the forest moon of Endor to shut down the deflector shield which will leave the space station defenseless, allowing Lando and his fighters the room to destroy it... with Emperor Palpatine aboard.
  I won't give away the ending, but the end includes the battle of the Ewoks, Luke's showdown with Darth Vadar and the Emperor, and some good, rather great, news for the Rebellion.
  Like I said before, I'm giving it four stars mainly because the other parts of the trilogy hold it together.  It's nearly all battle scenes (they get tedious after awhile) with those creepy Ewoks, much less passionate acting than ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and an ending which kind of just drops off.  It is a pretty decent movie, but not the best of the trilogy, is all.  I recommend it if you want to complete your viewing of the story, but be prepared for a disappointment if you watched ""The Empire Strikes Back"" prior.
  Final Word: Get it as part of the trilogy.  ""The Empire  Strikes Back"" contains the best acting, storyline, and special effects, so be sure to watch that one too.",1020556800,,1879,4.619335347432024

2202608,5,B00076SCPW,"Of all the ""Star Wars"" movies (prior to ""The Phantom Menace""),
""Return of the Jedi"" is my personal favorite. I remember seeing the movie in the theaters when it first came out. Watching it on my tv screen may not have that same effect that it had in the theaters I thoroughly love watching it nevertheless. I never tire of watching the two and a half hour epic.
What I love about ""The Return of the Jedi"" is the emotional resonance between Luke Skywalker and his father Anakin Skywalker or Darth Vader. After his brief conversation with Luke after he had turned himself in, the conflict between good and evil that was occuring in Darth Vader's soul was pretty evident despite the mask that he was wearing. Of course Darth Vader wasn't going to admit that to Luke at the time. The fight scene between Darth and Luke was spectacular. Luke was tormented and had no choice to defend himself. Of course the final scene when Darth had Luke unmask him was heartbreaking as well as when Luke cremated his father's body. The other heartbreaking scene was watching Yoda pass away and Luke looking helplessly as he watched his Jedi master die.
One of my favorite scenes involved the interaction between Princess Leia and the Ewok Wicket. That was just hilarious. It took a moment for Leia to gain the suspicious Ewok's trust but she eventually did when she shot that soldier. I also enjoyed the scene when C-3PO was re-enacting their battles with the empire and hearing his voice impersonations of Darth Vader.
I don't know what it is that endears me to ""Return of the Jedi"" but this movie is simply a classic with me. The special effects maybe considered dated now but it's timeless to me. The storylines were poignant and entertaining. I can't say that about a lot of movies nowadays or even back when I was just a kid.",1002672000,,1810,4.589506172839506
2202609,5,B00076SCPW,Star Wars is great! Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Star Wars movies. I due think that it would be easy for the stormtroopers to beat the rebels at the moonbase though.,1000512000,,177,4.085714285714285
2202610,4,B00076SCPW,"Considered by many fans to be the best of the Star Wars films, ""Return of the Jedi"", the sixth chapter in the masterful space saga, concludes the unraveling story against oppression, as our band of freedom fighters, headed by Luke Skywalker, discover the construction of a second Death Star.  The final battle rages on, on the forest moon of Endor.  Joining forces with the stalwart Ewoks, the Rebel Alliance fights to bring down its defense mechanism, as an even bigger space battle takes place above.  In the meantime, in an effort to fulfill his destiny and become a fully-trained Jedi Knight, Luke goes off to do battle one more time against Darth Vader, as the Dark Side of the Force beckons him to a life-and-death duel.
""Jedi"" continues the tradition of groundbreaking special effects that outdo ""Hope"" and ""Empire"", and in many ways goes as far as to outdo a lot of the effects we see today.  While a few of the puppets used for the aliens are a bit on the stiff side, every element of the fantasy is still believable in the way the story is unvieled.  The epic Death Star battle looks simply amazing, even by today's standards, and the story is just as meaningful and as deep as its always been.  It's definitely a worthy conclusion, and sits up there with the greatest science fiction films of all time.
I consider ""Jedi"" the third best in the series, for several reasons, mainly because the acting seemed a bit routine.  The actors weren't as stiff as the actors who appeared in ""The Phantom Menace"", but by the time this film was made, they all seemed to be somewhat bored.  And in some strange way, the way the characters react this time around adds to the drama that pervades the movie, so it isn't always noticable; just a slight detraction from the excitement in ""Empire"".
The Special Edition of the film once again does nothing more than to add something fresh to an old classic, testing the limits of CGI special effects.  However, the enhancements that were made for this outing were actually worthwhile.  The dance number in Jabba's Palace is exceptionally well done, and has more of a meaning than it did originally.  The music is a bit more bluesy, and the animations of the alien dancers is fantastic.  The Sarlaac Pit is more threatening, now that ILM has added a beak that swallows those who fall into its vicious maw.  And finally, the ending of the movie has been given new music, and a polished ending, that culminates all the worlds explored in the trilogy, including a first look at the Imperial world of Coruscant, which was a big part of the story in ""The Phantom Menace"".
This film represents what the Star Wars universe is about.  It takes the fantasy and rises it to new heights, expanding on an already great storyline.  As far as sequels go, it's a classic, and it's sure to excite.  Definitely not to be missed!",998006400,,2849,4.6118811881188115

Just as The Empire Strikes Back took the Star Wars saga in a different direction, Return of the Jedi does the same. One should watch Return of the Jedi with an open mind and a desire to be entertained and moved, because isn't that really what seeing a Star Wars movie is about?

2202614,5,B00076SCPW,"Return Of The Jedi is the final installment in the amazing masterpiece trilogy: Star Wars, and is one of the best in the trilogy. It perfectly interweaves emotion, action, and romance in this epic masterpiece which finishes one of the greatest movie trilogies of all times.
  The Galactic Empire has begun construction on a new Death Star which is even more powerful than the first Death Star, and meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2D2, and C3PO are attempting to rescue Han Solo from the evil clutches of Jabba The Hutt. After they rescue Han, they plan for the destruction of the new Death Star and find out that the Emperor is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of the new Death Star. Han, Luke, Leia, 3PO, R2, and a group of rebel commandos must disable the Shield Generator on the orbiting moon of Endor to allow rebel fighter pilots to fly into the Death Star and destroy the main reactor. While the battle rages on, Luke must face his own destiny and confront Darth Vader in a battle to the death which may spell certain doom for the Rebel Alliance and their cause to restore freedom to the galaxy.
The entire movie shines with an epic look whether its a space battle, a sail barge assault above the jaws of a hungry Sarlacc, a Speeder Bike chase through the redwood forests of Endor, or a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The emotions involved between Luke Skywalker and the truth about his past grip the audience in the same way that Luke feels, and suspend them above the fate of the Rebel Alliance. Han and Leia's feelings for each other are more developed in this movie, and really tie up loose ends that were left from The Empire Strikes Back. The entire movie actually ties up loose ends and is kind of the resolution point for the Star Wars trilogy.  This movie is definitely the best in the trilogy, and worth buying.

The son confronts his father and manages to bring the Jedi back out of the dark side which is definitely destroyed. The Emperor, the dark half of human nature, tha dark evil of humanity, the dark forces of the universe is brought to his end by the father who is thus regenerated and finally can take off his mask to look at his son with his real eyes. During that time, the sister and Solo, the ex-mercenary, destroy the shield of the death star and make friends with some primitive people on the planet. Those are so funny and so cute that they are lovable at first sight, looking like big living teddy-bears. But deeper than those plain events, it is the victory of the bright side over the dark side of things, the victory of the alliance of all the little Davids against the tyranny of the big Goliath. It is the victory of a joyful and happy society of individuals who love each other and love music, dancing and celebrations over an austere and sinister tyranny. The only mystery that survives at the end of the film, once the body of the father is burnt as some kind of religious homage, is why the sister is called a Princess, which is a reference to a monarchy and which builds a parallel with the Emperor of the dark side. She should be anything but a Princess. She should have no link with any non-democratic political system, she should have no link with any political system at all.

2202616,3,B00076SCPW,"Personally, my favorite Star Wars movie is THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. When you compare the two, there are some MAJOR problems with this third installment. First off, the storyline is very repetitive. Go to Tatooine (again). Visit master Yoda (again). Fight the super-duper-Death Star (again). See a pattern? I will admit that the battle against the Death Star is really spectacular. But now for the MAJOR FLAWS. ONE-Darth Vader looses his hand and starts breathing is if he's dying. Oops, I guess someone accidentally put the life-support system for Darth in the hand. Oh well. Notice his labored breathing. TWO-The lightsaber battle between Darth and Luke is NOTHING compared to the lightsaber battle in EMPIRE. Darth Vader came across as menacing and evil and obviously in control in EMPIRE, but here, he fights back like a kid who has never held a lightsaber in his life. Instead of great choreography, the fight scene is reduced to Luke fighting Darth in a great burst of adrenaline, only moving forward. THREE-As a friend of mine pointed out, how stupid was the Empire to build a bigger Death Star, with a BIGGER weak point. What was the POINT of having all those shafts and tunnels leading from the outside to the vulnerable core? I guess Lucas couldn't think of any other way to destroy it. And notice how in Phantom Menace Anakin ACCIDENTALLY blows up a space station. Are all good guys this lucky? FOUR-Ugh! Ewoks. I want Star Wars, not a teddy-bear commercial. It's as if Lucas' Ewoks were sitting in his basement, collecting dust, so he said, ""well, I'll just bring them out and slap them into this movie so they won't feel so bad."" FIVE-What are two-legged AT-ST walkers doing in a congested, hilly FOREST? For all their technology, you'd have thought that the Empire had heard of WHEELS. No wonder the Ewoks could beat 'em.

2202617,5,B00076SCPW,"Return of the Jedi is the final chapter in the original Star Wars trilogy. Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, R2D2, and Threepio all return in this part of the Star Wars story. Even Lando plays a role. Luke faces Vader once more, while the rebel alliance prepares for and makes a final attack on the Empire to end its evil ways. The movie closes with triumphs for the rebels and of course our main charecters. Even though there is some saddness to Luke's part of the story, he accepts everything in the end.
  If it hadn't been for one of my closest friends, I would never have even watched 'Return of the Jedi'. And I'm glad that I did. The first Star Wars movie that I ever watched was 'A New Hope'. I found that one enjoyable, but it wasn't really my favorite movie. I was going to watch the others because the plot sounded interesting. Unfortunately, before I got to 'Empire', and 'Jedi', another one of my friends who is one of the big Star Wars fans out there dragged me off to see 'Phantom Menace' on opening night, and we can all understand what I mean when I say, ""ugh"". After that, the little desire I had to see 'Empire' and 'Jedi' somewhat diminished, until the same friend who'd shown me 'A New Hope' invited me to watch them with her. 'Empire' was wonderful, and then when I saw 'Return of the Jedi', Star Wars became one of my favorite movie saga's. The actors in this movie are all really suited to their roles, and they give the audience an understanding of their personalities (unlike 'Phantom Menace'). The charecters are all really neat with their backround stories, and past. The storyline itself is complex but interesting enough to keep you enjoying the movies. The effects are really neat, but not too artificial like in Episode I. The music is very catching and suiting to the movie as well. It adds another aspect to the story.

2202618,5,B00076SCPW,"Return of the Jedi is the most flawed of the original trilogy.  Some of the characters are not as well developed. (a Brain dead Han Solo for example)  The direction is not as good.  The ewoks was a bad idea from the beginning.  It is not as an original film as the previous two, recycling such ideas as the Death Star.
With the negatives out of the way, let me focus on the many positives.  It brings the star wars saga to an epic close.  At the heart of the star wars saga is the story between good and evil, father and son, student and teacher.  The scene between Luke and Yoda is touching, offering finality to their relationship in the empire strikes back.  The scenes between Vader and Luke in the Emperor's throne room are absolutely entrancing, leading up to the epic and touching conclusion that finalizes the story.  The epic space battle is by far the most grand scale and exciting space battle I have ever seen captured on film.
It is the end to the grandest space opera ever made on film, and it is a shame that the recent Phantom Menace did not even come close to the quality of the original classic trilogy. We can only hope that Episode 2 would reignite the flame.",984355200,,1179,4.34703196347032

It had been one of my favorite scenes, and i didn't think it was right that they completely reworked it instead of adding to it.

2202621,5,B00076SCPW,"The third installment in the spectacular Star wars Trilogy chronicles the further adventures of the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Return of the Jedi is a different adventure than The Empire Strikes Back, being more in the tradition of Saturday matinee serials in both story and tone than its dark (but nonetheless better) predecessor.
Luke returns Tatooine only to rescue his friends from the vile Jabba the Hutt. The Alliance finds that the Empire is constructing a new, more powerful Death Star protected by a an energy shield generated from the moon of Endor. The Alliance conjures up a daring plan to destroy the technological terror while Luke prepares to confont his nemesis-father Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine aboard the half-completed battle station.
Mark Hamill gives a charismatic performance as Luke Skywalker, being more in control and taking charge of the film. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are suprisingly bland compared to their performances in Empire in contrast to Luke. C-3PO and R2-D2 are once again delightful and the Ewoks are cute and all but are just too silly. Alan Hume's cinematography can't match his last work in Empire but still is well-done. The set designs again can't live up to the designs in Empire but still are eye-filling and ingenious. The set in Jabba's palace is good, but the interior designs of the Death Star are more imaginative and interesting, in my opinion they are the best in the film. The editing and especially the soundwork are excellent, while John Williams contributes a fine score. But here the first improvement over Empire is the truly dazzling special effects. Lucas rounded up the best effects supervisors, (Dennis Muren-9 Oscars, Richard Edlund-6 Oscars, Ken Ralston-5 Oscars, and Phil Tippet-2 Oscars) and they did a fantastic job, using over 15O models along with the even more stunning laser, lightning, and fire effects. The action sequences are the other improvement, boasting of 5 the most breathtaking scenes ever filmed. The space battle and Sarlaac pit fight are in my eyes the highlights, though the speeder bike chase and the lightsaber duel are nothing short of spectacular.
For the special edition, Lucas supervised the introduction of new footage along with remastering the sound and editing, and enhancing the cinematography and visuals with the newest state-of-the-art technologies. Overall, Return of the Jedi is an outstanding film with nice touches of warmth and humor. Though it can't measure up to the first  two films, it still excellent. And like the first two, its a dazzling adventure that will leave you breathless.",976320000,,2609,5.138823529411765
2202622,3,B00076SCPW,"I remember the first time I saw this movie.  Opening day in May of 1983, standing in a long line with extremely high hopes.  Everyone around was talking about the special effects or anticipated plot twists.
Me, I was looking forward to the dialogue.
Star Wars and Empire had impressed me greatly with sharp funny dialogue.  (Princess Leia to Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars:  ""I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.""  The terrific battle of wits betwenn Leia to Han Solo in both of those movies.)  This in combination with multiple screenings of George Lucas's other masterpeice, American Graffitti, convinced me that the filmmaker had a terrific ear for dialogue.
My concern started during the opening crawl where I encountered the phrase ""Little did Luke know...."" Those words sounded trite, cliched, overused. What was wrong with ""Unknown to Luke...""?
Then came C-3PO's opening dialogue on Tatooine with R2-D2.  It sounded too much like explanatory dialogue for the audience, rather stilted and forced.
But then, Princess Leia of the razor sharp wit was dragged before Jabba.  Here, at last, I thought we are going to get a great line of dialogue.  A smart, caustic comment to make Jabba the Hutt roar with rage.  What do I get?  ""We have powerful friends.""
I felt powerful disapointment.
The scene where they escape from Jabba's clutches was pretty cool (Okay, I admit it, it puts The Matrix's action choreography to shame.)  But the Luke goes to Dagobah and delivers his lines so badly it makes Sylvester Stallone look like Lawrence Olivier.
As they approach Endor dialogue began to improve somewhat.  Han's instruction to Chewbacca to ""fly casual"" is a high-point as far as dialogue goes.  But then the Ewoks come into the picture and made me gag with their exagerrated cutesyness.  The movie began to feel less like a Star Wars movie and more like the Star Wars Holiday Special.
But everyone around me seemed to be having a great time.  After the movie they declared it the best of the trilogy.  So I gave it a few more screenings to see if I could learn to love it.  Always with eager friends.
It didn't help.
More recently I had screenings of the entire trilogy with friends who had apparently never seen them before.  Their opinion matched mine.  Something happened with the third movie.
This is the only Star Wars movie improved by the Special Edition footage.  Yet even the decision to play down the Ewoks couldn't get Mark Hamill to emote or give Carrie Fisher better dialogue.
I invite all of those who dissed Episode One to watch it alongside  of Return of the Jedi.  They will probably be shocked to find that that movie is actually an improvemant.",975196800,,2683,4.772234273318872
2202623,5,B00076SCPW,"the star wars movies are just awesome. I like them better than any other film trilogy or franchise, they are all very entertaining and action-packed with interesting characters and effects that look more real than anything in, say, the phantom menace. I think both sequels to the original star wars are better. The story and dialogue is a little too hokey in that last movie, although it was a revolution in the way we look at movies. In the sequels the characters are more developed and we also explore more of the star wars universe. Although Empire clearly has the best story, Jedi might be the most entertaining and definitely the most satisfying in the series. Kids usually like this one the best, because it is very funny and has a very happy ending.",973728000,,756,4.649253731343284
2202624,4,B00076SCPW,"""Return of the Jedi"" is a flashy, glossy, fast paced, action packed by the numbers sequel which rehashes many of the ideas explored in the first two films and neglects to offer anything really fresh.  Having expressed that, ""Return of the Jedi"" rocks.  Filled with more action, alien characters, effects and laser blast exchanges than the first two films combined, ""Jedi"" entertainingly concludes the saga and answers all remaining questions posed in ""The Empire Strikes Back"".
Perhaps the biggest flaw of ""Jedi"" is the lack of originality.  After the inventive and exciting first twenty minutes where Luke Skywalker and his friends attempt to rescue Han Solo, the film's plot resorts to an ""mission plot"" where the Star Wars characters attempt to destroy another Death Star built by the evil Empire.  If this film were not a Star Wars film the story would not be as successful.  But, because of the cameraderie between the characters and the affection we have for them the film comes off as more entertaining and successful than it should be.  Watching ""Jedi"" is like watching friends you love doing what they're good at doing, saving the universe.
Highlights include a last ditch- no holds barred battle between the Empire and the Rebellion, and the final confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader which could possibly represent the greatest fight in movie history.  Not because of the swordplay, ""Phantom Menace""'s Duel of the Fates fight is far more flashy.  But the scene succeeds because of the saga, the characters involved and the importance of their confrontation.  And the aftermath of that final confrontation results the trilogy's most poignant moment.
""Return of the Jedi"" is not the best ""Star Wars"" film, in fact it may be the weakest.  However, the film provides an entertaining and affectionate conclusion to the greatest film saga ever.",970963200,,1855,5.072368421052632

Afterwards, the Rebels find out that the Emperor has built a new Death Star  over Endor.  They go to destroy it, leading to the best overal climax of  the trilogy.  Why do so many people hate it? 1. Ewoks,  little Teddy bear  aliens who help the rebels defeat the Empire.  2. Some feel the Empire was  far too easily beaten. 3. Boba Fett dies.  O.K. I admit it, the Ewoks were  childish but Lucas probably wanted something in the Trilogy to interest  kids, right?  The Empire was beaten easily, but if critics want it to have  not been so easy, there Return of the Jedi would have to be at least a 3  hour movie or there would havet to be another movie following it.  And Boba  Fett did not die.  He flew out of the Sarlacc's mouth later.  Give Lucas a  break, he came up with two profecionally done movies with fantastic plots.  Sure, Return of the jedi is a little weaker but, after a while you dont'  ahve as good ideas for ONE series as you did before.  There is only so much  you can do with a conclusion, and there are certain limits for a movie.  I  think critics need to stop trying to fit movies into their own little  perfection box, and just enjoy this fun movie.  No one can deny that the  enire trilogy is a fantastic experience.

2202626,5,B00076SCPW,"Of the original Star Wars trilogy, this one is the best.  It's not often you see sequals that are as good as episodes V and VI.  The special  effects, no doubt, are wonderful and the action scenes, including the  battle at the sarlac pit, speeder bikes, battle on endor, battle at the  death star, and Luke and Vader's showdown, are incredibly awesome, even for  today's movie standards.  The storyline may not be as sharp as the previous  2, but it is still an excellent ending.  One thing I didn't like, was Bobba  Fett's death.  One, it was kinda stupid.  Two, I didn't want to really see  him die, at least not yet.  Would have loved to see a lot more of his  character.  But other than that, the movie is one of the most exciting of  all time.  A must have for anyone.",967334400,,773,4.286713286713287
2202627,5,B00076SCPW,"For those of you who haven't seen Return of the Jedi, it is about Luke Skywalker completing the final steps of becoming a Jedi knight. It will  then be up to him to train new Jedi. If you haven't seen Episode's IV and  V, A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, then I would not reccomend  viewing this film. However, if you have seen those two, this film is highly  reccomended.
For those of you who have seen it: Everyone always complains  about this movie being so awful, but I think it is the best in the trilogy.  I know saying this isn't going to win me any friend's, but the point is, it  is a really good, but under rated film. Sure there were things that should  have been done differently, but not that many of them. Only 3 to my count.  1. Bobba Fett should not have died in such a stupid way. 2. The Ewoks  shouldn't have beaten the Empire. They should have led the Empire to their  city, where all of the Ewoks get killed and their city destroyed BUT paving  the way for the rebel's to take out the shield generator. 3. After the  Death Star was destroyed, the rebel fleet should have had to contend with  the fleet of Star Destroyers.
So really only 2 things should have been  changed, and the movie should have been longer with a battle between the  Rebel Fleet and the Star Destroyers. So why does everyone like to bash this  film? When I saw the Special Edition in the theatre, durring one of the  best parts in any movie, when Darth Vader destroyed the Emporor, the crowd  cheered. The movie must be doing something right to get a reaction like  that, so why is it always the most critisized? Sure the Ewoks were dumb,  but other than that, it was great!

I love the scenes on Tatooine and in Jabba's palace, especially  Luke's fight with the Rancor and the battle at the Sarlac pit! From then on  it  gets a little boring until the rebels land on Endor and Vader and the  Emperor capture Luke and try to turn him. I almost have to laugh at the way  Luke and the emperor go back and forth with mean little remarks. Out of all  the parts in the movie, I like to watch Luke and Vader fight it out and  then how Vader is redeemed. I'm sure everyone is sober when Luke sets his  father's funeral pyre on fire, but then they all will smile at the end when  he sees Ben, Yoda, Anakin together. I will admit the battle with the Ewoks  was kinda weak at points, but they did think up some crude ideas to destroy  the walkers. I love this film and will probably watch it endless times.

2202630,2,B00076SCPW,"If you watch this at face value applying no other thought about anything except what is going on in this movie right before your eyes at a single moment in time you will be questionless. If you try to relate previous  happenings with those that occured later on than in many instances you will  be dumbfounded. In ""Return of the Jedi"" what bothers me is the  battle sequences with the Ewoks.(Not the Ewoks themselves so much) I  remember Emperor Palpatine specifically telling Luke Skywalker that an  entire legion of his best troops were waiting for his rebel friends. During  the battle sequence with Ewoks you really don't get a sense that a legion  of imperial troops consists of any more than a few storm troopers and some  Imperial Walkers. Wouldn't a legion of troops consist of more than a few  hapless troops?(I'm not even going to get into the fact that in Episode IV:  A New Hope Obi Wan made references to the storm troopers being able to  shoot at very precise blast points. What happened to them since? Were they  drinking? They couldn't hit the broad side of a barn the way they were  shooting? Weren't those Walkers a bit on the flimsy side? Was that a log I  saw just smash it to bits? World War II tanks were more menacing than those  ""futuristic"" Walkers.) ""Return Of The Jedi"" falls  victim to the cliche of the evil doers instead of pulverizing the enemy  they play with them. I couldn't believe the emperor would command a fleet  of star destroyers to wait while a strike team was attempting to take out  the deflector shield and a small rebel fleet was ready to begin their  attack run on ""The Death Star"". Don't they have memories? Did  they hear about what happened to the first ""Death Star""? Wouldn't  they be a bit more on edge? How about more defensive? Can the empire want  to strike back twice in a row? Apparently not when the movie is called  ""Return Of The Jedi"". This movie is certainly watchable and even  enjoyable but a good dose of thought with a little bit of memory(on your  part) reveals more than a little absurdity.",962841600,,2058,4.524456521739131
2202631,2,B00076SCPW,"Return Of The Jedi, the third and final installment in the classic Star Wars trilogy, is a far cry from the epic grandeur of A New Hope and the elegant darkness of The Empire Strikes Back. And that is so frustrating  because this film should have been the best and most spectacular Star Wars  film of them all. And while the film comes through visually (of course), we  get stuck with two hours of shamless self-parody. From the opening sequence  in which Jabba The Huts palace becomes little more than something out of a  muppet movie, and the rather disappointing death of the feared bounty  hunter Boba Fett, to the outrageous depiction of a tribe of primitive Teddy  bears defeating the Emperors finest troops (a sequence that includes  Chewbacca bellowing out Tarzans famous jungle cry), Return Of The Jedi  falls flat. Indeed, who could forget the quik and wimpy way in which the  mighty Emperor is destroyed by his apprentice, Darth Vader, who, despite  his fanatical commitment in the first two films, 'converts' to the 'good  side' in just seconds (yeah, right). Yep, long gone is the sence that the  Empire is truly the molevolent and powerful force it was in A New Hope  (they destoyed an entire planet) and The Empire Strikes Back (the rebels  could not run fast enough).

2202633,5,B00076SCPW,"I was 8 years old when I saw Episode IV in '77, and I probably did not understand the concept of sequels at that time. EMPIRE is still my favorite of the entire saga(although Phantom Menace is growing on me and might  surpass that fave).Return is an exciting film with effects that almost  dwarf the effects of the original.  The best scenes, I thought, were  the ones involving the assault on the Death Star II. My only complaint is  that Lucas, for some reason, did not develop these scenes as I had  hoped. Everytime I ooooohed and aawwwhed at the awesome effects during the  space battle involving this assault the film cut to the battle on Endor and  then cut to the light saber duel. I think that if there is a failing to  this film it is that there is too much happening at once, which is  understandable since this is the last one of the series and Lucas would not  dare make a Star Wars film that is 3 hours.  The Special Edition  improves on a few things in ""JEDI"". For one thing, it is nice  that Lucas saw fit to do away with that ridiculous Ewok song in the  celebration scene of the original film. It has been replaced with music by  John Williams that is more effective for the finale. The Special Edition  also introduces us to Coruscant, which we will become familiar with in  Phantom Menace and episodes to come later.

A great movie with a positive message:when you're caught  between good and evil, allways choose the GOOD side because you'll come out  victorious in the end.

Yes, the Empire was not depicted well in this film  despite the fact they were much better equipped and better prepared then  the rebels.  I can't buy the fact that the stormtroopers on Endor simply  gave up; I mean come on; and what about the imperial fleet?  Wouldn't they  have fought to the finish even if the Death Star was destroyed?  Also I  agree that at least one good guy had to die.  In the expanded universe I  keep hoping that they will. How many times can Luke Leia and Han get into  trouble and still come out alive?  I thinbk that Luke should have died on  the Death Star holding his father; it would have been a more realistic  ending; Yes I guess that good has to prevail over evil but the lack of  sacrifices on the part of the rebels was too hard to swallow.  I really  didn't mind the Ewoks as much; Lucas's point there was that you can still  win no matter if your a pint size runt.  ""It was for the kids after  all.""  The best part of the film of course is the drama which takes  place in the Death Star's throne room between the Emperor, Vader, and Luke.  At any rate overall this film was good and its Star Wars!

2202646,2,B00076SCPW,"I've already reviewed this once, but after TPM came out, I watched it again and saw I was very foolish to give it as high a rating as I had previously attached to it. The Empire in this movie seems schizophrenic  from the other two. The conclusion of A New Hope actually presented the  Empire as a menace with all but three Rebel fighters wiped out and the  Yavin moon nearly destroyed. In Empire Strikes Back, the Empire annihilated  the Rebels on Hoth so badly the Rebels had to flee the galaxy. Here, the  Rebels' losses are incredibly small. From what I saw, only two heavier  craft were destroyed while I don't recall a single Star Destroyer  surviving--even the Super Star Destroyer--which was, unrealistically, wiped  out by a ship 1/10000 its size. In ANH, a legion of stormtroopers wiped out  the Rebels on Princess Leia's ship, yet in ROTJ, they couldn't kill more  than two Ewoks (?!). No one can accuse Lucas of being a slave to logic at  least. That's not such a good thing, I think. In the previous movies, Leia  is portrayed as strong-willed, yet in this--with the lone exception of her  strangling of Jabba the Hutt--she is always dependent on the others,  especially Solo, for direction. There's no sense the Rebels have actually  accomplished anything in this. No major characters on the Rebels' side die.  Lando was originally scripted to die, but Lucas cut that because a test  audience didn't like it. Ford begged for Solo to die, but all-knowing Lucas  autocratically refused the venerable actor his request. What made the first  two movies so magical was the sense that there was an actual menace to the  Rebellion. The Empire killed off Kenobi and slaughtered billions on  Alderaan in ANH. In TESB, the the Imperials drove the Rebels from Hoth,  seized Cloud City, imprisoned Solo in a living hell of carbon freeze, and  severed Luke's arm. There is no corresponding sense of loss here. The Force  is underutilized except to make Luke an Olympian high jumper, and Vader  suddenly--implausibly--sees the error of his ways and redeems himself. I  much doubt a man who's spent six years trying to convert or kill his own  son is all of a sudden going to decide he was wrong. Also, why does Anakin  get the good side of the afterlife? He gets his hair back and appears at  least partially rejuvenated whereas Yoda still looks like a reject from a  gargoyle factory. There's an almost comical air about the movie as if the  makers understand they've just devalued the premises of the entire rest of  the series and really don't care. Only Leia is wounded of all the heroes  and that only a flesh wound. Lucas seems to have fallen--as he did somewhat  less gallingly in the first movie--into the cliche of bad guys who never  hit and good guys who never miss. With the exception of Piett (a holdover  from TESB), the Imperial officers don't exude the aura of menace as did  Tarkin and Motti and Veers in the previous films. The Star Destroyers so  deadly int he first two are basically lumbering targets for Rebel lasers  and occasional kamikazes. (Did anyone else wonder why a Tie Fighter  slamming into a Star Destroyer couldn't bring the ship down but a Rebel  fighter hitting THE Star Destroyer could?) I only saw two Rebel fighters go  down, but I saw about eighty trillion Tie Fighters being destroyed, whereas  in the first film, casualties were much more balanced. If the main reactor  core was so important, why didn't the Empire just devise blast doors to  close over the shaft and seal it from damage once the Rebels entered the  superstructure? And why Ewoks? JarJar Binks looks as sophisticated as Vader  compared to these billions of midgets who seem immune to Imperial weapons  fire. The elaborate space battle--which visually breathtaking--is basically  your routine good-guys-squash-bad-guys-who-have  superior-weaponry-but-dont-know-how-to-use-it occurrence. Lucas has fallen  into the David Eddings-Gene Roddenberry cycle that Good never can lose  because Evil is so inept even when all evidence indicates Evil is the more  powerful entity. The logical gaps in the movie are huge, and the ending  cliched, mundane, and ridiculous. At least the Republic has to lose at the  end of the first trilogy. Only a child could truly love this movie or think  it was better then either ANH or TESB.",934416000,,4325,4.8493150684931505
2202647,3,B00076SCPW,"Return of The Jedi embodies the strengths and weaknesses of the Star Wars continuity.  The visuals and the imagination put into creating a fascinating universe remain splendid.  The SFX are often priceless, such as  the scene where the Rebel fleet amasses for the fateful warp to attack the  new Death Star; the sudden appearence of the Imperial Fleet; the opening  attack of some one million TIE fighters of all conceivable classes (this  shot alone is worth the price of the film); the kamikaze attack by a  crippled Rebel fighter (likely inspired by a similar attack by a Cylon  fighter into the Batlestar Galactica's landing bay) straight through the  bridge of the Empire's command Star Destroyer, sending it plunging to its  death into the Death Star.  The sheer visual brilliance of the SFX is too  great to really quantify.
And yet they also embody the film's grave  weaknesses.  The film's primary action set piece involves a Rebel special  forces raid on a forcefield generator protecting the Death Star.  The place  is guarded by a legion of the Empire's best troops, yet they are utterly  humiliated by Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and some one million nauseating  little creatures called Ewoks.  George Lucas has often stated that this  battle's influence was from Vietnam combat, where supposedly lightly armed  guerrillas defeated the high tech US Army.  It shows Lucas' complete  ignorance of Vietnam (the ""lightly armed"" Communists were in fact  very heavily armed and suffered losses out of all proportion to their  numbers) and also insults the intelligence of the viewer; Locas got it  right in The Empire Strikes Back with the defeat of the Rebels at Hoth, so  why couldn't he show the Rebels suffering very high losses against the  Empire here?  It's the cliche from time immemorial of the bad guys who  can't shoot straight; Lucas should have known better.
Also hurting the  film is the rather idiotic battle of Jabba The Hutt, an obscenity of a  creature who is the crime lord of Tatooine.  The battle on Jabba's sail  barge is too implausibly insane to be really entertaining, though it does  have some good moments.
Only the excellent cat-and-mouse between Luke  Skywalker, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine saves the film in terms of  human interaction.  The shots of Vader losing a hand to Luke, and then  seeing his son electrocuted by Palpatine are gut-wrenching.

8045154,5,B00076SCPW,"So Return Of The Jedi is set a few months after the events of the last movie. The Empire has constructed a new Death Star much more powerful than the first, Luke has finished his Jedi training, and Han Solo is still trapped in carbonite. So first things first, Luke has to go rescue his friend from the clutches of the grotesque Jabba The Hutt on his home planet Tatooine. Now a few things to cover before we carry on with the story, now in past movies we keep hearing about this Jabba The Hutt and that he's bad news, but they don't really tell you what he looks like so you're mind is thinking of all kinds of things of how he looks and he's pretty gross basically a giant slug. Just, eck! Second, Luke Skywalker is a Jedi now. He is so different from when we saw him in The Empire Strikes Back, he's no longer whining about his training, he has complete faith in himself and his abilities, and he has mastered the Force because before he like really had to concentrate to use the Force, now it's instantaneous! Oh, and he's got a brand new cool lightsaber! So back to the story, they save Han and Luke debarks back to the Dagobah system one last time to finish his training. And sadly, master Yoda is dying of old age and reveals to Luke several things, he has to confront Vader to truly become a Jedi, after Yoda dies Luke is the only Jedi left in the galaxy, and there is another member of the Skywalker family. And yes, I do get misty-eyed when Yoda dies, it's depressing. Meanwhile on the second Death Star, The Emperor himself, Darth Vader's master arrives to corrupt young Skywalker to the dark side. And The Emperor is just magnificent played to sinister perfection by Ian McDiarmid. If Darth Vader made me love villains, The Emperor makes me want to be them more than anything. Soon the Rebels learn of the new Death Star and have to of course, take it out. But there's a hitch, it has a shield surrounding it and the only way to deactivate the shield is to destroy the shield generator before their fleet arrives to begin their assault on the Death Star. And this is where our Rebel friends meet the Ewoks, and this is either the second most hated life form in Star Wars history next to Jar Jar Binks, or is the most cute and adorable thing ever introduced into Star Wars. I am shocked at how divided people are to these little teddy bear looking things, I thought they were cute and harmless even though they make a mockery of my beloved Empire. So anyway, Luke confronts Vader on Endor and Vader takes him to The Emperor. So now we have a three way battle in this film, the fight to take out the shield generator, the fight to take out the Death Star, and the fight to defeat Darth Vader and The Emperor. And all the fights are really well done, but of course the final duel between Luke and Vader is the showstopper, there is so much emotion in this fight, more so than I think in any Star Wars movie. True, the duel between Luke and Vader in Cloud City is the best of the original trilogy, but this has serious emotions charging this fight, I mean there is a point where Luke just snaps. He is coming at Vader with all of his resolve and all of his anger, and this is not one of those carefully choreographed fight scenes you see in the prequels, Luke is swinging his lightsaber like a bat just hitting everything and really catching Vader off guard to the point where he cuts Vader's right hand off to reveal he has a robot hand just like Luke. So he defeats Darth Vader and The Emperor is just taunting Luke to kill him and Luke just won't do that. So he throws his lightsaber down, saying he will never turn to the dark side and he is a Jedi like his father before him. So The Emperor decides if he will not join us he will die, and then he proceeds to shoot lightning out of his fingers!! The Jedi can go screw themselves for all I care, this was the final moment that made me fully embrace the Empire and the dark side! I'd love to see the Jedi try that. So The Emperor is just torturing Luke, surging his body with electricity as he is begging Darth Vader to save him, and this is a great moment. You see the camera zoom in on Darth Vader's face and you can tell he's really conflicted and he still has the mask on and everything. So he looks to Luke and back to his master, picks The Emperor up over his head and throws him over a railing into the reactor where he disintegrates. Meanwhile the Rebels destroy the shield generator and they send in the fighters to destroy the Death Star, so Luke has to get out of there and he takes Darth Vader with him, and he asks Luke to take his mask off because he is dying and he wants to see his son with his own eyes. I'm sorry! I spoiled the surprise, but it's very difficult to talk about this movie without giving that away! So Luke obeys his father and slowly takes his mask off to reveal the scarred face of Anakin Skywalker, who tells Luke he saved him and to leave him, but Luke refuses and watches his father die and escapes the Death Star before it is blown up. At the celebration on Endor, Luke creates a funeral pyre for his father and burns his body. Later he sees the spirits of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda watching over him.",1526256000,,5200,4.242943548387097
