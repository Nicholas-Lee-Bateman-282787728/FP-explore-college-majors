However, something like this needs to be produced for beginners up to expert.  In addition, they really do need to produce something of better quality.",1439164800,,284,4.9787234042553195
8675541,5,B00N195N5E,"Soon after purchasing this dvd, I became engaged in a physical confrontation. A man at the breast tavern called me a vulva. Thank god I viewed this material previous to my experience. I knocked this gentleman out on the first shot! I know! The pure insanity of it all! This dvd gives outstanding instruction on how to pummel posteriors. Not only was it useful in it's step by step instruction on how to deliver cranial rocking fist explosions, it also prepared me for escalatory confrontation vernacular. The man wishing to do me great bodily harm used language that was moderately offensive - and down right intimidating. I looked at him and chuckled. I thought,""I just watched this video at home."" I bought two other dvd's from this company. Feral Fighting, and First Strike. In all seriousness, these products were impressive and I am gratefull for them.",1417046400,2,857,4.876712328767123
8675542,5,B00N195N5E,"Too many schools gloss over how to throw great punches. In ""Power Punching"" Sammy Franco provides simple drills that help you develop powerful punches. My favorite aspect of the DVD was that he went into a lot of punching footwork, which I honestly knew very little about beforehand. I recommend this video to anyone wanting to learn how to throw massive punches.",1415232000,,363,4.870967741935484
