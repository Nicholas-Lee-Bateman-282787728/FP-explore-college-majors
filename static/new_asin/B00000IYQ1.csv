8172457,1,B00000IYQ1,"This DVD was sold to me and advertised as having ""Jack Elam"" as one of the actors. Jack Elam was not in this DVD and he had no part in its production. Instead of Jack Elam I got 83 minutes of bad acting, bad script, and nothing but grunts and growns. If you are a Jack Elam an DO NOT BUY this DVD. Jack Lam the star of this DVD is nothing like the real Jack Elam. I also would not wish this DVD on even those lovers of NINJA movies.",1318118400,,432,3.758241758241758
8172458,1,B00000IYQ1,This is a pretty sub-standard Kung-Fu flick.  Actually the supposed good guys who are supposed to be so tuff after getting all this advanced training (which it hardly shows) spend most of the movie getting their butts handed to them and running away.  In fact they are useless alone and have to fight together to do any good.  Plot was pretty confusing and fight scens were weak throughout.  And there is not even a single mention of anything related to a Ninja.  I am sure they just threw that title in to try to sell this piece of crap.  I got this video for free and I still paid too much!!!!,1119830400,,595,4.315315315315315
