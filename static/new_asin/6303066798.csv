There is so much more here than you would expect from a concert...color, dance, music.  I was  awestruck!
There were two songs that I was unfamiliar with, and there  were many songs that I would have thought you could hear at any Madonna  show that were not played, but in the end, I don't think anything could  have been changed to make it a better show.",914284800,2,468,4.32183908045977

560636,5,6303066798,"Great show! Indeed, Madonna has always known how to present yourself and to surprise the audience. If we think back to all of her concert tours, we come to the indescribable admiration. Because every show is an amazing spectacle. And this concert tour 1993 is proof of that. We can enjoy the wonderful game of musicians and dancers. This is show is full of eroticism, desire to surprise and conquer the audience with his extravagance and individuality. Madonna, as always, brilliantly managed to show itself in all its glory. On this tour she sang songs from various Studio albums. It really was a holiday of merriment and good cheer. Way to go, Madonna!",1433808000,,654,4.79646017699115
560637,5,6303066798,"the girlie show is one of madonna's most under-rated tour and projects that she has done.  the execution was flawless.  the dancing and choreography and dancers with their own stories and routines also culminate in one of the most glamorous tour in world history.  the tour also has a free, easy feeling that is easily transcending her most relaxed, laid back and even comedic performance.  she wanted to be ironic and funny and push boundaries.  she wanted the world to take note of the explicit nature of the work and say a collective, ""screw you"".  she shows new sides and dimensions of herself in this tour, and that is amazing for someone who has had a reasonably long career as a superstar at this point.  madonna works hard, and she really took this tour to a new high level of extreme for the medium of the live show.  madonna has reinvented the stage performance and has had more influence on modern concert tours in the pop genre for over 30 years!!  yes, that is 30 years!!! unheard-of.  madonna is limited in her vocal ability, but she more than makes up for it by being a trooper and giving the best show that she is physically able to give.  that is not something that you read in every review you hear about an artist on tour.",1432166400,,1241,4.471111111111111

When the concert began, the sound and words were off.  So it appeared Madonna was poorly lip synching, Like a bad Asian movie.
After about 30minutes into the concert the singing became in synch with the music and everything was good.

560746,5,6303066798,"The Girlie Show is one of Madonna's best efforts. The Show is set during her Erotica period and most of the songs are from that album.

Erotica. 4. Deeper and Deeper. 5. Vogue. Madonna was still very much in your face with her sexuality at the time of this tour and shows in the song selections. The only bad parts of the DVD are the fact that it has only Dolby Sound and No DTS track the Dolby sound is weak, and for some reason the show is full screen instead of letterbox.

560856,5,6303066798,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that until today, I had only heard the name Madonna but never seen or heard her. Having watched the DVD, I went over to old faithful Wikipedia and read the entry on her. Quite a career.
So what does someone, not of her general audience, think of this show. Colorful. Hyperactive. Lively beat. Songs subordinated to Dance. Well organized. Focused on a whirling dervish of a performer. What seems today to be a mild erotic flavor almost lost in the general vigor of the movements.
Overall: Happy to have seen it",1258761600,,556,4.57

560859,2,6303066798,"Well, I was kinda excited to get this dvd because I was really getting into Madonna around this time.  I found her SEX book to be pretty entertaining, which I think is what it was meant to do, entertain.  I also thought that her Erotica album was her best album up until that point and I still think it is one of her best (tied with Bedtime Stories).  On this dvd I was expecting to see a very sensual, erotica-charged show.  It started out promising, M coming out of the stage with a riding crop, raccoon mask, and the tall boots.  Then she started lip-synching Erotica.  Oh no, what had she done?  Then you have a few good songs, then the travesty of Like a Virgin, enough has been said about this performance, so I won't go into detail.  I stopped really paying attention after that.  The song selection was really good, but the execution of those songs was pretty poor.  I really wish they would release Blonde Ambition on dvd, now that was a good concert.  I know all the M fans out there will hate me for not giving her 5 stars just because its Madonna.  P.S.  If any of you out there are fans of the Erotica-era Madonna, then you should all check out The Genitorturers.  Great band, hot lead singer, and awesome live show!",1229126400,4,1229,4.333333333333333

Much of the rest of the show is very cheesy though, especially ""Like A Virgin"" - one of the worst ways she's ever presented it.

Spectacular.",1171497600,2,331,4.655172413793103
560899,5,6303066798,"Recently, I've been taking-in the numerous pleasures of Madonna via her ""Sex"" book era of Erotica and Romance. Purchasing the CD of the single's title and picking up this concert at the same time, seemed a fiery mesh of beauty that I hoped I could handle all at once.

 Luckily: I couldn't.

 While I had read many other reviews ranging from mild interest to love to absolute hate, I decided to tune out all else I had experienced and just focus on the Lady M. My final verdict? Complete and utter dancing, early 90's era bliss.

 Over the past few years, I've found Madonna's performances rather lacking. While I always considered the ""Drowned World Tour"" her best effort, there were moments I wished had been taken out of the set list, along with other aspects of her recently completed ""Confessions Tour."" At times, these two concerts took things a little bit too seriously, with Madonna so full of her spiritual self that it distracted from all other sequences appearing behind her. A shining example of such would be the interlude of Dancers' Confessions that paved the way for Madonna's ""Live to Tell"" during the NBC Broadcast of ""Confessions."" The whole routine was horridly produced and cliched beyond belief, made all the worse by the fact that Madge was taking it all to heart. She was ruining herself under all these trying-too-hard efforts at shock that it was really quite . . . laughable.

 However, ""The Girlie Show"" is nothing short of spectacular! Where as other tours have been parody-worth due the over-the-top seriousness, this concert was pure and simple fun. If anyone else had tried to pull off some of the antics contained on this DVD, they would be the stock of laugh of the entire country. However, Madonna makes it all work in some odd choreographed way. No matter how crazy or insane the spectacle becomes, you can continually see Madonna laughing, smiling, and singing through the sweat, making for a great concert of high energy, leaving undertones at the door.

 The epitome occurs with ""I'm Going Bananas,"" an infectiously silly rendering of Spanish style music and fun circus-style entertainment, which, at the end of the day, makes up the meat of ""The Girlie Show.""

 ""Erotica""...""Bye Bye Baby""...""The Beast Within""...""Justify My Love"" - It's all one night of pure perfection.

 ~Highly recommended~",1169856000,,2333,4.903307888040713
560900,5,6303066798,"I loved this concert! I always liked the routine she did for Bye Bye Baby. Very clever. She had a very tight band on this tour, including Omar Hakim on drums, who has played with Sting and many other artists. He keeps the beat like no one else. This was such a playful show. Her later tours were a bit political in overtone, but this tour was like a circus. I much prefer Madonna in this context. No message - just singing and dancing. Hot.",1161129600,2,440,4.188235294117647
560901,4,6303066798,"Dont get me wrong I love Madonna. She beautiful, provocative, talented, and all those things. But this is my least favorite concert, the concert was in support to her racy album Erotica and it was around the time her infamous but 5 star Sex Book was released. She had a few lows during the concert (i.e. Like A Virgin,Vogue,and La Isla Bonita) but she performed her new hits with style and originality! Deeper and Deeper, Erotica, Bye Bye Baby,Fever, Why Its So Hard, and Rain. Madonna was working her bottom off it seemed during the elaborate show. The Girlie Show was splendid, again not one of her best such as Drowned World or Confessions Tour. But would would defiently recommend this its a great item to have for any fan and its an exotic show to be watched. Many will LOVE! Its very racy in some seens, it should be for kids 13 - 15 and up (recommended).",1156723200,4,861,4.455696202531645
560902,2,6303066798,"Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like ""Vogue"" and ""Express Yourself"" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived ""Like A Virgin.""  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but ""Virgin"" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with accordian, unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a stunning lapse in judgment
and boring to boot!!!  By the end of this miscalculated number, it's clear that Madonna should have left the Circus (the theme that runs through the show) to the likes of Cirque du Soleil!

The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of ""Holiday,"" which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp, with Madonna at full command of a military call-and-response cadence.  But even here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats!  Still, one look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for.  I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available.  Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!",1153958400,10,2202,4.983606557377049
560903,4,6303066798,"The period between 1992 and 1994 was a very strange time for Madonna. It was during this period that a pubic backlash was brought against her after doing what many felt was crossing the line by releasing the infamous coffee table book ""Sex"" and the dark, aptly titled ""Erotica"". She continued to push the limits with her 1993 film ""Body Of Evidence"", which alienated even more fans. Still, Madonna had a huge fanbase around the world, and, being ever resilient, she did what she does best: she did a tour.

This concert, taped in Australia in 1993, is, well quite a show. Even most Madonna fans will tell you it's like nothing you have ever seen before.

The show opens with a brief introduction, which includes a nude dancer writhing on a dance pool, among other enticements. Than, Madonna emerges to perform a, well, erotic, version of ""Erotica"". This pretty much sets the mood for the show. The performance of the song is rather flat and lifeless, but the choreography is great. In fact, much of the dancing is better than the actual performances. ""Fever"" picks up the slack, with Madonna coming alive and really delivering a powerful performance. ""Vogue"" is up next. This was probably my favorite part of the show. This version is better than the studio version, Madonna sounded great, the dancing was spectacular and everything was perfect. The pace slows down with ""Rain"", which is performed rather nicely. Then, things come roaring back to life with an explosive performance of ""Express Yourself"", which segues into a less impressive but equally enjoyable ""Deeper & Deeper"". ""Why's It So Hard"" is a song I hadn't heard before. The song is really good, and the performance goes well. ""In This Life"" is a beautiful dedication to two of her friends who died of AIDS. She performed it nicely. Next comes the weird part. Madonna runs backstage for a costume change. Some strange, creepy music plays that turns out to be a remix of ""Justify My Love"". Played over it is Madonna talking about some creepy religious mumbo jumbo while two male dancers, err, danced on each other. This was becoming disturbing, so I changed it.

Next comes what is both the most disappointing and interesting part of the show. On every tour, Madonna has always come up with intriguing ways of performing ""Like A Virgin"". On her controversial 1990 ""Blonde Ambition"" tour, she sang the song while being, um, ""pleasured"", by two male dancers dressed in cone bras. On this tour, Madonna doesn't even sign it. Rather, she speaks out the whole song in a Marlene Dietrich influenced German accent, complete with a suit and top hat. This, while amusing, makes the song sound akward and really drags it out. But it's fun to watch. Next comes ""Bye Bye Baby"", which is a great song and is made better thanks to the choreography, which once again takes centerstage. ""I'm Going Bananas"" is funny, but since I hate that song, I won't waste my time talking about it. ""La Isla Bonita"" is done great. The mood is very subdued, and Madonna does a very nice version. ""Holiday"" is done as a patriotic number, which includes a marching band like interlude complete with a chant dedicated to Australia. It's funny, but it gets tedious after awhile. Next comes ""Justify My Love"". Now, I never liked this song, and here it irks me more than ever. Why? Because Madge is so blatantly lip synching it's not even funny. She tries hard to mask it but she makes it all the more obvious. Closing the show is ""Everybody is A Star/Everybody"", a 10 minute medley that closes things with a bang.

Overall, this was a great show. As I said, it's quite strange, but it's fun. But keep in mind that even though it's a concert film, it earns its R rating. That being said, I'd recommend it to most people.",1135814400,2,3745,4.686930091185411

560905,5,6303066798,"In 1993, Madonna put together THE GIRLIE SHOW TOUR 1993, her fourth tour. On November 19, 1993, Madonna performed in Sydney, Australia, and then put that concert on this amazing DVD.

EROTICA
The show starts off with the band the music to this song, while one of Madonna's female dancers (having four female dancers & four male dancers) descends a go-go pole, topless. She reaches the bottom as Madonna comes up to perform this incredible version of ""Erotica"". She wears a black sequenced bikini top, a black half-top muscle vest, black gloves, black sequenced shorts, fishnet stockings, gothic black stilettos, a black eye mask, and her hair in a boyishly styled haircut.

FEVER
After finishing ""Erotica"", Madonna descends a staircase, taking off the vest and mask, leaving on the bikini top, shorts, stockings, and boots to perform the video version of her rendition of the Peggy Lee classic, ""Fever"". While performing, two of her male dancers join her on stage.

VOGUE
After finishing ""Fever"", Madonna goes back for one quick costume change. Madonna's backup vocalists, Donna DeLory & Niki Harris, appear on stage, wearing the same outfits as Madonna in her first two songs performed, but they are also wearing black beaded headdresses. All eight of Madonna's dancers are wearing black sparkled Arabian vests, along with black Arabian baggy-like pants, sort of like Aladdin and his Genie. Madonna comes out to perform an Arabian styled version of ""Vogue"", wearing the same shorts, boots, and stockings from the first two performances. Her top is different, for the section covering her chest is made up of gray beads, where the top's straps are black. On her head is a gigantic black beaded headdress.

RAIN
After finishing ""Vogue"", Madonna, Niki, & Donna put on black see-through dresses over their ""Vogue"" outfits. They grab three stools, take a seat and give a beautiful rendition of ""Rain"". If you listen to the album version, you'll hear a two-way spoken interlude by Madonna, but since Madonna couldn't do that two-way spoken interlude live, she decided to sing a verse from the infamous Marvin Gaye hit, ""Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)"". After the JMI interlude, Madonna goes back into ""Rain"". As she finishes the song, some of the dancers come out and dance to a ballet version of Fred Astaire's, ""Singin' In The Rain"".

EXPRESS YOURSELF
After finishing ""Rain"", Madonna descends to the stage, while sitting on a huge 70s Disco Ball, wearing a 70s Purple half-top w/ bell-bottom sleeves, purple sequenced shorts, pink 70s styled high-heeled shoes, complete with a blonde Afro wig to perform a 70s Disco rendition of ""Express Yourself"". She is joined by Donna & Niki, who are also 70s dressed.

DEEPER AND DEEPER
After finishing ""Express Yourself"", Madonna, Donna, & Niki, still in their 70s outfits are joined by the eight dancers, who enter the scene wearing 70s outfits, where Madonna performs ""Deeper And Deeper"". She sings the song up until after the bridge, where Madonna, Donna, Niki, & the dancers have a dance-out, leading into them rolling over the stage, grabbing each other sexually, having just one big orgy.

WHY'S IT SO HARD
After finishing ""Deeper And Deeper"", Madonna's 70s Disco Sex Segment turns into the plead for peace, where she takes off her afro wig & 70s purple top. She leaves on her shorts, shoes, and a flowered-like bra to perform ""Why's It So Hard"".

IN THIS LIFE
After finishing ""Why's It So Hard"", Madonna goes solo by singing the next song by herself; a song Madonna had written and recorded for two friends of hers, who have passed away due to AIDS.

Dancers Interlude: JUSTIFY MY LOVE (THE BEAST WITHIN MIX)
After finishing ""In This Life"", Madonna goes for another costume change as the dancers dance to Madonna's ""Beast Within Mix"" of ""Justify My Love"", where the dance consumes of Love, Hate, Sex, Passion, & Destruction.

LIKE A VIRGIN
After Madonna's costume change, Madonna comes out in a 1920s tuxedo, complete with tails and a top hat, to perform ""Like A Virgin"". Madonna, instead of singing the song, speaks the song in a Marlene Dietrich German accent, making the song Marlene Dietrich influenced.

BYE BYE BABY
After finishing ""Like A Virgin"", Madonna remains in the tux and is joined by Niki & Donna, who are dressed as Madonna is to perform a Lesbian burlesque version of ""Bye Bye Baby"". The Lesbian burlesque dancers are three of Madonna's female dancers.

I'M GOING BANANAS
After finishing ""Bye Bye Baby"", Madonna, Donna, & Niki have a foul-mouthed discussion about women and they head into the Latin-flavored ""I'm Going Bananas"", where the three take off their tux tops, to reveal Madonna in a blue & white horizontally striped muscle shirt.

LA ISLA BONITA
After finishing ""I'm Going Bananas"", Madonna gives a great performance of ""La Isla Bonita"", finishing with a dance finale with all four of her male dancers.

HOLIDAY
After finishing ""La Isla Bonita"", Madonna, Niki, Donna, and the dancers come out in military drag to perform a military styled version of ""Holiday"", where Madonna shows her James Brown impersonation.

JUSTIFY MY LOVE
After ""Holiday"", Madonna comes back for Encore #1. She, Niki, Donna, & the dancers are dressed in 1870s Victorian outfits from the Horse Racing scene in the film, ""My Fair Lady"". With these outfits, Madonna performs, ""Justify My Love""

Medley: EVERYBODY IS A STAR/EVERYBODY
After ""Justify My Love"", Madonna comes back for Encore #2. Madonna wears a yellow shirt, with short blue jean shorts and low-ankle boots. She starts off by singing the second verse of Sly & The Family Stone's ""Everybody Is A Star"", which leads into Madonna singing, ""Everybody"".

This concert is for every Madonna fan alike around the world and back. The costume changes are great, the setlist is great. What more can you want, I mean, besides wanting more Madonna?

560906,5,6303066798,"This is a great show along with the sound of her italian tour, and all of drowned world minus the sexual perversion.  Her sound is rich on all of her live DVDs.  I pump them all out on my dvd stereo system.  BUT WHERE IS THE BLOND AMBITION DVD???? Somebody get it out there so my madonna dvd live collection will be complete.  Do get girlie show if you like madonna.  A bit too much sex for me but the sound is good.",1122336000,,416,3.963855421686747
560907,5,6303066798,"I really enjoyed this show. It's a good follow up to Blonde Ambition. Here is what I like the most:

Erotica- She whips her black S&M whip, while whispering(well lip-synching)her lyrics. The song is great!!!!
Fever-She is joined by two her very hunky (man) dancers. They sort of do three-way sex dance.
Express Yourself-It's a disco dance theme.
In this Life-She does her best at singing this solo.
Justify my Love-Although it doesn't sound like the album version, it still has great electrnic beats. It's my favorite peformance.
It's fun, and very entertaining.",1118188800,,562,5.043010752688172
561008,3,6303066798,"I bought this DVD after being impressed by the performance clips for her previous tour (Blonde Ambition) featured in the Truth or Dare documentary, and because Erotica is my favorite Madonna album.

I found myself dissapointed.  ""Erotica"" is also my favorite Madonna single, and the main reason I bought the DVD.  The performance is terrible.  Madonna looks great, but the choreography is boring (she stands in one place, brandishing a riding crop) and the song sounds dreadful.  What is a great, intense song on the album, sounds watered down to the point of elevator music here.

""Deeper and Deeper"" is another of my favorites, and again I found myself dissappointed.  While not as bad as ""Erotica"" it seems to lack a lot of the energy it has on the album.

Ironically, the highlight for me was a song I figured I was sick of and couldn't possibly stomach hearing once more.  ""Express Yourself"" sounds totally rejuvinated.  ""Fever"" ""Rain"" ""La Isla Bonita"" are all well done.  ""Why's It So Hard"" starts with an orgy, and is one of the few songs I like better here than on album.  ""In This Life"" sounds good, but Madonna's performance seems kind of phony, considering it's such a personal song.  Plus, I would have much preferred to hear ""Bad Girl"", the only single from the Erotica album that isn't represented here.

""Bye Bye Baby"" and ""Justify My Love"" not only sound great, but are also visually excellent.  I found the show to be visually underwhelming much of the time, but these are the exceptions.

And the finale of ""Everybody is a Star/Everybody"" totally rocks.  Energy to spare, too bad some of it couldn't be transplanted to ""Erotica"".

In conclusion, an alright show.  If it's a choice between this and Drowned World, go with Drowned World.

So long as you don't foolishly pay $30.00 for the thing and have a fanatical relationship with the song ""Erotica"" you won't be dissapointed.

(I considered adding a star because Madonna looks so good with short hair, but that would be shallow.)",1112486400,3,1999,4.786549707602339
561009,4,6303066798,"This is definately a great show. It is very high powered from the beginning to the end. Madonna has so much energy in this tour. It was recorded in Syndey, Australia and most of the songs are from her Erotica album.

Its starts with Erotica. Madonna is dressed at Dita. If you like the video and the song you will love the peformance. After the performance she slowly walks down the catwalk with her 5"" heel boots and performs Peegy Lees rendition of Fever. Fever has a lot of energy to it and she dances with both her male dancers.  Vogue is an absolutely stunning performance with beautiful constumes and set up. Rain is breathtaking with the beautiful umbrellas being twirled around and you hear the rain and thunder. She slips ""its just my imagination"" in during Rain.

Express Yourself starts off with Madonna coming down a 70's ball and is all disco as well is Deeper and Deeper great constumes here too. Why Is It So Hard, starts after Deeper and Deeper and gets are little R rated, enough said. In This Life Madonna emotionally sings about a friend of hers who has died from Aids. She is not on during the Beast Within but you can hear her repeating the words from the Book Of Revelations. During Like  A Virgin; she is dressed up in a mans suit and sings in a different voice. I wish she had sang it with her voice like from the Blonde Ambition  Tour. It was rather slow and boring. Bye Bye Bye is funny and great and has all her female dancers are on and she plays the male role as she touches her female dancers.  I didn't care for I am going Bananas at all. She looks great when she sings La Isla Bonita very pretty. She performs her hit Holiday dressed up in military suits. It's very well coordinated and very well danced. There is a remix to Justify My Love near the end and  its better than the original song and the costumes she wore here are one of my favorites. It's end with Everybody, which not too bad. I give show a B+. You would be disappointed from beginning to end!! I highly recommend it!!",1112313600,,2016,4.3315649867374
561010,5,6303066798,"A year after she published her Sex book and released her Erotica album, Madonna decided to take her show on the road, this time with ten times the spectacle color, and grandeur of anything she'd done before, or arguably since. The Girlie Show was also Madonna's funnest tour. The overall theme here was ""vintage circus chic"" (if there ever was such a thing). Madonna takes the best elements of entertainment, voyeurism and spectacle, and packaged it into a smoothly flowing and cohesive sex-travaganza! The Girlie Shows influence can be found in everything from Studio 54 to classic hollywood, and from Victorian England to Weimar Berlin. The real highlights of this tour were the Deeper and Deeper segment (which ends in a frenzied orgy), Bye Bye Baby (affecting a turn of the century bulesque), La Isla Bonita (when ISN'T that a highlight?!) and particularly Justify My Love which turns the ""My Fair Lady"" Ascot scene into a dark, androgynous, and abstract event. Overall, this is arguably Madonna's most colorful and spectacular show ever. It is also noticeable that during this tour, Madonna is very close to the audience, a lot more than she had been before or since. I recommend this to every Madonna fan!",1107820800,,1211,4.9411764705882355
561011,4,6303066798,"Three years after the Blond Ambition tour came this one called ""The Girlie Show"", based mostly in her Erotica Album, this concert is more sexually charge than the former with naked girls, same-sex action and unappropiate rubbing, but if you are a Madonna fan you certainly can expect this.

The concert was filmed in Australia and is a colorful spectacular event with complex dancing routines, attractives dancer and the number one live performance show girl/star Madonna.

My favorite songs here were: Vogue ( a different version), Fever (very sexy), Express yourself/Deeper and Deeper (go go theme).

If you are a Madonna Fan is a must have, if not you better like her Erotica album since this is the basic inspiration for the tour, but as always is a great pleasure seeing Madonna live.",1104537600,2,789,4.917293233082707
561012,5,6303066798,"Almost 17 years passed since Madonna hit the road with her amazing Girlie Show, promoting one of her best ever album Erotica. It was all so special....the songs, the mood, the quality, the times. And I was only 18... Madonna then had guts to produce high quality, hi-end music, without caring about commercial aspects.

Now to the show - this was one of the greatest shows of 90's, both musically and stage-wise.  The sound quality (note: not on this DVD) of the actual show broke all the boundaries of the existing expectations. Live acts of Fever, Erotica were breathtaking. So many years passed since, I feel like Madonna herself is still underestimating or discriminating the Erotica period.

I wouldn't really say I love all of the performances on this DVD, however, the tour highlights like Erotica, Fever, Rain, Deeper and Deeper, La Isla Bonita, Justify my Love makes it all special. Visually, this recording is stunning. Given the time it was show, almost 17 years ago, the colors are amazingly fresh and vivid, except for some blurry moments. My biggest disappointment is the sound quality on this DVD. AC3 Digital Sound featured on US Version is such an embarrassment for the great show and Madonna herself. I still cannot believe that Madonna, the biggest quality freak in the world, has absolutely no control over the quality of her released materials. Given the available prints of this DVD, I would highly recommend to buy the European two-sided edition featuring Dolby Digital Stereo (the best sound available).

Now to the presents times of 2010 - with all the amazing restorations available on BlueRay, I see no justification for failing to release the Girlie Show on BlueRay, having both the video and sound restored into DTS7.1! And not only this concert...common Madonna, with all the hundreds of millions of dollars that you made thanks to your dedicated and insane fans, you should really invest some money into re-releasing your greatest albums and performances in BlueRay, DVD-Audio and/or DTS CD. We all deserve it, we do!

God Bless Queen!",1093824000,3,2066,4.976811594202899
561013,4,6303066798,"I own DVDs of Blond Ambition, Girlie Show, and Drowned World, and must say that Girlie show ranks third of the three. The show is the weakest because I find the music that Madonna released during this time to be some of the most forgettable of her career. She tries very hard to follow up her ""shocking"" Blond Ambition Tour with more shock and theatrics, but it just doesn't quite live up to it, and it seems that she tried too hard to shock us. Nevertheless, this is a solid performance. Like another post said, the theatrics and staging aren't as good as the other tours, but this tour was more about music and spectacle (read nudity and mass orgies). Sadly, however, the music just isn't as good. ""Rain"", ""Express Yourself"", and ""Justify My Love"" are the standouts. ""Why's it so Hard"" and ""In this Life"" are largely forgettable; ""Live to Tell"" and ""Bad Girl"" would have been better suited to this segment, but I am not Madonna, nor am I (...). That may be why it doesn't appeal to me as much. The only segment in which this concert tops  Blond Ambition is Madonna's voice. She sings virtually all of the material, something she cannot claim in Blond Ambition, where almost half the numbers performed sport some sort of vocal sweeting, whether it be backing tracks she sings over (Express Yourself) half singing half lipping (Open Your Heart), or just outright lip synching (Vogue). In contrast, only three songs are canned during The Girlie Show, if only the songs she sang were more enjoyable musically. The dancing also had its hits and misses. ""Vogue"" is no longer ""en vogue"" with  hand movements that must be viewed from row three to see, butlook great when viewed on the DVD, while ""La Isla Bonita"" is a show stopper. The show begins slowly, ""Vogue"" or ""Bye Bye Baby"" should have opened the show, as Erotica is a rather listless way to open a live performance with no vocal oomph, even if she was lip synching. Overall, this was not the best Madonna concert, but  she did what she needed to do, and sold out every show. Most of the show is enjoyable with the skip button being used for most of the middle of the show, that's how i view it anyway. I would recomend this concert only if you cannot spot the money it takes to import Blond Ambition from Japan or Europe, or Drowned World is just to dark for your taste. Girlie Show certainly shrouds nothing.",1088726400,2,2362,4.526932084309133
561014,5,6303066798,"The circus-like concert begins with a topless dancer slowly sliding down a tall pole.  When the dancer disappears behind the curtain, an S&M costumed Madonna mimes to a remix of ""Erotica"" on a turning platform.
""Fever"" is next, with Madonna seductively flirting with two male dancers.  Quickly, Madonna adds a head dress and mimes to ""Vogue"" with Donna, Niki and all of her dancers with amazing choreography.  Later, Donna, Niki and Madonna sit on chairs to perform ""Rain.""  A circus-like interlude takes place.
The stage becomes a 70's discotheque, as Madonna (dressed in 70's attire and an afro wig) descends from the cieling on a disco ball.  Donna and Niki join her to perform a 70's style ""Express Yourself"" and ""Deeper and Deeper,"" which turns into an onstage orgy between Madonna and her dancers.  Immediately following is ""Why's it So Hard"" and ""In This Life.""
Another costume change follows, with ""The Beast Within"" playing and two male dancers portraying homosexual intercourse, sibling rivalry, and acrobatic partnership.
Madonna shows up onstage in a tuxedo and performs ""Like a Virgin"" in a masculine voice and German accent.  The now transvestite Donna and Niki show up for a lesbian performance of ""Bye Bye Baby.""  The mood quickly morphs from ""Screw You"" to ""Soy Loca"" when the song ""I'm Going Bananas"" from Madonna's ""I'm Breathless"" is performed, with ""La Isla Bonita"" to follow.
After Madonna rambles on the stage about stealing from hotels, nose mucous and being short, the dancers all dress in military garb to perform ""Holiday.""
""Justify My Love"" is the first encore, and delivers spectactularly in the artistic aspect of the show.  Dressed in a top hat, sunglasses (or an eye patch, depending on the performance), she mimes to ""Justify My Love"" as more circus shenanigans ensue.
""Everybody is a Star / Everybody"" is next, while Madonna, dressed in a yellow Adidas shirt (or a white tube top, depending on the performance) dances, sings, and ""gets up to do her thing."" She introduces her band in the song, as well as her ""sisters"" Donna De Lory and Niki Haris. The show closes with perfection, and leaves the audience stunned and wanting more.",1088553600,3,2165,4.975069252077562
561015,5,6303066798,"1993 wasn't the best year for Madonna. She had lost alot of fans after the sex book and body of  evidence movie as well as  the Erotica album (probably one of her most overlooked albums). In the last bit of 1993 she decided to go back on the road witth the Girlie show.
She looks absolutely fabulous here with that hair style and the costumes. I would say the Girlie Show is her best tour so far.  i have yet to see the 'blonde ambition tour' az it isn't out on dvd or video. I have seen snipits  of it from the in bed with madonna film,  however.
There isn't an aspect  of this tour that is boring. every second of the tour  has you on the edge of your seat or ready to jump up and dance. With her Re-invention tour coming later on this year, i hope to see some of these greeats from the Erotica album once again. Hopefully it will be on DVD by christmas 2004!

Originally shown on HBO, Blonde Ambition (thank god i have a vhs copy) is the best concert she has done so far(covers all her classic hits and has the best stage setting she has ever had) with her Drowned tour coming in at 2nd place. The Girlie show has is moments but the are parts that you want to skip (especially the horrendus version of Like a Virgin. What was she thinking?? it would have been been better is she hadnt performed it at all). The show tries to be shocking but it comes up short. The dancing is good and her band is as tight as ever. The stage set was rather weak. If you want the best show that she has ever done i suggest you wait for the release of The Blonde Ambition Tour.

561085,5,6303066798,"Madonna is well known for her fantastic and extravagant stage shows, and this tour was no exception.
Filmed in Australia in 1993, this was Madonna's last world tour for 8 years (until the Drowned World Tour) and followed her stunning and adventurous Erotica album.
Highlights of this show include the start: a topless dancer climbs seductively down a large go-go pole, and as she disappears into the stage, Madonna appears in sparkly hotpants, top and s&m mask, brandishing a whip as she turns seductively and in time to the sexy single, Erotica.  Its a truly stunning and exciting entrance...
She moves through a range of hits, 'Fever', 'Vogue', 'Rain' and in Express Yourself, she appears from the top of the stage on a large disco ball, complete with purple afro, set to a fantastic and energised 70's remix of the song.
More hits follow, 'Deeper And Deeper', 'Why's It So Hard', 'In This Life', 'The Beast Within', until she appears dressed in a mans suit, for the Marlene Dietrich inspired Like A 'W'irgin (yes, I spelt it right).
'Bye Bye Baby', 'I'm Going Bananas' follow, and then a fantastic flamenco dance sequence for La Isla Bonita, followed by tour classic, Holiday (she alters this for every tour).
Justify My Love is extraordinary, as Madonna enters the stage in an amazing outfit (she appears to be 15 foot tall!), inspired by the horse racing scene from My Fair Lady, a truely surreal moment in the concert, with the song turning very 60's towards the end!
She finishes with Everybody / Everybody is a Star, and leaves you wanting more more more...
This is an exciting, sexy show, and even in the humourous moments (I'm Going Bananas) thoroughly enjoyable.  It makes me wish I could live it all again! (oh...I can...I have the dvd! ha ha)

561093,5,6303066798,"I remember travelling to London to see Madonna's opening night of this Tour in September 1993.  I was very excited & moreso because up until that point I thought that the Blonde Ambition was the most lavish spectacular ever brought to stage & screen.  What could Madonna do next?  The Girlie Show is definitely not a duplication of Madonna's 1990 Tour.  Lavish, yes, but it does not go the Greatest Hits route.  Madonna at the time was getting a lot of bad press due to the nature of her Sex book (which is very bland really) & her Erotica album (which I feel is one of her best).  The Girlie Show therefore had to be something else & it is.  Lipsyncing aside (Erotica/Justify My Love/Vogue), The Girlie Show is an impressive hommage to spectacles of old from harlequins to troubadours, 70s Disco & Deitrich, Madonna's Tour demonstrates her cultural awareness & her influences.  The show, like the Blonde Ambition Tour is divided into segments.
SEGMENT 1: The Dita files.  A series of darker dance numbers performer by Madonna in her Dita outfit.  Erotica, the show's opener is Madonna's sole presence on stage, with dancers in the background.  Good for what it is. But does not get the juices flowing, as the songs lyrics promise. Fever rocks - not one of my fave songs by Madonna, but she gives it plenty of life & sings it live! as well - she lipsynced to this one in London. Quite a sexy routine also with 2 dancers.  Madonna flirts with the crowd. Vogue is an elaborate spectacle, with Madonna, Nikki & Donna wearing what look chandeliers on their heads, & indulge in artsy dancing.  Cool.  Rain demonstrates Madonna can sing & harmonise.
SEGMENT2: 70s DISCO. This part of the show is a partayyyy sequence with a totally blinding version of Express Yourself, moving into the feather boa dance routine of Deeper & Deeper, before slowing down a bit for Why's It So Hard & then In This Life, which has Madonna alone on the steps singing about lost friends. Bless.
SEGMENT3: WHAT IS GOING ON? SECTION: Madonna does Like A Virgin as Marlent Deitrich, dressed up as a man flirts outrageously with dancing girls on Bye Bye Baby & then proceeds into the most unexpected live! song ever - I'm Going Bananas.  Nuts.
THE HITS: We then move into a wondrous rendtion of La Isla Bonita, spanish dancing et al & then a Military version of Holiday, which gets the audience livened up & Madonna genuinely appears to be enjoying herself & smiling without force.
The traditional expression save the best for last is true here.  The encores are two very different sounds & images.  Madonna goes to Ascot Horse Racing is the theme of Justify My Love, a very decadent type of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, with eloquent top hats, tails & lavish dresses (which is more 1920s than 1780s).  Madonna's outfit is a combination of man-woman.  The song is sultry & one I would never have imagined to be done live.  It livens up at the end with the dancers all performing a hand-clapping routine.  Bonkers.  The showstopper is again a song I was not expecting, yet one of my faves.  A totally reworked version of Everybody which breaks into Dance To The Music & then becomes all funky.  It is euphoric & the total climax to the show IMHO.  Add to this a secret clown who turns out to be Madonna & you have the impression that depsite the lack of greater hits like Papa Don't Preach/Open Your Heart, etc that Madonna does want to entertain her crowd & moreover interact with them.  She does so well, or at least as warmly as I've ever seen her.  Bad press asides, the sheer content of the show alone is enough to remind fans why they attended the show (& there are A LOT at this show - & she played 4 nights at this cricket ground as well as performing in other Australian cities!!!!) & why Madonna is one of the best at her game",1009843200,53,3799,4.524158125915081

561135,3,6303066798,"I have no CD of Madonna. But I watched her live concerts in LD format 10 years ago. And I've watched the LDs - Italy Concert and Tokyo concert- more than a hundred times.
  When I could managed to have DVD hometheatre system, I decided to buy a concert DVD of Madonna first.  As I'd already had ""Ciao Italia"", I bought ""The Girlie Show"", the latest concert of her.
  But it was not as active as ""Ciao Italia"". And remixed versions of my favorite songs were bad. Especially, ""LIke a Virgin"" is the WORST remixed version. I didn't know that song was the ""Like a Virgin"" even until it finished. But audio quality of ""the girlie show"" is good.
  If you ask me,however, I recommend the Italy Concert,""Ciao Italia"".

561137,2,6303066798,"I consider myself highly appreciative of Madonna -- her singing, dancing, acting, her intelligence and innovation, etc. But this production featured only occasional memorable performances. Madonna does not look good in short, blond hair -- but she looks much worse doing performances in men's clothes, chiffon wigs and top hats! The choreography was not very special. The rendition of ""Like a Virgin"" was completely innovative -- and completely throw-away. As another reviewer stated, much of this video needed the fast-forward button. I cannot understand why so many people liked this production. I not only will never watch it a second time, I won't even keep it in my collection.  Yes, ""Truth or Dare"" is MUCH better!",999993600,4,720,5.206896551724138
561138,5,6303066798,"This dvd shows that madonna is still on top. her ""Girlie Show"" tour followed the ""blond ambition tour 90"" in 1993. It is an amazing show. I have watched this show over and over again and am constantly mesmorized by Madonna's talent on stage. Her voice is amazing. Well, except for some lip-syning on 'Erotica', 'Vogue', and 'Justify my Love'. But the undisputed queen of pop makes up for these voice illusions with her dancing and perfect singing on songs like 'la isla bonita'.
Though this madonna tour was filled with a lot of the songs from her EROTICA album, once you sit down and watch it a couple of times, you start to learn and enjoy some of her newer songs at this time and the way she preforms them with her crew. As always, her longtime backup singers, Niki and Donna, are along side her for the ride. They are also fabulous.
This DVD is a Must for ANY madonna fan on anyone who is curious about one of her concerts. Madonna obviously preforms this one with added enthusiasm, because she knew it would be on hbo. So pick up this DVD and you will be able to see why so many people look to Madonna as some type of Godess.
WARNING: This DVD is rated R for many reasons. It is not for the viewing of children. Simulated orgys and Sex make this DVD intended for a more adult audience.
HOPE: Though this Show was in 93', Madonna is once again touring again. And soon, that show will too come out on DVD and VHS. So get ready for the ""Drowned World Tour"", live from Michigan, Madonna's home town!!!! This one will be her best tour for sure!!",993686400,,1545,4.312714776632302
561139,5,6303066798,"This has got to be one of if not the best concert EVER staged in history.  Madonna puts on an elaborate production like no other.  This is not your typical pop concert but it holds you attention like nothing else.  You will be glued to your television every time you watch it.  After viewing this concert I must say that the U.S. really got jipped on this tour.  The tour only visited three U.S. cities.  You must buy this DVD!  It is a great way to sike yourself up for her tour this summer!
NOT FOR CHILDREN!  THIS CONCERT IS FOR ADULTS!  IT WAS THE TOUR FOR MADONNA'S ""EROTICA"" ALBUM, AND ""SEX"" BOOK!",987465600,2,603,4.265486725663717
561140,5,6303066798,"Though I've never been to a live Madonna concert, watching this DVD has made me recognize all the preparation, costumes, coreography, etc. that go  into her Girlie ""Super"" Show.  Virtually every song requires a  new costume change.  The dancing is tight.  She performs a rather peculiar  rendition of ""Like a Virgin"", a fun retro version of  ""Express Yourself"", her classic and stylish ""Vogue"",  and other 80's to early 90's Madonna-fan favorites--basically up to her  Erotica album.
The sound quality is probably better than being at the  show, since you can actually hear her and the band perform over the  screaming crowd.  With a combination of camera cranes and Steadicam shots,  you get a great on-stage perspective of her show.
Madonna fans should  not be disappointed with this DVD at all.  In fact, you can crank up the  volume on your surround-sound home theatre system and lose yourself in the  great video and audio presentation of her show.",967852800,28,953,4.968152866242038
561141,5,6303066798,"Having seen the Girlie Show Live in Istanbul, I can assure you that this DVD is the next best thing to actually seeing her perform. The DVD has outstanding picture and sound clarity/quality, probably because it was shot  digitally back in 1993 to be mastered for Laserdisc. There were, however, a  few shortcomings of this DVD that dissapointed me. The first disappointment  was its simple and not very visually appealing navigation controls.  Secondly the errors and omissions in its subtitles can become quite  annoying if you are an avid Madonna fan. Also, this DVD could easily have  had lots of extra footage (such as a tour schedule, interviews, etc.) but  apparently the producers chose not to go into any additional production and  decided to include nothing other than the show itself. Putting aside the  few drawbacks I listed above, this DVD is fantastic and a must have for any  fan or music lover.",955929600,6,910,4.888888888888889

There really aren't any ""best"" parts; the whole thing is the best part! I hope Madonna releases a new concert tape soon -- I understand she's on tour now or was on tour recently, and I hope she releases a concert tape of that tour; and I hope it's better than this, because then I'll be in for one hell of a show!  :)",954806400,,495,4.082474226804123

561194,3,6303066798,"I expected a lot from this DVD. And for ""a lot"" I mean good sound quality and some kind of screen play.
The good side: Madonna is great, as it's his music. The bad side: The making is a disaster. The sound  is *nothing* compared to live CDs, there are few cameras, and bad placed.
For the people who liked this, check out Tina Turner Live from  Amsterdand Arena (if possible, in DTS). That's how a concert should be  filmed. And check out Eagles' Hells Freezes Over for sound  quality.
Really, I didn't expect this DVD to be as good as any of these,  but it's *nothing* compared to them.  I wish Madonna can get a concert  filmed and recorded in the way she deservers.",948240000,14,668,4.296

Even with the shortest of hair, Madonna is  still visually stunning with all the EROTICA songs acted out by her and her  dancers.  I am TOTALLY mesmerized each and every time MADONNA is on stage  and the choreography is mind-boggling!  Madonna never gives anything but  100% and this DVD will knock your socks off!
