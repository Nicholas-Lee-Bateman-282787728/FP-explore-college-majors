3430663,4,B0019APR5S,"""The Great American Broadcast"" (20th Century Fox, 1941)
This frothy, energetic comedy is a loose-with-the-facts fictionalization of how radio became the great medium of the early 20th Century. Robust, good-natured John Payne (sort of the Brendan Fraser of his time) and comic sidekick Jack Oakie meet up around 1920 as two down-and-out World War One vets who share an interest in the then-new radio technology. Payne's character come up with the idea that maybe they could use this newfangled radio stuff to bring entertainment to people all across the country... and then they're off!  Of course, there's gotta be a girl, too and enter the ever-blonde girl next door, Alice Faye, as the gal they both love. But it ain't a love triangle -- nope! -- it's a square, because rich-cad tycoon Cesar Romero wants her too.  This is a pleasantly fast-paced, lighthearted film, packed with better-than-usual performances from Ms. Faye (she and Payne duet quite nicely together). There are also great cameos from the Ink Spots vocal group, a fabulous (but all-too-brief) dance number from the Nicolas Brothers, and a nice, dewy-eyed version of how radio came to America. It's a fun old film... they really don't make 'em like this anymore! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1225238400,6,1265,5.076923076923077
3430664,4,B0019APR5S,"In 1941, Alice Faye was at the peak of her success. Her films were usually made to a very successful formula whereby she suffered at the hands of an insensitive leading man - singing through tears. This film adheres rigidly to the cliches, combining scenes from ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" and ""Tin Pan Alley"", set to the advent of radio. The merits of the film are obvious:

- Alice herself, bright, amusing, energetic and very pretty
- A lively Jack Oakie on board for some hokey comedy
- John Payne, more animated than usual and with a real rapport with Faye
- first rate direction from Archie Mayo, a more dynamic director than the usual 20th Century Fox house directors. The film moves along with such speed that the cliches can almost be ignored
- an excellent Harry Warren score, particularly the haunting ""Where you Are"" which Alice sings in loving close up with the Ink Spots harmonising in the background
- outstanding supporting acts including the devastating dancing Nicholas Brothers and the witty and clever Wiere Brothers.

The production values are first rate with that great Fox sound and photography. As a history lesson, the script contains its share of inaccuracies and Faye's clothes are 1941 modern even though the film starts 20 years earlier but that was all part of the escapism.

The print has been restored and is in great condition. A very entertaining documentary is included. It ensures that the modern audience understand exactly how important radio was at the time and why the historical aspects of the film resonated with many members of the audience in 1941. The original trailer is included and the usual stills and advertising material. It seems that Alice Faye's qualities of warmth and naturalness are being rediscovered as well as that beautiful voice and this film is a worthy contributor to her re-birth. The DVD is excellent value as part of the Faye Collection Volume 2.",1211846400,16,1912,4.876923076923077

8273182,4,B0019APR5S,"A chance meeting between Chuck Hadley (Jack Oakie) and Rix Martin (John Payne) prompts the pair to do something special with radio, something no one else was doing, broadcasting music.  The would-be girlfriend of Hadley (Alice Faye as Vicki Adams) supplies the singing and they present their first broadcast in the rain.  A storm and bad reviews don't hamper the trio, for their next venture, they broadcast a boxing match.  After that, it's almost clear sailing.  Naturally, a bad plot gets in the way when Vicki falls for and marries Rix who turns out to be a hothead and a heal, ditching her the first chance he gets.  Even if the story is incredibly contrived, the amiability of Jack Oakie, Alice Faye, and Cesar Romero help to carry the show.  There are a number of specialty acts that also help, although a dance act and a physical comedy act seem a bit counterproductive for radio.  The comedy act presented soundless routines that must have had radio listeners thinking they lost the broadcast from time to time.  Funny faces and fancy footwork would go under appreciated until the advent of television.",1443312000,,1111,4.810526315789474

My being of the ""OLDER"" generation, and having been married almost 50 years to a man that was employed by a Broadcasting Network, it brought back some memories that had been forgotten.

8273187,3,B0019APR5S,"The Great American Broadcast(released May/41)stars,among others,Alice Faye as Vicki Adams,John Payne as Rix Martin,Jack Oakie as Chuck Hadley and Cesar Romero as Bruce Chadwick. It's a great cast,with the three principal stars having been grouped together last in the successful Tin Pan Alley the year before. Fox wanted to capitalize on that success but came up far short with this offering. It's a mix up of a script and the music credited to Warren and Gordon falls flat on its keester. They certainly wrote better,such as that for Orchestra Wives.
The story finds us in a Hollywood-ized version of the start of the popularity of the medium of radio. Jack Oakie is a lineman whose hobby is working with a radio set at home,sending out local broadcasts,and talking to other radio operators from afar. Payne is a broke flyer who meets Oakie,and he comes up with an idea to expand Oakie's hobby into a wider working income for all. Payne gets to also meet Oakie's girlfriend Faye. The two don't exactly make a good first impression but,as these movies usually go,you know that love will rear its head between the two eventually. Payne gets a $2,500.00 loan from Romero,whom he already owes a substantial amount to. Payne in turn invests into Oakies new and more powerful radio set. Their scheme works but they hit a plateau until Payne,the ideas man,hits on another scheme to broadcast the Dempsey/Willard fight free,to entice new customers and business. It works,and not only does it improve Payne and Faye's careers(they also get married),Oakie and Romero prosper as well.
Payne and Faye move to Chicago but their new radio station doesn't do as well as Oakie's and Romero's in New York. Romero secretly meets with Faye who asks Romero to invest in her and her hubbies station. Romero has originally wanted to buy them out! Romero relents and gives over the cash,but it is understood Payne would never find out. At a restaurant celebrating,Payne and Faye run into Romero and Oakie. Romero approaches the table and things lead to things,and the secret comes out. Payne is furious and walks out. At home Faye tries to console Payne but there is no use. Unfortunately,love giveth and love taketh away,and Payne and Faye split. Payne goes to South America while his bride stays home and on as singer over the airwaves for Oakie and Romero.
There are now multiple stations around the U.S. and comes the day when Romero and Faye are going to get married. Oakie knows Faye still loves Payne,so he concocts a phony ruse to get Payne home,which works. He finagles the two together during the movie titled finale and all live happily ever after.
This is just a boring plot with alot of sub par music. It is not that the stars were bad,they weren't. They just did the best they could with what little they had. The bright spots are the Wiere Brothers,the fabulous,original Ink Spots and as always the phenomenal dancing Nicholas Brothers.
Technically speaking the movie has been remastered well and is clear and crisp. There is a featurette on the film,the trailer,a photo gallery and a restoration comparison.
All in all a fair to middling movie. A great cast with a wasted script and a totally forgettable soundtrack. But for the Ink Spots,Nicholas and Wiere Brothers,the film wouldn't qualify for three stars.",1381622400,,3303,4.879003558718861
8273188,5,B0019APR5S,"The Great American Broadcast is a stunner of a film! Alice Faye fans will love all of her musical numbers here; she's right in the spotlight and she sings wonderfully, never looking better! Jack Oakie, The Ink Spots and a few others do some excellent numbers as well. The plot moves along at a good clip, never slowing down too much nor did it move too fast. The sets, choreography and cinematography all enhance the film, too.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Rix Martin (John Payne) who gets into a fight with telephone line workers including Chuck Hadley (Jack Oakie) when they want to hang wires over Rix's airfield, even though his airplane ride business turns out to be all washed up. (I know; why would Rix fight over a washed up business, but that's Hollywood for you.) Despite their fight, Chuck takes Rix back to his place to warm up after a huge rainstorm and Rix meets Chuck's ""girlfriend,"" Vicki Adams (Alice Faye). In addition, Chuck is one of a few pioneers in something called radio and although Rix thinks it's unusual he does admit that Chuck's idea is pretty interesting. With some financial help from Rix's old World War One buddy Bruce (Cesar Romero) Chuck, Rix and Vicki broadcast a local performance from the top of a warehouse and although the weather nearly ruins everything it's clear that Chuck and his friends are indeed on to something.

Rix is always getting ideas to make this new invention called radio bigger and better--to improve the signal so that many, many people can hear a live performance! Unfortunately, weather and a lack of reliable technology still get in their way. Finally, however, Rix gets the idea to do a live broadcast of the Willard-Dempsey fight--and wow, how that changes things around for radio as well as Rix, Vicki and Chuck--even Bruce!

But it doesn't change the fact that competition can turn even old friends into the fiercest competitors; everybody else wants into the act, too. Rix's radio station is almost broke and when Vicki goes to Bruce privately for a loan this sets off a chain of unexpected events that create a lot of problems.
I've already left out some details and I won't write much more so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did--suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything plays out.

Look also for a wonderful sequence featuring the Nicholas Brothers who could dance better than just about anyone; and The Ink Spots shine whenever they are in front of the camera. James Newill sings, too--I loved it all! Charles Fuqua performs a ""song specialty;"" and The Wiere Brothers turn out a great performance, too. Look also for Mary Beth Hughes to play the secretary very well and Eula Morgan has a great cameo as opera singer Madame Rinaldi. Lucien Littlefield plays a Justice of the Peace.

The DVD also comes with extras including a featurette entitled ""Radio Waves: The Real History of The Great American Broadcast"" and a restoration comparison.

The Great American Broadcast is an essential film for fans of the actors in it and classic movie musicals. In addition, people who appreciate classic romantic comedies with song and dance thrown in for a great effect will not be disappointed.",1371513600,2,3206,4.746858168761221
