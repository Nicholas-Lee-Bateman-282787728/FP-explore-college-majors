4187449,5,B003RWSC5S,"The practice in this DVD is accessible, clearly presented, and beautifully shot. Focused for cyclists, it's also a gentle introduction to yogic practice, and a great warm-up for any athlete. I hope we'll see more instructional videos from this great teacher.",1279670400,2,258,5.317073170731708
4187450,5,B003RWSC5S,"Having practiced and taught yoga over the past ten years, I have to say that this DVD is far and away one of the best out there.  The series of poses is accessible to beginning yogis, but will keep even the most seasoned practitioners engaged, focused and present.  And, while the pre and post ride practices are 'targeted' for cyclists, it's by no means exclusive to those who ride.  I find the yoga poses presented beneficial both physically and for my overall well-being.  Great job in putting together a DVD that I can see myself watching and practicing over and over again.",1278288000,6,578,4.637254901960785
8403891,3,B003RWSC5S,"My only complaint about the program is I don't like the fast, ""flicking"" poses so I do them at my own pace. I haven't gotten on the bike much since I bought this DVD over a year ago but I have started practicing the sequences to prepare myself for a 40 mile hike in late May.

My main complaint is with the production of the DVD. As Sonyala mentioned above the 'play all' feature does not work so instead of viewing 4 segments seamlessly I have to select each chapter as the previous one finishes and the DVD returns to the menu. The music on the chapter menu pages is way to loud (=not relaxing) but if I mute the music and then select a chapter I lose the audio all together and have to go back to the chapter menu page and start all over again.",1396137600,,747,4.081632653061225
8403892,1,B003RWSC5S,"the whole thing skips  i tried other dvds just to make sure, but yours skips almost the whole way and then goes back to the beginning",1373414400,,133,4.115384615384615
8403893,1,B003RWSC5S,"This is a world away from an achievable yoga session! Too quick, and more like an expensive stretch out than Yoga, not that it has to be pure yoga to benefit, but this in my opinion is comical and you could get together with your mates and do better. If you ask me, get your hands on a copy of ""yoga for cyclists"" old but still totally relevant! this wheel of yoga can just roll off somewhere else.,......",1333584000,3,405,4.205128205128205
8403894,2,B003RWSC5S,"This video offers some basic stretches (few of which you'd do in a real yoga class). The video is spit into many short segments and the ""view all"" feature doesn't seem to work. So it is a very fragmented experience. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who wants to practice yoga or who wants anything other than very basic 3 to 5 minute stretching exercises.",1322870400,,359,4.538461538461538
8403895,5,B003RWSC5S,"I purchased this video looking for a calming routine to stretch tight muscles..
I love this!
It is slow paced and calming..",1314230400,,123,4.636363636363637
8403896,5,B003RWSC5S,"I thought I knew and had experienced a lot of riding miles and was somewhat accomplished in yoga, but David Moreno's video taught me in areas I had yet to consider--
Warming up to settling down afterwards....the cross-over dynamic from yoga to cycling hit me at a 'golden moment'.

After years on a bike, I am more conscious of posture, and thanks to David, even better for the motorcycle!

I feel more prepared, mentally and physically.",1291248000,3,437,4.7368421052631575
8403897,5,B003RWSC5S,"I have been doing yoga for years, but this was my first yoga DVD purchase. For the first time I wanted to start a home practice because I don't always have time to go to a class.  I checked out several videos in the process.  What I like about David Moreno's videos is that it's clear and easy to follow, David is engaging and I love the practice David has created.  I am a cyclist, but I often do the practices even when I'm not going for a ride.  I highly recommend ""Wheel of Yoga for Cyclists"".",1288224000,,497,4.092783505154639
8403898,5,B003RWSC5S,"I train exclusively for long distance endurance events and found significant benefits from the Pre Ride and Post ride techniques on the Wheel of Yoga DVD. It's easy to learn, did not over strain my body, and helped me recover from long days of running, cycling and swimming...""",1288224000,,277,4.791666666666667
8403899,2,B003RWSC5S,I bought the Wheel of Yoga DVD based on the good reviews. Was looking for stretches & positions that addressed a bugaboo of cyclists - forward position on the bike leading to forward shoulders in posture.  There is nothing on this DVD that addresses this! I was quite surprised & disappointed.,1287360000,6,293,4.745098039215686
8403900,5,B003RWSC5S,"I'm not a frequent cyclist, but am able to get out for a long ride every few weeks.  David's routines are a great way to make sure I'm in shape and limber, and recover well afterwards. Good bonus features, too!",1286755200,,210,4.25
