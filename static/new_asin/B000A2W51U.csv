8072701,4,B000A2W51U,"A young Australian actress, Sarah, plying her art with limited success in France, and an old Chinese man, Mr. Zao (whom James Hong depicts), who helps her with kindnesses, especially by cooking such delicious meals for her that her depression over her professional frustrations lessens somewhat, are the the two main characters in this quiet movie, along with her seductively handsome illicit lover, Phillippe. There is more display of exquisite sensibility than of outright action, which may cause this film to bore many viewers, but which entrances those who attune to its aesthetic to follow the fate of these characters with some intensity of interest in them.

Sarah lets her envy, over the actress playing the role for which she is an understudy, overwhelm her very interest in life itself. Being so young and exceedingly beautiful, as Leelee Sobieski portrays Sarah, she is, of course, foolish to be so impatient to succeed. She even sets an hex upon her actress rival which leads, as Sarah perceives things, to a terrible result.

Zao, in the meantime, is becoming ever more drawn to Sarah's beauty, despite that the wisdom of his aged years knows how futile it is to long for her. In fact, numerous men, alike young (Philippe, played by the very handsome Algerian-French actor Jalil Lespert) and old who include, besides Mr. Zao, also Roger, a lacivious, rather disgusting, stout man in later middle age (acted by Jean-Paul Rousillon), whose interest in her is purely and grossly carnal. As for Philippe, his own attraction to Sarah amounts mostly to a more youthful dose of lust, less off-putting because of this fornicating young married man's good looks in superb prime of life, but that, nonetheless, amounts to the same sordid interest in Sarah that Roger more distastefully displays!

A young lass, Caroline (her part taken by Marie Loboda), on the other hand, has developed a school-girl crush on Zao. This gives rise to some mischief done to the other protagonists in the drama.

The interactions of these various characters lead to some often ironic consequences. To go here into the details of all that would be to deprive any future viewer the pleasure of seeing for himself how all of this works out.

The movie, as mentioned, proceeds tranquilly, and, literally speaking, some of that is due to the sonically flat soundscape of the film when the viewer is not hearing any accompanying music in the background. When Gabriel Yared's quite lovely and charming music does occur now and then, the prevailing absence of it elsewhere makes its sudden presence intrude, albeit to agreeable effect, when the hearer becomes, inevitably and unavoidably, suddenly altogether too aware of it. The music, probably inadvertently, fits into the action more as incidental music in a play would occur prominently to what is on stage in the theatre, rather than in the way that music, when skillfully employed in a motion picture, enhances a well-made cinematic work's overall sound world (i.e., less intrusively than in the theatre, although, certaintly, the pleasure that incidental music affords in a staging offers its own more appropriately prominent delights). That, and the lighting, too, in ""L'Idole"" (""The Idol"") convey decidedly more, due to such factors, of what one encounters in a decently executed conceived-for-video or made-for-television production.

The English subtitles of ""L'Idole"", included in the French movie's DVD edition viewed (Seville Pictures 23145-DY), are easy to follow, since the action unfolds at such a leisurely pace. At least for Seville's DVD edition (not the same as the one for this Amazon entry), setting the DVD screen image aspect ratio at 4:3 gives better results than a more theatrical display ratio does, certainly enhancing the visual appeal of the actors taking the roles of Sarah, Philippe, and Zao among the movie's cast. In its own artistic, quietly understated way, this motion picture offers real pleasure for viewing at home as well as in the cinema house.",1419033600,,4013,5.109756097560975

8072703,1,B000A2W51U,"On the face, this film seems to promise a lot, but in practice it it is a monument to pretension and boredom. I really find no redeeming elements anywhere. The actors seem to be in a continuous state of catatonia. I have seen my share of slow but excellent movies, for example, ""Ma nuit chez Maude.""  Leelee Sobieski's outstanding scene is her vocal fake orgasm. I wonder whether she could do a bit of better acting, or the films she has made are consistently mediocre. Still waiting.  Don't get me wrong, she is, as usual, impressibly beautiful. James Hong is the ""inscrutable"" Chinese!  My, my, the director, Lang, should know better.  A better cinematography could have made this film more palatable.  I have seen better in soap operas.

In essence, it was a waste of my time and money.  Don't bother!",1269302400,2,804,4.659574468085107
8072704,5,B000A2W51U,"This movie is a really good example of French Art House. It is also a very interesting ""cross cultural"" subject because it involves a very traditional old Chinese within a French background and with an Australian woman!
There is something about this type of French movie that nobody else can make.  It is erotic without being pornographic. It is slightly seedy, and yet it is not. The characters are all faulty in some way or another, and the interaction is very dramatic. It is all held together by the inscrutable Chinaman, who speaks fluent French and is the glue to the entire piece.
It is probably not for everybody, because if you can't appreciate the characterisations and the underlying meaning of all that is going on, then the apparent slow pace might seem boring.  I have watched it 5 times now, and i get something more from it each time.",1255737600,3,850,4.66

Sarah (LeeLee Sobieski), an aspiring young actree from Australia moves into an upscale apartment building in France. When a brief but emotionally charged relationship fails and she loses the lead role in a play Sarah falls into a sucidal depression. Unable to function or complete the most elementary of daily tasks, she lays prostrate on her bed neglecting both hygiene and nourishment.

Fortunately an elderly Chinese neighbor (James Hong) observes her plight through an open door and decides to care for her. Taking on the chores of cooking and cleaning he nurses her back to health. Before long a tenious bond of friendship and mutual fascination forms between them.

The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow and for those who watch it to the conclusion are bond to wonder why they even bothered. For those who want to see LeeLee Sobieski topless I guess this is the movie for you. Or if you're a manic depressive who appreciates slow, somber studies in self-loathing and psychological isolation, ENJOY!",1197417600,17,1060,5.045714285714285
