8442270,5,B004UV3KSY,The A-team dvd is good but the some of the show were not that good the one with Hulk Hogan was good and the pilot was good I think they could have picked some other ones,1472169600,,169,3.7222222222222223
8442271,5,B004UV3KSY,"Quality product, no problems with any of the disca at all.",1420329600,,58,4.363636363636363
8442272,5,B004UV3KSY,the A-team is a great tv show from 80s and the  dvd is great to watch,1407024000,,69,3.3125
8442273,5,B004UV3KSY,I would recommend this DVD.  Need to look in my movie library to see what I have.  I plan to order additional seasons of the A-Team. The price was good too.,1391817600,,156,4.0
8442274,4,B004UV3KSY,"I am not sure if I agree that the episodes chosen are the best of the A-Team. Firtly, to remain consistent with the best of 80s series, The pilot and the final episodes are included on this set. The pilot is listed as a 2 part episode when in fact it runs as 1 double length episode. Unlike the others in the Best of series, the pilots for Magnum P.I. and Knight Rider are presented in their 2 part syndicated format whereas the pilot for A-Team had to be presented as a single episode because in the syndicated run, when shown in 2 parts, they played the series intro with Dirk Benedict in it which was misleading as he did not join the cast until the 2nd episode of the series. Still it would have been nice to have the 2 part version as they could have easily created an opening w/o Dirk or just left it in. The other 2 part episodes which should have made this compilation include, Bend in the River, When You Coming Back Range Rider? and Judgement Day as the 2 hour episodes were better than the 1 hour eps of any season as they allowed for the story to develop rather than wrap it up in a 48 minute show. Even the 3 part story arc of season 5, though titled as 3 separate episodes could have been included. I just hope Universal goes back to the 70s and does the same for shows like BSG and Buck so that maybe we can finally see the original pilot episode of Buck Rogers and not the movie that was put in place of the pilot on the series disc.",1309910400,2,1449,4.105633802816901
8442275,3,B004UV3KSY,"Not to confuse this series with great television, this 2 disc set does offer a fine overview of one of the more entertaining entries of the 80's tv series. Episodes from the five seasons here are a fun reminder of what a comic book style adventure the show was like ""Breakout"" and ""Pros and Cons"". Also we get the cheerfully ridiculous Magnificent Seven-like (the pilot) two parter ""Mexican Slayride"", the memorably silly ""Body Slam"" with Hulk Hogan and the fairly dramatic ""Sound of Thunder"". Perfect for anyone who wouldn't buy a full season's worth of the show but are curious to rewatch a few of the more finely tuned episodes of the enjoyable series.",1309651200,2,655,4.754385964912281
8442276,2,B004UV3KSY,the pilot was never a favorite of mine since dirk benedict was not in it. another actor played face-man but was let go since he looked to young to be a vietnam veteran. one of the best two parters The bend in the river is not included. barry van dyke was the guest star[van dyke was in galactica 1980] while dirk benedict made a guest appearance and was scheduled to return if the show was not cancelled.,1308787200,,404,4.259740259740259
8442277,3,B004UV3KSY,"Not here to write a review, just to give a list of some of the episodes included in this set. I just glanced at the DVDs at the store so I can't remember all of the episodes, but here is a list of most of them.
