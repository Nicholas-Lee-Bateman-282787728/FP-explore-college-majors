870611,5,6304429703,"~This movie is far more than Western macho dudes strutting around looking for the man who shot his pa. It begins with Clint getting hung by a gang for allegedly stealing cattle. Someone saves him, and then we see the complications of revenge and justice, and how easily one can slip from the latter into blood lust. Clint gets a job as a top lawman, and is assigned to arrest those very men who tried lynching him. Naturally, he can have nothing but doubts about anyone he meets, as Oklahoma law in~~ its pre-state status is nearly non existant. Here he becomes very much a D'Argtanian type figure, where prowess and toughness correspond directly to law, order, and loyalty to the public good. Yet, all the while, the viewer and the characters themselves have doubts about their deeds and the potentially grave consequences of being involved in maintaining social order -not to mention if they fail at their jobs. In the end, we get an entertaining piece with great acting, and a thought provoking~~~~ protrayal of whether law can transcend the gutters of violence and establish true justice.~~~",997833600,,1095,4.829787234042553
870612,3,6304429703,"In this film, Clint Eastwood plays a rancher who unknowingly buys stolen livestock. Soon, he meets up with those who knew the real owner, and is  given a dose of lynch mob justice. Out of town and out in the country, they  throw a rope over a tree limb and hang the innocent rancher. Once they  leave, a sheriff happens by and discovers him swinging in the air. He stops  and saves his life, but not knowing why he was hanged, the sheriff takes  him to the local jail. Before long, the wronged rancher is wearing a star  of his own and rides out looking for the men who hanged him. Only  difference is he is ordered to try and bring the men into justice legally.  This picture is lined with an all-star cast including Dennis Hopper, Bruce  Dern, and Alan Hale Jr.,.",966211200,2,765,4.293706293706293
870613,4,6304429703,"After earning major stardom with Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy, Clint Eastwood turned down both Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and Carl Foreman's ""MacKenna's Gold"" to star in and co-produce this tightly scripted, well-acted western directed by ""Gunsmoke"" veteran Ted Post. It proved a good choice. If not a masterpiece on the order of Leone's film, or a star studded spectacular like Foreman's offering, ""Hang 'Em High"" was something the other two were not: a hit. It's also intelligent and makes some interesting if subtle comments on the meaning of justice. The clean-shaven Eastwood is fine as Jed Cooper, a former marshal who once more wears a badge to hunt down the men who hanged him as an alleged cattle thief, but Pat Hingle as a hanging judge who is even more vengeance minded than Eastwood offers the standout performance. Bruce Dern, Bob Steele, Ben Johnson, Joe Sirola, Dennis Hopper, and Alan Hale, Jr. (yes, the Skipper from ""Gilligan's Island"") are among the notable character actors who appear throughout, and Dominic Frontiere's music score, including the title theme that would go on to be a hit for Booker T and the MGs, is excellent.",962236800,,1172,4.9543147208121825
870614,5,6304429703,"Being a true blue western fan, I find this movie great since it has the elements of style found in the TV westerns and the old westerns of Wayne, Stewart and Fonda. The Sergio Leone spaghettis leave a bad taste in the  mouth from the cheapie ""For a Few Dollars More"" to the expansive  and expensive ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.""  ""Once Upon  a Time in the West"" was bad but could've been more palatable with  Eastwood in it. Although some residue of spaghetti sauce is present in  ""Hang 'Em High"", overall the movie is great. While the ending is  a bit tepid and where probably a wild and wooly shoot 'em up finale would  have been better, Clint nevertheless made this one a true Western classic.  Clint is great in this one. I recoomend this to all Western fans as it is  one of the latter date westerns that capture the essence of the golden age  westerns.",953856000,3,863,4.33125

For ex. the volume had to be turned way up to hear the voices but  when the music came in it blew you out! I'm goint to give the blame to MGM  for that because I have ""The Searchers"" on DVD, which is a much  older movie, and the picture and sound is much better. As for the story  itself, the movie ends unfinished. What about the girl, or the rest of the  bad guys? Watch and you'll see for yourself.

870839,5,6304429703,"Eastwood's role here (Cooper) is similar to his Dirty Harry persona, except Cooper is a bit more ""human"" if you get what I mean. I did enjoy the philosophical/ethical verbal sparring between Cooper & the judge during the film--it's very important. Cooper was in the wrong place @ the wrong time & when the vigilantes had a chance to let him make his case before ""the law"" they instead chose to dispose of him.

But they didn't get the job done & in typical Eastwood fashion, they are pursued relentlessly by the man they wronged. Cooper learns to respect ""the law."" Well, maybe not ""the Law"" per se, but what ""is right & honorable""--even if it doesn't square with what is written in the statutes. Bruce Dern is a fantastic villain in this too. Great movie, even when bullets aren't flying to-and-fro. That's why it's still a great movie almost a half-century later.",1507334400,,865,4.65359477124183

870931,4,6304429703,"Released in 1968 and directed by Ted Post, Hang em High stars Clint Eastwood as a man unjustly lynched by a posse bent on justice after a crime, but he survives and becomes a marshal in order to track the culprits.

This is essentially the Batman story set in the Old West with Pat Hingle in the Commissioner Gordon role, which is ironic since he went on to play that very role in the four Batman films from 1989-1997. Inger Stevens plays the potential babe; unfortunately Inger committed suicide less than two years after the release of the movie. Arlene Golonka is also on hand. Speaking of additional actors, the movie features several familiar faces, including Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, Alan Hale Jr., Ed Begley, Dennis Hopper and LQ Jones.

While this is an American production, the producers spiced it with Spaghetti Western elements since that sub-genre was at the height of its popularity after Sergio Leones so-called Man With No Name trilogy from 1964-1966. For instance, Dominic Frontiere composed the Morricone-ish score.

Its great seeing Clint when he was so young, 37 during filming. He was riding a wave of popularity after the success of the Man With No Name flicks and was well in the process of taking the torch from John Wayne as The Western icon. While Hang em High may not be great like The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), its a very good Western, about on par with Pale Rider (1985).

The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in New Mexico & Arizona with studio work done in Culver City, California. The script was written by Leonard Freeman & Mel Goldberg.

The judge knows him.  And deputizes him to go and find the men who lynched him.
There is a great scene when he captures Bruce Dern.  They go back and forth with each other.  And Dern tells him ""You'll Never Get Me Back To Ft. Smith Alive Boy.""  to Which Eastwood replies.  Then I'll Get You There Dead Boy.""  I love that.",1492992000,,672,4.32258064516129

I want to rate it close to five stars but can't because I felt the judge's character was a bit inconsistent in his idea of justice and because of what I wrote below (see my spoiler comment).

James McArthur (Danny Williams from ""FIVE-O"") also co-stars as ""the Preacher"",while the female lead,the late,talented Inger Stevens,plays ""Rachael"",a woman,seeking personal revenge from a violent rape,who is allowed to visit the jail,to identify her attackers. she and Cooper eventually form a somewhat brief relationship,but Cooper is still on the trail for the men who lynched him-he tries to arrest the first lyncher,played by Joseph Sirola,who he shoots dead in an attempted gunfight,and  he arrests another,played by ""GILLIGAN'S ISLAND"" regular Alan Hale,Jr. but he later travels at great lengths to capture the other man,played by Bruce Dern,who he eventually captures and arrests,after a lengthy horse ride through a long desert with his detainees. the movie almost plays out like something you'd watch on Eastwood's ""RAWHIDE"" TV series,but it reaches a dramatic climax after the judge convinces Cooper to keep that Marshal badge.to hunt down the other two men involved with his unjust lynching. and while the music of Ennio Morricone wasn't used in this movie, the outstanding scores of composer Dominic Frontiere were used,and it was actually quite good! Frontiere is mostly a TV music composer back in his day,but among his many impressive credentials,was his otherworldly score he created for ABC-TV's ""THE OUTER LIMITS"" in Fall 1963. Frontiere also did the themes to other TV classics like ""THE FLYING NUN"",""THE RAT PATROL"",""STONEY BURKE"",""TWELVE O' CLOCK HIGH"" and ""SEARCH"" among his huge resume of movie and TV music- but ""HANG EM' HIGH"" was still one of Dominic Frontiere's finest works,although its far from an Ennio Morricone score,it still holds its own very well! sometime during the movie's release,the soundtrack to ""HANG EM' HIGH"" was also released,liked by United Artists' then record label,and later re-released through MCA records. the so called original soundtrack to this movie,was not an actual or accurate soundtrack,as Frontiere likely was asked to try redoing his music score,the actual soundtrack on the film was still better! in general,this is indeed a worthy movie,worth being part of the Clint Eastwood movie collection,for serious fans of his theatrical westerns.",1476748800,,3667,5.50177304964539

I don't think this looks any better than the DVD I use to have. Anyway, the redhead harlot in the film is not too hard on the eyes and seeing a very well staffed gathering of some great actors makes this film very enjoyable.

But, perhaps on a smaller TV screen, because the picture is rather blurry although the print on the screen looks pretty sharp.  Go figure.

Anyway, I paid about 5 dollars for this blu-ray about a year ago. So, I'm glad this less-than-wonderfully mastered film sold for a price reasonably worthy of all its shortcomings.",1451347200,,702,4.5476190476190474

Frankly, I don't understand why the TV rating system only gave this film two stars. I think it is so good it deserves five stars. I note that despite giving the film only two stars the TV stations think their viewers enjoy the film so much that they repeat showing it often. It seems that viewers can find an Eastwood film on TV whenever they want to see it again. This obviously shows that the TV stations recognize that people want to see it. If people want to see it so often doesn't it deserve more than two stars?",1437523200,,661,4.171875

872502,5,6304429703,"Hang 'Em High (1968) was Clint Eastwood's first American western, coming on the heels of his Man With No Name trilogy of spaghetti westerns A Fistful Of Dollars (1964), For A Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966).  Those were all great iconic Italian-made westerns, but Hang 'Em High is great in its own right.  This time Eastwood's character has a name.  Without giving too much away, this movie is basically about a man who is hung due to a mistake in identity, and he survives and becomes a deputy and hunts down the men who tried to kill him via hanging.  Other notable actors also appearing in this movie are Pat Hingle, Bruce Dern, and Dennis Hopper.  The acting is very good throughout, especially by Pat Hingle.  The musical score is pretty good, a little bombastic, but not overdone.  This movie has all the visual elements of a typical western, but the story is the strongest aspect of the movie.  The camerawork and cinematography are both great.

I feel this is a very underrated Clint Eastwood western.  It isn't quite in the same caliber (no pun intended) as movies like Unforgiven, High Plains Drifter, and The Outlaw Josie Wales, but it comes VERY VERY close to being of the same caliber.  I do, however, give it the same rating that I give the above mentioned movies - 5 stars.",1418428800,2,1324,4.567796610169491

Clint eventual catches up with those men who falsely tried to hang him.  Most of them end up dead.  A good late afternoon or evening flick to watch',1416096000,,474,4.363636363636363

872656,4,6304429703,"After Clint Eastwood concluded his ""Man With No Name"" trilogy in Italy, he returned to Hollywood a movie star.  His first U. S. film was another Western, but one with more dialog and an underlying theme (capital punishment).

Eastwood plays a former lawman named Jed Cooper who is now trying to set himself up in Oklahoma as a rancher.  Having bought a herd of cattle he is moving them to his ranch when he is confronted by 9 men on the prairie.  Led by Captain Wilson (Ed Begley), Cooper is accused of murdering the man who allegedly sold him the cattle.  Even with a bill of sale, he's strung up and left for dead.  Minutes later Cooper is rescued from the noose by Marshal Bliss (Ben Johnson), who is in the process of transferring a half dozen prisoners back to the territorial capital.  Bliss tosses Cooper in with the others.

Cooper is eventually cleared of wrong doing by the territories' hanging Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle).  Fenton offers Cooper a job as marshal with the condition that he actually bring back the bad guys to be hanged rather than shooting them himself.  He agrees and sets out to find the 9 men who took the law into their own hands.

Eastwood's Cooper isn't the same character as the one he played so well in Leone's spaghetti westerns.  He's a bit more polished and not quite as vengeful.  Yet he does have a mean streak and is just as resilient.  Inger Stevens, who would die just a couple years later at age 35, gives a wooden performance as Rachel Warren, a love interest of Cooper's.  She checks out all the men brought to prison hoping to find the 2 men who killed her husband and raped her...I mean had their way with her.  She is generally repelled by men as a result and is slow to accept Cooper's modest advances.  That all changes after Cooper is gunned down by Wilson and 2 of his henchmen and she nurses him back to health.

There is some interesting byplay between Cooper and Judge Fenton when Cooper questions the rationale for bringing men back for trial, only to be hung.  Fenton explains that hanging them proves to the citizenry that justice is just as swift and conclusive as taking the law into their own hands.  In fact, the executions are a big event for the folks in the territory.  People gather from miles around to enjoy the carnival-like atmosphere of a public hanging.

Ardent movie watchers will also spot Bruce Dern as one of the gang that hangs Cooper, along with long-time western actor Bob Steele and a brief cameo by Dennis Hopper.  Eastwood gives an excellent performance.  Director Ted Post keeps the camera close on Eastwood's face in numerous scenes, provided an opportunity for some nuanced reactions.  While ""Hang `em High"" isn't Eastwood's best movie or even best performance, it is a nice stepping stone for his long career and certainly worth a look.

The Blu ray transfer is a big upgrade from the DVD.  It maintains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and comes in 1080p resolution.  Although this isn't a frame-by-frame restoration it still looks very good.  Colors and skin tones appear authentic.  Black levels are good as is the detail.  The only abnormality I noticed come with a couple scene changes where the color intensity is inconsistent.  No biggie.  The audio redirects the original mono sound into 5.1 courtesy of DTS-HD Master Audio.  There are limits of course but the lossless track provides good reproduction of the film's musical score.  Surrounds come into play mostly with the large crowd scenes and during the gun battles.  If you are a purist, a mono Dolby Digital 2.0 option is available.  Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.  The disc is devoid of extras.",1409961600,7,3665,4.66875

Was spotty and rough in quite a few spots. If you already own it on DVD,  I wouldn't bother picking it up on bluray unless they remaster it.

872732,1,6304429703,"I should have known from the price it was too good to be true. Little by little I have been replacing my dvd collection with, hopefully, better quality blu-rays. You, sometimes, get pleasantly surprised by the quality of some of these older movies. This is not one of those times. I found this not to be any better than the dvd I've owned for years. This blu-ray has all the grit, grains and scratches that would rival any good ol' VHS. The only difference I noticed is that it was slightly brighter. On the back of the blu-ray case it says, and I quote.... THE ULTIMATE HIGH-DEFINITION EXPERIENCE.......  Lies, all lies.

To some it up, Hang' Em High is a great Clint Eastwood movie, but if you own the dvd or even VHS don't bother with this movie. Wait until it gets the Restoration treatment his other westerns got like Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven or the Good, Bad and Ugly. I think I big key to buying these movies on blu-ray is that if it only has the movie and no special features, chances are they didn't put any time into the disc.

But is is fun to watch and if you appreciate the genre, you will probably like it. I would not rate it as a classic western, but none the less a very good one.

Clint plays a wanderer who is mistaken for a rustler and hung by a group of vigilantes. By chance a passing deputy US marshal saves him and brings him before a judge. The judge eventually decides he is no rustler and offers him a deputy marshal position.

Clint uses his position to chase and kill off those who hung him.",1396051200,,635,4.275

In this one, the bad guys aren't so bad, a mix of regular citizens along with a few rough wild west-types who did a very bad thing when they hanged Clint Eastwood without a trial (although it turns out they had every reason to be angry with him...if he actually was guilty.)  As a vote against capital punishment the movie also portrays two handsome, nice, blue-eyed blonde boys who admittedly stole some cattle and were thrown under the bus by their partner in crime, the one real bad guy (Bruce Dern) who murdered the people who owned the cows that got Clint hung in the first place.  But under Clint's objections, the Judge hanged the nice boys anyway. Clint was so angry he grabbed a prostitute and took out his anger on her.  She was so mad at him for making her miss the hanging that she smoked a cigarette and glared at him. In short, if you like a little gray mixed in with your stereotypical bad guy/good guy Western and your expectations aren't too high, I recommend this.",1393459200,3,1170,4.63768115942029

The same artifacts, color fading and even some ugly splicing-- particularly noticeable in the first reel-- that plagued previous releases appear and re-appear at those odd, familiar moments throughout.  On the positive side, and on balance, it's still a treat watching HEH in hi-def.  The expansive, sunwashed New Mexico exteriors are crisper and brighter than ever, and the audio is crystal clear.

873067,4,6304429703,"... completely eliminated Inger Stevens' useless role which dragged the film into ""high-snooze"" mode whenever she appeared. Vengence and retribution get pushed aside for a smoochie country picnic and some needless love interest. Somebody must have thought Clint needed a girl friend after finishing up the Leone trilogy. Wish L.Q. would have returned to finish up his earlier botched assassination attempt during this picnic sequence. Besides, this romantic interlude brought the film to a deadly halt with an impact equal of Reno getting blasted in the saloon, though not nearly as rewarding or as satisfying.

Now I've got nothing against women (in general) in Westerns. Women often add much to the overall story, like splashing around in a wine vat in THE WILD BUNCH. But Inger's scenes here are a complete waste. I repeat, this would have been a far better Western had they cut her obligatory love-interest role and spent the time far more wisely by having Clint track down the last two guys instead. Whether he brought them back dead or alive, no matter. It certainly would have made more interesting viewing.

As the wronged cowboy who becomes a deputy in the service of no-nonsense judge Pat Hingle and brings justice to those who done him wrong, Clint is just perfect in the role. The filmic aspects are fairly typical but the play of characters and their backdrop are satisfying and well done. Clint is less squinty and terse here than he is in the spaghetti westerns too. I always like the philosophy prevalent in Westerns: the goodie is really good, the baddie is unremittingly bad, and eventually the goodie triumphs in a fatal showdown.

873310,4,6304429703,"""Hang 'Em High"" (1968) is directed by Ted Post (Magnum Force, The Harrad Experiment, Beneath the Panet of the Apes). Clint Eastwood stars as Jed Cooper, a man who is lynched by a gang even though he was innocent of the accusations of murder and cattle rustling. When Jed manages to survive the hanging and is subsequently freed of any crimes he enlists as a US Marshal and hunts down the gang that lynched him. The film itself  pits Jed's moral views of justice and fairness against the backdrop of the harsh morality as served by Judge Adam Fenton (Pat HIngle) at Fort Grant.
The film entertains us even as it tells us a story about courage and varying opinions about morality.

The blu-ray has not been remastered, and has many instances of dust. Also, the clarity of the images are not much better than a dvd, and sometimes the color is off and lacks saturation, but overall the film is quite watchable.",1309132800,22,906,4.552147239263804

873316,5,6304429703,"What ever happened to western movies? They used to be a dime a dozen. There were shoot-em-ups, fist fights and singing cowboys. There were the white hats and the black hats and the white hats always prevailed. I must have watched hundreds of them during my youth in the late 40s and early 50s. Then westerns got much more serious and gradually faded out until nowadays you hardly ever seem to see one. Alas, I rather enjoyed western movies, especially some of the more serious ones of the 60s and 70s. Well, many are still available on DVD and I bought up a batch featuring Clint Eastwood. I'd previously seen a few of his movies and enjoyed them.

Last night my wife and I watched ""Hang 'em High."" The movie was true to it's title. I've never seen so many hangings in one movie! Multiple hangings were a regular small-town public spectacle attended by festive audiences of hundreds of people. Even teenagers (16 and 18, in one instance) were hanged! And for what? Well murder could get you hanged, that was for certain.  Even stealing horses or cattle could also turn the trick. And if you didn't get hanged by the law, then bands of concerned self-appointed lawmen might do the job without such formalities as a trial. Such was the case in the wild-west Oklahoma Territory in the mid-1800s and Clint Eastwood was hanged for stealing cattle he had actually paid for. Fortunately, the Hangers botched the job and he was cut loose, cleared of the charges and turned into a deputy who's main task was to track down those nine men who had attempted to hang him. Of course, he gets the job done, Clint Eastwood style.

""Hang 'em High"" is a very good movie, if you can stand all the hangings and other assorted violence. Well, it's fiction, isn't it? In any case, we enjoyed watching the movie. It was well done, if not somewhat excessively violent, entertainment. But then, that's what most western movies were all about, weren't they?

At the very minimum please remove the dust particles from the print. Also, as an older film I understand that there will be grain but c'mon: many scenes looked like it was snowing black snowflakes. The fact that some of the outdoor scenes were a marginable improvement over the DVD keeps this from receiving a bottom-barrel one star.

873358,5,6304429703,"Hang 'Em High was the first Hollywood film that Clint Eastwood starred in as the leading man.  It followed up his three, ""Spaghetti Westerns,"" made with Sergio Leone, and the style of those films is adapted somewhat to the more traditional Hollywood Western style.  You could call this one a bit of a hybrid between those two styles.

The script is excellent, the cast is fantastic, and the direction is solid.  This is a great Western.

The Blu Ray is very good.  The DVD was a bit disappointing with colors that smeared a little, lots of print damage and dust, and a picture that wasn't very crisp and clear.  The Blu Ray, on the other hand, has very little of that print damage remaining.  The colors are sharp and don't bleed.  The picture is significantly crisper and cleaner.  The improvement is easily noticeable when compared back to back.

If you like Clint Eastwood or Westerns (and especially if you like both), then this movie is highly recommended.  (And the Blu Ray comes with the DVD as a bonus in case you want to watch it in a room where you don't have a Blu Ray player yet.)",1275696000,11,1092,4.4873096446700504
873359,3,6304429703,"Okay, I get it. (Sort of.) HANG 'EM HIGH was Clint Eastwood's first ""American"" western. HANG 'EM HIGH launched Eastwood into iconic superstar status. (Though how this film could be that vehicle vexes me.) Moving forward, Eastwood would make a plethora of Hollywood films that set box office records, making HANG 'EM HIGH quite the metaphorical springboard. (Just try using ""metaphorical springboard"" in a review of a Western, I dare ya.) I could go on and on (but mercifully will not), but suffice it to say despite the positives this film did for Eastwood's career HANG 'EM HIGH is melodramatic, overdone sophistry. It's mediocrity run amuck.

Does it have its moments? Of course. With star power like Eastwood, Pat Hingle, Ed Begley, Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, and L.Q. Jones, this movie is bound to have its grand Western moments. Yet it also runs too long, Eastwood's character is up and down like a yo-yo, co-star Inger Stevens is more wooden than a department store mannequin, the subsequent hangings (there are alot of them, folks) are just silly, and poor Dennis Hopper makes a brief appearance that's a howler (quite the flopping death). Yes, it's a story of misguided justice, and vengeance--but it's also contrived, melodramatic, and takes forever to get to its (predictable) ending.

Other than that, no problemo.

What struck me is the subsequent tragedy of two actresses in two films Eastwood made at this time. Both Stevens and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-Seberg/dp/B00003CXBX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean Seberg</a>&nbsp;would go on to commit disturbing suicides.

Is it enough to get a man to risk his life until the rest of his life in order to finalize his evenge? In real life one hopefully would give up. Eventhough he was almost hanged. There were some loose ends in the story. Perhaps this was meant to be so. Inger Stevens is looking men who rape her, but does not find them.

I don't believe this film got big play by the critics on initial release probably because they were late comers to the Sergio Leone trilogy.  Taken in context with the trajectory that Clint Eastwood's career has taken it's very consistent with themes explored in his latter works.  Here frontier justice, vigilanteism, and the death penalty are examined.  Eastwood plays an innocent rancher who is hung for murder by a bloodthirsty posse.  Rescued by the sheriff from certain death he is given a chance to avenge his hanging by a sympathetic judge by deputizing him and telling him to bring his tormentors in alive.  Eastwood's Jeb Cooper is not the shoot-and-ask-questions-later Man With No Name of the Leone films.  He has a certain ambivalence about his task at hand and he feels conflicted about what he has to do.  Though not on the level of the Leone films there's an interesting director at the helm in Ted Post.  Post directed Eastwood in ""Magnum Force"" that explored the vigilante theme and later ""Go Tell the Spartans"" with Burt Lancaster about the early days of the Vietnam conflict.  There's a certain obscurity to ""Hang 'Em High"" but should be viewed in context of the Eastwood canon of impressive work.",1261699200,3,1376,4.812765957446809

The Western genre is inextricably linked to the nature of justice and in this regard Hang 'Em High, the story of a wrongfully-lynched man who survives and seeks to avenge the crime of his hanging, is a complete success; however, in terms of sheer enjoyment it falls considerably behind movies like The Good the Bad and the Ugly or The Outlaw Josey Wales, so if you don't dig the justice themes and just want more action look elsewhere.

873433,3,6304429703,"Following the huge success of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, Clint Eastwood returned to the States  and made a western that is almost an American spaghetti western.  Jed Cooper is driving his newly bought cattle herd home when a nine-man posse stops him, saying he stole the cattle and killed the owner.  Without a second thought, they string Cooper up on a nearby tree without making sure he's actually dead. A marshal happens to be riding by and cuts him down.  After the truth is discovered, Cooper is let free where he takes a job as a marshal and starts to hunt the men down responsible for the failed lynching.  The plot is pretty then as Cooper also deals with other crooks, not to mention some confrontations with a power hungry judge.  There's some good action throughout, and the style in general is similar to Leone's westerns. Because of the similarities, Hang 'Em High doesn't quite live up to expectations, but it's still worth a watch for western fans.

 In a role similar to the Man with No Name, Eastwood is Jed Cooper, a man with a taste for revenge after he's wrongfully accused of cattle rustling and murder, then left to hang.  Eastwood at his best here, a man on a mission who will stop at nothing to get the job done. Inger Stevens is the love interest, Rachel Warren, a woman searching for her husband's killers who raped her. Ed Begley plays Captain Wilson, the leader of the posse who hangs Cooper, but upon realizing he's still alive much later becomes terrified of being hunted down.  Pat Hingle is a good counterpart to Eastwood as Judge Fenton, a power-hungry judge trying to bring frontier justice to the Oklahoma territory.  Ben Johnson and Charles McGraw also make memorable appearances as two sheriffs Cooper encounters.  The posse includes Bruce Dern, Alan Hale JR, L.Q. Jones, Joe Sirola, and Bob Steele.  As good a cast as the movie boasts, there are so many good characters that many aren't dealt with or developed enough.

 The DVD is a good buy at just under $10.  The widescreen presentation is a little grainy but very watchable.

The score alone is enought to make me gag; it could have been written for some cheesy made-for-TV movie or even one of the later Gunsmoke episodes.  Clint does a decent enough job but doesn't look nearly as tough without a beard.  The script is predictable and just doesn't have any air of mystery about it like Eastwood's previous work.

873437,4,6304429703,"After a few years as Rowdy Yates in the TV series ""Rawhide"", Clint Eastwood managed to attain international superstardom via the trilogy of wacky, violent Italian spaghetti westerns he made with director Sergio Leone in the mid-1960s.  And then in 1968, he returned to America to make his own homegrown sagebrush impact.  The end result was HANG 'EM HIGH, a significant box office hit upon its release in the late summer of 1968.

Here, Eastwood portrays a former lawman on a cattle drive through the barren Oklahoma Territory who is set upon by a gang of rustlers, led by Ed Begley, who proceed to string him up for getting those cattle from a ranching family they claim he had murdered.  But there are two problems with that: Eastwood wasn't the culprit in those murders; and when they string him up, they don't finish the job.  Saved from certain death by a local marshal (Ben Johnson, always that most credible of Western actors), he is then made a federal marshal by the territorial judge (Pat Hingle) and assigned the task of getting the rustlers who tried to kill him, but turning them in alive, so Hingle can try them and then hang 'em--and hang 'em high!

Eastwood's thirst for vengeance does not make him a remorseless killing machine, however, since he comes to question Hingle's brand of ""justice"", and especially after having a fire lit under him by a woman (Inger Stevens) who also wants revenge for her ex-husband having been murdered, possibly by Begley's crew (including Bruce Dern and L.Q. Jones).  He happens to show a lot of mercy to an old man (Bob Steele) who had originally been part of Begley's lynching crew because Steele had warned Begley that they hung an innocent man.

All of this makes HANG 'EM HIGH stand out.  More than a few critics groused upon its release that this movie was merely made to cash in on the Eastwood/Leone films, which racked up big box office in America in 1967.  But while there is some of Leone's influence here, HANG 'EM HIGH is not as wacky or violent as those films were.  It is a complex and quite thought-provoking meditation on the idea of frontier justice.  Contrary to the notion of Eastwood being every bit as staunch a Hollywood conservative as John Wayne, HANG 'EM HIGH shows us, as did Leone, and as Sam Peckinpah would, that the demarcation between good and evil, and right and wrong, is an often thin line that is often crossed.

Ted Post, who had directed Eastwood in a few ""Rawhide"" episodes and made his feature-film directing debut here, sometimes slips in his overuse of the zoom lens and Leone-inspired closeups for certain shock effects (notably the hanging sequences, of which there are plenty, but none shown in ultra-graphic detail).  But he does give Eastwood a lot to work with, via the screenplay by producer Leonard Freeman (who later created ""Hawaii Five-O""), and Mel Goldberg.  Hingle makes for a very cagey judge; and Dern and Jones do the villain parts to a tee.  Also featured here are Alan Hale Jr. (much more menacing than his ""Skipper"" role in ""Gilligan's Island"" will have you believe), Charles McGraw, Arlene Golonka, and, in a brief but typically flamboyant bit part as a sagebrush religious psychotic, Dennis Hopper.

Featuring a good score by Dominic Frontiere (whose main theme would be popularized by Booker T and the MGs later in '68), and shot on location in New Mexico, HANG 'EM HIGH is one of the most underrated films of the Western genre from the 1960s, and marked Eastwood as a very efficient ""star"", on the verge of becoming one heck of an actor and director to boot as well.",1203033600,3,3580,4.7024

873489,5,6304429703,"Clint Eastwood's 1967 debut in an American western after successfully starring in Sergio Leone's internationally reknown trilogy of westerns that made him a star.

The screenplay is a more sober portrayal of the western genre without the surreal motifs portrayed by Leone.  The film follows Eastwood's character who was wrongly accused of being a cattle rustler and lynched by mob of thugs.  Out for revenge, Eastwood nevertheless wants to do it by the law and is deputized as a marshall by a judge who needs new necks to hang from his gallows to give his town the semblance of order.  Accepting the assignment, Eastwood's character tracks down his past attackers one by one.  Eastwood's character also seeks the affections of a woman who seeks revenge against those who raped her and murdered her husband.

This is a good western in which the characters and their motivations are well developed.  As one reviewer mentioned, this film explores the concepts of personal vs. collective retribution against past wrongs and the personal conflicts they entail.  The story explores the notions of what is crime and what is proper punishment.  It explores how barbarism and lawlessness are treated where legal instututions are lacking and span as far as the boundaries of a small frontier town.  It looks at how rampant crime and the absence of law generate both a sense of injustice and an overzealous desire for retribution.  The film also explores the consequences of crimes committed by groups in which the perpetrators differ by intent and degree in their participation.  Who is really more to blame?  The only down side to this film is that the ending is somewhat abrupt and rather empty in light of the climax of the story.  Otherwise, this is a good film worth owning or renting.",1174003200,,1780,4.929530201342282

873492,5,6304429703,"An innocent cowboy is quickly tried and summarily lynched when a cattle baron and his cohorts find him in possession of stolen cattle.

 All this happens before the opening title begins to roll, and since the innocent getting strung up is Clint Eastwood you know it'll either be a botched hanging or we're in store for a weird flashback, a la Ambrose Bierce's `An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.'  The lynch mob is led by Ed Begley, and contains a number of familiar faces, including Alan Hale, Jr. and Bruce Dern.  Clint's dangle is abruptly terminated when passing US Marshal Ben Johnson cuts him down and dumps him into what looks like a prairie paddy wagon.  The wagon is traveling to the town that houses the only law for 20,000 square miles - or something like that.  Judge Pat Hingle awaits, and he goes on a bit about the vast area, the limited resources, and the need to establish law and civilize the land.  What the judge needs is a marshal who can help him pave the way for civilized society.

 It seems that in the best of Eastwood's movies he dies, or has a near death experience, and is reborn as a sneering agent of vengeance.  Reborn or merely indestructible, it's a neat way to build an icon and, somehow, allows the movie to ask big questions.  The big one in this, of course, is how far do we travel in our pursuit of justice?  Is personal vengeance more important that societal justice?

 The five stars I gave HANG `EM HIGH should be taken with a grain of salt and a caveat of emptor.  I don't think it's a very good movie.  Inger Stevens plays a widow lady who's on her own journey of retribution and, as usual with her back then, is under-used.  Director Ted Post spent most of his career directing television programs, including episodes of the Eastwood-starring ""Rawhide,"" and the movie has a pretty lumpy pace.  The lumpiest scene occurs near the end of the movie, that time most plots would (and should) be racing to the finish line.  That last act contains an unforgivably long scene with James ""Book'em, Dan-O"" MacArthur as a preacher saying service over a number of condemned men on the scaffold.  If there was a point to that scene it was lost on me - didn't advance the plot, didn't flesh out any of the characters I was interested in.

 The movie has too many head-scratching, `what-were-they-thinking-of,' scenes like that to serious consider it a classic.  I threw my five stars at it becomes it gave us Clint as a practically pure vessel of retribution.  He doesn't get cute in the role, or often lose that snarl and squint, but it's a pleasure to see him track `em down and - to please the judge - bring them back alive (whenever possible.)  Keep your eyes open for a young Dennis Hopper playing a deranged character named The Preacher.  I knew he was in the movie but didn't recognize him.  He appears early on and Marshal Ben Johnson is the one trying to chain him up and bring him in.

 If you're not a fan of Eastwood's western this one may not appeal to you.  There's a lot in it that doesn't much appeal to me, but the spine of the story - Eastwood's quest for revenge - was strong enough for me to overlook its weaker elements.",1145750400,,3172,4.456597222222222
873493,5,6304429703,"Not being a fan of Westerns, I figured I would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on.  The opening scene completely sucked me in, though, and the movie took off from there.  The movie opens with Eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend's cattle.  Eastwood is left to die, only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail, where his story is verified by the judge, and Eastwood gets a job as a marshal.  His intention, of course, is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice.  The action in the movie consists of Eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt, all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare.

The movie even manages to touch on moral issues, when Eastwood wants clemency for an outlaw who helped him out, but is denied by the judge.  The judge himself grapples with issues of having the ultimate power of law over the territory, not knowing the ""right"" action, and wishing for statehood so that he wouldn't have the power of God over criminals.

The low point of the movie was Eastwood's romance with a beautiful, emotionally scarred blonde woman.  There is a painfully slow picnic and lovemaking scene, which drags on while the audience wants Eastwood to get back to his mission of rounding up outlaws.  Other than that, the movie is excellent.",1134864000,2,1345,4.61344537815126
873556,4,6304429703,"Jed Cooper (Clint Eastwood) was herding cattle when a group of men came on him suddenly.  The men ask Jed where he got the cattle.  In spite of Jed's law enforcement background and a signed bill of sale, the men think that Jed killed the owner of the cattle and stole them.  The men hang Jed.  Unfortunately for the men who hung Jed, they did a poor job.

After another lawman rescues him, Jed becomes a federal marshal working for Judge Adam Fenton (Pat Hingle).  Much of the interaction between Judge Fenton and Marshal Cooper involves Coopers killing of many of the men he encounters (which tends to be a theme in Clint Eastwood movies anyway).  Marshal Cooper is relentless in the search for bad guys, most especially the lynch mob that did a bad job of hanging him.  Unfortunately, sometimes these men do not want to go with him and he has to give them a little Jed Cooper justice on the spot.

During the course of this movie we meet a host of names that were famous in the 50s and 60s, and a couple that became more famous after the movie.  Inger Stevens plays the enigmatic and beautiful Rachel Warren.  Ed Begley (father of Ed Begley, Jr. and a veteran actor of film and television) plays Captain Wilson, the head of the lynch mob.  Ben Johnson plays Marshal Dave Bliss, who is the man who rescues Jed Cooper.  Bruce Dern and Alan Hale, both veterans of westerns, are also part of the hanging party.  Dennis Hopper and James McArthur also have relatively minor parts in this 1968 film.

This film was an excellent film for Clint Eastwood.  He appeared in three 1968 films, the other two being ""Coogan's Bluff"" and ""Where Eagles Dare.""  ""Where Eagles Dare"" is a better movie, but Eastwood's acting in that movie was relatively limited.  Eastwood's role in ""Coogan's Bluff"" was somewhat stereotypical and not one of Eastwood's better films.  However, ""Hang `Em High"" is already a classic western and one of the best of Eastwood's early U.S. films in that it allowed Eastwood to demonstrate that he could act.

873558,4,6304429703,"A good western is about two themes: violence and justice.  ""Hang 'em High"", mostly overlooked beneath the shadow of Eastwood's work with Sergio Leone of the same period, is a surprisingly deep examination of these themes as they play out in pre-statehood Oklahoma.

The film works through three different storylines, all of which come together to address the primary theme of the picture.

The central storyline is a simple revenge tale.  Eastwood's character, former lawman Jed Cooper, is wrongfully hanged by a gang of nine vigilantes.  Saved from death by an honest marshall, Cooper becomes a lawman once again as deputy marshall in the Oklahoma Territory.  With the blessing of the territory's judge, he embarks on a mission to round up those who were responsible for his hanging.

Along the way, he pursues and apprehends three cattle rustlers who had done murder.  Among them are two young men who claim they had nothing to do with the decision to murder the man, and the two cooperate with Cooper's effort to bring all three men to town to face justice.  The mob that helped him catch the men had wanted to hang them on the spot, but Cooper insisted that they be taken into custody and brought before a court of law.  Back in town, Cooper stands up for the two young men and doesn't want to see them hanged.  The judge sees things differently: the people demand justice as they see it, and the way they see it is through a hanging.  If the judge doesn't hang them all, then the people will take the law into their own hands, just as they did wrongfully try to hang Cooper himself.

The third storyline is that of the pretty, young blond girl.  The jailors and lawmen are all under orders to let her examine every outlaw brought into town.  She later reveals that she's looking for two men in particular, two men who had done her a great wrong in the past.

In large part, this is a film about the death penalty and the merits of the retributivist theory of justice.  If the girl were to find those two men, would their hanging do her any good?  What if she never found them?  Does Cooper need to find the men who've done him wrong?  What to do with those he does find?

Whether men are hanged or spared their lives, there are consequences.  There are consequences both for individuals seeking justice, and for society as a whole.  There are consequences for those who perpetrate violence and those who are victimized by it.  ""Hang 'em High"" engages the viewer on these subjects, and in so doing exceeds the expectation that it is just another shoot-'em-up gunslinger picture.

The musical score, an integral part of any good western, both hits and misses.  It hits with a great, memorable theme.  You probably have heard the theme even if you've never seen the film.  The score misses, however, by muddying up the theme with the full orchestration commonplace in MGM studio pictures of the time.  In many places, the score sounds like it was yanked directly out of ""Star Wars"", and the music produces a mood that doesn't fit with the film.

Overall, this is a western that does all the typically western elements right.  It surpasses expectations by delivering on an engaging storyline about the ethics of justice.  ""Hang 'em High"" is an excellent film.  I'm compelled to drop it down to 4 stars, however, by the way that it stumbles about for the first 30 minutes or so trying to find its groove, and by the way the score seems misplaced in those early scenes.  It fully recovers and becomes a great western, but doesn't quite reach the heights of perfection reached by ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" or ""A Fistful of Dollars.""",1122768000,8,3637,4.6049766718507

Hang `em High is Clint Eastwood's first American ""spaghetti"" western and undoubtedly the one that furthered his launch into mega stardom.  Upon excitedly opening the DVD case and placing the DVD into the player, one discovers that the only special feature is a theatrical trailer.  This is fine, as one doesn't truly purchase these DVD's for special features as much as they do for the movie.  While watching the theatrical trailer, I got the impression that this movie seemed as though it might lack the ""true grit"" style of his previous spaghetti westerns; this impression couldn't have been farther off though.  Hang `em High has a truly well written script and is played perfectly by all involved.
The premise:
Clint Eastwood plays Jed Cooper, a former law man from St. Louis, MO.  As the movie begins, we see him herding cattle past a river and he's approached by nine riders.  We soon learn that Jed thought he'd purchased these cattle honestly, but the person he bought them from was a criminal and now Jed's going to pay for it because these nine riders are a lynch mob and they intend to hang Jed.
Fortunately for Jed, a law man comes by and cuts him down from the tree before he dies and throws him in the wagon with a bunch of other criminals headed towards the only court in the Oklahoma territory and run by the ""Hanging Judge.""  As luck would have it though, his story checks out and the judge offers him a job as a Federal Marshal.  What follows is a great western filled with Clint Eastwood's ""true grit"" western hero style as he sets out for vengeance upon those who attempted but failed to hang him.
I would highly recommend this outstanding western for those who favor this genre heavily or casually and especially for those who are Eastwood fans!  {ssintrepid}",1049500800,48,1915,4.686567164179104

873628,4,6304429703,"Clint Eastwood had just completed perhaps the most successful trifecta in Hollywood western history with his ""Man with No Name"" trilogy.  Those three films were marked by a melding of unforgettable Ennio Morricone music with the grubbiness that seemed to afflict the entire cast.  This Eastwood was laconic and possessed of a dry sense of humor.  In HANG 'EM HIGH, Eastwood is a preppier, more law abiding loner who has the great bad fortune to purchase rustled cattle from their abductors, and is promptly lynched by a gang of vigilantes who mean well, but in whose disregard for the niceities of law, the focus of the film is squarely placed. The west of this movie, unlike the west of his 'No Name' trilogy, may, in the words of Pat Hingle, the 'hanging judge' be so big that it dwarfs five states put together, yet that does not mean that it is bereft of any law and order.  Eastwood, as Jed Cooper, survives the lynching, only to be offered a marshal's badge to bring to justice his lynchers.  At the moment that Cooper puts on that badge, director Ted Post indicates that HANG 'EM HIGH is a morality movie disguised as a revenge oater.  No one understands this better than Pat Hingle, as the hanging judge, who every day has to balance the expediency involved in hanging condemned criminals with the sobering thought that in his court he is 'the law, all the law.'  Unlike Cooper, who has him to answer to, the judge has only his conscience.  Because Eastwood presents himself as a transition figure between the ponchoed Man with no Name that he just was and the brute law and order icon that he would shortly morph into as Dirty Harry, he does not dominate each scene.  Nor is there a dramatic vacuum when he blends into the background.  Into his place swarms a host of a very capable supporting cast.  Inger Stevens is particularly appealing as a troubled woman who has survived the physical trauma of rape only to find the emotional aftereffects as far more lingering.  For those students of film who are acquainted with the details of Miss Stevens' troubled life that began in depression and ended in real-life suicide, her performance as the tormented victim takes on the hopeless overtones of art imitating life.  Her ability to slowly blossom under the healing hand of Cooper is touching.  Bruce Dern reprises a role that he has done countless times as both a big and small screen crazy.  Dern is the leader of a gang composed of a pair of impressionably young brothers who, under other circumstances, might have turned out as decent citizens.  In fact, the primary irony of HANG 'EM HIGH is that with the exception of Dern, who brags that he is 'truly as guilty as sin,' every other character is either good or a flawed version of good.  Even Cooper's lynchers thought they were doing society a favor by skipping the cost of a trial.  What emerges is a cinematic metaphor that clearly shows what happens even to good people who seek to do society a favor by circumventing the very rights of those charged with truly heinous crimes.  The inner debate that Marshal Jed Cooper had to wage during his pursuit of the men who lynched him is shared by an audience who slowly comes to realize that the hanging judge, in all his exhortations about the necessary triumph of written law over vigilante order, was right all along.",1042934400,4,3332,4.645655877342419

Eastwood is an everyman, just a rancher.  He buys some cattle from a passing drive, only to learn they are stolen.  The true owners come along, and hang him before the truth can be ascertained.  A passing lawman finds him swinging from a tree, saves his life and puts him in a jail wagon until his story can be figured out.  The rest of the movie is Eastwood's tracking down those bad guys (not  relevant is the fact that for the most part they are ""good and true citizens"") and bringing them to justice; either at the jailhouse or by his bullets.  And Eastwood revenge is something else - he even shoots the dog!
Eastwood's character, Marshall Cooper is another strong and silent type, just like ""The Man With No Name"" whom we have come to expect in the Leone westerns.  Unlike the spaghetti westerns, though, this time while he is again basically a good guy, he is now on the establishment side.
Eastwood is joined by a positively fabulous supporting cast:  Western veterans Ben Johnson and Ed Begley, Pat Hingle as a true hangin' judge, Dennis Hopper (who is such a  psycho even then, we are glad to see that he is the first guy killed in the film), Bruce Dern, L.Q. Jones.  Surprising appearances are entered by Gilligan's Skipper, Alan Hale and Steve McGarrett's Five-0 sidekick ""Dano"", James McArthur.  And for the true Star Trek cognoscenti, we have an appearance by Mark Leonard, who gave up his job as Oklahoma Territory Prosecuting Attorney to become Sarek, a/k/a Father of Spock.
Unlike some other reviewers, I found the more polished (as opposed to the Leone western trilogy) soundtrack superior to the movies which had preceded it.  I also thought the cinematography supeerior here, with some breathtaking vistas.

Lots of reviewers dog this one out for not being up to the standards of the Leone trilogy. However, I think it is their equal, because the characters have more depth.  Maybe I am just not the fan of minimalist genre of S. Leone.  Nonetheless, I particularly find the bad guys are more complex than any in the spaghetti westerns, and I find this more pleasing.
It is one of my very favorite shoot-em-ups.  As reviewer L.S.W. says, western fans need this movie.",1038614400,29,2330,4.711111111111111
873630,5,6304429703,"Although not as stylized or polished as Josey Wales, High Plains Drifter, or The Leone trilogy, Hang 'em high still has a lot too offer. For once the villans aren't stereotyped bad guys, they're real people. The film has it's flaws, mainly the over done Pat Hingle charachter who loves the noose, and the seemingly forced romance between Eastwood and Stevens. Still, as most of you know an average Eastwood Western is still better than most. And though, you might not be compelled to buy it, you will at least not kick yourself for watching it.",1030406400,,544,4.677083333333333
873631,5,6304429703,"Ok, it is no Leone film, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a great movie. You have one of Eastwood's stronger roles and a great supporting cast (everyone from Bruce Dern to Dennis Hopper is in this one). You also have a graphic and horrifying opening sequence. The story is Eastwood is mistaken for a rustler, mistakenly lynched. He survives, becomes a marshall and hunts down the men who did it, falling in love along the way. And underneath it all, there is the director's commentary on capital punishment. The film leaves a few loose ends, not enough for a sequal (if that is what he was thinking at the time), or really enough to make the viewer think. Instead, just enough questions to annoy the watcher. Still, it is one of Eastwood's best movies.
As a dvd it falls way short. The picture and sound quality aren't much better than what you would find on video cassette. There are no extras, just the trailer for the film (and a badly done trailer it is). But I would pick it up just for the quality of film it is.",1028160000,,1023,4.389473684210526
873632,2,6304429703,"If you loved the ""Dollars"" Triolgy then you'll definately be let down. HANG EM HIGH is the American version of a spaghetti western and does not come anywhere close to the genius of Sergio Leone. The music is [inferior] and the scenery shots are of stock quality. The filmmaker even tries the famous Leone close up technique but it's lost in bad acting.
HANG EM tries hard to be a good film. It has a good plot (Clint seeks revenge for a mistaken hanging) but the characters are weak and underdeveloped, and the sub-plots are not followed up (Rachel's revenge, senseless hangings and the question of justice, the 2 remaining lynch party members). The film ends aburptly and has the feel of a late 1960's TV show.
Other than a few good scenes (Clint carring the cattle comes to mind) the film was quite boring with no surprise action and twists. It plays out just as you would expect it. Do yourself a favor and see FOR A FEW DOLARS MORE, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY instead.",1027728000,6,1003,4.456521739130435
