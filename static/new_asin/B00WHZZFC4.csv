7132567,5,B00WHZZFC4,"I loved this season just as much as I loved the second season I really don't understand why so many people say the the second season is bad, the only conclusion I can come to is that the people that aren't fond of this anime are voicing there opinion more than people that like this anime and others are just jumping on the band wagon ""This person said this sucked so it has to be true"". Like I said I am a fan of this season and was a fan of the first season and really hope that there is a third season coming this series touched my hart and I'm generally a cold person. The charters are likable, (Yuta is frustrating at times tho) there is a strong dub, and it actually makes you feel something, over all its a great anime.",1440633600,7,726,4.083916083916084
7132568,5,B00WHZZFC4,"Since I have the collector's edition of the first season, I had to get the second! I am happy with the items overall. I am just glad nothing was missing unlike the box I got from season one. I couldn't wait for it to go on sale so I bought it the first chance I could get. I personally don't like the dub all too much, but I originally watched the series subbed so that maybe a reason why I don't think Rikka's English voice actress doesn't fit her. I'm actually curious what other people think of the dub.

It is well worth the price if you're a big fan of Chuunibyou. I mainly bought this for all of the extra goodies and the box.",1483056000,,632,4.056
7132569,5,B00WHZZFC4,"This and the original series are two of my favorites -- almost unbearably cute, funny, and childishly romantic.",1477699200,,111,5.222222222222222

7132576,5,B00WHZZFC4,"I loved this Anime, it is just one of the great odd Anime you will end up loving. This one is the 2nd season and I hope they will re-release the 1st season again a just the DVD pack as Dubbed and Sub.",1443571200,2,200,3.6744186046511627

8713539,4,B00WHZZFC4,"Though the story was decent, the fact romance is in the title is completely misleading.  You never see anything about it and there is truly never any rivalry as depicted.",1500854400,,170,4.666666666666667
8713540,5,B00WHZZFC4,"Its a great anime, cringy as hell, but great art, story, and voice acting. I recommend getting the regular ver. If this one is not on sale. Basiclly get the anime when convienient, totally worth it.",1494892800,,198,4.527777777777778

8713545,3,B00WHZZFC4,"The sequel to Love Chunibyo and Other Delusions, Heart Throb does not add new plot twists to the previous story and it continues along with the same slice of life formula of its predecessor. There is one new character, a girl that Yuuta knew in the past and may harbor feelings for him. There is a love triangle thing that occurs in this season, a few one off episodes dealing with the other main characters and that's about it. The relationship between Rikka and Yuuta is still trotting along slowly  (A bit too slowly, but hey, they're new to this) there aren't any big romantic moments between them but they are still pretty cute together.

Heart Throb is more episodic than the previous series but doesn't have such a confused vision of what it wants to be or what its message is. At its heart this is just a cute romcom anime with quirky characters and is a good watch for a quick pick me up. If you liked the first Chunibyo then you'd likely enjoy this as well. Just don't expect too much.",1485734400,2,995,4.4021739130434785
8713546,5,B00WHZZFC4,A wonderful end to a great series.,1485302400,,34,4.0
