1655543,3,B00005RIX9,"Mummy Raider is from that infamous lesbian sex label, Seduction Cinema. When I purchased this, I sort of knew what I was getting into, but I just couldn't pass up Misty Mundae. She is just lovely. Anyway, the plot is about a German Nazi girl (Esmerelda DeLarocca) in Berlin who kidnaps a scientists daughter (Darian Caine,) who is the only person that knows the secret to raise an ancient mummy that the Nazi girl took from Egypt(?). So on and so forth, the mummy is raised and Caine's lesbian lover, who happens to be a mummy raider, Misty, saves the day. They are so happy to see each other that they don't even wait to get it on and do it right there in front of the tied up Nazi. The Nazi girl promises to be good if they let her go and she then joins in(?). Doesn't that go against everything the Nazi's stood for? Anyway, the whole movie is just over an hour and has some pretty action packed moments, but the lesbian scenes (the whole purpose for the movie) is, surprisingly, pretty weak. There are some funny one-liners and interesting scenes if you can put up with this type of exploitation movie. There are quite a few extras though, including a music video for the theme song, and another short movie about...you guessed it! Lesbianism. Plus there is some behind the scenes stuff and trailers for other movies from this company. Only for those that like this sort of thing.",1014422400,13,1384,4.474308300395257

7952331,5,B00005RIX9,"Misty Mundae, the Mummy Raider,,, a parody from Angelina'a Jolie's Tomb Raider... is both hilarious and very erotic. Misty Mundae is seen in this movie short,,, running time actually only 46 minutes,, rocks a mummy's world, blowing the mummy's head off... Her lines, "" we got mummy problems,, before she shoots the mummy followed by the killer line, "" Thats why they call me the Mummy Raider"" with her girl next store warm captivating magnetic smile wins every heart of every Misty Mundae Fan. We see her shooting both guns a blazing reminicent of Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider... but then comes the most Erotic Lesbian scene I have ever seen Misty Mundae in,, she mounts Darian Caine like a man does a woman, need I go on,,, and the tender kisses, and caresses, make's one's blood boil.. very steamy erotica at it's very best,, For a movie Short, it is not short of Erotica that lengthens your desire,,, Seduction Cinema has another winner, I only hope they follow through as mentioned in behind scenes,, special features that they make more movie shorts, i.e. Mummy Raider part II , part III,, and so on,, if Angelina Jolie could have at least two Tomb Raiders,, why not,, so Seduction Cinema ,,  bring it on,, I will buy it,, of course I buy anything with my Girl, Misty Mundae in it,, and Darian Caine,, I give this movie a 5 start rating for originality, a 5 star rating for Misty Mundae and Darian Caine's performance, ,, well worth the purchase... I love you Misty Mundae,,,,",1183680000,2,1482,4.634980988593156
7952332,4,B00005RIX9,"Overall this is a movie that is typical of the type of movie you expect from this group. However it was one of the better ones. Not much on the plot line, but who cares? Misty Mundae was the center piece of the movie, that in itself was worth the price. For Misty fans this is a must have movie.",1162512000,4,295,3.933333333333333
7952333,2,B00005RIX9,"The problem with Seduction is they have such a bevy of beauties (Darian; Misty; Esmerelda) but they misuse them. The company aspires to be more than a softcore Playboy type, but with their directors (who don't know how to shoot sex) they end up with worse.

Which brings us to Mummy Raider.

Darian Caine is a hot, young archeologist (sure, I'll buy that) who is after the secrets of the Mummy, along with her middle age father. They are suddenly attacked by a beautiful NAZI (Esmerelda DeLarocca) bent on having the secrets for herself so she can rule the world. She decides to torture Darian until she gives up the secrets--all while her father watches (yeah, a bit incestual here). Torture to that evil hottie apparently consists of fondling and kissing Darian (poor girl!).

Twenty minutes have now passed.

Meanwhile, in a deserted warehouse, several armed men are on patrol--when Misty Mundae, Mummy Raider, leaps into their midst! She is blazing away with dual pistols ala Lara Croft, blasting villains to and fro. When she has dispatched everyone, she rushes into the Mummy chamber to stop the evil NAZI from molesting poor Darian. The father is untied, whereupon he says he'll get the police. Now the three beauties are left alone. I wonder what will happen next?

The lovely NAZI expresses regret for nearly destroying the world; and Misty and Darian, those lovely compassionate Christians, decide to follow the golden rule and forgive the lovely NAZI. Thus follows an orgy between the three.

Now, before I get to the sex, I must say that the one thing Seduction has going for it is the kissing. Unlike softcore movies, and most hardcore films, these movies have lots of girl on girl tongue action. I'm talking all the time. Throughout every sex scene the girls are constantly, passionately kissing--which explains why, as much as I hate these movies, I keep buying them. You just will not find anything like this anywhere else.

Still, the sex is attrocious. Even though the women have no problem with being completely nude (showing certain areas that only hardcore dares to show) and making out--they seem to shy away from sexual contact. And it wouldn't be so bad, but the director does not know how to shoot sex. Where someone knowledgable would shoot a certain angle from the side, this person shoots it from above, clearly letting us see that Darian is not doing what she appears to be and is obviously kissing Misty's upper thigh. It is really lame decisions like that that really hamper these films. Oh, and there is one more reason this movie sucks--

It is forty minutes long!

That's right. Thirty minutes of NAZI crap with ten minutes of fake sex. But luckily (sarcasm here) they producers included a short film on the DVD about Esmarelda's first time with a woman. Of course, it is fifteen minutes of talk with ten minutes of fake sex. Yeah, that really made the purchase worth more.

So, there you go. That is Mummy Raider. If you like a movie with chicks kissing, buy Gladiator Eroticus. Otherwise...",1094169600,8,3026,4.790786948176583
7952334,3,B00005RIX9,"In judging this movie, you have to compare the pluses and minuses.  On the positive side, you have both Misty Mundae and Darian Caine (excellent), a significant amount of gunfire and explosions, a bit of a catfight, and the kind of female-specific activity that pretty much defines what Seduction Cinema is all about.  On the negative side, however, you have the pretty important fact that this movie is short, even shorter than it appears.  Disregarding any outtakes that might be included, you have a feature of about 46 minutes-but, there is actually a good bit of padding here (I'm talking about the movie, not the girls-they don't require any padding).  The opening credits feature video clips of the coming action and run about two minutes, and the final six minutes or so consists of even more video clips of the action; at one point, they get tired of showing the same clips over and over and start flashing up still shots from the movie instead.  All told, you are looking at about 35 minutes of action.  I really don't know why the movie was not stretched out to a longer length; after all, a Tomb Raider spoof certainly has enough material to work with to manufacture at least an hour's worth of story, and Seduction Cinema certainly is familiar with adding scenes that are totally irrelevant to the plot.
The story isn't very compelling this time around (as if it really even matters when you're talking about Seduction Cinema movies).  Dr. Humboldt (Esmerelda deLarocca) is a scientist trying to hasten the emergence of the Fourth Reich by bringing Hitler's minions back to life.  To accomplish this, her team has gotten their hands on the mummy of Thotep, supposedly Egypt's most-feared pharaoh.  What Dr. Humboldt needs is the secret for reanimating the mummy so that she can learn from him the secrets of life and death.  Professor Kleve and his daughter Kristen (Darian Caine) have this information, so they have been captured and brought to headquarters.  Kristen is convinced that her ""very good friend"" Misty Mundae, the Mummy Raider, will rescue her.  All of the action (and I do mean all of the action) starts when Misty shows up with guns blaring, pigtails flying, and clothes dropping.  The special effects aren't that bad for this type of movie, and I was rather pleased with the mummy's appearance.  The lesbian love scene is unfortunately far short of steamy, and a two-part yet continuous scene is all you get before the movie ends so prematurely.  All told, the disappointing aspects of Mummy Raider largely cancel out the positive qualities of the film, making this a fairly average Seduction Cinema offering.  Misty Mundae fans, though, have the added incentive of watching her strut her stuff in that enticing little Mummy Raider outfit.",1044489600,11,2769,4.884615384615385
