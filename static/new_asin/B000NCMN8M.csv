8176636,5,B000NCMN8M,"a truly great doc about some astounding men... adrian belic is a master moviemaker and should be getting much more attention and credit than he is currently receiving.  perhaps history will resolve that, and i hope it takes place before adrian is too old to appreciate the much-deserved acclaim.",1357689600,,295,5.020408163265306
8176637,5,B000NCMN8M,"This is one of the most extraodinary movies about 3 of the most extraordinary men and their work on the front lines that I have ever seen. And everyone who watches it with me agrees.  Plus they are hilarious!  In a world darkened by hatred and greed, it is uplifting to know there are folk (and American!) dedicating their lives to help others.",1285372800,,344,4.444444444444445
8176638,5,B000NCMN8M,"This film will inspire and amaze you with the work that three ordinary men have accomplished. The movie left me with two burning thoughts: 1) How can I help? 2) How do I do more with my life? Sadly,one of the three -  Walt Ratterman, was killed in the Haiti earthquake on Feb. 12, 2010 while on a humanitarian mission to provide solar power to health clinics.",1267574400,,359,4.358208955223881

Adrian Belic really hit a home run with this movie!  The subject is compelling on its own, but it would not have the same direct-to-the-heart impact without the way that Belic put the movie together.  He lays out the story in a way that makes you want to know more, yet he leaves the right amount of detail to fill your mind to the brim in 80 minutes.  Near the end he starts bringing it home with the ""why we do it"" part of the story.  It chokes me up every time I see it.  It is difficult to walk away from this movie without your mind full of serious thoughts about how one might be more involved with humanitarian aid.",1228694400,,763,4.293706293706293

Beyond the Call by Adrian Belic is a modern day adventure story of three ordinary men who go to extraordinary lengths to help those in need. The film, which did well at Tribeca and San Francisco follows the work of Knightsbridge as its three founders go to some of the most dangerous places on earth to bring aid to those in need. This film is a cross between Indiana Jones and Mother Theresa. The film is well worth seeing but it can be somewhat difficult to acquire. If given the chance by all means see it. I have been told that a more commercial version of this film will be released in April 2008.

The second film, The Motherhood Manifesto, explores the grass roots efforts to improve children's rights and to end discrimination against mothers. The film is based on the book of the same title by Joan Blades and Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner. It presents its points in a clear concise fashion and should be required watching for anyone interested in childcare or children's health issues.

The Interview with Jody Willima is from the film Nobelity. The film is a collection of interviews with Nobel Peace Prize winners. Williams won the prize in 1997 for her campaign to ban land mines. The point of this segment is that peace can come about through change.

All in all a worthwhile edition to any collection of socially conscious documentaries and a worthwhile viewing experience.
