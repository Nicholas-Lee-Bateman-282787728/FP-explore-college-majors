ECHO BRIDGE has come a long way since their days of scruffy public domain B&W oldies.
Transfer sources are generally fine, with dubs that are widescreen and stereo sound.

Images on this set are less than sharp, but not terribly so. Audio is strong.

I've watched the first three films, HURT, THE CELLAR DOOR and THE CRY.
Manufacturer synopses for these on AMMY's product page are accurate.

HURT is standard horror fare, a withdrawn little girl who reveals a homicidal
streak. As with most of this type, the child's violent behavior has a cause.

The creepazoid who holds a woman hostage in a little chicken wire wrapped prison
box in THE CELLAR DOOR tries to act reasonable, but his evil side is never far
under the surface. (Watch for the Jehovah's Witnesses who come calling.)

Of the three, THE CRY is creepiest in style, a classic (if brief) ghost story taken
to a modern setting, NYC. According to the film's preface, La Llorana (the
Weeping Woman) has over 28 million believers.

OK, so one-third through and I'm satisfied I got my money's worth.
All three frighters were well-made, one gorier than the others.
BTW, BAY COVEN is an oldie but goodie TV movie with a cast of familiar faces (see below).
