So when I saw this I assumed that they would have an episode associated to outer space.  No just the brief chase of the last little piggy.  Something tells me that Disney knows what they did and are just trying to get more money.  Unfortunately, our kids pay the price because like the other reviewers our son was so excited and then angry because he didn't get the race for space show.

My daughter is a ""Little Einsteins"" fanatic but when she saw that there actually wasn't a movie or episode called ""The Race For Space"" she was absolutely disappointed.  Let me tell you, if I knew that there was only one new episode on this DVD I never would have wasted my money on it.  We have almost every episode recorded on our DVR and I'm sure the only new episode on this DVD will be on Disney soon so this was a complete waste of money.

We, too, pre-ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release.  And we, too, were bitterly disappointed by its contents.  As the other reviewers have said, it is not a movie, and it is not about space.  I would think that if Disney were going to release a space-themed DVD containing old episodes, they would at least include Galactic Goodnight.  At least that one actually talked about the planets.  I would not have purchased this if I would have been able to preview it before buying.  :(",1203724800,11,639,4.543859649122807

He was so excited when we finally got the DVD he knew we pre-ordered it and was patiently waiting for it to come.  When he finally watched it, he actually started crying-very unlike him.  He said the new ""space"" show wasn't really about space at all.  We had expected that it would be about the little Einsteins traveling from planet to planet, learning about each one.  It isn't. They just happen to be traveling through space chasing/helping some little pigs.  What a missed chance at teaching kids about the planets!  Again-we were VERY disappointed.",1203638400,20,632,4.73394495412844
3041746,2,B000ZIZ0S4,"Be aware that this DVD is not a new full-length movie, but rather a collection of three episodes. According to the packaging, one of the three episodes is nevore-before seen. However, here in Canada all three have been previously shown on TV, so none of them were new to us.

For those of you not familiar with this series, two DVD releases have full one-hour movies (Our Big Huge Adventure and Rocket's Firebird Rescue). All other DVD releases contain 3 TV episodes. Based on the product description, I was under the impression that this was a new one-hour movie, but it is not.

Furthermore, if you're expecting a space-related theme, you'll be disappointed. In the episode entitled Super Fast, they go out in space briefly, but that's it. In my opinion the title for this release is misleading as it is not space-oriented at all.

In short: no new material and overall a big disappointment as far as I'm concerned. Would not buy again had I known.

FYI the episodes on this DVD are:
- The Treasure Behind The Little Red Door (supposedly new but was shown on TV in Canada already)
- Super Fast
- The Great Sky Race Rematch",1203552000,15,1124,4.577114427860696

3041778,4,B000ZIZ0S4,"As with all the Little Einsteins DVDs, this one contains two previously seen episodes, along with an ""all new"" episode not yet aired at the time of release.  Disney has followed this format on all of the Little Einsteins DVDs so it was not a surpise for us.  Perhaps, eventually, there WILL be an all new, full length movie, but that is not what Disney is releasing at this time.

My 3 year old daughter LOVES Little Einsteins, as do I.  Each episode includes a piece of classical music, a piece of art, and a lesson.  The characters are large and bright; and there is always dancing, singing, and a specific musical instrument.  In general, ALL the Little Einsteins episodes are well done.  They capture and keep my daughter's attention, and she walks around the house humming classical tunes.  We purchase all the DVDs so that we can ""view on demand,"" rather than waiting for the right time.

The DVD is what it is, and is no more or less than I expected.  We have enjoyed watching this together.  I recommend it for any Little Einsteins fan.",1208044800,,1044,4.529411764705882

3041784,4,B000ZIZ0S4,"GOOD: Three episodes go well together, typical Little Einstein fare, good lessons

BAD: One weak episode, no coverage of planets / space, DVD extras are worthless and not subtitled.

Little Einsteins: Race for Space comes with three episodes, one of which hasn't aired as of the DVD's initial release. One person reports it aired in Canada, however.

I understand the disappointment from other reviewers. The DVD case does say that it's two episodes plus one new one -- nothing about being an original movie like the other DVDs. The DVD also doesn't go into depth about the planets as one might thing from the title.

The never before aired episode, ""The Treasure behind the Little Red Door,"" has kids and Rocket tracking a stolen treasure map to Hawaii. The art of the day is the Hawaii Ki'i (hula) statue and the featured song is ""Funeral March of a Marionette"" by Charles Francois Gounod.

After stealing the treasure map from the gang, Big Jet races pass a volcano, across the bay, and into a rain forest. The gang follows closely behind. Beware this episode contains spider webs and an ugly yellow spider with a freaky smile. It might scare kids who are afraid of insects. However, the bug doesn't bother the four-year-old critic.

""Treasure"" is one of the weaker episodes in the series. The story doesn't weave together well and most of it slumps along. The story feels incomplete without truly diving into the things expected of the Little Einsteins. While this episode isn't typical Little Einstein fare, it makes sense that it comes on this DVD because of its connection to the last episode. The more important critic, the four-year-old, likes the episode.

In the next show, ""Super Fast,"" three little piggies and their flying machines join the Einsteins in episode #36, first airing in March, 2007. Here the show introduces ""The William Tell Overture"" by Gioachino Rossini and Chinese cut paper.

Leo and the gang fill up Rocket with music gas to help Rocket fly at different tempos, or speeds -- adagio, moderato, allegro, and presto. To catch up with each flying piggy, the gang changes tempo to match or surpass the tempo of the piggy's airplane. One piggy is stuck flying on adagio, another on moderato, and the third on allegro.

Children learn tempo while discovering Machu Picchu in Peru and China. While in China, the artful backgrounds and scenery are made of Chinese paper cuttings. The mix of the flying speeds and locales keep the kids interested. The little critic confirms his interest by enthusiastically retelling the story of the little piggies' flights in different directions. One piggie flies into space. That's it -- nothing more.

Episode #41 from May 2007, ""The Great Sky Race Rematch"" again features ""The William Tell Overture"" with artwork titled ""Whirlpool and Waves at Naruto, Awa Province"" by Utagawa Hiroshige. Rocket enters the Great Sky Race again after winning the previous year's race. Rival Big Jet also enters the race and plays a few nasty tricks on Rocket. The kids use tempo and creativity to overcome barriers that Big Jet puts up for Rocket.

""The Great Sky Race Rematch"" shows how the gang uses creativity to overcome the barriers they run into in the race. It's also a good way to learn how to face adversity. The episode balances all the elements of a good kids' show, including pace that meets their attention spans, strong yet simple storylines, sweetness without sugar overload, and an adventure with a purpose.

The three episodes go well together with the first and last episodes guest starring Big Jet. The second episode teaches tempo and the last episode ties everything together.

Bonus features include a ""Rocket Around the World"" interactive activity, which takes kids on a trip to four locales. However, it's very slow even for adults and not very interactive. Kids use the remote control to pick the right Rocket vehicle for traveling to the different locations. That's all there is to it.

Two videos starring Playhouse Disney's Lou and Lou Safety Patrol cover racing and buckling for safety. Unfortunately, these bonus shorts and ""Rocket Around the World"" don't have closed-captions or English subtitles. Though the bonuses don't offer much, the Little Einsteins fans will watch and enjoy the DVD because they're most interested in the familiar faces on the cover.

The four-year-old Little Einsteins critic sums up his review in one sentence: ""I really like the movie!"" And he watched it again and again and again. The nine-year-old -- who is into the more hardcore shows like SpongeBob Squarepants and Avatar -- even sat with him a couple of times and he wouldn't do that if the show didn't interest him. Little Einsteins: Race for Space earns applause for presenting an enjoyable educational program that parents won't dread watching for the twentieth time. Preview a clip from Race for Space.

My daughter was asking for space race she saw advertised for a while and I finally got it for her. She was so excited to watch it and when we started (during a road trip), she was so disappointed and was complaining that she wanted race for space and not this one and why did I tell her that I got race for space when I did not...

Disney has followed this format on all of the Little Einsteins DVDs so it was not a surpise for us.  Perhaps, eventually, there WILL be an all new, full length movie, but that is not what Disney is releasing at this time.

My 3 year old daughter LOVES Little Einsteins, as do I.  Each episode includes a piece of classical music, a piece of art, and a lesson.  The characters are large and bright; and there is always dancing, singing, and a specific musical instrument.  In general, ALL the Little Einsteins episodes are well done.  They capture and keep my daughter's attention, and she walks around the house humming classical tunes.  We purchase all the DVDs so that we can ""view on demand,"" rather than waiting for the right time.

3276281,4,B000ZIZ0S4,"GOOD: Three episodes go well together, typical Little Einstein fare, good lessons

BAD: One weak episode, no coverage of planets / space, DVD extras are worthless and not subtitled.

Little Einsteins: Race for Space comes with three episodes, one of which hasn't aired as of the DVD's initial release. One person reports it aired in Canada, however.

I understand the disappointment from other reviewers. The DVD case does say that it's two episodes plus one new one -- nothing about being an original movie like the other DVDs. The DVD also doesn't go into depth about the planets as one might thing from the title.

The never before aired episode, ""The Treasure behind the Little Red Door,"" has kids and Rocket tracking a stolen treasure map to Hawaii. The art of the day is the Hawaii Ki'i (hula) statue and the featured song is ""Funeral March of a Marionette"" by Charles Francois Gounod.

After stealing the treasure map from the gang, Big Jet races pass a volcano, across the bay, and into a rain forest. The gang follows closely behind. Beware this episode contains spider webs and an ugly yellow spider with a freaky smile. It might scare kids who are afraid of insects. However, the bug doesn't bother the four-year-old critic.

""Treasure"" is one of the weaker episodes in the series. The story doesn't weave together well and most of it slumps along. The story feels incomplete without truly diving into the things expected of the Little Einsteins. While this episode isn't typical Little Einstein fare, it makes sense that it comes on this DVD because of its connection to the last episode. The more important critic, the four-year-old, likes the episode.

In the next show, ""Super Fast,"" three little piggies and their flying machines join the Einsteins in episode #36, first airing in March, 2007. Here the show introduces ""The William Tell Overture"" by Gioachino Rossini and Chinese cut paper.

Leo and the gang fill up Rocket with music gas to help Rocket fly at different tempos, or speeds -- adagio, moderato, allegro, and presto. To catch up with each flying piggy, the gang changes tempo to match or surpass the tempo of the piggy's airplane. One piggy is stuck flying on adagio, another on moderato, and the third on allegro.

Children learn tempo while discovering Machu Picchu in Peru and China. While in China, the artful backgrounds and scenery are made of Chinese paper cuttings. The mix of the flying speeds and locales keep the kids interested. The little critic confirms his interest by enthusiastically retelling the story of the little piggies' flights in different directions. One piggie flies into space. That's it -- nothing more.

Episode #41 from May 2007, ""The Great Sky Race Rematch"" again features ""The William Tell Overture"" with artwork titled ""Whirlpool and Waves at Naruto, Awa Province"" by Utagawa Hiroshige. Rocket enters the Great Sky Race again after winning the previous year's race. Rival Big Jet also enters the race and plays a few nasty tricks on Rocket. The kids use tempo and creativity to overcome barriers that Big Jet puts up for Rocket.

""The Great Sky Race Rematch"" shows how the gang uses creativity to overcome the barriers they run into in the race. It's also a good way to learn how to face adversity. The episode balances all the elements of a good kids' show, including pace that meets their attention spans, strong yet simple storylines, sweetness without sugar overload, and an adventure with a purpose.

The three episodes go well together with the first and last episodes guest starring Big Jet. The second episode teaches tempo and the last episode ties everything together.

Bonus features include a ""Rocket Around the World"" interactive activity, which takes kids on a trip to four locales. However, it's very slow even for adults and not very interactive. Kids use the remote control to pick the right Rocket vehicle for traveling to the different locations. That's all there is to it.

Two videos starring Playhouse Disney's Lou and Lou Safety Patrol cover racing and buckling for safety. Unfortunately, these bonus shorts and ""Rocket Around the World"" don't have closed-captions or English subtitles. Though the bonuses don't offer much, the Little Einsteins fans will watch and enjoy the DVD because they're most interested in the familiar faces on the cover.

The four-year-old Little Einsteins critic sums up his review in one sentence: ""I really like the movie!"" And he watched it again and again and again. The nine-year-old -- who is into the more hardcore shows like SpongeBob Squarepants and Avatar -- even sat with him a couple of times and he wouldn't do that if the show didn't interest him. Little Einsteins: Race for Space earns applause for presenting an enjoyable educational program that parents won't dread watching for the twentieth time. Preview a clip from Race for Space.

I agree that the title of the DVD is a little misleading. I was expecting a space episode but they do briefly go into space in the episode 'Super Fast'. There is one never before seen episode, along with two other episodes. We don't get the Disney Channel, so we're happy with any episodes since we only have seen the ones on DVD.
