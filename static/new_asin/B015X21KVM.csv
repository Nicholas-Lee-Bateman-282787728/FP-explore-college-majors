7453227,5,B015X21KVM,"I have purchased Happy Yoga with Sarah Starr, volumes 3 & 5. I have to say that Sarah is a wonderful teacher with the practice of yoga. Sarah uses a step by step process when introducing the pose, along with wonderful descriptive words that anyone who is new to yoga can understand and thereby obtain benefit from the use of her DVD's. Both of these volumes have been well worth the purchase for my own personal practice at home and therefore highly recommend them! Thank you Sarah Starr!",1257292800,2,488,4.556818181818182

This is my 5th dvd purchased and very excited and pleased with Vol 5.  With each volume of chair yoga I am challenged and it deepens my yoga experience. Sarah's calming voice, the sequence of poses, the locations = perfect!

For people who want to start an exercise program ~ Happy Yoga with Sarah Starr|Chair Yoga is the perfect place to begin.  We have to keep moving to maintain good health.  Chair Yoga is gentle and effective.  You feel energized, refreshed, clears the head cobwebs, and keeps you moving. I am breathing deeper, stronger, feel an inner peace.  I have always had a balance issue so using a chair helps me maintain balance and feel safe while doing yoga.  If you sit a lot ~ why not use Chair Yoga to start moving ~ it only takes 30 minutes to improve your health.

The holiday season will be here soon.  Happy Yoga with Sarah Starr|Chair Yoga is a great gift idea for yourself and for your loved ones.

Thank you Sarah Starr for your amazing yoga videos!  I look forward to purchasing Vol 6!",1470960000,5,1177,4.485849056603773

Her unique style and attention to detail ensure that the viewer is getting the best possible information to perform each pose correctly.  All of this with gorgeous scenery/spectacular videography.  I currently own ten of Sarah's chair yoga videos and look forward to adding more to my collection.  In my opinion, ALL of her yoga videos are the BEST!",1463616000,8,435,4.917808219178082
