8006627,2,B000159EA6,"This video is OK as exercise instruction goes.  As softcore erotica, it's a bit lacking.  The image quality is poor, very grainy.  And there was only one guy who excited me.  The video is divided into sections based on muscle groups (abs, triceps, chest, shoulders) but each section features only one model.  Since I wasn't enthused about most of the men, it was a grind to watch each very long section (except the shoulder portion).

The lower body video is better in my opinion.  Better looking models, and all models are featured in each section.  And the picture quality is better.",1267228800,3,585,4.7227722772277225
