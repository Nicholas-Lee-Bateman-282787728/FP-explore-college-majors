7554169,5,B018QRGNK4,"Nathan Hanighan (Jason Burkey) left Sharon Donahue (Rachele B Smith) to go to school and has never been around her when she needed him for the start. He finds out, she fell for Jeremiah Joelsey  (Ben Davies), his best friend! He gets torn inside, and like most men, does not open to it. With the help of his dad Curtis Hanighan  (Kevin Sorbo), his grandma Nona (Shelley Long) and Miranda Joelsey  (Kelsey Sanders), he learns that he MUST forgive Jeremiah for wronging him. Wren Taylor (Izzy Steel) has an emotional breakdown when Evan Wright (Jack Ramey) bails out on her for the dance. Nathan, knowing Evan, overheard Kara (Brooke Ellis) say Evan caused her that pain by bailing out on her.
Relationships are not perfect, and they have their meltdowns at some point to where the couple wants to split up. Miranda and Nathan have that moment when she gets irate and sad about Jeremiah. She accidentally says because she wasn't thinking clearly, ""It shouldn't be that difficult! I'M over you!"" They come to grips with their behaviors and at the end, Nathan realizes Miranda is a MUCH better woman for him than Sharon and they get married!",1489190400,4,1137,4.732323232323233

7554172,2,B018QRGNK4,The ending WAS the problem. I just cant watch this again. A good movie turned depressing and was hard to quickly turn around and be happy about.,1483747200,,144,4.37037037037037

7554178,4,B018QRGNK4,It is so relevant to what happens in life some times. It brought out many memories.,1473811200,,83,4.25
7554179,5,B018QRGNK4,One of the best movies I have ever watched.  Very real movie with a lot of suspense showing how distracting can unforgiveness be and how long it takes for a godly destiny to take place.  Waiting for the right destiny will be blissfulness beyond belief.,1473465600,3,252,4.5777777777777775
7554180,5,B018QRGNK4,I really like this movie.,1473120000,,25,4.2
7554181,1,B018QRGNK4,Stupid movie. Bad acting. Shelly long was miserable,1472860800,,51,5.5
7554182,3,B018QRGNK4,"This was a light, easy-to-watch movie, for the most part.  Not particularly well-written, it dragged in places and tried to do too much in others.  However, Jason Burkey and Kelsey Sanders do a great job saving it from the often-trite dialogue and making it worth the watch.  One of the cutest parts of the movie was ""Miranda's"" mouthed words to ""Nathan"" during the kiss near the end, though I'm not sure why that was hidden instead clearly spoken as  it added a too-easily-missed charm to the finale.",1472342400,,501,4.724137931034483
7554183,4,B018QRGNK4,"Based on Biblical beliefs: GOD's unending love & forgiveness.  Then, throw in human betrayal, & you get one broken heart.
Wish Kevin Sorbo's role as the dad/widower had been developed more; still a good purchase.",1471046400,4,212,5.057142857142857

7554190,5,B018QRGNK4,Nice family film.,1469232000,,17,5.0
7554191,3,B018QRGNK4,"We rented this movie via the Amazon Prime Video app and had no issues with streaming...

We thought it was cute but pretty cheesy overall. I think I would've loved this as a teenager but as adults, we just thought it was okay.

It was refreshing to watch a clean flick, as there aren't enough out there anymore. So if you're wanting that, you've definitely found it here.

There was a bit of overacting and it was pretty high school aged in general but the story was cute. It had some sweet moments and a good story of forgiveness.

Overall, I would only recommend it if you're looking for something to watch with or for your kids. Hope this helps.",1468713600,3,648,4.375
7554192,5,B018QRGNK4,"This movie was GREAT. Also very relatable because sometimes we all need to learn to LET GO. Sometimes we can hold on to our hurt so tight that we forget how to live or how to move on in life. I definitely know I can use this message from the movie for my life. There have been times where I have allowed things and people from the past to take over my emotions and life and it's good to be reminded that it's unhealthy and just a waste of time. Precious time. Time that we don't have.
Letting go will give you peace, and you will be able to feel and be free. Circumstances and certain situations like that shouldn't define us, or make us stop living, they shouldn't tie or weigh us down. But they do. It's just not worth the time to be angry, it's a waste of time, it's a waste of years, and it's a waste of energy.
I know that for a while in my life I stopped living because I was so hurt, I was angry and upset with people and their choices, and how it had impacted me. But as soon as I said, ""enough is enough, I can't allow this to ruin my life and make me stop living, I have wasted enough time"", I noticed change in myself and I was able to move on. I was tired of being stuck. I believe forgiveness and letting go is the key to true inner happiness and peace, and only through God can we receive forgiveness for our transgressions and sins because we are all sinners in the need of forgiveness. May it be from people we hurt or our Heavenly father in heaven.",1468627200,4,1465,4.037800687285223

7554204,5,B018QRGNK4,"A Place in the Heart deals with strained relationships. If you haven't faced those, you aren't alive. The familiar names do their parts, but Nathan & Miranda do the heavy lifting in the film. The marriage proposal is one of the most creative Ive ever seen. No reviewer has mentioned it yet, BUT DONT MISS the last 4 words of dialog. A whispered sentence in the middle of the last kiss. Those 4 words are the icing on the cake. Have watched many times.",1466380800,9,451,4.380952380952381
