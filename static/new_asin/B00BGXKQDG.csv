5620901,3,B00BGXKQDG,"For those who watched the original FIERCE WIFE series, they very likely enjoyed the give and take that accompanied the changes in the leading characters. Whom would Ah Chen choose after being dumped by her husband? Would it be that now changed and remorseful husband or her new and exciting boyfriend? The series left us in the dark and it was with high expectation that I viewed the sequel: THE FINAL EPISODE. This concluding episode lacks the emotional resonance of the original in that there was no competition displayed between the husband Fan (James Wen) and the boyfriend Lan (Chris Wang). The original included a tearful plea by the husband for a reconciliation with Ah Chen (Sonia Sui). Here the husband returns but he seems to have lost interest in his ex-wife. Instead, he wishes to be there for his daughter. Fan's ex-girlfriend En (Amanda Zhu) makes a brief re-appearance accompanied by her three year old son Oliver, about whom Fan had no previous knowledge. She leaves quickly for America, and there is no clue that he will follow. Further, Ah Chen seems unconcerned when En tells her of Oliver's paternity. Ah Chen has a clear choice: a safe and comfortable re-union with an ex-husband or a new life with an exciting boyfriend. I shall not reveal here her decision but the sequel lacks drama and motivation, a not unexpected event when one considers that the cast had only two hours to put it all together. The charm of the original lay in the slow buildup of character and theme. The fierceness of the wife in the original has here flattened out into a paste pudding.",1407024000,4,1583,4.739130434782608

5620904,3,B00BGXKQDG,i understand with the length of the move it could not go into more details with the other character lives in the past four years however it still could have been better.,1365724800,,169,4.3125
8568345,5,B00BGXKQDG,"This is the ending to this amazing drama. We left off with An Zhen still undecided about her future and who she truly loves. It ended with shaking hands with Lan Tien Wei. I felt that they were a perfect match. To me and a lot of people,we wanted more of an ending. I was happy to discover there was an additional movie for that. But I hesitated because of the price and I have never regretted buying it. I've watched it about 12 times in the last couple years. This DVD does not loose quality over multiple views like some of my other Chinese shows by lesser companies. And has great subtitles but not perfect. Some of the characters names are shortened or slightly different. And you can hear Lan Tien Wei's nickname is different when spoken.
  STORYLINE
  Years have passed since her divorce and she is now a strong independent woman who can take care of herself and her daughter.  She sill hasn't decided that she should or could love again with the same confidence as love doesn't last. Rui Fan is devoted to his daughter and is trying to rebuild his relationship with An Zhen. He realized that he still loves her. Lan Tien Wei has traveled the world and has been faithful to her and loves her unconditionally. He wanted to become a better man for her. As he travels, he sends her amazing postcards of himself  with the beauty that he sees around him. He returns on her birthday, her friend/sister in law rented a hotel room with a surprise stripper.  This is what he walks in on. I loved this. He tells her he wants to settle down, this poor guy is so desperately in love with her and his feelings only got stronger for her. There are awkward true to life scenes in this. Lan Tien Wei getting down to her daughters eye level to talk, it was funny. The daughter supporting the dad trying to win her back. He even bought a new wedding ring, to propose to her again. The ex husband covering up the picture postcards out of jealousy. Lan Tien Wei's jealousy of arriving early in the morning to see her ex husband leave the house and her giving him a lunchbox. Lan Tien Wei proposes to her but she leaves the marriage registration office secretly. There is even a person that she get jealous of too. Wei An shows up with their son Oliver. An Zhen and Lan Tien Wei are both on separate paths now. Who gives up? Who does she choose?  The end is amazing as she crashes the wedding to claim her man. Oh, and the fantasy scenes are amazing. Truly worth your money. They did amazing in such a short movie. If you want to see more of my reviews, click on me (There's a drama for that). I am slowly reviewing my collection of Korean/ Chinese/ Taiwanese dramas and CDs, about 200 of them.  Plus dramas and movies that I have watched but not purchased. I plan to list company with picture and subtitle quality for dramas. If I had to replace it with a better copy who makes it. All CDs will have track list, when written in English, and if there are special features on a dvd set. If a multi region player is needed and if there are subtitles or English spoken in these DVDs. I buy the sets that have the DVDs mostly. I hope my reviews are helpful and that you can avoid bad copies of them with my help.",1526860800,,3194,4.292358803986711

8568349,4,B00BGXKQDG,"It was alright. But it lack something the series had, heart and well rounded characters. If you want the final ending to a great series then this is for you.  If not, don't buy it.  Sorry had to be honest.",1440028800,,205,4.1
8568350,3,B00BGXKQDG,"I ordered the Movie as a follow-up to the original the 23 episodes  I watched on Netflix.  The problem I have, this movie is that it fell short and did not measure up to the great performance of the actors ability in the original episodes.  Since the last episode of the original TV movie sort left us, the viewer, hanging because of the hand shake between Xie An Zhen and Tian Wei I feel that the movie was done in haste for closure.",1436832000,,434,4.204819277108434
8568351,1,B00BGXKQDG,"I give shipping and the seller 5 stars, but the product itself deserves only a one star. I thought the movie would wrap up the loose endings that the drama left behind. Big mistake. The editors of this film should never be allowed near another movie...EVER!  NEVER EVER!! Scenes did not flow or transition smoothly. They literally slapped scenes together. Some scene sequences were so abrupt, I was left thinking, what the heck just happened? Where's the rest of that scene? The movie felt like a long teaser trailer for a second season of the drama. The only good thing about the movie is the happy ending. And the fantasy scene. It was super HOT! ;)",1427846400,2,651,4.612068965517241
