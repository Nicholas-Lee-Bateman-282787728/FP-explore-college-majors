8306009,4,B00077BOTC,Best defensive coaching film i've ever seen...accompying game video in the film left a lot to be desire.  My suggestion.....read the book than watch the video.  It definately cleared it up for me.  The pro game footage was useless.  Very snowy.,1269475200,,244,4.878048780487805
8306010,5,B00077BOTC,"I bought into this hoping to learn more than I would from reading about the 46 and other defensive schemes.  I learned so much and got so excited about this it was amazing.  He talked about how individual positions worked and went into great detail with all the positions and how the players lineup.  He also went a little bit better and not only told you, but could actually show you why it works.  A great video that I keep going back to time and time again.",1222387200,,460,4.252873563218391
