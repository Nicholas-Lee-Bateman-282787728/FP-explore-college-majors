3172708,5,B0017INRFY,"film is awesome, very informative and true to the ""spirit"". i give this film an A++++.",1216080000,,86,4.4375
3172709,3,B0017INRFY,"If you look up US patent number 6,630,507 you will find that it is all about the the medicinal value of cannabis and how it helps prevent and treat a wide variety of diseases including stroke, trauma, auto-immune disorders, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc. The funny thing is, this patent is held by the United States government, and that's the same government that claims that cannabis has no medical value. Unfortunately, there is no mention of this in the documentary.

I would have liked ""Super High Me"" to treat this issue with a little more depth. While the documentary does have interviews with medical cannabis patients, the Federal government's persecution of these patients, their providers and caregivers (even in a state where medical cannabis is legal) is generally glossed over, and virtually nothing is said about the hypocrisy and disinformation that holds the cannabis prohibition in place.

That said, from a purely entertainment point of view, there are funny moments in the film, a few good jokes, and occasionally even some touching human situations, but technically, the film falls short of ""Supersize Me"", in terms of science, videography, and editing.

I'll give Super High Me three stars because because at least it talks about this issue, though ""Waiting to Inhale"" is a much better treatment of the subject.",1215993600,4,1332,5.157407407407407
3172710,1,B0017INRFY,"I bought this movie thinking it would have some great facts along with humor like Totaly Baked does.  It turns out that this movie was not very funny having only a couple funny spots.  And the facts? Hard to say if any of them are true because in the portion when he is OFF weed for 30 days he still seems just as high as when is smoking everyday. Dont get me wrong, i was baked when i watched it. Not Recommended. Totaly Baked by far is 100x better than this movie, unless you just want to watch a guy smoke pot for a whole movie.",1215734400,5,531,4.0
3172711,3,B0017INRFY,"Looking to cash in on the Super Size Me name, while appealing to smokers, this movie had an interesting idea. They failed. The ""comedian"" is boring and comes across as a dolt. The ""testing"" is a sham. the movie sucked more than a new vacuum.

Pass.",1215561600,,248,4.391304347826087
3172712,5,B0017INRFY,"for a couple of reasons.  The political angle is new enough to still be educational for many, at least in terms of what Super High Me reveals about the smoke shops cropping up (couldnt resist) all over California. I definitely learned a couple things. So I liked that.  Plus, Doug is pretty funny in the requisite stand-up footage, and also reveals some real emotion in the ""more serious"" bits.  Comedic confessional political documentary?  I like the genre.  And the flick.  And the Sarah Silverman cameo...pleasantly unexpected.",1215475200,,530,5.104651162790698
3172713,4,B0017INRFY,"It would be too easy to just write off ""Super High Me"" as a stoner flick, for this documentary is both hilarious , poignant, and has some serious political undertones.

Doug Benson is a stand-up comedian from Los Angeles best known for his work in ""The Marijuanalogues"" and VH1's ""Best Week Ever"". In this documentary, he spoofs the concept first introduced in Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me"", by going without marijuana for 30 days, and then smoking marijuana for 30 days.

The most surprising aspect of this film are the two scenes in which DEA agents raid dispenaries in California. California, for those who don't know, allows marijuana to be distributed legally if you have a special card from a certified doctor. For all of the hoopla over State's Rights in the Terri Schavo case, I found it very alarming to watch the Federal Government ignore Californian's State's Rights.

Led by a killer soundtrack, and Doug Benson's wicked humor and amiable personality, ""Super High Me"" is a great, great film.

""High""-ly recommended!

And now a review for all the stoners who glazed over the review above:

""Super High Me"" am excellent...dude!",1214697600,8,1141,4.947643979057592
3172714,4,B0017INRFY,"While there aren't many stand-up comedians that I find to be terribly funny, Doug Benson's experiment with getting high for a month straight provided many chuckles.  More importantly, it provided insight on the movement to expand Medical Marijuana in California and the DEA repression they face.  This film could've easily become a documentary on the Medical Marijuana movement, and hopefully some filmmakers will make a movie that focuses on that struggle.
Benson's 30 days of smoking and eating herb was inspired by the 30 miserable days Morgan Spurlock spent eating fast food in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Size-Me/dp/B0002OXVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Size Me</a>&nbsp;(another film I'd highly recommend).
I especially enjoyed Benson's visits to places like the ""420 Temple"", and a trip he made to Vancouver to visit the ""Prince of Pot"" - Marc Emery.  Emery is a former seed distributor and the editor of the excellent ""Cannabis Culture"" magazine (which isn't available through Amazon, but can be found at most bookstores).

""Super High Me"" also introduces us to some Medical Marijuana patients, including a young woman who first started using it at the age of 17 when she was going through her cancer treatments.  It's a crime that cannabis isn't legally available to anyone who wants it for medicinal, spiritual, or recreational reasons.  Pot is forbidden because big pharmaceutical companies don't have a patent on it.

Both covers have the same DVD inside.. so no need to get the other cover. I mean if your going all in you might as well go ALL IN..right? Thats what this moves does...it goes all in on takeing a punch line to the extreme.

The movie itself as a whole is worth watching again and again.. to catch the parts you missed while laughing over before. This movie is an instant classic in the vein of Cheech and Chong, Half Baked, and other great ""stoner"" flicks...but this movie also gives you some nice nuggets of info along the way as well. So its just more then the average dude gets baked and makes jokes movie...but he does get really really baked so don't worry about that. ;)

Its a great DVD to buy...or puff puff buy for a friend.  ;)",1214438400,2,879,4.965986394557823
3172716,5,B0017INRFY,"So you think it's all gonna be yuks? Nah. It's a look into one man's life and one nation's policies. It's also hilario-donkulous. Why does Doug smoke? How does he get it? How do other people get it? What are the facts and stats involved with medicinal marijuana? When is legal pot illegal? What effect does constant smoking have on one man, and what effects does NOT smoking have? What does 420 mean? All of these questions except for the 420 thing will be answered. This thing is packed with facts and insight and laughs. So see it, dorks!

Unlike Supersize Me, the host isn't photogenic or interesting to watch.

I enjoyed the advocacy for individual liberty and the history of marijuana, but the remainder of the film doesn't justify purchasing this film. A very valid point is raised when a federal officer raids a dealer with an unsigned warrant. In summary, however, I'd rather read about it or rip my fingernails off than sit through Dull Doug's quasi-Demented Trip through Marijuanaland.",1355011200,,720,5.042016806722689

The comedian goes 30 days sober, then 30 days of being high for roughly 18 hours a day; how could it not be funny? However, the film does deal with some more serious issues regarding what is a very serious debate. The intersection between state and federal law is most dramatic portion of the film, with several scenes of raids conducted by the DEA of California marijuana dispensaries. But the ""tests"" that Benson subjects himself to (the SAT, physicals, even psychic analysis) are much more entertaining than anything. Most of the results are to be expected, like his loss of lung capacity and weight gain. It would surprise some to see he did better on the SAT while high, but most people score better the more times they take the test, regardless of mental state.

3172793,4,B0017INRFY,"""Super High Me"" portrays standup comedian Doug Benson's experiment to see what would happen to him if he, a regular smoker of marijuana, went 30 days without smoking it and then go on a continuous binge of marijuana smoking for the next thirty days. Benson makes it no secret that he was at least in part inspired to do this by Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me' in which Spurlock discovers that the effects of 30 days of fast food aren't exactly all that great--it's unhealthy for you. Benson wants to learn if 30 days of abstinence immediately followed by 30 days of marijuana ""immersion"" would have any effects on his mind and body. Doug also knows that the effects of smoking marijuana can be distinctly different for different people. Some tolerate it well and others don't. Doug will try to continue his work as a standup comedian while he goes through the entire two month experiment. All in all, Doug's trial remains really interesting; I never felt bored or itchy for the movie to end. It all flows well and the cinematography is terrific. We get brief comments from other comedians who know Doug, too.

Predictably, it was tough for Doug to take himself off marijuana as he is a routine smoker; we see him driving down the street in his car and he not so jokingly states that everything reminds him of marijuana--even the green traffic lights at intersections! However, Doug does an admirable job of holding it all together and he doesn't cheat--he's committed to his experiment. Doug also takes a trial SAT; a test to see if he's a psychic and he meets with both a psychologist and his internist to get tested once while he's completely sober and another time when he's rather stoned indeed.

The outcome is rather interesting; and I don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave a good deal of that part out. We do get a basic introduction to how Californians were able to vote their way into the legal use of medical marijuana within the state; although we also see conflicts arising when federal agents and federal law enforcement step in to close a store that sells marijuana legally in California because the government at the federal level does not allow marijuana to be legally sold. We also lean that the stores selling marijuana, which are called ""dispensaries,"" are growing in number at a fairly good pace in California at the time this film was made. We get a brief look at the first legal dispensary in California; and I really like that we meet a couple of people who use marijuana for legitimate medical reasons when their doctors have given them a special type of prescription that they can fill at a dispensary.

Unfortunately, the DVD comes with no extras--unless you count the theatrical trailer as a bonus extra. I would have liked a running commentary from the director and/or Doug Benson himself; but this is lacking and that's a disappointment.

If you want to study the effects of marijuana on people and the history of marijuana, this film is probably one of the better places to start. I commend Doug Benson for putting his experiment on film for us to watch and ponder. The footage of Doug doing his standup routines gives the movie extra flavor that works well, too.",1255219200,,3202,4.671985815602837

The truth is, he's not really that funny; his comedy acts, which was 75% of the movie, was the worste part. If I were making this movie I would have focused much more on the science. I did think that the movie was informative in a way and I must give Doug some credit for being creative enough to think about testing his psychosis abilities before and after he was high.

3172798,1,B0017INRFY,"This is a ridiculous movie that attempts to trivialize the negative impact of habitual (or even recreational) marijuana usage.  The tests are meaningless, afford no control group(s) protections, no objective and independent analysis of findings, and are worthless as they are biased by Doug Benson.  He uses comedy to disarm the material, using the laugh factor to perpetrate a fraud, which is not a new tactic when trying to overcome credible studies that don't fit your personal desires.  How will this endorsement of an illegal drug help the cause of the common man?  How do the comparisons of this `entertainer' relate to the audience?

No one in the viewing audience will have the luxury of traveling around, getting high, and trying to make people laugh as a profession or lifestyle.  Doug Benson doesn't have a comparable lifestyle or profession to 99% of the American public, and some would say he doesn't have a job at all. He has no job conformity requirements to adhere to such as defined work hours, dress code, language, or proven professional capacity - he's basically a professional slacker who gets through life by making people laugh (bet you knew a few of them in high school).  Isn't that one of the examples of the negative side of marijuana use?  Perhaps that's why Doug Benson seems so well adapted to a life of marijuana use - the negative impact on life success for the average marijuana user is exactly what he needs to be successful. So for the other 99.9% of marijuana users who can't work as professional slackers, they should follow his example?

 Regardless of how humorous the comedy, or the validation of the pot-heads who feel vindicated by this movie, it really only serves to undermine factual studies that show the true impact of both short-term and long-term marijuana use.  It also endorses criminal drug use that involves the worst type of criminal element in America, costs countless lives (both criminal and innocent victims), and tarnishes the memory of good American's who have given their lives trying to make America drug free. What's next, a movie showing how Doug Benson can consume copius quantities of alcohol while both his manual dexterity and mental acuity improve, vindicating all the drunk drivers out there?  It's just another disingenuous look at drug use, and I fear that our media oriented youth will find it all too easy to follow Benson's example over the teachings of parents, academia, and social systems.

Watch this, and then watch `Generation Rx' and note the parallels of escapism and drug use to create or modify perceptions of normalcy and conformity - and in the end someone is always making a huge profit.",1244246400,6,2675,4.917777777777777

3172800,4,B0017INRFY,"In 2004 Morgan Spurlock created a documentary about the effects eating McDonalds has on your body. He spent an entire month consuming 3 square meals of nothing but McDonalds fast food and opened up everyone's eyes to the damage they can do to their body. Fast forward 3 years and we get another documentary only this time it's with comedian Doug Benson as he tokes for 30 days straight. Even if you aren't a pot smoker you may still want to check this one out for a hilarious yet informative journey into the world of canibus.

Doug Benson prior to this film was a pot smoker for 17 years. The idea came all as part of a joke in one of his stand-up acts where he said he should create a movie called Super High Me after the success of Super Size Me. Upon further thought he decided it was more then a joke and an actual idea. He gathered some friends and made it happen to expose pot use in a more enjoyable comedic light then previous documentaries in the past. Aside from just laughs the film really touches on making people aware of the benefits of medical marijuana use in many sick patients. You also get a look at the dispensaries in California and the fight they go through with law enforcement.

Super High Me is really a solid documentary on a serious debate going on in our country today. It doesn't focus too much on the current state of making it legal but does provide a lot of information you may not be aware of. This one will definately rank high among smokers but those who don't smoke would still find it really funny and insightful.",1242604800,4,1551,4.3633217993079585

But being a non-Californian I really had no idea of what some of the medical dispensaries looked like before watching this video. From what I saw what's going on there is pretty intriguing. Further, one of the reasons we should treasure federalism is because of situations like the one highlighted here (in the film) where the DEA overrides the local civic authorities and starts busting up shops. Those scenes were a disgrace. I hope people see this film and realize the necessity of decreasing the size of the federal government in the hopes of preserving all of our liberties.

While Benson's summary of the film is accurate, it is much more than just that.  It examines the movement to expand medical marijuana use in California, and the opposition they face from the DEA.
 This movie fulfills its role as a documentary while entertaining its audience. You'll get a chuckle from Benson's commentary on his project. The results from his physical and mental tests will probably surprise you too, as will the insight into the marijuana community.
 While the movie is informative, I feel it could have gone a little farther into the history of the drug and the movement for its legalization. The test of the effects of marijuana on ESP may also have some people taking this movie a little less seriously.

I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I think that all people, pot-smokers or not, should watch this movie, as it debunks many of the myths concerning pot use that are prevalent today. Most people know that government propaganda usually over-exaggerates risks, but few people know just how safe marijuana really is. This movie is an eye-opener.

That being said, I am very, very, very disappointed with Doug Benson's performance. If you watch closely (or, hell, not even that closely...), you will notice that he almost never inhales. Not once during the movie did I see him inhale. It was obviously a gimmick, and I really resent the fact this man was chosen for this role. He gives a bad name to pot-smokers. I doubt he was even high for the majority of the movie...

Great movie. Would have been much better if the main character actually did what he was claiming to do, but the message was left unharmed, and that was the point of the movie.",1225152000,2,1029,4.586956521739131

This was my first introduction to Doug Benson and I found him stealing almost every scene, picture in your mind his Mother while she waits for him and you'll get an idea what I'm talking about.  The science, the honesty, and the realization that a standup comic could probably make that lifestyle work for him, all make this movie a top pick for anyone of the Ganja variety.

Most of the content about legislation was common knowledge so I didn't learn anything knew.  The most interesting part to me was the closing of legal, medical cannabis stores in California due to discrepancies between federal and state laws regarding marijuana.  In the movie they show cannabis stores in California being shut down by the DEA (federal officials) despite the state law which has legalizing it.  It was very shocking to see stores get closed down at random and have their patient records as well as their supply of marijuana confiscated and never returned even after they were legally allowed to reopen.

3172816,1,B0017INRFY,"Morgan Spurlock perhaps did the world a bit of a service when he released his film  Super Size Me . The film sought to show the negative effects upon the body a thirty day diet of fast food would cause in an effort to show the somewhat obvious effects of the fast food that society consumes on an amazing level.

Though perhaps the outcome was already known, the film did open some viewers' eyes to different aspects of the fast food nation that we live in and sought to provide information as well as humor all in one.

Just as music has Weird Al Yankovich belting out spoofs of pop music lyrics and songs, the world now has a Weird Al of the documentary industry. And I am pretty sure you were all just hoping for just that.

Thanks to Doug Benson, a stand up comedian who is perhaps best known for his title as Stoner of The Year, we now have a spoof of Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me in Benson's release Super High Me .

Appropriately released on 4/20 of 2008, Super High Me is Benson's attempt to provide a humorous look not at fast food but instead marijuana. While Spurlock's documentary attempted to detail for the masses that eat fast food the effects on the body that fast food has, Benson instead decides to try and convince those perhaps that do not smoke pot into believing that the effects of pot really are not all that bad.

But aside the issue of whether it is right or wrong to take a little toke here and there, what Benson does is live thirty days completely marijuana free and then go on a thirty day binge of smoking marijuana again.

Benson, who for years has sort of been a cult favorite amongst stoners across America, is no stranger to marijuana so perhaps a mere thirty day purge and then binge for him would be completely different than someone who has never smoked pot before and then they went on a binge. One would imagine that perhaps the results might be different.

There is not much scientific evidence supporting the film and most of the experts that are interviewed are all familiar with Benson. The doctor that performs a post-purge and post-binge evaluation is an admitted former pot smoker and familiar with Benson's medical history so one might be left wondering whether or not an impartial doctor might have been a better selection.

Much of the film shows Benson doing stand up comedy while under the influence of marijuana. Maybe it is just me, but a guy doing the same jokes over and over again about his daily run in with marijuana simply seems to lose its appeal after about 5 minutes. Most of the humor that is highlighted is more reminiscent of that stoner kid in middle school no one hung our with rather than being solid comedy of a national stand up comedian.

Directed by Michael Blieden, one can assume that most of the brainpower, or lack thereof that went into this film came from either Benson or a room full of hippies blowing pot smoke in one another's faces. While certainly the premise was present for a potentially interesting documentary take on the marijuana fad that has swept the nation, the film all in all leaves the viewer more with a feeling of the munchies for another, better film to watch.

Super High Me is nothing more than a bunch of smoke being blown in your face while you are being told that, ""...this is a really good movie."" Super High Me certainly is not the good stuff. You, my friends, have just been sold some really bad stuff.",1216425600,13,3413,4.471061093247588

Unfortunately, there is no mention of this in the documentary.

I would have liked ""Super High Me"" to treat this issue with a little more depth. While the documentary does have interviews with medical cannabis patients, the Federal government's persecution of these patients, their providers and caregivers (even in a state where medical cannabis is legal) is generally glossed over, and virtually nothing is said about the hypocrisy and disinformation that holds the cannabis prohibition in place.

That said, from a purely entertainment point of view, there are funny moments in the film, a few good jokes, and occasionally even some touching human situations, but technically, the film falls short of ""Supersize Me"", in terms of science, videography, and editing.

Doug Benson is a stand-up comedian from Los Angeles best known for his work in ""The Marijuanalogues"" and VH1's ""Best Week Ever"". In this documentary, he spoofs the concept first introduced in Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me"", by going without marijuana for 30 days, and then smoking marijuana for 30 days.

The most surprising aspect of this film are the two scenes in which DEA agents raid dispenaries in California. California, for those who don't know, allows marijuana to be distributed legally if you have a special card from a certified doctor. For all of the hoopla over State's Rights in the Terri Schavo case, I found it very alarming to watch the Federal Government ignore Californian's State's Rights.

Benson's 30 days of smoking and eating herb was inspired by the 30 miserable days Morgan Spurlock spent eating fast food in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Size-Me/dp/B0002OXVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Size Me</a>&nbsp;(another film I'd highly recommend).
I especially enjoyed Benson's visits to places like the ""420 Temple"", and a trip he made to Vancouver to visit the ""Prince of Pot"" - Marc Emery.  Emery is a former seed distributor and the editor of the excellent ""Cannabis Culture"" magazine (which isn't available through Amazon, but can be found at most bookstores).

""Super High Me"" also introduces us to some Medical Marijuana patients, including a young woman who first started using it at the age of 17 when she was going through her cancer treatments.  It's a crime that cannabis isn't legally available to anyone who wants it for medicinal, spiritual, or recreational reasons.  Pot is forbidden because big pharmaceutical companies don't have a patent on it.

People who want to explore more of the political, social and economic issues involving marijuana will want to check out DVDs like:

Both covers have the same DVD inside.. so no need to get the other cover. I mean if your going all in you might as well go ALL IN..right? Thats what this moves does...it goes all in on takeing a punch line to the extreme.

The movie itself as a whole is worth watching again and again.. to catch the parts you missed while laughing over before. This movie is an instant classic in the vein of Cheech and Chong, Half Baked, and other great ""stoner"" flicks...but this movie also gives you some nice nuggets of info along the way as well. So its just more then the average dude gets baked and makes jokes movie...but he does get really really baked so don't worry about that. ;)

Its a great DVD to buy...or puff puff buy for a friend.  ;)",1214438400,2,879,4.965986394557823

What effect does constant smoking have on one man, and what effects does NOT smoking have? What does 420 mean? All of these questions except for the 420 thing will be answered.

Unlike Supersize Me, the host isn't photogenic or interesting to watch.

I enjoyed the advocacy for individual liberty and the history of marijuana, but the remainder of the film doesn't justify purchasing this film.

In summary, however, I'd rather read about it or rip my fingernails off than sit through Dull Doug's quasi-Demented Trip through Marijuanaland.",1355011200,,720,5.042016806722689

The comedian goes 30 days sober, then 30 days of being high for roughly 18 hours a day; how could it not be funny? However, the film does deal with some more serious issues regarding what is a very serious debate. The intersection between state and federal law is most dramatic portion of the film, with several scenes of raids conducted by the DEA of California marijuana dispensaries. But the ""tests"" that Benson subjects himself to (the SAT, physicals, even psychic analysis) are much more entertaining than anything. Most of the results are to be expected, like his loss of lung capacity and weight gain. It would surprise some to see he did better on the SAT while high, but most people score better the more times they take the test, regardless of mental state. In the end the film is sure to become a cult classic. Be prepared to laugh!",1313452800,,1005,4.748571428571428

3407290,4,B0017INRFY,"""Super High Me"" portrays standup comedian Doug Benson's experiment to see what would happen to him if he, a regular smoker of marijuana, went 30 days without smoking it and then go on a continuous binge of marijuana smoking for the next thirty days. Benson makes it no secret that he was at least in part inspired to do this by Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me' in which Spurlock discovers that the effects of 30 days of fast food aren't exactly all that great--it's unhealthy for you. Benson wants to learn if 30 days of abstinence immediately followed by 30 days of marijuana ""immersion"" would have any effects on his mind and body. Doug also knows that the effects of smoking marijuana can be distinctly different for different people. Some tolerate it well and others don't. Doug will try to continue his work as a standup comedian while he goes through the entire two month experiment. All in all, Doug's trial remains really interesting; I never felt bored or itchy for the movie to end. It all flows well and the cinematography is terrific. We get brief comments from other comedians who know Doug, too.

Predictably, it was tough for Doug to take himself off marijuana as he is a routine smoker; we see him driving down the street in his car and he not so jokingly states that everything reminds him of marijuana--even the green traffic lights at intersections! However, Doug does an admirable job of holding it all together and he doesn't cheat--he's committed to his experiment. Doug also takes a trial SAT; a test to see if he's a psychic and he meets with both a psychologist and his internist to get tested once while he's completely sober and another time when he's rather stoned indeed.

The outcome is rather interesting; and I don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave a good deal of that part out. We do get a basic introduction to how Californians were able to vote their way into the legal use of medical marijuana within the state; although we also see conflicts arising when federal agents and federal law enforcement step in to close a store that sells marijuana legally in California because the government at the federal level does not allow marijuana to be legally sold. We also lean that the stores selling marijuana, which are called ""dispensaries,"" are growing in number at a fairly good pace in California at the time this film was made. We get a brief look at the first legal dispensary in California; and I really like that we meet a couple of people who use marijuana for legitimate medical reasons when their doctors have given them a special type of prescription that they can fill at a dispensary.

Unfortunately, the DVD comes with no extras--unless you count the theatrical trailer as a bonus extra. I would have liked a running commentary from the director and/or Doug Benson himself; but this is lacking and that's a disappointment.

If you want to study the effects of marijuana on people and the history of marijuana, this film is probably one of the better places to start. I commend Doug Benson for putting his experiment on film for us to watch and ponder. The footage of Doug doing his standup routines gives the movie extra flavor that works well, too.",1255219200,,3202,4.671985815602837

3407292,2,B0017INRFY,"This movie was mediocre to say the least. I love the idea of someone trying to get high for 30 days and making a scientific experiment out of it but I think Doug should have just stuck with that. The truth is, he's not really that funny; his comedy acts, which was 75% of the movie, was the worste part. If I were making this movie I would have focused much more on the science. I did think that the movie was informative in a way and I must give Doug some credit for being creative enough to think about testing his psychosis abilities before and after he was high. Overall though, I would only recommend this movie to people who are truely interested in marijuana and I would also say to try at all costs to rent it because you probably won't want to watch it more than once.",1253059200,2,777,4.1866666666666665

George Carlin was a great stoner, uh, I mean comedian, but it was an active participation in the humor. Benson seems to miss this point in his haze of repetitive marijuana jokes. Either put down the bong and write better material or start smoking/vaping some better stuff to increase your creativity. As for now Doug, you're boring!

3407295,1,B0017INRFY,"This is a ridiculous movie that attempts to trivialize the negative impact of habitual (or even recreational) marijuana usage.  The tests are meaningless, afford no control group(s) protections, no objective and independent analysis of findings, and are worthless as they are biased by Doug Benson.  He uses comedy to disarm the material, using the laugh factor to perpetrate a fraud, which is not a new tactic when trying to overcome credible studies that don't fit your personal desires.  How will this endorsement of an illegal drug help the cause of the common man?  How do the comparisons of this `entertainer' relate to the audience?

No one in the viewing audience will have the luxury of traveling around, getting high, and trying to make people laugh as a profession or lifestyle.  Doug Benson doesn't have a comparable lifestyle or profession to 99% of the American public, and some would say he doesn't have a job at all. He has no job conformity requirements to adhere to such as defined work hours, dress code, language, or proven professional capacity - he's basically a professional slacker who gets through life by making people laugh (bet you knew a few of them in high school).  Isn't that one of the examples of the negative side of marijuana use?  Perhaps that's why Doug Benson seems so well adapted to a life of marijuana use - the negative impact on life success for the average marijuana user is exactly what he needs to be successful. So for the other 99.9% of marijuana users who can't work as professional slackers, they should follow his example?

 Regardless of how humorous the comedy, or the validation of the pot-heads who feel vindicated by this movie, it really only serves to undermine factual studies that show the true impact of both short-term and long-term marijuana use.  It also endorses criminal drug use that involves the worst type of criminal element in America, costs countless lives (both criminal and innocent victims), and tarnishes the memory of good American's who have given their lives trying to make America drug free. What's next, a movie showing how Doug Benson can consume copius quantities of alcohol while both his manual dexterity and mental acuity improve, vindicating all the drunk drivers out there?  It's just another disingenuous look at drug use, and I fear that our media oriented youth will find it all too easy to follow Benson's example over the teachings of parents, academia, and social systems.

Watch this, and then watch `Generation Rx' and note the parallels of escapism and drug use to create or modify perceptions of normalcy and conformity - and in the end someone is always making a huge profit.",1244246400,6,2675,4.917777777777777

3407297,4,B0017INRFY,"In 2004 Morgan Spurlock created a documentary about the effects eating McDonalds has on your body. He spent an entire month consuming 3 square meals of nothing but McDonalds fast food and opened up everyone's eyes to the damage they can do to their body. Fast forward 3 years and we get another documentary only this time it's with comedian Doug Benson as he tokes for 30 days straight. Even if you aren't a pot smoker you may still want to check this one out for a hilarious yet informative journey into the world of canibus.

Doug Benson prior to this film was a pot smoker for 17 years. The idea came all as part of a joke in one of his stand-up acts where he said he should create a movie called Super High Me after the success of Super Size Me. Upon further thought he decided it was more then a joke and an actual idea. He gathered some friends and made it happen to expose pot use in a more enjoyable comedic light then previous documentaries in the past. Aside from just laughs the film really touches on making people aware of the benefits of medical marijuana use in many sick patients. You also get a look at the dispensaries in California and the fight they go through with law enforcement.

Super High Me is really a solid documentary on a serious debate going on in our country today. It doesn't focus too much on the current state of making it legal but does provide a lot of information you may not be aware of. This one will definately rank high among smokers but those who don't smoke would still find it really funny and insightful.",1242604800,4,1551,4.3633217993079585

3407299,5,B0017INRFY,"This documentary was far more entertaining than it was educational. It really didn't focus too much on the history of marijuana usage and didn't analyze the prospects of future legalization (they're dim). But being a non-Californian I really had no idea of what some of the medical dispensaries looked like before watching this video. From what I saw what's going on there is pretty intriguing. Further, one of the reasons we should treasure federalism is because of situations like the one highlighted here (in the film) where the DEA overrides the local civic authorities and starts busting up shops. Those scenes were a disgrace. I hope people see this film and realize the necessity of decreasing the size of the federal government in the hopes of preserving all of our liberties.

3407302,4,B0017INRFY,"The documentary Super High Me is described by its star, comedian Doug Benson, as ""Super Size Me with weed instead of Mc Donald's."" The film follows Benson as he stops smoking marijuana for 30 days, and then smokes it for 30 days while examining the effects on his mind and body. While Benson's summary of the film is accurate, it is much more than just that.  It examines the movement to expand medical marijuana use in California, and the opposition they face from the DEA.
 This movie fulfills its role as a documentary while entertaining its audience. You'll get a chuckle from Benson's commentary on his project. The results from his physical and mental tests will probably surprise you too, as will the insight into the marijuana community.
 While the movie is informative, I feel it could have gone a little farther into the history of the drug and the movement for its legalization. The test of the effects of marijuana on ESP may also have some people taking this movie a little less seriously.
 Super High Me is a fun and informative movie for anyone, not just fans of stoner comedies (although they would love this movie as well.)",1227571200,3,1140,4.685

3407304,5,B0017INRFY,"I just finished watching this movie, and my next course of action is to buy it. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I think that all people, pot-smokers or not, should watch this movie, as it debunks many of the myths concerning pot use that are prevalent today. Most people know that government propaganda usually over-exaggerates risks, but few people know just how safe marijuana really is. This movie is an eye-opener.

That being said, I am very, very, very disappointed with Doug Benson's performance. If you watch closely (or, hell, not even that closely...), you will notice that he almost never inhales. Not once during the movie did I see him inhale. It was obviously a gimmick, and I really resent the fact this man was chosen for this role. He gives a bad name to pot-smokers. I doubt he was even high for the majority of the movie...

Great movie. Would have been much better if the main character actually did what he was claiming to do, but the message was left unharmed, and that was the point of the movie.",1225152000,2,1029,4.586956521739131

3407306,4,B0017INRFY,"While this movie certainly lacks certain production value qualities the base idea is a good one.  Comedian Doug Benson, after watching 'Super Size Me' writes a joke about how he would like to do his own version called... 'Super High Me.'  As it turns out someone in the audience thought it was a decent idea and there you have it, a movie.

While not of the same stunning conclusionary aspects of Super Size Me Benson's travels through 30 days of sobriety followed by 30 days of smoking marijuana consistently for the entirety of his day.

This was my first introduction to Doug Benson and I found him stealing almost every scene, picture in your mind his Mother while she waits for him and you'll get an idea what I'm talking about.  The science, the honesty, and the realization that a standup comic could probably make that lifestyle work for him, all make this movie a top pick for anyone of the Ganja variety.  You will learn a little bit about the effects of marijuana on both the body and memory recall, as well as a bit of psuedoscience testing psychic ability.

Overall a very funny film but enjoy what there is to be said the various ironies throughout.  If you pick this up expecting it to be well crafted as a piece of film you will be sorely disappointed.",1222992000,5,1268,4.506550218340611

My review is basically that the topic was solid but Doug didn't follow it through. It's like writting a thesis paper and having a strong introduction and not enough information in the body of the paper.  He could have done a lot more simply by giving more facts about marijuana and it's use.

3407309,2,B0017INRFY,"Doug Benson is a funny comedian but I didn't find him to be very funny in this movie.  I think he got stoned beyond the point of being funny most of the 30 days he was high.  Most of the content about legislation was common knowledge so I didn't learn anything knew.  The most interesting part to me was the closing of legal, medical cannabis stores in California due to discrepancies between federal and state laws regarding marijuana.  In the movie they show cannabis stores in California being shut down by the DEA (federal officials) despite the state law which has legalizing it.  It was very shocking to see stores get closed down at random and have their patient records as well as their supply of marijuana confiscated and never returned even after they were legally allowed to reopen.  It really shows the holes in the legal system of the U.S.  Other than that, I think the concept of the movie had a lot of potential but was neither funny nor informative for the most part.",1217289600,5,983,4.551136363636363

3407313,1,B0017INRFY,"Morgan Spurlock perhaps did the world a bit of a service when he released his film  Super Size Me . The film sought to show the negative effects upon the body a thirty day diet of fast food would cause in an effort to show the somewhat obvious effects of the fast food that society consumes on an amazing level.

Though perhaps the outcome was already known, the film did open some viewers' eyes to different aspects of the fast food nation that we live in and sought to provide information as well as humor all in one.

Just as music has Weird Al Yankovich belting out spoofs of pop music lyrics and songs, the world now has a Weird Al of the documentary industry. And I am pretty sure you were all just hoping for just that.

Thanks to Doug Benson, a stand up comedian who is perhaps best known for his title as Stoner of The Year, we now have a spoof of Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me in Benson's release Super High Me .

Appropriately released on 4/20 of 2008, Super High Me is Benson's attempt to provide a humorous look not at fast food but instead marijuana. While Spurlock's documentary attempted to detail for the masses that eat fast food the effects on the body that fast food has, Benson instead decides to try and convince those perhaps that do not smoke pot into believing that the effects of pot really are not all that bad.

But aside the issue of whether it is right or wrong to take a little toke here and there, what Benson does is live thirty days completely marijuana free and then go on a thirty day binge of smoking marijuana again.

Benson, who for years has sort of been a cult favorite amongst stoners across America, is no stranger to marijuana so perhaps a mere thirty day purge and then binge for him would be completely different than someone who has never smoked pot before and then they went on a binge. One would imagine that perhaps the results might be different.

There is not much scientific evidence supporting the film and most of the experts that are interviewed are all familiar with Benson. The doctor that performs a post-purge and post-binge evaluation is an admitted former pot smoker and familiar with Benson's medical history so one might be left wondering whether or not an impartial doctor might have been a better selection.

Much of the film shows Benson doing stand up comedy while under the influence of marijuana. Maybe it is just me, but a guy doing the same jokes over and over again about his daily run in with marijuana simply seems to lose its appeal after about 5 minutes. Most of the humor that is highlighted is more reminiscent of that stoner kid in middle school no one hung our with rather than being solid comedy of a national stand up comedian.

Directed by Michael Blieden, one can assume that most of the brainpower, or lack thereof that went into this film came from either Benson or a room full of hippies blowing pot smoke in one another's faces. While certainly the premise was present for a potentially interesting documentary take on the marijuana fad that has swept the nation, the film all in all leaves the viewer more with a feeling of the munchies for another, better film to watch.

Super High Me is nothing more than a bunch of smoke being blown in your face while you are being told that, ""...this is a really good movie."" Super High Me certainly is not the good stuff. You, my friends, have just been sold some really bad stuff.",1216425600,13,3413,4.471061093247588
