2299419,3,B0009MAO3W,"Out of all the Ghibli films released so far in the United States, this is by far the strangest. At least to American eyes; the tanukis are familiar to Japanese audiences, and this film is steeped in Japanese folklore and Japanese history.

Disney, releasing Ghibli's work stateside, has done its best to translate this odd film. And believe me, they had their work cut out for them! This film is nothing like Ghibli's best-known work, Spirited Away. Because Spirited Away dealt with universal themes like family, overcoming hardship, and childhood fears of abandonment, the story remains gripping despite the odd cultural milieu of a Japanese bathhouse. But Pom Poko leans so heavily on culture that it's jarring stateside, even to diehards like me who know the culture.

Both the original Japanese version, with subtitles, and the English dub is on the same disk. The English version is heavily Americanized - which just this once, really helps. In one example out of many, in the English version, one of the animals says that he feels like Rip van Winkle, while in the original Japanese version, he mentions Urashima Taro - the Japanese equivalent.

Two other noteworthy points about the translation. These creatures are called ""raccoons"" throughout the movie. However, they're actually tanuki, an animal native to Japan that (if you're a scientist) is more closely related to a dog than a raccoon. But to lay people, they're more like raccoons in all other respects - appearance, behavior, diet, and the fact that they're considered pranksters (just like raccoons in Native American myth). So it makes sense that the Disney release calls them raccoons - for all intents and purposes, they are.

More interestingly, in Japanese myth, tanuki are said to have giant testicles with magical properties. This is shown in Pom Poko - although the English-language version euphemistically refers to the scrotum as a ""raccoon pouch."" If you have small children in the home, they might not notice that when the tanuki go into battle, the part of them that magically expands looks a lot like the testicles. And if they're old enough to notice, they're old enough to deal with it.

Forgive me if I haven't even got around to descibing the story yet. That's because (at least to me) watching the film is a lot like plowing through this review - there's a lot you have to deal with before you're ready to delve into the story itself.

Pom Poko shows how the tanuki deal with the loss of their forests as humans turn their beloved homes into concrete suburbs. They try to fight back, but despite a few victories here and there, they're overwhelmed, and many of them die in the process.

The story is a fascinating combination of wacky humor, poignant drama and even nature documentary. It's a beautiful film to watch, although it does take some getting used to. The Americanization really does help.

On another note, it would have been nice if the DVD extras had included a primer on the myths surrounding the tanuki, and the animals themselves. No such luck, though. Fortunately, information on the animals (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus) is readily available on the Internet.

I would recommend this movie ONLY for anyone who is already a fan of Japanese animation and Studio Ghibli in particular. For those who are just starting out, I would recommend just about any other Ghibli film instead of this one. There are many to choose from: The Cat Returns, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, and Spirited Away are just a few.",1124150400,24,3522,4.915824915824916
2299420,4,B0009MAO3W,"Pom Poko.  I would like to save a lot of people a lot of letter paper that would otherwise be used to send complaints to Disney about this film:  If you don't like the thought of your children watching a film where a raccoon can inflate his scrotum large enough to obscure the windscreen of a lorry, you really do not want to buy this film.

On the other hand, if you can accept that in Japan these creatures are thought of as having special powers to shape-shift at will (hence numerous well-endowed Tanuki statues dotted about the Japanese landscape) and that the whole testicle/shape-shifting thing is just treated as a matter-of-fact traditional belief over there (unlike in the west where the population would be 50% giggling and 50% writing letters of complaint), there is a good two-hour film here with jokes, romance, action and an unexpected complexity and warmth.  Some imagery such as in the parade may scare some small children though, and anyone who believes that those things really are 'pouches' (as they are referred to in the US dub) needs a quick chat with their doctor.

Do not think however that everything will make sense - as mentioned, the film draws heavily on eastern folklore and has bhuddist/shinto symbolism everywhere.  The English dub is pretty good given the subject matter but there are a couple of bits that probably will confuse people simply because of the culture clash.  Overall though its pretty coherent, and the subtitles do include a literal Japanese translation option this time.

Extras-wise the DVD is let down - I don't know if anyone looks for more than a few seconds at the second storyboard disks rendering them pretty obsolete, but also unlike the other Ghibli releases, this one has no 'Behind the Microphone' either, or any featurettes translated from the Japanese like Nausicaa and Spirited Away had.  You get a couple of the original trailers and thats about it - which is why this review dropped a star.",1124064000,7,1957,4.817910447761194
2299421,5,B0009MAO3W,"i have this movie on japanese laserdisc.

this is my favourite studio ghibli film. i lived on the outskirts of a japanese city while i was a child, during the ten years we lived there the neighborhood changed from 3/4 fields of crops to 3/4 private homes, this film resonates with me in way that Miyazaki's more fantastic ecology films don't, tho Totoro has many familiar sights in it.

like the previous reviewer i thought this film would run afoul of the MPAA rating system and american puritanical tradition. i'll be blunt. anyone who has seen a ceramic tanuki knows they have huge testicles.  in the film they use them as weapons, literally.

in one scene the old tanuki teaching the younger ones the art of transforming, informs them the mat that they are all sitting on is his transformed testicles.  in another a tanuki swings his scrotum with his hands like a sack of bowling balls in a fight.

it's as sexual as the bath scene in Totoro(not at all), still i never thoght this movie could get a PG in america.

not sure but, i believe the japanese tried to enter this film in the best foreign film catagory in the oscars. it deserved it as much as the Incredibles did.",1120348800,6,1176,4.492957746478873
2299422,5,B0009MAO3W,"I am frankly astonished (and pleased) that Disney is actually bringing this strange, complex, wonderful film out in the US.  It's a very sophisticated look at how societies balance (or not) urban development and the natural world while touching on issues of ecology, displacement of aboriginal populations, and even terrorism.  It's also a very entertaining parody of historical documentaries on TV (the pompous Japanese title is: ""Heisei-era Raccoon War Pom Poko""). I can't wait to see what Disney does about the male Tanukis' magically transforming, er..., parts, since I believe their deal with Ghibli doesn't allow edits.",1119916800,8,625,5.43298969072165

2299460,5,B0009MAO3W,"Based on Japanese folklore, magical raccoons with the ability to shape-shift inhabit a forest. They mostly live a carefree life. However, their peace is threatened when humans decide to start leveling the forest to make way for a new town. The raccoons find that their home is being destroyed and start wondering what to do about it. They start to hone their shape-shifting skills and try to stave off the human incursion.

In the English dub, the creatures are called ""raccoons"" which is a simplification of the original name ""tanuki."" Indeed, overall this movie is heavily influenced by folklore surrounding the tanuki and contains many other references to Japanese culture that may be lost to a western viewer, including myself. However, even though every reference may not be understood, the main story of the movie is easy enough to grasp. I enjoyed this film with its trademark Ghibli excellence in animation and some good humor along the way. It may be a little bizarre to some people, but it is a good movie nonetheless.

The bonus features on this set are rather light which consists of some trailers and the original storyboards.

2299464,2,B0009MAO3W,"I have been waiting years to see this movie. With so many great reviews, I was very excited to finally see it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. This is the first Studio Ghibli movie I have not enjoyed. It takes place in the real world, with the forest being leveled for a housing development. I had a hard time buying the idea of raccoons with magical powers.

The shift of animation styles was very jarring for me. The raccoons started out realistic, then turned very cartoonish, and then turned what I can only describe as sloppy. It reminded me of when I went to art school. Someone would be too lazy to do an assignment, and turned in a half finished project. The instructor would critique the work as sloppy.

To top it off, I found the story to be boring at times, and had a hard time staying awake for it. Having said that, there were moments that were very interesting, and at times the animation was everything you would expect from Studio Ghibli. In the end this movie was too uneven for my tastes, both in style and substance. This movie was not what I would have expected from a studio that has given us so many classic animated features.",1449532800,,1157,4.452830188679245
2299465,2,B0009MAO3W,"I will admit that I have always loved Pom Poko and I recently just bought the Blu-Ray of it because I enjoyed it so much. But when I watched the Japanese Blu-Ray version of it, I noticed that something was off with the English subtitles. It had the subtitles, but they only showed the subtitles for the English version of the movie. They didn't have the subtitles for the Japanese version. The subs were literally just the same lines from the English dub version of the movie.

I knew this also because I had seen the movie on DVD and the DVD version has the subtitles translated from the Japanese version. Now I'm not saying that I hate the movie because it's one of my favorite Ghibli movies, but seriously Disney? You guys could at least have the subtitles for the Japanese version instead of just for the English version. Ironically though, the DVD that comes with the Blu-Ray combo pack still has the subtitles for the Japanese version intact including all of the references and the references to their testicles. So I can technically watch it with the original Japanese subtitles, but only on the DVD version because Disney was too lazy to put it on the Blu-Ray version as well.",1449187200,2,1184,4.584905660377358

It may seem benign at first, but the raccoons are heavily anthropomorphized and the references get more frequent as the movie goes on.  One latter scene heavily focused on the power that emanated from an old male raccoon's testicles and the recurring theme of the raccoons' inability to control their sexual urges is consummated in a scene with nudity.

I understand the want to make it acceptable for younger viewing in American Society, but it's still kind of silly. I'm a fan of Studio Ghibli so I decided to purchase this to add to my collection. As I said, it's not a bad movie...I just wouldn't watch it as often as I would others. It's got a decent story, and the art is beautiful as always.

2299497,5,B0009MAO3W,"A very sad story we've all heard. It was particularly resonate with me because I grew up in a town that used to be rural and is now suburban verging on urban.

In my version of the disk, they refer to the Tankuis only as 'raccoons.' Not 'racoon dogs' or 'tanukis'. I found this really annoying as even a really slow child knows the realistic tanuki drawings don't look like american raccoons. American raccoons are actually invasive to Japan. Also, they of course referred to the tankuki's magic friggin scrotums as 'special raccoon pouch' but bro, raccoons don't have pouches. This is one of those things that is just culturally lost in translation forever. I do not think there is any western equivalent.

Mostly really cute, with the moral being that indecisiveness and inaction solves nothing and that animals cannot speak for themselves.",1426377600,3,842,4.881118881118881

2299509,3,B0009MAO3W,"...to my American eyes. I watch a lot of anime, both kid-friendly stuff and adult-only stuff, and this one kind of baffles me.

There are a lot of radical tone shifts: the tanuki are realistic, then cartoony and dressed like samurai. They kill some people, then they play pranks on others. They party, then turn into humans, then use elemental powers--and their magic ""pouches""--to turn into fantastical creatures, and the movie ends with a really ""in your face"" environmental message.

I didn't really like it, or dislike it. I was a lot to process in just under 2 hours. Instead of a thumbs up or thumbs down, I'd give this one a shrug.

As for the infamous raccoon ""boy-parts"" scenes: personally, if I had kids, I'd probably let them watch it. They're (cartoon) animals, so I'd just play it off as ""part of nature"" if they realized what the ""pouches"" were. The many uses they put the pouches to is pretty silly, so some kids might take it in the same spirit as fart jokes and potty humor.

I just don't know if they'd like the movie. I don't know if I would have as a kid. It's like one of those videotapes we'd get from the library, that would disturb yet fascinate us, like the movie Samson and Sally. It had a strong environmental message, a lot of whaling scenes, and a part with goofy dancing walruses. I might have been grossed out, but still ended up watching it ten times with my brother and sister.

""Do you get it now?""  ""How about now.""  Got it in one and I'm onboard with the sentiment, just not too crazy about the sledgehammer approach belaboring the message.

2299547,2,B0009MAO3W,"My family & I love Studio Ghibli & own lots of their movies. Love their beautiful animation! So needless to say we were excited to sit down & watch this movie together. We were pretty happy about it until the Tanukis started using their scrotums as a weapon!! My husband was shocked & said "" Did you see that?"" I said "" no you must've been mistaken, it must be a pouch"" but sure enough he was right. It is said in another review that these massive scrotums are such a small part of the movie but there's nothing small about it  as these Tanukis constantly battle & train other male tanukis to fight with their giant doodads, especially when they battle the humans. Nothing like getting smothered to death by an animals giant hairy scrotum!! Thankfully my children were young enough not to think anything of it at the time. Any male animal in this movie is obviously a male because even when they aren't using their genitals to attack people with they are still very clearly seen, just smaller, not inflated. The female animals also are very curvy & have furry cleavage/ breasts so its obvious what the gender of every animal is. Interesting though as I've never seen any animal shaped like a human women, let alone needing a bra.
 Also it was a very long movie which again I was thankful for because we had to stop it to send children to bed. After the kids went to bed my husband & I thought it best to finish it too see if there was anything else inappropriate in the film, oh my word am I glad we did!! At one point the animals decide to scare the human with a ghost & demon attack but humans think its some sort of parade. While the animals are in the shape of ghosts & demons they creep up behind a group of boys who are OBVIOUSLY looking at a porn mag & when the boys get scared they drop the magazine sideways & slow enough that you see several pages of naked women & breasts in it. Needless to say we had to tell our children the next day that the movie was totally inappropriate & they weren't allowed to finish it. We had them choose a different movie, got a pizza & played a game that night to make up for any disappointment but they all said they didn't really care about it anyway.
This movie would've been fine without all the sexual stuff in it, just should've never been a part of it. Again it was beautiful animation & it's a reminder that the animals God made live here too & they shouldn't get shoved off somewhere just cause someone wants to build another building but because the way man is depicted in this film it can only end badly for the animals. I honestly wouldn't waste time or money with this one as far as a family movie goes, just not for children. Sorry Studio Ghibli, love you guys but not this one.",1389312000,2,2733,4.274131274131274

2299551,4,B0009MAO3W,"I'm starting to think I'll never see an anime movie that doesn't amaze me in some way. Studio Ghibli, especially, almost never follows what I consider to be the ""normal"" story patterns. ""Pom Poko"", being the only remaining Ghibli film I had not seen, was my final test to see whether I liked all Ghibli films, and I passed with flying colors.

I generally prefer Hayao Miyazaki films to those of Isao Takahata, but even though Miyazaki was only minimally involved with this film, it is among of my favorites from the studio. The movie tells the story of one big long struggle for survival; the tanukis (or ""raccoons,"" as they are called in the English dub, which isn't bad by the way) are very odd creatures who can transform themselves into all kinds of things, including humans, and they use this ability in their many attempts to keep their forest home from being demolished. Obviously, as in most Studio Ghibli films, there's a good bit of environmentalism woven into the story; but, again like the others, it's not presented in a heavy-handed, slap-across-the-face style. Both the humans and the animals are treated with fairness, and the ""solutions"", if you will, at the end of the film actually brought tears to my eyes.

But despite some similar themes, this movie is not much like ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" (both among my favorites as well.) Though it is a sometimes emotional movie, a lot of the time it deals with the issues of environmentalism in a rather fun and entertaining way, keeping the 2-hour story from becoming too painful to watch. It also has quite a few themes that can apply to a lot of situations, such as the need to adapt without losing who you are. That, more than anything else, is something I admire about Studio Ghibli films: no matter what agenda they may or may not be pushing forward, they always have words of wisdom for everyone.",1388102400,,1901,4.6716417910447765

2299579,5,B0009MAO3W,"Pom Poko is a highly entertaining animated movie. It is at times genuinely funny, clever and endearing. As far as comparing it to other Studio Ghibli works, Pom Poko is actually fairly long and somewhat surreal, there is a ten minute ""parade scene"" where the raccoon dogs in the film transform into all forms of bizarre creatures and shapes, it is gorgeous to watch. The english dub is imperfect in that it does change a small amount of dialogue, and the voice acting for a couple of characters was weak but when taken in consideration of the whole movie are small gripes. I'd actually disagree with some of the reviewers here and say that overall Pom Poko is a ""less child oriented"" Ghibli movie along the lines of Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa, no doubt kids would enjoy it, but I'm in my late forties and found I liked it in a different way than I liked Ponyo or My Neighbor Totoro. I even laughed out loud at some moments.

This is a great movie for tweens and older, but I'd rather skip the drama for those under 7 years old.  YMMV.

2299603,4,B0009MAO3W,"To start: experiencing Studio Ghibli films can be disconcerting but is always rewarding. Somehow they capture the essence of what I imagine it is to be Japanese and to live in Japan. It's refreshing to see a cultural output that draws on its own folklore that is so alien to what most of us, who have grown up on the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson, and Pixar, know and cherish. In Pom Poko, we have a good example of this.

Pom Poko is about a group of Tanuki, raccoon-dogs, who live in the forests on the edges of Tokyo in the 1960s. As Tokyo expands, the Tanuki are forced to take action at the loss of their habitat. The journey on how they first fight against their habitat to ultimately learn to live with their human neighbors is a poignant and sad one. A host of questions are raised and there are no easy answers. Still, the movie sparkles with wit and humor. Lots of humor, especially from the lines that the narrator speaks. And yes there are balls. So what? It's just another slice of Japan; one that I find interesting if bewildering.

Should you watch this? If you love Studio Ghibli, then yes. If you love a good story, then yes as well. The theme of the story is something not unique to Japan either. Learning to live in balance with our surroundings is something all modern societies struggle with. But if you're thinking about watching this film then you know the environmental themes are found in almost all of Studio Ghibli's fantastical films.",1351382400,,1472,4.530075187969925

I'm an Anime fan in general - I would say the Gibli films are usually targeted primarily for children and have a certain, slick polish to them. Pom Poko is a bit different - it shares the same themes as many of the Gibli films - our destruction of nature and how this destruction creates discord with the Shinto spirits of nature. It differs in that it is not as polished in some places and there seem to be certain stylistic inconsistencies with the animation - nothing too serious and I attribute much of this to the fact that this film is older than many of those that have become popular in the US market recently. The movie really is bizarre in many respects though - it feels more Japanese than many of the other films and is very quirky. I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout the film which is not the way I usually react to Gibli films - it was just so weird! Those who criticize the film because of the occasional, cartoonish depiction of testes should really try and think outside the box of our own cultural norms. Certainly Japanese culture is equal to the US in terms of modernity and sophistication - the depiction of testes is not meant to be pornographic or dirty in any way - its simply part of their culture. And really, the drawings of them aren't very realistic so its hard to see how it could offend anyone.

My kids, now 7 and 9, have cherished them all: Kiki's Delivery Service, Nausicaa, Castle In The Sky, Howl's Moving Castle (my favorite), The Cat Returns (huge hit at my daughter's slumber party), Ponyo... and they wanted more. I hadn't heard of Pom Poko and stumbled acrossed it here on Amazon. The reviews made me a little concerned regarding the males' scrotums, but after I watched the trailer for this movie with my 9 year old daughter on YouTube, we couldn't wait to order Pom Poko and get it home!  I had told her about the ""pouch"" thing and told her not to make an issue of it. When watching the movie she giggled a couple times, but they were funny scenes!  Her 7 year old brother didn't notice or seemed phased.  As far as the two little bumps ""down there"" when the male characters are standing-- not a deal; our male dog shows more-- it's just the male body. And when the characters inflated them or transformed them, it was only a few times and just a little quirky but no biggie.  That was a non-issue in a overall wonderful film.  And the movie is so beloved by both of my kids. They have seem it countless times already and belly laugh at their favorite parts every time. It is up there with Nausicaa for them. I loved it myself. A great message, and very entertaining.  People said the ending is not ""Disney"", but it's a pleasant ending.  The same director did Grave of the Fireflies-- one of the best and saddest movies ever.

In Japan's history, Tanuki hides were used to help flatten gold into very thin sheets. So, tanuki were good at stretching a dollar. This brought the idea that they must have very large 'kintama' (money pouch).'Kintama' was also slang for a man's 'family jewels'. So really, it's a pun gone wild in Japanese Folklore.

The humor of the tanuki's kintama is as crass as seeing a guy get wanged in the crotch in American media. It's mostly a cheap laugh, but this is intended as a Children's movie. Even so, it's necessary to the subject depicted and there is a reason why Disney released this one so quietly. They were required to not alter it in any way.

It's a good film, and an excellent piece of cultural education for any age.",1297728000,4,775,4.601449275362318

However, in order to really appreciate its content, one has to be familiar with the real and mythical Tanuki.  Tanuki is not a raccoon, nor a badger, but a real animal in Japan.  He is also a character with complex mythology and much symbolism which is strange and not at all obvious to Westerners.  A good reference to understand a bit about Tanuki is [...].
With this information, many of the puzzling and unsettling aspects of Pom Poko become comprehensible.  Unfortunately, watching this fine animation without some background loses many viewers.

2299622,3,B0009MAO3W,"Pom Poko is a film produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Isao Takahata that relies heavily on Japanese folklore.  Pom Poko was released by Disney as part of the deal the company made with Studio Ghibli; the film was released in the United States on DVD in 2005.  Pom Poko tells the story of a group of tanuki (called raccoons in the English dub and subtitles) who are trying to find a way to save their home the Tama New Town development that's being built and causing a decrease in living space and food for the tanuki.

The animation in Pom Poko employs at least two or three different styles, especially when it comes to the Tanuki.  Not that this is bad, but it can be a bit disorienting at times.  Personally, even though this film was given a PG rating, I don't think it's entirely appropriate for younger viewers.  There are shots of a couple of the Tanuki being run over by automobiles, which could be disturbing to young children.  Also, in at least one battle, the male Tanuki use their testicles as a weapon.  Personally, I would recommend Pom Poko for anime viewers who are thirteen or fourteen years of age and older.

Pom Poko was released as a two disc set.  There is only one special feature included on the first disc.  The feature is the trailers and TV spots for Pom Poko, and this runs for about eight minutes.  There are four promotional spots in all, which have the original Japanese audio with English subtitles.  The second disc only has the storyboard version of the film included on it.

Pom Poko has an interesting premise, but it is one of the longer films in the Studio Ghibli catalog.  The pacing of the film is also a little slower than the other Studio Ghibli films, which is another thing that younger children wouldn't appreciate about this film.  However, if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli or Isao Takahata, then you should add this DVD to your collection.",1258416000,2,1895,4.497076023391813

I agree with some other reviews that most of the cultural elements are well explained, but there are some deeper things that I noticed that are worth a little research (maybe a summer project for the kids? i dunno).

2299625,2,B0009MAO3W,"Normally, strange plot devices/characters in movies make for entertaining viewing.  Despite all the weirdness of Pom Poko, it still managed to be boring on the one hand, and just plain odd on the other.

First of all, I am a great lover of Studio Ghibli films.  I've seen almost all of them at this point, and I've loved almost all of them.  So, I am no stranger to anime (I've watched tons of different anime, not just Studio Ghibli's) or Studio Ghibli's work.  This one, however, really isn't that good.  I almost gave it 3 stars until I realized how biased that was; if anyone but Studio Ghibli had put this out, I'd have given it a much lower rating, so it gets it's two stars.  Anyway, Pom Poko covers the story of a group of raccoons (actually they are tanukis, but in English it was changed to raccoons) who are trying to stop the humans from destroying their forest.

So what's wrong with this movie?  My complaints begin with the pacing.  It's rather dull.  It spans several years, and the plot twists this way and that before getting to any real conclusion.  Not to mention the repetitiveness: the raccoons come up with a plan to stop the humans, they celebrate prematurely, they find out that it didn't work, they mourn.  Repeat this several times.  It really got old.  Another thing is the narration.  The movie is told in substantial bits with a narrative monologue.  This really dulled it down for me; it sort of broke up the action and distanced the viewer from the things actually going on.  Also, the fact that there really wasn't a specific central character made it more difficult to focus or care.

Another complaint I have is the weirdness of bludgeoning people to death with giant testicles.  I realize it's cultural, and it's not that I'm offended by it, it was just really weird.  This strange element really should've made the movie interesting with its sheer bizareness, but the movie was still rather dull.  That's truly paradoxical.

Another thing you should take note of is the environmentalist message.  It should be obvious from the synopsis that this is a movie with heavy environmentalist themes.  I truly sympathized with the raccoons, as it was very sad to see them struggle in vain to save their home.  In fact, the film makers went to great length to make us identify and sympathize with the raccoons by making them anthropomorphic and continually depicting their struggles.  Unfortunately, all the human-bashing ""humans are evil"" dialogue ended up making me feel more defensive than sympathetic at the end of the movie.  Still, almost all of Studio Ghibli's movies are environmentalist, but it's never bothered me until this movie.

I've heard that this movie was actually supposed to be a comedy of sorts.  I can see how some scenes are silly, but I think the humor may have been lost in translation, so to speak.  Perhaps I would've laughed alot more if I was Japanese.  I think maybe alot of the humor went over my head, and that's why I didn't enjoy it as much.

Ultimately, I find Pom Poko difficult to recommend to anyone really.  Perhaps those already familiar with Studio Ghibli's other works should watch this to say they've seen all Studio Ghibli has to offer.  If you're new to Studio Ghibli, I suggest seeing just about any other one of their works, especially Howl's Moving Castle, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.",1221609600,10,3387,4.712095400340716

The scene where they go into town and put on that sort of fireworks/illusion show for the humans was cool, but that's about it.

2299629,4,B0009MAO3W,"After seeing a film such as Ocean Waves (I Can Hear The Sea) I was really in the mood get back into the fantasy mode of Ghibli. Ocean Waves is a brilliant real story about 3 friends growing up together and experiencing life head on. It can be awkward and sometimes confusing, but in the end you learn to cope and move forward. *Ocean Waves is not up for release yet so that was my brief review)

Then, we have 'Pom Poko'. It is the story of racoons with the ability to transform into many things from inatimate objects even human beings. In the late 1960s the racoons' home land is being dug up to make more room for new housing projects in Japan and the racoons have a war on their hands. The objective is to scare the humans into stopping production of these new houses and take what is theres. Through all the hardships and crazy parties the racoons soon reach the conclusion that in a constantly changing world they have to figure out ways to evolve with all their surroundings in order to remain alive.

A fantasy directed by Isao Takahata, is something to be prepared for. Takahata has a gift of brining realism to life in his films and he does the same with this one eventhough it envolves such kooky characters as racoons. There are very funny moments but also moments that will make you cry or make you feel warm inside. The characters share amazing bonds and play off each other real well.

It is a typical Ghibli film that includes multiple flight scenes (pocket-parachutes, and transformation parade), an environmental message, and numerous fantasy elements.

Pom Poko has a documentary feeling attached.  It opens with commentary from some of it's raccoon characters.  It then continues with a narrator through various portions of the film.  The narrator gives time periods and points out societal trends related to the topic.

Takahata captured the environmental effects of forest loss well.  The raccoons view each other as competition for food as the forest shrinks.  With less food comes less mating, etc.  He also expresses some Darwinian theories in it as well (i. e. adaptation, evolution, etc.).

The music is fun.  The raccoons frequently sing and dance and play music.  There are two or three songs that could be easily learned and sung by young children.  The rest of the music is fun, catchy, and diverse as well.  The soundtrack ought to be awesome.

2299632,5,B0009MAO3W,"""Pom Poko"", aka ""The Raccoon War"", is the story of various clans of raccoons in a region of Japan who, pressed for space and food as their world continues to disappear under the wheels of human 'progress', take to fighting each other for survival and later teaming up to resist the human encroachment.  These raccoons morph back and forth from realistic-looking quadrupeds to stubby, Ewok-like bipeds with clothes and primitive weapons as the story demands, and it never seems the least contrived.  More advanced shapeshifting is a more difficult skill to acquire, one known to foxes and a select few raccoons.

  The raccoons are often cute and playful, their efforts to disrupt human demolition and construction often falls into what can best be descibed as 'hi-jinks'.  And though the movie is, thus, tender and funny a lot of the times, most of the time that's a veneer masking a much grimmer story, one that sometimes takes center stage.  ""Pom Poko"" is anime, and one of the things that means is that no amount of lovability or animated cuteness on the part of the film's protagonists guarantees a happy ending.  The raccoons aren't just 'miffed' in a cartoonish way - they, and the other woodland creatures are starving and in danger of dying out.  There are both whimsical and darker fantastic elements in their campaign of resistance against the humans: their 'poltergeist' hauntings on the construction sites, the 'parade of phantasms' in a major Japanese city, etc.  But the story of envirornmental devastation being told is very real, and there are real consequences in the movie: both raccoons and humans sometimes meet with unfortunate fates.  Eventually a breed of foxes who have given up their 'fox status' and shapeshifted to survive by permanently living as humans enters the fray, along with some very old, very powerful, magical raccoons. The array of choices available to the protagonist 'main' racoons increases, but each one has its drawbacks. The animation is, as usual for Studio Ghibli, a triumph of imagination.

  In an interesting twist, at one point one of the main raccoons actually addresses the viewers of ""Pom Poko"" directly, apparantly seeking in particular to grab the attention of young tots.  It may be a wise move on the raccoon's part to seek the attention of the generations that will one day have power; the generations that have power now and have had for the last decades have, despite some encouraging signs of late, not really amassed the best track records.

  ""Pom Poko"" is many things - hilarious, lovable, fierce, globally relevant, tragic, triumphant and more.  Parts may be too intense for very young viewers (the also-excellent ""Once Upon A Forest"" raises some of the same issues but does it in a way less likely to really frighten, say, a three year-old.  And like ""Pom Poko"", ""Once Upon A Forest"" is great for older ages too) who will likely be attracted by the comedic charm of the box art - you should watch it with your young children when they see it the first time.  Other than that - which really isn't a minus; it can't make its point if there's always a safety net - this is an outstanding movie for everybody.  A Studio Ghibli marker might just be the greatest assurance of excellence you can look for on a movie.",1174953600,4,3276,4.833333333333333
2299633,4,B0009MAO3W,"Pom Poko, the ninth feature-length animated movie produced by Japan's Studio Ghibli, is a brilliantly-made film with a powerful message of how man's progress can sometimes impact nature in harmful ways.

The raccoons (""tanuki"" in Japanese) of the Tama Hills are suffering from the encroachment of human civilization (in the form of new suburbs of Tokyo) into their habitats, so they decide to fight back.  Fortunately, the tanuki are one of the animal species in Japanese legend with the power to change shape.  They can replicate inanimate objects, other animals and even people.  The raccoons must learn to effectively use their abilities to dissuade the humans from destroying their homes.

Isao Takahata - a colleague and mentor of the masterful Hayao Miyazaki - created a moving film that runs the full gamut of emotions; there are a lot of funny moments, but other scenes will definitely tug hard at your heartstrings.  Though the tanuki have these fantastic powers, their plight and anguish feel quite real... and the ending of the movie certainly reflects reality as well.  By the way, Tama New Town is a real place - built in the hills southwest of central Tokyo in the 1960's.

The English dub is quite close to the original Japanese script (with a few cultural allowances), and the English voice actors did an excellent job.

I would probably not recommend this film for really young children as there is quite a bit of death and violence associated with the raccoon struggle, and a tiny bit of implied birds-and-bees stuff.

2299634,4,B0009MAO3W,"In Japanese folk tales Tanuki or racoon dogs are believed to trick people in a mischivous manner. Takahata-san with the support of Miyazaki(Konchou Daimyoujin a tanuki god from Awa, Shikoku borrows the self-image of him I guess) puts out ecology-motivated film somewhat parodical of Naussica and Castle In The Sky with similar poignant message. Since MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO Takahata/Miyazaki team tries to bring back Japanese nomadic landscape seriously in danger of destruction by current urban development. Unlike Naussica and Castle In The Sky this work puts more emphasize to the point. Racoon dogs are now being deprived of the home by housing development and they work together to revenge human and try to stop the development. Takahata gives the poor racoons the every idea and folk legends to fight against humans. Japanese scenary was vividly recreated by the hands of kazuo Oga known by the brilliant works in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Princess Mononoke"". Overall, it is well-crafted ecology-motivated movie and very fun as well. The ending scene is reused for Whisper of the Heart as the film depicts the Tama Hill area before residential complex was developed.

Verdict: Fun movie yet with clear message

2299635,3,B0009MAO3W,"Pom Poko is the story of a group of tanuki (""raccoon-dogs"" that feature in Japanese culture, and have a mythic ability to shapeshift) who fight back against the encroachments of developing Tokyo. The moral of the story is: work with nature, not against it. You know. Like every other movie out of this studio.

If this were a western cartoon, most of the reviews of this movie would tell you the following:

That this movie is cute, but very slowly paced.

That it is repetitive. (The tanuki rebel. Celebrate. Learn that the humans haven't given up yet. Mourn. Decide to rebel again. Repeat ad nauseum.)

That many of the characters kind of blend together.

That the movie is too preachy; not subtle enough.

That using a gigantic scrotum as a bludgeon is just plain weird.

However, people don't say these things because this isn't a western cartoon. It is anime, and anime gets a special pass. When there's something that is confusing in anime, we assume that it accounts to translation issues, or cultural backgrounds, and can't possibly be the fault of the writers. I will grant that tanukis are known for their large genitalia in Japanese culture; however, using one's scrotal sack as a parachute is odd no matter where you're born.

I don't mean to say that this is an awful film. It's cute (great animation), if too slow. But don't be fooled by those who insist that everything that comes out of Japan is genius (let alone Studio Ghibli, which is sacrosanct). Some anime is good, some is bad, some is in-between.

  Pom Poko is about magical creatures that can transform into humans (or statues).  The creatures' Tama Hills are being destroyed by Man, and the creatures go to war.  3 Humans die in the movie, but the creatures do pray for them...killing humans weren't a part of thier plan.

  I was surprised that Disney released a film that had inflatable testicles in it.  It shocked me the first time I saw it, but I soon forgot it.  In the English dub, they are called ""pouces"".

2299641,5,B0009MAO3W,"Ah, now this is a wonderful little film. While I admit that I was skeptical at first, it quickly reveals itself to be a sweet, sad, and humorous story, well worth the two hours it takes to watch it.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there are any number of scenes in this movie that many would consider inappropriate for younger children - but one must bear in mind that what is appropriate for children varies widely from country to country.

The movie focuses on a clan of Tanuki, mistakenly called 'raccoons' in the dubbed version. In actuality, tanuki, or 'raccoon DOGS,' are a species of small-bodied wild dogs, rather like foxes, but closely resembling the raccoons of North America. These are canines, not raccoons, but as few children or even adults are aware of this, the change can be forgiven.

In Japanese folklore, cats, foxes, and tanuki are powerful shapeshifting tricksters, and Pom Poko relies heavily on these old tales. The tanuki change shape with their moods - from the realistic creatures they show themselves as when humans are around, to the cartoonish anthropomorphic caricatures they interact with one another as. In battle, their forms shift from warrior to peasant as the tide turns towards and against their favor.

The story is a familiar one - creatures driven from their homes rally together to oppose the humans - but the goings on are rather unlike anything one would see in an animated movie produced in America. Characters are killed by cars, transform themselves into demons, and use their pronounced scrotums as weapons. And yet it all flows together perfectly, and even the testicles are hardly a bother once one has become engrossed in the story.

I imagine quite a few young children may find parts of this movie upsetting, and the conclusion is hardly the fairy-tale ending seen in so many Disney movies, but any emotionally mature child should have no problem with any of the content. If the presence of the testicles seriously bothers you, the English dub conveniently calls them 'pouches.' (No, tanuki most definitely do NOT have pouches... neither do raccoons, but I doubt you'll care if you're already so afraid of anatomy, now will you?) It's not as if your child is going to use his own testicles as a weapon (and if he does, I'd love to hear about it), and any child who has owned a male animal, or is in fact male himself, is bound NOT to be traumatized by the sight.

Have a little faith in your child, and in the makers of this film, and give it a chance. If you keep an open mind about the other cultures of this world, I'm sure you'll be surprised by this oddly endearing movie.",1136246400,42,2635,4.704989154013015
2299642,5,B0009MAO3W,"I just had the opportunity to finally see ""Pom Poko,"" thanks to Disney's stateside DVD release. Fortunately, the dub is fantastic -- any qualms about ""confusing"" Japanese folktales and such seem to have been taken care of with the quality translation. The voice actors (only one ""name"" actor, a very fine/unrecognizable Jonathan Taylor Thomas) acquit themselves quite nicely, and it might be one of the best dubs I've ever heard.

The infamous enlarged scrotums, I'm happy to report, are such a small part of the entire experience that the fact that it was so dwelled on by dozens upon dozens of people for years prior to domestic DVD release is saddening. At first, yes, when a ""pouch"" is magically (and humorously) transformed into a red rug, it's amusing and a bit shocking. But that feeling wears off almost instantly.

Even though they changed the references of ""scrotum"" to ""pouch,"" I'm still surprised Disney had the balls (pun intended) to release it, given their standards for ""family""-esque (safe and arguably predictable) entertainment. There are a couple glimpses of actual nudity (breasts) and some humans die in rather morbid ways. I'm not inferring that I wish they hadn't released it, for if they had not I would have never seen it. I'm just happy with their decision. For once, at least in recent times, I feel the need to thank Disney whole heartedly.

The film itself is such a pleasure. It moves briskly, contains *beautiful* images and is endlessly entertaining. A large part of it's success is due to the constant narration; as others have noted, it almost seems like an exquisite documentary at times.

The story is simple yet effective: humans are destroying a community of tanukis, and the tanukis do everything they can to help preserve their home in way of transformation. It's often funny and adorable, but what's somewhat unexpected is the amount you'll be moved by their struggle. The ending, criticized by some, almost moved me to tears. I won't explain what happens, but some wise things are said.

As you probably know, the tanukis are somewhat distractingly called ""raccoons"" in the dub. I'm willing to forgive Disney for this obvious error, though, as they resemble the latter to a pretty high degree. And I'm sure it made it easier on the translators for lip synchronization (two syllables).

Not so surprising: ""Pom Poko"" was the top box office smash in Japan the year it came out (and Japan's own submission for best foreign film Oscar). Regardless of the minor violence/nudity/inflated scrotums (ahem), this film will appeal to anyone with a heart and a brain. It's not some minor little piece about tanukis humorously fending off humans, even if it sometimes appears to be. It's a major statement about man vs. nature, and it's often beautiful and witty and intelligent, the sort of thing most non-animated films aspire to be.

I know this might sound rash and pretentious, but I watched two films tonight: ""Laputa"" (Japanese with subtitles) and ""Pom Poko"" (English dub). Oddly, I liked this film more. Here's hoping that master director Takahata's underrated treasure will win over more viewers, thanks to Disney's recent bare-bones DVD release and the eventual airing on Turner Classic Movies this January.",1135900800,104,3248,5.003703703703704

It's definitely a departure from the heart-wrenching 'Fireflies'

This is a light-hearted movie about a bunch of raccoons whose habitats are being threatened by men.

While I thought the movie had its cute moments, the movie takes far too long getting to its conclusion.

One other thing, I have never seen so many scenes of raccoons utilising their testicles....you'll see testicles being used to crush someone to death, testicles being used as a parachute, testicles being used as a rug, and my favourite - testicles being used to crash a truck.

2299644,4,B0009MAO3W,"I just watched this wonderful anime for the first time yesterday. I am a fan of all Studio Ghibli films, plus I have a great interest in Japanese folklore, especially Tanukis and Kitsunes.

I gave the film only 4 out of 5 b/c of the English translation...

Tanukis are NOT raccoons- nor do they have any relation what-so-ever to raccoons! Tanukis are a real animal in Japan, known in America as ""Racoon-Dogs"" i.e. DOGS that resemble raccoons or badgers. They are in the wild CANINE family, though like Foxes, cannot interbreed with other canines.

They should have just kept the word 'Tanuki' in the film. Or used Raccoon-DOG if they didn't want to keep the Japanese species name.

So constantly hearing the Tanuki referred to as 'Raccooons' took away alot of the spirit & folklore of this film.

Also, you should know that this is probably not a film you want your young children to watch unless you do not mind them seeing cartoon animal testicles.

Like the legends of the magical Tanukis, the male tanuki have large testicles that they can enlarge (alot) and use as weapons, parachutes, blankets, etc.

Though the English translation tries to cleverly cover up what they are by calling them ""Raccoon Pouches"" *rolls eyes*

Aside from the American translations ruining Japanese folklore, this is a great film about survival told from the viewpoint of the Tanukis. Their land, and their numbers, are drastically disappearing due to humans paving over the forests to build houses, roads, etc.

The story is told very well, and makes it seem possible that some animals can have magical, shape-shifting powers while cleverly hiding from man.",1131580800,13,1640,4.913043478260869

If the prominent scrotums (mentioned in another review) weren't bad enough, the raccoons transformed into Ninja/Sumo/Samurai warriors and committed mayhem and violence against each other. This movie would probably appeal to pre-teen boys, but is not appropriate for yongre kids. Why is Disney squandering their good name on junk like this???",1128297600,13,524,5.011494252873563
2299646,5,B0009MAO3W,"Pom poko is a classics tale of clash between man and nature. Rapid development in the modern world reaches tama hill and the racoons are forced to leave their natural habitat as finding food and shelter becomes harder with each passing day. With nothing seems to be working out for them, racoons decide to unite and scare away the advancement of the modern world by learning traditional art of transforming. Will they be successful in their mission or will they be wiped out by the modern world progress? Will man and nature ever learn to live in harmony? That's what forms the rest of the film in an unusual, emotional and often hilarious ways.

Pom poko is directed by another studio ghibli genious Isao takahata who happens to be hayao miyazaki's long time friend and his senior. Pom poko remains studio ghibli's most strange film till date which is in no way lesser rich and intense than any other ghibli films but few contents in the movie may put some viewers off. The movie has been given a pg rating. It does contain lots of frightening images, ghosts, scrotums and a few references of mating here and there.

Lets now move on to this 2disc dvd release by disney and buena vista. Although it is a 2disc edition but it still is a barebone release. This time there's not even a ""behind the microphone"" featurette which featured on all previous ghibli releases by disney. It is said that pom poko was the hardest dub for disney as it had lots of songs, hundreds of racoons talking and situations where dialogues were needed not just for the racoons talking and singing but the objects like tv and other stuff in the background as well. Though the english dub is nowhere near the original japanese track, yet a behind the scenes on english dubbing would have made some sense, at least this time.

Pom poko dvd shines when it comes to picture and sound quality. The digital transfer is crisp and flawless. English and japanese, both audio tracks on the disc have been rendered in dolby digital 2.0 surround sound. Only extra feature on disc one happens to be original trailers and tv spots of the movie. Disc two, as usual, contains the full movie in storyboard form which would have made more sense had it been given alongwith the film on the first disc.

Pom poko contains japanese cultural and traditional references and themes more than any other studio ghibli film. It would have been really interesting to see a feature explaining all those in detail. The least expected was the feature on ""tanuki"" (racoons, as they call it in japanese) which appears on the region2 dvd of pom poko released by buena vista japan.

Pom poko is a comparatively lesser known (to the west) film from studio ghibli which is on par with any of their own fims when it comes to richness and execution of the subject and does not disappoint in anyway. The animation is detailed and flawless and backgrounds lush and breathtaking. People at disney had a hard time just dubbing the voices for the racoons, wonder what the animators at ghibli would have gone through animating them!

Although this dvd is light on extras, yet the set is definitely worthwhile just for the movie itself. Highly recommended to all studio ghibli fans out there (who definitely do not need my recommendation, i'm sure!!!) and to everyone else looking for good cinema with great storytelling.",1128211200,22,3351,4.690476190476191

2299649,4,B0009MAO3W,"Fans who remember Isao Takahata best for his relentless tearjerker, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, could very well react with surprise and shock upon viewing POM POKO.  This lavishly animated tale about raccoons battling for their homeland (which was the biggest hit of 1994 in Japan) isn't so much a heartwrenching tragedy as it is an interesting amalgam of humor, drama, and action--all delivered in a way that is daringly original for animation.  At times, the viewer gets treated to scenes which recall the one-two-three emotional punch of GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, but even though the tone of the movie is somber, a handful of lighthearted moments elevate the overall production out of depression.

As this is a Studio Ghibli film, production values are spectacular.  Backgrounds are painted with a tasteful mixture of simplicity and art, and the raccoons are as cuddlesome as you would expect--especially when they shape-shift from ""ordinary"" animals to Saturday-morning-cartoon style critters in the style of shows such as CARE BEARS.  (If you're scratching your head while reading this, don't be alarmed--according to Japanese folklore, raccoons have the power to transform into anything--including human beings!)  The actual animation is as colorful and imaginative as you might expect from a Ghibli movie--and there is one scene where we are treated to cameo appearances by Porco Rosso, Kiki, and Totoro.

While POM POKO has a story to tell and a meaningful message for one to think about, its character and plot aspects may come across as a bit off-putting to viewers expecting a typical animated feature.  Indeed, while some raccoons identify themselves with distinguishable names and/or personalities (for example, Gonta is a burly, rough-and-ready raccoon who is always looking for a fight, while Oroku is the ""wise woman"" of the tribe), the story offers little in the way of character development.  In fact, most of the action in the story is narrated (by Maurice LaMarche in English, Kokondei Shinchou in Japanese), which elevates the overall effect of the movie to that of a semi-documentary.  For the most part, this approach works to a very interesting degree and is a refreshing change of pace.  However, there were some scenes in the movie where I wished the narration could have been reduced a little bit, as it sometimes gets in the way of appreciating the beauty of the visuals onscreen.

Aside from this, the biggest controversy about POM POKO seems to be centered on several scenes where the raccoons can inflate and/or transform their testicles(!) for multiple purposes.  One particular scene involves a raccoon flattening his testicles against a truck, causing its driver to crash.  Such moments may be alarming to children, but it is important to remember that while we see the testicles at times, the movie is, after all, animated.  Even still, while a Japanese audience may take such scenes naturally, squeamish viewers in America could react differently.  In fact, as a solution to handling this kind of translation issue, the English language version (produced once again by Disney) refers to the testicles as ""pouches"".  That's a somewhat awkward decision, but it sure beats digitally removing the testicles from the scenes they're in.

POM POKO was obviously a nightmare for English dub writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt to translate (especially since much of the movie is rooted in Japanese culture), but I really have to commend them for their efforts.  There is some Americanizing here and there, but there was little, if any, that I could find missing in their script.  In fact, I was most impressed at how they handled the songs; while at least two of them come across as a little contrived and/or corny, others flow so naturally that you never would have sworn that these were originally Japanese folksongs.

Another interesting aspect of the dub is the voice acting.  With the exception of Jonathan Taylor Thomas (star of TV's HOME IMPROVEMENT), the cast consists of veteran performers who are known for cartoon voice work; Tress MacNeille, John DiMaggio, Russi Taylor, Andre Stojka, and Clancy Brown, to name a few.  Whether this was done to cut down on costs for big-name stars or for avoiding aural distraction is unclear, but when listening to the spirit and energy that the aforementioned voice artists give their characters, it really doesn't matter.  For purists, though, the original Japanese language track IS included on the DVD, as is a gorgeous visual transfer (and a disappointingly skimpy supply of extras--the only low point of this otherwise top-notch presentation from Disney).

POM POKO may be an unusual entry from Isao Takahata, and its foreign aspects may not appeal to everyone, but if given a chance, the film offers a colorful display of imagination and pathos as well as an experience unlike many that one will find from ordinary cartoons.",1125273600,63,4895,5.111668757841907
