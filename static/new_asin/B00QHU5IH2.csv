6870686,1,B00QHU5IH2,Not a movie about entrepreneurship.... it is a movie about Network marketing and MLM's as a business and how well MLM's are doing and how much money they are making for beginning home based business owners.

6870690,2,B00QHU5IH2,"I was given this video to watch.  This is a sales pitch for ""network marketing"" -- apparently a rebranded term for multi-level marketing (MLM) and direct sales, to try to divorce it from the bad reputation those terms have garnered.  I feel safe saying that about this video, since the main narrator says fairly early in the video that the terms are synonymous.

At least the documentary is honest.  The narrator shares some interesting statistics.  He says that distributors of network marketing companies earn some $71 billion per year, or $200 million per month, worldwide.  Later in the show, he says that there are 96 million people working in network marketing, worldwide.  I may be rusty in my math skills, here, but that says to me that on average, network marketers are making about $2/month ($200 million/96 million).  Given how averages work, that suggests to me that many of those 96 million people are probably making less than that $2/month.

This is hardly a ringing endorsement of the success of network marketing in helping people earn a living wage.  There may be places in the world where $2/month gets you somewhere, but where I live is not one of them.",1455580800,2,1173,4.82

6870752,5,B00QHU5IH2,"This is an EXCELLENT documentary regarding what is truly going on in the United States of America and the rest of the world, regarding how things have changed (forever) when it comes to the outdated model of going to school, getting a job and hoping to work with one company for the rest of your life.

When you watch this documentary you will discover the refreshing truths, as I did, regarding what is really going on in the working world today - and it is a far departure from the misinformation that is being told to you from main stream media. You will learn which is better in the new global economy; is it safer to work for someone else, or is it better to become an entrepreneur. If a person were to decide to become their own boss, and not work for someone else, how could the average person, with limited education or business experience, accomplish this noteworthy endeavor with only taking minimal calculated risks.

What I really liked about this documentary is that not only do you get to hear from the filmmaker, Eric Worre, but you also get to hear from numerous experts and thought leaders from around the world in the field of business and entrepreneurship.

The documentary also awakens you to new possibilities regarding which direction people could take in order to change their lives for the better, based on simple to understand, non-bias, and proven and documented facts.",1418083200,6,1395,4.709016393442623

I don't like working with numbers but this helped put it all into perspective and helped solidify my why; the reason I am working to build my business. For this who have had doubt, like some husbands, this helped reaffirm their understanding of network marketing to see that it's not just a waste of time when you see it through. I highly recommend this to watch if you are considering network marketing, having doubts in your business, or need some statistics when someone questions or belittles you for your business. It's important to know what to look for when you get started and what to expect. It's not get rich quick, it's hard work with a promising payout that puts people first and money second. Most big box companies have that value mixed up. Empower yourself and watch this! It will be an hour well spent!",1498348800,2,944,4.625
