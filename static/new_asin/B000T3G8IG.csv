8207694,5,B000T3G8IG,"As a [very] small child, my grandmother had the first and third of these VHS tapes, and I simply adored them! When I suddenly remembered them one day, I jumped straight to Amazon and sure enough, they were in stock here.

After watching them again as an adult, I remember how oddly sadistic some of these tales were, but that makes them all the more intriguing. A very strong feeling of nostalgia overtook me when the opening scene started (when Beatrix is hurrying to get home; the scenes where she is writing and drinking tea before a new segment begins). I hope many more generations of children will enjoy these as I did, they're wonderfully entertaining and bring back fond memories of my childhood.",1314835200,,704,4.67741935483871
