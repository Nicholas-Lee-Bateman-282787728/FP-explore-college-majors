A LARGE COLLECTION OF TRAIN VIDEOS.  HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY
AND SOUND...SO I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS PRODUCT SHOULD
BE RECOMMENDED.",1215993600,,231,4.634146341463414
8280810,4,B000FGG65W,"This is a great little show that concentrates on a single mammoth steam locomotive and the people who keep it running.  Any train nut will love the lush and loving photography, but even people who don't know much about railroading will find the greasy, hard-bitten crew an interesting group to spend some time with.  There's also some suprisingly good original music that's part of the program!  (OK... I produced and wrote the program, but you really will like it!)",1149811200,4,466,4.8734177215189876
