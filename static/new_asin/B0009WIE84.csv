8068373,1,B0009WIE84,Looks to be a foreign film. Not what I had in mind to get! I went with 2001 and 2008 versions.,1422230400,,94,3.5238095238095237

8068375,4,B0009WIE84,"in its sensibilities . . . not a ""happy story"" in much of any way, more a commentary on human frailty.  Short summary . . . woman gives up everything for short, meaningless fling, nothing follows.  Love is worse than blind . . . it's stupid.",1387065600,2,241,4.217391304347826
8068376,4,B0009WIE84,"The movie your are reviewing is not the one this refers to. This one is about a woman who falls for the much younger roommate of an author whose book she is editing. She is obsessively in love with the young man and ruins her career and most likely her marriage and life, but that is for the movie to tell you.

If you are in a marriage or have been in an affair and worked it through or having trouble with your marriage... do not watch this. It can bring up a lot of troubling aspects of married life. I heartily recommend it to those who want to see what a train wreck looks like up close.

So, this is not set in Rio and is not stupid. Review the right movies.",1214438400,7,664,3.9849624060150375
