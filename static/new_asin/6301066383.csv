7809212,5,6301066383,"I have been a huge fan of Richard Marx's for years and I'm only 19!  He has an amazingly unique voice, and he sounds really great in this live concert from 1988 in which he performs several songs from his first album and a couple songs from his second album. I highly recommend this concert as it is one you can enjoy over and over and over again if you love Richard Marx. I know I have enjoyed it several times already. :-)",1238716800,,424,4.108433734939759
7809213,5,6301066383,"I like a good movie on a wednesday night, I'm not going to feed you any other story. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! Seriously, do you think I'm lying? I've had about enough your attitude and the way you doubt what I say. You need to go back to that hole you climbed out of. I was sitting there looking for a great movie and there was a movie called ""hold onto the knight"" starring some dude name Dick Marx. From the picture, I thought it would be the story of a singer trying to keep some medieval knight from getting out of sherwood forest. Wow, was I wrong. Instead it's the story of this white guy with really tall hair standing on stage and singing songs about chicks. I was blown away even though his acting wasn't real good. I would've had Hasselhoff play him, but you can't always get what you want. I was very emotionally disturbed after seeing this, much like I felt after seeing Problem Child. Marx is truly a loser in comparison to me, but compared to you, he's John F. Kennedy. See, it's one thing for me to watch this and like it, for you it would be yet another depressing reminder of how long it's been since you've had a date. So you shouldn't get this even if I like it because watching the same movies as me won't make you anything close to me.",1128038400,2,1271,4.191836734693878
7809214,5,6301066383,"As always, Richard Marx is wonderful in concert and this video is no exception.  One of the most talented musicians today.  A must have for any serious fan.  Also great early footage of saxiphonist, Dave Koz.  My  favorite from this video is ""That was Lulu""; this is rare footage  of him performing this song which was only performing during his first  years.  ""Real World"" is another rare performance that shines.  ""Hold On To The Nights"" is the actual video recorded for this  song.  His abilty to ""sound like the record"" and better is  amazing.  Always a pleasure to see live!  I have never attended a bad  concert by him and this video is no different.",945734400,8,656,4.582608695652174
