8478233,5,B005LKH6WO,We watched the original Coast series and I thought I had to have this one too. It is a GREAT DVD and well worth the money. The scenery is breathtaking and the narrative is great and all the stories are interesting. Not your run-of-the-mill DVD....top quality. You will be very happy with this DVD. BUY IT!!!,1369785600,,307,4.5
