8001548,5,B0000E1II2,"Shades of butter is a unique presentation of photography, art ,trendy fashion and hip-music. The video is ascetically pleasing to the eyes and ears. When a friend recommended, I asked, ""What's the big deal with this Buttervision and Shades of butter all about."" She said, ""when you'll see it you'll ""get it"".
 I now understand what all the buzz is about. Although I'm a New Yorker, I enjoy this L.A. lifestyle video and the directors unique approach. I'm sure this new director Dexter Browne will be a big name in the industry. (or least he'll be known throughout the country as he is in L.A.) Are there other volumes out there ?
