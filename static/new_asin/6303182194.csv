7840111,5,6303182194,The first time I ever found an exercise I love to do and would stick with it was in 1995 with this vhs my friend let me borrow. I found I could always fit this into my schedule and enjoyed it every time. It was difficult at first but after a month my weight decreased and my energy soared. I had all the information to order this but the company had moved with no forwarding. I searched and searched even signed up on her blog and sent her an email about this. She did not reply. I had ordered several other exercises of hers but it was not the same. I am so glad I took the chance and didn't give up. The picture on the front is not the one in the video so I am pleased to say I am more then happy with this video and she should really put it on a DVD and sale it.,1353196800,,765,3.7875
7840112,5,6303182194,This is one of the best step workouts. Victoria's cueing is awesome. A beginner can easily follow this video. And Victoria advises the more advanced to take steps to tempo while she is instructing the beginner. It is 30 minutes long but you will really work up a sweat and feel like you have worked out. Great for those days when you are short on time. Light sculpting with weights is also included.,1090454400,,399,4.47945205479452
7840113,5,6303182194,This video shows you how to step and attention is paid to proper form. I bought the video years ago and have just started to use it faithfully. I am feeling like I am getting in shape.,1048550400,,184,4.0
7840114,5,6303182194,"I love Victoria's workouts, and this is one of my favorites.  This is a nice step workout and great to do when you don't have much time.  This is one of the few workout tapes that I have used again and again (many others  are collecting dust).",944352000,7,243,4.127659574468085
