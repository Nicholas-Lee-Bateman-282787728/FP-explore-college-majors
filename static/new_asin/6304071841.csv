7860869,5,6304071841,"Who would have thought that a ""no name"" cast and director could produce the best film version of Shakespeare's classic love story?  With no Franco Zeffirelli, Baz Luhrman (or George Cukor) at the helm, and no Olivia Hussey, Leonard Whiting, Claire Danes, Leonardo diCaprio (or Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard) in the cast, this version is straightforward, swift and devastating in its impact.  Directed by Alan Horrox, and featuring Geraldine Somerville and Jonathan Firth as the star-cross'd lovers, this film is revelatory in its simplicity, pays attention to the words as the principal vehicle of the tragedy, and relies on acting rather than starpower.  Just terrific!",990144000,25,672,5.320754716981132
7860870,4,6304071841,"Actually, this is not the popular recent ""post-modern"" version of the classic tale. This is the version aired on television in 1994. It features Geraldine Somerville as Juliet and Jonathan Firth as Romeo. It was directed by Alan Horrox.  END",878860800,13,241,5.025
7860871,5,6304071841,"I thought the way they used symbolism in this movie  was incredible!  The most obvious was the water, which some people hated, but I thought it was very emotionally pulling.  Leonardo DiCaprio is, dare I say it, one of the best, if not THE best actor of my generation. He stays true to his reputation in the modernization of this classic.  We have to remember that when Shakespeare  used this language, the phrases were not cliches, as they  are now.  Leonardo and Claire Danes display the freshness  and vitality that the words originally had. I do have to say,  however, that the music is so loud at some points, you can hardly hear the words.  All around it's an excellent  piece. END",874195200,,687,4.549180327868853
