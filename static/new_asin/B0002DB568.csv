2079465,5,B0002DB568,This collection is very cute with Little People substituted for nursery rhyme characters. Our granddaughter started eating her corn and other vegetables after watching Eddy and his story.,1151193600,,187,5.714285714285714
2079466,1,B0002DB568,"We had all the Little People VHS and DVDs except this one, so I was excited to finally be bringing it home.  My daughter (now 26 months) has been hooked on Little People episodes since she was 6 months old!  But this particular DVD was dissapointing.  Because half of the episodes are simply summaries of past LP shows.  It doesn't hold my daughter's attention because she's seen it before.  It was a waste - I was looking for something fresh and new to show her and all we found was a replay of her other already owned episodes. :(",1124668800,25,532,4.333333333333333
2079487,5,B0002DB568,"Fast service, very happ. This was an item for my grandson and he was very happy. Would recomnmend to all my friends",1363564800,,115,4.2727272727272725
2079488,5,B0002DB568,My grandson loves the little people the DVD came quickly to the house thank you so much my grandson will sit and watch the little people with out saying a word,1363305600,,159,4.161290322580645
2079489,5,B0002DB568,Bought for my grandkids to watch when visiting. They really enjoy them and it has valuable messages for children regarding friendship and sharing.,1362268800,,146,5.391304347826087
2079490,5,B0002DB568,"I bought several of these for my daughter when she was younger, and they are wonderful.  Very entertaining.  Even as an adult, I still enjoyed them.",1356566400,,148,4.653846153846154
2079491,5,B0002DB568,"When I received this product, it was scratched badly. I called the seller and he credited my account. I still believe this is a great product and will buy more little people DVDs in the future.
The DVD is broken into 2 segments of about 30 minutes each. Each segment has 5 stories that are between 5-6 minutes.",1233532800,,310,4.362068965517241
2079492,4,B0002DB568,My son absolutely adores Little People and watches them constantly. The dvds promote good values and friendship which with todays other shows is refreshing. The Dvd is a total of 10 stories which are broken into two 5 min menus so if want you don't have to play all of them. If you want a product your child will love get this and other Little People movies. It is just unfourtunate that they do not sell in stores. At least none I have been to.,1211846400,,445,4.247058823529412
2079493,2,B0002DB568,"I bought this DVD after getting ""Discovering Animals"" free with a Little People toy.  The free DVD has 5 episodes which my 19 month old daughter loves.  I got this one to give her (and me!) a little variety.  It is split into two sections, the first 5 are re-tellings of fairy tales which are okay, but the second 5 are not-very-good summaries of past episodes.  It is a lot like those recap episodes that sitcoms do - all the characters get together and ""remember"" stuff.

Here are the episode summaries from the back of the box:

DISCOVERING STORYTIME
Eddie & the Cornstalk - Sarah Lynn tells the story of how an impatient Eddie discovers that too much of a good thing is not always good, when he overdoes it with Farmer Jed's special plant food.

The Frogly Duckling - Sonya Lee tells the story of a little frog who tries to be a duck, but discovers how much easier it is to fit in when you're just being yourself.

Hansel-Eddie and Sarah-Gretel - Michael tells the story of a brother and sister who discover a kindly baker building a yummy gingerbread house in the woods.  They offer to help - and help themselves to way too many treats.

The Monkey Who Cried Elephant - Eddie tells the story of a monkey who played an elephant-sized joke on his friends one too many times.  In the end, the joke - and the elephant - is on him.  Monkey discovers that if you want people to believe you, never tell lies.

Sonya Had a Little Lamb - Actually, Sonya Lee had a little dog named Lucky.  But Maggie tells the story of how Lucky added ""fleece"" so he could follow Sonya Lee to school. Lucky discovers that being a lamb isn't half as much fun as being yourself.

MOVIE NIGHT AT FARMER JED'S
Friends Helping Friends - Maggie discovers that she's the star of the first movie.  As all of Discovery City watches Maggie delivering the mail and helping the animals remember who they are, we all rediscover how helpful Maggie is.

The Fast and the Froggy - It's a fast-paced adventure story starring who else?  Eddie and his faithful green sidekick.  One minute they're racing, then hopping and bopping at the garage the next - always looking to discover new adventures.

Feathered and Furry Friends - Big animals or small, Sonya Lee loved them all.  And whether it's baking a cake for Zookeeper Zack's birthday or coaxing chickens off the roof, everyone including Sonya Lee discovers that all animals love her too.

Sarah Lynn's Sing-Along - It's a musical tribute to Sarah Lynn.  She discovers how much everyone appreciates her musical talents, especially when she uses them to help the Captain save his boat or when she shares her music with friends.

Before Your Very Eyes - Everyone at Movie Night discovers once again how handy Michael's creativity can be when the movie projector breaks down.  Then they all get to watch Michael in action on screen - making it rain or snow, you just never know.",1203984000,17,2889,4.541586073500967
2079494,5,B0002DB568,"I wish Little People were this fun when I was a kid.  Back then, they were wooden and didn't have extremities.  Now they're high falootin' with they're own cartoons.  My son loves the Little People DVDs, especially Aaron Neville's opening song--we sing it all the time.  He likes that the cartoons show friendship and kinship among the Little People, and their friendly interactions with animals as well.  These wholesome cartoons are a real treat for my little guy.",1198713600,,466,4.923076923076923
2079495,5,B0002DB568,It's just nice to know your little ones are having fun with something useful and peaceful as the stories in the little people's episodes. Each DVD has 10 different stories that keep them entertained...especially if you're cooking and can't play with them at the time......you know what I mean!,1196208000,,293,5.0
2079496,4,B0002DB568,I like that this CD is divided into two 20 minute chunks and each chunk is divided into five 4 min parts.  This is perfect for when my 20 month old really wants to watch a movie.  She can watch just a little and I can still limit her TV/movie time for the day.  It also is great when I need 5 minutes to finish getting dinner ready and she is starved and impatient.,1178841600,,365,3.9054054054054053
8026612,4,B0002DB568,"They seem like they're going to be dopey and wooden, (plasticky?), with that strange sort of pseudo Claymation kind of look. But, the stories are bright and upbeat and the voices are cheerful and engaging, so that these tales turn out to be comfy, entertaining and kid friendly. These are for quieter times, and are always well liked by the grandkids",1522368000,2,350,4.754098360655738
