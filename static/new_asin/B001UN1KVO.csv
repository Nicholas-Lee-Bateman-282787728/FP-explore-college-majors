This is a really funny and eye-popping movie that kids will love.  There's never a dull moment, the animation is brilliant, and Garfield actually demonstrates some redeeming qualities -- he saves the universe! There's also a really cool game on the DVD called Professor Wally's Moscrambulator. If you're a fan of Garfield, of superheroes, of comic books, this is a great movie for you.",1245196800,10,543,6.742857142857143

3803122,1,B001UN1KVO,"I thought this movie was a sad reflection of our society today.  I was saddened that a movie like this is being seen by children.  I feel this movie should have been rated PG13.  It had violence, burping, and sexy dressed characters.  I was a teacher for many years.  We would show moves that would promote good values with humor to make it fun for the kids.  This move had no message.  Garfield was pictured as lazy.  All he wanted to do was sit and eat.
I give this movie a thumbs down.  If this were the last movie available for a child they would be much better off not seeing any movie!",1444694400,2,591,4.15929203539823

3803135,1,B001UN1KVO,"It's clear that people that make kids movies now a days are out of ideas, and give kids garbage like this.  Whatever happened to the Peanut's movies of yore.  They were great, had meaning, and heart.  But these new kid's shows and movies are just awful.  They are so bad they seem to have been written this way out of spite.  Movies like this one are a death knell for child entertainment.",1387411200,,389,4.347222222222222
3803136,1,B001UN1KVO,This movie wouldn't download so I canceled it. But I see Amazon still charged me for it. I think I'll switch to Redbox since this is the second time I paid for movies in error without any recourse.,1383436800,,197,4.2105263157894735
3803137,1,B001UN1KVO,"My children started watching this on Netflix and by some miracle was removed.  Several months later, my son asked to watch it, and my wife bought it.

Do yourself a favor and never let your children see this movie.  Poorly animated, poorly written and directed.  Even the voice acting is lack luster.  It's at best a glorified fan made movie.",1373587200,,342,4.633333333333334
3803138,5,B001UN1KVO,"Nice cartoon. The 3d was alright, but the cartoon was good regardless. So it's alright and for the price good to have in your collection to have some good entertainment without having to worry a whole lot about what ya'll kids are watching.",1370476800,4,240,4.604651162790698

3803141,4,B001UN1KVO,"Garfield's Pet Force is based on the paperback books by Garfield's creator Jim Davis and is more action-packed than the previous Garfield outings. Here we get Garfield and Friends teaming up with superheros to stop an evil baddie and her army of zombies from taking over the world.

Garfield's Pet Force is a fun movie for the entire family.",1346803200,7,341,4.779661016949152

3803144,5,B001UN1KVO,"And isn't that the point of a movie like this?!?  Read and look at the case before you purchase; It clearly shows red and green tinted glasses meaning it is anaglyph!  It also states: ""The 3D glasses provided are all you need to enjoy this 3D DVD experience-no other special equipment or TV is required."".  Anaglyphic 3D has never been perfect be it at the theater or at home, it's kind of why they've moved away from it with modern 3D techniques; That being said all you have to do is tinker with your picture settings (just like you've always had to do with anaglyph) and you can get a pretty decent ""old school"" 3D effect.  Will this replace your 3D Blu-rays?  No of course not.

I'm not sure what the going rate for this was before but now it can be had for $5 in the bargain bins at Wal-mart so you really can't go wrong!

P.S. The film is also presented in 2D so it isn't like it is a total waste to just buy this version whether the 3D wows you or not!",1332979200,,959,4.123655913978495
3803145,5,B001UN1KVO,"After renting this movie from the video store 3 times for our son, we decided it made sense to own it so he could have it available all the time.  He loves this show.  Still watches a lot even after 2 months.  Definately worth it.",1279411200,,230,4.066666666666666
3803146,5,B001UN1KVO,Great my seven year old loves it!  He reads the comics and the videos help keep him interested in reading more.,1258329600,,111,4.285714285714286
3803147,4,B001UN1KVO,"This DVD is well-done as you might expect of Garfield.  The story line revolving around Garfield and pals living out the ending to the comic book they were reading is clever.  Also, the fact that the superhero's that come to Earth have the heads of Garfield and pals, yet are muscular or elastic in body was quite funny to my kids.

Overall a very entertaining, funny DVD.

The one and only drawback I see is the use of the terms ""shut up"" and ""this sucks"" by the characters.  If you have younger children and these are not phrase you'd like them to pick up, then you may either want to screen the movie first to skip those parts or avoid it altogether.

Still a huge fan Garfield, but next time clean it up just a bit so I can allow my kids to watch without any fear of inappropriate phrases.",1253577600,3,793,4.253333333333333
3803148,4,B001UN1KVO,"My kids found this movie to be entertaining and funny.  I liked the story.  Good triumphs over evil is always a winner for me.  The notion of Garfield and his friends actually living out the ending to the comic book they're reading is a good concept.

Some of the slapstick was funny to my kids.  And the fact that the superhero's from the other planet look like Garfield, Odie, Nermal, and Arlene in the face was humorous for them.

However, I would prefer that my kids not watch movies where the character's say ""shut up"" and that something ""sucks"".  So be aware that there are a few instances of these statements.

Bottom line - entertaining and funny?  Yes.  Language appropriate for a 6 or 8 year old?  No.",1253491200,,711,4.4765625
3803149,4,B001UN1KVO,"This movie is completely innane, but my kids love it. I was a little surprised at its G rating--I would save this movie for older children (the villian says ""shut up"" which I think is inappropriate for young children and the tension/violence is a little scary for younger children, etc.) Unfortunately, if your kids see this once, they'll want to see it again and again.",1246060800,6,370,4.707692307692308
