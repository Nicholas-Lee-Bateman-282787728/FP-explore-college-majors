And for that reason, I'm giving this DVD two stars (rather than just one) but only because the words of the sages/gurus featured in this DVD are worth at least that. I should have paid more attention to the cover: it's a fairly accurate representation of the quality (or, rather, lack thereof) of the production lurking inside. If I had paid attention to the cover, I would have passed on this... as I should have.

Add to the jaw-dropping poor quality of this production (amateurish and nearly unreadable opening credits, uneven audio levels... the list goes on and on) the embarrassing attempts to string the whole thing together with a plot featuring Maura, (one of the producers - who's also credited as ""host"" - and who really and truly cannot act), and the result is laughable at best.

I still haven't figured out the closing scene where the ""host"" Maura returns home (I think it's her home... she's never been here before, but she sure looks like she's home) and greets a man and a woman, and it appears that they are in a ""relationship."" I don't have a problem with polyamory or whatever this ""relationship"" is supposed to be... I have a problem with it being dropped into the end of this whacked-out production without a set-up.

I usually like to share my collection of CDs and DVDs with my friends who share an interest in all things spiritual, but there is no way I can seriously show this to friends (unless we need a reason to laugh). That's the only thing preventing me from returning it to Amazon: I figure it may be good for a few laughs someday, or as a white elephant/gag gift.

I'm sorry I couldn't be more positive in my review, but my path asks me to be honest and reality-based. And quite honestly, this was truly awful. Please save your money and buy a book, CD or DVD from Adyashanti or Eckhart Tolle: you'll get much more out of it, you won't be distracted by the jaw-dropping poor production values, and you'll likely save some money in the bargain.

As for the other, much more positive reviews here, I'd suggest you take any review written in ALL CAPS with several large grains of salt. I know I will, going forward..",1284595200,2,2262,4.561576354679803

Wherever you are on your spiritual journey, you will enjoy this unique video.  I definitely recommend it.",1196985600,5,283,4.6938775510204085
