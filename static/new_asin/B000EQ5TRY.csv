8112789,3,B000EQ5TRY,Thought this dvd was ok. One thing I noticed was the voices sound a little different. Not sure if its different people doing the voices or what. But my 3 yr old twins noticed and I think that is why they didn't want to watch it....like saying hey this is not the same!,1389052800,,268,4.0754716981132075
8112790,5,B000EQ5TRY,"I've been a big fan of Fairly Oddparents from the very beginning and this was one of my favorite episodes. I love that Norm MacDonald voices Norm the Genie. He's perfect for the role and he does a great job! Also, American Idol's Diana Degarmo, the runner up in season 3, makes a guest voice appearance as Cosmo's singing voice, which is hilarious. She's got a beautiful voice but seeing it come out of Cosmo is so funny. There are two extra episodes on the disk, I wish there were more. But, you get two hours of Fairly Oddparents entertainment so I think it's worth it, especially since they don't really show this on TV much anymore considering it's a one hour special. I'd recommend it to any Fairly Oddparents fan, though I think fans of Norm MacDonald or Diana Degarmo would enjoy it as well.",1377993600,,798,4.472602739726027

8112792,3,B000EQ5TRY,"Here is the Episode lowdown:

Fairy Idol: I think this tv-movie is a good tv-movie, except the lawn gnomes, Timmy's Mr. Crocker costume, and uh..........Chester McBadbat's 3 wishes that makes things go from good to bad to worse and back to good again.

Truth or Cosmoquenses: (a la the Comic Book Guy from ""The Simpsons"") Worst episode ever. The walls that you can ""Poof"" in and out of suck! Timmy drinking lemonade, holding it in for most of the entire episode, Cosmo and Wanda Drinking Timmy's pee and Wandisomo putting the moves on Wanda!

Timmy TV: Yeah, this episode's good! I like timmy saying, ""What could possibly go wrong!""

If you don't like this DVD, avoid it and don't buy it! But if you do, go ahead and buy this (guitar rift) DVD!",1161043200,2,744,4.571428571428571
