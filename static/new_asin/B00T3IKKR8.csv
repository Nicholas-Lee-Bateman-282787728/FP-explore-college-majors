6998967,5,B00T3IKKR8,I watched this episode today and it was absolutely spellbinding!  I am a lover of this series and this was the best episode yet.  I am very anxious to see Season 4 which starts this Sunday.,1427155200,10,189,4.222222222222222
6998968,5,B00T3IKKR8,This series I believe is the best yet. The new cast have fitted in effortlessly as if they'd been in all the series up till now. I'm sure the U.S. fans will love this too. Can't wait for the Christmas episode new series next year.,1426723200,27,230,4.133333333333334
6998969,5,B00T3IKKR8,"I was a little afraid that the loss of Jenny and the moving into a new decade would somehow diminish this spellbinding show. But having just finished the season here in the UK, I can honestly say to all the American fans that CTM just seems to get better and better. The final episode, I will admit, caused a single tear. Moving, thought-provoking and above all simply awe inducing. The way that generation soldered on in spite of everything that we today would find devastating, is just inspiring beyond any simple review.",1425945600,87,523,4.695652173913044

This gives us information about how difficult life was after World War 2 and the challenges facing the populace.  The acting is fabulous.  The compassion shown by the sisters and midwives is so uplifting and the stories of the people  they treated and cared for, laughed and cried with are heart warming and heart wrenching. Don't miss this series.  Start with Season 1 and if you don't shed a few tears every episode I will be surprised as you see the courage, caring, tenacity of all those involved.

The leaving of Jessica Raine  was a clear loss the show.  I just can't get use to Trixie Franklin (Helen George) as the lead character now.  There is just something about her I don't like.  Some of the episodes seem a little two preachy to me. It seem with Raine's leaving the show is just not the same.",1462579200,,467,4.25

I believe the author of the book it was based on has died and it appears the series was popular enough to continue on with the story line.  My daughter-in-law is British and introduced me to the story by sending Season 1,2, and 3 over the last couple of years.

6999133,5,B00T3IKKR8,This show is amazing.,1452556800,,21,4.5
6999134,5,B00T3IKKR8,"Call the Midwife didn't sound very appealing when I  heard about it just before its first season was shown on PBS: midwives delivering babies in an East London slum in the 1950s was far removed from my normal television fare.  But I gave it a try and was hooked from the first episode by the magnificent acting, beautiful scripts, and the human drama of the midwives of Nonnatus House and their patients.  My favorite character was always Nurse Jenny, who was based on the late Jennifer Worth whose memoirs inspired the series.  When Jenny left the show after the third season I was prepared for a decline in quality.

I can assure you that there has been no decline.  Jenny's replacement is just as appealing, as are all the other denizens of Nonnatus House, both old and new.  The midwives are calm and competent in dealing with the women and babies of the East End, but they are also dealing with their own dramas.  Sister Julienne is the cool headed leader of the midwives, but in Season 4 she encounters an old friend who rattles her composure.  Nurse Trixie hopes she has found her true love, but realizes she must step back and rethink before making a final decision. Sister Evangelina has to admit that her own health problems need to be dealt with, then finds she has a strong minded rival in Nurse Crane, who strides into Nonnatus House and begins setting things ""right"".  And Nurse Crane herself reveals her own vulnerabilities as well.

As always, Call the Midwife is a beautiful and moving viewing experience.  Season 4 includes all seven episodes plus a Christmas special, in which we are allowed glimpses of an elderly Jennifer Worth deciding to write the memoirs on which the series is based.  I trust Call the Midwife will have many seasons to come.",1452384000,,1766,4.658064516129032
6999135,5,B00T3IKKR8,"What a joy!  Every bit as entertaining, endearing, and thought-provoking as previous seasons.  The characters are engaging, the plots seem natural and sometimes unpredictable.

6999186,1,B00T3IKKR8,"I wish I could post deficit stars on this season.  What an ugly mess the writers left us with in season 4 after such a beautiful, fun, light-hearted and sensitive start.  The family should sue them and PBS for defamation of character.  In this dreary season all the bright fun and heart has been buried under a pile of political comment.  The original beautiful memoirs have been hijacked by the writers, and apparently with the blessing of PBS, to force feed their immoral political views on an unsuspecting public.  If you have a bleeding heart for the ugly world of prostitution and aren't the least disturbed by a prostitute choosing to raise her baby in a whorehouse, then you're going to love this.  Never mind the sexual scene between  two men; lesbianism and the destruction, one by one, of the characters we so fondly embraced in seasons 1 through 3 is all part of season 4 fare. All those lovable characters from seasons past have either fled or been demonized by dirty little secrets and skeletons that taint the fun right out of them.  The Christmas show was the ONLY episode with any redeeming qualities, in spite of the panicked flight of half the cast that made this show so special in previous seasons.  With  the addition of the only sweet new character, I can't even remember her name, there are so many, I ALMOST thought it was going to get back on track.  I can't believe the number of 5 star ratings for this travesty.  Every time a show out there takes this course, it tanks badly---as did this one.  Either there aren't enough liberals who go along with this kind of agenda or even they themselves become nauseous with and choke on their own offerings.  Why can't entertainment just be entertainment instead of a soapbox for the writer's personal disturbed ideas?",1445472000,10,1786,4.664536741214057

And the writing is fantastic.  I as a guy will gladly give up on any sporting event to see this, and I love hockey.  The mixtures of heartbreaking moments like what happens to Nurse Patsy to laughter with Sister Monica Jone is perfect.  If you have seen any of the previous seasons, you know your getting pure gold.  It is mature subject matter, but it is the joys and lows of life.  It is a true must for fans and for people who love acting at it's best.",1442793600,,625,4.099173553719008

6999224,5,B00T3IKKR8,"I binge watched all 4 seasons this summer and liked season 4 even better than the first three seasons:  a mix of happy and sad endings.  I thought the characters have become ""rounder:"" even lovely people can reveal small mindedness and have blind spots.  Even smart people can do the wrong thing.  Women had it hard and were bossed around a lot, no matter how competent.  So it's interesting to see these characters grappling with life and not always being perfect and rosy.  As for complaints from some viewers about including characters and situations who are LGBT, I thought that it was well-integrated into the storylines and had nothing to do with promoting a PC agenda.  Do you think that there weren't people of all kinds in the 50s and 60s?  I just wish that they'd give the Trixie character a better love interest than the curate.  His character has never shown that he understands HER or does anything that she likes -he never listens/asks what she thinks--she must buck up and learn to like what he likes and understand HIM.  I hope she gets well and gives him the old heave ho permanently and not because she thinks she isn't good enough for him but because he isn't good enough for her.

And while I have still enjoyed season 4 and cannot fault the acting, the production, and the costumes and set, there is a sharp contrast from the previous seasons where the writing is concerned.

I was actually quite surprised by how politically correct some of the episodes were (namely, episode 3), especially in a series that was a master in the art of simply telling a story (based on an actual memoir!) and then letting the viewer decide where they stood on the issues that were presented. The episodes were complex and left you with much to think about.

This season, however, reminded me of an after-school special that TELLS the audience what to think through a very heavy-handed and unrealistic script. It disappointed me. I'm still a fan, but I wish the writers had not felt the need to opine so obviously.",1439856000,12,889,4.759740259740259

Season 4 has maintained the high standards of the the other three seasons. These stories avoid the shopworn cliches: no ""special effects,"" not a single AK47 goes off nor does any vehicle go exploding off a cliff. These are solid three dimensional dramas that highlight the trials, tribulations and triumphs of the profession of midwifery. The stories  take unexpected turns and remind us of what it means to be fully human in the most positive sense of the term.",1439510400,3,622,4.803738317757009

What I most admire is how the handle sexism and racism without putting a modern spin on it.  The people smoke, especially the doctors, and they treat people according to gender but you can feel the future beginning to happen.  The episode about the man kissing a man in a public toilet was heart breaking but it ended as well as it could and you saw where Britain and the rest of the world was going.  My wife and I both commented on how wonderful the nuns and the lay mid wives interact and it feels like a toast to an early non nameable feminism.

6999560,5,B00T3IKKR8,"Consistently excellent all 'round, I was a bit worried when this series evolved beyond the perils of WWII and into the sixties.  A needless concern:  the situations are still tightly wound, the compassion genuine, the needs still there just in different iterations.  Without question, a series that exceeds theater length film in every quality and, I hope, is widely watched and appreciated.",1435276800,,391,5.274193548387097

6999572,2,B00T3IKKR8,"Episode 4 was truly one of my favorites, and I did shed some tears, but I can't say the same for episode 6.  What distracted from the sweetness of the gypsy part of the episode were the over-riding theme of abortion, which was apparently forced on a young woman who wanted to keep her child - and why couldn't the medical community and church have rallied around her  (which they have succeeded in doing in previous complex pregnancies in this show), in her desire to preserve her baby's life?  What sort of ""choice"" was that?  Also, was the more insidious theme of lesbianism between two of the nurses which is detracts and detracts from the simplicity and sweetness of this season.",1435017600,6,683,4.619834710743802

So many things to take away from the show...the strength of women, the pros and cons of government run health care, the changes in women's health and delivery practices as well as baby care, the conditions of the poor s than, but at times the conditions are clear) and a positive example of Christian religious life and faith.  I have learned from the quiet and beautiful narrations (by Vanessa Redgrave - who also appears in the 2014 Christmas special which is part of this season), the examples of the women (and men) and the words of wisdom and faith (especially uttered by Sister Juliane) and the beautiful words of the songs sung by the Sisters in (almost) every episode.

As a long-time nurse, I love the stories of this intrepid group of care providers who brought healthcare to the poorest people in London in the 50's and 60's. The portrayals of life, birth, often in difficult surroundings, are realistic, and awe-inspiring.  I have the whole series, and would recommend it unreservedly.

As soon as it was advertised this season could be pre-ordered, I did that and it came just a few days after the release date.  I've played this thru about 3 or 4 times and I am going to ""put it to rest"" for a while.  I am also in health care and I love seeing how things were done in healthcare in earlier times.

The plots were all esp good except for the whole accident amnesia thing and the alcoholics anon moment. (The character does not seem like an alcoholic just depressed.)

Some hints to tide people over
Episode 1 Children in trouble, and a new nurse, and a delivery in a car.
Episode 2 One of the sisters has health issues, and Trixie is engaged.
Episode 3 Dr. Turner has an outbreak of disintary, and Nurse Crane has a mysterious patient.
Episode 4 Sister Winifred educates women about syphilis, and a father is worried his unborn child won't be a boy.
episode five Dr. Turner overworked, and Sheila takes some of his patients. Sister Monica Jone helps in a surprising way.
Episode six Diabetic teenager, and a gypsy caravan cause a fuss.
Episode seven A fire at the maternity home, and a mix-up for sister Evangelina.
And finally episode eight, Two nurses plan to move in together, and a deaf lady worries about her child. Very sad ending.
Food for thought, the lady playing the deaf mother really is deaf, she had to learn sixties British sign language, she can only lip-read in real life. Genevieve Barr is her name, she was in The Silence, where she played a signing teenager.
Of course, there's more to all these episodes, but I don't tell people everything. Hope this helps.",1428624000,55,1148,4.6048780487804875

Like so many other British productions, this series takes ""little"" stories, adds more little stories and more little stories until you really get to know and care about the characters. I particularly like the explanation of how strong all the English, but especially the women, had to be after the end of WWII. Thanks for making this available.",1428537600,7,518,4.5212765957446805

6999775,5,B00T3IKKR8,"As usual this is a top notch episode in keeping with the high quality of the entire series so far. I thought I wouldn't enjoy it anymore after the departure of Jessica Raine as Nurse Lee, but this wonderful show has been able to endure the leaving of a major character without missing a beat. The story lines continue to be interesting and heart warming and the attention to period detail is astonishing in it's accuracy. I purchased this episode in HD  quality and  the picture is absolutely crisp and gorgeous. The Christmas reds really pop out. Love this show.",1428278400,4,563,4.62

6999783,5,B00T3IKKR8,"One of the finest productions ever created.  The characters and their story lines are well developed.  Each year I have wondered if the producers and writers will be able to sustain the quality of the production, and I lament the changing of characters, but have found that every new season is as good as the last, and each new character is just as memorable as those who are no longer featured.  I like the mood that is maintained through the episodes with the background of time-appropriate choices of music.  The attention to detail with the costuming and set design is superb.  I highly recommend this series.",1428019200,15,613,4.745283018867925

6999786,5,B00T3IKKR8,"Finished watching Call the Midwife and this season is as good or better than previous seasons. The new additions to the cast did not affect the show's storytelling in any way. In fact, the show was bittersweet as it depicted the joys of bringing in a new life while showing what happens when children left to live in neglect.

Both the lay midwives and the sister midwives have their personal issues dealt with in the show. In the episode I watched one of the lay midwives became engaged and one of the sister midwives dealt with health issues.

As always the show is storytelling an its best and I always feel uplifted after viewing Call the Midwife.

The above review was written after watching the first show of the season shown in the US.

Highly recommend.",1427846400,15,761,4.573529411764706

Series 4, episode 1 is wonderful. Just watch one episode, you'll see! We own the first 3 Series DVDs and have watched them several times. You never get tired of watching this drama. Jump right in on Series 4. You can go back and watch the other Series, cause you will be hooked on it just like everyone else!",1427587200,14,475,4.288888888888889
6999788,5,B00T3IKKR8,"I am a regular watcher of this series.  I cannot imagine why it does not get mentioned in Emmy season.

I missed this episode (Christmas Special 2014) when it was televised a few months ago.  It is just right.

Amazon's streaming service for PCs does not work correctly until or unless Silverlight starts; if you have problems with Silverlight, Amazon has a procedure to restore it.  The demise of Unbox means that I will not be downloading Amazon Instant Video for a while, only streaming.

Rumor has it that Amazon is working on a Windows app of some sort.

Unbox turns back into a pumpkin at the stroke of midnight, Cinderella.

It sent me ""down the rabbit hole"" searching for more information about the East end and its history. There are many other books that deal with people's lives during WWII in Britain. Knowing how the poor lived in the East end amidst bombed out buildings from that war, it made me wonder about how the British dealt with war coming to their homes. Fred lost his family due to the Blitz. He is a real person in Jennifer's memoirs. If you learn about the background of this area of London, then the story is richer and you understand the people a lot more.",1514419200,,668,4.528925619834711

8700130,3,B00T3IKKR8,"I have purchased all of the previous three seasons to watch over and over... and maybe over again...
Some have praised the departure from Jennifer Worth's books, I agree with those who feel the transition was a bit shocking.
Part of the charm of Jennifer's books were that they were about young women finding their way in a changed world while serving the poorest of us.
The one exception is the Christmas episode because both Cynthia and Chummy remain.
Understandably, as Trixie becomes more experienced, she looses a bit of this charm. However, the additional characters brought in don't really help. Barbara is a bit flat - I feel like she was designed to take Jenny's place, but we don't get to know her as well (partly because the story continues to be narrated by ""Older Jenny"" which honestly feels a bit of a let down.
Patsy introduces a different yibe into things - I guess it is the 1960s, but part of the charm of the stories were the innocence ""men were things you married"", and with her needing to hide her sexuality it feels a bit darker than the generally light hearted flirtations enjoyed by the nurses in the previous three seasons - yes you definitely see some hard things, but the nurses stories - with the exception of Alec - helped add a positive note to some otherwise pretty depressing stories - the writers struggle to find the balance this year.
Nurse Crane just feels wrong. She feels like she fits in better with the nuns than the young girls, and perhaps it would make sense, but she definitely fails to uphold the young. She is finding her way, but she seems just a bit TOO sure of herself.
 More than Jenny, I really, truly miss Chummy - and even Peter. They added a sweet human element of pursuit of happiness and overcoming ones childhood that is so human the show really isn't the same without it.
I continue to watch, but for free during the season rather than every six months as with these first seasons.",1506556800,2,1939,4.54
