8626839,5,B00284BVJA,"Wonderful look into waitresses' lives and what a tough job waiting tables is. I especially resonated with Sonya Fairbanks' story about the rude customer who, as it turned out, was a patron and follower of her art. She was very well-spoken and revealed the irony of this and the spiritual hutzpah it takes to do such a job.",1467676800,,322,4.568965517241379
8626840,5,B00284BVJA,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this excellent documentary had made it to DVD...I've been wearing out a couple of VHS copies that I'd taped from cable.

American Waitress: New Mexico follows four waitresses through their work day and off hours: Lillian Beams, Sonya Fairbanks, Sherry McElwan, and Karen Webb. There are many other waitresses who appear in snippets throughout the program, but these are the central characters, covered in the most depth.

Lillian wears a ""Betty Boop"" wig and outfit in her ""theme"" restaurant, and in her off hours visits the local tattoo parlor to plan her next session. She's tuned in to customers and her interaction with them...she tells the story of one customer, early in her tenure, who accused her of being a racist. The accusation seemed to genuinely upset her, and even after apologies were made on all sides, the fact that it happened at all still seems to trouble her.

Sonya is an artist who seems to have gained greater fame and recognition since the documentary was filmed. She discusses her art at length and the suicide of a friend, which had a profound impact to the commitment she's made to her art.

Sherry, I don't know...maybe she just doesn't come across well on film. She seems to be the compete opposite of a ""people person,"" relating an anecdote in which she mocks a customer that she found a little less than ""with it."" She goes dove hunting with her boyfriend and her dogs and may impress you as the best friend you've always wanted to meet, but I found her to be extremely unpleasant, sarcastic, and anti-social. She even mentions the fact that she lives out in the middle of nowhere because she and her boyfriend don't like being around people...sort of an odd mindset for someone who chose waitressing as a career.

Karen's a real character, a force to be reckoned with in the community. She aggressively works on behalf of local charities. The locals all seem to love her. The story she relates of her daughter is sad, and she chokes up a bit while telling it. She's also very honest about the fact that being a isn't for everyone...it is mentally and physically demanding, and can be financially rewarding, but there are people who should just not even consider it as a career path.

The waitresses are all candid, open, honest, some with a fondness and high regard for their customers, others with a sense of disdain. Sometimes their attitude comes from experiences, which they relate. Other times it's just the way they choose to see people...glass half empty or glass half full. Sometimes...but not all of the times...people are as good or bad as you think they are, you know?

All in all, it is a real and resonating look at American icons who are often ignored or disrespected as they serve the perpetually on-the-go members of our society.

Very highly recommended, five stars all the way.",1268611200,5,2867,4.742971887550201
