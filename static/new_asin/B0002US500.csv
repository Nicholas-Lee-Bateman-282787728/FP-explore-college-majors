2123674,5,B0002US500,"Every therapist should have this DVD. It gives a great amout of knowledge for beginners and advanced therapists as well. Lots of techniques described in detalis, supported with very good explanations.",1220227200,4,200,5.483870967741935
2123675,4,B0002US500,"As a beginner, I thought by ordering this DVD I would have a jump start on CST or a better understanding of this modality. I've watched the DVD several times and have learned more and more each time however, when I tried to practice using the same techniques I felt I was not getting  the results that was shown on the DVD I even had tremendous trouble manipulating and feeling  the pulse. This instructional DVD's makes an excellent addition to a Cranial-Sacral Therapist who is instructing a class.",1188000000,9,500,4.670454545454546
2123676,5,B0002US500,"This DVD is very well done. Mary Sullivan has presented the historical background and some of the treatment techniques of cranio sacral therapy in an informative and understandable manner. The different cranio sacral release techniques are explained in a manner that both novices and CST practitioners will derive benefit from. The material is suitable for those just getting started w/CST practice, but an advanced therapist will also learn new techniques/approaches as well. Recently let an interested patient borrow it after their request to understand CST further. She LOVED it. Stated it really helped her gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the skills involved. Just had  a manual therapy colleague preview it and they found it very informative without being overly technical. I'm a CST with an Upledger Institute background and found the DVD well done also. Mary's enthusiasm for the topic is obvious and the graphics, anatomical images and camera work all bring the materials to life. I would buy it again in a second.",1173916800,31,1038,5.253012048192771
2123677,3,B0002US500,Don't go anywhere near this DVD unless you're a CS practitioner. Way too involved. Mea culpa...,1167004800,7,95,5.0
2123678,5,B0002US500,"I was fascinated with cranial-sacral therapy and bought a book from Amazon on this subject to do some self-study. But I found it is hard to understand. When Amazon introduced me this DVD, I decided to buy it. Now I can grasped the basic techniques on this therapy because of the help of this DVD.",1162684800,18,296,4.4
2123679,3,B0002US500,"To those of you that aren't familiar with cranialsacral therapy, this is a type of therapy that is controversial even among osteopaths. It was developed by Sutherland who thought that the sutures in one's cranium can be moved ( this a very controversial idea because the current thought among physicians and anatomists is that the cranial sutures are immobile). Sutherland hypothesized that by manipulating the cranial bones the physician can influence cerebrospinal fluid motion (another very controversial idea) and thus, influence health. This video uses alot of Upledger's vault holds( which is not surprising since Upledger teaches many non-osteopaths CST), instead of the classical Sutherland vault hold. The video,surprisingly, glosses over the CV4 technique which is a very powerful treatment modality and the equally important sacral techniques. I also don't understand why Sullivan cautions against using CST in hypertensives since hypertension is a sympathetic response and CST stimulates the parasympathetic system. This to me would seem that CST should actually help in hypertension and not worsen it. Otherwise, it's not a bad video and it provides a good starting point in CST.",1075507200,13,1192,5.554945054945055
2123680,5,B0002US500,"This is a great video- the graphics are amazing and the techniques clearly shown. I have studied various cranial techniques- and this video brings together various perspectives (ie. Upledger, Becker, Milne and others). It is well- rounded and a great contribution to the field of cranial therapy. I would recommend it to any massage therapist or bodyworker- it is too advanced for the general public.",1036886400,19,400,5.1692307692307695

8032661,4,B0002US500,"Ordered this to help me move towards more subtle work in my practice. My sense is that it is a good primer for anyone trained in massage or body-work. Certainly helps to have some prior study of anatomy/physiology, and, goes almost without saying, that there's no substitute for experiential learning with a well trained instructor, especially for modalities that involve such subtle nuances and require deeper palpation skills. That said, Mary is a great instructor, the video renderings of anatomical structures and hand positions are very helpful, and there are even some more advanced tidbits thrown in here and there. Recommended as a primer and reference for beginners.",1349308800,,675,5.2592592592592595
8032662,5,B0002US500,"Although I have a long-standing interest in many forms of energy work, having both studied it extensively and experienced it numerous times, I am not a professional therapist. So when I decided I wanted to learn more about cranial-sacral therapy, I knew I wanted something that was detailed and informative, but also clearly presented. I was not disappointed!! Mary Sullivan gives explanations of the theory and techniques of CST that are detailed but clearly understandable, even for a beginner. I particularly found the use of 3-dimensional transparent views in this video to be immensely helpful. For example: when the practitioner is shown working on a client who is lying face-up, images of both the client's spine and the practitioner's hands (which are underneath the client) are superimposed in transparent fashion. Similarly, one is able to view images of the bones of the skull. I found this to be much more helpful than any books and/or drawings I had seen. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to learn more about the theory and practice of CST.",1232236800,17,1076,5.016759776536313
