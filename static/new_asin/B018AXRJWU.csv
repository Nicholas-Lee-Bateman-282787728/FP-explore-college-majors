8741933,2,B018AXRJWU,"This is a German made TV mini series filmed in Turkey about an Italian toy maker and badly dubbed in English. I think ,most us know the story. This one includes the whale ending, the mules, and Coco the wood cricket. It was geared for a very young audience, maybe about 5 years old. It doesn't have much in the way of adult appeal. If you have seen the old Disney version, or not, watch it again instead.

Not watchable for adults.",1448236800,2,431,4.2560975609756095
