The gripping comentary held me to my seat and would recommend this movie to anyone.",1031875200,,245,4.674418604651163
7794108,5,0967971403,"It is good to see that the story of Margaret Corbin has been told once again. Her story is truly amazing and should be told through film and imagery. I find it difficult to imagine what it was really like when reading it in a book. This film was truly helpful in portraying such a compelling story. Thank You Mr. Matzner, a job well done.",1029369600,,338,4.2153846153846155
7794109,5,0967971403,"I have seen this video and it is an excellent portrayal of the life of America's first woman soldier. It recreates her life from childhood to her untimely death. She fought at the Battle of Ft. Washington in the American Revolution serving her husband's cannon after he was killed. She was wounded in the battle. She was the first woman to be formally enrolled in the American Army. She was the first woman to receive a soldier's discharge and to be buried at West Point.
  This video is in vivid color. It has a good musical score. The cast is huge. I highly recommend this video to anyone with an interest in the role of a woman in America's early history. I give this video five stars.",1026172800,,688,4.409448818897638
7794110,5,0967971403,"This is an exhilirating movie about a little known subject of the American Revolution, the pride of American Females and the bane of all English, Terrorists, and Cockroaches, the first armed housewife.  All those interested in 22 min. narrated documentary's will surely enjoy this film, from the comfort of your own armchair you can watch in it's astounding glory as Mr. Matzner tells us the intriging story of a short event in one of the pivotal battles of the war for our freedom, complete with period maps and engaging shots of reenactments of British and American field actions.",1025222400,,582,4.938775510204081
7794111,4,0967971403,"Dear Mr. Matzner,
  I would like to commend you for your film ""Margaret Corbin, America's First Heroine,"" which I consider to be outstanding work. As a woman, I found it particularly interesting to learn about such a remarkable figure in our history, of whom I was not previously aware. Well done.
Best Wishes,
Allison Carhart",1024531200,,326,4.909090909090909
7794112,2,0967971403,"This film only runs about 22 minutes, but it still felt about ten minutes too long.
The film recounts the actions of Corbin during the Revolution in an attempt to be educational, although it wants to be more. Part educational, part dramatization, part re-enactment, part tribute; the film has elements of all, but does not quite succeed at any.
The production values are fairly poor, and range from ""home made"" to dull instructional film. In fact, that was what I was reminded of most while watching it; the films or filmstrips we used to watch in grade school before the advent of video players in the classroom. This may be because the film is aimed at a student level, rather than towards a broader audience. Partly to blame is the narration, which I personally found to be rather boring.
The project is obviously dated, and was probably made well before videotape editing was widely available to the public (it looks to be pre-1980, but that's just a guess). The footage is shot on what appears to be standard 8mm film (possibly 16mm, perhaps both). One problem here is the larger grain with these type of film stocks, which can affect sharpness. Also, the exposure settings used in some segments of the film vary in accuracy. Another issue is the age of the original film itself. Over time, the color saturation in older film tends to fade, leading to a ""washed out"" spectrum.
The end result renders the darks of the film too muddy, the brights too contrasty, and the available spectrum limited (reds and blues are strong, greens are not). Regrettably, transferring the film to video only exacerbates these problems.
At present, there do not appear to be any other Corbin documentaries available on video, which is unfortunate. Although this documentary has some merit, I honestly feel that the viewer would be better off waiting for a History Channel special or Biography video to be released.
Hard-core historians and Revolutionary War buffs will most likely find this to be a disappointing purchase, despite the interesting subject of Corbin.",1011830400,,2050,4.89367816091954
