2319350,5,B0009U5FPG,My daughter loves the Bratz and the DVD is great. She sings ( or trys to sing) every song. The movie is great for rides in the car or just to chill at home and enjoy. My daughter is 2 and has been watching Bratz since she was 1. Yea she is a Brat too. A must have for little girls.,1366934400,,281,3.622950819672131
2319351,3,B0009U5FPG,"the movie is amazing for  ages 8 and up. there are great  lyrics and great funny lines. but sometimes the clothing is inapropiate for younger ages. i know several 5 year olds who want a belly piercing and tattoos after watching brats genies. and i know one 9 year old who had a boy friend in the 1st,2nd,and 3rd grade. overall its okay.",1336435200,,336,4.317460317460317

2319353,5,B0009U5FPG,"This movie is excellent and it's about 4 fashionable girls including Yasmin, Sasha, Jade and Cloe. And it has new people including Roxxi. And the boys are here to Dylan and Cameron!! And it comes with a bonus Bratz Episode Crush in a Rush. I've had this dvd since 2005 or so. And it's still awesome!!!",1248998400,,301,4.392857142857143
2319354,5,B0009U5FPG,"The plot is interesting, so you won't forget about this movie after watching it once.  And the kids will sing the songs from it, because they are catchy.  No offensive language(except says ""barfomania"" once), is witty and promotes kindness and friendship.  Good family movie altogether.",1175990400,2,286,5.311111111111111
2319355,5,B0009U5FPG,"The movie is about four girls that have their own magazine. The characters are cloe,Yasinmn,Sasha and Jade. It takes place at the mall. I like the movie because it has interesting charcters. Another reason I like bratz,is because they have clothes that I like. Girls would like this movie because it has shopping and it is about friendship.",1160438400,,340,4.879310344827586
2319356,4,B0009U5FPG,"As a Mama I was worried that it wasn't approriate for my 7 soon to be 8 year old. However when I listened to the cd, I enjoyed it. The songs are about girls strengths and being able to think for themselves and to believe in one's self. And to enjoy life.",1140220800,7,254,3.9038461538461537
2319357,1,B0009U5FPG,"Having trawled through 200+ reviews on this film, I've come to the conclusion that Bratz obviously retards the intelligence of those that collect them. At least 40% of the reviews on here are repeats, 5% seem to be about the movie and the rest is Bratz and My Scene fans calling each other names, with the Bratz fans making the dumbest statements.

Face it, you whinge about Barbie being a bad example for the young, but honestly the Bratz tagline is 'girls with a passion for fashion and boys' So the only important things in life are clothes and dating, hey if that ain't sexism what is? At least barbie (not my scene) got to be a doctor.",1136592000,9,640,4.423728813559322
2319358,3,B0009U5FPG,"This is not a bad movie, but it's not exactly a good movie either. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed it. Also, please don't review a movie if you haven't seen the movie. It's not fair to people who are looking for ratings based on people who have actually seen the movie.",1134518400,4,268,4.173076923076923
2319359,1,B0009U5FPG,"This moivie is about the Bratz girls (Yasmin,Jade,Cloe and Shasha) who start there own little magazine company and they head of to London with there to boy friends Dylan and the blonde (What are the Bratz doing double dating?!) to go to a punk consert and interview a guy on some made up show called American Rocks (what a dumb name!). How ever the Bratz enemys the Twibles (Kassie and Kurtsi) and Burden Maxwell want to steel the Bratz tickets to the punk concert and the interview to meet the American Rocks dude.
  Well this isn't my movie It's my nine year old sisters. She is a freak for Bratz. The reason I seirously hate this movie is it is not kid friendly. I mean the skirts they wear is like at the level of there under wear. And I have never seen a v-cut in a TV show as deep as the ones they wear in my life. Their cloths are sooooooooo tight to! I mean ever since my sister saw this movie when we go shopping for cloths she chooses out these super tight cloths because the Bratz wear them. Also they dress like a gothic person! Some of their belly shirts are sleeve less (belly shirts with out sleeves can you see your child wearing one)!
  Another bad thing is the way they act. They act all crazy over boys! I mean I'm a teen and I littarly HATE boys. Like once I went to my sister's school to see her and these Kindergarderners where skiping with Bratz dolls in there hands talking to each other like this ""Branden is sooooo sexy! Has he asked you out yet?!"" And if you buy this movie your child would be saying stuff just like that.
  Also how they treat each other is bad as well. When you have an enemy you are supose to try to be nice to them even though they hate you. In this movie they try to hate there enemys as much as possible.
  One thing for shure that I hate the most in this moive is the Twibles. Every time they make a joke they jump up in the air and smack their fat butt checks together. When I saw the scenes when they did that( which was like every one) I felt like barfing. How lesbian.
  After your daughter watches this show she will want to dress goth, listen to punk and she will start acting all prissy. Like before my sister watched this movie she was a tom-boy she loved sports and hunting and horse riding after my sister watch this movie POW! She changed into a Valley Girl wannabe. Like she was all prissy, she started to freak out about boys and make up, started dressing up in black tight cloths she was never her self agian.
  So over all Bratz send out the wrong message to children. If you want a regular child drop Bratz and get on with life.
  Kid friendly titles you should buy for a girl (5-11)

2319360,5,B0009U5FPG,Why would anyone want to put kids down for something they enjoy Let them be kids after all We all have been and those are memories not just bratz but in each thing they do  it will become a part of the childhood memories Let us Thank god that they aren't doing drugs and that they are here to play and listen to their songs and watch their movies. I am as a parent am thankful that my 11 year old daughter is here and i can watch her enjoy the unharmful things she is doing. So quit complaing and being negative is not gonna make them give up what they obviously enjoy Belinda Gibson,1133740800,7,583,4.069565217391304
2319361,1,B0009U5FPG,"every time somebody writes a bad review you girls always reply ""well your stupid,bratz rule!"" and then point out spelling errors.

here's a little tip: GET A LIFE!!!!

if you're just going to stand here defending aginst negetive bratz reviews and talk about what dolls you have (OMG!!! I have Jade!!!!!) then this is proof of what my review said.

I said: ""God,I'd rather listen to an album of those crickets chirping in my lizard's cage than listen to THIS crap,please don't support Bratz,or you will regret it sooner of later... ""

and then some girl comes to defend Bratz comes in and says: ""We, will never support you or listen to you. I love Bratz dolls for 4 years now, nothing happened, and I am fine.""

yeah, you're fine alright....your crazy and obsessed for Bratz,and you wait for more negative reviews to come in so you can go aginst them.

So in the end: you're all obsessed, for Bratz. But seeing how the toy selection for girls is so slim (dolls, dolls ,and more dolls) I can't critizise you for liking them,but you need to go out more,there's more to life than Bratz, and in 3 years you'll outgrow them...so why not outgrow them early?",1133395200,3,1150,4.558252427184466
2319362,4,B0009U5FPG,"i rented this movie for my daughters ages 7 and 5. They absolutely loved it. To tell you the truth, I found myself bopping my head along with some of the songs that the Angelz sing. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is how often the characters are referred to as ""loser"".  Now my 5 year old daughter is running around saying this to everyone. Great. Time for debriefing. Overall though, it's a good movie and it will wind up in their movie collection.",1133049600,18,468,4.318181818181818
2319363,4,B0009U5FPG,"My concern with the Bratz DVD originally stemmed from my concern with the whole brand in general. I'm thinking, if these dolls dress this way, how are they going to behave in a cartoon? I feared the brashness and promiscuity of the MTV mindset was filering down to the younger ones with a product like this.

Well, I can say I'm definitely relieved. Despite boots and miniskirts, the characters behave as very innocent, normal, and even - gasp - wholesome teens. Schoolwork is important, they emphasize putting friends before boys, the male characters are involved in a VERY plutonic fashion - despite the occasional ""date"" or ""crush"". Overall, the DVD may not contain a ton of substance but it's cute, simple, and harmless. And while the jokes are definitely for the kids, I admit to chuckling a couple times.",1128556800,11,810,4.827338129496403
2319364,5,B0009U5FPG,"Send your Barbie videos to Grandma, 'cuz the BRATZ rule DVD for today's generation!  These passion-for-fashion gurlz on on the cutting-edge of hip and cool, always leading the way (instead of desperately scrambling to follow trends like ""My Scene"" and ""Barbie"").  Rock Angelz is a huge step-forward in animation quality (from the prior ""Starrin' & Stylin"" which looked pretty lame by today's animation standards).  Word is that the NEW BRATZ video is LIGHT YEARS ahead of even ""ROCK ANGELZ,"" and that ""Livin It Up With The Bratz"" will be available on DVD Feb. 14, 2006.  Watch out Barbie... time to go to the Malibu Retirement Home!!",1127433600,4,633,4.943396226415095

2319370,5,B0009U5FPG,"This deservs all my 5 stars!! I cannot believe it! I was so excited to watch this DVD and I finally got it ^__^ It's AMAZING! LOL the animation and everything. This is even better than the first movie! And I liked the first movie too! The story goes: Jade(Soleil Moon Frye, also the voice of Zoey from the Proud Family) gets a job as a student intern for the ""evil"" Burdine Maxwell's (Wendie Mailck) ""Your Thing"" magazine but soon gets fired because of a certain pair of Tweevils. So the Bratz decide to start their OWN Bratz magazine. First assignment: hop on the next plane to London to a hot concert! There are some lessons to be learned, such as, friendship comes first... ALWAYS. Cloe(Olivia Hack?) thinks she's met her ""prince charming"" -Well Duke Charming. His name is Nigel Forrester 9th duke of Lessex- and starts to ignore her BFF's. Especially Yasmin(Lacey Chabert??- voice of Kimi from Rugrats i see?) Also Jade and Sasha(Tia Mowry from Sister Sister) get into a little argument because Sasha is being the biggest control freak. This movie rocked!! The special features are: the music video for ""So Good"" from the Rock Angelz album (I DEFINATELY recommend it!). The video is cool, it features the Rock Angelz. there is also a bonus episode ""Crush in a Rush"", it's about 22 mins. Eitan seeks advice from Dylan on how to get his crush to notice him. And the rest are advertisements for some Bratz products. This movie is fun for all, and very funny. The dolls featured are the Rock Angelz of course, Pretty in Punk, Bratz Treasures, that Space Angels(??) one. heh and i think there are more. I definately recommend this!! ages 8 up i guess

* Please, I don't want to see any bad reviews from people who haven't even seen the DVD but just want to put Bratz down*",1126656000,3,1771,4.569182389937107

Myscene isen't original, they have to put a celeb in their movie to make some money. They don't have their own ideas. Bratz Rock Angelz looks more fun. Whereas myscene looks like alot of drama about some boys, like always. So what do they do thru the whole movie? Ask where Madison is? I like Disney movies but not myscene disney movies. Bratz Rock Angelz looks better and is more cool! Neither doll is ugly, but Mattel copied the Bratz, so basically Mattel really likes how the Bratz look otherwise they wouldn't have made the myscene look like Bratz.

The word on the street with my circle of friends with daughters in the 8-12 age group is that it's definitely the more wholesome, age-appropriate movie choice this fall.  After hearing that, and after seeing Bratz's incredibly disappointing excuse for a last movie with my daughter, I can tell you where I plan to spend my money - especially after seeing this (and my past disappointments with the quality of Bratz's products and their toys' inappopriateness).",1121385600,2,751,4.859375
