6590680,4,B00MO21XHG,"After seeing the preview and read some reviews I was excited to get it and watch this set. Giddy I got home and started watching. I love reliving the attitude era and will never get tired of seeing things from it. I did have a couple problems with the set

Not enough interviews from superstars from the era. Im saying there could have been a few more

They faded out the footage out too early

All that aside if you love the attitude era get this and enjoy reliving some fun and cool moments amd matches",1419292800,,504,4.229166666666667

6590682,4,B00MO21XHG,"I do hope the WWE continues to produce volumes of the Attitude Era. I wish they would start more in 1997 and possibly late 1996, as these years really built the next 2.",1417996800,,168,4.121212121212121

6590684,3,B00MO21XHG,"This isn't a bad video at all. Much like the extras discs on the first volume it's just moments and matches. Very little ppv matches, mostly raw matches. The video is a nice addition and brings good Raw Moments that some people may have forgotten. It's just under 6 hours. It isn't wrestling heavy and the 30 matches are not much to talk about. But the moments are just as awesome, shocking, violent, comedic, sexy, and everything in between. It delivers in that area. I'd say it's more of a good companion piece to the first Attitude Era DVD.",1415232000,4,543,4.494949494949495
6590685,4,B00MO21XHG,"There isn't anything about this era of wrestling that hasn't already been said by wrestling talent & journalist & fans but one thing is clear in that this was the most popular era of sports entertainment to the point still to this day as a DVD set on this released a short time ago sold enough to warrant a second collection here in Volume 2 of ""The Attitude Era.""  This set was is different than the previous one in that it's an anthology featuring matches & moments with various superstars talking about certain elements of that era such as Sunny talking about her sex appeal including her famous outfits & managing the Road Warriors, what happened when a fan disrespected Billy Gunn around his kids, the origins of Jerry Lawler's catchphrase ""PUPPIES!"", Sean Waltman on his ""character"" X-Pac, who came up with the idea of The Godfather along with a funny story of what happened when he played a certain cassette tape in the car with Yokozuna, Edge discussing the research he put into becoming his character in The Brood along with a funny story behind the bloodbaths, The Rock telling a story about Triple H, Ron Simmons on a real life bar fight the A.P.A. got into & what happened when they tried to give a ride to a certain diva, Mark Henry discussing his ""Sexual Chocolate"" character plus who had to remove from the room when him & Mae Young filmed a segment, what Chris Jericho didn't like about his WWE debut, and what WWE Hall Of Famer kept getting put into certain situations because he had a weak stomach.

Matches Include:
WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Owen Hart - This was Owen Hart's first official match since Survivor Series looking for revenge for his family after the ""Montreal Screwjob"" as Owen started the match with with a bang attacking Shawn during his entrance & didn't let up one bit beating up on Shawn all around ringside including dropping him on the steel ramp more than once along with just beating on him repeatably to the point where Shawn couldn't get one offensive move in until a distraction gave him an advantage heavily focusing on his head including a sleeper that he had a tight grip on as they went back & forth taking advantage of any mistake they made in what was a back & forth match between both men but definitely more memorable for being Shawn's last match on RAW until his almost exactly 5 years later.
""RAW"" Dec. 97
[D-Generation X]

Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Cactus Jack & Chainsaw Charlie - What the Outlaws were wearing when they came out to the ring showed you that they were expecting a war against their opponents which is exactly what they got from the start as all four men started brawling in the ring & on the ramp as the Outlaws tried to keep this a wrestling match isolating one man working him over before Cactus & Funk made their intentions clear using whatever they could to punish the Outlaws & whoever else they got in their way.
""RAW"" Jan. 98

Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock - Both men were very cautious feeling each other out early before Shamrock was able to nail one big blow that sent The Rock out of the ring into the middle of the isleway as they traded momentum with Rock keeping Shamrock down with kicks & punches while working over his head & neck area before Shamrock was able to comeback with a diversity of power moves along with offense such as a frankensteiner in a good back & forth match between both men.
Royal Rumble 98

Owen Hart & Legion of Doom vs. Triple H & New Age Outlaws - This was a preview of the upcoming Unforgiven PPV in what was a basic tag match with Owen & L.O.D. taking control in the first half of the match causing DX to resort to tactics such as double & triple teaming behind the referee's back along with X-Pac & Chyna making their presence known on the outside.
""RAW"" Apr. 98

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Mankind vs. ""Kane"" - This was originally set to be a triple threat match also involving Undertaker to determine the #1 contender for the WWE Championship only for Mr. McMahon to add these special stipulations to this match to Mankind's disapproval due to Undertaker no showing the match...or did he?
""RAW"" July 98

Bikini Contest: Sable vs. Jacqueline - This was the infamous bikini contest that not only saw Jacqueline have a ""wardrobe malfunction"" (which was edited) but also saw Sable reveal the most envious set of hands in the history of sports entertainment.
In Your House: Fully Loaded 98

Val Venis & Taka Michinoku vs. Kaientai - Taka had his issues with Kaientai for months while Val Venis was sleeping with Kaientai's manger Mr. Yamaguchi-San's wife including making one of his famous films with her setting up this handicap tag match that eventually showed that ""blood is thicker than water"" before attempting to fulfill the threat of ""choppy choppy pee pee.""
""RAW"" Aug. 98

WWE Champion Steve Austin vs. Ken Shamrock - This started off at a very fast pace to the point where Austin wasn't able to take his shirt off until minutes into the match as Shamrock kept trying to ground Austin executing a large amount of suplexes only for Austin to try to beat him at his own game with suplexes of his own along with keeping Shamrock grounded himself throughout the match as they traded momentum with the match spilling to the outside in a good solid match.
""RAW"" Sept. 98

Boot Camp Match: Al Snow vs. Sgt. Slaughter - Al Snow would receive a WWE contract if he won as this was pretty much a come dressed as you are street fight with both men using various weapons such as a belt & steel chair along with some ""Head"" in which was a pretty basic match that served it's purpose.
""RAW"" Sept. 98

Elimination Match: Edge vs. Gangrel vs. D'Lo Brown vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Droz vs. Marc Mero - This was to determine the #1 contender for the European Championship in a match that didn't last longer than 5 minutes but was non-stop action in that time with the big issue being between Edge & Gangrel along with another mysterious man from Edge's past.
""RAW"" Sept. 98

WWE Champion The Rock vs. X-Pac - Shawn Michaels was named the new Commissioner earlier in the night & made this match but also made sure it was one on one saying at ringside as both men went back & forth early as Pac was relying on his speed along with various kicks while Rock tried to neutralize him by keeping him grounded in what was an evenly matched contest before one man decided to showcase what his true intentions were.
""RAW"" Nov. 98
[Best Of RAW: Vol. 1 & 2]

Godfather & Val Venis vs. Mark Henry & D'Lo Brown - Godfather & Val Venis came out with the Ho Train while Mark & D'Lo came out with Terri & Jacqueline as both teams went back & forth with Mark  & D'Lo playing to their individual strengths while Godfather & Venis were showing good teamwork for being a new team as it came down to both those in & outside of the ring getting a taste of P.M.S.
In Your House: Rock Bottom 98

Triple H vs. Edge - This was their first ever meeting in a very fast paced back & forth match with Edge being able to catch him in some high impact moves while Triple H relied on his punches & trademark offense like the high knee as both men were able to counter each other's offense as well in a match that lasted less than 5 minutes but more about the aftermath in regards to who got the bloodbath.
""RAW"" Jan. 99

Steve Austin vs. Kane - Mr. McMahon placed the stipulation that Kane must defeat Austin or else him & Chyna would be fired from The Corporation along with being sent back to the insane asylum.  Both men went back & forth early with a fast pace before Austin was able to focus on one part of Kane's body while Kane relied on his power eventually finding an area to attack on Austin with the action spilling over to the outside including the front row of the crowd with Chyna doing whatever he could to save her job with another man making his presence known at ringside.
""RAW"" Mar. 99

Hardcore Champion Hardcore Holly vs. Billy Gunn - Jim Ross had been battling his first case of bells palsy & was replaced by Michael Cole for months only to be denied his spot back at commentary causing him to have his own announce table setup at ringside during this match as both Holly & Gunn had your typical hardcore match trading shots at each other throughout the match using weapons in & outside of the ring such as trash cans & a broom stick & a chair but the match itself was more of a backdrop to J.R.'s ""pirate radio"" commentary.
""RAW"" Mar. 99

Big Show vs. Triple H & The Rock - The Rock came out with Austin's ""Smoking Skull"" title while also trying to use his catchphrase only for the crowd to ""play sing-a-long"" with The Rock before the match as Show was dominate here against each man individually as each man's offense had little to no effect on him while Show was able keep taking them down with strong headbutts to the point where it took illegal tactics in order to start taking the Big Show down but the bigger issue here was what happened when Shane didn't take a threat by Austin seriously & it ended up costing him...literally.
""RAW"" Apr. 99

Intercontinental Champion Goldust vs. Godfather - Goldust's original opponent was scheduled to be Big Boss Man only for him to take an offer than no man could resist allowing Godfather to replace him with the match being very one sided & dominate until one man was able to take advantage of a plan backfiring on his opponent.
""RAW"" Apr. 99

Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - Both teams traded momentum throughout the match with the Hardys relying on teamwork including getting more aggressive & resorting to tactics similar to The Brood behind the referee while Edge & Christian would work over each member individually & taking advantage of the daredevil nature of the Hardys while using whatever advantages they could with Gangrel on the outside.  Of course both teams would go on to have more high profile & classic matches with each other but this was significant for it being their first ever encounter against each other.
""Shotgun Saturday Night"" Apr. 99

Casket Match: The Rock vs. Undertaker - Rock came into this match with a cast on his wrist as both men were exchanging punches against each other before associates in the Corporate Ministry made their presence know causing Rock to attempt to even the odds using his cast as a weapon only for another weapon to be used as well in a match that was very short but more about the aftermath of what happened after someone was locked inside the casket.
""RAW"" May 99

Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Test - This was a very short contest (less than 5 minutes) that showcased Test's power offense along with Jarrett being the ring veteran being able to take advantage of an opening to take control but this match was more about just how strong Debra's influence could be.
""Sunday Night Heat"" June 99

Tag Team Champions Acolytes vs. Kane & X-Pac - This was the rebirth of the team of X-Pac & Kane complete with a new mix of entrance music as this started out in a four way brawl both in & outside of the ring with the Acolytes attempted to single out Pac using their superior power to isolate his speed while Kane was able to match power against both men in a solid match that was more significant for what Kane had to say afterwords.
""RAW"" Aug. 99

No Disqualification Match: European Champion Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho vs. Tazz - This was a real quick match (under 5 minutes) that saw each man attempt to only focus on one individual to win only for the third man to keep getting involved with allies of the participants getting involved as well.
""RAW"" Mar. 00

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. Kurt Angle - Both men traded momentum throughout the match with Jericho being able to keep using Angle's own momentum against him while Angle was able to relying on his heavy amount of various suplexes including a superplex off the top rope as both men continued to counter & reverse each others offense as it just came down to one man being able to catch the other.
""RAW"" May 00

Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko - Eddie had his mamacita Chyna in his corner while Malenko had some ladies of his own in his corner as this was pretty much a short encounter that went back & forth with impactful power moves like the powerbomb & gutbuster but it came down to one move accidentally hitting the wrong person.
""Sunday Night Heat"" June 00

The Rock & Lita vs. Kurt Angle & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley - This started out with all four brawling with the men dominating the in-ring action with women occasionally getting in on the action but it was what happened to Stephanie that caused her husband Triple H to first come to her rescue & then get physically involved in the match but the bigger picture here was who was not only who was there for Stephanie at the end of the night but her reaction to what he did.
""SmackDown"" Aug. 00

Womens Champion Lita vs. Ivory vs. Jacqueline - This started out with one woman being the odd girl out only for it to quickly become every woman for herself with one woman using the strategy of divide & conquer to win what was a very short encounter but solid for what it was.
""Sunday Night Heat"" Sept. 00

Hardcore Champion Gerald Brisco vs. Crash Holly - This was your typical hardcore match during that time that saw some weapons used from a fire extinguisher to stop sign along with other things including items like a pair of dirty underwear as this match was pretty much the sillyness that the division revolved around at that time.
""RAW"" June 00

Hardcore Championship/Evening Gown Match: Pat Patterson vs. Gerald Brisco - Both men came out dressed in drag with one man clearly being more comfortable in it than the other to the point where Howard Finkel got an unwanted gift at ringside in a match that was suppose to be comedic but just came off bad from the in-ring action such as a maxi-pad to the face that the crowd turned on right away to the purposely bad commentary until another man mercifully put this match out of it's misery as the behind the scenes story of how this match came together (told my Michael Hayes on one of the Legends Of Wrestling roundtables with Pat Patterson) was funnier than the match itself.
King Of The Ring 00

The Rock & Lita vs. Triple H & Trish Stratus - Triple H was trying to keep his distance from Trish based off the misunderstanding that happened involving them & Stephanie days earlier on SmackDown as Rock & HHH along with Trish & Lita went against each other early on as the females had no issues getting physically involved against their male opponents to help out their partners while the men did the same thing weather it was behind the referees or using their partners against each other in what was a fun match with the final image of how one team was left laying definitely made every female Triple H or male Trish Stratus fan want to trade places with them.
""RAW"" July 00

(Blu-Ray) Golga vs. Marc Mero - Sable came to the ring before the match to introduce the new Oddities complete with Kurrgan & Giant Silva dressed in tuxedos while Luna had a makeover looking like a Princess & Golga showcasing his favorite cartoon in what was a short match with Sable once again getting one-up on Mero & Jacqueline.
""RAW"" Aug. '98

(Blu-Ray) Kane & Mankind vs. Owen Hart & The Rock - This was a #1 contenders match with the winning team getting a tag team title shot the next night on RAW as both teams were evenly matched as each team had the same strategy focusing on cutting the ring off making quick tags isolating who they felt was the weaker member of their opponents with double teaming as each team played to their strengths along with members of each team going aerial at one point in a solid tag team match that's more memorable for being the first main event on ""Sunday Night Heat.""
""Sunday Night Heat"" Aug. 98

(Blu-Ray) Hardcore Champion Road Dogg vs. Al Snow - Al Snow was still covered in blood from the bloodbath The Brood gave him days earlier while ""Head"" was blindfolded with it's hair shaved as Snow attacked Road Dogg on the ramp with Dogg being able to regain control in the ring thanks to a launched chair as both men continued to use the chair along with a table & cookie sheet at ringside with the brawl being taken to different areas of the backstage area from the janitorial area to the garage with potted plants being thrown & bodies being thrown through beer kegs eventually making it's way outside in the snow with more weapons being used before it took one man's head being driven through wooden crates in what has gone down as one of the best matches in the history of the Hardcore Championship.
""RAW"" Jan. 99

(Blu-Ray) Lumberjack Match: Steve Austin vs. The Rock - The Corporate Ministry were the lumberjacks at ringside in what was advertised to be a match but ended up being nothing more than a setup as Austin & Rock were fighting off the lumberjacks before they even had the chance to touch each other causing the locker room to empty in an all out brawl resulting in four men left on the stage fighting each other but only two left standing.
""RAW"" May 99

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Triple H vs. Mr. McMahon - Triple H requested Shane McMahon to be the special referee before he challenged Vince who accepted as a series of verbal attacks against him & his wife with Triple H constantly pounding & stomping keeping Vince down before getting more violent using whatever weapons he could at ringside to the point where he eventually turned his attention to EVERY McMahon & associate of theirs in sight along as Chyna got involved as well with one man getting involved causing what was at the time the unthinkable to happen.
""SmackDown"" Sept. 99

(Blu-Ray) Last Man Standing Match: Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Both men brawled right away & took the fight to the outside before Triple H focused on Jericho's injured ribs, from a previous attack by Triple H & DX, using the tape to choke him & working that area with various holds such as a suplex on the outside, abdominal stretch, sleeper hold with a body scissors, countering an attempt at a Lionsault with his knees into those ribs, using a chair, and Stephanie getting a shot in on the outside. Triple H kept beating on Jericho & punching him until Jericho dared him to give him more before Jericho started to play dirty himself going low on Triple H & nailing a chairshot that busted Triple H open before delivering a bulldog onto that same chair but Triple H kept fighting back using the steel steps on Jericho's ribs before both men ended up having the same idea when it came to the TV monitors & later when it came to the spanish table with Stephanie getting a receipt for her interference as well. While Triple H & Jericho have had a heavy amount of matches throughout their careers, this was definitely in the top 3 as one of their best encounters with Jericho showing the aggression that we don't really see out of him often.

[Triple H: That Damn Good]

Other moments include the 1997 Miss Slammy swimsuit competition, Steve Austin & Mr. McMahon's (complete with his WBF sweats LOL) first ""match"", DX takes over New York, Mark Henry's sex addiction therapy sessions, and Mark Henry & Mae Young celebrate Valentine's Day.  Blu-Ray extras also include Undertaker attending his parents funeral, Mark Henry & Mae Young's double date, the birth of the Acolytes Protection Agency, and Gangrel & Christian vs. Droz & Prince Albert (""Heat"" May 99).

This collection is a mixed bag as we did get some good quality matches & moments but also some that were here for either historical significance or the top names involved but wasn't much as far as memorable quality while I still feel some matches & moments were again forgotten about (like the Rock/HHH ""I Quit"" match, Austin/Rikishi's Steel Cage match, either the tag team title match or main event from the SmackDown pilot special, Triple H's Inferno Match vs. Kane or Brahma Bullrope Match vs. Rock or his title match vs. British Bulldog with The Rock as the referee from SmackDown in Sept. 99, Lita vs. Stephanie McMahon for the Womens Championship with The Rock as the referee comes to mind right away).  In the end, it's still a collection for fans of this era that I would recommend.",1414540800,5,20269,4.508442265795207

Overall: Yet another amazing set on the Attitude Era that looks to be just as good as the first! I really wish that they took some time to focus on the early parts of the Attitude Era though with people like Sycho Sid, Bret Hart, and more DX but it'll be a great set nonetheless. One thing I really like about this second volume of the Attitude Era is that it focuses more on a lot of the mid-carders and divas who contributed to the Attitude Era; whereas the first volume tended to put the light more on The Rock, Stone Cold, Triple H, and The Undertaker. This set focuses more on Sable, Kane, X-Pac, Val Venis, Owen Hart, Billy Gunn, Hardcore Holly, Mark Henry, Lita, and others. I also wish they had included some moments and matches from 2001 in here as well. Although 2001 was a short year for the Attitude Era, there was still tons of awesome moments and matches that could've been included in the set. If you're a fan who grew up in the Attitude Era like I did and want to relive some of the greatest days from WWF TV, buy this set!",1410825600,47,4898,4.47678369195923

6590695,3,B00MO21XHG,"First of all if you can find this set for cheap and I mean cheap,like at Walmart for 5 bucks definitely pick it up. it's not really worth throwing down 20 bucks on imo.

I picked up the DVD set at Walmart for said price and I guess it was an OK purchase. What sucks right off the bat is that for such a revered time in company history there are ZERO special features on the DVD set.

sure it focuses on a lot of the mid Card acts from both Raw and Later Smackdown, but I think it's pretty cool. I personally would have loved more godfather and his entrances and celebrations with the ho's, but that's just me. You get Sunny on the first disc talking about how she was the first girl to wear a thong on WWF/E tv back in the day, Mark Henry discussing sexual chocolate and working with Mae young,Ron Simmons talking about how him and Bradshaw would get into all kinds of bar fights during the APA run and Gerald Brisco talking about his weak stomach and how he would throw up constantly during gross segments.... just to name a few of the quick little talking heads that are inter spread throughout the DVD feature.

like I say if you can find it for cheap pick it up. it's just kind of okay and I would have to rate it a 3 out of 5. it feels like there's a lot missing that they could have included but didn't.",1427760000,,1309,4.10546875
6590696,4,B00MO21XHG,"Good to great matches and segments.  Even at 6 disks now, hard to cover all that was the Attitude Era.  So much more could be presented here, most of it is from Raw rather than PPVs.  There more variety with guys like Val Venis, Mark Henry and The Godfather getting their due.",1427155200,,276,4.269230769230769

6590698,3,B00MO21XHG,"I was really looking forward to this release. The included matches...? So so. Sure it's a bit of a step up in the included matches vs the 1st release. But not by that much. I was hoping to get lots more good/great matchs of the era, but (IMHO) the included matches weren't that good. About 6 hrs of Attitude Era matches, yet it felt like I was watching a long highlight reel. They added lots of matches, but most of them are real short matches. No PPV matches, a few SmackDown matches & of course no extra contain. I don't get why WWE doesn't give extra contain with the DVD versions. Plus the video quality on some matches were a bit pixelated.",1425772800,,645,4.295081967213115

6590701,5,B00MO21XHG,"Another great collection of the attitude era. The first volume was more about the top stars of that era. This volume (vol. 2) focused more on the midcard and lowercard guys of that era. Which in my personal opinion were ALL stars. Frankly to me during that era there was not really low,mid,top stars. they all were top stars. To be honest during the attitude era you wanted to see ALL wrestlers, all wrestlers had interesting stories and all were exacting to watch. This is a must have for any fan of the attitude era. and the perfect follow-up to volume 1.
I hope there is a volume 3 in the future, still a lot of things to cover from that era: Like the Corporation, the Ministry of darkness, the women of the attitude era. APA, McMahon-Hamsley era.",1420675200,,750,4.442028985507246
