7857823,5,6303981224,"I no longer own this VHS, but I had it years ago and I lost 37 lbs using this as my only workout method, along with a healthy diet. I truly wish I could find this workout on DVD b/c I would absolutely purchase it again.
I enjoyed the simple movements and easy pace. For someone who needs a more basic workout to just get you moving, this is a great program. If you're more advanced and would like something more challenging, this may not be the one for you, although there are modifications you can make to the moves to increase your exertion.
There are parts that are maybe a little cheesy, and it's certainly highly outdated, but all in all, it's easy to stick with and can help you succeed if longevity is what you're after.

Enjoy! :-)",1396224000,,739,4.2785714285714285
7857824,4,6303981224,"I've never done an aerobics video before so this is my first experience. I can't dance, and I'm not very coordinated, but I personally have really enjoyed this video. I'm doing the Jenny Craig program right now, so Jenny's motivational speeches don't bother me. It just gives me a few seconds to cool down. Also, I think the instructor is a great blend of upbeat and informative. Although I have nothing to compare it to, I think her cues are right on. She usually gives you enough time to figure out what you're doing before she puts all the moves together in a sequence. She is motivating and reminds you that everyone on the set is losing weight, too. There is no one there with a perfect body and you don't feel like they aren't in your shoes. In fact, they even have one person on the set moving at a lower intensity to show you options that you can use while you're still learning the routines.

There is also an added toning section to use weights, or just use your body weight as resistance. Then there is an abs section that really isn't bad. I hate crunches, and these are great variations on the generic crunches. And lastly, there is a bonus yoga section that allows you to enjoy a good, relaxing stretch work-out.

I would definitely recommend this video to a first-timer like myself! I don't enjoy exercise, but I actually look forward to doing this video. I've lost 10 lbs with no additional activity.",1100822400,,1416,4.505836575875486
7857825,4,6303981224,"I found this tape at Goodwill for $1.00, but I would've paid more for it.
This is an easy workout with easy moves similar to that of walk-aerobics. I don't know what the other reviewer talking about with regards to difficult/awkward moves? The instructor is excellent in providing enough time to learn each move before going on.
This tape has 4 aerobic segments including a brief warm-up and cool down. The instructor breaks down each segment into little pieces and then strings them together to form the routine for that segment. She utilizes some good ol' standby's like side-steps, walk forward/back, kickbacks, grapevines, v-steps, and then throws in some of her own moves too.
This is a great tape for people who enjoy low-impact or walk aerobics. I believe it would be considered a beginners tape, although by increasing the movements it has potential to raise heartrates for more experienced exercisers.
One thing I enjoyed about this tape was the music. It wasn't too cheezy and the instructor is perky without being annoying. The sound and video quality of the tape is good too.
One thing I hated about this tape was the interruptions made during the workout by Jenny Craig herself. Her advice is sound and good - but it's easy to lose your step when they pull back from the instructor to focus on her.",1080864000,3,1311,4.779735682819383
