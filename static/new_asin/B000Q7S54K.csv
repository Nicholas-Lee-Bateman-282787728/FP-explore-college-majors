2833219,5,B000Q7S54K,"This is one Jerry Lewis movie that is certainly hard to find today. It follows him as a visitor from outer space adopting to human behavior in 1960. The person that wrote this script was none other than well respected author,Gore Vidal.  It does have its funny moments which is typical Jerry Lewis. Okay entertainment nevertheless!",1180137600,16,331,4.910714285714286
2833220,4,B000Q7S54K,"This is not one of his better films (he neither wrote, produced or directed; maybe telling in itself). However, there are some very funny bits. First is the bourbon drinking sequence (including clever special effects). Then there's the beatnik club. The patrons' attire, their language, the music and his dance sequence were really good. The underlying theme is him as a visitor from outer space. He understands nothing about love, in the innocence of teenage attraction. Though not his best, it was still fun to watch.

This film was a slap stick comedy on UFOs! Anyone who watched this movie laughed and was amused! No Academy Awards but a good time at the movies! It was at the time of SciFi, fighting Communism, and Senator Joe McCarthy saying that Hollywood was full of communist! This film made Americans laugh at our selves in what we all believed in with of the world's problems at hand! It served its purpose for the moment!
With today's issues I believe that Americans should have a laugh especially at ourselves!!! Everyone is too serious on LIFE!! Watch a movie and laugh!! Laughter doesn't cost anything!!",1514419200,2,762,4.489208633093525

When Kreton s fascination with earthlings gets the better of him, he breaks one of his planet's laws and speeds off to visit the blue planet. Once there, Kreton encounters a nice family who kindly takes him in. The patriarch of the family is a ""there ain't no such things as aliens"" type. As a sometimes fan of Jerry Lewis I can o=honestly say that this is a favorite of mine. It was pretty funny from start to finish. Jerry did such a great job in this movie as did the rest of the cast. He divulges his identity to some of the Earthlings and tells them they can't tell anyone who he is. Love the force field bits. In this instance the Jerry wackiness works on all fronts.

2833246,3,B000Q7S54K,I'm 60 y.o. and have seen this several times. It's not a great movie but it's a clean movie with no potty mouthing or bump & grind filthy sex in it like most of the garbage coming out of Sodom & Gomorrah Hollywood today.  There is one moment were Jerry being from another planet wants to see the mating act of humans but there is no nudity in it. Might not want very young kids to hear that. Older teens already are well aware of how sex done so it may be okay for them. You are the parent you be the judge. For the most part it's a clean movie. I doubt young people will care too much for this film.,1496880000,,600,3.918032786885246

I was surprised, as there was a little minor zanious, but not to the annoying level.  As I researched the movie I found that this one was the last made under the studio system, before Jerry Lewis formed his own production company.
This to me is a perfect example of having good oversight, since this seems to be one of his best movies.
The special effects are good for a movie of its vintage.  Had it been made in color (which was available at that time) I would have given 5 stars.",1472774400,,691,4.180451127819549

Lewis's slapstick style did not seem to get in the way here, the way it normally does for me.  Perhaps that is due to the need to suspend disbelief when watching sci-fi; Lewis's methods are out-of-place with any movie needing realism.

That said, the special effects and science concepts must have been well ahead of their time when you consider that this movie came out in 1960.

Though, now, the science is a bit out of date -- for instance we now know the universe to be 13.7 billion lightyears across instead of only 8 million as stated in the film. But then, it's a mistake to get hung up on those details with a film like this. The point of it is that it's a bit of slapstick comedy with social commentary and satire. I highly recommend this film.",1446249600,2,604,4.260869565217392

It was one of the most memorable, most entertaining and funniest movies I have ever seen. Of course I was a kid when I first saw it but I still think it is one of the best comedies ever made. The only Jerry Lewis movie I might like more is ""The Nutty Professor"". Most Jerry Lewis movies are so weak on story that they seem to be little more than excuses for Jerry doing a series of goof-ball skits. But the story in this movie is very solid and it overshaddows most of his more recent movies that were made in color. Too bad ""A Visit to a Small Planet"" was made in Black & White.

2833420,2,B000Q7S54K,"VISIT TO A SMALL PLANET was a hit for Gore Vidal in the late 1950s, a satire on Cold War obsessions through the device of having an alien visiting the Earth from another planet.  In Norman Taurog's version the story has been coarsened into a vehicle for Jerry Lewis, who turns in a performance that can most charitably be described as irritating.  The basic framework of the play remains; but the political satire has been removed.  Now all we are left with are some fairly predictable points about sexual repression and fake morality in a Puritan world.  The lovers (Joan Blackman, Earl Holliman) elope in order to continue their love-affair, but (true to the spirit of the times) they have to get married at the same time. 'Living in sin,' is frowned upon.  Such constraints, both sexual and social, are precisely the kind of material Vidal so objected to in societies throughout his life.  John Williams turns up in the film as Kreton's - in in other words, cretin's - (Lewis's) control, living in outer space; he turns in a passable imitation of George Sanders.  However the film outstays its welcome, despite being only 80 minutes long.",1365033600,4,1141,4.761421319796955

It wasn't as near as funny as I remembered it, but did still held its own as for as cheesy comedy goes. Jerry as an alien infatuated with earth was a great concept, but they could have done so much more with it. Jerry is dumb and smart at the same time and even though he keeps telling everyone he meets not to tell anyone who he is, he keeps telling everyone he meets what he is and where he's from. It's a fun film to watch but don't try and make any since of it. Just set back and enjoy the silliness.

Conrad is a sex starved goat loving goof.
Ellen is just weird, wanting to be slapped around have babies and be forced to plow the fields.

2833428,2,B000Q7S54K,"This is a slightly amusing comedy about a naive (idiot?) spaceman coming to Earth, trying to go native. Since the film came out, in 1960, the basic plot has since been hashed and rehashed and re-rehashed by Hollywood, so whatever novelty it once may have had has evaporated. The best part is when the couple go to a beatnik bar (beatnik being the precursors of hippies, daddy-o); that brought back memories.",1310947200,3,407,4.746478873239437
2833429,5,B000Q7S54K,"Jerry Lewis is one of America's greatest comedians, even though they probably don't realize it. The fact that this little gem was so hard to find and is not included in the more mainstream collections of Jerry Lewis' films makes me wonder if there's a conspiracy to censor the more  unconventional works of American artists. In this one, Jerry plays an alien who has a 'thing' about Earth. He has powers that are exploited brilliantly for comedic effect: the scene in the Beatniks' night club is hysterically funny as Lewis sends up the 'Beat' generation's penchant for mistaking gibberish for profundity. Jerry's alien cries buckets as a slim beatnik girl sings a song that is all 'scat' but Jerry interprets as a tragic love song. There is a lot of familiar Lewis slapstick but the twist taken on everyday human activity raises this film above the usual Lewis humour and makes some pointed comments about how humans live. What started out as mere curiosity turns into genuine infatuation as Lewis' alien learns more about humankind's foibles and frailties. Whilst many a true word is said in jest, this film allows us to laugh at ourselves and come away feeling a little more optimistic about our future.",1310169600,2,1206,4.854368932038835
2833430,4,B000Q7S54K,"Gore Vidal penned the story upon which this film is based.  Originally a satire on the Cold War, the film turns this story into more of a farce, much safer fare for Hollywood that didn't want to be seen as criticizing the government during the Cold War (shades of McCarthy still roamed the Hollywood Hills).  Still, this is a reasonably good comedy for the time period.  Jerry Lewis plays his favourite character - himself - as an alien schoolboy (Lewis' stock characters were usually much younger than he himself was) infatuated with the Earth.  However, not taking into account the time lapse caused by the speed of light, the images of Earth he has been seeing are of the Civil War; his space ship manages to arrive on Earth about a hundred years later.  He drops into a home in the South, where people are dressed for a costume party (complete with a Jefferson Davis).  Lewis' character, Kreton (cretan), combines his own ignorance with the ignorance of the humans he encounters - the difference, of course, is that Kreton doesn't have a particular political angle to support among the Earthlings, and therefore can approach things a bit more objectively, albeit (since this is Lewis) in a slapstick fashion.

At first, the humans he encounter don't want to accept the reality of aliens; Kreton convinces them, but along the way some become fearful, and others become intrigued.  Character actor John Williams plays Devlin, the long-suffering teacher of Kreton, who allows his wayward pupil to try to get the 'Earth obsession' out of his system.  Earl Holliman and Joan Blackman play a couple trying to figure out their future; Gale Gordon (perhaps best known as one of the Mr. Wilsons in 'Dennis the Menace' or as Lucille Ball's boss, Mr. Mooney) plays the civil defense authority variously trying to figure out what to do and how to get proof to share of the alien.

Does the alien mean well?  Are humans in fact always happy-go-lucky, planning costume balls and falling in love?  These are things the alien explores, with some unexpected results.

Detail to note - many of the ways the spaceman manifests his powers include tugging the ear and twitching the nose, classic `Bewitched' moves, a show done about the same time.",1298851200,16,2230,4.821522309711286

2833433,2,B000Q7S54K,"Gore Vidal's Cold War satire, created as a 1957 TV play, has very little in common with this movie which bears its title. Instead it became a vehicle for Jerry Lewis to do his stock mugging, ""dancing,"" and instrument playing in a slightly different environment. As a vehicle for Jerry Lewis, it might be better than his usual ones, but it is really stuck in a time-warp. Beatniks and the Beatnik culture were already out-of-fashion by the time this movie was filmed, so watching the ""cool, daddy!"" coffeehouse scene doesn't hold up well today and fatally dates the movie. Just as ""Hair"" was outdated when it was finally filmed, ""Visit to a Small Planet"" suffers the same. Those who enjoyed the film when it first came out nearly fifty years ago would probably be surprised by their reaction to watching it now, which I have just done. Some films are ageless; this isn't one of them.",1235692800,,882,4.660256410256411

But this hybrid of Jerry and Gore Vidal doesn't really hold up today and is not a good match.
