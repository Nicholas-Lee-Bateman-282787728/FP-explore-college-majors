772251,3,6304081006,"Big return for the most frightening character ever been. While the first straight-to-video sequel was a little bit weak and pointless (but still enjoyable) this one could have been a great theatrical follow-up to SAM RAIMI's cosmic masterpiece if done with the proper production values (big budget) and more sequences.
 Of course, this one is the best ""video sequel"" and the real one by all means. You know, they filmed ""DIE, DARKMAN, DIE!"" long time before ""THE RETURN OF DURANT"", but when Larry Drake agreed to reprise his role as Robert G. Durant, the production company skipped DIE and went to film RETURN.
As far as concerning DIE, I liked the story a lot. Rooker is da man! Great villain. Arnold Vosloo was really getting in touch with Darkman, you can see it from his performance direction.
FInally, there's a fandom for Darkman at westlakedarkman.proboards3.com - Just enjoy.
I'm waiting for a DVD release of ""DARKMAN III: DIE, DARKMAN, DIE!"". Mmm... featuring deleted scenes and documentaries? Hell yes!
DARKMAN still remains the most frightening hero who ever graced the world. The ""cult"" will rise from the ashes just like Peyton Westlake did. The time has come.",1082764800,2,1173,4.98469387755102
772252,4,6304081006,"I'm a big fan of the Darkman character. The original was outstanding, with the great Liam Neeson as Darkman. DARKMAN 3 is shouldn't be compared to it, but it still has alot of action and a pretty good storyline.
Arnold Vosloo, who took the helm of Darkman in the second film(I skipped that one), is no Liam Neeson, but is absolutely enjoyable as Darkman. I'm happy to know that the filmmakers did a good job by keeping the character the same. His emotions, frustration, and alienation are well done here.
Jeff Fahey is gives an over-the-top performance as the bad guy Peter Rooker, whose evil plan is to gain powerful strength just like Darkman's. Fahey is sort of believable as a bad guy, but he overacts himself, even with a sadistic character like Rooker! But Vosloo is the savior here, who potrays a more humane Darkman in this entry. He does a good job at playing different emotions with the character.
I'm not that surprised that the film was a direct-to-video, but was a good film nonetheless. I love the Darkman character, and I'm dissapointed there isn't very much of a fan following. I just wish another Darkman film was made, or a TV series, which is a even better idea, because the Darkman films are fantastic.",1076716800,3,1222,4.635944700460829
772253,2,6304081006,"This second sequel to ""Darkman"" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about ""Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die,"" which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one. Everyone else will be in the dark.",1053129600,5,1671,4.4640522875816995
772254,5,6304081006,"I won't take too much time here, just wanted to state that Darkman 3 is awesome.  I have all 3 on DVD, added these to my collection of DVD movie sets.  Darkman ranks up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. Many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the Darkman trillogy.  By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD. I purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most US DVD players are region 1.  If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player since it is an all region player.  Just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want ( 1-9 ).  Hope this helps",1026259200,9,748,4.054421768707483
772255,3,6304081006,"Just as the two in the series prior, this is dark/brooding. The major draw for this movie like Darkman 2 is the star ""Arnold Vosloo"". The first in the series with Liam Neeson is the best, however I being a Vosloo fan have all 3 in my collection. If you are a fan you should enjoy this one. Lisa C.",1003881600,,297,3.966666666666667
772256,4,6304081006,"DArkman 3 is a very original way to follow the story of THE MOST ORIGINAL character of all the times : DARKMAN. Finally,someone explains us the real nature of the beloved Dr. Westlake (He's a mutant)and this third chapter is  best than Darkman 2... Darkman is the coolest character of the Nineties,and  we fans can be proud of this third installment...Vosloo rules !",962323200,2,366,4.7936507936507935
772257,3,6304081006,Despite the corny title this is actually a decent movie. The performances are good for being a direct to video so is the storyline. Those who liked the first may find this to their liking.,956361600,,188,4.4
772258,4,6304081006,"I enjoyed this film, probably because I didn't see Darkman before viewing it and therefore had no preconceived ideas of how it should be.  I have since seen Darkman II, which I liked less because I liked the villian less.  Mr. Fahey in Darkman III is much more versatile; he convinced me--until I  actually took time to consider it--that he was Darkman in disguise, so  different was his demeanor in those instances.  His growing insanity was  quite believable as well.  Mr. Vosloo was also quite good in his role.  His  concern for his enemy's family seemed quite genuine.",952905600,,573,4.76530612244898

772399,5,6304081006,This is a pretty good movie. like the second movie it was not as good as the first one. the reason for being the guy who plays darkman I really wished that they kept liam neeson for this one and the second one. the movie was not that bad I liked it but it would of been better if liam neeson was in it. I thought the story was good and so was the action the acting was not bad. the guy who played the villain was pretty good. but the series would of been much better if they kept liam neeson. Arnold vosloo did a decent job playing darkman. I just wish that they keep the original actors. oh well the movie was still good. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1402704000,,678,3.920289855072464
772400,5,6304081006,I wasn't sure what to expect with this third go around as the characters had changed from the original.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed it.  A most worthy successor.,1353888000,,191,4.588235294117647
772401,5,6304081006,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Before he became The Mummy, Arnold Vosloo was Darkman, a role originated by Liam Neeson six years earlier in Darkman and taken over by Vosloo for Darkman II: The Return Of Durant and this third film (which was originally going to be the first sequel to Darkman). Mr. Vosloo is a good actor, expressing everything from pain and anguish to intense anger and happiness. Jeff Fahey plays a slimy s.o.b., as usual (see Psycho III for an example), and he does it very well. The actress who plays Fahey's wife resembles Rachel McAdams. The story was well-written, and very good from the get-go. SPOILER ALERT!!! The movie is open-ended, with the possibility for a sequel. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! In the first scene where Peyton appears in his black trenchcoat behind the doctor, I thought, Mr. Vosloo would make an excellent Dracula. He's got the charm and the menace neccessary for the role. I highly recommend this movie. I'm a bit disappointed that Liam Neeson didn't return as Darkman; I wonder why. (At least, Sam Raimi produced both sequels). Will there ever be a sequel to this movie? Should have been made as a theatrical release, but for a direct-to-video sequel, it was really good. Should have been rated PG-13.",1328745600,,1261,4.784403669724771
772402,3,6304081006,"I loved the original film but never wanted to give the sequels a chance because I didn't like that the actor was replaced from the first film. Even though hes different, He's passable and the story, action & special effects are decent for a direct to video. looking forward to watching darkman 2 now.",1295481600,2,300,4.574074074074074
772403,4,6304081006,"Aw hell, since I reviewed the other two, why not part 3, eh?  Continuing in pretty much the same style as part 2, Darkman 3 gives us a new villain in the form of Jeff Fahey.  Fahey's into marketing steroids and he's a lousy husband and father.  Darkman's on hand to throw a wrench in his steroid operation.  But when Fahey captures Darkman(thus screwing him once again right when he's on the verge of perfecting his synthetic skin.  Man, this guy's always having the rug pulled out from under him at the last minute), he finds a way to make a super steroid from Darkman's blood, thus injecting his henchmen with the steroid and giving them Darkman's strength.  He plans to make big bucks with this neat new drug.  Darkman gets away and goes after Fahey, but along the way becomes infatuated with Fahey's wife and daughter who he feels sorry for since they are treated like dirt.  Darkman does what he does best by being master of disguise and sneaking around Fahey's operation.  One amusing scene has him wearing Fahey's face and searching his home for a computer disc and then finding himself in the middle of a surprise birthday party thrown for him.  Of course it all leads to the big confrontation with Fahey and his supergoons.  Typical, yet fun little action flick.  There's a little bit more of an attempt to go for Darkman's emotional side again, moreso than the last film.  Vosloo's not gonna get the academy's attention around Oscar time, but he's still suave and cool as all hell as Darkman.  Fahey makes for a rather sinister, soft spoken villain.  He's no Robert G Durant, but he's a mean SOB.  If you liked the style of the second film, then there's no reason you shouldn't find this entertaining.  Harmless family fun.",1185580800,,1733,4.611111111111111

772405,1,6304081006,"I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasn't for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didn't know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get.

Oh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing. I really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made. But that was untill I saw reptillian. Which is kinda depressingly awfull.",1119139200,3,1367,4.319066147859922
772406,3,6304081006,"Lets stop making lame sequels boys and girls.  I mean this isn't a real bad sequel, but they are getting lamer.  Why not slow it down, and turn it into a TV series.  It would be exciting and different from anything else on the boob tube.  Jeff Fahey is always welcome in any movie, but doesn't have the menacing premise that Larry Drake had.  Still, loaded with lottsa action and suspense.  Good special effects enhance the story, and lets face it, you need this one to complete the set.",1105056000,4,487,4.415730337078652

The dialog is decidedly poor, and Darlanne Fluegel is downright painful to watch or listen to. There is never a time she is even vaguely believable as a doctor both for her dialogue as well as her acting. I'm, literally, watching this movie right now on cable and doubt I will finish it.
