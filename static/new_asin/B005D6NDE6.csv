8466335,1,B005D6NDE6,"...you have a DVD player that allows you to play discs from Region 2. I didn't see any such warning about the set (nor did I look for one). Who knew there were ""regions for DVRs??! It was a set I've been wanting for years. I saw it on Prime Day at a great price and ordered it. BIG disappointment! And since I opened it, the company won't let me return it for a refund! RIP OFF",1501545600,,377,3.909090909090909
