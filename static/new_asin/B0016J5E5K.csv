3157033,5,B0016J5E5K,"Roger Corman's ""X"" The Man With The X-Ray Eyes is a great sci-fi horror film made for only $300,000.  The title might have you think it's an over the top B movie but the material is taken very seriously with a lot of help from Oscar winner Ray Milland as Dr. Xavier.
Dr. Xavier is a surgeon and scientist who is being funded to improve eyesight and creates a type of serum that enables X ray vision.  With pressure to stop funding his experiments Dr. Xavier decides to use the eye drops on himself.  This is the interesting Sci-fi angle that turns into somewhat of an adventure when Xavier accidentally kills a colleague and ends up on the run.
Becoming obsessed to see more and more Xavier continues to use the drops and uses dark glasses to cover his eyes.  He makes money working at a carnival.  At first the concept has it's perks, seeing through clothes and that sort of thing but soon Xavier can see through the skin, organs, and can see walking skeletons.  He can see the beginnings of cites.  This is where the horror concept comes in the film.  It's brilliant because it knows what you can't see, the unknown is usually the most frightening to us.  We do get glimpses of what the Dr. sees but at the end and on the run as he stumbles into a church sermon, his eyes completely black he says he sees beyond the blackness to the center of the universe and it isn't pleasant.  We the viewers can fill in our own worst imaginable fear of what lurks in the dark or in this case the unknown because the Dr. never sees the dark anymore even when he sleeps he sees through his eyelids.  Another very smart aspect is using the eye itself, it's such a sensitive part of our bodies.

3157040,4,B0016J5E5K,"Roger Corman is best known for a series of eight inexpensive yet unexpectedly effective films vaguely based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe and released in the 1960s.  All but one of these starred Vincent Price; THE PREMATURE BURIAL, the third film in the group, starred Ray Milland.  Corman and Milland worked well together, and Corman quickly cast Milland in a non-Poe film, XTHE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES.  Shot in about three weeks on a slim budget, the film became one of Cormans most widely praised works, receiving positive words from the serious critics and raking in some fairly big bucks at the box office, too.

Dr. Xavier (Milland) is experimenting with solutions that will allow the human eye to see normally invisible spectrums of light.  At first, the results are amusing: when he attends a party, he discovers he can see right through their clothes.  Later, the results seems to be potentially beneficial: he is able to correctly diagnose a childs illness and save her life.  But when he accidentally kills a co-worker (Harold J. Stone), Dr. Xavier goes on the run, sinking to performing a psychic act in a carnival and then coerced into acting as a healer by a vicious blackmailer (Don Rickles, in his first film role.)  A fellow scientist and possible love interest (Diana Van der Vlis) attempts to pull him back from the voidbut has Dr. Xavier gone too far to return?

The cast is very attractive, with Rickles giving a surprisingly nasty performance and Diana Van der Vlis, an actress most often seen on stage and television, is both charming and effective.  But most interesting are the special effects.  As Dr. Xaviers use of the drug progresses, the appearance of his eyes changeand the audience often sees things from his point of view.  This is the pre CGI world, and by todays standards the effects are technically clunky  but that doesnt prevent them from being interesting.

Some DVD releases of this film include a directors commentary by Corman, which is interesting, but if you're wondering if the rumor about a famous line that was supposedly cut from the filmwell, youll have to keep wondering.  Corman has remembered this several different ways over the years.  Whatever the case, XTHE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES is a fun film, an often interesting film, and worth watching.

3157041,4,B0016J5E5K,"Considering the budget for the movie (around $300,000) this movie turned out fairly decent. That is not to say this is  great movie - I would say more intriguing than great - but it still is enjoyable. I watched this by myself first to  make sure it was as I remembered it then I watched this with some friends at our monthly movie night. When it's warm I set up my 10 foot screen outside and watch a movie plus some cartoons, 1930-40's movie shorts, movie trailers, even some of the old drive-in intermission stuff - I try to keep it about 3 to 3.5 hours in total usually.

At first he can see through such things as clothes (always fun at a party with beautiful women). As he starts using the eye drops more they become more effective, even too effective.

Directed by Roger Corman, this movie was made around the same time as the Corman/Vincent Price movies, and like those, it's a pretty ambitious project, much superior to Corman's earlier ultra-low budget movies such as ""Creature from the Haunted Sea"", both when it comes to production values and more importantly to the quality of the script.

The message is so important that it was transferred to DVD.

Moderation in all things. What happens if you get too much of a good thing?

Dr. James Xavier finds out what it is like going beyond underwear. And into the mysteries of life. His creation of drops that let you see on a new plane can be dangerous. The more he drops the more he sees.

The visual effects are worth the movie alone. Just look what happened when he was monkeying around?

Directed by Roger Corman, this movie was made around the same time as the Corman/Vincent Price movies, and like those, it's a pretty ambitious project, much superior to Corman's earlier ultra-low budget movies such as ""Creature from the Haunted Sea"", both when it comes to production values and more importantly to the quality of the script. Ray Milland does a fine job in the lead and Diana Van der Vlis and Don Rickles also deliver good performances in this entertaining movie.",1281312000,,841,4.760273972602739

Employing such veteran actors as Ray Milland ""The Thing with Two Heads"" (1972) and the latest scientific speculation, he has brought you ""X - The Man with the X-Ray Eyes"" (1963). The message is so important that it was transferred to DVD.

Moderation in all things. What happens if you get too much of a good thing?

Dr. James Xavier finds out what it is like going beyond underwear. And into the mysteries of life. His creation of drops that let you see on a new plane can be dangerous. The more he drops the more he sees.

The visual effects are worth the movie alone. Just look what happened when he was monkeying around?

8262637,4,B0016J5E5K,"RELEASED IN 1963 and directed by Roger Corman, ""X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes"" chronicles events in Los Angeles when a doctor (Ray Milland) develops a formula that grants x-ray vision, which derails his career and forces him to join a carnival, using his new power to make a living. Diana Van der Vlis plays his disciple while Don Rickles is on hand as a carnival barker.

The early 60s vibe is to die for, but the beginning is rather dull. Things perk up at an adult party where the aging doctor tries to keep hip and eventually sees everyone nakkid (lol). The carnival sequence and what it leads into are arguably the best parts, although the Vegas and tent revival episodes have their attractions. The movie scores meh on the female front, but Lorrie Summers and Cathie Merchant have small parts.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 19 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, California & Las Vegas, Nevada. WRITERS: Robert Dillon and Ray Russell. ADDITIONAL CAST: Harold J. Stone and John Hoyt play colleagues of the doctor.

After the infamous, ""eyeball"" opening, the story begins. Xavier is very concerned about eyesight. He's been experimenting, attempting to improve vision, in order to make it possible to see things that no human eyes can perceive. When he uses a new serum on his own eyes, he develops x-ray vision! Not satisfied w/ the limited results, Xavier puts more drops in, causing unconsciousness. The board decides to remove Xavier's funding, but he doesn't let that stop him!  As a surgeon, he soon realizes there are life-saving attributes to his newfound visual powers. They also turn a dance party into something more like a trip to a nudist colony! Obviously, he keeps pouring more drops into his peepers. Just as obviously, he goes... TOO FAR! When Xavier accidentally pushes another doctor out a window, reducing him to pavement lasagna, Xavier goes into hiding. Enter Don Rickles as Crane, who puts Xavier to work as a ""mind reader"" at a carnival. Rickles is fabulous in his sleazy role as Xavier's ""manager"", w/ big ideas of promoting Xavier as a ""healer""! Meanwhile, Xavier's associate, Dr. Diane Fairfax (Diana van der Vlis) tracks him down. Together they flee, but how can Xavier escape what he has become? Ultimately, disaster strikes. Directed by the great Roger Corman, it's one of his best efforts. Watch for cameos by 50's sci fi legend, Morris Ankrum (INVADERS FROM MARS, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, KRONOS, THE GIANT CLAW), as well as Corman regulars, Dick Miller (WAR OF THE SATELLITES, A BUCKET OF BLOOD) and Jonathon Haze (NOT OF THIS EARTH, THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) as a pair of hecklers at the carnival.

Independent film director Roger Corman, whose pupils include Academy Award movie directors and actors, stays true to his unique style of film making with The Man with X-Ray Eyes. In this kitschy, offbeat, yet not corny, sci-fi drama, the story of Dr. James Xavier is told. He takes a serum and starts to develop X-ray eyes.

He goes to a go-go party and checks out the dancing pretty ladies with his suddenly found X-ray vision. Only Corman could have released such a movie. In 1963, the movie hit the screens. Not only Roger Corman fans went to see it, but others who were curious about the original movie director's style. There's simply no one who did what Corman did; he took an idea, and went full throttle with it. In this one, Dr. Xavier uses his eyes mostly for medical purposes until he meets a carnival barker played by a young actor Don Rickles, who later gained fame as a TV actor, he also played in a few movies. And standup comedy.  Anyway, the carnival barker convinces the doctor that his unique X-ray vision could be used to make money at sideshows.

Nonetheless, watching a Corman movie is a treat. I'm a fan.  I watched this one, simply because it was directed by him. His Little Shop of Horrors, I watched because it was a Broadway hit, but his other movies, including this one, I watched simply because it has the Roger Corman signature style.

Thinking about my college days, I took a three-credit college course to watch Hollywood screwball comedies. Now, I'm thinking why wasn't a college course on Roger Corman and his movies offered? I would have enjoyed discussing and analyzing The Man with the X-Ray eyes as I did with movies starring Katherine Hepburn and Gary Grant, and other screwball comedy pics.

Nevertheless, Corman's accomplishments is so clearly seen in the movie picture biz: the proof is in the pudding. Among the directors who had worked for him include Martin Scorcese, The Goodfellas, James Cameron, Titantic, Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather, and include as an ardent admirer the director Quentin Tarantino. Actors include Robert De Niro, Ray Milland and, actor/director Ron Howard, Jack Nicholson and so many more.

To put it simply, the King of Kitsch, Corman, is a living legend. And the man with the X-Ray Eyes is more of the same: fascinating cinema.",1450224000,,2338,4.76980198019802
