7802146,5,1939442176,We as a small home church purchased these dvds.  We can't get enough of them and swap them with each other every week!

Prophecy in the News is an incredible, Godly ministry that focuses on bleeding edge Biblical prophecy and often will address subjects that no one else does. This conference exemplifies that and then some.

This was Prophecy in the News's first conference and talk about kicking things off with a bang!

26 speakers.  Look at those names. Are you kidding me? You could have three or four of them as headliners anywhere, call it a day, and feel pretty good about yourself.

68 messages covering every leading and cutting edge Bible prophecy related subject you can imagine and probably a few ideas you haven't thought of, too. Even longtime prophecy buffs are sure to come away challenged and having heard some things they'd never heard before.

I could try and write a phone book to cover what a blessing and edifying overload this conference is but I'll try and keep it short and sweet.

Don't be intimidated by the running times or the disc quantities.

The packaging is downright ingenious and takes up far less space than you might imagine. Each message runs roughly an hour in length per disc so it's very easy to keep track of and use. 5 stars for organization and setup but what about the substance, which is what counts the most?

How's ""off the charts"" on substance work for you?

These are not messages that will tickle the ears to say the least but most certainly you will come away knowing without any doubt the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the fact we are living in the latter days before His return, and that His return is imminent. You will be given Biblical knowledge and tools that Christians need in these ever increasing tumultuous times that Jesus said it would be like leading up to His return. These are  messages that are timely, relevant and all ultimately point back to the saving gospel of Jesus Christ.

I purchased this set back in October when it was first released and the family and I were still leisurely making our way through messages through the New Year although we found ourselves having a very difficult time tearing ourselves away and ""moderating"" our viewing habits to only one or two messages a night.  Or in the day time. Or in between doing anything else.  ""Do we have time to watch another one before we have to go and do this?""  You get the picture.

I can guarantee you will have the same ""problem.""  This is a set that is on the reference library shelf along with other Biblically related videos and books that we can thank PITN for exposing us to that have enriched our walks with the Lord and have had us in the Scriptures more than ever before.

By and large, the churches will not touch 98 percent of the topics and material that gets mentioned here and I'm being generous. That's tragic. Christians needs to be armed in these days before Christ's return and this set will go a long ways to that end.

$150 is not cheap. I understand that although I can assure you that it's well worth the expense and I'd encourage you to view this as a reference investment because that's what it is.

However, there are more affordable alternatives to this set so all is not lost!

ALTERNATE 1:

You can either buy each of eight volumes that make up this deluxe set for $25 a piece. For example:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2012-Branson-Prophecy-Summit-Volume-1/dp/193944201X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2012 Branson Prophecy Summit Volume 1</a>

^^ That says volume 1. All you have to do is do a matching search and replace the number 1 with 2-8 for the rest of them and pick them off at your leisure.

But wait...there's more!

ALTERNATE 2:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Branson-Prophecy-Summit-Volume-1/dp/1939442001/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Branson: Prophecy Summit: Volume 1</a>

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Branson-Prophecy-Summit-at-Branson-Volume-2/dp/1939442095/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Branson: Prophecy Summit at Branson Volume 2</a>

^^

$30 each gets you a real nice sampling of some of the best messages out of the conference and I daresay will whet your appetite for the rest after that. You can't go wrong. You will be blessed and edified no matter which path you pick here.

So what did I mean in my review title when I said ""The most comprehensive and diverse Bible prophecy conference to date*""  ?

Because Prophecy in the News plans to outdo themselves this coming summer. July 26-28, 2013 at Pikes Peak Colorado. A conference even more ambitious than this one was in every category you wish to name. That's just for starters for some of the plans for 2013 according to the grapevine.

If you haven't kept tabs with this ministry I can't recommend them highly enough and encourage you to do so at the earliest opportunity.

They have a burden to share the gospel of Jesus Christ and to demonstrate beyond any doubt that we are living in the time before His imminent return. Stay tuned, because Jesus is coming soon. Keep looking up!",1364083200,2,5136,5.0165094339622645
7802148,5,1939442176,"A LOT of information on all those DVDs. Watched all of them except 2 or 3. Found the order a bit odd, the first disc has content that happened at the end of the 3 day conference. If you are interested in Bible prophecy and follow Gary Stearman, LA Marzulli, Tom Horn and others most of this will not be new to you and although the video format isn't as detailed as reading a couple of dozen books it is dynamic and entertaining and will expose you to ideas you might not otherwise read about. A nice mix of formal presentations, Q&A panels and 1 on 1 interviews. And bonus discs from Prophecy in the News archives.

Highly recommend.",1364083200,2,633,4.319327731092437
7802149,5,1939442176,"Prophecy in the News is one of the best Biblical prophecy sources, see their website also.  I have this DVD series.  The speakers are well known, extensive study and research and know their topics.  This complete set is a must for those that want to understand Biblical prophecy and Middle East news!  Also to pass on to all believers and to help those who are not so they can!",1364083200,,377,4.420289855072464
7802150,5,1939442176,"This is a tremendous bible prophecy message set with many great an interesting messages. I would say that this set is a must have for any student of bible prophecy. For me, it has only thrown more firewood on my desire to learn and understand bible prophecy, and to understand the times in which we are living. LA Marzulli, Rob Skiba, Russ Dizdar, Doug Hamp, Jonathan Cahn...etc. What more can you say, these guys have interesting messages!! I haven't regretted my purchase of this set.",1364083200,3,486,4.729411764705882
