2736669,4,B000MKXF5U,"This is a rather artsy, deliberate, even slow-moving film about a highschool rock band giving its final farewell before graduation.  When the band's two core members have a falling out, a new girl is brought in, a gangly, goofy Korean exchange student who nonetheless has the same rock'n'roll fantasy life as kids all across the globe, and turns out to be a perfect match for the other girls... The film follows the four young musicians as they frantically rehearse for a student-run show -- what's charming about the film (besides the girls, who all give striking, subdued performances) is that it's not a ""coming of age"" story, but rather it really is just about the creative process of kids being in a band, how different personalities are thrown together in the service of a song... and how much fun it can be when you finally find your audience.  Not the greatest film ever, but it'll draw you in.",1180742400,5,902,4.7025316455696204
2736670,3,B000MKXF5U,"I liked ""Linda, Linda, Linda"" for Bae Du-na's great performance. She's the most interesting actress out there right now, Korean or otherwise.

But I think that a lot of the reviews I've read here are going to mislead people.

LLL is NOT a ""punk rock movie,"" though a great punky song is a large part of he plot. It is also NOT ""lively"" or ""energetic"" except in rare spurts. This is NOT a fast-moving pop flick along the lines of a Japanese John Hughes movie or the wacky ""Kamakazie Girls.""

This is an Art House flick all the way, and falls much more squarely in the Jim Jarmusch territory. It is deliberately paced, with fairly static camera work with a storytelling style that revels in the ordinary and every day. Lots of long, uneventful sequences that are sometimes capped by a subtly hilarious bit of Bae mugging.

That said, I do think it's a quality film, and I did like it. BUT it is not a ""feel great"" pop blowout as many are contending. Let me put it this way: If Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" bored you, ""Linda Linda Linda"" will kill you.

But if you like small, slice of life films about regular people doing regular stuff, that have fine acting and are well made, this one is for you.",1178841600,21,1206,4.414414414414415
2736671,5,B000MKXF5U,"I saw this at a local arthouse theater, and loved it so much I went back and saw it several more times during its week run (ok, I had a month pass as part of a promotion, but still, it was the late show in a frigid January, and I bought the pass because of this film).  The audiences were laughing at all the right places, and broke into applause at the finish.  It's a warm, funny, fluffy delight of a punk-rock movie, with a good deal of substance underneath.

As the film opens, Shiba High School is preparing for it's annual Holly Festival, classes are off and everyone is busy setting up noodle booths or practicing for the rock concert, or just hanging out.  After a painful scene in which two ""AV geeks"" are filming a bored girl reading a paean to the these last days of freedom, as an intro to a documentary we'll see them shooting a few times through the film, we see one of the central characters, bandmember Kyoko, walking down a corridor between open classrooms looking for Kei, and immediately defining her character -- the idealized Japanese schoolgirl, energetic, social, perky, polite, the go-between and peacemaker.  She first spots Nozomi, who suggests the practice room, then asks Moe about her broken finger; Moe apologizes she cannot play with the band.

This neatly sets up the basic theme -- Kei, Kyoko, Nozomi and Moe were going to play in the concert, but now have a problem.  Kei, the acknowledged leader, decides they will play anyway, but who will replace singer-guitarist Moe?  Poking through some old tapes, they find one by the 80's Japanese punk band The Blue Hearts, and decide to go for it.  Kei will switch from keyboards to guitar, but they still need a vocalist.  In a hilarious scene, sitting slacker-style on a wall, they decide to take the first person to come along.  After a couple of false starts, along comes Son, the school's Korean exchange student, who readily agrees (and then is horrified when she finds out what she agreed to :-).

The rest of the film is in some sense formulaic -- the girls have three days to learn three songs and to mesh as a group.  They persist through daunting obstacles, bonding with each other, and through energy and talent and some luck emerge triumphant at the finale.  But it is extremely well-done formula, and there are many layers to add interest.  Each of the prime four has a distinct character -- Kyoko, as described above; Kei, somewhat of a loner; Nozomi, somewhat withdrawn and maybe with less of a future than the others; and of course Son, delightfully played by Doona [Du-Na] Bae as a fish-out-of-water, a bit shell-shocked in her new environment, who finds friendship and emerges from her shell.  We see bits of each of their family lives, which inform their individual characters.  Kei's past relations are important -- the ex-boyfriend whose studio they use, the ex-best-friend and band co-founder Rinko that she is having a frosty fight with.  The boys who are interested in Kyoko and Son.  The whole carefully shown environment of a small Japanese city and high school.

Go and check out some clips from the Japanese version and spinoff album on youtube .. search for Paranmaum as well as Linda Linda Linda.  And also search for bluehearts for the true original, and baseballbears to see Nozomi (Shiori Sekune) in her real-life band.  Aki Maeda (Kyoko) also has some rather syrupy pop ballads.

One thing -- I seriously hope this has not been dubbed into English, as the technical info seems to indicate (or at least that the original soundtrack and subtitles are available as an alternate).  Of course that would destroy the music, if that's dubbed, and switching back and forth between Japanese music and English dialogue would be too weird.  But just in general, it would seem to take away the ""listen and feel"" of the film.",1173571200,19,3824,4.7057057057057055
2736672,5,B000MKXF5U,"I have been a performer off and on for most of my life.  My best friend is in a couple bands.  Needless to say, we both loved this movie.  We caught it at the local Art House movie theatre (shout out to the great folks at Portland's Historic Hollywood Theatre!).

What's it about?  A Japanese high school girl group has a falling out with their lead singer about an incident that injures one of the other girls.  There are hurt feelings all around.  So the remaining girls decide to swap instruments and draft the local misfit (the stunningly talented super-model-turned actress Du-na Bae) Korean girl to sing lead.

Nothing turns out quite like you'd expect. There are wonderous small moments all tied together with the tour-de-force-of-nature that is Bae.  The smaller characters are well defined, and you get a real sense of this world.

Captures the feeling of giddiness/stress that is performance better than virutally any movie I've seen in years.  Do you love punk music?  Do you love movies about misfits?  Do you love films about finding your own place?  THEN RUN and get this film.  A real stunner.",1170201600,36,1108,4.757894736842105
2736673,5,B000MKXF5U,"What a great movie, very well done with great performances.  Doona Bae usually gets all the credit for the movie but I think Aki Maeda also shines bright in this story.

2736674,1,B000MKXF5U,"The story is slow and boring, too much talk, not enough action.

Good for a nap. Don't waste your time.

2736675,3,B000MKXF5U,"From beginning to end the story was interesting but it always seemed there were direction it could have taken but didn't. I added the title to my collection because it was one of Bae Doo Na's (Doona Bae in the credits) early works. I can't say I was disappointed because I didn't expect an exciting story about high school life. Characters developed but rather than growth, it was more like lateral movement. Dialogue was sparse and there was a great deal of emphasis placed on silence; presumably so the viewer could ""feel"" the moment. Surprisingly, one of the high points was an English language song performed by one of the very minor characters. Both her voice and the music were light and quivering... quite a nice combination.

I can't say it was a bad movie; just very average. There was never a moment when I was excited to be watching. I will watch it again, if only to see if there are other elements to absorb. If you're looking for a typical teen drama, this is not the film for you. If you're more interested in film as art, you may want to give it a try.",1348790400,,1068,4.4213197969543145
2736676,5,B000MKXF5U,"Forget all this nonsense you hear about Japanese kids being socially inept (yes, they are but you're comparing apples to oranges, if you're here in the West) as this flick captures exactly how kids interact at that age in Japan.

It also shows how subtle Japanese as a language is. You'll notice one-word answers a lot to questions, but watch the body language and how people say things to get the nuances.

Add to this the band rehearsal room had a poster for The Music (if you don't know this band, get their first album...you will not be disappointed) and this confirms that Japanese ""get it"" when it comes to finding what's next and important in music. Plus throw in the fact they build a movie around the most fun punk rock song (""Linda Linda"" by the Blue Hearts) to come out of Japan, and you've got yourself a winner.

Every role in this movie is spot on. The relationship between boys and girls at this age is also done to perfection. The whole thing is just a joy to see unfold.

Topping this off the extras are brilliant and not the same old, same old making of or deleted scenes. What you get are bios of the cast, an explanation section (Culture Tips) of the very J-culture things in the movie that Western audiences may not get 100% and a fun Blue Hearts FAQ done in audio form.

This is certainly one of the best coming-of-age and rock-and-roll flicks from anywhere in years.

Plus if you don't become a Blue Hearts fan after this, then you seriously need to get your ears tested.",1328832000,4,1494,4.434306569343065
2736677,5,B000MKXF5U,"""Linda Linda Linda"" is a brilliant film that captures a very natural look at rural Japanese school life.  I found this film amazing because of how much about Japanese culture you can find in it.  It's not a film pushing gimmicks and cliches...just wants to capture ""the real thing"" as they say.  The actors and actresses aren't made to look like superstars, and the plot drives this whole thing with brilliant finesse.

Basically, the film centers around 4 girls who decide to form a rock band in preparation for their High School's fall festival (festivals there are huge deals) while living their daily lives.  This film doesn't feature any flashy gimmicks and plot intrigues (such as in films like ""The Rocker"" or ""Mr. Hollands Opus"").  Instead, it focuses on their practicing and daily lives.  So, if you want a ""spine tingler"", this is not your film.  But if you want a film about friends living life and wanting to achieve a goal, this is good.  It's very slow and subtle in the beginning, so when I first saw this, I was a little worried that I might not enjoy this.  But by the end, it really was a heart warming film...in fact, it taught me to slow down a bit in my fast paced life and enjoy the subtle beauties that surround life.

This is a subtle and touching film about the value of  enjoying each moment while growing up at the same time.  Wrap it up with so many cultural practices (I do enjoy studying cultures).  Then tie it up with a ribbon of naturalness (nothing here is over produced...even their rock music sounds ""rough"" as many High School bands sound at that age)...this is a film of quiet awesomeness.

Special Features:
The special features are not particularly major or anything like that, but there are some interesting tidbits there.  They include:
1. Biographies of the Director and Cast
2. Culture tid-bits and practices relevant to the movie

2736678,4,B000MKXF5U,"I bought this DVD at a movie rental place that was going out of business.  It was selling for two bucks and I grabbed it right away because I had heard of this movie.  It's a really cute movie without being too cliche with the plot.  I'm not going to get much into the plot because so many other reviewers have already posted what the movie is about.  The only complaint that I have is with the subtitles.  One of the main characters, Son, is a Korean student who is in the process of learning Japanese.  However, I wish the subtitles did a better job of indicating whether she is speaking Korean or Japanese.  As someone who speaks a little of both, I found some parts to be endearing...where she is speaking Japanese and accidentally adding Korean words in her speech.  In most cases, there is little indication that the character is speaking Korean at all (especially when she meets an admirer who is Japanese but trying to speak Korean).  Usually, the poor Japanese/Korean speaking is indicated by an ellipsis in the movie.  While this can show that she is struggling with the language, for most people, it might just look like she is speaking slowly.  It's such a tiny complaint and I'm sorry that it's a little nit-picky.  I just feel like some of the charm is lost in the subtitles.",1322438400,,1289,4.508620689655173
2736679,5,B000MKXF5U,"Nobuhiro Yamashita's Linda Linda Linda is not only a feel-good movie, it is a feel-great movie that had the audience dancing in the aisles (figuratively, if not literally). Yamashita has managed to put together not only one of the best rock films but also one of the most truly honest films I have seen about what life is like for teenagers. It also has a very infectious song, Linda Linda Linda, arranged by former Smashing Pumpkin James Iha that will roll around forever inside your brain. The songs are not lip-synced but are actually performed by the talented actress musicians.

The plot is simple and can be summarized in a paragraph or two but the strength of the film is not in its story but in its quirky humor, natural conversations, great music, and the small moments that convey the roller coaster existence of high school life. Four girls attending Shibazaki High School in Japan want to compete at the annual Holly Rock Festival but things are not going their way. With less than three days before the competition, Moe (Shione Yukawa), the lead guitarist, has just broken two fingers in an accident and is unable to play. Two members, Kei (Yu Kashii) and Rinko (Takaya Mimura) have had a falling out and are not on speaking terms.

Kei (Yu Kashii) and Rinko (Takaya Mimura) have had a falling out over Rinko's attempt to recruit a boy to play in the band and are not on speaking terms. A patchwork solution is proposed where Kei decides to be the guitarist while Kyoko (Aki Maeda) moves to drums and Nozomi (Shiori Sekine) plays the bass. All that is left is to find a singer and a song, no small task. With days left to prepare, the girls agree to choose the first person who walks in the corridor in front of them. Since the first person was a boy, they decide to pass. They also pass on Rinko, a vocalist they used in a former band.

Since Rinko doesn't want to sing the song they've chosen, they pick the next girl walking by, a Korean exchange student named Son (Bae Du-na) who agrees to sing but without much knowledge of Japanese, rehearsals are a struggle to communicate. Calling themselves the Paran Maum, the girls have to sneak around the school and rehearse at night, often falling asleep on the floor.

The pace of the film is slow and the girls face challenges but they are real life events, not ""movie"" problems. Kyoko is attracted to Kazuya (Katsuya Kobayashi) but needs to find the confidence to let him know. Kei must learn to work within the confines of a group and give up some control and Son has to become comfortable enough with the language to perform.

While the story may sound like a teenage soap opera, Linda Linda Linda stays away from clich and the film is without contrived plot twists or dramatic confrontations with parents (who are mostly non-existent in the film). Along the way, however, there are some very endearing moments. One is Son's attempt to enter a karaoke club without buying a drink and her back and forth conversation with the attendant borders on the painfully hilarious.

Another great scene is when a young boy tries to communicate in broken Korean to Son that he loves her but there is more than a language barrier. The acting in Linda Linda Linda is uniformly excellent, especially the performance of Bae Du-na who moves from being shy and inarticulate to front and center stage and sweeps you away with her great smile. The ending of the film is so perfect that I dare not give it away except to say that the feeling the film leaves you with is one of pure and simple joy.",1309564800,,3541,4.568503937007874
2736680,5,B000MKXF5U,"Linda Linda Linda (2005, Japan) relates the endearing and humorous story of a group of four high school girls who put their hearts into performing as a rock band at their high school's festival.

With talented actresses, an original script, and a simple storyline, director Nobuhiro Yamashita creates an innocent and tender reality.  This high school lacks social prejudices and high school cliques.  It could be considered a ""girl power"" film or subtly a ""gender-bender"" one.  It is what life, or at least high school, would look like if 'girls could be girls.'

Driven by friendship and dedication, and undeterred by their imperfect music skills, the four unpretentious girls are determined to perform together as a band.  Practicing incessantly and under time pressure, each band member has charm in her own humble way.  Bae Doona in particular, the school's foreign exchange student from Korea and lanky-legged wide-eyed vocalist, overcomes her initial foreign language and singing insecurities to add color to the otherwise quiet and mundane suburban high school.  Somewhat androgynous in their uniforms, messy hair, scuffed knees and no make-up, the girls challenge the passive and/or cute Japanese school girl stereotype and put their energy and emotions not into securing a boyfriend or beating teenage awkwardness but rather into making an all-girl rock band work as a team.

The film is also memorable for its music--the catchy rock songs the girls rehearse are from the now classic 80's Japanese band ""The Blue Hearts.""

2736681,5,B000MKXF5U,"The great mythologist Joseph Campbell summarized a hero's journey as follows: A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man. That is an apt description of the path followed by our hero in this movie, the winsome Korean exchange student Son. She is a stranger in a strange land, attending high school in Japan though barely able to speak Japanese. Son accepts her call to adventure without even knowing it: she unwittingly agrees to be the lead singer of an all-girl punk band for the school rock festival. While those who aren't paying attention may find this movie a bit slow, by the end of this movie you'll be on the edge of your seat, rooting for Son to hit the crowd with everything she's got. Warning: Michael Bay would HATE this movie: no hyperbolic, inflated plot devices, no lifeless, stereotypical characters. If that sounds good to you, I can't possibly recommend this movie highly enough. And the music is AWESOME!",1303084800,,1138,4.781725888324873

2736683,5,B000MKXF5U,"Here's a sweet, lovely coming-of-age film that sneaks up on the viewer with its subtle wit & accurate portrayal of all the awkwardness, idealism, and intensity of high school life. The plot is the thinnest of threads -- when their guitarist injures a finger, the remaining members of an all-girl band have to reconfigure, inviting a Korean exchange student to be their new lead vocalist. Will they get it together in time to play their graduation gig?

As I said, the thinnest of threads -- but what charming & believable characters! And that's what really counts in this film. While it may seem slow at first, it beautifully weaves together the lives of these four girls, revealing them in all their confusion & determination. Anyone who remembers high school will recognize some parts of their own past here, both the embarrassing & the nostalgic. How desperately important everything seemed then! And the film gets that feeling exactly right.

Those who expect a faster-paced film may be disappointed at first. But stick with it! Before long you'll find yourself absorbed in the lives of these young women, nodding & smiling (and occasionally squirming) at things you remember from your own youth. It's so much more rewarding than the typical Hollywood teen film, and it gets richer with repeated viewings, too -- highly recommended!",1289520000,2,1336,5.013513513513513

2736686,3,B000MKXF5U,"I recently watched this video & I have to admit, I was dissapointed. It had been touted as one of THE best J-films to come over in the past few years, but I've seen far better.

The storyline is a sweet one, concerning a bunch of schoolgirls who must try to overcome several barriers (fights, language barriers) to make a band that can successfully sing at the upcoming school festival. Several parts of the story are cute, such as the Korean foreign exchange student who speaks little Japanese. However there are also several parts to the film where the film just lags & I found myself getting incredibly bored. The film just can't go beyond being merely ""cute"" into that realm where the movie is truly memorable. I honestly don't think I'll ever watch it again & even now parts of the film are so forgettable even though I watched it less than a day ago. Even so, the best part of the film is undeniably the end & most will be able to enjoy the energy of that last scene where they play together successfully as a band. I just wish that they hadn't taken so long to get to that point. Clocking in at just over 2 hours, I felt like I'd been sitting there for every bit of that two hours. Taking 20-30 minutes off the film would greatly have improved it.

All in all, it was an enjoyable enough film. People who enjoy such films will like it, but those who aren't already fans of ""slice of life"" J-films will not be converted by this picture. I'd give it about a C (3 stars) for effort.",1219536000,,1486,4.303571428571429
2736687,5,B000MKXF5U,"This movie brought me back to a happier time in life before work became all consuming. I was a Foreign Exchange student going to Kansai Gaidai in Osaka, Japan and learning Japanese. At the end of the school year, there was a school festival with lots of food, games, and entertainment. Whatever your interests are there is a club for you. I started out checking out the Classical guitar club, then moved on to the Jazz/blues club, and finally ended up in a Japanese Death Metal club. I never thought I would hear death metal in Japan, but I was wrong. I would play guitar with those guys. It was cool.
Also, at the school cafeteria, there was a stage set up with drums and different instruments. It easy to put a band together. You just have to get on stage and start playing.
The movie showed what the school festival is like at the high school level. It also showed how committed those girls were to making it work and operating as a solid unit.
They stayed up all night and day just to learn 3 songs, whereas other people in different countries would probably just wing it and hope for the best.
Linda, Linda, Linda starts out slow but it does increase little by little until the rocking finish. The pace of the movie didn't bother me at all. What I liked about it was the day in the life quality it has. Its not just about being a Japanese student going to a Japanese high school because there's more going on. I think it has universal appeal because it shows things that every student goes through like the need for friends, spending time with friends, everyone working together toward a common goal, crushes that work and go no where, and the sense that Senior year will never happen to you again so you have to make the best of it.
The soundtrack is one of my favorite parts of the movie. I love the Blue Hearts now. During the ending credits you can hear their song Owaranai Uta which has a driving beat and fun punk quality to it.
I don't think you will be disappointed in this film unless slow pacing bothers you but sometimes life is like that it has those wonderful slow moments.",1209427200,4,2091,4.377892030848329

It may be about Japanese teenage girls, but it sure reminded me of me and my friends growing up.  When are adventures did not actually involve doing anything, but some how remained the part of growing up that I remember even now.  Plus, the soundtrack is great and if you are not inspired to track down The Blue Hearts, well then there is something wrong with you.

Now the remaining girls need to train a new singer only days before the gig.  They recruit a Korean exchange student who can barely speak the language.
The themes that run throughout the film are more complex than the plot.  Friendship, memories, love, the end of one era of one's life and the start of a new one.

Is this wind the same as the one blowing the day after tomorrow?  Will and courage will be kept in the same pocket.  This is our kingdom.  2004 Shiba High Holly Festival.""

That message spoken by a student of Shibazaki High School, has a twinge of poignancy.  Second year in high school is indeed the last time high school students have fun.  After that, they have to study like crazy for college entrance exams, to become adults in the real world.

At the school festival, ""bunkasai"" for those in the know, four girls want to do a band, but their guitarist Moe injures herself.  An argument between keyboardist Kei and Rinko, both of who are short-tempered, results in the latter departing.  The band, minus Moe and Rinko, consists of drummer Kyoko, shy bassist Nozomi, and Kei, now on guitar.

However, without Moe-chan, they can't write their own songs, nor have a lead singer, so they have to go the cover band route.  Upon hearing 80's punk band the Blue Hearts' ""Linda Linda"", they decide to do three songs, that one, ""My Right Hand,"" and the angst-ridden, but overall refreshing ""Endless Song.""

On an irresponsible whim and mostly to spite Rinko, Kei recruits Son, a painfully shy Korean exchange student whose grasp at Japanese is manageable at best.  She is at first horrified to realize what she has talked herself into, but decides to do it, becoming chummy with her new friends.  Most of the best scenes involve her, such as when she and Kei talk at the bus stop.  Son's problems in understanding a karaoke place where she has to buy a drink to sing poses a humorous situation, as she wants to sing and not drink, but the clerk tells her she has to buy a drink.  And she's just wonderful when she strolls out on the abandoned festival grounds, verbally imagining the scene, passing by the booths, then going on stage, and introducing the band.  Heck, one boy even confesses his feelings for her, trying to speak good Korean.

Kyoko, the drummer, is doing double duty helping out with a banana stand for the culture fest.  But she's also the most diplomatic and friendly, concerned about her fellow members as well as trying not to let her friends be put down.  And she seems to have feelings for the shy and awkward Kazuya.  Aki Maeda was a wonderful choice to play the lovable and friendly Kyoko.

It's enjoyable seeing the quartet practicing for their gig, hanging out with each other, and sharing this wonderful time together, even in a scene when they sneak into the band room at night, quietly singing and playing quietly so as not to get caught.

This is a interesting departure for Bae Du Na, having appeared in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and the Ring Virus.  She is lovable and credible as Son.

I saw this movie on the plane coming back from Japan to America, and I loved every minute of it, anything for one last drop of Japanese culture.  It helped me make up my mind to go back to Japan one day.  Thanks, girls.  And ex-Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha's moody but reflective keyboard music score is perfect!

Trivia: the name of the Jitterin' Jinn song about the upside down giraffe that cracks Kei up is ""Purezento"" or ""Present.""

After high school, comes the beginning of the students' wonderful endless song, per the Blue Hearts:  ""Let's sing a endless song, for this a--hole of a world/Lets sing a endless song, for all the trash out there/Let's sing a endless song, for me, and you, and them out there/Let's sing a endless song, so that we can all laugh tomorrow.""",1181865600,9,3817,4.516788321167883
2736692,5,B000MKXF5U,"Japanese indie film ""Linda Linda Linda"" follows the story of four high school girls who need to learn to play the songs of the Blue Hearts, 80s Japanese punk rock band, for the annual school festival. They got only three days to practice, and the vocal happens to be an international student from Korea. But can they master the songs and play them in front of the audiences?

The story is simple. As two girls recently left the group, three remaining members of the band Kyoko (Aki Maeda, ""Battle Royale""), Kei (Yu Kashii) and Nozomi (Shiori Sekine) have to find a vocalist for the new band. They recruit a timid Korean exchange student Son (Du-na Bae, ""The Host""), who, as it turns out, shows unexpected side of her character as she keeps practicing.

[SLOW-MOVING BUT TOUCHING] First, keep this in mind before watching ""Linda Linda Linda"" of which mood is something different from such films as, say, ""School of Rock"" or ""Hard Day's Night"" (both my favorite films). The catchy Blue Hearts songs are wonderful and the rock concert scenes are full of energy, but the greatness of director Nobuhiro Yamashita is that he not only succeeded in expressing the youthful energy of high school girls, but also cleverly suggesting that the girls are leaving behind their younger days though they themselves are not aware of it.

To fully enjoy ""Linda Linda Linda,"" please remember these things. Annual high school festivals (usually called ""bunka-sai"" in Japanese) are usually held in autumn and the girls are in the third (and last) year of high school. That means this is their final chance to join in the bunka-sai of their school. Son will go back to her country and most probably they will not play together again. Yamashita inserts several episodes or images that imply the festival (or the sweet, joyful days of youth) is going to be over soon - the images of deserted schoolyard or one of the girl's ex-boyfriend leaving the town, for instance. Only grown-ups around the girls know this fact (listen carefully the words from the teacher), but the girls themselves do not seem to realize this, or even if they do, they don't understand the meaning of it ... until long after their youth is past.

The film deftly captures the atmosphere of high school festivals in Japan. I can assure you the authenticity of each scene of the film because I was once a high school student there. So much time and efforts are put into ""bunka-sai"": classrooms are turned into shops selling noodles, ice cream stand, rock music club or ""haunted house."" It is precious moment of life, which becomes part of bitter-sweet memories of youth only after you realize you have left it behind forever.

The acting is uniformly great, especially the brilliant performance from Du-na Bae as Son, who is to be seen in ""The Host,"" a 2006 mega-hit in South Korea. In fact she might be a bit too old to play the role Son (Du-na Bae was about 25 years-old at the time of shooting), but her spontaneous and lively performance makes us forget that. The film is also benefited from the authentic location as it was shot in the real, now disused building of Maebashi Industrial High School in Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture, which had recently moved to another location.

""Linda Linda Linda"" uses a slightly downbeat approach in telling the story, avoiding the cliched plot devices. It is sometimes slow-moving, but in moving slowly, it shows a realistic portrait of high school life in Japan. Wherever you are, you will see it is an amusing and touching film that captures the essence of youth.",1180828800,22,3551,4.765853658536585

The movie really captures the spirit of being a teenager and also show that sometimes you do something big (like join a band and play music) just because - for no other  particular reason other than to have an adventure and express yourself.

Linda Linda Linda was one that I read good reviews about, but could not find a legitimate online source to view, so I bought the DVD. It is an enjoyable movie about high school angst. I would call it a subtle comedy. Humor runs throughout the movie, but does not slap you in the face. I actually like the girls rendition of the song Linda Linda better than the original. Bae Doona makes the movie work and it is one of my favorite films by her.",1377561600,2,569,4.080357142857143
