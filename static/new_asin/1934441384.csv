There is quite a lot of information that you can garner from its full breadth of knowledge.

The program is divided into 8 sections:

DVD 1:
This DVD features a coffee table conversation between Daniel Goleman (our host throughout the series) and Daniel J. Siegel, discussing `The Leaders Mind'.  The debate covers great topics such as: the brain and emotional intelligence; the truth behind gut feelings; explanation of self-mastery; the science behind what motivates people and adaption to change; the development of self-awareness in a leader; developing understanding of the inner world of others; and creating resonant relationships.

This DVD is great for focusing and developing a prospective leader to become `the leader'.  The main concepts focus around the fundamentals of leadership and methods for developing your leadership style.

DVD 2:
We join Daniel Goleman and Warren Bennis as they discuss `The Socially Intelligent Leader' in this DVD.  Goleman and Bennis focus on six primary topics a leader should use to connect with their team.  These topics include noticing what is  important (in terms of for progress and development); connecting with heart to your team; becoming aware of blind spots; where self-awareness and vulnerability fit in; the ingredients of high-performing teams; and learning from crucible moments.

What I most enjoyed about this particular discussion was the talk of self-awareness and vulnerability.  I recently watched a TED Talk concerning vulnerability and how it is important, to an extent, to being a powerful and self-confident person in your own standing.  I enjoyed making that connection between that talk and this discussion between Goleman and Bennis.

DVD 3:
`Getting beyond Yes' is a dialogue between Goleman and Erica Ariel Fox, focused on negotiating.  More than a debate about getting the most favorable terms in contracts and life, Goleman and Fox break down the fundamentals of getting more than just an agreement to terms but developing something more solid and beneficial to both sides.  The exchange breaks the topic down into: positions verses interests;  how you can separate people (emotions) from the problem;  fundamentals of the Getting Beyond Yes method; how to find the negotiator within your own self; how to read the room (from tension to emotions); and wrapping up your negotiation.

The exchange of ideas is particularly worthwhile to those who have difficulty making a case for their point (side).  Negotiation is a skill, that is developed through practice and determination, however many of the principles of this discussion could be useful to just about anyone in any field.

DVD 4:
Here we join Goleman and Claudio Fernndez-Aroz on `Talent Strategy'.  Fernndez-Aroz makes six key topics the frame of his discussion including: How to go about making people selection decisions; the 7 key points of great people decisions; how the political or public sector can make better people hiring decisions; selecting the most ethically sound candidates; the good and bad of using of committees for selecting talent; and how emotional intelligence should be weighted in selecting candidates.

This tte--tte is a good look at the many decisions facing recruiters and human resources departments today.  With the corruption we have seen from several private sector companies, the candid talk on choosing and developing more ethical candidates in business schools and through leadership training couldn't come at a more desperate time in America.

DVD 5:
`Authentic Leadership' is an exchange with Bill George, a professor of Management at Harvard Business School.  Six topics are highlighted including: what is authentic leadership; the inner work of leaders; how to lead with ethical standards; how to feel the mission you are tasked with; a brief look at leaders today and how leadership is developed through change  (ex. Howard Shultz); and how to find authenticity in candidates when finding and promoting leaders.

DVD 6:
In `Create to Innovate', Goleman sits down with Teresa Amabile to explore both creativity and innovation in the workplace.  The conversation focuses on: what creativity and innovation are;  how a leader can manage and promote creativity; how to optimize the creative environment; how to encourage and cultivate creativity; and finally, how you can develop your own creative style in a world that is demanding more innovative candidates.

Also featured on this disc is a talk with Peter Senge on `Learning Organizations Beyond the 5th Discipline'.

DVD 7:
In `Todays Leadership Imperative', Goleman engages with Howard Gardner, who teaches at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.  This lively banter focuses on: leadership and multiple intelligences; the importance of storytelling in becoming an effective leader; the importance of truth in leadership (the story you tell); development of an ethical mind; how `good work' is defined and why it matters to leaders; and the seven levers of leadership.

DVD 8:
`High Performance Leadership' pits Goleman with George Kohlrieser as they discuss how leaders move to the next step in being highly effective.  This chat covers: using the mind's eye; leading through change; the art of relationships (building and strengthening); the power of language; managing conflict; insights on negotiation tactics; developing trust with leaders; and the importance of positivity in high performance leaders.

Overall, this entire collection of insightful conversations with well-respected members of their field is really fantastic.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEADERSHIP-A-MASTER-CLASS-with-Daniel-Goleman/dp/1934441384/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEADERSHIP: A MASTER CLASS with Daniel Goleman</a>&nbsp;would be great for personal development or use in a corporate setting to develop promising candidates into leadership positions.

7801889,5,1934441384,"Daniel Goleman, the author of Social Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence, assembled and conducted interviews with nine world-class experts on the subject of leadership.  The interview with Peter Senge is slightly shorter than the other interviews and is called a bonus.

The video/audio quality of the interviews is outstanding.  The videos were professionally shot with a high definition camera - so the quality is first class.  The audio quality is equally first class.

Mr. Goleman did a remarkable job of assembling world-class talent.  This group represents the best of the best among the thought leaders of leadership.  While different people will have different ideas on the most impressive of this group, I have to single out Claudio Fernandez-Araoz, Bill George and George Kohlrieser as delivering outstanding presentations. In my opinion, Erica Ariel Fox's interview was the most engaging and value packed.

This presentation is all about leadership.  So it is a good idea to focus on what leadership means.  Daniel Goleman gave a good definition of leadership: Leadership is the art of getting work done or goals attained through the work of other people.  There is a difference between management and leadership.  This Master Class is about leadership - how and what it takes to be a world-class leader.

I am an avid reader, averaging one non-fiction book per week.  But I was struck by a significant difference between a book and these DVD interviews.  Most people write much different than they talk.  I have read books by some of the participants in this program.  I found the level of communication to be significantly better in this program than in the writings of the participants.  The interviews were very conversational.  The experts had abandoned their structured writing style and were simply talking with Dan.  I was impressed with the depth of knowledge each expert possessed and how easily and thoughtfully they could talk about their subject.

When reading a book I find I don't usually come away with a feeling of connection to the author.  Watching these videos, I could see the facial expressions, hear the voice inflection, watch the physical gestures - I found that I was feeling quite connected to the authors.  I think the average person will find a much stronger connection to the experts and their message by watching these DVDs.

There is one downside to watching rather than reading.  There are so many gems of wisdom that the experts provide that it would be easy for the listener to miss some.  You will need to watch these interviews more than once to be able to absorb all the outstanding information contained in them.

Here is a sample of some of the gems of wisdom contained in this program:

We all tend to make snap judgments.  These are usually long on snap and short of judgment.

There is a high degree of dishonesty in our current society.  This is largely due to the fact there is no safe place to be honest.  In your family or work life, where is it safe to be honest?

We all know about the devil's advocate.  Why not become an angel advocate.  Instead of being negative, shooting down ideas, offer support and encouragement.

The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed.

If you are looking to improve your leadership skills this is a great place to start.  One of the themes repeated throughout the program is that great leadership starts within.  You must work on yourself first.

Erica Ariel Fox made a profound observation during her interview.  She said you cannot learn a subject by reading books on it, attending a seminar or workshop.  To learn you must do.  You can learn ABOUT leadership from this program. To really learn leadership, you must actually put the concepts into practice.

Highly recommended for anyone committed to improving themselves and their leadership skills.

7801890,5,1934441384,"Years ago, I began to recommend books that I thought should be added to what is, in effect, an in-house business library that almost any organization should have, whatever its size and nature may be. In recent years, with the rapid and extensive emergence of electronic devices as well as CDs and then DVDs that feature business thought leaders, I am especially alert to digital material to be recommended to the aforementioned in-house business library. Leadership: A Master Class is what I would characterize as a ""must have""weath of resources. It consists of interviews conducted by Daniel Goleman of Daniel Siegel, (""The Leader's Mind""), Warren Bennis (""The Socially Intelligent Leader""), Erica Ariel Fox (Getting Beyond Yes""), Caludio Fernndez-Aroz (""Talent Strategy""), Bill George (""Authentic Leadership""), Teresa Amabile (""Create to Innovate""), Howard Gardner (""Today's Leadership Imperative""), and George Kohlrieser (""High Performance Leadership""). A bonus interview of Peter Senge is included.

Each of the interviews is in fact a lively as well as thoughtful and thought-provoking conversation, about an hour in length and co-produced by Mobius Executive Leadership and More Than Sound. As I watched each, I felt as if I were in a home and observing two brilliant people share their thoughts and feelings about important subjects of mutual interest. Goleman explains, ""I developed Leadership: A Master Class to provide cutting edge insights into today's management best practices and EI [emotional intelligence] research from world-class thought leaders. The masters in this series have decades of experience and proven track records of success in leadership, organizational research, psychology, negotiation, senior hiring, and more. This ground breaking series allows individuals and organizations alike access to top-level training from some of the brightest minds in the business world.""

Goleman makes an especially important point: This set of DVDs offers a wealth of information, insights, and counsel that individual executives (both leaders and those who aspire to be) cannot obtain from another single source. In the ideal business school, these ten (including Goleman and Senge) would be members of its faculty. Think of the set as a source for nine lengthy informal but rigorous discussions of leadership issues that are most relevant to a current and imminent global business world within which turbulent change is the only constant. So I urge both individuals and organizations to purchase and then make frequent and effective use of the material.
