8165042,5,B000LXGVHW,"I met Little Hawk many years ago at my father Chief Black Hawk San Carlo's Powwow. Kent was very distinguished looking and we all enjoyed his flute playing and story telling. I think Little Hawk is a fine performer and Story teller. And everyone should have him at their Pow wow, Tribal functions or Schools. The Kids love him and you will to. This Video is fun filled.

8165043,5,B000LXGVHW,These stories should be told in school for children three to eight yrs. old. It teaches them about life's lessons. I highly recommend this product.,1199145600,,147,4.92
8165044,5,B000LXGVHW,"Little Hawk is both entertaining and educational.  The storytelling aspect is appropriate for elementary students and touches on such topics as diversity, racism, prejudice, ecology, basic morals/principles, life skills, self-discipline and responsibility.

Little Hawk has real presence and an authentic gift of storytelling that's come down through the ages.  He engages the listener with varied voices and hand gestures, which he encourages the listeners to try.  The classic art of storytelling is kept alive through this interactive use of tactile and auditory stimulation.  For example, when describing a bear, Little Hawk shows the hand gestures or symbol for BEAR and changes his voice to create the feel of the character.

Each story can be used as a lesson in advocating the golden rule among students.  Each story can also introduce a topic for writing stories (or story telling for the non-writers).  The bonus features will appeal to people of all ages.  Little Hawk shares himself with the viewer and reminds us all that we should be living in a GOOD way.  He teaches lessons of simple and basic truths that are universal.

This creative and beautiful use of multimedia is a success on many levels.  Students enjoy movies and this one teaches and entertains.  Little Hawk is an honest look at the ancient power of the art of storytelling.
