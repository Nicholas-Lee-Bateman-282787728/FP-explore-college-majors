8135757,5,B000H0M40C,"Excellent biography and photography.  It was very interesting trying to separate the history from mythology or ancient mythology.  Another interesting part was trying to find Vineland, and where the grapes were actually found.  Why Leif Ericson chose that name was also very interesting.  It is interesting to know about the Vikings and their explorations, the fact that they had no map or compass to guide them.",1401148800,2,412,5.196969696969697
8135758,4,B000H0M40C,"This DVD covers a pretty dry subject, but is very informative.  Leonard Nimoy narrates and even though it's more of a documentary in style, there are some live shots of researchers/archaeologists.",1380153600,2,196,5.32258064516129
8135759,5,B000H0M40C,"After reading the previous review, I decided I would love to see this dvd; so, I bought it.  The other person may have given it only 2 stars, but as far as I am concerned, this dvd is a 5 start production.  It does a great job of describing the westward exploration of the Vikings.  A good overview is given regarding their journey from their native Scandinavian lands to Iceland, Greenland and Canada.  Evidence that the Vikings made it to the New World is drawn from the sagas and archeological findings in North America.  The dvd gives what it promises....",1225065600,15,559,4.55
8135760,2,B000H0M40C,"I am guessing that countless Americans learned in school about Eric the Red, Leif Ericson, and their exploits.  Thus, so much of this work repeats what most people already know.  I love documentaries that show indigenous artwork or Renaissance or Impressionist paintings that describe the contemporary culture.  However, this work had cartoon-like drawings that could have come from a ""Thor"" comic book.

The most valuable part of this documentary is that they compared Columbus' expedition to the Vikings.  It carefully spells out why the Genovese had a much greater impact on North America than his Norse predecessors did.

Leonard Nimoy narrates.  Star Trek fans who worship him may want to see this work for that reason alone.  (Unlike in that ""Simpsons"" episode spoofing ""The X-Files,"" Nimoy narrates for the whole piece without leaving.  LOL!)  Interviewees use ""Eskimo"" when the preferred term is now ""Inuit.""

This may be a nice piece to show in elementary and high school classes.  It may be especially appreciated in Minnesota or other regions with many Scandinavian Americans.",1170892800,9,1087,5.255813953488372
