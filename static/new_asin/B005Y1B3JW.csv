4904108,5,B005Y1B3JW,"Picked randomly from the Pay-Per-View menu, UNDOCUMENTED is my surprise find of the year.  I hesitate to call it my pleasant surprise, because while the discovery of a true horror gem flying under the radar can really warm my cockles, once the action here gets rollin', I was feeling more cold chills than warm fuzzies.

What starts off as a fairly routine shot-on-video, found footage movie quickly turns into a visceral and all-too-believable nightmare of American patriotism run amok. Our heroes and the immigrants they were following have been captured by a group of extreme nationalists who are looking to save our country by cleansing of the scourge that's ruining it. In other words, undocumented Mexicans sneaking over the border.

What really drove this home for me was how possible every horrific image or idea you're subjected is.  As a country, we seem to have lost our minds on this subject. The inhuman acts going on right now in Arizona are not that far off from what's happening at the abandoned slaughterhouse in the movie.  As a matter of fact, I wouldn't be surprised if something like is actually was going on...right now.  Our villains here are not raving madmen.  On the contrary, they are well spoken....charming, even...guys you'd probably love to have a beer with sometime in other circumstances.  These men spill poison from their mouths, calmly. Rationally.  Indeed, there might be a nugget of truth to it; a truth twisted into something hideous, but truth nonetheless.  And part of me started to believe it.  Just a little....teeny....tiny...bit.

Therein lies the horror.

4904109,2,B005Y1B3JW,"Please let me begin by saying that I wish the entire ""found footage"" genre (along with 3-D) would be treated like fine china... Use it on special occasions, but otherwise keep it out of sight.

I had read several good reviews about Undocumented so I decided to check it out.  From the start, I'd have to say the acting was decent.  Some of it coming across a little bit forced, but good.  The story line is was got me interested in the first place, by now I assume you know what it's about so I won't mull over plot details here, and it was pretty solid.  The downfall of this movie, and the reason for the 2 star review, is the movie, very quickly, gets caught up in the trappings of it's genre.  Much like PA3, there were several times I actually said out loud, ""Just drop the camera!""  This happens way to much in the found footage genre.  You've committed yourself the gimmick, but at some point it just makes your characters look stupid... ""My life is in danger, I'm going to die, but I have to get this shot?!""  No, sorry.  In most cases, we are talking about ordinary people put into extraordinary situations.  Situations in which any level headed person would drop the camera and run for their life.  It's just so... tired.

The worst part of the film though, comes with only a few minutes left.  The movie is about an hour and a half long.  For the first hour and twenty-five minutes it's a found footage film.  Then, with five minutes left, when it can no longer make use of it's own genre, it just switches up to a regular movie.  The characters leave the camera behind, yet we still see everything that's going on!  Again, they fell into the trappings of the genre of film... until it just stopped working... then they just said, ""Screw it!""

If this movie were a straight forward thriller, keeping all the plot lines and actors in tact, I'd give it 4 stars.  As is, 2 stars.  And that's only because I really like some of the actors in it, otherwise meh.",1335312000,,1967,4.363636363636363

4904111,2,B005Y1B3JW,"A muddled hybrid between Blair Witch Project and the Saw movies, ""Undocumented"" never manages to create the sense that you're watching real documentary footage, making each new ""sadistic torture"" scenario more unbelievable than the last. If these scenes of torment and danger had some creative wit to them then at least the movie might have achieved a semblance of social satire, but ultimately it is just a silly gorefest that exploits the illegal immigrant issue.

I watched this because I'm a Scott Mechlowicz fan. He has done much better work in other films and should consider firing his agent over this mess.",1332806400,4,614,5.019607843137255
4904112,5,B005Y1B3JW,"This is a genuinely shocking and disturbing horror movie.  It starts with a slow, dreadful build, and tricks you a little bit in the first act.  Then it becomes an absolutely nightmarish journey through the depths of self-righteous nationalistic sadism.  The cherry on top is an amazing performance by Peter Stormare--whose face is never even revealed.",1332633600,,352,5.25
4904113,5,B005Y1B3JW,"The film Undocumented remains right now one of the most fascinating 'little known'movies I have viewed this year , and next year I am pretty convinced it's going to be amongst the as of then months' new cult classics. The film is not an attempt to attack patriotism per ce. It observes patriotism from a lot of angles and not just one or two angles. The film deals with the consequences of why the Obama administration and other U.S. administrations had left American Civilians and worked against U.S. interests in such terms as with immigration policies and especially people who have been termed illegal immigrants. In my country there are no borders so I don't know with absolute certainty what it's like to live in a place with borders. Following the flawed policy of centralizing everything , the Obama Administrations decides to declare on it's own terms who are to be it's allies in battling the problem of 'illegal immigration'to the point that it keeps losing rather than gaining any votes. Despite requests to leave and have themselves replaced by authentic individuals representing those who would elect them to run for themselves rather than to run for persons supporting themselves with private funding while they'd remain in office , the characters representing the Obama Administration tried everything in their power to prevent any real change to occur , resulting in the downfall of the Obama administration and everything it had claimed officially to stand for. The end of the Obama administration had come shortly after the Obama characters had come to power , and faced with the overwhelming presence of extreme and furious anger by the American People , the Obama Admin cared for nothing and no one , and kept staying in power , with the official explanation being that they were doing it 'to preserve the interests of their supporters and the American People', with the American People already not wanting them to be in power. Hatred , corruption and fear are believed by many to be amongst the many trademarks that stand for the current Obama administration , in light of how it has behaved in regard to U.S. interests and the American People. It's undeniable state of undeniable denial is already there before the world to see , and that denial to confront reality and resign from power has caused them to throw themselves into a lake of fire from which there will be no turn - the fire of ceaseless and merciless criticism. Understandably a lot of militias and individuals opposing tyrannical government and opression have come together to stop the overwhelmness the Obama Administration has tried to enforce upon the American People against their will , while refusing to listen to public demands and resign or face impeachment. Indefinite Intention and the seizure of farms were just two of the numerous things which would never have happened in America if there were not so many idiots allowing that to happen. But it happened. It is as it is and so people respond with uprising. In many ways this films reminds me a bit of Salo , or 120 Days of Sodom , but is in certain areas a bit more brutal , more intense , and more shocking. Perhaps it is after having watched Salo a few times one starts getting used to it and can share it with other members of one's family who will usually remain stiff with fear upon having watched it for the first time. The end of the Obama administration is no longer 'around the corner'. It's time for the Obama administration to face this end , because that end is the consequences of self - inflicted wounds. Society has changed. Zionism and extremist centrist politics are no longer tolerated. What the Bushes had hoped for , 'the NWO'has failed to manifest itself as an idea because the presence of intelligent people in this world is far more tangible than they'd have liked to believe , whether their supporters like it or not. Undocumented turned out surprisingly good in my opinion - it filled me with a sense of much inner strength I had felt I had been missing during the past days (I'm an artist and a writer). The message of this film is plain and clear; the Earth doesn't have to be made into a place where everyone wants to leave. Let's make the Earth a place where as many as possible will want to stay on - or Terra , as I guess the Earth will be called increasingly.......our planetary home , without any need for everything to be centralized. I am truly sorry that my comment is rather awkard , but I give this film five stars. Well done. Extremely good job. After the film ended I wondered what it'd be like if somebody from another planet would threat people from Earth as 'illegal immigrants'if they got helped to arrive to that planet.......where they will be the aliens.",1332547200,2,4752,4.705882352941177

8488991,5,B005Y1B3JW,"I detest found footage films, but this is a rare instance where it actually works. The cameras stay on the action so I forget it was a found footage. The storyline is about a gut-wrenching situation. The gore is mostly left to your imagination, which is a more horrifying to portray the violence. I can't remember seeing another film that actually made me feel sick. Although the movie is not true, groups like the ones in this movie do exist.

8488994,2,B005Y1B3JW,"Undocumented  IFC Midnight Not Rated 2010 DVD

The title and subject sound like a Greenberg documentary about the plight of illegal immigrants.  Perhaps if you combined Greenberg and Hostel youd end up with something like this.  It is not a documentary but a piece of fiction.
A crew of college students are making a documentary film about illegal immigrants from Mexico and with the help of some Mexican friends, travel across the border, interview some common people there and then contract with a coyote to smuggle them across the border along with a busload of Mexican immigrants.  From there, things go downhill.
Their bus is stopped, not by the border patrol but by a violent right-wing group of vigilantes determined to stop the flow of immigrants through terror.  Funny how all the illegal immigrants are such good-looking and naturally friendly people as opposed to sadistic Americans.  Well, a somewhat expected story proceeds: beatings, torture, killings, slavery.  Since there were two quite good-looking women among the lead characters I wondered if they were going to depict a rape, but that is only alluded to.  About halfway through I felt the violence factor outweighed any merits the film might have and I just wanted to get to the end-line: did any of them live?  Escape?  What happens to the vigilantes?  In case someone actually wants to watch this, I won't reveal those major type plot spoilers.  I can say this movie did not revel in graphic blood and dismemberment the way some slasher-horror films do.  It manages to portray the essence of horrible situations without harming any actors.  Nevertheless I cant recommend this film journey.  Its far from a sober documentary on the problem of illegal immigration and as a horror movie well, perhaps its too real for that as well.  Failing to fall soundly in either category it may disappoint fans of both.",1448496000,4,1877,4.964743589743589

8488996,4,B005Y1B3JW,"Good movie. May offend some, but this movie is a work of fiction. I am writing this review to also point out that this movie is NOT a found footage film. This has been the impression of other reviewers, which is incorrect. Without giving the story away, there are may instances where there are no cameras whatsoever (no one is recording the scenes). Ergo, this movie cannot be considered a found footage film, since every part of it is not being recorded. Additionally found footage movies have a disclaimer in the beginning and end about the discovered footage. None exists here. Also the production values of this movie are far better than most found footage films.",1430784000,,667,4.758620689655173

8488999,4,B005Y1B3JW,"This film really surprised me, because I usually hate these found footage films. Aside from the nausea, caused by the constant movement of the camera, I find that these films not only lack a budget, but also a decent story and cast. Undocumented was different though, as it was a novel idea with some fairly stable camera work. The story focuses on a group of college kids, making a documentary about illegal aliens, and how they cross into the United States. The group join a coyote for a run across the boarder when they are unexpectedly capture. Unfortunately for them, their captors aren't the police, but rather a group of self-proclaimed patriots, who abuse the illegal immigrants for their sick pleasure. We see a lot of films about how and why people cross the boarder and even a lot about what the police and government are doing about it, but I can't ever remember seeing a film about these vigilante groups, that do exist, and pray on illegals. Prison Break's Pete Stormare stars as Z, the leader of the rebel group and he basically makes the movie. This guy usually plays a gangster or inmate in the background of some random film or TV show, but he's never really the star, and it's a shame because he makes this movie. Z is such a deep character, who is brilliant yet deranged at the same time, a man who is as compassionate as he is brutal, it was really something to see. He's paired with a young cast of teen actors, who have been around for years, and who do a terrific job in support of his performance. This film isn't listed as a horror film, but it is pretty brutal and bloody, meaning you shouldn't watch it if you have a weak stomach. For me, it was an interesting take on an aspect of immigration that is rarely seen or talked about. The performances were impressive, the characters were deep, and the film never stops moving. I enjoyed the fact that this unique film really didn't have any big named stars in it and even though it had a shoe-string budget, the producers really made it work.",1394928000,2,2017,4.498637602179836
