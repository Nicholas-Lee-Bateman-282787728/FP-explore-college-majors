3936811,5,B002IRYYLO,"This show is alot of silly crossdressing fun.  It is decently clean with no real nudity and no sex scenes, though there was a little gropping of the poor main Characters fake boobs as punishment by his female fellow conspirators at one point. The only downside I found is that it was not considered worthy enough of Dubbing. Too bad realy.",1274659200,,339,4.557377049180328
3936812,5,B002IRYYLO,"I found Otoboku to be a great deal like a stereotypical Japanese woman, but that's not a bad thing. It was charming, and I found myself drawn in to a world very unlike anything I have dealt with. Mizuho is a boy who obediently agrees to go to a school that his Grandfather specified in his will-only to find that it is a conservative, all girl's school! A friend helps him to disguise himself as a beautiful girl who quickly becomes a very popular figure at the school. Mizuho learns many things  about himself, and his family. I love a story that gets me emotionally involved, and this one does. My friends believe it is a bit manipulative-I don't know, I just enjoyed it. I would readily recommend it!",1269734400,3,703,4.449612403100775
3936813,5,B002IRYYLO,"The lead character not only adapts to passing as a girl without a lot of stupidity, but winds up presenting himself as an outstanding manner.  The humor which then surrounds him is is not only excellent, but it is for the most part not at his expense.",1266710400,,251,4.340425531914893
8371094,5,B002IRYYLO,"I bought this series on a whim because at the time of my purchase it was less than 8 dollars so I figured ""what the hell"" and got it. Needless to say this exceed my expectations. It was actually entertaining from start to finish and was only disappointed when the show was over because I feel that a second season is justified. If you are looking for a funny anime about a dude who looks like a lady and all the shenanigans then you really cannot do wrong here haha.",1518566400,,466,4.188888888888889
8371095,5,B002IRYYLO,this anime i have watched in the past and this is the first time i have it on DVD i Highly recommend it for any anime fan who loves Yuri anime and the school in this anime is a catholic all girls school where the main character Mizuho attends incognito with the help of a friend named Mariya who helps him with his transformation from a guy to a legitimate girl,1424736000,,361,4.098591549295775

8371098,4,B002IRYYLO,"I like it well enough to re-get it.

See? I got the classic collection at a time when it was cheaper, and it turned out to be a bootleg that had a broken disk three. I'm scared to re-buy it unless someone comments and tells me that this is the real deal that actually has colored disks, isn't broken, and is worh it.",1413849600,,316,4.015873015873016
8371099,5,B002IRYYLO,spoiler alert. it is a real cute harem series with a boy dressing as a girl because his grandfather had it in his will. it has some of the usual situations that can happen due to him pretending to be a her but most of the stories are a real slice of life. there are some sad ones and funny. if you want just a real nice anime to watch this is it.,1370822400,,346,3.7534246575342465
8371100,5,B002IRYYLO,"I watched this online about 10 times and told myself I had to get this on DVD. If you like Anime with the setting taking place at an all girls school and a boy who 100% looks like a girl forced to attend an all girls school this is something you don't want to pass up. The story is short only 12 episodes the 13th episode is an OVA witch makes it a 13 episode sieries but has nothing to do with the actuall show its self. If you have seen lots of OVA's before you know what I mean. After getting the DVD I have watched about 20 more times.

The only down side is you have to go to set up every time to watch it in English sub if you don't it only plays in Japaness. I know sucks right :( but thats the only flaw in it. It was made for anly Japan not for us Amaricans.",1364256000,4,767,3.7639751552795033
8371101,5,B002IRYYLO,"best show i like the story

8371102,5,B002IRYYLO,"When Mizuho's grandfather passes on, he has one request. He wishes his grand child to go to the same school as Mizuho's mother did.  The problem is not that it is an all girls school, the problem is that Mizuho is a HE.  In order to pass as a girl, his childhood friend Mariya works some makeup magic and gives him the ultimate makeover.  He now looks, and mostly acts, like a girl.  With the help of the school headmaster (who was a friend of his mother) and his homeroom teacher he enters the school, and when he gets there he totally convinces all the other ladies he is like them.  But one student discovers his secret and actually helps them in pulling this off, helping with his ettiquite and manners.  But when he gets nominated to become the ""Big Sister"" of the entire school, the student body president takes notice and tries to convince the student body to turn against ""her"".  Can Mizuho pull off this masquerade long enough to graduate, or will the student body president (who is from a rival family) find out and expose her as the fake he is.

i loved this series.  I watched it when they were 3 disks, and still have them.  Watching Mizuho's actions through the school year and those who support him/her are actually funny, especially the first time he is in gym class and when it is discovered the room he lives in has a cute ghost girl.  It is in japanese, with subtitles, but they do not distract from a good story.  a must have.",1312243200,10,1446,4.3745318352059925
8371103,4,B002IRYYLO,"From the title of this review it should be obvious this is a subtitle only version. An annoying quirk is that it also defaults to Japanese w/out subtitles, so you have to go through set-up each disc. That being said, this is probably one of the best romantic comedy animes I've seen. I try not to give the plot-line in reviews, you can read that on the product listing. Instead, I give my impression, and this series impressed me. Good animation, well paced, and managed to combine romance, comedy, an apparently ridiculous story line, and even a little ghost into a well written story and make it seem normal as everyday life. The one point I'm not sure I liked was the final episode. It does wrap up the series, but in a round about way using a chibi style version of Cinderella (Tsunderella) that is, at least, an interesting take on the story. I won't say anymore so as not to ruin the ending. It was pretty good, but I prefer the ending to be in the setting the series is in, just my personal opinion, so don't let it sway your choice. As I said, this is one of the best anime of it's type I have seen, and i like the type. I just hope a dubbed version is in the future.",1275782400,4,1175,4.226666666666667
