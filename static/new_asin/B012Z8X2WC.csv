8726813,5,B012Z8X2WC,"A great couple of shows (a bit of dark humor, when Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner guest, it is being run by a boat dealership and they first thing they do is get on a boat.)  In the second show, Annette Funicello was the guest and did a couple of songs  Also, Bing Crosby was a uncredited guest on the first show and he and Bob Hope did a song.",1467244800,3,344,3.9
8726814,5,B012Z8X2WC,"The 5 star review is for the shows themselves, not for the dvd release. I would rate the dvd at 3 stars. The picture is poor, but the episodes seem to be full length at 52 and 59 minutes. What prompted me to get this is that Annette Funicello is on the second episode. She sings The Clyde and Jamaica Ska. Bob Hope and the rest of the performers are great too !",1449014400,3,361,3.958904109589041
