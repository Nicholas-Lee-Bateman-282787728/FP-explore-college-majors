8303655,5,B001G2GCTE,"So, yes it is true, it is not as good as the first, but still nice to revisit with all of the old actors. If you haven't seen it, you should, just because it is the sequel. However, nothing beats the first one. It is a classic!",1418342400,,227,3.851063829787234

8303657,4,B001G2GCTE,"""The Irony of Fate 2"" is a sequel (mostly a remake) of the Soviet-era (1975) made-for television film ""The Irony of Fate."" Both films are romantic comedies (of a sort). While the original film gives us a snapshot of life in the former Soviet Union, the newer film provides a snapshot some 30 years later in the ""New Russia.""

To follow and appreciate ""The Irony of Fate 2"" you must watch the original ""Irony of Fate"" first, since the sequel assumes the audience is intimately familiar with the events of the original film. The main actors from original film (Barbara Brylska, Andrey Myagkov, Yuriy Yakovlev, Aleksandr Shirvindt) also star in this sequel (as their original characters some 30 years later). The two principle actors in ""The Irony of Fate 2"" (Konstantin Khabenskiy and Elizaveta Boyarskaya) also recently starred together in the film ""Admiral."" Of course, Konstantin Khabenskiy also starred in the sensational ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch.""

""The Irony of Fate"" was very popular in the Soviet Union. It is certainly better than the remake/sequel. Even so, prior to the release of ""Avatar,"" ""The Irony of Fate 2"" was the most commercially successful film to be shown in Russian. So the newer film is, obviously, very good also.

The subtitles in English are excellent (with just a few typographical errors here and there).",1274572800,4,1335,4.977578475336323
