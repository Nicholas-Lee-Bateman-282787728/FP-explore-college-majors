2698826,4,B000KX0IO0,"I may not be ready to retire, nor do I plan to do so in Florida, but the movie's sweetness, honesty, and genuine situations are those I""m sure I'll be reintroduced to wherever I end up. If you've ever been to Boynton Beach, or any retirement community nearby, you'll agree that the movie characters are caricatures of themselves...and exactly what you'll see....facelift city (the state's motto will soon be ""State of Perpetual Surprise""), glitz, gab, diamonds and baubles. Most true to real life are the friendships and personal lives of the lonely widows/widowers, kept busy with classes and activities, new and old friends/..like a daycamp. I laughed and cried. Excellent writing, superb directing, and just pure fun.",1167955200,13,720,5.162393162393163
2698827,4,B000KX0IO0,A fun movie whose serious side reflects many of the struggles that people of all ages have about dating but with  particular poignant emphasis on seniors.,1167696000,7,154,4.923076923076923
2698828,5,B000KX0IO0,"Boynton Beach Club is what great movies are all about: entertaining and (very) funny, yet insightful and serious when appropriate, and with characters you get to know and love. The movie's cast of seasoned and excellent actors and the compelling storylines make this movie appealing to people of all ages. Enjoy!",1167696000,11,312,5.137254901960785
2698829,5,B000KX0IO0,"A must-see for baby boomers AND their children. Topics are presented that have never been discussed in a movie before -- the things you never say but happen anyway. A serious topic, which isn't taken too seriously. For many people, the ones to whom I've talked, this movie speaks for them and the things they were afraid to say out loud. See it!",1167696000,4,345,4.492063492063492
2698830,5,B000KX0IO0,"This movie is a direct hit into the dating scene for those over 60-- heck for those over 40 even.  Getting back into the social scene as a single is difficult. We all crave companionship, be it a lunch or dinner/breakfast.

This is a sure fire light comedy. Therea re serious issues being developed ( telling adult children you are dating, etc) but the underlying humor keeps it from dragging.

The interactions between the cast resulted in my feeling I was there, with them, going through the processes of healing and reinventing oneself.

Married or single (newly or longtime) can relate to the subject and enjoy watching the stories unfold

Knowing the Boynton BEach area and having friends and family added the personal touch for me as well.

I would recommend this for anyone who is seeking a feel good movie for home or to present as a gift to someone who is starting out on the social scene.",1165881600,9,898,4.616352201257862

2698835,5,B000KX0IO0,Boynton Beach Club  was released in 2005. It starred Brenda Vaccaro. A funny touching film  of people in a senior living community. Anyone will like this film ! Fans of Brenda Vaccaro will like this the most.,1502755200,,208,4.594594594594595
2698836,5,B000KX0IO0,"This was real life and acted just like people act.  It was enjoyale all the way through.  People's feelings were open as well as insane.  Just like the people we meet every day.  Some mature, some just idiots.  I love movies like this.  You really didn't know what was going to happen in each life either.

2698838,4,B000KX0IO0,"This is a very cute, feel-good movie. It's not life-altering or cinematic excellence. It is a movie about ageing and facing the challenges that come in your relationships when you are old. The actors are delightful and endearing.",1500768000,,229,5.052631578947368
2698839,4,B000KX0IO0,"I loved this movie!  It was fun, witty and uplifting.  The basic plot of the movie is people coming together after the loss of their loved ones.  It thought it was done nicely in the sense it wasn't focused on  ""death"" but more on life after death of a loved one...it was a movie about NOT falling in to a deep dark depression...I found it very uplifting.

This movie will not be for everyone...if you typically don't like movies with an ""older"" cast...this won't be for you.  The movie had a lot of well known actors and actresses from ""back in the day""...

I thought the script could have used some work...but the acting was good.

Not a movie I'd pick to watch twice...but for a nice relaxing to watch on a lazy afternoon or quiet evening at home, I'd suggest giving a watch.",1499472000,3,778,4.354166666666667
2698840,4,B000KX0IO0,"funny romantic comedy.  Put off by the 1950s fraud song ""Love and Marriage"" which not only don't ""go together like a horse and carriage"" but in fact are diametric opposites with ""marriage"" being nothing but a prelude for felony theft divorce racketeering in the vast majority of cases.  But there weren't any mirages perpetrated in the actual film only the attempts of the characters to continue living in advanced years.  Plausibly acted with good photography and production.",1499299200,,476,5.1558441558441555

I hope I look half as good as she does and her sparking personality always shines through. If you can't say anything nice, don't say it at all. No benefit comes from comments like those I read.

2698847,5,B000KX0IO0,"Old flames and suave faces come alive in this retirement senior community environment. I mean, hey! Seniors are not all wallowing and waiting to die you know!? Quality of life, at any stage, in any form is what we make of it. And this flick certainly portrays the comedy, the pain, and the joys of being an adult senior in a rather idyllic setting. Having visited several mega-senior communities in various sunny locations, there are definitely advantages to living in one of these. You could never claim to be alone in such a place. There is always so much going on, and camaraderie, so what could go wrong?
Well, the money doth flow amidst the pensioners and financially secure in this place called, Boynton Beach. Love, lust, skullduggery, and compassion never ceases to coexist, even in paradise! Boynton Beach Club is a great romp for all of us who've gone to pasture!",1491436800,,873,4.75

2699064,4,B000KX0IO0,"The audience for this film may be people over sixty, but its message has appeal for anyone over twenty.
Set in a retirement community in Florida, the characters humorously reflect what it's like to be retired
and find meaning and fulfillment in the ""golden years.""  The acting, especially by the women, is terrific.
And the guys are charming, and try their best to overcome their fears and limitations.
This is definitely an entertaining film about a part of our lives that most of us try not to think about

2699065,2,B000KX0IO0,"Is the Boynton Beach Club really the way people my age in Florida retirement communities live? Ironically, my siblings live in just such a community, but I've never been to visit. I never had much in common with my sister, 3 years older, or my brother, 5 years younger, and this movie was in some ways illuminating. It presents people of 60-plus as boring, un-adventurous, inexperienced, and clueless. What were they doing with their lives up until now that taught them so little? Were they just keeping house and mowing the lawn? By the tidy appearance of the community it's clear they're well versed in that department! But as far as real life....A 62-year old man is shocked by a woman's vibrator collection. Men don't know how to cook, and women don't know how to balance checkbooks. The only music these people, who lived through the 60s, seem to listen to is doo-wop and Dean Martin. In fact, they have more in common with my parents' generation than with mine. I couldn't help judging them, yet I also felt isolated and depressed--until it dawned on me that I felt just as isolated and depressed back in the day. Nothing's changed.

Except for this: I've managed, over the years, to find more people like me, people too busy fighting the good fight or making art or changing their little corners of the world to be doing the kind of empty, structured socializing they do in places like Boynton Beach. So I don't feel quite so isolated and freakish anymore....just enough so I can hold my head high, and be glad I don't live there.",1334275200,,1537,4.6300366300366305

I'm a lifelong Dyan Cannon fan, but it's full of other wonderful stars. Boynton Beach Club is sad, funny, and hopeful. I don't think you have to be a Baby Boomer to enjoy it, if you're truthful enough with yourself to accept that many of us will be facing loneliness in the latter years, and yes, we all will grow old.....if we're lucky enough to live that long.

There is a gentle, loping quality to this seriocomic 2006 character-driven comedy, but it also doesn't feel quite substantial enough to provide genuine insight into their difficult situations. The various storylines rarely feel more complex than an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B000KGGIL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls</a>, but the principal actors - some rarely seen outside of guest appearances on reruns of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-She-Wrote/dp/B0011UF79M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder, She Wrote</a>&nbsp;- compensate to a great degree.

There are three plot threads that intertwine over the course of the movie. Long-married Marilyn faces an unexpected tragedy when her exercise-obsessed husband is killed by a thoughtless woman backing her car out of a driveway. She decides to join the Boynton Beach Bereavement Club (the movie's original title) upon the prodding of Lois, a still-sexy, flirtatious interior decorator who is the unofficial social leader of the club. As Marilyn faces her anger and loneliness, Lois finds herself drawn to Donald, a younger man whom she believes is a real estate tycoon. Also in the club is Harry, who fancies himself a ladies' man and wants to help Jack, newly widowed and prime bait for the widows in the retirement community. Jack isn't ready to date until he meets Sandy, a very interested woman who isn't quite what she claims. Harry, on the other hand, tries online dating, but he finds trouble with the woman who seems like the ideal match for him.

It's nice to see actors who gained prominence in the late 1960's and early 1970's receive substantive roles in their autumnal years. Brenda Vaccaro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Cowboy/dp/B000CRQX3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Cowboy</a>) as Marilyn and Len Cariou (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Four-Seasons/dp/B0007QJ1XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Four Seasons</a>) as Jack deliver the strongest performances because their characters undergo the grief and recovery of losing a loved one. Vaccaro has two particularly compelling scenes - the first where Marilyn introduces herself to the club and cannot conceal the rage over her husband's death, the second when Marilyn finally faces the woman who ran her husband over. Dyan Cannon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-and-Carol-and-Ted-and-Alice/dp/B00030GPWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice</a>) as Lois and Joseph Bologna as Harry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Favorite-Year/dp/B0000648ZX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Favorite Year</a>) primarily provide comic relief. Both are as likeable as ever, though it's rather disheartening to see Cannon so surgically altered. The same is true of Sally Kellerman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H/dp/B0002B15XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H</a>) who has to play the concealed Sandy close to the vest. As Donald, Michael Nouri (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flashdance/dp/B000RZIGSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flashdance</a>) plays a character with secrets of his own as he pursues Lois.

2699091,5,B000KX0IO0,"An easy to watch wonderful movie about mature people going back out to find a partner after a loss.  Len Cariou brings masterful dignity to his role as a new widower whom we watch grow steadier as the film progresses.  Joe Bologna is brilliant, with his comic timing, his warmth and heart clearly visible in the delightful Harry.  Brenda Vaccaro  gives an Academy Award quality performance of a justifiably angry woman who pushes herself to reclaim life after losing her husband. It's a treat to see Dyan Cannon with all her coiled energy light up the screen with superb acting, Sally Kellerman still has Hot Lips that are sweetened by her dignified performance as a shy and fiery divorcee, and cameos by Mal Z. Lawrence and Renee Taylor are split second down to the last dot perfect.

That this film has not seen greater success is a mystery. It's timely, smart, witty, at times hilarious, it touches hearts, it has a great cast of seasoned likeable credible actors whose synergy one feels through the screen.",1203292800,2,1010,4.748571428571428

I thought it was very funny and yet it had some things to ponder. One character who was widowed was visited by his granddaughter who found her deceased grandmother's diary. As she read it and told her grandpa, who did not know his wife of 45 years kept a diary,  what it said he discovered a side of his wife that he never knew.

2699108,3,B000KX0IO0,"As a resident of Florida, I was curious about ""Boynton Beach Club"". It's fun to watch, as long as you can distance yourself and not take any of it seriously. The 'story' revolves around people in their senior years who try to form new relationships, often based on lies and deceit. Many of them are as shallow as a puddle, and not very dignified. I have a better relationship with my cat. But I enjoyed the ensemble cast, especially the original ""Sweeney Todd"" - the wonderful Len Cariou.

But truthfully, the best thing about viewing such a movie is being able to read others' comments afterward. And I would welcome answers to the immortal question: Why are people who enjoy Early Bird Specials such a target for ridicule? I've always hated big meals late at night, and I'm not even old enough to live in a so-called ""retirement community"".",1174780800,5,842,4.651006711409396

Affluent Florida retirees cope with isolation and bereavement by forging human connections, often reverting to the sex-obsessed years and patterns of junior high.

Be forewarned, ""Boynton Beach Club"" isn't geared for anyone under the age of 50 years old!

The plot grieving widows and widowers in a support group trying to adjust to life without their partners. Len Cariou plays a new widower. What gets me is new people come into his life but what about the old ones. Surely, neighbors, and friends would be around. Sally Kellerman hot on his trail. Why? He is boring. Yet she pursues him with a vengeance. Dyan Cannon is likeable yet he plastic surgery is distracting from her talent. She is the ingenue of the group. The men are portrayed as older versions of high school guys on the make. These guys unable to do anything about housework. Really? Women unable to balance checkbooks? I suppose this could be true of that generation which confined men and women to certain roles.
