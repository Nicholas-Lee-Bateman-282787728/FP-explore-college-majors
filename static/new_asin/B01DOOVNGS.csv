7719867,4,B01DOOVNGS,"This was an overall fun to watch movie about gaming and gamers. The ending is a bit ""real"", but definitely adds a different twist to this genre of films.",1469664000,,153,4.310344827586207
7719868,5,B01DOOVNGS,"Was expecting cheese, but got a surprisingly good Indie flick.
Kinda' fun, Very tender at times.",1469577600,8,96,5.0625
7719869,4,B01DOOVNGS,"It's ok, cheesy tho",1465516800,,19,4.0
7719870,4,B01DOOVNGS,"Clever, charming, lots of fun. It's a great indie film and I quite enjoyed it. Lots of good dialogue and a well paced story.",1500854400,,124,4.208333333333333
7719871,5,B01DOOVNGS,"Of course the quality of this film is Indie.  It was meant to be.  But the underlying story is anything but.  Geeks also have to deal with real life and this is a very good representation.  Well acted, decently shot and with a very good story.  Heartily recommend.",1500163200,,264,4.416666666666667
7719872,4,B01DOOVNGS,"The budget was low but the message was good.
I enjoyed the characters despite some stock stiffness. This was a fun film that I'm glad I had the chance to watch.",1497830400,2,160,4.193548387096774
7719873,4,B01DOOVNGS,"This movie is unapologetically nerdy at it's core. Just like most other indie films, the dialog and acting are a little unpolished, but I have seen much worse. Overall the movie is a little lame at times, but endearing and true to nerd culture. If you play table top RPGs, have a lot of nerdy friends, or hate the way shows like Big Bang Theory portray nerds, then you should definitely check this out. Even if you don't, it may be worth your time. It's only an hour and some change, so you're not wasting much time even if you hate it.",1497484800,2,536,4.264705882352941
7719874,5,B01DOOVNGS,"This is a delightful movie about roleplayers and the kind of people you generally find within groups. Well meaning, good-hearted people and occasionally someone who can't hold their temper and lash out. I have definitely seen each of these types of people in groups that I've gamed with. One of the things I like most about gaming with people and is shown in this movie, is that people grow. They learn from these games and their actions and they grow as people - from children to adults (and yes I've seen it happen). What more can I say but Kudos to this movie!",1489536000,2,563,4.475728155339806
7719875,4,B01DOOVNGS,"Took awhile to figure out where this was heading, but good acting and a decent story about how friendship and memories are what's most important in life, made this a good movie worth watching. Recommended for pretty much any gamer.",1487548800,,231,4.8
7719876,4,B01DOOVNGS,"Clearly a very low budget film that could have probably done even better with those scenes in which it drifts into the dramatisation elements of the games and the characters the protagonists play; I suspect these alone will put off a great many non-gamers who just don't get it, but this is definitely one for past and present gamers alike. It recognises some of the geeky cliches that have beset gamers forever, but never really succumbs to them, It may laugh at itself in places but it is ultimately a respectful reflection of fantasy gaming, which at least touches upon the reasons why people are drawn into it and find it so enjoyable. As one character says, it is a bit like people who are into watching sports: ""It is pointless, but it matters"".",1486339200,,751,4.611940298507463
7719877,1,B01DOOVNGS,"Awful movie with unlikable people. One of the few movies I've seen in the last year that I couldn't finish. Bad writing, bad acting, just all around poorly done. Since I am a gamer, I'm probably cutting it slack and it's probably worse than I'm making it out to be.",1485820800,,265,4.32
7719878,1,B01DOOVNGS,"Wow, whoever scripted this movie needs a thesaurus. Cursing constantly is not a way to hold a viewers attention nor anybody else out in the world, unless that person is also equally saying as many curse words. In either situation, no communication occurs and all ends in a horrible waste of time which this movie is. I made it a couple of minutes in and felt, like what other reviewers mentioned, awkward and uncomfortable. Maybe if you are drunk, high, or are emotionally manic depressive you will like it.",1485648000,2,507,4.707865168539326
7719879,4,B01DOOVNGS,I liked that the movie touched upon many of the group dynamics the way it did ....Reminded me of the various groups I have encountered over the years.,1484352000,2,150,4.392857142857143
7719880,2,B01DOOVNGS,so the audio is all kinds of messed up. I don't know if it supposed to be like that or not but i can hear music but no voices ? however when i turn subtitles on shows they are speaking,1484006400,,184,3.625
7719881,4,B01DOOVNGS,"Wow.

A fantastic character study, with a very different approach to filmmaking. As others have indicated, the players are archetypes, but without the condescension  that turns so many films' RPG players  into caricatures.",1483920000,,222,5.666666666666667
7719882,1,B01DOOVNGS,Only watched 10 minutes or so.  Uncomfortably vulgar.,1483488000,,53,5.625
7719883,5,B01DOOVNGS,"If you ever played D&D, this movie is a must-see!  OK, so the production values aren't so great, and the audio is a bit wonky, and it takes a while to get going, but man is this a funny movie, and great for anyone who has lived with a D&D'er!  Considering the actors are on their first gig, most likely, they do rather a good job of it!  I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommended!",1482278400,2,420,4.148148148148148
7719884,5,B01DOOVNGS,Funny and unusually heartwarming and heart wrenching at the same time.,1481760000,,70,5.454545454545454
7719885,5,B01DOOVNGS,"It's an indie film about D&D. If the subject and limited polish doesn't keep you from enjoying, then it's great. The casting and acting was solid, and even highly effective where it needed to be. They pulled off the jokes yet it has enough heart you'll care about the people and their friendships. The effects also got the job done. Exactly as cheesy as they should be. I particularly liked the pencil drawings used throughout, which were right on the nose.",1478217600,,457,4.654320987654321
7719886,5,B01DOOVNGS,"The gaming part is just set-dressing. This is a people-story, and a great one.",1476921600,,78,4.642857142857143
7719887,5,B01DOOVNGS,"I gave it a 1 only because the encoding on Prime is messed up.  The audio is choppy and impossible to listen to.  Tried it on a couple devices just to be sure its not my receiver.

Please re-encode this movie and fix the audio and I will try to watch it again.  Maybe rate it a 5.  Who knows

EDIT:  They fixed the audio!  I got to watch it and thought it was great!  A little more profanity than I care for but still, I thought it was good.",1475712000,4,441,3.811111111111111
7719888,5,B01DOOVNGS,"So, I heard of this movie from listening to the RPG Academy podcast when they interviewed the creators. The hosts loved it, so I thought I'd check it out. My main question is...why the hell did this make me so damn teary eyed at the end?  This isn't going to win any awards, but it speaks to the gamer and nongamer alike because this is not about gaming, it's about friends dealing with life and how change affects us all. Great job. I was going to give it 4 stars because all the F bombs... they didn't hold back, because let's face it, we all have that friend....",1475452800,5,565,4.231481481481482
7719889,5,B01DOOVNGS,"This movie was beautiful.  Short as it was, it described many different stylea of gamers,  and showed a philosophy worth embracing.",1475366400,,131,5.190476190476191
7719890,5,B01DOOVNGS,"I started watching this movie expecting the usual jokes about fantasy tropes and observational humor about tabletop gaming.  However, what I found was a surprisingly insightful and poignant story about a group of friends who happen to play role playing games.  It was a far more enjoyable experience than I was expecting.",1475280000,3,321,5.153846153846154
7719891,1,B01DOOVNGS,"Wayyy to much gratuitous cussing for no good reason. I'm okay with appropriate dramatic use of language...but this was not that.  Sorry. Writers or actors improvising should be able to dig deeper than just dropping an f-bomb over and over in the hopes that it conveys anger, or surprise, or disappointment or whatever.",1474588800,,318,5.0
7719892,5,B01DOOVNGS,I have been in many a gaming group that was very close to the characters in this movie. It was very well done and nails the personalities/dynamics that you can get in a group. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.,1473379200,2,208,4.358974358974359
7719893,5,B01DOOVNGS,I supported them on Kickstarter and have watched it at least four times to share it with multiple groups of friends.  So glad it is on Amazon Prime now.,1472774400,,152,4.241379310344827
7719894,4,B01DOOVNGS,"A production very dear to my heart.  A very good representation of the gamers I have known since I introduced my
child to TSR games at the age of 4.  The group dynamics were exaggerated for comic effect but very real &
endearing.  I wish it played a little more smoothly but that may be my internet connection.  I expect to see more
of the writer, director, producer, & actors in the future.  The side arc of dealing with one of the group deciding to
join the military in the aftermath of 9/11 was surprisingly well handled; I like the Schroedinger's Jason line.",1472688000,10,562,4.41747572815534
7719895,5,B01DOOVNGS,The acting is very good.  Producers found some real talent with a very limited budget.,1472688000,3,86,4.733333333333333
7719896,5,B01DOOVNGS,"This is by far the best representation of gamers and gaming I've ever seen -- outside of the gaming table itself, of course! A terrifically funny movie about a bunch of friends who happen to play roleplaying games, Of Dice and Men highlights the relationships between characters, their highs and lows, and the way gaming can bring people together. The jokes do NOT make fun of gamers, which is a nice change of pace, and the characters defy the traditional stereotypes that gamers have had to live with since Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson first unleashed D&D on the world. Worth watching!",1472688000,6,586,4.754901960784314
7719897,5,B01DOOVNGS,For the first ten minutes I was a little unsure if I was going to like this movie. It seemed like it might be just another B rated movie where the sensitive guy bemoans not getting the girl. I'm so glad I stuck with. Kudos to Amazon Prime for picking it The movie is well structured and the dialogue is hilarious. The marriage between Linda and Brandon is a treat. I laughed and cried my way through this movie. Give yourself a chance to do the same.,1471910400,15,450,4.183908045977011
7719898,2,B01DOOVNGS,"It would have been much better if they had stayed in the ""real world"" for the final confrontation, very disappointing.",1471046400,,118,4.95
7719899,5,B01DOOVNGS,"I'd better give it 5 stars, I made the darn thing! :)",1470787200,4,53,3.5
8756534,5,B01DOOVNGS,"Amazing movie, moved to tears by the end, everytime. SO good!",1518566400,,61,4.636363636363637
8756535,4,B01DOOVNGS,"I really can't say how much a non-gamer would apreciate this film, but inspite of it's low budget feel, all my gamer friends were thoroughly entertained. It's as good as ""the Gamers"" films, though with slightly more drama thrown in with all the humor.",1516579200,,251,4.7272727272727275
8756536,5,B01DOOVNGS,"A great story. The directing could have been better, and there are a few places where the story lost focus, but really well done overall.",1511222400,,137,4.52
8756537,5,B01DOOVNGS,"I really did not expect to like this film too much, I always kind of expect to like them slightly, but this film was really heartfelt and honestly felt like it was made by people who get how a gaming group can be a big, at times argumentative, family, and how hard it can be when those dynamics shift and change.",1506297600,3,312,4.131147540983607
8756538,4,B01DOOVNGS,"Normally I hate movies set around gaming, because it's almost always the cringiest thing ever. They did it justice though. This is a dose of some real life drama surrounding a made up game. There's always a prick who swears too much and takes things personal, but you keep him around anyway because he does the most amusing things. There's always at least one girl in the group who everyone likes but probably nobody ever dates because it would mess up the group.

Anyway, ignore the 1 star ratings from Christian grown-up babies with their panties in a twist about swear words. It's a pretty solid movie for what they were working with, and it's largely accurate to real life.",1506038400,2,677,4.641666666666667
8756539,5,B01DOOVNGS,"I have loved this movie for years now. Some reviewers have commented on the language...its definitely not a kids movie even if you have geeky kids, at least not before you are comfortable with them learning new vocabulary words with which to visit the principal. Grown up viewers can count on being highly amused and also maybe sniffling just a little bit.",1505433600,,356,4.758064516129032
8756540,1,B01DOOVNGS,It is unbelievable that this movie has anywhere near the high rating that it does.  The cast must have lots of friends and asked each of them to review it for them.,1505347200,,164,4.125
8756541,5,B01DOOVNGS,"I enjoyed this movie...despite many reviewers tearing it down. The characters are meant to be messengers of the tropes of RPG'ers, which I feel was accomplished quite well. The plot though simple, came across as familiar; and that's what sold me on this movie. As advertised, it's a geek movie without all the self-loathing. Though I found the romantic bits a little stale, at its core it gets the core message across ""There's nothing wrong with playing D&D into adulthood if that's your thing.""",1503878400,,495,4.904761904761905
8756542,5,B01DOOVNGS,"This is a good movie, yes it's low budget, no it doesn't really have an effects, but it has heart. It's about gamers playing their game and living life. It's truth and it's fun, it's funny, and if you game long enough you easily recognize all the characters. If you like gaming watch this and know it wasn't made to poke fun at gaming, gaming just happens to be part of the characters lives.",1503532800,2,391,4.297297297297297
8756543,4,B01DOOVNGS,"Very well done. I enjoyed the story. It takes a little bit to lift off, but once it does, it's a fun ride. If you've ever been part of a D&D or any other RPG group, you'll find friends in the characters. And maybe this will prompt you to get out your dice for one more campaign.",1503100800,3,278,3.8947368421052633
