8636644,1,B00HW2XJVG,I didn't like this performance.  The tempo throughout was rushed.  Yet another example of Bach by a stopwatch.,1448064000,,110,5.055555555555555
8636645,5,B00HW2XJVG,Beautifully sung and played.  Wonderfully recorded.  The camera work is exceptional.  My single greatest classical music purchase.  Worth many times the price.  To be treasured.,1427500800,2,177,5.92
8636646,5,B00HW2XJVG,A very beautifully rendered performance of a true masterwork. The blu ray lends richness to the total prleselntation.,1427068800,,117,5.555555555555555
8636647,5,B00HW2XJVG,Everyone that loves classical music should have this. This is the pinnacle of production values for the very top composition. The dream cast of performers.  Even the Bonus features bring a tear to the eye.  A real Glory to the Lord.,1425600000,2,232,4.634146341463414
8636648,5,B00HW2XJVG,"I can't imagine a better version. I really liked all the singers (soloists and chorus), the orchestra, the presentation in St Denis Cathedral, and the conductor's interpretation. Beautiful. Oh, and Bach's music is outstanding. I'm not religious, but it still moved me.",1416614400,,268,5.404761904761905
8636649,5,B00HW2XJVG,"I may hold some kind of record of owning every single DVD and Blu-Ray available of this piece (St. Matthew Passion) and of Bach's B-minor Mass. Most have their ups and downs, their strong and their weak moments (and the ones from the choir at St. Thomaskirk are particularly uneven) but this performance is a stunner. It's my reference copy for excellence in every respect--the singing performances (the Evangelist, Jesus, the Soprano and Mezzo/Alto are especially strong, but no one is weak), the interpretation, the photography, and (above all, if there were anything to be below it) the sound, the sound, the sound. A 24 bit/48K recording, which is not bad in itself, but it sounds even better than that, it sounds as good as 96K or better, and the microphone placements, the sense of the space and air around the singers or instrumental soloists, is close to perfection. In short: the sweetness, harshness, wonder, beauty, majesty, sadness, tragedy, magic of the great-minded, great-souled Bach is all there. in a crowded DVD and Blu-Ray field, highly recommended. To the glory of God, music, and the human soul.",1416355200,6,1116,4.973262032085562
