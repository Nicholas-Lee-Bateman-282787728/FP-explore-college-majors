8472957,1,B005HFOICY,"I thought the book was okay (it really jumps around and is very shallow) but this DVD makes the book look like a masterpiece. It's obvious by the huge price drop that they weren't selling.

Basically, a camcorder was set up and he talks over slides. You don't see anything you haven't seen before, many times over. It feels like a cheesy library presentation that one would have seen in the 70s. The DVD runs around 70 minutes and the menu was poorly designed. There's an incredibly bad copy of the 50s ""Abominable Snowman"" trailer added and a snippet of some of the authors other videos. He's a modern day ""Indiana Jones""? He looks like he gets winded climbing 10 stairs.

There is nothing here for a serious bigfoot enthusiast and would barely cause a casual fan or novice to look much further. For completionists only.",1495843200,,821,4.616438356164384
8472958,1,B005HFOICY,"Childress does a good job of fleshing out the old adage that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The amount of incorrect information he provides is embarrassing.  From long-questioned photos most bigfoot fans will be familiar with from the internet and other sources to complete mistakes on locations and events long known in the serious bigfoot community, he gets a lot wrong.  (BTW; I live near Myakka, Florida and it's pronounced MY-akka, not ME-akka).  There are several photos in this DVD and it's companion book that make buying either somewhat worthwhile, but mostly this is just someone with a paranormal following (Ancient Aliens) using his celebrity to cash in on the bigfoot craze.  His ""version"" of the Boggy Creek story is ridiculously incorrect - If you have an interest there, go for Lyle Blackburn's thorough and well-researched book on that subject, which is available on Amazon.  If you want to actually learn something about bigfoot and similar creatures, this DVD is not where you want to look.  Sasquatch: The Legend Meets Science; Sasquatch Odyssey; Eyes In The Dark; and Oregon Bigfoot are just some of the well-researched DVD's on this subject available on Amazon.",1446076800,,1197,5.081632653061225
