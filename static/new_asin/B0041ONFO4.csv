4246195,5,B0041ONFO4,"I have watched this movie 3 times and upgraded it to blu ray. It's a great but sad and depressing story. Could not help but feel sorry for Christopher Rocket( Jimmy Fallon) this guy can act. Sharon Stone gave fabulous performance as a hippie mother. I like her philosophy on life, very original. Lucy Liu was great and sexy. Christopher's father (Tom Arnold) gave his performance as a selfish father at his best.
It deserves 5 stars.",1336176000,3,433,4.636363636363637
4246196,4,B0041ONFO4,"This film wasn't released in theatres, but it's loaded with interesting scenes and offbeat performances. It's definitely worth seeing. After all, this is a film where Sharon Stone has the comic lead and Jimmy Fallon has the serious role! There are lots of memorable scenes with a very funny supporting cast, too.",1324425600,3,312,5.019230769230769
4246197,5,B0041ONFO4,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm surprised it wasn't released on DVD sooner.

The characters were all so deeply drawn out, quirky and so very flawed-- almost to where it was tragic. I enjoy movies with dysfunctional and broken families because I know what that's like and frankly, it's nice to see someone worse off than me.

The cast was amazing!! Tom Arnold, Jimmy Fallon, Sharon Stone and Lucy Liu make for a decent ensemble.

And let me reiterate that Fallon is a highly underrated actor and that can play more than just a giggling goofball-- he really can portray a brooding and incredibly broken man. Jimmy Fallon really displayed some of the best acting of his career.",1293667200,8,675,4.703389830508475
4246198,4,B0041ONFO4,"I liked this movie, and give it 4-stars.  My husband said he would only give it 3-stars, but he watched the whole movie with me, which means he thought it was interesting.  Despite the cast, this isn't a comedy, but more of a thoughtful drama.  The acting was great, and I liked the ending.",1292198400,5,290,4.333333333333333

8413089,5,B0041ONFO4,"We were background for this movie several years ago. Jimmy Fallon was an unknown at the time. We were waiting for our que to perform and he walked up to me, introduced himself and we had a very pleasant conversation.  Wish I had known his fame would take off and gotten his autograph. Tom Arnold was in this movie as well and also very pleasant.",1403827200,,345,4.3076923076923075
8413090,5,B0041ONFO4,"This was an interesting movie, nothing that I expected.  I never saw Jimmy play a dramatic role so it was very different. It was a good movie that reflected on dysfunction in the family but also how to get free of issues. Great price, great seller.",1364169600,2,248,4.391304347826087
