7842533,3,6303284264,"i should have known that any ""___ of steel"" production is going to have godawful aerobics, but this dude dancing away to quite possibly the cheesiest music ever.... i had to stop the tape because i was laughing so hard. homeboy looks RIDICULOUS!!
now, once you get to the actual workout, it's decent.
it may seem a bit too easy for women, since this part works on lateral flexibility which seems harder for men. it took me a while to like this tape, i still have to fast forward past the  aerobics section, it's just too funny. i would recommend the warm up from ""crunch-washboard abs"" over the aerobics part of this tape.",1120780800,2,622,4.504424778761062

7842535,5,6303284264,"The approach in this video is intelligent and unique.  Most people think that there is only one way to achieve these types of abs.... the 'no pain no gain' approach.  Scott's approach shows that you don't have to do it that way...if you're in tune with the real nature of your body and how the muscles work and develop, you can achieve great abs.  I loved it!",1002240000,3,359,4.3283582089552235
7842536,2,6303284264,"This might be good for someone who has never worked out but I was very disappointed with it.  Used it once and it will go to the garage now.  This certainly isn't good enough to tone, let alone give you abs of steel. What a joke!",1001808000,3,229,3.9565217391304346
