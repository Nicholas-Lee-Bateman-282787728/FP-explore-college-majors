8055090,4,B00080ZG42,"Commissioned by London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1975, TWO'S COMPANY starred the divine Elaine Stritch as Dorothy McNab, an American mystery novelist living and working in London, who takes on the stuffy, oh-so-teddibly British Robert (Donald Sinden) as her butler. Sparks fly when Dorothy, who is under the false belief that everyone is meant to have equal footing in this life, is ""instructed"" by Robert in the correct way (ie: HIS way) of running a household. Madly bashing away at the typewriter, Dorothy needs an organised and relaxed home life...but she never counted on tightly-wound Robert. Just WHO is the help and who is the boss?!

Wickedly scripted by Bill MacIllwraith, TWO'S COMPANY offered viewers of British comedy something a little more sophisticated and biting than the usual fare, with the humour extending from the dry wordplay between Dorothy and Robert. The show came during one of Elaine Stritch's most prolific periods of her professional career. She had chiefly relocated to London for the successful West End transfer of ""Company"", but decided to stay in the country on a full-time basis when she married English actor John Bay. Setting up housekeeping at the Savoy Hotel no less, Stritch was the darling of the London talk show circuit, starred as Aunt Polly in a miniseries of ""Pollyanna"" for the BBC, and of course remained as the acerbic Dorothy for three more series of TWO'S COMPANY.

Series 3 of TWO'S COMPANY includes the following episodes:

""The Invitation"" - Dorothy's off to have tea with the Queen.  That is, IF she can escape from her wacky dress designer (Rosalind Ayres)...

""The Freezer"" - To Dorothy, a home freezer is a great way to save money on food.  To Robert, it's nothing less than a cardinal sin.  Battle lines are drawn...

""The Pet"" - She's So Darling...  Dorothy wants a dog, but she has to go through Robert first.  Guest starring Beryl Reid.

""The Take-Over Bid"" - Dorothy's new chauffeur and his kitchen-whiz wife (Colin Jeavons and Bridget Turner) poise themselves to usurp Robert's place...

""The Virus"" - As Dorothy is knocked out with a minor bug, Robert decides to milk the situation in his own favour by convieniently falling ill as well...

""The Critic"" - Dorothy's work is slammed in the public press by an anonymous new reviewer...

""The Picnic"" - Robert's birthday treat for Dorothy flies out the window when two unexpected friends drop in...

""The Politicians"" - Dorothy's appeal for a special hostel catering to upcoming American authors looks to be scuppered when Robert starts locking horns with one of her would-be supporters...",1277856000,,2604,4.99537037037037
8055091,5,B00080ZG42,"The show brought up the issues that the United States is now grappling with today such as Socialized Medicine, VAT taxes, and the cost of living.  It teaches us with humor and the show has characters that are likable to most.  Also, I love the tv shows song prior to the beginning of the show(my roommate hates it)since it tells their constant struggles to win the argument.  In the end, they're the best of friends no matter how much they disagree with each other.  This British tv series is a gem among many comedies that I've watched over the years!  A must have for all fans!",1271980800,,579,4.4245283018867925
8055092,5,B00080ZG42,"Although one has to have a taste for Elaine's straight-forward humor, this dvd set, the third in the series, has some truly funny moments. I wish someone would release ""Open All Hours"" on dvd, one of Britain's best comedies.",1122854400,2,224,4.769230769230769
