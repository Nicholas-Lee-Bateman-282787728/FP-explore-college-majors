5730707,2,B00CMQX84A,"Very talented cast and beautiful beaches, a few really cute songs. But the story soon drags and loses energy. The girl power feminism stuff was not well thought out. I'm all for girl power but the way they represented 1960s era teens as all wrong about dating and modern teens as all progressive and right was just stupid. One odd thing I'm noticing about modern feminism is how far off and out of touch it is from the recent past. It's getting to the point where if you listen to the feminists long enough you'll get an idea the 1960s was as backward as the early 19th century and the 1990s were a million years ago and did not promote strong women.
Just inaccurate and annoying.",1492560000,,680,4.404761904761905

5730709,5,B00CMQX84A,"I grew up watching all the beach movies with Frankie A. and Annett F. I have all these movies now on DVD to watch whenever. I was not sure at first about this Teen Beach Movie, because I really didn't know any of the actors and thought it might be a rip off or making fun of the older beach movies. I was very pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the movie, the singing, dancing and the cast. If you enjoy the older beach movies, you might enjoy seeing this movie and it brings back memories of the older beach goers and their antics. I am sure they will have more of these Teen Beach Movies as they did with the older beach movies,",1490054400,,628,4.155737704918033

5730744,5,B00CMQX84A,"I LOVE the Teen Beach Movie! I'm an adult female and I think that this movie has some amazing lessons in it for childeren and adults alike. Not only does it teach children that girls can do anything boys can do, but it does so through some very catchy songs and dance that parody the cheesy beach movies of Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello of the 1960s, while also showing how they had some sexist tendancies because of the time, and correcting those flaws and showing that it's important to stand up for what's right and not just give in to peer pressure.
This movie also has a heartwarming message about being yourself and following your heart. It's message is that you shouldn't simply do things that people tell you because they say you should do it, but you should do what makes you happy and never try to be something that you're not.
All in all, I love this movie, and my 2 and 4 year old cousins absolutely LOVE this movie. I hope that children everywhere can learn something from this powerful movie hidden behind catchy songs and 1960s parody comedy.",1468886400,,1064,4.518134715025907

She only knows them because these two movies are are high on her nearly 40 year old mother's list of favorite movies. I haven't bought them yet but the time is coming soon where they will both be in my collection and because she loves the songs, I can justify watching them over and over again. Yay for obsessive toddlers! If you enjoy upbeat musicals this is for you. If you enjoy light hearted movies, this is also for you. If your taste in movies stinks, watch this and learn what fun movies are. Nothing bad to say except the ending of this one does not match exactly what happens in the next but that is easily overlooked as you sing along to the catchy songs.

5730841,4,B00CMQX84A,"I don't follow the Disney Channel as closely as I should.  As a result, I almost missed their recent original movie Teen Beach Movie.  But the chatter I heard made me curious enough I had to give it a try.  Im glad I did since I wound up really enjoying it.

Mack (Maia Mitchell) and Brady (Ross Lynch) are enjoying a perfect summer living near the beach and surfing every day.  All that comes to a dramatic end when Macks aunt Annette shows up to take her to an exclusive boarding school for her final two years of high school.  With the schooling and connections shell make there, shell be set to move on to a top college and become a huge success in her adult life.  Brady, naturally, doesnt like the fact that this pretty much means theyll be breaking up.

The morning that Mack is supposed to leave has record setting surf, and she cant resist catching the huge waves.  But the next thing she and Brady know, they are transported tosomewhere else.

Brady quickly recognizes it as the 60s beach movie Wet Side Story, a story about surfers and bikers fighting over a hang out spot.  Hes delighted since it is his favorite movie, but Mack is less than thrilled.  When the two accidentally interrupt the plot of the movie, they realize they have three days to get the plot back on track so they can get home.  Will they be able to do it?

Ive only ever seen one of the famous beach movies.  Frankly, I thought it was rather cheesy and over the top.  In fact, early on Mack makes a list of all that is wrong with the genre, and I was nodding my head in agreement.  Well, okay, except for the part about people breaking out into random songs since I do love musicals, and that is a feature of the genre.  Anyway, Im not the biggest fan of the genre, which worried me a little going into an homage/spoof.

And the difference between the real world and the 60s world of the movie is apparent early on.  The acting was good in the real world, good enough to make me feel sorry for Brady.  But when they arrived in the movie, it was over the top cheese.  Yes, I know it was on purpose and all the actors being it were perfect at capturing the style of acting from those films.  But it took me a little while to get into the film as a result.

But somewhere along the way, I began to enjoy it.  Yes, the movie is predictable.  Yes, the acting stayed cheesy.  But I found myself caring about the outcome of the characters from our world and the characters of the movie.  And since Brady and Mack know they are in the film, the self aware references cracked me up.  The songs and choreography are fun.  They feel like modern versions of the 60s song styles of the films being spoofed.

When I was officially sold on the film was when it hit the song Can't Stop Singing.  Its a duet between Brady and Mack that horrifies Mack since she is breaking out into random song for no reason.  I was dying.

The film has a few plot holes, like characters suddenly knowing plot points they have no way to have learned.  By the time it happened, I didn't care.  I was having fun.  There is another hole as well, but it didn't matter much.

Along the way, Mack is trying to educate the girls in the film that there is more to life than boys, girls can do anything they want, and to do things they enjoy.  The difference between our culture today and the culture of the movies they are spoofing is noticeable.  However, Mack realizes she needs the lesson herself by the end in a moment I loved.

Disney is hoping to recapture the magic in a bottle that was the High School Musical franchise.  I don't know if theyve quite done that, but they certainly have an entertaining movie with Teen Beach Movie.  Its not great cinema, but if you watch it expecting something along the lines of the beach movies from the 60s, youll be very entertained.",1433808000,,3819,4.2899159663865545

The plot was interesting and weird, but it works. I actually wish the movie had been a bit longer but I understand they need to keep it at 90 minutes. The only weak point was the whole plot with the weather machine because they kind of glossed over the villains and the climatic scene just happened out of nowhere without much exposition. The music and dance numbers were pretty cool, though. Great for kids and non cynical adults to watch. Can't wait for Teen Beach 2!",1432425600,,638,4.415254237288136

It doesn't have the great dance routines that High School Musical had, in fact they are at times a bit lame, and the main characters do not have the same draw. You don't feel invested in them; also end, up-in-the air. But, there is something about this Movie that draws you back to the old beach movies(which I think was the direction the director wanted to go). It does that(though you'd actually have to get the original beach movies to enjoy the qualities of them) . The storyline and some of the characters are cartoonish. But, if you're looking for a clean, light story; this is the movie to see. Get it at the lowest price you can though. It's not worth a lot of money, but its enjoyable and it is the type of movie you might want to watch again. The messages are also good: Acceptance, Look for YOUR path, not someone elses, etc...",1406073600,3,868,4.364197530864198

5730910,3,B00CMQX84A,"Disney is excellent at keeping women and girls from becoming erotic objects. I appreciate this about their company and this is why I do not go lower in my rating of this movie.
The plot is ridiculous. A young woman is told that she will be leaving in a VERY short time for a boarding school by a wealthy and eccentric relative. She has a boyfriend and is torn as to whether she wants to leave. I do not know what happens in the end as my brain screams that it is going to shut down after the third song and dance routine.
The men and women dress well and the music and singing is professional grade as per Disney's usual standard.
However the disfunctional relationship between the young woman and her relatives is too much for me to ignore. Who tells a teenager who is not addicted to something, and this young woman is not, that they are going away tomorrow to a boarding school? Do healthy families not discuss this and make such transitions work out months in advance?
Your eight-year-old girl may love it. If you are watching it with her, turn your brain off in advance or it will let you know about it.",1405209600,,1108,4.331730769230769

Its your parental responsibility to raise your children properly, not the governments, Big Business, and especially Hollywood.  So before I go off on that tangent.  This Movie makes it easier and is a refreshing change in typical New Disney Movies. Swimsuits are modest, they don't act too much like Brats and don't undermine proper authority figures such as Parents and adults in general.

If you get a chance take a look at the Making of scenes.  Its very impressive how much hard work they put into the choreography.",1387152000,,610,4.883495145631068

We never get tired of this, I love watching her stand in front of the tv to do the dances they do and to sing the music. It was a cute family movie or kid movie.  I'm sure Austin and Ally fans would love this if they are Ross Lynch fans. I love that it has a lot of songs and dancing in it because it gets her off the couch and up and moving.

I loved Ross although the tap dancing scene was well ouch to his acting.... OH and the ACTING are they acting or are they really that stupid back in the 60's???? Tanner was handsome but wow all beauty no brains and Maia was a super bad actor I well never buy any more movies with her in it that is for sure... though I would buy a cd from her she has a beautifull voice but baddddddddddd actor!!!! I bought this movie because although it was really bad it made me laugh at how dumb they played their parts the only believable actors was Ross and one of the suffers SeaCat really liked him he was so real....anyways my advise if you are just a ross fan or love to laugh because its so stupid get it like I did but if ""acting"" stupid is not your things and you want to watch a believable movie then this isn't for you ""Your pretty smart"" says Maia to Tanner he replies ""yeah but more pretty!"" =0 wow so dumb and there are a lot of this going on in this Disney movie Don't get me wrong I bought it after waiting two and a half months on Disney I bought it anyways but that is because Im a die Hard Ross Lynch Fan!!!",1385856000,,1225,4.045267489711934

Ross Lynch, Maia Mitchell and cast are wonderfully cast. I would hate to see a remake. Wet Side Story ..so fun, the movie has overtones of many of those born prior to 1970 - so it's nostalgic on some levels for the mature viewer. My childern love the songs, the dance and the story.
In several words: FUN, entertaining, exciting, engaging! - appropriate for all ages 5 - 105!
Like all great musicals: you will find yourself singing along, humming the tunes and just glad you had the opportunity to be part of the magic of the movies.",1380499200,,659,4.365853658536586

5731039,5,B00CMQX84A,"Teen Beach Movie is a breakout part for Ross Lynch of 'Austin & Ally Fame'. Ross is a natural casting for this role, as Ross is the mirror reflection of surfboards and musical numbers. With college level acting training, Lynch has the potential to be an actor on an extremely high level. Remember though Elvis Presley did not have formal acting training when he did all of those beach movies and other movies in the 1960's. Lynch is extraordinarily liked by young people, though not loved to the extent David Cassidy triggered teen idolatry.

Lynch is cast as the teen beach love interest of Maia Mitchell. The additional rehearsal footage of the musical numbers which comes with the DVD shows the musically talented Lynch to be a relaxed performer, while the musically talented Mitchell appeared tense and not so thrilled to be working with Lynch.

The Teen Beach Movie comes off like a teeny bopper version of Grease crossed with West Side Story given a modern cable television treatment. The choreography is spectacular to perfection, the music numbers divine. Broadway actor Kevin Chamberlain of 'Jessie' fame is again typecast in a silly role. Truth is Chamberlain has the potential to be a box office movie star if given the correct role, but he is being stereotyped worse than Jonathan Harris on 'Lost in Space' or Paul Lynde in the center square of 'Holylwood Squares'. Chamberlain's appearance is sparingly, though. He does not distract from the main characters or the movie plot.

The main criticism here is not with Disney. This is a fantastic movie for young people and absolutely clean. The main issue is whether Ross Lynch wants to continue protecting a an image which is too clean. He does not kiss Mitchell with any love intentions during the entire movie, and Disney needed to accomplish this for maximum effect. However, conversely, Miley Cyrus PR team has has her image publicly trashed in overexposure to the extent nobody wants to see her image anymore. Ross needs to be able to kiss a girl, be more of an action actor, if he wants to break out of the teen mold. One noticeable point is Maia Mitchell is so totally beautiful opposite Lynch, it becomes obvious to the movie viewer that Laura Marano, Lynch's co-star in Austin & Ally, is a talented actress but extremely homely. Why Disney Studios would do Teen Beach Movie to such complexity and not have Lynch and Mitchell do more than embrace is a mystery, but the net effect of it is the movie will not reach prime time but is doomed to Disney channel and download because it is not romantically bold enough to become a mainstream crossover work. All being said, it is an excellent kids movie nonetheless and a musical achievement for Disney, who hopefully will transition Lynch to the movie big screen leap beyond television, where Marano is trapped.",1380326400,,2824,4.806584362139918

5731069,5,B00CMQX84A,"The Teen Beach Movie is a Disney DVD of the Disney Channel original movie that is a fitting tribute to the classic 1960's beach movies. Starring Ross Lynch, Maia Mitchell and Barry Bostwick, the movie tells the story of two friends Brady(Lynch)and Mack(Mitchell) having a great time at the beach and surfing when a out of control wave transports them to a 1962-set beach comedy movie Wet Side Story, where they are met with the characters from the movie. Now Brady and Mack must find a way to correct the film and return back to 2013 before it is too late. The opening credits of the film has a dedication to the late Annette Funicello, which I thought it was touching. The special features includes behind the scenes look of the dance sequences and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favorites like the Muppet Movie Anniversary Editon, The Little Mermaid, Return To Neverland and Super Buddies. The Teen Beach Movie is perfect for fans of 1960's beach movies!",1378166400,,957,4.7023809523809526
5731070,4,B00CMQX84A,"When I originally watched the movie and noticed it was a musical I almost turned it off, but I kept watching.  Another point that almost made me turn it off was it was basically about two characters dating in the beginning of the film and that doesn't fly with me so I almost turned it off.  But I kept watching and this turned out to be a really good movie.  The music is neat.  As the story goes on it's about a pair of teenagers being stuck in a movie from 1962.  The actors that were in this part did a really great job.  It seemed to really be like a 1960's era movie going by how the girls talked.  I was really surprised by it.  I would recommend it.",1378080000,,657,4.0

The actors are cute and the story is nice.  It is not blockbuster quality, but it makes for a nice summer diversion.  She took it with her when babysitting the ten year old crowd a few times.  Those girls were equally in love with the movie.  I would consider it appropriate for probably ten and up.  I am pretty conservative about viewing ages.

5731076,5,B00CMQX84A,"""Teen Beach Movie"" is a brilliant deconstruction of 1960s teenage titles such as ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" and ""Ride the Wild Surf"" with the influence of the stage and screen tributes of ""Grease"" and the time travel antics of ""Back to the Future."" It is also the second highest ranking cable television movie ever, right behind Disney's own ""High School Musical 2."" The trumpeting of the huge number of viewers in the demographic of children age 2 to 11 ignores the fact of how pleasurable the movie is for adults as well, especially those engaged by its self-referential enthusiasm and its film-within-a-film structure, enlivened by a soupon of post-feminist self actualization. This movie truly is fun for the entire family, and reveals additional charms in repeat viewings. The choreography, cinematography, editing and performing of musical numbers such as ""Surf's Up"" and ""Cruisin' for a Bruisin'"" and ""Like Me"" are infectiously entertaining. Particularly noteworthy are the charm and charisma of lead performer Ross Lynch as Brady, a regular on the Disney Channel's ""Austin & Ally"" show, who knows all about those old movie musicals such as ""Wet Side Story"" and figures out how to get back to the future with girlfriend Mack. To fellow surfer Tanner, Brady says: ""So, all you guys do around here is hang, eat and surf?"" and Tanner replies, ""Is there any other way?"" Brady agrees: ""Sounds perfect!"" Totally!",1377820800,,1408,5.0995670995671

5731112,4,B00CMQX84A,"According to the Deadline Hollywood site, Teen Beach Movie is the number 2 most-watched movie in cable TV history, after High School Musical 2. My guess is that, the new film, just released on DVD, has exceeded even Disney Channel's expectations.

While Disney Channel remains a kids' cable powerhouse, its level of huge, phenomenon-generating sensations such as Hannah Montana and High School Musical are several years in the past. The channel has some big hits, particularly Phineas & Ferb, Gravity Falls and Disney Junior shows Sofia the First and Doc McStuffins, but TV viewership has changed dramatically since the last decade. That makes the high viewership of Teen Beach Movie an even more significant success.

So how it make such a (forgive me) splash? I think people of all ages discovered that it was better than they expected, if not better than average for Disney Channel movies of the last few years. It's genuinely funny, colorful escapism, the kind of thing popular in the '60s and other periods in history when the country needed fun, silly stuff to take them away from economic and political issues.

If you liked the Annette & Frankie beach movies, this movie has more than just overt references. The leading lady is going to be sent to ""Dunwich Academy,"" surely a nod to The Dunwich Horror, produced by American-International Pictures, the same low-budget, high-profit studio that made the seven ""official"" beach movies.

The villain, parodying Vincent Price from such fluffy frolics as Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine. Like Price, his British accent is theatrical since this villain is really from Pittsburgh. Vincent Price was really from St. Louis.

At the start of Teen Beach Movie, there's an iconic image for those who knows the original beach party films: a twisting young dancer dressed in frills -- certainly inspired by Candy Johnson, the ""world's fastest twister,"" who danced over the end credits of most AIP beach movies. (I hope that, if there is a sequel, no one second-guesses the inclusion of such nice touches because ""No one will get it.""

Teen Beach Movie is Grease without the viscosity. The humor is more in the farcical style of The Monkees TV series (right down to the Davy Jones-like twinkling eyes). There's virtually no innuendo.

David Lawrence, son of Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, did the score and wrote some of the songs, a task he excelled at for the High School Musical movies. The songs on the soundtrack are a canny blend of '60s styles and contemporary teen pop mixes.

Perhaps more than anything, Teen Beach Musical is a dance film -- more so than High School Musical. Director/choreographer Jeffrey Hornaday vast list of credits includes the Disney Parks attraction, Captain EO. Members of the cast are recognizable from such TV competitions as ""So You Think You Can Dance?"" The bonus rehearsal footage bears out the energetic dance moves as well as the talents of the cast.

Don't expect Teen Beach Movie to be Jean-Luc Godard or Orson Welles. Just find a comfy chair and let it take you out on the surf. Even though the surf looks deliberately like it's been filmed against a green screen and no one's hair gets wet.",1376006400,3,3182,4.910614525139665

5731124,3,B00CMQX84A,"I haven't seen a Disney movie in quite some time (Pixar doesn't count) and the old beach movies of the 60s were fun. I thought I'd get a kick out of Teen Beach Movie; especially since it is spoofing those movies. Female teen surfer, McKenzie (Mack) and her boyfriend Brady (who is a big fan of the 60's beach film ""Wet Side Story"" are transported to said movie while riding the `big' wave and with the help of a special surfboard. Due to their interference, they change the storyline of the movie and might not be able to get back to their own world and time.

I love spoofs and enjoyed this more than I should. It bikers vs. surfers over who gets to hang out at the local hangout and the film leads fall in love with the transported teens. There is also a crazy scientist bent on taking over the whole beach. Yes, there is overacting, and some silly songs, but overall I found it to be good family fun. It even got a chuckle or two from my wife.

Would I watch it again? Probably not. Nor would I see a sequel or buy the soundtrack. I think it would be difficult for Disney to franchise this, although I could see them making as play out of it.",1375401600,,1145,4.176470588235294
5731125,4,B00CMQX84A,"I have to admit I don't see much in the teen genre area so I was curious to see what today's teens are like in Disney's Teen Beach Movie.

I was really impressed with both the acting and singing skills of Lynch and Mitchell. Both were adorable, enthusiastic and completely convincing in their respective roles. An adorable couple, they may be forced apart when McKenzie is set to move away.

I'm not usually a fan of musicals but when done right (as in moderation), it can be fun! The upbeat, catchy tunes of Teen Teach Movie brought my kids in the room and at only three and five, this movie was definitely not for them. But the music was fun enough that it was enjoyable for all ages.

In all honesty, I didn't expect to get caught up in a teen movie but I did! I was anxious to see how it turned out and if Brady and McKenzie would find a way to stay together. Anything with Disney's name on it automatically has high standards for me and this is exactly what I'd expect from a Disney
teen movie.

Teen Beach Movie is a fun summer flick with love, action, comedy and music! And most importantly; it's clean wholesome entertainment for your teen!",1375142400,3,1148,4.350467289719626

5731127,3,B00CMQX84A,"Me and my daughter loved the catchy songs and unexpected flash mobs, but the plot wasn't very good or satisfying. They've made a lot of ""funny"" adjustments to West Side Story, like it's biker's Vs. surfers instead of the two gangs, and there fighting over a hangout called ""Big Mama's"", but the part about the evil scientist creating a weather machine was a little too much. Also, the main part of the original story is supposed to be about Maria and Tony falling in love but no one approves. But in this it's about Mack and Tanner, and Brady and Lela's relationship. Though Mack and Tanner are both surfers, Lela is a biker and Brady is a surfer, it seems that nobody cares about their difference. Actually, in the whole movie, no one even cares what side Mack and Brady are on! The bikers and surfers may talk bad about each other, but they are never trying to pull each other away from their rivals, except maybe a tiny bit in the very end. Also, the whole movie had no twist's or surprises, everything was very predictable. The only part I liked was  after Lela stopped singing ""Falling For Ya"" and the bikers and surfers just stood their, not knowing what to do. They should of made more of these dramatic scenes, but they seemed to have left the idea behind. Besides the unskilled plot, the acting was OK and the makeup and outfit's were colorful and creative. Though the plot wasn't amazing, there was a funny part at the end when the bikers and surfers travel to the real world. When a man asks if they are lost, he shows them his phone with a picture of Justin Beiber as his screen saver. The bikers and surfers react by screaming loudly and long. Me and my daughter laughed histerically at this scene because we both don't like Justin Beiber. Apparently Disney Channel has turned on him:) Evan though the movie wasn't that terrific, I would still watch the sequel, and it really seems like there will be one!",1374969600,5,1918,4.495702005730659

5731133,5,B00CMQX84A,"I watched this movie with my two daughters and they simply loved it! With music and some actors that they both know from the Disney Channel, they were drawn in from beginning to end. In watching this I have to say that though the plot was somewhat predictable, the music was fun and you get drawn into the relationships of the characters. There also is a grease/west side story-esque quality of the movie with the turf war between the bikers and surfers which was fun. You also get a lot of stereotypes placed on certain types of characters and I was able to have a great conversation about these after the movie was over with my daughters. This is definitely a throw back to some of the beach movies of the 1960's and though my kids never saw these, they loved this and know it will be one that will be watched over and over again (I have already been told as much).

5731134,4,B00CMQX84A,"I am such a fan of the original beach movies - and own them all.  While this is a Disney TV movie, the writers were spot on with the characters, music and humor.  Adults will like this movie too.  It had EVERY cliche from the 1960's beach movies, but that's what makes it so funny and endearing.  Kandy Kane would be proud!  Hope they make a sequel, it was that good.  Now, if I could only get a poster of ""Wet Side Story""!...",1374624000,9,426,4.072289156626506
5731135,5,B00CMQX84A,I grew up watching Beach Blanket Bingo & I loved how similar this movie was.  My 4 boys loved it too!!!  The characters were perfect.  They got an extra kick that the butler from Jesse was the villain.  I just preordered our copy!,1374537600,12,230,4.27906976744186

5731138,3,B00CMQX84A,"I'm a mom of two kids and like everyone else, my fam had been looking forward to watching this since its been hyped by Disney for Months! I think Ross Lynch is a cute kid and pretty talented but thought the movie dragged a bit. Dance numbers were very good but the plot in between dragged. Much better than a lot of the Disney tv movies out there but not as good as HSM in my opinion. And seriously, with the budget Disney has, they could have hired a better editor. I cant be the only one who noticed the multitude of obvious inconsistencies and mistakes, for example, the very end when Mac is finally surfing the monster wave and she starts out with her hair down (which Brady comments on), its still down when she's paddling over to the wave, but then its miraculously in a ponytail when she gets up on the board. Little things like that irk me. Anyway, My 6 y/o loved it which must mean something!",1374451200,16,901,4.2748538011695905
5731139,4,B00CMQX84A,"My kids (ages 8 & 10) were excited to watch this due to the Disney hype, and hubby and I were just expecting to tolerate it.  Thankfully, we were wrong!  This is a fun little romp, with nods to ""classics"" like Grease, West Side Story, Beach Blanket Bingo and other like movies.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and will definitely make you laugh... now if only I could get ""Can't Stop Singing"" out of my head!  Yes, you can tell the kids are lip-syncing, but that was to be expected.  The sets, costuming, and choreography were pretty well done for a TV movie.",1374451200,46,573,4.419047619047619
5731140,5,B00CMQX84A,"To keep it short, Teen Beach Movie is a DCOM that definitely meets expectations for everyone! :) The acting is believable and good, (which is a huge deal for newer DCOM's!) and the music and dancing is so fun to watch and dance along to! People of all ages will enjoy this movie, especially people who are old enough to remember Annette Funicello, who this movie is actually dedicated to! It's a refreshing new concept that comes off brilliantly on the screen. There is no DCOM that has been like it in quality or story to date and I am so excited to see what other sequels they may come up with for it! Watch this movie on Disney Channel or buy it first, you won't be disappointed, whether you're 11, 11 in your heart but a little older on the outside, or just plain old!",1374364800,18,772,4.294520547945205

5731143,5,B00CMQX84A,"My grandchildren and I watched this movie tonite on the Disney Channel.  We all loved it.

It is reminiscent of the Grease Movie with all the wonderful dancing and singing, and 50's clothing.  But it is cleaner, and more family oriented.

We love Ross Lynch, and think he is a role model. We love seeing him on Austin and Ally and watch every week. I love watching his brothers and sister and him play and sing music, great talents and seem to have a wonderful family life.  It is nice to see kids that are real role models and not ones that are made to seem that way by press agents but in reality have real issues.

 We enjoyed seeing Maia Mitchell in this movie and thought she was charming.  She made the movie a lot of fun and did a great job as a actress. She brought a element to the movie that really endeared her to the audience.  Hope to see her in other movies.

This is just a fun movie, especially for girls, and I think it will be a classic.  Long time since I saw a good beach movie, and my remembrances are Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon and all the stars from those times, this movie reminds  me a lot of those movies.  Just lighthearted fun and light romance.

I enjoyed it, recommend it, and think it will be fun, especially for young elementary school girls and preteens.

Not often we see clean, family oriented movies that contain a bit of adventure, a smidgen of romance, and lots of great songs and dance moves.

We want to watch it again and again, so we are ordering it tonight.",1374192000,84,1510,4.282685512367491
5731144,2,B00CMQX84A,"Just finished watching this and it was painful.  This was not Disney's usual quality.  It was the worst lip sync I've ever seen.  The cutest parts of the movie they showed on the previews.  And I know Disney has enough budget to re-shoot a scene once water gets on the camera.  It's like they rushed through production - the movie doesn't flow.  And don't get me started on the second-class special effects and computer animation.  The movie was dedicated to Annette Funicello, but the movie seemed to just poke fun.",1374192000,4,516,4.666666666666667

We began watching immediately and there was a problem with the quality of the video. The screen and sound were off; there was freezing up; we tried to stick it out, but it kept messing up. We thought there could be a problem with streaming in the evening, so we tried again the next day. Same problem. I am VERY disappointed that there is no avenue on Amazon to report a problem with a digital purchase. C'mon Amazon. You should have an ear for legit customer complaints and not a simple ""no refunds on digital movies"" policy. We will be renting fewer movies in the future. We have purchased our own copy of Teen Beach Movie and will watch at home.",1529193600,,766,4.289655172413793
