4498567,3,B004XZ99W8,"This is a good companion to the ""American Grindhouse"" documentary as the two overlap in the movies they handle. This one, though, deals specifically with the exploitation films made in the Philippines.

For my dollar this is not as good as ""American Grindhouse"" because, as many crappy, exploitative movies as I've seen in my life, few of them were these movies. The obvious high points were in the section dealing with the Roger Corman films. ""The Big Bird Cage,"" ""The Big Doll House"" among others were fairly well distributed in the States. They also had a section dealing with ""Apocalypse Now"" which, of course, has made film history. This was interesting but rather strayed from the mark because it was the exception. Yes, they exploited countless Philippinos while making the movie, but it wasn't an exploitation movie which is what this documentary is all about.

A lot of these cheesy monster movies weren't shown at the local independent theaters. They were primarily the fodder for drive-ins, which might lend a certain sense of nostalgia to some viewers, but won't strike as deeply into the culture as the films covered in ""American Grindhouse."" For instance: They do a section on a Philippino, midget, action star named Weng Weng. I guess he was a big deal and made a lot of movies but I don't ever recall having seen or heard of him. They gave him a good ten minutes here.

This really is a must see because, in it's own way, it left a mark in film making. It dealt in a time and place where you could make movies on a shoestring and get decent distribution for them. Some of the stars, directors, editors that got started here went on to greater fame and fortune. There are an assortment of talking heads on display as well. John Landis, Eddie Romero, Chris Mitchum, Sid Haig et al are all on hand to fill in the blanks on what must have been a really whacky time in the history of film.",1319760000,5,1900,4.59882005899705

4498569,5,B004XZ99W8,"Quite an interesting look at the ""B"" movie market. Films reviewed include monster movies, women in prison movies, war movies, and so on, it's a very interesting look.",1364428800,,166,4.964285714285714
4498570,4,B004XZ99W8,"I never feel as though I can truly explain the appeal b-movies have for me.  I usually end up mumbling something about how unpredictable they CAN be (although sadly, not often enough), or that, in the midst of an otherwise unbearable film, there may be one crystalline moment that is so good in relation to the surrounding badness that it has an extra pop that rarely happens in mainstream films.  Whatever; even re-reading what I just wrote sounds like pure justification for guilty pleasures, gratuitous nudity, and mondo extreme filmmaking.

Luckily, as films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Grindhouse/dp/B004XEEM9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Grindhouse</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Not-Quite-Hollywood/dp/B002S2UH42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Not Quite Hollywood</a>, and Machete Maidens prove (along with several others I haven't had a chance to see yet), I'm not the only one who has an appreciation for these flicks.  Like the other two I mentioned, this one also concentrates on the underground/ b-movie industry of a particular country rather than a specific genre, in this case the Philippines.  So we get clips from early 60's to late 70's horror, blaxploitation, war films, women's prison films, and, strangely, spy/kung fu/midget movies.  Meanwhile, those actors and filmmakers who are still around comment on their roles in the industry, and there is usually some film critic to put the output in context.

The formula for these documentaries is fairly simply; if you've seen one, you'll know what to expect from the others.  That isn't a knock against them - I don't know anything else that would be more effective.  In Machete Maidens, we hear from stars Pam Grier and Sid Haig, and filmmakers Roger Corman and John Landis to name a few that might be more recognizable, plus some of the Filipino directors such as Eddie Romero and Cirio Santiago.

Another reason this film may seem familiar in its structure is because director Mark Hartley also directed Not Quite Hollywood, which examines the b-movie output of Australia, and had previously made a career out of 'behind the scenes' documentaries of films that one usually finds in the special features section of DVD releases.  Now, if that sort of minutiae about b-movie film and fringe filmmaking is in any way interesting to you, you are going to like Machete Maidens.  Even if not, they are still entertaining - most of the best, strangest, and most humorous parts of the films are shown in short, easily digestible clips.  My wife, who usually rolls her eyes when I reach for my stack of as-yet-unwatched DVDs, enjoyed Not Quite Hollywood, and would have probably like this one as well.  If I had anything bad to say about the film, it would be the absence of an interview with the great stalwart Filipino actor Vic Diaz.  We see him in a few clips, but his name is never even mentioned in passing, which makes me wonder if there wasn't some sort of legal reason for the snub.  As far as I know, Diaz is still alive, although supposedly in ill health; it's too bad he couldn't have been a part of this.  He played in so many of these films, it would be interesting to hear what he thought of them.

Recommended for film enthusiasts of all kinds, and for anyone who would like to be exposed in a minor way to some strange and often outlandish films.

4498571,5,B004XZ99W8,"I watched tons of these movies as a kid.  Couldn't rent the ""Adult"" stuff, but easy to get to rent ""R"" rated movies and the VHS rental market was dumped with these B movies real quick:-)

This is a neat chunk of American film history, a real nice insight into the times.

Lots of fun to watch, it makes you want to buy tons of obscure drive in movies.",1356739200,,351,4.057971014492754
4498572,5,B004XZ99W8,"Gave it a 5 as documentary type films are hard to hold interest and they did a very nice job with this -- and for folks like me that graduated High School in the 70's, this is a warm nostalgic place---- we remember loading up the car with beer and take out pizza on the way, hitting the Drive in and watching these so -- seeing the background behind it all and so forth, was something I got into a lot.  So for all you drive in generation out there ---this will be a treat, and if you have developed a liking for these films, then I suggest getting this even more -- seen a preview for it?  The DVD is as crazy, campy and as fun as the preview you saw was -- so if that tripped your gears, you won't regret making this a purchase.",1343174400,2,730,3.9591836734693877
4498573,4,B004XZ99W8,"This is a fun documentary on the Filipino wave of exploitation flicks, primarily from the '70s. Similar in tone and execution to Not Quite Hollywood, which covered the Aussie output of that era. This pic is a little more of the hyper-cut editing style, a little glib maybe; and not as graceful or carefully wrought, though. ""Not Quite"" was a 10 out of 10 even if you never heard of or cared about the flicks being documented, just terrifically entertaining. This one is a good B+, 8 out of 10, might make you want to seek out some of the flicks, might not, but a larf anyways.",1337644800,,576,4.392523364485982
4498574,4,B004XZ99W8,"This is a very entertaining and informative documentary.  Directed by Mark Hartley, who also headed up the Ozploitation documentary Not Quite Hollywood, you'll get great insight into how American filmmakers came to work in the Philippines during the 1960s and 1970s, bringing the world hundreds of cheap, low-quality but highly entertaining movies. They capture the crazy conditions under which these movies where made, making this a time capsule of schlocky goodness.

The iconic Roger Corman serves as the starting point for these films, as many of them were made under his New World imprint.  Corman brings his usual dry sense of humor and bottom line/all about the money efficiency.  John Landis is hilarious and serves as the perfect hyperactive foil to Corman's coolly detached straight man.  Joe Dante comes in and out with how the trailers for these films were cut--because with sleazy cinema like this, it's all about how you sell it to the audience.  Getting butts into the drive-in stalls and grindhouses for beasts, breasts, and blood was the name of the game.

A lot of actors, directors and writers are here, giving their take on what it was like to be part of these wacky films. Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Dick Miller, Jack Hill, R. Lee Ermey, and many more tell their stories.  They all acknowledge that with the exception of Grier, no one became a major star and her stardom came in part because she had been freshly discovered by Hill.  But they seem okay with that and were essentially happy coming along for the ride.  No one is jaded or nursing old wounds. Everyone is in good spirits and quick to point out the absurdity of the movies.  No one was under any illusions that what they did was high art.  Such self-awareness makes for enjoyable viewing.

The true highlight of the film is listening to the Filipino directors who headed many of these films.  Eddie Romero, Cirio Santiago, and others give unique perspective into their sincerity for giving A-list effort to otherwise B and C, Y and Z-list movies.  Their earnestness is charming and allows you to appreciate their work, no matter how cheesy.

The doc is edited to move fast, much like the movies it highlights.  While that makes for good watching, it doesn't always allow for much insight.  Topics, such as how little money/regard was given to Filipino stunt actors and the living nightmare that was the making of Coppola's Apocalypse Now sort of get a quick brushing over.  It would have been nice to learn more about those topics.

All in all, Machete Maidens Unleashed is a very good primer to anyone interested in film history and b-movies in general.",1333497600,7,2632,4.819599109131403

8447786,5,B004XZ99W8,"In the 1960s and 70s, drive-in movie theaters and big city grindhouses were eager to book the wildest and most action-packed fare they could find, and low-budget producers were always on the lookout for something unique to offer their viewers. Many of them found it in the Philippines, a country full of exotic locations, cooperative officials and folks willing to work cheap. Local producer Eddie Romero began exporting his cut-rate horror and crime pictures to American distributors in the 60s, and before long U.S. filmmakers were traveling there to shoot crazed jungle epics, women in prison thrillers, bloody horror stories and violent wartime dramas. It certainly helped that Philippine extras and technicians would work hard for low pay, and that local stuntmen didn't seem to worry much about risking their necks for a good shot; as one producer put it, ""Human life was cheap, film was cheap -- it was a great place to shoot a movie!""
