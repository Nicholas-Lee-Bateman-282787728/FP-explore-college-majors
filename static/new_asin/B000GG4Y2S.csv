2610785,5,B000GG4Y2S,"This movie brought me in tears.  I could not stop laughing.  I've seen this movie doznes of times.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh.  This is hands down the funniest movie I've ever seen.

Funniest parts:  When perry sees his own action character; being hit in the face with the basketball; being caught in Oklahomos; basically every seen.

Enjoy",1160179200,2,352,4.766666666666667

2610787,5,B000GG4Y2S,"I know a lot of you think this is all scripted, that Perry is not real but some made-up character. Bollocks I say! Perry is as real as it gets. So are the jokes played on him! And to all you Perry-fans, you should also check him out in a movie called ""The Bank Job"", he plays a drug dealer in it. Good times.",1157414400,7,308,3.828125
2610788,5,B000GG4Y2S,"Windy City Heat totally blew me away with how funny it was, sounds bad but I wasn't expecting much.  Forget that. This movie is hysterical.  You can see yourself pulling this on one of your buddies the whole time you're watching it.  Stunt Man!",1156291200,4,244,4.5
2610789,5,B000GG4Y2S,"Put quite simply, it's the funniest movie I have ever seen.

This movie is a gift and a curse. A gift in the way that You'll have tremendous, unbelievable fun watching it. A curse in the fact that, after seeing it, it will almost certainly consume your life. The universe of Perry and the big three go far beyond this movie. And you just want to experience every crumb of it that you'll spend months getting invested in the Perry universe that is changing and continuing even to this very day.

Also a curse in that you'll want everyone to see it, but you'll never reach that goal. Seeing this movie and understanding Perry is like being part of a very exclusive club. Those who have seen it understand and appreciate it. Those who haven't don't understand it- and are reluctant to even spend the time to watch it. It's hard to explain to people. This is the way it will usually go. You'll try to describe it adequately, and fail. Beg them to watch it, most won't. But the very few who do then join this very exclusive club. And then become what you are. Someone who desperately tries to get others to experience this movie with mixed results.

A coworker told me about this movie and I haven't looked back since. Here I am telling you that this is the best ten dollars you will ever spend. Watch this movie. Join the club.",1475280000,2,1323,4.391836734693878

2610794,5,B000GG4Y2S,"I love this movie. It is criminally underrated as it is a masterpiece of observing the human condition. The trials and tribulations of the hero of this movie, Peary Karamello, are amazing to witness.
His bravery shown in this humble offering of cinema excellence is something to inspire and enrich every viewer. Especially Randy Callihan.
For a lowly gypsy javaho to struggle with both his Italian heritage and his sexuality, while fighting with his friends whom are true saints, to reach stardom is a life lesson for us all to take away from this epic piece of living history.
Bless mr. Kimmel for not holding a grudge after the scare master sued him for nonexistent residuals and dooming the production of windy city heat 2 as well as losing any money that mr. Karamello could then give to prostitutes or spend on dog treats for his fake religion.
Thanks also for the comic genius of both mr. Barris and mr. Mole in the movie, as well the  hilarious big 3 podcast.
I wish I could continue to follow the adventures of our loveable dog worshipping, government scamming javaho, though it seems they have sadly split apart (hopefully for just the time being).
I will instead have to settle on catching up with Perry at the Denny's men's room on Reseda Blvd like every other man looking for greasy, hairy, Italian, man on man sexual release.
Please please please please please please please EVERYONE.
PLEASE watch this movie.
Between this movie and their excellent podcast, this might be one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed.
Bravo.

2610803,5,B000GG4Y2S,This is honestly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Perry is clearly a little off as his friends constantly goof on him with his delusions of grandeur. I have watched this movie numerous times and each time I pick up another joke I may of missed. There are a lot of subtle laughs to look for and that's not even including the hilarious pranks pulled on Perry Caramello. The situations and hijinks are all cleverly done. This movie keeps you teetering back and forth wondering if the Perry truly doesn't understand that it's all a gag on him. It will keep you guessing to and that's part of the fun of watching.

The only reason this film didn't get the accolades it richly deserved at the time of it's release (it was basically buried by the geniuses at Comedy Central) is because it was so far ahead of its time.

Many twists and turns have taken place hopefully culminating in a sequel film, or reality TV show.  Hopefully Perry Karamello who is 100% real, doesn't completely screw up the whole project again.

2610816,5,B000GG4Y2S,"Late to the party as usual, I first saw Windy City Heat in early 2012. It came highly recommended for years and I finally took the plunge. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard!

I won't bother rehashing the plot, as several other reviews likely have. (check out Amazon's Product Description for a concise, spoiler-free explanation) What I will do is promise you this movie is INCREDIBLY FUNNY and the less you know about it before seeing it, the better.

It's a shame Comedy Central basically disowned the project, as it belongs in their Hall of Fame, alongside other legendary network originals like South Park and Chappelle's Show.

There's a wealth of hilarious mythology related to the ""Perry Project"" (as it was originally known) out there, but this is where you should start. Because believe me, once you do, you won't want to stop.

PS - My review title, about laughing so hard I worried I'd die, is absolutely true. In fact, it's happened twice..",1391212800,7,966,4.732142857142857

2610818,1,B000GG4Y2S,"Ugh.  Even if this weren't mean-spirited, juvenile, exploitative, and simple-minded, it wouldn't be funny.  If it had been made by a cast of high-school kids still cutting their comedy teeth, it might be noteworthy, but the only thing remarkable about it is the extent to which the production team went to fool the mentally-challenged Caravello.  The actual material isn't creative, isn't imaginative, and isn't entertaining.  I can see why this would attract a cult following, but I suspect it did so mainly because it can't hack it as a smaller fish in a bigger comedy pond.

Windy City Heat has been my favorite comedy since I first saw it on Comedy Central many years back, and stands up to repeat viewings.  In fact, you'll pick stuff up each time.  Not only are there so many jokes and suggestive comments tpward Perry, but you'll miss them from laughing at the line before.  Don't miss the Big 3 Podcast, where Don and Mole continue to torment Perry weekly in an audio format.  You can find the Big 3 guys on Twitter and Facebook, too.

But as for whether this movie is funny--ultimately what you care about--there's a problem.

There are about 4 or 5 extremely funny scenes, most everybody can agree.  However, they have all be leaked to a certain well-known video-sharing site which Amazon would probably prefer I not name.

Mole in particular is hilarious, his character's look/voice/behavior is ridiculous, I loved it. Definitely check this movie out, and check out their Big 3 podcast on iTunes. It's basically a continuation on the antics these guys pulled here, i.e. bringing up (constantly) the whole situation where Perry had sex with a man, having conversations with a pre-recorded phone call from John Quiny Adams (AHAHA) and updates on who Perry's suing now.

Now give this person the glass-swallowing voice of a female version of Sam Kinison.  Finally, make this person borderline retarded and completely oblivious like Jeff Daniels' character in Dumb and Dumber.  This is ""Scary"" Perry Caravello.

Perry stars as Stone Fury in the production of ""Windy City Heat,"" and he thinks it's going to be huge.  In fact, he mentions the Oscar's and thinks he beat out Brad Pitt, Schwarzenegger, and Harrison Ford for the role.  He thinks the role of Stone Fury was made for him, and he's in full-on prima-donna mode, screaming at everyone on set and comparing himself to Steven Seagal, Robert De Niro, and Jackie Chan.

Too bad it's all an intricate prank devised by his ""friends,"" the actual movie is the biggest piece of garbage ever made, and all the acting is similar to three goons in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spirit/dp/B001RHGRT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spirit</a>.  Except those guys acted brain-dead on purpose.

He's constantly getting dissed, nobody shakes his hand, and nothing goes his way.  It's completely hilarious how he thinks he's a megastar upon his first day on set, yet everyone involved treats him like garbage.  The set assistants put him in a raggedy trailer.  The costume design people mistakenly dress him in The merchandising people make his doll look morbidly obese.  The director has Perry thrown in a dumpster filled with manure.  The abuse this guy mindlessly takes is brilliant, and he deserves every bit of it.  He's possibly the most ignorant, jingoistic, racist, xenophobic moron in Hollywood (and that's saying something considering the city).

If you hate egotistical Hollywood idiots, love the Three Stooges, and want to see a full movie version of Punk'd - a version that's actually funny - then this will have you laughing until it hurts.  Congratulations goes out to everyone involved in setting this guy up like the Sissy Spacek in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/0792839676/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>.

Staged or not, he does get to star in his own movie.  Everybody's in on the joke, except him.  Hilarious!  Poor guy asks for a stunt double, then realizes in utter shock his stand-in gets to have real sex with a hot Z-list actress.  Aww, shucks!  At least he also turned down the rimjob scene.

And Windy City Heat is the king of practical jokes. Perry tries out for a movie called `Windy City Heat', and gets the lead role of Stone Fury, the sports detective! But what Perry doesn't know is that this is all fake and everyone is in on it. This is for real by the way. The movie we as the viewers watch is one very big joke. Perry never catches on. That's how oblivious he is. You might be thinking this sounds pretty mean, but Perry doesn't act retarded, he just acts...well...pretty normal, but not. To help hide the fact that this is a joke, his buddies tell him that all the cameras are for the documentary that will go on the DVD for the movie. As the fake movie is being made, many pranks are played on Perry, such as making him be thrown into a dumpster full of manure to add `realism', making him think the movie won't be finished because he wasn't able to guard a table of doughnuts, to him getting an award from the president of show business. He never catches on. The movie is filled with laughs and shocks. My roommate made me buy this so I'd watch it. While I was starting to watch it, I had no clue what I was in for, but after a few minutes in, I could tell this was a masterpiece. I almost feel bad for laughing at Perry, but, the way he acts, I just couldn't help myself. And good god, don't make him mad. When he screams, he sounds like a 13 year old girl not getting her way. His voice gets so high it's hilarious. I honestly don't see how he stays friends with Tony and Don. But it seems like he doesn't even remember the stuff they do to him after a few minutes. Many cameos are in here such as Dane Cook being a casting director, Bobcat Goldthwait (directing the movie we watch and the movie Perry is in), Adam Carolla, Jimmy Kimmel, Carson Daily (which provokes a great line I can't type here from Perry), and even ex-NFL lineman Refrigerator Perry.

I don't think this is for everyone, but man I found it hilarious. I definitely recommend a must rent. Make sure you watch the extras too for more laughs. Also, while I'm sure this is funny alone, this movie is perfect for viewing with friends... and beer.

P.S. - Perry says one of the funniest and most shocking things I think I've ever heard on camera. Seriously, who says that when they know they are being filmed? If you want me to say it I'll say it in my comments, but otherwise, it's close to end, and you will DEFINITELY know what I'm talking about when he says it. I rewound it three times to hear him say it. Friggin hilarious.",1243209600,2,2836,4.299065420560748

2610860,5,B000GG4Y2S,"Simply stunning that a film like this could exist.  Simply stunning that a character like Perry exists.  As mind-boggling as it is hilarious.

The real movie does not exist, yet in his commentary (done two years later), Perry talks about 'getting the role' genuinely as if it was all for real.  Though he does also make reference to it being like a reality show, he still thinks most of the situations were for real (BTW, you have to check out Burt Ward's appearance in the commentary).

At least I don't have to feel bad for Perry about what they did to him.  Hell, they gave him a wonderful ride.  In an extra, we see him watch the film with Mole and Barris (this film, not the 'real' one), and he has a glimmer in his eye every time he his honored (i.e. 'getting the role' and being given an award by the 'President of Show Business'--in fact, he gets choked up seeing the 'President's' award in the commentary).

Knowing him so well for so long, I believe Don and 'Mole' knew what they could get away with without Perry either catching on or being crushed in the end.  Which is apparantly ANYTHING.

He does seem to get a few things ('Roman Polanski,' Charlton Heston being fake, some of the pranks they played on him), but his thought to this day is that it was overall mostly genuine.

I am just glad to see that at the end of the commentary he feels his dreams were fulfilled.  And Perry, if you are reading this:  they were, my friend, they were...",1180483200,15,1456,4.368029739776952

Unbelievably, he still seems to have trouble realizing the whole movie is a joke on him...or maybe the joke is on them since Perry actually did get to star in a movie called Windy City Heat!  Since then, they've been continuing the prank, telling him Johnny Knoxville is going to play his role in Windy City Heat - Part 2.

For those who think the movie was staged, I have first hand proof of the star's gullibility.  I e-mailed him through Myspace and offered him $5000 to host the opening of my new night club (I don't own a night club).

Perrys veins are popping out of his head while his voice climbs two octaves while yelling at his co-hearts.

2610888,4,B000GG4Y2S,"If one had to rate something merely on ambition, 'Windy City Heat' would, without question, deserve five stars.  It is perhaps both the best and worst example of cinematic exploitation I've ever seen, and because I've become so desensitized over the course of my life, I commend the film far more for the former than the latter.

Now the question of whether this is 'real' or a [...] has come up, and frankly here's my thoughts on it: it's real, or at least, most of it is.  If anyone is doubtful of this, they need but to watch the extra features on the DVD.  Perry Caravello, the real-life 'actor' and the film's focal point for mockery, is indeed a real person.  In 'Windy City Heat', he plays the role of himself, to us, the audience; to his deluded mind, he plays the role of 'Stone Fury', the star of a Hollywood action film in the making.  Questions inevitably arise because, naturally, anyone with half a brain watches with utmost skepticism.  Surely nobody in Caravello's position could be so ignorant of the events that take place?  But, yes, somebody could -- Caravello himself. The story, as one becomes familiar with through the extra features, goes a bit like this:

The two guys who play Caravello's sidekicks in 'Windy City Heat' (the absurd, fake film) -- Tony Barbieri as ""Mole"" and Don Barris as ""Big Lou"" -- have actually been screwing around with him for like, a decade. This becomes apparent as one views the extra footage on the dvd, which demonstrates short clips of Barbieri and Barris harassing Caravello, all the way back to 1996. And it's not staged... completely real.  Barbieri and Barris -- who I might add are ...awesome... here -- are the type of guys who transcend shame and empathy for outrageous, condescending comedy at the sake of a mentally challenged 'entertainer', in this case Caravello.  They had basically mastered this circus act over many years, and that it all comes together so perfectly in this film isn't quite as perplexing when you're able to understand this.  And, again -- especially after viewing the films numerous times; I have seen it four -- one ultimately realizes that Caravello is, in many respects, retarded; his obviously demented behavior lends credibility to the whole 'it's real' thing.  If, in fact, Caravello 'was' performing all of this as an act, I'd personally think him to be the next Pacino, because no Human being can emulate a persona like his so utterly convincing.

And so, the joke goes on from there.  Everyone in the film takes stabs at the situation, and while it's usually hit and miss, it's always entertaining if only for the premise.  Take, for example, Perry getting thrown into a dumpster of manurer for a 'more realistic approach'.  Or Perry chugging a blended pizza, donut, and beer not once, but twice for a scene.  And these are just the most obvious examples of how they mentally screw with the guy; subtle gags literally run through the entire thing, rarely letting up.  My favorite, personally, is when they get to the ""merchandising"" of the film, and each of the three leads are shown their action figures.  Mole and Big Lou's are presented first, completely normal and visually representative of themselves; Perry, on the other hand -- after a drum role by the crew, to add effect -- is shown his figure... the most grotesque little doll imaginable, with a green face, huge gut, his face gawking sideways, seemingly ready to hurl.  The figure is ""so"" impeccably perfect that just the thought gets me rolling.  Perry's reaction is cut quickly but obvious -- he doesn't know what to make of it, but is somewhat sure that something isn't right.

The film needs to be seen to be respected, though it's definitely not for everyone.  The bottom line is most of us 'DO' find this stuff hilarious, even if it's in bad taste. There are a variety of human beings on this Earth, some smart, some not so smart.  It's part of the ever-progressing humor we seem to take on as a whole collective these days; cynical mockery of the bizarre circumstances found within the reality we live in.  And hey, if a guy like Caravello can make it through this impossible set of circumstances shown in the film, I'm pretty confident that, at whatever point he found out the trick was on him, he didn't sink into an everlasting state of psychological despair.

If 'Windy City Heat' were more consistent through its run, I'd be honored to award it five stars.  Due to its sheer originality and its stunning ability to ACTUALLY PULL IT OFF, I really want to give it a perfect rating, but alas it is slow at times without much laughs for often minutes at a time.  But when it strikes, oh lord how it strikes the most radiant of gold.

Update: I was just reading about Perry's life, and I don't know if this information is correct, but it's been said that he was actually an intelligent, suave, good guy, but was in an automobile accident in late high school. This really makes me sad, actually, and I'm really interested in this weird guy now. Anyway, I just found it strangely profound, that he's possibly this way because of horrible circumstances early in his life, pondering the thought of how his 'previous' being -- before the brain damage -- would look upon all of this. Again, sad...",1160352000,11,5257,4.682608695652174
