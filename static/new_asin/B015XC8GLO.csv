7453324,5,B015XC8GLO,"Forbidden Hollywood, Volume 9 is a collection of five movies, four made before and one made after Hollywoods restrictive Production Code took widespread effect. The Production Code was a set of moral guidelines that was applied to most American films released by major studios from 1930 to 1968. It was strictly enforced beginning in 1934. From 1934 to 1954, the Code was closely identified with Joseph Breen, the administrator appointed by Will Hays, president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. By the late 1950s, the influence of television, foreign films, adventurous directors pushing the envelope, and free-speech decisions from the courts began to weaken the Code.

The films in this collection represent Hollywoods last efforts for years to come in dealing with touchy subject matter. Joan Blondell stars as a free-wheeling chorus girl who hooks up with the ultimate hick (Eric Linden) in Melvyn LeRoys Big City Blues (1932), featuring a young Humphrey Bogart. Richard Dix stars as a convict working the road crew for a corrupt warden in Rowland Browns Hells Highway (1932). Bette Davis utters the immortal line Id love to kiss you but I just washed my hair to Richard Barthelmess in Michael Curtizs The Cabin in the Cotton (1932). Myrna Loy stars as a writer with extramarital designs in When Ladies Meet (1933). Pat OBrien and Ann Dvorak star in the tale of a Second Avenue auctioneer who gets played by a society grifter in Robert Floreys I Sell Anything (1934).

There are no bonus features on this 4-disc DVD set.",1449014400,9,1552,5.011627906976744
7453325,4,B015XC8GLO,I look forward to these releases I love the pre code films. The packaging is horrendous I had to return the first set do to damage. These films deserve better Warner Archives is getting cheaper in quality but raising its prices on all their new releases. Just a heads up I sell everything was released in October of 1934 which would make it not a pre code film.,1448755200,2,361,4.323529411764706
7453326,5,B015XC8GLO,"The ""Forbidden Hollywood"" series from Warner Brothers started in 2006 and is still going strong (it also includes films from MGM and RKO).
Thirty-nine films to date.
Highlight of Volume Nine is young Bette Davis in an atypical role in 'The Cabin in the Cotton' (1932):
""I'd like to kiss ya, but I just washed my hair''.

In 2009, Universal released the six film ""Pre-Code Hollywood"" collection (the films were actually produced by Paramount)
In 2012, TCM Vault Collection followed with the five film ""Columbia Pictures Pre-Code Collection""

If you are new to the ""Forbidden Hollywood"" series, Volume Two is actually the best place to start.
It includes the excellent documentary:
""Though Shalt Not: Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood"" produced by Turner Classic Movies.

Volumes 1-3 of ""Forbidden Hollywood"" were deluxe productions on the Turner Classics Movies ""TCM Archive"" label.
Pressed on standard DVDs with English SDH subtitles.
Volumes Two and Three included documentaries about Pre-Code Hollywood, plus commentary tracks for some of the films.
Beginning with Volume Four, the series switched to the bare-bones ""Warner Archive Collection"" DVD-R format (no subtitles or extra features)
People bad-mouth DVD-Rs, but I haven't had any playback problems (yet).

I am preparing a second list of  recommended Pre-Code films that were omitted from the eleven boxes.
Any suggestions?
See the first comment after this review.

7453327,5,B015XC8GLO,"Great Movies, but Disappointed the Discs Were Burned, Not Pressed.

++++ UPDATE ++++++
Based on comments that others made here, I re-purchased this collection from TCM, (Turner classic movies). The discs were indeed Pressed!  The set I purchased from Amazon is now in a landfill.  Also the TCM case is much better.
+++++  END UPDATE+++++

As most of you know, discs that are burned may not have the durability or lifespan of a pressed disc. I'm surprised that they did burn the discs because of the volume of sales I would expect.  Although, these pre-code movies go, ""over the heads"" of younger (18 - 35) audiences, .

The video and audio quality of all the movies varied from good to excellent.  And no, the holy grail of all pre-code movies, ""Convention City"" is not in this collection.  The collection contains four discs and came in a poor quality case, which had failed during shipping. The discs played fine but I had to replace the case with one of better quality.

Please don't let me be too discouraging, these are all great movies and this is about the only way you can see them.",1446163200,24,1090,4.601036269430052
8734884,3,B015XC8GLO,"Great set, but why, Warner, why are they burned discs (at this price)? My disc three, ""Cabin in the Cotton"" won't play. I am denied seeing a young Bette Davis with bleached-blond hair. So sad. I will try to exchange and hope for the best.",1527724800,,238,4.311111111111111
8734885,5,B015XC8GLO,"I like the Forbidden Hollywood series very much and this DVD set is no exception. All 5 films are high quality very few scratches and pops if any. Compared to the other available pre-code sets out there, the Forbidden Hollywood series is top-of-the-line. They are a little more pricey than the other collections out there but it's really worth it for the restoration value. I highly recommend this set and the series in general.",1527120000,,428,4.797297297297297

8734890,4,B015XC8GLO,"I wasn't totally turned on by the titles offered in this set, but once I started watching I had to admit that this was a pretty good set that featured some of my favorite '30's stalwarts. Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Myrna Loy, and even crusty Richard Dix.
The disks are burned and not pressed which will affect their longevity, but this will give most pre-code addicts many hours of fun.
At this point, who knows what technology holds in the future. I'm in the moment right now. Just waiting to see Convention City show up somewhere.",1467590400,2,535,4.583333333333333

8734893,5,B015XC8GLO,Worth the price for When Ladies Meet.  Ann Harding & Myrna Loy - a great movie; adult & witty.  Plus Robert Montgomery & Alice Brady!  One of the best of the early 1930's films.  The others are pretty routine.,1449187200,8,209,4.282051282051282
