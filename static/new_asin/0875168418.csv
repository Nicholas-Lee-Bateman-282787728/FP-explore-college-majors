7793282,5,0875168418,"This video of Dr. John Thie explaining and briefly demonstrating Touch For Health Kinesiology gives a good overview of the system and the intention of the work. Although many health professionals incorporate Touch For Health Kinesiology and other kinesiology based work in their practice, Touch For Health Kinesiology was originally designed for lay people. This is not a video geared to train professionals, but a very good introduction with quality graphics presented by Dr. Thie, the originator of Touch For Health Kinesiology. If you have taken Touch For Health Kinesiology and want a useful video of someone explaining it clearly, this is the best video to get.",1400112000,4,666,5.233644859813084

7793284,2,0875168418,I got this video as a companion for the book I already had and was hoping for something that expanded on the book but this video has none of that.,1332288000,2,146,3.9
7793285,2,0875168418,"I was anxious to learn more about Touch for Health after being introduced to it a couple weeks ago.  I bought the video believing that it is an instructional guide to accompany the book ""The Complete Edition Touch for Health"".
I usually play instructional videos on my computer using Ms Windows Media Player.  I had trouble getting this video to play on my HP computer and would not play at all on a Gateway computer.  When I finally got it to work, the sound was so low that even with both my computer and media player on 100% volume, the narration can barely be heard.  Part of the dialog cannot be heard at all.
The video played well on my television DVD player with adequate sound volume.
The volume of narrator often fades at the end of her sentences so that it is difficult to get the meaning without replaying that section several times.
The video starts with an introduction by TFH founder, John Thie.
Then there is an elementary anatomical explanation of the spine & vertebrae, sacrum & coccyx, which should be unnecessary for any massage therapist or healthcare professional.
There are nice graphics on energy flow in the meridians.
There is a quick explanation of 5 Methods for correcting weak muscles.
There is only one complete demonstration of John Thie treating a patient.  It states that he tests all 14 meridians, but there is little or no explanation of which meridian or specific muscles are being tested as the demonstration continues.

There are several testimonials at the end of the video, but there was only a brief clip of them being treated or no video of treatment.
Although I find the video somewhat helpful in understanding the book, I believe that it is over-priced and too infomercial-like.
I expected more detail on the vaious techniques and rationale for the sequence in testing and treatment of various merdians and muscles.
The textbook ""The Complete Edition, Touch for Health"" is a wonderful source of information for anyone learning meridians and acupressure points, a great value.",1303344000,39,2018,4.834782608695652
7793286,5,0875168418,"If you are curious about what is done in a session using Touch for Health this is a great starter video. It covers the some of the basic theory on Touch for Health and then shows an actual balancing procedure. Demonstrates goal setting and the 14 muscle tests and their re balancing procedure and the outcome. It is not a long video, less than an hour perhaps. I am simply in awe of John Thie's approach as a healer and will watch it again, not only for the technical part, but mostly to see a real master loving his craft. I give this film 5 stars because he is simply so inspiring to watch.",1295654400,17,592,4.201754385964913
