8012647,5,B0001H69L6,"Jungle Cubs was one of the great old shows of my youth. It shows the lives of Baloo, Bagheera, Hahti, Kaa, Louie and Shere Khan as cubs before they meet Mowgli. I've seen Jungle Cubs on Disney Channel and Toon Disney all of these years ago. Too bad that the series never had a true DVD release but these tapes will do.",1325808000,,318,4.145161290322581
