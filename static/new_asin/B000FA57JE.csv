2557108,4,B000FA57JE,"I DID NOT THINK I WOULD LIKE THIS PLAY BECAUSE MADEA WAS NOT IN IT, (IT'S NOT QUITE AS FUNNY WITHOUT MADEA), BUT IT IS GOOD. I CAN REALLY RELATE TO THIS PLAY AS A MARRIED WOMAN. I HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THAT PLAY. IT'S VERY SPIRITUAL AND IT LETS YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, HE WILL BRING YOU THROUGH!

2557109,5,B000FA57JE,"I enjoyed this DVD.  I thought Kelly Price would be in the play, but it turns out that Cheryl Pepsi Riley was the star.  She did an excellent job and was in good voice.

The storyline was behind every good man is a good woman.  It also let you know that marriage is hard work.  It is not just a fine man/woman.  When the body goes and the love is old, we have to remember the wedding vows.

The family/friends are all coming together for a weekend retreat at the patriachs house for a weekend of rest and relaxation.  The father offers words wisdom that his wife used to offer before she died.

One couple has worked on their marriage and made it worked; but when the wife in the other couple discovers that her husband is cheating with her best friend, she goes balistic and shoots up the place.  After the divorce, she gives him everything in the divorce settlement and begins to work on herself.  He marries the friend and she marries someone no one thinks will ever settle down because he has always been in love with her.  Her husband discovers that the grass is not always greener on the other side and wants her back.  His busines is falling off and she tells him that she is the one that kept him afloat.  He begins to think back and would do anything to get his wife back and give his gold digging new wife back.",1151712000,38,1321,4.253012048192771

2557344,2,B000FA57JE,"I am a HUGE fan of Mr. Tyler Perry, but this play was not that great.  It seemed like it was thrown together.  Sometimes they would forget their lines and just babble, it was weird.  The background music was too low and the mics were too loud, so when they were singing it sounded a bit off key.  The woman who played Diana could not sing at all and it was very annoying to listen too. The funniest parts were with Poppy.",1390003200,,421,4.097560975609756

2557373,5,B000FA57JE,"A great Tyler Perry play - one of the best plays, in my opinion.  All of the characters are high spirited and interact very well.  The story line is super predictable, but it is not dull - you root for the underdogs, the true friends, and those who just do what they believe is right.  There is a heavy Christian theme, but I am not a Christian and I enjoy the play very much.  Thanks to Amazon for making it available for a pretty reasonable price.",1381708800,,449,4.186046511627907

2557396,5,B000FA57JE,"I Loved this play and the message that comes with it concerning marriage. Proverbs 18:22 says - A man that finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord, the man is the one who suppose to be pursuing his soul mate not the other way around, so until we do things in decency and in order, the way the GOOD LORD has already out lined for us we will always go astray. This movie is a must see for singles wanting to be married one day, and for those who are already married, Tyler Perry did it again because he acknowledges GOD in all or his work.",1357257600,2,561,4.017857142857143

2557399,5,B000FA57JE,"This play is slightly different from Mr. Perry's other plays, mainly because Madea is not in it. The great thing is that the play was still enjoyable! The relationship of Tony Grant, Cheryl Pepsii Riley and Demetria Dyan McKinney made for a very interesting, very surprising plot! I enjoyed every minute of it!

P.S. If you're trying to decide whether to watch this movie based on the preview clip shown above, that clip is from the opening of the play. It does no justice to how wonderful the play actually is! Trust me, you'll enjoy it!",1335484800,2,538,4.604166666666667

2557406,5,B000FA57JE,"I saw the movie for this and thought that was great, not knowing at the time he had a screenplay version to it. This play was absolutely wonderful. I do not regret purchasing this DVD. It had me laughing, getting to know each character's personality, and at the same time expose you to some serious issues that may be happening to people in their marriages today and each character's take on the dos and donts when in relationships. I don't care what anyone says about Tyler Perry; this play was nice. I cant wait for his next play, The Marriage Counselor, to come out on DVD!",1217548800,,576,4.443396226415095
2557407,5,B000FA57JE,Just one of Tyler Perry's plays I didn't have and wanted. I got it and love it just like all the rest.,1214784000,,102,3.6818181818181817
2557408,5,B000FA57JE,"I enjoy Tyler Perry but this was my favorite play!  Perry is a writer after my own heart.  He manages to show how good sexuality is in marriage, which is hard to find in the Christian movies or books I'm used to reading.  His work is refreshing and entertaining.  In this particular play, he does an excellent job in combining humor into serious subject matter.  It's focus is on an unfaithful spouse who ends up leaving his wife for a thin and ""prettier"" woman (who happens to be a friend of the wife's).  The husband's treatment of his wife is a powerful description of verbal abuse, and I felt horrible for the wife, which was the point.

The second half of the play covered the next year at the cabin, and I had hoped the now ex-wife would be happier and the way Perry dragged that part out had me on the edge of my seat because I feared that she didn't end up with the man I hoped she would.  I don't want to ruin it but it is the best scene in the play and I found myself cheering when I discovered who her new love was.  By the audience's cheers, I wasn't alone in my joy.  This play is worth watching at least once.  And the songs are great too!

2557427,5,B000FA57JE,"A play without Madea generally makes one pause. This was truly an awesome play with deep moving messages about marriage and relationships.

2557429,4,B000FA57JE,"I think I can safely say this is my favourite Tyler Perry piece.  The plot is relative to standard marriages and the actors can really sing - wait-a-go Pepsi!  Diana and Terry show what forgiveness in marriages can achieve even after adultery is committed, something that many people nowadays don't bother with.  All-in-all, worth adding to my collection for an evening of entertaining couples.",1176249600,,394,5.125

2557461,5,B000FA57JE,"Unlike the majority of Tyler's plays, this one doesn't have his Madea character in it.  But,that does not make it less of an amazing show.  I really enjoyed this one.  It was very funny and serious at the same time.  The singing was dynamic.  I especially liked ""Pepsii's""(I think I misspelled that)singing.  She has such a powerful voice. The cast was awesome together.  Even the surprise character near the end.  She was soo funny!",1175126400,,433,4.756756756756757
2557462,5,B000FA57JE,"Oh Tyler got another hit with this one!  The actors and actresses did much a good job!  I really loved Cheryl ""Pepsii"" Riley. The sister can sing! And Donna Stewart did a very good job as Diana.  I remember her in ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" as Maylee.  Seeing Cheryl ""Pepsii"" Riley in this movie along with the previous ones ""Madea Goes To Jail"" & ""Class Reunion"" and her singing on ""Diary Of A Mad Black Woman"" (the movie) is always a pleasure.  I enjoyed Donna Stewart (Diana) and her husband Greg Stewart (Terry) actually portray husband & wife in this comedy.  And Anthony Grant (Troy) whew! The brother can act and sing! LaVan Davis (Poppy) is so funny, he did an outstanding job!  I still be rolling in laughter when he does the prayer over the food.  Demetria McKinney (Trina)
portrayal of the villianess (the tramp) was excellent!  Tyler Perry picked the perfect cast. Beverly Faulks (Janice) who had a small part made an impact on me.  She also did the background vocals with Christy Collins (Chico on ""Madea Goes To Jail""). If anyone who hasn't got ""Madea Goes To Jail"" buy it and listen to Christy as she sings "" Jesus Loves Me"".
She did much a good job singing that song that Tyler Perry's mom loved it and so did I. Cordell Moore (Mike)who portrayed the husband of Sheila (Cheryl ""Pepsii"" Riley) is also very talented. This movie deals with marriage, divorce, infidelity, children and about black men who don't take care of their children like the character Cordell Moore(Mike) portrayed.  I know that all men are not like that and I'm glad Tyler Perry had Greg Stewart (Terry) portray a Christian man who got his priorities straight after his infidelity who loved his wife and family. And LaVan Davis (Poppy)really portrayed his part very well and can also sing. I really enjoyed him at the end when he sang ""He's God"". He was ministering to the audience and those who saw "" Why Did I Get Married"".  And I also admired Cheryl""Pepsii"" Riley (Sheila)when she found the strength to start over after loving a man who didn't want her (Mike)and later found happiness in a man who loved her unconditionally (Troy).Tyler Perry really touched alot about real life situations in this comedy. I watched this movie everyday and still can laugh and rejoice and what makes this movie unique is that it gives the message that no matter what problems you have, take it to the Lord!
I would highly recommend this movie and I wish that I could give it 10 stars because if I could, I absolutely would!",1172016000,2,2498,4.576233183856503

Whether you've been married for many years or are just newly married, watch this one with your beloved. You'll see parts of yourself and your spouse in this video, and you'll laugh, cry and give thanks along with the main characters.

This play addresses a lot of issues and shows that love has no dress size.  I loved seeing Donna and her husband playing together and I thought Cheryl and Tony played well together.  I think everyone should judge this play without comparing it to other Madea plays; this has a message of it's own.  Buy it, it's addictive.",1156291200,2,427,4.234567901234568

Since then I've been hooked on Tyler Perry's works and I love the many pearls of wisdom sprinkled throughout his plays and films. I really enjoy Why Did I Get MArried, I watch it over and over. I think the show is strong enough on it's own that it doesn't even need Madea's character. The singing and acting are great. The father is my favorite. His supper prayer is fabulous. Tyler Perry is a genious and extremely talented. He has taken his works to a new level and a new audience. It may not suit everyone's taste but I'm sold. GREAT VIDEO.

She carries the suit well and makes you believe that it is her body not just a suit.  I laughed and enjoyed myself with this one.,1154476800,,284,3.9298245614035086
2557512,5,B000FA57JE,I thought that the movie pointed out some crucial points that everyone should consider before getting married.

2557513,5,B000FA57JE,"Funny and sad at the same time. Marriage vows are for better or worse, it is unbelievable that so many spouses forget that when the other persons physical appearance changes. Why do we get married? Is it because the other person looks a certain way, if that's the reason, you need to make it perfectly clear to the other person that if things change so will your relationship. Hooray that the wife did not give up on love and lost the weight for herself and was not bitter in the end.",1154044800,6,484,4.329670329670329
2557514,5,B000FA57JE,very good play.  excellent singing and plot. I was looking for the play along time was little put down because kelly price was one of the main character.  She was weak in acting so she must did not improve but her singing is out of this world may be that why tyler went with cheryl pepsi r. but they didn't even sing kelly song like in the play but this play still it wonderful.,1154044800,,378,4.094594594594595
2557515,5,B000FA57JE,"I also, truly loved this play and enjoyed it very much.  Having been married for 28 years to a man whom I loved and adored more than life itself and a man who left me for another woman after 28 years of marriage find it very narrow minded in the minds of those who left reviews that ONLY speak of those married or thinking about marriage.  It is a very touching play and certainly touched my heart also but don't forget about those who were not so fortunate and left behind to make a new life of their own and is not always such an easy thing to do to find another partner when one has spoken the vows ""till death do us part"".",1152576000,,626,4.040322580645161
2557516,5,B000FA57JE,"I loved it.  I love anything Tyler Perry does, though, so there's no real suprise there.  This play was written extremely well and the characters were well developed.

The play was about a couple's retreat and friends getting together and enjoying their spouses.  My favorite character was Diana, because I promise I've done some of the things she talks about having done to a cheating man :o) and because she's such an honest character.  I didn't really like Sheila's character when she was first introduced to us, because in my opinion after 3 kids a woman becomes strong enough to stand up for herself.  But, once she had her spiritual and physical transformation and make over, I was really proud of her.

Watching this movie will make you think about things that you take for granted and make you evaluate forgiveness and the true power of love.  I would recommend this to anyone in a committed, long term relationship.",1152576000,8,924,4.767295597484277
2557517,5,B000FA57JE,"Tyler Perry has done it again, I wasn't sure I would like the play as much without any of the original characters from the Madea plays, but I was certainly pleasantly surprised.  This was a true portrayal of the ups and downs of marriage.  It spoke to the hard work a good marriage takes.  It was a story of forgiveness, redemption, reconciliation, recognizing your self worth and starting over.  Cheryl ""Pepsi"" Riley was pheonomenal and her song about choosing a man without God's guidance being more than a sin was so accurate it touched my heart.  I can't wait to tell others in my church about this play, married and those waiting to be married will certainly benefit from the message of this play.",1152576000,9,702,4.629032258064516
2557518,5,B000FA57JE,"Tyler Perry is a phenomenal writer.  This play will make you laugh, cry and most of all, think.  The actors are outstanding and as always Tyler Perry keeps it real.  Donna Stewart (Diana) steals the show.  Her character is a true friend and I love the way she sticks up for Sheila and the fact that she doesn't pretend to be perfect.  Sheila's transformation is great; not only her physical transformation but her spiritual transformation.  The character of Mike is expertly played.  This character is a perfect example of an egotistical male who doesn't appreciate his supportive wife until she is gone.  I have met so many women like Trina that it is scary.

The male characters in the play are not one-dimensional.  They are not perfect but the ""good"" men are loving, humorous and supportive.  Tyler Perry's message is clear:  If you keep God first and have humor, love and most of all, commitment in your marriage, you will be able to work through your problems.

Needless to say, this is my favorite Tyler Perry play.",1152489600,14,1022,4.706214689265536

Comedy and spirituality are two things in life in which I am very fond of. This particular play is about marriage, family, friends, and betrayal. It reminded me so much of my own family. This play not only made me laugh but it also made me cry. Me and my mom we're able to connect on this play many years ago and even though she is no longer here on earth It is a joyful thing that I can still find laughter in something we both loved to watch together.
