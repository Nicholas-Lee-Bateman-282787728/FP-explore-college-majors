1249240,4,B000022TRV,"I agree with another reviewer that the scene where Babar's mother is killed is a little disturbing. However, it is still relatively mild compared to the more violent themes in the other Babar video (""Babar The Movie""). My 2-year old doesn't seem too bothered by it. Just watch it together with your child a few times to make sure they know that Babar is OK but don't make a big deal of it. The rest of the movie seems to be essentially from Babar books, strung together as a series of stories. The music is good--not fabulous but way more pleasant for adults than Barney or the Wiggles. All in all, I would recommend this for kids 2-4 years with no reservations.",1108080000,17,662,4.434426229508197
1249241,4,B000022TRV,"Of course in typical Disney fashion the mom has to die for the story to move on...we skip that scene of course as well as one where the animals are at ""war""...overall I wouldn't have gotten this but it was a gift so hey, free is free.  Not one of my son's most favorite (right now we are watching Shrek ad nasueam) but still cute.",1013558400,13,330,4.076923076923077
1249242,2,B000022TRV,"My husband and 2 year old daughter watched this together and there were some parts that were definitely scary for her.  The death of Babar's mom, a scary dream sequence and someone getting bit by a snake.  She has not wanted to watch it again.  She says it is scary and doesn't like it.
The books seem to be on a better level for her.  She prefers milder videos like, ""Maisy, ""Kipper"", ""The Wiggles"" and ""The Hungry Caterpillar"".",1010620800,15,429,4.461538461538462
1249243,5,B000022TRV,"My 2 year old loves this video, and will actually sit through the whole thing (which says a lot because it's about 90 minutes and it's not Elmo or Barney).  It's very entertaining, musical, colorful, fast-paced, and of course has a happy ending.  The only part I didn't like was in the beginning when Babar and his mother are playing in the jungle and she gets shot and killed by a hunter.  Babar runs away to avoid being shot too, and winds up in the city.  Happily, there's no carrying on or prolonging the sadness, but why do the mothers always get killed in these movies?",1009756800,3,575,4.39622641509434
1249244,5,B000022TRV,"We are thrilled with the DVD version of Babar-King of the Elephants. My 20 month old was so happy to see one of his favorite book characters come to life. Every part of the production is done with such style. The animation is calm and pleasant, the music is toe-tapping and the voices are fun and lively. I find the DVD chapters well divided and useful if you need to skip over the sad parts - a great convenience to keep the movie seamless for toddlers.

The DVD makes for pleasant repeat watchings for parents. The story is well-paced and reworks the original books in an interesting way.

We hope HBO releases more Babar episodes from this director on DVD. A job well done!",1004659200,3,676,4.443548387096774
1249245,5,B000022TRV,"Me and my godchild love it.  I remember reading Babar as a child and now I love watching the movie as an adult.  There is the most wonderful fun song in this movie possibly titled, ""I can take good care of me.""  I can't get the song out of my head.  The artwork looks just like the book which is neat in a historical sense.  The story values family, friends, and community.  There are a couple of scenes some children may find disturbing, including; Babar's mother's death, a fire where someone is in danger, a baby almost being eaten by a crocodile, and a nightmare with witches and spooky creatures.  My godchild who is only two was not bothered by it, though I know some children may be.  I definetly recommend it.  I think they have a good price on it too.",1004140800,,760,4.295774647887324
1249246,5,B000022TRV,My three and half year old daughter loves elephants and loves this video.  It provides a nice story line and is very well produced.  It's more interesting than other videos for this age group and not as over produced as the Disney movies.  It's just right!  She now wants to live in Elephant  City.,954547200,14,298,4.444444444444445
1249247,5,B000022TRV,"The kids (6 and 2) love it, as do my wife and I. The film takes Babar from infancy to late middle age, with excitement and gorgeous animation in between.  A master's choice for any family's collection of childrens' DVDs.  The soundtrack ought to be released on its own--it's that good.",947721600,19,285,4.568627450980392
1249248,4,B000022TRV,"This movie is good, especially if your son or daughter LOVES Babar. However, the mother of Babar gets killed by a hunter in the very first 10 minutes of the movie. My son still loved it, he didn't cry or get overwhelmed; It did however, open up a lot of questions about why Babar mom got hurt. So be prepared for that, but otherwise as the story goes on, it is the story of Babar and Celeste which my son watches over and over and over again, until he almost knows the words by heart.",1280880000,,484,4.105263157894737
1249249,5,B000022TRV,"I purchased this DVD so my 2 year old grandson could watch it at my house.  He enjoys watching the Babar stories on On Demand.  He loved this show!  The music, the story, the content were all wonderful!  It's sad when mother dies, but we talked about it a little and he was fine.  He actually liked seeing the scary dream and asked to watch it again. H-m-m-m-  Great purchase!!",1250726400,,377,4.314285714285714
1249250,2,B000022TRV,"My advice: either rent this movie or check it out from the library, do not buy it, and I would recommend do not even watch it as there are so many other better movies!  The only redeeming part of the movie is the soundtrack.  The movie version of Babar follows the book, originally written in the 1930s.  The general plot revolves around Babar's life, which is very happy until suddenly his mom is killed by a hunter with a shotgun, he gets lost, and somehow wanders into a city in Europe (from Africa!?!?!?) where he is adopted by a rich old white woman who pays for his new clothes and teaches him to read, do math, etc, (""civilzes"" him).  He then goes back to the jungle, becomes king, and proceeds to build a city and society similar to what he had experienced.  I felt the message here was that white western civilization is superior, and that by adopting the characteristics of the West you become civilzed.  The whole story is very similar to the prevailing thinking of the time, that by educating the elites from developing countries they would then go back and created ""enlightened"" societies.  What actually happened, of course, was failed experiments in development as these leaders often became despots.  As I watched the Rhinos rampaging through the jungle destroying everything in their path as they waged war against the elephants, I could not help but think about how endangered they currently are, and how misunderstood they were at the time the Babar book was written.  It also disturbed me that the death of Babar's mother is never examined again: that her head or tusks was likely mounted in someone's parlor in that very civilization that Babar was trying to copy.",1229731200,,1685,4.723549488054608
1249251,5,B000022TRV,"I'm a music teacher and used this to help prepare the kids for a Poulenc concert.  The story follows the original quite closely and the music, though not the Poulenc, is very good.  The students really enjoyed it.",1225411200,,213,4.578947368421052
1249252,2,B000022TRV,"This is a wonderful, gentle, sweet video of young Babar.  It starts out calm and beautiful.  The music and voice over is wonderful.  But then, there's the shotgun death of his mother while he's riding on her back.  The hunter then trains his gun on Babar, who manages to escape.  My almost-3-year-old keeps asks, where's his mother?  What happened to his mother?  Other than this scene, and references to how when Babar thinks of his mother he's sad, I love the video.  But I don't think the killing scene and reference is appropriate in a video aimed at such young kids.",1221091200,,571,4.584158415841584
1249253,3,B000022TRV,"Since our daughter loves her Babar books, we decided to buy her this DVD.
I often find even DVDs for kids too hectic and fast-moving, but this one is a pleasant surprise: The animation is very well crafted, the story moves along smoothly without too much ""action"" and dialogue which can easily overwhelm smaller kids. My daughter enjoys especially the songs that are beautifully integrated.

However, the scene in which Babar's mother dies and the war with the rhinos are so drawn out, that my daughter asked to turn the TV off. I have no idea, why these upsetting scenes were given so much more importance than they have in the book.

The other disappointment was that the movie entirely skips Babar's travels with his new wife Celeste! This is my daughter's favored part of the story, and I'm sure she's not the only one.",1200355200,,823,4.6689655172413795
1249254,5,B000022TRV,"As children, both my daughter and I loved the Babar books, and I was delighted to find this video for my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter.  It is absolutely the books brought to life, and she never tires of watching it.
I would highly recommend this video to anyone with children 2 years old or more.",1196467200,,296,4.381818181818182
1249255,5,B000022TRV,"So few movies are appropriate for sensitive little kids, toddler to preschooler age, that we only have a few DVDs for our 2.5 year old.

This DVD is a gem!  Perfect for his age, with only two scenes that need parental interpretation (Babar's mother is shot in one, and Babar battles evil spirits in the other).

A perfect introduction to Babar and the book series.",1193443200,,364,4.569230769230769
1249256,5,B000022TRV,"If your child loves animals, this is a perfect video for her/him. But beware that like Bambi, Babar's mother dies in the begining...We always stay around to skip this part. Everything else is just gorgeous.",1192233600,,206,4.914285714285715
1249257,5,B000022TRV,"Babar was my favorite move when I was younger.  Now I watch it and still enjoy it.  As for the whole mother dying, well it teaches the small ones that life is short, and don't take things for granted.  Also teaches them that death is apart of life, and bad things happen for a reason like with all the bad luck towards the end of the movie.  The old woman getting bitten by the snake, the fire in Cornilious house, and the crocadile in the lake.  When ever I finally have kids they will watch it and learn from it.",1162771200,,514,4.1

7915306,5,B000022TRV,"Delightful, full of fun for all ages,  my granddaughters, five and eight years old loved it.
As for me, it reminded me of my childhood, when we read the Babar books, written
by Jean de Brunhof to pay for his sanatorium when he suffered from TB. HIs son
took over after him and continued with great adventures of the vegetarian tribe,
who ate wonderful soup of bananas in chocolate!",1363651200,3,381,4.521739130434782

7915309,1,B000022TRV,"My two boys 2, and 4, were watching this together and they were enjoying the animals in the beginning scene, then a shotgun comes out and Babar's mother is killed right beneath him. For the next 10 minutes my kids kept asking what happened to the mom. It was very disturbing!! I couldn't believe they did that. It took me about 10 minutes to pick my jaw up from off the floor and then I shut the movie off and suggested we watch something less violent. In this day and age can we try and preserve the innocence of children. I will never be watching any of the Babar movies again, I was so disturbed by this film!",1336089600,,612,4.194915254237288
7915310,1,B000022TRV,"I thought Babar - King of the Elephants was a weak DVD, not particularly 'fun,' unless strife is
considered a worthwhile way for children to spend their time.  My grandchild Juliet, age 5, was distressed by the gratuitous violence in the film, and we had to turn off the DVD.",1323561600,,275,4.5
7915311,5,B000022TRV,"I recently watched this several times with our 3 year old twin grandsons.  We all just loved it.
I remember the Barbar books from my childhood and they were early favorites of mine.  I particularly
loved the kindness and generosity and good will in this film.  After a series of dangers, Barbar
had a dream where an ugly fellow, ""misfortune"" was taunting him, and this was dispelled by some
cute ""elephant angels"" who came down, singing, with love rays from Heaven.  This was a great opportunity
for me to point out to our grandchildren how good is more powerful than evil.  I plan on buying all of
the books for our grandsons for their fourth birthday.  I am delighted to be re-introduced to these
timeless stories.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babar-King-Of-The-Elephants/dp/B00002EQ06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babar - King Of The Elephants</a>",1295308800,,888,5.58955223880597
