don't waste your money or time on the horrible creation. I truely think i put more time in this review than the guys that made this piece of junk. Now i am left with the choise of burning it or trowing it out the window.",1206316800,5,363,3.9863013698630136
8207646,2,B000T2VEBS,"I bought this dvd with some level of hope, but no!, No Hope for this. I highly recommend you save your money and send the author a condolence letter about how dead this dvd/music really is.

Amazon should refund my money and listen to this dvd for a couple days. They will be more disappointed than me. I won't buy any more music from Amazonoly bad.

EEEEkkkk!",1203811200,4,360,4.358208955223881
8207647,1,B000T2VEBS,"I had high expectations of this HD-DVD that claims ""Music Experience In 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" and was very disappointed.
Cons:
1. The recording has a lot of low frequency (bass)distortion, most noticeable on the first song.
2. The music is not performed by an orchestra and not even by a group, it is mostly just a keyboard.
3. The musicians are not identified, maybe because it is just one.
Pro:
A. The selection of songs is very good.
B. The Pictures of NY, Paris, etc. are beautiful.
In conclusion, I would not recommend this HD-DVD and wish Amazon would take it back.",1192233600,12,578,4.676470588235294
8207648,4,B000T2VEBS,"I did love this DVD.  Maybe because I'm so starved for HD Jazz content.  The only problem with this DVD was that it doesn't say who performed the songs.  I think it is because the tunes were programmed in a synthesizer.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds great, except the horns were clearly electronic and played on a keyboard.  I have a feeling all of the ""instruments"" were done the same way.

The DVD plays instrumentals of jazz classics in DTS along with High Def photos of locations around the world.  There are a lot of city shots of New York (even the World Trade Towers), Paris, and other spots.  I would recommend this to jazz lovers and HD audio enthusiasts as well as people that like high def photos of different cities around the world.",1189987200,6,746,4.4338235294117645
