2332358,2,B0009X75CO,THE STORY WAS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR A MANTAN MORELAND MOVIE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER HAD NOT PARTS OF THE MOVIE BEEN OF SUCH POOR QUALITY - PARTS WERE ALMOST ALL DARK GREY WITH THE IMAGES BARELY DISCERABLE.,1153785600,3,209,4.384615384615385
2332359,4,B0009X75CO,"Just to show you (and myself) how little I know, the character of Michael Shayne, created by author Brett Halliday, has been around quite a while, appearing in over 50 novels, numerous films in the 40s, had his own mystery magazine, appeared in three radio programs, had a television series, and even his own comic book...and I never heard of him until last night, when I watched this film, titled Dressed to Kill (1941).  Directed by Eugene Forde (Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise, Michael Shayne: Private Detective), the film stars Lloyd Nolan (Bataan, The Lemon Drop Kid, Peyton Place) as private detective Mike Shayne, one of seven times Nolan would appear on the silver screen as the character in the early 40s (Hugh Beaumont would later reprise the role for PRC in the mid to late 40s in five films).  Also appearing is William `Uncle Charley' Demarest (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, ""My Three Sons""), Mary Beth Hughes (The Ox-Bow Incident, I Accuse My Parents), Henry Daniell (The Great Dictator, Jane Eyre), Erwin Kalser (Stalag 17), Virginia Brissac (Rebel Without a Cause), Milton Parsons (Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome), Ben Carter (Born to Sing), Mantan Moreland (King of the Zombies), and William 'Whitey' Benedict (Ghosts on the Loose, Bowery Buckaroos).

As the film begins we see Mike Shayne (Nolan) buying a suit (on credit) as he's planning to marry his long time girlfriend and showgirl Joanne La Marr (Hughes) that very day.  As Mike walks through the streets to meet up with his fiance, we get the sense he's pretty well known about town, as everyone he sees has a hello along with wisecrack regarding to his impending nuptials.  Mike arrives at the hotel, hooks up with Joan (check out her expression as he presents the ring), and just as they're preparing to leave, there's a scream from one of the rooms upstairs.  Upon investigating, Mike finds two dead bodies, one being producer Louis Lathrop, the other his girlfriend/actress Desiree Vance, both murdered in an apparent double homicide (the maid, who found them, was the one who screamed).  The pair evidently met their fate during a dinner party the previous night, and Mike now sees an opportunity to make a little dough as he first contacts a newspaper (they offer him some moolah if he can identify the murderer and give them the scoop), prior to calling the police (private investigators have to seize their opportunities where they can).  While waiting for the authorities to arrive, Mike begins collecting clues giving the joint the once over, and finally Inspector Pierson (Demarest) makes the scene.  After a little give and take, Mike takes the show on the road as the suspects begin coming out of the woodwork (along with a body or two), and he even manages to squeeze out another paying gig out of the homicide, as he's hired by Lathrop's wife (the couple separated some time ago) to solve the case, which would clear her boyfriend Julian Davis (Daniell), as his past dealings with the deceased seem to point to him as the prime suspect.  Things get a little crazy, as Mike has to stay one step ahead of the police, while also avoiding getting whacked himself as the killer knows Mike is onto him (or her).

I'll tell you what, it's been awhile since I've seen a film where the wisecracks and smart remarks come as fast and furious as they do here, the ongoing gag being Mike constant distractions from what he had originally intended to do that day, which was get married.  It's like watching one of those Thin Man movies, with William Powell and Myrna Loy, only sans the suave and sophisticated sensibilities.  Honestly, I was expecting a more straightforward detective drama, but I certainly wasn't disappointed with what I got.  My favorite zinger comes from when Mike's fiance Joanne nearly destroys one of the clues, on accident, and Mike replies in frustration to her, ""The stork that brought you should have been arrested for peddling dope!"".  The movie is filled with choice bits of dialog, all flowing with a natural ease from the situations and characters.  The actual mystery portion of the story is fairly interesting, but what I really enjoyed was the characters.  Nolan plays his role like he was born for it, a streetwise, crafty, sometimes devious fellow who manages to keep one or two clues ahead of the police to ensue his much needed payday once he solves the case.  He's smart, a little rough around the edges, and perceptive enough to get what he needs to keep the trail warm, following up leads.  The funniest aspect for me was how Shayne would jerk the police around, enough to throw them off the trail just long enough for him to get what he needs prior to their finally getting back on track.  Demarest is a riot as the gruff, seemingly capable, tenacious and gravely voiced Inspector Pierson, suffering the constant aggravation of always having to play catch up to Shayne (Shayne often plays dirty), along with being beleaguered with incompetents.  And then there's Henry Daniell, who played the slightly foppish Julian Davis, a cultured performer/dolt who chaffs against Shayne's unpretentious methods and straightforward demeanor, but soon begins to realize Shayne maybe the only one interested in clearing his name.  The direction by Forde is strong and focused, as the story zips along, never outstaying its welcome.  This are a couple sequences features a few stereotypical caricatures that some may find offensive (an Asian butler and two, African American stage hands), but when viewed in the proper perspective, they shouldn't spoil the movie.  There's one scene in particular where Mike gets two African American stage hands (played by Ben Carter and Mantan Moreland) to help him re-enact the double murder (offering them five bucks apiece), and the men display exaggerated wide-eyed, nervous, and jittery characterizations, once they learn they're going to where the murders actually took place.  Some might feel uncomfortable, or even offended, but keep in mind things were as they were back when, and we've since come a long way in terms of education, understanding, and acceptance.  I'm not trying to justify what was done in the past, but only to say we shouldn't judge things without trying to understand the perceptions of the time.  The scene did end with a particularly odd line, as once Mike got the information he needed and released the men of their obligation, the two were about to bolt without getting paid, to which Mike stated ""Hey, wait a minute!  You'll never get rich that way."", and one of the men replied ""Boss, right now I could make myself a fortune hiring myself out as a vibrator!""  I can only think the meaning of the word had a different connotation back then as it does now...

The fullscreen picture (1.33:1) looks very clean and sharp, and the Dolby Digital audio, offered in both mono and stereo, comes through clearly.  There aren't any special features, other than a couple of unrelated Fox Home Entertainment DVDs previews for the films The Doctor and the Devils (1985) and The Cabinet of Caligari (1962).

2332360,5,B0009X75CO,"This is a movie for those of us who loved curling up with a good old murder mystery on a rainy Saturday afternoon long ago. Unfortunately this is the only Michael Shayne that I can find in print. I don't know why because it is much better than most of the later Charlie Chans that you can buy in an expensive set (a waste of money). Lloyd Nolan stars as the wise-cracking detective who would rather solve a double murder than get married on his wedding day. The mystery has enough suspects to keep you guessing and the ending is satisfying. Another plus is William Demarest as the police chief. Demarest adds to any movie, here playing the cop who has seen it all while adding to the comedy at the same time. The DVD transfer is very good, especially considering the price, but there are no special features except plugs for other movies. Still I know what I'll be watching the next rainy Saturday afternoon.",1126310400,32,908,4.475903614457831
2332391,5,B0009X75CO,"I have a fantasy where the major studios take great care to release their old movies on DVD  (even B-Movies).
The dream started to come true back in 2007 when Fox Home Video released the ""Michael Shayne Mystery Collection, Volume One"".
But it was not to be.
There never was a Volume Two.
Instead Fox released the remaining three films starring Lloyd Nolan in dribs and drabs.
The situation is even worse with the five Hugh Beaumont films - only one is available on DVD.

Back in 2007, four of the seven films were packaged in a two DVD boxed set.
All films had subtitles, and the box included several interesting featurettes about Michael Shayne.
I have been patiently waiting for Volume Two, but it is not to be.
Instead we have had to buy individual DVDs of:

**** ""TIME TO KILL"" has not been released yet, though Amazon has assigned a stock index number to it:
ASIN: B005QCH5MI
Apparently it will be a DVD-R without subtitles.
Under ""DVDs & Movies"", type ""Time to Kill 1942"" on the  Amazon search bar.
""Time to Kill"" may be the most interesting film in the series.
It was adapted from a Raymond Chandler Philip Marlowe novel (""The High Window""), two years before Marlowe debuted on film under his own name (in ""Murder My Sweet"", 1944)
Hard to believe, but in the 1940s, author Brett Halliday outsold Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett as a writer of detective fiction.
Wise-cracking Private Eye Michael Shayne was featured in 69 novels published between 1939 and 1977.

The seven Lloyd Nolan movies were produced by Twentieth Century Fox's B-Movie division
The Fox series ended in 1942, but four years later it was revived by PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) for a series of five films with Hugh Beaumont (better known as Beaver Cleaver's father).
PRC was strictly Poverty Row.
Even Monogram looked down on PRC.
The Lloyd Nolan movies are great fun, and even the Hugh Beaumont PRC films are not without their charms.
You just have to like B-Movies.

2332392,4,B0009X75CO,"Well, this isn't the one where Angie Dickinson gets naked or where Basil Rathbone messes about with music boxes.

When you think of B-movie gumshoes that plied their trade circa the 1930s and '40s, odds are Michael Shayne won't be first to be dredged up in your memory. Other, more eminent gents of the potboiler - the Saint, the Falcon, Bulldog Drummond, Charlie Chan - tend to spring to mind first. And maybe it's partly because the guy most identified with playing Michael Shayne didn't much look like a matinee idol nor did he look as striking as Warner Oland. To me, Lloyd Nolan will always be Michael Shayne, never mind that greater film success came later on in his career - The House on 92nd Street (1945), The Street with No Name (1948), Peyton Place (1957) - when he'd moved on from the shady shamus.

I say ""shady shamus"" because that's what I remember most about Shayne, that and how lighthearted his murder mysteries tended to be. Shayne wasn't exactly a stickler for the rules. His sneaky sleuthing techniques often crossed up the coppers, undermined their official investigation. The plot to Dressed to Kill (1941): As Shayne and his stage actress sweetheart, Joanne La Marr (Mary Beth Hughes), step out to get hitched, our shamus is diverted by a scream and stumbles across two murdered bodies dressed up in costumes from a 25-year-old play. Shayne remarks, ""Well, whoever staged this little melodrama certainly had cracked chimes in their belfry."" And maybe you can give him some slack - after all, he's only looking to bolster his honeymoon stakes - but Shayne doesn't hesitate to give the local newsrag the scoop (for $100), promising to give the reporters a five minute head start before he calls the coops. He works out a deal with the paper in which he gets an extra $400 if he solves the murder. He then proceeds to casually handle objects at the scene of the crime. He pockets evidence. He pilfers cigars. He proves to be not averse to witness tampering. And, later, when bumbling Inspector Pierson (William Demarest) threatens to screw up Shayne's lucrative scheme, our guy doesn't hesitate to lay him out cold. So it's a good thing Shayne, as played by Nolan, is a likable guy. There's this affable roughhouse vibe that allows us to dismiss Shayne's unorthod- no, illegal methods. It somehow all seems like in good fun.

Michael Shayne remains hard-boiled throughout, but Dressed to Kill embroils him in many moments of levity, and Nolan is terrific at playing it light yet tough. Dressed to Kill, third of seven films by Nolan as Shayne, borrows from that old trope of the ace detective about to get married only to have a case distract him. They did it to the Falcon and umpteenth times to Bulldog Drummond. At least Perry Mason actually got to marry Della Street before a case cuts their honeymoon short (The Case of the Velvet Claws). Anyway, maybe it's an ominous harbinger of sorts that, as the movie opens, everyone seems to be all up in his business: ""Say, I hear you're getting married."" Throughout the film, you can see Shayne's girl getting more and more fed up.

In 1939 writer Brett Halliday created Micahel Shayne, but Dressed to Kill is based on another writer Richard Burke's vaudeville whodunit, The Dead Take No Bows. The mystery aspect, concerning suspects in the theaterical circle, is pretty tepid. What makes it a such a good watch are the cast's lively performances and the droll comedy injected. Credit character actor William Demarest whose pratfall game is strong in this one and is priceless as the fumbling, all the time cranky police inspector. Throw in some misdirection with a red herring or two and a bit of hide and seek thru secret passageways that adjoin a theater to an apartment building. This sucker runs around 75 minutes, short enough that the pace is brisk and the patter snappy and the clue-chasing doesn't much slow down. A pleasing pulp detective mystery with a killer I didn't figure out.",1467590400,,3959,4.766763848396502

2332442,3,B0009X75CO,"Truth. I like my black and white film and literary detectives all filled to the brim with noir-ish attributes. You know like the ultra-cool Sam Spade in the film adaptation of Dashiell Hammetts The Maltese Falcon where it was touch and go whether he would let that femme fatale off the hook and spent the rest of his life looking over his shoulder to see whether she would put a slug or two in him just for kicks or just cut his losses and turn her and her stuff that dreams were made of notion over to the coppers to take the fall, to take the big step off if they could very get a jury to squeeze her pretty little head. Or the world-weary and wary Philip Marlowe in the film adaptation of Raymond Chandlers The Big Sleep trying to paste together an old mans last requests, try to find an old reprobate guy, try to keep a cheap hood from cleaning up the old mans fortune, yeah, and grab some bad guys in the bargain. Or any of the several other Chandler crime novels that have been turned into film.

Yeah, I like my detective guys chasing after windmills for the good of the cause and money places a distance second to that pursuit, like them willing to take a few hits on the noggin or a stray bullet or two for that same good cause, and of course I want my guys to go right to the very edge with some forgetful double-crossing trigger-happy  femme fatale and then walk away without a murmur when justice has to rear its head even if that means many lonely winter nights alone thinking about the vagaries of love. So it was a little disconcerting, made me a little ticked off really, to have a black and white film detective (oops, private investigator as he preferred to be called), Michael Shayne, hustling to solve first two murders and eventually three murders for filthy lucre. To not only not be in pursuit of some hot off the press femme but to be planning on the very day of first murders to get married, get married against all wise advise, to go way out of his way to avoid taking a few hits or a random slug, and worse, worse than all of that is that he takes everything with a certain detached humor and nonchalance giving the profession a bad name, making everybody think these PIs are nothing peep-hole peepers or  repo guys in the film under review, 1941s  Dressed to Kill.

But then I got to thinking about what a film or crime novel private investigator is supposed to do, why he in the end can pursue his profession with his head held up high, can blow off the cynics who think he or she lives under some rock when not looking through keyholes, and that is to outsmart, easily outsmart the coppers, the public coppers, New York Citys finest in this film set around the environs of Broadway and peopled with guys and dolls who could have come straight out of Damon Runyons pen. Yeah, every self-respecting PI, and Michael Shayne is no exception lives to have the whole case wrapped up and tied with a ribbon and still have time to see a Broadway show, make bets with his bookmaker, file his nails or have them filed, empty a bottle of bottom drawer cheap low-shelf scotch and filch half the evidence which was laying around, while the cops are still scratching their heads and finishing up their coffee and crullers. And one Michael Shayne certainly does all of that, or could, almost baiting the public cops to beat him to the punch in the process.

Here is the way Shayne sewed the thing up without any heavy breathing (and in the process remained a black and white film pure detective unmarried and unattached to worry those long winter nights alone and think about the vagaries of the love game when his honey takes a powder on him with some other Joe, and good riddance). Lothrop, a has-been producer and owner of the Broadway hotel where Shaynes bride to be lives, gets gruesomely murdered in his suite along with an old time flame, Desiree and nobody can figure out how it happened since the set-up looked like a murder-suicide by one of the two. But Shayne after a few minutes is wise to that caper. Figures out that the murderer knew a thing or two about set-ups himself by use of a hairpin trigger for one while killing the other. Nice work. So Shayne works his way through the set-up staying one step, no about five steps, ahead of the coppers who are assigned to the case. Everything point to an inside job, or somebody who knew how to get in and out without being seen (although the murderer it turns out was seen and was being blackmailed by an ex-actor on the outs with Lothrop. But the big question was who would have had the motive to set-up such a weird set of killings and then subsequently murder Lothrops maid (an old theater flame of his who the killer thought knew too much). Once Shayne did a simple little test on one of the suspects it was all downhill from there. And of course along the way he is wise-cracking and setting up red herrings with abandon. And those cops were still scratching their heads and waiting for their orders of coffee and the last we saw of Shayne who will before be back in the private investigator saddle again, one jump, no, four jumps ahead of the local constabulary. Yeah, not Sam or Philip but that is about right.",1420416000,,5192,4.397502601456816

Michael Shayne buys a new suit in preparation for his marriage. ""It could happen to anyone."" His bride Joan works in show business. Mike hears a woman scream in the hotel; a maid found a dead woman and Louis Lathrop in their rooms. Mike tips a newspaper for a bounty, then the police. [The value of a dollar dates this movie.] The dead couple were dressed in costumes from a hit show from years ago. [Note those rifles on the wall.] Louis was shot with a rifle, Desire Vance with a pistol. Mike eats some of the leftover food. [He touches things to contaminate the crime scene!] The humor adds to the story. There is a special entrance from the theater next door; more than one. Otto heard a woman last night before he left. Connie Earl calls about her father. Mike tells Emily the maid the police want to talk to her. Mike talks to Miss Earl, who tells about Julian Davis (who embezzled $28,000 from Lathrop).

Mike meets Mrs. Lathrop at his flat. He offers them a chance to help them by investigating the murders for a price. Mike brings two janitors up to the hotel suite. Will he try to recreate the crime? [The humor dates this movie, some may object.] A composer also does magic tricks. Mike learns of another suspect. He visits Desire Vance's flat to find the Inspector there. Then he goes to Julian's flat to warn and hide him. Is someone after him? An old letter has a clue! Who called the police with a tip about Davis? There is a third exit from Lathrop's flat - to the rooms below. This resident won't talk, and left a message. Is it true? Mike promises to crack the case. The police take him in, they share news. Can Mike deliver the murderer at 9PM? A man drags a body on a rug. Otto talks to Mike, who explains how the murders were done. We learn about the solution and the motive. Later the murderer boasts about it, and who was next. The police arrive to clear up this crime. Mike gets a singing telegram: ""Goodbye"".

This is a pretty good murder mystery with comedy. Usually I don't like this mixture. Some of the jokes would not be done today, or with other actors. This movie follows the convention of having the murderer as someone who is in the background. Can you spot him or her beforehand? Do the jokes about marriage send a message about the script writer?

2332497,4,B0009X75CO,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film streaming from IMDb, and thus cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the individually packaged disc. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

In an effort to pursue my new-found infatuation with the actress Mary Beth Hughes, I turned from Inner Sanctum to DRESSED TO KILL, which seemed to promise a leading role for Ms. Hughes, as she actually gets second billing here. Unfortunately, there's too little for her to do, and she spends most of the time waiting in the wings - literally. Despite my disappointment with Ms. Hughes screen-time, I have to say that I really enjoyed this film, expecting nothing much, but finding a slick, well-made crime story that had me laughing out loud in spots, and genuinely intrigued at the mystery.

A few of the issues I have with older films - especially private-eye flicks - is that the patter can get so snappy it doesn't seem real anymore, and the tension/comedy relief scenes can just be silly. I thought DRESSED TO KILL avoided both of these pitfalls - the dialog isn't overdone and what is meant to be funny really is.

Well, if we don't get Ms. Hughes, at least we get Lloyd Nolan as Private Eye Michael Shayne, who might not be as pretty, but who certainly carries the film. Mike, who starts out the film trying to get married (to the elusive Ms Hughes), ends up in the middle of a double homicide instead. From then on, his dance card is filled out by the local police inspector (William Demerest - Uncle Charlie from MY THREE SONS - in a excellent comedic turn), disgruntled actors, and a mystery stretching back to the first World War.

There are some minority stereotypes that are jarring to modern sensibilities, one a longish scene where two African-American stagehands assist (unwillingly) Mike as he reenacts the murder scene. The viewer's previous experience with such scenes is the best guidance - although one of the stagehands has the funniest line in the film.

Except for the above-mentoned caveat, the is quite a gem of a film and recommended for all fans of films from this era.",1346803200,,2110,4.7073170731707314

""Dressed to Kill"" was the name of a Sherlock Holmes movie with Basil R, and that's the movie I received... but, I thought I was buying the Michael Shayne movie with Lloyd Nolan - that was what was advertised, though the photo on this page says otherwise. This is the first such error I have encountered out of many many purchases, so I'm not in distress. -guym",1309996800,3,441,4.325301204819277
2332499,4,B0009X75CO,"Situated next door to a burlesque theater, where Michael Shayne's girlfriend Joan is currently the star act, is the Hotel du Nord.  It is not a bad looking place and it seems well kept up, but at least one tenant disparagingly refers to it as a flophouse.  It is not its looks or upkeep that gives it that name, but its going-ons.  Why only last month, the police raided the hotel for gambling.  And then there was another time, when there were a couple of murders; Mr. Brennen, the hotel manager, was quiet upset when the police carried the bodies through the lobby.  And then there are the occasional screams ...

Michael Shayne is a private detective.  He is in a slump just now and his wallet is looking a little thin.  But Joan knows this is a great time to hitch her man, because when he is on a case, marriage is the last thing on his mind.  Today is to be their wedding day.

Mike can't get married in the suit he has, so he trade it in and makes a down payment of two dollars for a new suit.  Later, when he arrives at Joan's apartment, she asks to see the ring.  He has it!  She tries it on.  It is really going to happen, just think, in a little while it will be Mr. and Mrs. Michael Shayne!

Fortunately for Mike, if she hadn't been living in the Hotel du Nord, he would never have heard the scream ...

2332500,5,B0009X75CO,"Like the other Shayne films I've seen - those released in the boxset enigmatically called, Michael Shayne Mysteries Volume 1 (Hey 20th Century Fox! Where's volume 2?!), Dressed to Kill is a fast paced murder mystery full of humor and action. Micheal Shayne is about to finally get married to long time girlfriend and showgirl, Joanne La Marr (Mary Beth Hughes), only to be interrupted by a blood-curdling scream which sucks Mike willingly back into the detective business (only to make some dough for his new bride-to-be, of course).  There's plenty of humor, twists and turns, and mysterious passages to follow, as Mike tries to solve a bizarre double murder that may have it's roots burried deep in the dark past of a theater production troop, most of whom are dead and burried.  A+ for Micheal Shayne fans.

The quality of the print used is very nice; the blacks are deep and vivid; there appears to be almost no print damage or age-related grain; the audio is perfect.  Recommended big time.",1233360000,2,995,4.8011695906432745
2332501,4,B0009X75CO,"The title is often confused with two other films with the same moniker; the Sherlock Holmes final series entry from 1946, featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce and the 1980 Brian De Palma film.  I always wondered why they didn't include this film in the box set of Michael Shayne collection.  It was one of the most enjoyable stories from the series.  This, and 1942's- ""The Man Who Wouldn't Die"", which is a part of the box set.  I have a feeling that there won't be any more Shayne films put out...must not have sold well enough to suit the powers that be.  It's shame, because I was looking forward to seeing the last two Shayne movies with Lloyd Nolan; ""Just Off Broadway (1942) & ""Time To Kill"", also from 1942.  It would also be nice to see the first two Shayne films when Hugh Beaumont (of ""Leave It To Beaver"" fame) took over: ""Murder Is My Business"" (1946) and ""Larceny In Her Heart (1946).",1223942400,13,902,4.4363636363636365
