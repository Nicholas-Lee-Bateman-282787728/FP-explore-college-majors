8158919,5,B000KRNMS0,"I got this mostly for a quick but effective workout for my core. I didn't know if I'd get it on this DVD but very pleased because I do. The exercises, while effective, are safe. There are no crunches as we know them. And you'll feel how effective the workout is when you're finished. It uses dynamic tension and isometrics, which I like very much.

The other workouts are equally as good. If you do 10 minutes of exercise three times a day, you're getting what you need. And making this DVD part of your day or your week will give you a big boost.

The instructor isn't a celeb trainer so she's very basic. But she does give good, clear instructions and there's nothing to distract from the workout.

Highly recommended.
