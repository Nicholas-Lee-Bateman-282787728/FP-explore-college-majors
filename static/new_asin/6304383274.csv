7869829,4,6304383274,"Love George Sanders, bought this as part of a purchase to obtain all the movies in ""The Saint"" series. Simple plot, entertaining characters - reminds me of ""The Lone Ranger"" or ""Superman,"" something you would have watched as a kid at a Saturday matinee at the local ""bijou.""  VHS tape quality overall is pretty good. The plot for ""The Saint in Palm Springs"" is a little more developed and involved than some of the other ""Saint"" movies. ""The Saint Meets the Tiger"" features another actor as the Saint, not George Sanders.  This one is OK but it is an older movie and the sound on the VHS tape I purchased was fuzzy, which probably has to do with the age of the original movie. I guess I must be a throwback or something - I like watching an old movie that you can tell is an old movie.",1367798400,,785,4.297297297297297
7869830,4,6304383274,"""The Saint in Palm Springs"" was the last Saint movie with George Saunders in the role. He made an excellent job of the Saint, and in this movie was at his witty and urbane best. Three valuable postage stamps and a series of mysteries are at the heart of this story, which reunites the Saint with his old henchman ""Pearly"" Gates. A series of clever tactics keeps the Saint leap frogging the bad guys, sometimes a step behind them, sometimes a step ahead, and as always with a beautiful woman or two involved.

""The Saint Meets the Tiger"" was the first of the Saint books, but appeared rather late in the series of movies. The Saint is following the trail of a million pounds sterling of gold stolen from a Bristol bank by a gang headed by ""the Tiger"", a criminal mastermind. Hugh Sinclair, who doesn't much look the part initially, grows on you as the Saint with his witty and confident performance. His sidekick, Horace, has been transformed from a rough retired seaman to a dapper butler. The story isn't, or course, exactly the plot of the book, but it is close enough to give you fond reminiscences of the book. The cast is very similar in most respects to the main characters in the book. One of the main differences is that the identity of the Tiger is revealed quite early in the movie, and that revelation is virtually the last event in the book.

Some of the action scenes are a bit simplistic, to the point of virtually being bungled. Yet the charm of the dialog and the heroes overcomes those deficiencies. If you like these classic old mysteries, you can do a lot worse than ""The Saint Meets the Tiger"".",1287619200,,1614,4.48639455782313
