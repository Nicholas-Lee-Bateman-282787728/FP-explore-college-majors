8256643,3,B0014Z3OEO,This DVD was purchased for my four year old son as a Christmas gift.  He was very excited to open it up because he loves anything Thomas.  The movie was described accurately by the product description and was priced very reasonably.  I would have given it five stars except compared to the other Thomas movies my son has this one didn't seem to keep his attention as much.,1229731200,,372,4.4411764705882355
