2115178,4,B0002Q81VC,"The negatives:  This video has terrible graphics, is really cheesy and as an adult you will think it's horrible.

The positives:  My 2 year old son LOVES this video.  Before watching it, I tried to teach him the alphabet, but he just wasn't interested.  After watching this almost daily for 2 weeks (told you, he LOVES it) he started recognizing letters and pretty much knew most of them.  At that point I was able to start working with him because he understood the concept. He is now 2 1/2 and knows all the letters of the alphabet, most of them in order.

The way the video is set up is they will show a large letter and a lower case letter at the top of the screen, talk about it a little, say some words that start with that letter and then have a song about the letter.  At the end they go over all the letters in order.  You will probably find yourself singing the songs from this video.  They're not good, but somehow catchy...

My son is 2 and he benefited quite a bit, however my friend saw my success with Alphabet Al and got it for her 2 year old girl... she hates it.  However, her 4 year old will watch it a little and learned some from it.

Summary:  Like 1 reviewers said, see if you can preview before you buy because each kid is different.  I would personally highly recommend this video.",1266883200,,1306,4.230769230769231
2115179,1,B0002Q81VC,"First of all, even for a child this program is boring. Second, and most important, the ""F"" in the video stands for FIRE EATER! It actually shows someone igniting a fire and blowing alcohol (I would assume) on it to make a large fireball.

Now, in their defense they tell the child not to do this at home, but that's the same as making ""G"" mean gun and shooting someone and then saying 'don't do this at home'.

Ridiculous.

Stay away from this DVD!",1191024000,,448,4.309523809523809
2115180,5,B0002Q81VC,"You can preview excerpts from this DVD online at [...]  Reading a review is one thing, but seeing it for yourself BEFORE you buy is even better.  You can even let your child view the excerpts and see if he/she appears interested in the DVD, which is what I did.",1139443200,4,261,4.2

2115183,5,B0002Q81VC,"To say my kids LOVE this stupid show would be such an understatement. My daughter found it at the library when she was 18months old and fell in love with it...its been in our family for 5 years now and each of my kids beg for it. It is so corny and quiet annoying but it is BY FAR their favorite movie of all time. My daughter (whom I mentioned above) has been singing her ABC's since she was not quite 2 and my son since he was only about 18m old! My boy is now almost 2.5yrs and knows all his sounds/letters and ever corresponds them to the ""exercises"" Al does in a different show... For that...Al gets a 5!",1421798400,,609,4.041322314049586

2115186,5,B0002Q81VC,"OMG, this was the only video allowed to play for several weeks at our house!  My daughter is delayed in speech.  A friend of mine recommended the Alpha Al series, since it helped her speech delayed son.  My daughter (who is 32 months old now) learned so many of her first words from this dvd it was wonderful!  The only down side is that the graphics are very dated, but that doesn't matter to my daughter :-).",1393200000,,410,4.285714285714286

2115188,3,B0002Q81VC,"This film was poorly done; low budget, faces disappear throughout video, filmed on green screen most likely;  very amateaurish
If I didn't need it to be Circus I would have sent it back",1373328000,,185,4.606060606060606

2115190,5,B0002Q81VC,I work with preschoolers.  I ordered this video after the kids got attached to the Rock N Learn Alphabet Exercise video.  The kids LOVE it!!!  They ask to watch this every day!!!!  This video helps them learn their alphabet and teaches them words that begin with each letter.  It is done so well that the kids don't even realize they are learning from it!  I highly recommend this video!,1367193600,,387,4.536231884057971
2115191,5,B0002Q81VC,"I was very excited when ordering this video for my three year old daughter, and upon receiving the video I must say that it does not dissapoint. My son was hooked on one of Rock n Learn's phonic videos years back, and I really wanted to get something that would interest my daughter. I have tried flash cards with her in order to help her learn her letters and their sounds, but they do not hold her interest. I received this video in the mail the day before yesterday, and I put it on for her in our car. She was hooked! For the past couple of days now when we go to get in the car, she is asking if she is going to be able to watch the video! So pleased with this product. I am considering ordering the Spanish video for my son. :)",1360713600,,733,3.993197278911565

2115193,5,B0002Q81VC,"My son LOVES this DVD. He loves anything to do with letters. Although, Al can be very annoying, my son finds this very entertaining. After watching this, I came to the conclusion that anyone can make a video. No acting or singing skills are required. LOL!!",1354838400,,256,4.586956521739131
2115194,2,B0002Q81VC,"This video is very high in the cheezyness factor and all the rhyming has the word ""you see"" and ""me"" in them. Very annoying. My little boy likes to watch this to make fun of it :-)",1352505600,,180,3.891891891891892
2115195,5,B0002Q81VC,"I love that this DVD kicks into play right away..no ads or nothing, just pure education ready to go!  It's very informational and I'm glad that I checked it out first from the library on a whim.  I am very pleased with this DVD and have already purchased this one and another one by Rock 'N Learn called Shapes, Colors, and Counting!  This DVD keeps the interest of my very busy 18 months old son.  He is also more aware of letters by pointing them out everywhere we go.  My son may not always get them right but I love that he's learning and showing more eagerness since watching DVDs by Rock 'N Learn.  Great product and I especially like the bonus at the end of the Alphabet Circus DVD that shows the alphabet being practiced in both upper and lower case letters and this keeps my son attention also!  He is usually pointing at the TV screen in excitement attempting to pronounce the letters.",1351382400,2,895,4.387878787878788

2115198,5,B0002Q81VC,"Well this is my first review. i don't write reviews because to me everything is either ok or not worth my time. well this Rock N Learn series is way better than ok and well worth my time. i run a business from home and dad of 2 with my oldest just turned 2 years old Nov 17th and so my wife and i bought Colors, Shapes, & Counting, Letter Sounds, Alphabet Exercise, and Alphabet Circus for her to watch while i work. too my suprise she loves them. everytime 1 is done she picks the next 1 to watch. she knows her colors, shapes, can count to 20, knows her abc's, can read 2 small books she has and will try to sound out words she doesnt already know. ok some of you might think thats not a big deal it can be done yes but the big deal is she has only been watching these dvds for 3 days! her grandma just ordered some more Rock N Learn dvds for her for Christmas so i cant wait to see how she reacts to them and how my review with them will be. this series is truely awesome! to an adult it may look cheap made and things like that but if it holds them there with out blinking and they learn that makes it 110% besides if you are an adult and want to complain about how you cant watch it because of how it looks hmmmm something is wrong lol. its a childrens educational movie not Days Of Our Lives so got over it. for the learning experience for the kids and the price you cant beat it. this series is good enough i would of paid $50 a dvd. seriously i would have. if you are thinking about trying it, just do it you won't regret it i promise!",1291248000,,1543,3.9329073482428116

WARNING: They look tacky and sound robotic and mechanical (ahem - annoying to parents ears)
but the kids love it and it is catchy and they learn from them! If given the choice they
always choose Alphabet Circus over other dvd's!
We get ours from the library.... that makes it easier to get a break from it for me!
Really a great educational product!",1278806400,,382,4.394366197183099
2115200,4,B0002Q81VC,"I was told this DVD was a good seller so I purchased it.  When I first watched it, I thought, there is no way that any toddler will like this.  This is now the favorite DVD in my house.  The obvious blue screened background and less than stellar graphics (the lions mane looks like a bad toupee) make it a clear case of you never know..We are Alphabet Al infatuated (even I sing some of the simple yet catchy jingles.)  Anyway, why I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the ""fire eater Freddy"" character who spits fire  (even with the ""don't do this at home kids"" and ""I am a professional"" - it is still very inappropriate - ""F"" could have been a FRIENDLY animal or maybe even a Frog/the Frog would be just as much involved in the circus as a vase by the way, the lion tamer who puts her head in the lions mouth), and hard to recognize words like orangutan and veterinarian.  The good parts that are favorites are the question mark box, when Al falls, the acrobats, the bear on a ball, the hot dog man, and the juggler.  But what is also an added bonus is that the DVD teaches how to write all the letters and numbers.",1278288000,,1120,4.157407407407407

My 3 - 5 preschoolers love Alphabet Al and the circus that features the letters of the alphabet and the descriptions of the circus entertainers as well as the words.
