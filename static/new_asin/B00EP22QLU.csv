8607756,2,B00EP22QLU,"The film opens with the victim's view of her captor. After 10 prostitutes have been killed in Atlantic City, this is number 11, hence the title. The film runs with a subplot of two policemen (Michael Mack, Richard Reid) looking for the murderer who always kills on Friday night. In this film the captive prostitute (Autumn Federici) is discovered by the wife (Julienne Irons) of Richard (Jim Klock), the murderer.

The film consists of the home conflict of the husband who has a tied up prostitute in his garage trying to explain to his wife he is not a monster...after 10 prostitutes have been murdered. And two inept cops chasing the wrong guy. That is pretty much it and at no time is the prostitute in her bra and panties as depicted on the cover.

The film was boring, poorly acted, and badly directed.  It is listed as a crime/mystery/thriller although I didn't know what the mystery or thrill was in the film. The biggest crime is that it was made.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. No nudity. Girl tied up showing cleavage.",1383955200,5,1030,4.612021857923497
8607757,2,B00EP22QLU,"This movie could be performed on a live stage.  The plot sounds like it is highly influenced by a religious background.  I feel like it would be a perfect ""after-school"" special on TV, or at a young adult church youth group.  The image for the movie is completely misleading.  I can't BELIEVE I wasted $4 to watch this movie.  I'm going to try and get a refund.",1383696000,6,361,4.3283582089552235
8607758,5,B00EP22QLU,Really good independent film.  It was really fun to watch and the performances were on target. Great casting and story. It's a must see.,1382832000,2,136,4.666666666666667
