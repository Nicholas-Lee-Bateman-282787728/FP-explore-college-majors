8304043,5,B001G5ZO7W,"This superb film is, in many respects, a Marilyn Horne autobiography. The great Mezzo is interviewed about her entire life, her career, people important to her, and the many roles she assumed. There are a number of flim clips, some relatively rare ones. Commentary by the late Dame Joan Sutherland and Henry Lewis is especially fascinating. Horne very possibly was the greatest mezzo-soprano of the 20th century, and certainly one of the greatest and most talented artist in recent history. This lovingly prepared document in film is a must for those with an interest in great artistry.",1368144000,,586,5.051546391752577
8304044,5,B001G5ZO7W,"Marilyn Horne's reputation as a vocal artist of highest caliber is well-established.  Her humble, down-to-earth beginnings and early career are the interesting and attractive parts of this DVD.  Joan Sutherland and others share their estimations of Marilyn Horne and simultaneously reveal little-known things about themselves.  The only criticism would be that it seems rather short.",1356998400,,383,5.927272727272728
8304045,5,B001G5ZO7W,"Any fan of Marilyn Horne will want to have this in the library.  Don't expect her to pull many punches; she's as real as they come, and pretty frank while still staying within the bounds of good taste.  For those who are strictly interested in the voice: however briefly, the evolution of this magnificent voice is traced, and it is instructive.  Nice surprises: 1) The recordings Marilyn made in her youth in which she imitates pop singers of the day.  What a way to make a couple of bucks!  2) Her comedic adventures with Carol Burnett.  The lady is amazingly versatile.  There is a lot crammed into this 50 minutes.  It will leave you wanting more!  More! More Marilyn!  This 1994 program is well worth updating with additional footage and more menu options.  15 years have passed; this fabulous old broad hasn't been sitting on her arse all that time!  What has she been doing?  What does she think about?  Has she bought any more really great gold jewelry?  (You have to buy the DVD to see what I'm saying here.)  Inquiring minds want to know.  Marilyn fans, such as I, will buy an update.",1251504000,10,1094,4.528205128205128
