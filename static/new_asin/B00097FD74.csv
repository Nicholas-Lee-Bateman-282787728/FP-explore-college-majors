I like that this travelogue hits about 7 different cities within one hour. There are nice scenic views presented, from near and far, and interesting facts about each city. Since I have never been to Italy, I simply used this dvd as a starting point and it has given me an idea of what to see, but renting better travelogues is next.  If you are willing to rent this with its faults, i believe you can gain a bit of knowledge.",1316563200,,597,4.427272727272728
8058064,1,B00097FD74,"The footage on this 2005-released DVD is clearly old, given the styles of the clothing and the pre-Euro currency used in signs.  It all seems to have been shot with a handheld camera.  The quality of the transfer is poor.  The voiceover provides mininal information about the area and some of it seems to be factually incorrect.",1147132800,4,328,4.719298245614035
8058065,1,B00097FD74,"Do not waste your money on this DVD.  It looks as if an amateur shot some film and then put it together with boring music and very limited info using audio voiceover.  No live person giving you good travel info.  It's really awful!!!  Can't believe that Amazon sells this!!!  Plus, it's old, like 1980's.",1143590400,3,304,4.555555555555555
