8119155,5,B000F92YDM,I find that all of her books are helpful.  The detailed pictures are really wonderful for beginners and those of us with a little more experience.  The spiral binding is great too. I don't have to wrestle with the book while I am sewing.,1334793600,,237,4.363636363636363
8119156,5,B000F92YDM,This video is very well put together. It basically shows all you need to know to learn how to quilt. It is well worth the money. It would have cost me over $50.00 dollars just for one day of learning at the community collage here to learn just a little bit. Thanks!!!,1245110400,7,267,4.153846153846154
