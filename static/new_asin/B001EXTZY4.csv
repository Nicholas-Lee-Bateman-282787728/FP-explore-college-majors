3558112,1,B001EXTZY4,"This movie is a horrible waste of time to watch and an embarrassment for fine actors.

Even the title is misleading, definitely no fine art of love here.  The ending was even worse than the movie itself.",1342742400,5,203,4.45945945945946
3558113,1,B001EXTZY4,this story could have been wonderful and highly erotic instead what we get for our money is a story with too few sex scenes hardly any lesbianism and uneccary violence I was so angry at this dvd that I tossed it in the trash where it belongs save your money this is worthless,1317081600,6,275,4.2075471698113205
3558114,2,B001EXTZY4,"Warning: spoilers

This film is trying to be a dark version of a David Hamilton film, but it only succeeds in being capricious and illogical. The two girls who are meant to be the center of the story are treated by the filmmakers as marionettes. Are they supposed to have the obsessive/reluctant lesbian relationship we saw in Lost and Delirious? Are they supposed to be a devoted pair against the evils of the world? Are they supposed to be only having the innocent girl/girl affections of Un t  Saint-Tropez? Apparently, all of these at the same time. Really, they just do whatever the script says for no good reason, and this is an insult to them and their secondary players who are not bad actors. Jacqueline Bisset, who plays the headmistress, is likewise misplaced and clearly is acting above the level of writing she's given.

As said elsewhere, the film is all over the place; tender one minute, gruesomely callous the next, with an ending that is pedantic in its melodrama. The title is about some other film, since this one presupposes to be about girls who are either to be sold to nobles as pretty sex toys or coldly buried in the basement. Yet there's no hint of training in the ""Art of Love"", either in the `70s sense of The Story of 'O' or even a softer version. Sure, there's discipline and dark secrets, but neither come from an institutionalization of sexual slavery to men. The ""prima ballerina"" is simply given over to the prince after having trained heavily for a dance performance. Here, Hidalla suddenly and inexplicably begins openly flirting with the prince, which leads to equally sudden and unfounded tragedy for Irene. And the simple fact that the best girls are meant to be given to nobles doesn't justify all the secrecy and macabre attitudes among the girls and staff of the school; this was a regularly understood practice worldwide throughout history, of which the misogynistic culture remains, if not the institutions. Why would this need to be kept secret from anyone, either the girls or the neighboring townspeople? It would more likely be the accepted way of things as touted by the nobility, with parents (rich or poor) happily handing their girls over for the chance to be married into money and the girls quite possibly fighting tooth and nail to better their peers in the effort. It just doesn't ring true.

Finally, the headmistress is shown alternately allowing and even causing the deaths of her girls (but to hide what, really, the records that show the girls to be commoners?) then standing up for one against a too-affectionate staff member. And this to hide her own past ephebophilia? Very little of this film makes much sense. Even the ""under the waterfall"" sequence, which promised a David Hamilton-esque interlude, ultimately led nowhere as a side-plot that proved nothing that could not have been mentioned in passing.

If you're looking for pretty, nubile, nude girls, try Hamilton (and no, underage nudity is not prohibited in most countries if it's not considered inherently sexual, but I suspect the ""prima ballerina choice"" scene here was done with body doubles). If you're looking for strong young females who are fighting for their lives, look in a dozen other places. This is only good for a few, short moments of earnest concern and affection between two girls that are injected randomly into a film primarily about shame.",1278806400,32,3384,4.8578856152513
3558115,2,B001EXTZY4,"First off, the movie runs about 1 hr 35min not 17 mins as it is listed. It also costs $2.99 and not $1.99 for a 7 day rental. This movie was a trip. It's about a school for girls in the middle of nowhere that teaches ballet. I assume we were to interpret that this is a ""finishing school"". The plot surrounds its self around making the girls wanting to become the ""primaballerina"" for the ballet for the prince. One girl decides that she likes one of the other girls and tries to get the girl to start liking her. Once they are together they become inseperable and start getting into dumb stuff. They try to be secretive so that know one finds them out and try to run away from the school. People are killed and there is nudity in this film (which I hope the girls were of age when they filmed this). The head mistress wants to remain the head honcho and does not like the other woman that is trying to ""steal"" the school from her. The ending makes no sense. The prince and his paupers were all old perverts. I hate ordering movies that don't make sense and this one fits the bill.",1277164800,30,1081,4.201923076923077
3558116,4,B001EXTZY4,"As a Borowczyk fan, I must say I enjoy The Art Of Love, although it may not be his best film. An ambitious ode to poet Ovid, one gets the feeling a larger budget would have been needed to get this done just right. Boro does his best with some nice soft focus and natural lighting, giving the proceedings an airy, glowing look similar to Behind Convent Walls and Emmanuelle 5. Sadly, the print used here gives it a washed out, at times over-exposed look. A film using soft-focus and unusual lighting definitely needed more care in the transfer, and much color correction.

Plotwise, it's basically the story of a handsome Roman general, his cheating wife and her young lover, a student of Ovid. There's a dream-like air of fantasy to the story, and the narrative takes a backseat to the visuals, intentionally I'd say. Performances by the talented and striking cast are hindered by sloppy dubbing, although the lovely score by Luis Bacalov adds much.

So I say, Borowczyk fans check it out... those looking for smut will find Art Of Love too arty and slow, historians probably a bit too pervy.",1274054400,21,1092,4.652849740932642

There is nothing about the fine art of love, so it is miss titled.

8299868,2,B001EXTZY4,"This is my first review because I felt the need to clarify this turmoil in the Reviews section.
First of all, there are two different movies in the Additional DVD option section: 1.- Ars Amandi (The art of love) and 2.- The fine art of love
If you see how poor it was rated, you may not want to buy the fil, but it's mainlybecause they're talking about The Fine Art of Love, and NOT the Walerian Borowczyk version, I've only seen Ars Amandi (the art of love) and it's an splendid erotic movie, I've haven't seen The Fine Art of Love, which everyone seem to hate, but don't be fooled by the customers reviews, don't get confuse, those are two different movies.

I've seen the film before online, and the cinematography it's absolutely gorgeus, it's very colorful with a very soft use of lighting.
 I bought the ''ars amandi - l'arte di amare (dvd) italian import'' version and it's a horrible edition for such beatiful film, the colors are washed out, the quality of the images are very poor and very dark to the point that you don't really see what's going on in the film. So I would highly recommend you toNOT BUY THIS VERSION (which is the Milenium Storm edition) I bought the italian version, because it had the original audio, but this edition its impossible to appreciate.

For those who want to buy The Art of Love by Walerian Borowczyk with great video quality, I would recommend you to go Additional DVD options and search for ''The Art of Love ( Ars Amandi - L'arte di amare ) ( L' Art d'aimer ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 0 Import - Netherlands]'' It may not play on all regions, but it's the best edition you'll find in amazon right now.",1472601600,6,1649,4.417763157894737
8299869,3,B001EXTZY4,well shot but purposely boring . . . deceptively mistitled too. I'd give it 2 and 1/2 stars if I could.,1454371200,,103,3.9523809523809526
