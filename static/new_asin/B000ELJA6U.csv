2521948,5,B000ELJA6U,"Incantato is a marvelousl movie about how love can transform us and make us a better person. It is the story of Nello, a thirty five year old professor of Latin and Greek. A lonely bachelor, his father and mother  push him to leave his native Rome and to go to Bologna with the hope of finding a soul mate. With a series of comic miscalculations and flip flops, Nello finally encounters his dream woman in a clinic for the blind. Angela, a beautiful woman from the upper class is the incarnation of all of Nello's dreams. However, her father and others warn Nello that Angela is not suited for him but he persists. Another touching subplot is how the quiet, unassuming Nello captivates his students in his Latin class with his daring interpretations of love poems and his defiance of the State's boring curriculum. Beautifully photographed, with a lush romantic soundtrack, Incantato is surely a wonderful movie about love, passion and heartbreak.",1202428800,11,947,4.809815950920245
2521949,4,B000ELJA6U,"It,s a good movie, excellent play and interesting the subject. My only problem was that it is so sad, almost like the Postino. But that does not decrease the artistic value",1201219200,5,172,4.580645161290323
2521950,5,B000ELJA6U,"This is essentially, a lesson of life instead a love story. The main feature is a very talented profesor who dominates in notable extent Latin language as well as classics such as Virgilio and lucrecio among others. He is a very shy man who having reached his 35 still have not gotten a couple worthy of his affection, until that day comes, when a blind woman will engage and inspire in him the best of his feelings. There is a notable appearing of Giannini as his father, sailor of several Popes, who makes a terrfic performance spicing the movie of deserved status.

But additionally the impressive beauty of+this new Goddess of the Italian cinema Vanessa Incontrada, is a very important factor to take it into account.

The secondary roles work out at perfection, Avati immerses the spectator and handles the camera as a silent witness to make us to know those intimate and unsaid details behind stages.

This a priceless author piece that must be seen, and I am very glad because after a decade of modest proposals, Italy seems to reencounter with itself as a real market of artistic possibilities and new stories to tell and enjoy.

After you leave the cinema hall, you will remind that smart reflection of Balzac: ""The love: the eternal toy that women pretend to give and men to deserve.""",1184112000,9,1294,4.712389380530974
2521951,5,B000ELJA6U,"There are so many reasons why this is a great film.  The hero of the story is a 35 year old man who is attracted to women but

extremely shy of them.  His father, the tailor to the Catholic Pope, is very sexual so he cannot understand what the problem is with his son.  Nevertheless, he directs him to go to Bologna in the 1920's where the man teaches Greek and Latin to students preparing for university.  At a chance encounter, he discovers a beautiful woman without sight who enchants him.  He falls in love at first glance.

My favorite part of the movie is the love scene. I have NEVER seen one done properly with an extremely shy man experiencing his first sexual encounter.  Too often a film will treat the encounter comically not romantically. The scene is touching, sensitive, and erotic. This European director gets it right.

Finally, the cinematography is gorgeous, particularly the scenes of glittering palaces and restaurants in Italy. In my book the movie is a winner.",1148947200,72,983,4.6686046511627906

8110868,4,B000ELJA6U,"When the inexperienced Nelo falls in love with his ideal woman, he will do anything for her.  He becomes a fool for love and believes that love conquers all.  He is a romantic at heart as we see demonstrated in his teaching of his students as the film opens.  Yet, he also has great standards looking at the outward appearance instead of pursuing someone who is like-minded and it becomes his Achilles Heel when he meets a beautiful blind woman.  He goes to great lengths to assist her in making her former boyfriend jealous and she is obviously using him but he is convinced that only she will make him happy.

When he is spurned later in the movie, he gives up on all his fantasies for his life.  Nothing and no one will compare to the ideal he believes he desires.

I am saddened that those who reject this movie didn't see that his favorite author is his reflection and both his roommate and his father are his anti-thesis.  Yes, he is immature and thus this is the core of the story.  His own shallowness at wanting a beautiful woman causes him great harm and yet, he is so besotted with attaining his ideal woman and relationship, he has destroyed his opportunity in having true happiness, it is he who is blind to reality.  There are plenty of people just like him in the world, who are unrealistic in their expectations and as a result they miss life's greatest joys.

This is a movie worth seeing because of the gorgeous scenery but more importantly it is a well written movie with a moral within it (something sadly missing in many dramas these days).  Beauty is as beauty does.",1417737600,,1588,4.4567474048442905
8110869,4,B000ELJA6U,"Very interesting movie.  Truly enjoyed until the end, which was unexpected and sad.  I do recommend this film if you
enjoy movies about human behavior.",1416355200,2,151,5.0
8110870,5,B000ELJA6U,"I am not a huge fan of love stories but this is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Marvelously acted and directed with impeccable production design and a beautiful score by Riz Ortolani. The film actually understands that ""love"" is a very complicated emotion and explores its possible sources, facets and meanings within the two lead characters. Charming, funny, and ultimately heartbreaking.

I haven't seen anyone mention the obvious here: this film is clearly an hommage to Charles Chaplin's Great ""City Lights"", complete with an ambiguous, bittersweet finale.

I took this out of the local library and immediately purchased my own copy. Trust me on this one.",1408406400,,671,5.090909090909091

8110872,5,B000ELJA6U,"This is a GORGEOUS film ---a beautiful love story but moreso a wonderfulcharacter study.  The performances are marvelous, as is the direction.  Beautiful scenes of Bologna back-in-the-day.  Worth every award it got and more.",1392336000,2,224,5.529411764705882
8110873,2,B000ELJA6U,"Lush scenery and gorgeous decor do not disguise one more insipid Italian male fantasy movie.

An immature, virginal man falls in love/lust with a temporarily blind, shallow, young socialite who well knows how to manipulate and excite men.  The movie fails as comedy because Nello lacks any gravitas and his lust is merely pathetic. The movie fails as tragedy because Nello's experience does not change him. Instead of gaining maturity from his experience, Nello ends up happily sewing garments for the Pope in his father's shop - no more having an independent, creative life in Bologna.

Most damning, it is impossible to identify with the main characters since they are so unrealistic. But perhaps in Berlusconi's Italy, a whorish young beauty and a feckless,immature man who never grows up are standard fare.",1297468800,3,810,5.121212121212121
8110874,4,B000ELJA6U,"Note first of all that the spoken language of this film is Italian, with English subtitles. As usual, the subtitles actually vary a bit from the words being spoken, but do not actually change the overall meaning. This film has some really beautiful, romantic scenes and content, but then there is also a point of betrayal. I think the film is better for Italian speaking audiences than for those reading the subtitles. Well acted, videography is good, sound is a bit lacking at a couple of points, I had to turn the sound up, and back down a time or two, to hear what the actors were saying.",1295740800,3,591,4.481481481481482
8110875,5,B000ELJA6U,"This bitter-sweet love story is like a folk tale from another era - at least a century before the 1920s in which it is set. A 35-year-old tailor's son, played superbly by Neri Marcor, with a modest innocence almost never associated with Italian men, is sent from Rome to Bologna to take a job as a classics teacher and to find a wife. There he meets and falls hopelessly in love, for the first time in his life, with a self-absorbed society girl, who happens to be blind - and in love with another man. Their relationship is both painful and poignant - played out at an almost dreamy pace against the more comic sexual antics of the supporting characters. Veteran actor Giancarlo Giannini, as the father, provides a comic energy of his own. As tailor to the Pope, he represents a vocation that has to my knowledge never been seen in a film before. The photography is lovely and the music rapturous. Be prepared for a lump in your throat in the final scene.",1248220800,,956,4.468571428571429
