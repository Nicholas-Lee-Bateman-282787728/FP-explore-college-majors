8480447,4,B005NGKJEI,"No Woman No Cry is a documentary about Christy Turlington Burns and her journey as she reflects, postpartum and years later, on the care she received during birth compared to the care most women receive in the rest of the world. After experiencing a postpartum hemorrhage in a birth center in NYC and receiving competent care from her midwives, she comes to realize what would have happened without those midwives. Not for the faint at heart, No Woman No Cry is honest and shows the state of maternity care in Tanzania, Bangladesh, Guatemala, and the United States.

 I appreciate this film very much because it does not simply state the realities of maternal mortality but attempts to delve into the political, religious, social and economic reasons why so many die during pregnancy, childbirth, or soon after delivering. What most people do not understand is the fact that 90% of these deaths are preventable with good hygiene, nutrition, a skilled birth attendant like a midwife and access to a cesarean section for the 5% who need it. And still fewer people know why women do not have access to these basic needs, even here in the U.S.

Appropriately left out, our maybe not, was the fact that research is showing that artificial labor induction has risk for amniotic fluid embolism. The mother of three who passed away postpartum from amniotic fluid embolism was induced and I think this is a small hint that maternity care in the US is not always safe or evidence based even though it may be high tech. Ina May's Safe Motherhood Quilt project is a testament to all the women who have died in childbirth, most preventable.

I find No Woman No Cry to be thought provoking as well as heart wrenching. What is the solution for this problem and what are we going to do about it? While many tout family planning and access to abortion as top priorities, I think the solution goes much much deeper than health care. This issue is spiritual and one that needs to be addressed by Christians. I am hopeful to think that knowing about this issue will help people to minister to women and their families at a key point in their lives-- a very effective tool for Christ and being His hands and feet for those who need them desperately. Places like Mercy in Action are doing this very thing.

The one thing I did not like about this film was the fact that traditional birth attendants (TBAs) were not talked about very highly. It is unfortunate that they are misunderstood because it has been proven that they are one of the keys to solving maternal death. Mother Health International has demonstrated that giving additional training and resources to traditional birth attendants in order to continue what they are already doing, but even more effectively, saves lives. While it may seem obvious, most people set up clinics that women have a hard time getting to and when they do, do not have the money to pay for. When TBAs are in the same community as mothers, they provide care that is culturally and religiously savvy while still life saving.  Even more, when TBAs know when to refer to the hospital and the hospital has a good relationship with them, all parties win. This is the midwifery model at its best and can work anywhere, in any language. When you look back at the entire picture, you can see that all cultures instinctively develop the midwifery model of care without thinking. It is natural and humane.",1360972800,10,3410,4.693979933110368

8480449,5,B005NGKJEI,"I bought this documentary to show to an honours class that was interested in medical careers.  I think that it goes well with the book ""Get Me Out"".  The documentary was well made.  I plan to show it outside in my garden during one of our summer ""movies in the garden"" nights that we host at our house.",1340496000,2,302,4.172413793103448
