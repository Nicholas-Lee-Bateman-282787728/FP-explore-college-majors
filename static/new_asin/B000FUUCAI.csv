2591566,5,B000FUUCAI,"It's truly an artistic movie! 5 stars to Amitabh Baachan, his wife Jaya, & his once upon a time lover in real life Rekha. I don't know how any wife could give an outstanding performance on the set of making a movie, with the one woman who tried to break up their marriage in real life. If you know the history of these three actors, you'd give them high props too. For those, that don't. Just enjoy this movie. It's a great Amitabh, Jaya classic!!",1364601600,,447,4.270588235294118
2591567,3,B000FUUCAI,"The credit goes some of the writing skills, Rekha's beauty, three of the songs, and the photography. But there are  serious holes in the plot. The story is about a man marrying his recently killed Air Force brother's pregnant fiancee and trying to do his duty as husband. His married old flame walks into his life and they have an affair. The story makes the point that it is not possible to live a socially accepted life if one has a double-life. Eventually the man ends the affair and comes home to his pregnant wife and she accepts him. The wife is pregnant? How did that happen if he was so devoted to his old lover and had a loving relationship with her? Of course, many answers can be guessed, but this is a big hole in the plot that defeats the spirit of the story. The whole plot loses credibility with this 'pregnancy' twist.

The 'holi' dance of the lovers and some of the double-meaning dialogues are plain stupid because they are not subtle. The scene in which the wife confronts her husband's lover is written and acted very well. Amithabh Bhachan looks pretty bad and his dancing is no match for Rekha's Bharatanatyam-based highly scientific skills.

The 'pregnancy weapon' came handy for Jaya Bhachan's character not only for getting married, but for saving the marriage, too!",1262044800,4,1291,4.6535087719298245
2591568,4,B000FUUCAI,"Silsila was made in 1981 and it has the all star cast - Jaya Bachan, Amitabh Bachan, Rekha and Shammi Kapoor.  I rented this movie because the songs were really nice. I had just seen Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham a couple of days ago and Jaya Bachan is unrecognizable in this movie.

Amitabh Bachan and Shammi Kapoor are brothers in this movie. There are different love angles in this movie. Basically the movie deals with the issue of adultery which is not talked about openly in India even though it does occur.  The movie is 3 hours long but it holds the viewer's attention with the different twists the movie makes. Personally, I didn't agree with some decisions made in the movie, but this movie was still enjoyable overall.",1167004800,6,722,4.5813953488372094
8127128,3,B000FUUCAI,I agree with one of the other reviews here. She was pregnant? But how? The movies loses credibility at that point.,1524700800,,114,4.476190476190476

8127137,4,B000FUUCAI,"Silsila is a classic bollywood movie that involved the concept of infidelity in indian marriages. It was rumored that Amitabachan and Rekha actually had an affair in real life  and this movie sort of alluded to that notion. The bollywood songs are quite awesome. This movie copy was uncut, clear, and was of excellent quality. If you plan on purchasing this particular movie, this is a copy i recommend.",1403568000,,403,4.840579710144928
