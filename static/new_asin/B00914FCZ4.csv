5231659,5,B00914FCZ4,"This is a very moving and inspiring film - a rare and intimate invitation into the lives
of musicians struggling with both the creative process, and the challenges of the
business. There was so much here for me to identify with. It is a must see for artists of
any stripe.",1306195200,,272,4.352941176470588
5231660,5,B00914FCZ4,"I was lucky enough to see THIS TIME a few weeks ago, and because the characters and themes were so vivid, it's still with me.  The unfolding of detail in each character was paced thus that I really felt that I was right in there with these totally full-of-life characters, right with them on their journey.  As a documentary it goes so far beyond simply presenting information: it's full of both humor and drama.

It touches on so many themes that anybody who's wanted more than what they have right now can understand--what it takes to reach a dream, how to get out of your own way, keep hope alive, work with others, and deal with regret.  And finally, THIS TIME is about how to live a life and find joy as you reach for that dream.  It has a wonderfully combination of the inspirational, cautionary, and delightful--all at the same time.",1306195200,,840,4.5
5231661,5,B00914FCZ4,"""This Time"" is that rare documentary that really make you care about its subjects, (three singing acts as well as the manager of one of the singers) and you are immersed in their individual worlds as they navigate their careers, make ends meet, all the while searching ever hopefully for the elusive goal of musical success - it's a beautifully edited film, and the music itself is terrific as well.  The standout for me personally  is the wildly talented singer-songwriter Bobby Belfry; a sparkling and much-beloved fixture on the New York cabaret scene, but the stories of the women are equally gripping and quite moving.  Get your hands on this movie today - you won't regret it!",1305417600,5,682,4.811965811965812
5231662,5,B00914FCZ4,This was one of my favorite movies of the year.  I went with a group of people and we all wanted to see it again.  I can't get enough of Pat Hodges and the Sweet Inspirations.  Their performances are awesome.  Why are there not more movies like this?,1364083200,,250,4.145833333333333

5231664,5,B00914FCZ4,"Got to see ""This Time"" on Opening Night in NYC.  What a great film.  It captures the hardships of the music industry- one day, you're a hit and one day you are struggling.  And in some cases, it can be the same day.
This behind the scenes ""intimate"" telling of these great artists, is funny at times... and heartbreaking at others.  All of these performers have a story to tell... and this film tells it in a very honest, sincere and moving way.  Bravo to the filmmaker, Victor Mignatti and the great cast of performers: Pat Hodges, Bobby Belfry, Peitor Angell, The Sweet Inspirations and Cissy Houston.

5231666,5,B00914FCZ4,"this is a great documentary film. i have loved the sweets since the 60's when i first heard their record ""sweet inspiration"", and have been a fan ever since. this is a great behind look at a group that should have been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame years ago. i also really enjoyed the look at two other great talents, pat hodges and bobby belfry. these are all such nice and talented people that fame has eluded.",1361059200,2,428,4.296296296296297
5231667,4,B00914FCZ4,"I was over the moon at finally getting a copy of this film after a year of trying for it!  Anything with The Sweet Inspirations in it is good for me and Pat Hodges was a bonus.  It was good to finally get some details on girls I have long adored but I found the layout of the film hard to follow at times.

The stories were not exactly intertwined more hopping back and fore between artists. The young bar singer whose name has already escaped me was interesting but his story did not really fit in with the others who have been big names in the past and who seem to have become forgotten by all but the die-hard fans and consequently I kept wondering why his story was included and it made the whole thing for me seem disjointed.

It was also good to see Cissy Houston as well. The one thing that did come home to me was that I never knew Pat Hodges had a new album and was able to buy it as a result of seeing the film and a few searches.  The Sweets album I had already found when it was released, but I was disappointed to see that they were the recipients of the usual record company changes with their single (which I had also found before the film)which shifted the focus away from them.

However, as a die-hard Sweets and Hodges, James & Smith fan it was money well spent and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",1351209600,2,1320,4.1568627450980395
5231668,5,B00914FCZ4,"This Time helps convey something essentially American about struggling in the pursuit of our deepest held dreams. I'm a professional performer so perhaps I'm biased, but I think the film's explorations of success and vocation, faith and heart, will resonate with a wide audience.

The struggle is especially intense for performers - and this movie captures a slice of the capriciousness and brutality of the music industry -- but it is not exclusive to us. The film shows us how one can be 'on top' by some measures, like having a hit record, and still be nowhere by other measures, like financial security.

There is no success in show biz that inures one to financial stress, or career dips, or self-doubt. Frankly there is no success in any industry that does that, though we pretend there is. In the music business there is no pretending.

In the film we see its subjects repeatedly confronting their own definitions of success, re-considering their choices, re-committing to their careers, accepting or rejecting standard markers of who and how they should be. For all of them, faith -- in an outside source, in themselves, in each other, in the value of their art - is the anchor amid that constant re-examination.

In many ways in this country we're still ingesting bootstrap myths about how life is in America, and we cling to them despite all evidence to the contrary. `If you're good at what you do, you will naturally ascend'; 'once you hit your stride, you're set for life'; 'you have total control of your success or failure'. This film challenges those notions, along with the subconscious operating mantra that setbacks won't happen to us if we plan carefully and behave well.

We see in the film that the best laid plans can be upended, and that many of our assumptions about the correlation between work and success are false.

Doing what you love, without structure and progress, is not gratifying in and of itself. Doing excellent work is gratifying, but doesn't necessarily lead to money or fame. Fame by itself didn't equal success for anyone in the movie. Working hard doesn't guarantee financial reward or career advancement. Being business savvy and having contracts in place doesn't mean other people will play fair.

You'd think it'd be sobering, but instead I left the screening refreshed and uplifted. By the end of the film, it seems like the focus shifts from the external rewards everyone is still actively seeking to the internal rewards they have already created for themselves; staying connected to the essential truth of their dreams, keeping an open heart amid the daily toil, building the sort of character which allows them to survive and thrive no matter what the weather brings.

I was moved by the music, hopeful about the subject's futures, and rooting for the continued buoyancy of their spirits. Thank you for a terrific film.",1334102400,,2870,4.903092783505155
5231669,5,B00914FCZ4,I had no idea this dvd was out until I saw it on amazon. I purchased it and found it most interesting. I would recommend it to music lovers.,1311897600,2,140,3.8620689655172415
5231670,5,B00914FCZ4,"Anyone who's served their time in the ranks of the ""struggling artist"" community will appreciate this film. A fitting tribute not only to the individual stars bringing life to ""This Time,"" but the tens of thousands of aspirants just like them, who wake up every morning with that same fire to create.",1311292800,,300,4.788461538461538
5231671,5,B00914FCZ4,"Anyone who's ever made anything will see themselves in this movie. Along with a killer soundtrack, This Time shows all the heart and heartache that goes into making music. The documentary's a little on the long side but it's worth it to follow the journeys of several musicians as they try to make it (or make it again). Reminds me of one of my favorite documentaries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comedian/dp/B00005JLW5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comedian</a>, except of course that This Time follows musicians rather than comedians.

5231678,5,B00914FCZ4,"I was very impressed by this film.  The material, the story, and the emotional involvement with the characters are all very captivating.  All of the characters are such strong, inspiring people. The film does a great job of demonstrating what talented artists all of the charaters are and getting you invested in them emotionally so that you really feel for them (and with them) as the challenges and obstacles and losses pile up.  Then, by the end, each of them rises up and shines with determination and inspiration that you feel in your guts.  I was (pleasantly) surprised to see how much it is a film about faith, in dreams as much as in God.

It is an impressive and moving film!",1307664000,2,684,4.573770491803279
5231679,5,B00914FCZ4,I loved this movie and recommended it to everyone I know. It made me want to dance and sing.  It is so uplifting and inspirational that I want to see it again.,1307404800,,159,3.96875
5231680,5,B00914FCZ4,"""As over-the-top as it sounds, This Time changed my life.  To see the
struggles and heartaches and highs of being an artists - hearing Pietor
Angell say ""you have to be a warrior for your own dreams""- encouraged me to
take my painting seriously, and to be come an advocate for myself as an
artist.  Long story short, I'm represented by a gallery now for the first
time.  The portraits of the Sweet Inspirations and other singers - other
artists -  captures the sometimes painful process of creativity and the
reality of today's marketplace.  This Time is a terrifically moving film, and
not to be missed.""",1306281600,,605,4.669811320754717
5231681,5,B00914FCZ4,"Congratulates on a splendid review of artists' passion and the hard time it takes to feed the fire. Most of all, I wish all the best to Pietor Angell, Bobby Belfry, the Sweet Inspirations, and Pat Hodges. The forum you afforded these professional artists moved and inspired me and left me with a deep and lasting impression of their enormous will. Sometimes it is hard to remember that one does not have to stop a tragedy to be a hero.",1306281600,,435,4.45

5231683,5,B00914FCZ4,"The intertwined stories of the cast provided great insight to the  hard work and dedication needed to make it in Music and Show business. Even with the
  star power of Elvis behind you, a little luck goes a long way!  This movie is very captivating and entertaining. After seeing ""This Time"" I can't wait for the
  soundtrack. A real treat for the ears. I have a whole new appreciation for those who struggle both financially and emotionally to entertain us. Honest

5231685,5,B00914FCZ4,"This  movie is very powerful! I enjoyed the film just as much the second time as I did the first time.  After the film ended, I turned to my friend and asked him what he thought, he couldn't respond, and tears just welled up in his eyes. I especially loved Bobby, he seems like such a great person with so much to give.  I would buy his cd on the spot after seeing this film. If you are an artist, or if you have a dream, this film is for you.",1306195200,,443,3.8461538461538463
5231686,5,B00914FCZ4,"It's hard for most of us to think that stardom isn't the goal of every performer. However, in the very loving hands of writer/director Victor Mignatti, ""This Time"" introduces us to a disparate group of performing artists whose careers comfortably nestle around the fringes of celebrity. Edited to perfection, we watch the ""every(wo)man"" struggle unfold of being true to oneself while balancing all the expectations and doubts we harbor within. What results is a story that is as much heartwarming and uplifting as it is tribute to the indomitability of the human spirit.",1306195200,,570,5.139784946236559

8533670,5,B00914FCZ4,"I enjoyed the sincere reality of it all.  I was also intrigued by the fascinating life the Sweet Inspirations experienced.  Myrna Utley-Smith was my neighbor, friend, and grammar school mate during our childhood in the James M. Baxter Terrace housing projects in Newark, N. J.  May she rest in peace (Myrna died Christmas Eve 2010).",1382227200,,332,5.0
8533671,5,B00914FCZ4,A fabulous documentary that shows a side of the music industry rarely seen.  My attention was drawn to Pat Hodges and wondered if she is the same Pat Hodges that sang In A Dream on the Dr. Who television movie?

8533672,4,B00914FCZ4,"A deeply moving story about dreams deferred, shattered, resurrected and given new life.  The highlight of the film is when Cissy Houston (mother of the late Whitney Houston) reunites with the Sweet Inspirations in the recording studio and harmonizes their classic tunes.  The Sweet Inspirations went through an incredible journey on their path to fame.  A good film to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1368057600,,405,5.2

I feel inspired to continue.  The film makes you feel anything is possible and that you should never give up as along as youhave love and energy for what you want to achieve.

8533674,5,B00914FCZ4,An amazing film by Victor Mignatti.  I went to this because I loved his BROADWAY DAMAGE.  This is another triumphant film.  A deep and inspirational look into the lives of performers and the sacrifices and sadness as well as pure joy.  And that Pat Hodges makes me believe in God.  I love how much Peitor Angell LOVES his ladies.  Watching this makes me wanna see these people live.  Including sensational Bobby Belfry.  Maybe one can catch him in NYC.,1367712000,,452,4.632911392405063
8533675,5,B00914FCZ4,"What a nostalgic walk down memory lane. The Sweet Inspirations, Pat Hodges et al. Such an inspiration to those of us who have been there, done that and gonna do it again.
I loved the music, the stories, the touching scenes. Pat Hodges, homeless in South L.A., given a chance to come back to the stage and do what she does best. Unbelievable! The voices, the effort, the ""never give up"" attitude. A lesson for all actors, singers and those of us who tread ""the boards"". Such a joy to see it all in one place. This film is special and should not be missed. The soul and heart of the performers, right out there where we can see and feel it. Thank you to all involved in this documentary. 4 stars!!!!!!",1367452800,,699,4.303030303030303
8533676,4,B00914FCZ4,"Realistic insight into the human experience as it relates to singing and performance. THe true star of this piece is Peitor Angell, a person with a gentle presence who believes in the enduring talents of The Sweet Inspirations and Pat Hodges of Hodges, James & Smith, a flamboyant trio from the 70s. He is there for them. This is a great no frills documentary which demonstrates, especially in the case of Myrna from The Sweet Inspirations that the dream never dies.",1365984000,,466,4.765432098765432
8533677,5,B00914FCZ4,This was one of my favorite movies of the year. I went with a group of people and we all wanted to see it again. I can't get enough of Pat Hodges and the Sweet Inspirations.
