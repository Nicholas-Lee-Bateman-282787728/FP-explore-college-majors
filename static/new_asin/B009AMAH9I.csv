5299517,3,B009AMAH9I,"I had to think about ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH for a day or two, before deciding how much I liked it. Ultimately, it's a fun/sometimes funny animated film that doesn't really stand out from many other films like it ... but somehow remains likable and cute; a brightly-colored feast for the eyes, too.

We start on the far-distant planet of Baab (where everyone is the color of a blue slushee), in time to see space adventurer and honored hero Scorch Supernova (voiced by Brendan Fraser) perform yet another daring rescue ... in large part due to the help of his nerdy older brother, Gary (Rob Corddry), who is back at Mission Control. But when Scorch is sent to the Dark Planet (aka, Earth) - a planet from which no alien has every returned - to answer a distress call, AND is captured by a hostile military there, when his boss seems slow to respond it's the nerdy Gary who's forced to go on his first rescue mission, in order to save his own brother. Insanity ensues in this good-for-kids animated feature that has enough action and story for adults to get invested a bit, too.  Again, nothing you haven't seen before - but still not without its charm.",1370044800,,1153,4.538461538461538
5299518,5,B009AMAH9I,"I took my boys to see this movie at the theater and we loved it, so much so that we couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  My 4 year old laughed hysterically at different parts, and honestly he probably didn't understand half of it.  The characters were memorable ones that each had their own unique personalities. The movie is about two brothers, one a hero and the other the computer nerd.  The computer nerd handles Mission Control and has a son who idolizes his brother the hero.  After Scorch goes on a mission to the dangerous planet (Earth) he gets captured.  Gary (computer nerd) goes on a rescue mission to save his brother and show his family that he is a hero too!  On Earth the brothers are forced to do the bidding of building a weapon to destroy other planets.  There are other aliens in the movie and they are hysterical!  I honestly haven't seen a good kids movie in a long time and this one was worth it.  It was about 1 hour 30 minutes and we will definitely watch again when it comes to DVD.  I don't feel either that there was anything inappropriate for young kids, but yet it is still a movie that will appeal to all ages.",1369526400,7,1146,4.263888888888889
5299519,4,B009AMAH9I,"Unlike a few years ago when a new animated theatrical feature was a special event, these days we seem to get offered a computer animated film every month or so.  Few of these efforts can to compare to classics like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THE LION KING, SHREK or TOY STORY, but every now and then we do get one that is well conceived and entertaining.

ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH is definitely well conceived and entertaining.

Scorch Supernova (voiced by Brendan Fraser) is the most celebrated space traveler from the planet Baab.  When a distress signal is received from the Dark Planet (also known as ""Earth""), Scorch jumps at the chance to attempt a rescue, even though his brainy brother, Gary (Rob Corddy) warns him that know intergalactic explorer has every returned from that mysterious planet.

The distress signal is, indeed, a trap, set by the evil General Shanker (William Shatner) and Scorch falls into it.  Now, only Gary can save him.

ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH  features state-of-the-art animation and many laughs, as well as a voice cast that includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Jonathan Morgan Heit, Sofia Vergara and Jessica Alba.  Carl Brunker directed.

The 4-disc comb-pack (3D Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, Ultraviolet) from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes many extras: audio commentary by director Brunker, a ""Making of"" featurettes, deleted scenes and music featurettes.

5299520,3,B009AMAH9I,"watched this at the drive-in with my 3 year old son and he loved it, was laughing and at the end of his seat but an an adult it was .... cute.  I'm not going to drag this at as most of the other reviewers have stated the same thing more eloquently but it' just an animated movie that kids will love and it won't be painful to sit through but it's not going to be on the frequently played list.",1367452800,6,393,3.8518518518518516
5299521,4,B009AMAH9I,"Director Carl Bunker (Storyboard Artist on Ice Age Continental Drift and Horton Hears A Who!) in his first feature length animated film as a director, does a really fine job of using quick wit and sarcasm with some obvious jabs at pop culture and took a Tony Leech and Cory Edwards (both writers on Hoodwinked, Hoodwinked Too!) story and a screenplay written by himself and Bob Barlen (short - Push and Turn) and made a really fun family friendly film.

As you would guess it's the story of two alien brothers, one a brainier computer nerd mission control operator and the other a masculine, good looking and adorned by all `stud' and star pilot of space exploration for his planet. Well it's the over ambition of the younger more popular brother who causes his older and wiser brother (and his alien family) to get in big trouble. Where else? On Earth!

Brandon Fraser (The Mummy, Bedazzled) plays the younger and wild brother Scorch Supernova with such flare and arrogance that if you ever had an overly egoistical relative, you'll relate to how obnoxious they can be. Rob Corddry (W., Blades of Glory) plays the older, wiser and less popular brother Gary Supernova who obviously has been putting up with his brothers pushy obnoxiousness all his life.

Jonathan Morgan Heit (Date Night, Bedtime Stories) plays Gary's son Kip Supernova and as usual his hearts in the right place but tends to try and help a really bad situation and ends causing a little more trouble than everyone planned on. His kind, smart and definitely strong mother Kira Supernova is played by Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex In The City, Ed Wood). She gets in a few `cat fights' with Lena Thackleman another alien who is the evil henchwoman to the real villain voiced by Jessica Alba (Fantastic Four, Valentine's Day).

Now you got to have a bad guy. He has to be in the military. He has to hate aliens and he has to have a world domination goal. Who plays General Shanker of the US Military? Why William Shatner (Star Trek, Boston Legal) himself! I must say he is probably having a great time voicing this role too!

Throw in Sofia Vergara (Modern Family) as the alien newswoman Gabby Babblebrock (and love interest for Scorch) and you have a fun space adventure on Earth! Ricky Gervais (The Office, The Invention of Lying) plays a computer wide system that he tends to give some very funny commentary to all things electronic. More than a little sarcasm is dished out, but definitely for some comic relief.

There is also a band of good aliens that team up with our heroes like the voices of George Lopez (Valentine's Day, Rio) as slimy alien Thurman and Jane Lynch (Glee, Wreck It Ralph) as the humongous alien Lo. The four of them do some serious bonding and help each other in ways they never expected!

I thought this movie was energetic and had some characters that I think everyone can relate to and has a nice strong message of doing the right thing and the strength that is in family and friends. Good fun for the whole family.",1363046400,,3005,4.637218045112782
5299522,4,B009AMAH9I,"Scorch (Brendan Fraser) is a muscle headed alien action hero astronaut. His brother Gary (Rob Corddry) is the brains of the two and monitors Scorch in mission control with the help of his computer Mr. James Bing, a take off on the name James Bond and not James Blish as I had hoped. Scorch's latest mission is to go to ""The Dark Planet"" (Earth). It gets its name because aliens go there and never return.

It is a trap and Scorch gets captured in Area 51 with the other missing aliens. Nerdy Gary sets out to rescue Scorch and the other aliens from a diabolical human.

The film missed its mark at creating a satire of other films. In one scene you hear someone yelling ""James! Cameron!"" Something you might expect in a film with blue aliens. The Narlacks are akin to Morlocks.

It is a movie the kids should enjoy and one you will get bored with about the time of the alien food fight. On a kids scale, ""Wreak-It-Ralph"" is far better. This rates down there with ""Frankenweenie"".

This film is an 89 minute promo for the 7-11 Big Gulp. 3 1/2 stars",1362787200,,1047,4.3538461538461535
5299523,3,B009AMAH9I,"The beginning of the year is a slow time for the PG regular movie-going crowd. Family-friendly movies are more sparse, and GOOD family movies are a downright rarity. Which has never made much sense to me, since in the cold winter, going to the movies is one of the few (somewhat) affordable things to do with kids. So, we were excited when Escape From Planet Earth came out and we had high hopes that it was going to be a good watch.

It was a nice story about two very different but close brothers who have to learn how to be themselves while also letting the other one shine. Anyone who has more than one kid would probably agree that they watch their own children struggle with this quite often, so I liked the message behind the movie.

The other positives:
the animation is great (but nothing we haven't seen), it's colorful, appropriate for young kids, and has a few laughable scenes sparringly scattered throughout.

The not-so positives:
It's extremely predictable. Yes, it's a kids movie. But does that mean it has to be a generic kids movie? My kids appreciate something original just as much as I do. Unfortunately, being formulaic means despite its best efforts, it gets pretty boring most of the time. I had to take away my 10 year old's itouch because she kept going on it and my 7 year old son was more entertained by playing with his 3D glasses and the seat. They don't demonstrate poor behavior during movie showings, we go all the time. So when they get this distracted, I know that they're getting just as bored as I am.

The movie TRIES to engage parents, even reaching as far as staging a good old fashioned Mommy-War in there... You know, the Stay-At-Home-Mom gets belittled by the Working Mom yet ends up being 10x's smarter and more resourceful, demonstrating that Stay-At-Home moms are worthy of respect.... Oh, yawn. The only people who don't respect Stay-At-Home-Moms or Working Moms are morons, so do we really have to be pandered to like this during a kids movie? Of course, my kids never would have picked up on this, it was just an annoying observation. Had the movie been able to keep us successfully entertained, I would have completely overlooked it.

But, apon walking out after he movie was over and asking for reviews, all I got from the kids and their friends was a resounding shoulder shrug and a ""it was okay... Can we go to the arcade now?""

And that's what Escape From Planet Earth is: Boring for parents, just okay for kids.",1362182400,41,2467,4.582766439909297
5299524,4,B009AMAH9I,"This movie was fun to go watch, albeit a little slow starting out. Being a geek myself, I enjoyed watching a movie where the geeky engineer is the protagonist, gets (already has) the girl, and saves the day. Escape from Planet Earth is a pretty predictable movie, but what would you expect from a children's movie. I enjoyed the fact that almost every alien stereotype and conspiracy theory is addressed as the source of comedy in the movie (i.e. - the road signs stating that Gary Supernova was entering and leaving area 48, 49, and 50 before ""entering"" area 51). Although a movie made for children, Escape from Planet Earth is a good movie for the young at heart as well. It seems like not many family movies now days actually contain an entire family, but this movie does. It also focuses on the tight-knit cohesiveness of the family unit and brings to the surface the fact that we would do almost anything for family.

The reason I rate it 4 stars is that, as I stated before, it is slow-moving. I would have expected a little quicker plot, as the title and movie artwork would suggest. However, I feel that the moral of the story, combined with the humor, overcome the pace. It really is an enjoyable movie, though it might be better to go to a matinee or wait for it to be released to video.",1361836800,18,1297,4.449579831932773
5299525,3,B009AMAH9I,"The plot from ""Escape from Planet Earth"" is pretty much what you would expect from any movie about aliens landing on planet Earth dating back to ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"": Guys in yellow NBC suits (no, not Peacock executives) show up to capture the alien and hilarity ensues. What's so surprising about ""Escape"" is how it casually embraces Internet conspiracy theory and makes it fodder for a kid's movie.

The story begins on Planet Baab (pronounced ""Bob"") where blue-skinned national hero Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is like the Buzz Lightyear of BASA (Baab version of NASA, I guess), backed by the Woody equivalent of his planet, head of mission control Gary (Rob Corddry).  Gary's married to a hot wife (yes, this film makes this point twice, although part of the joke is that the blue aliens all look the same to us) named Kira (Sarah Jessica Parker) who was formerly BASA chief before she decided to be a stay-at-home mom to their son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit).  Yes, this comes up too.

Scorch's new mission is to visit the Dark Planet, which no alien species has ever returned from.  He is ordered there by the new BASA chief, Lena (Jessica Alba), but it's so dangerous that Gary quits in protest, leaving Scorch on his own. Of course, when Scorch arrives he ends up captured by William T. Shanker (William T. Shatner, hilariously riffing on his Captain Kirk persona), military head of Area 51.  Gary, guilty over quitting and leaving his brother stranded, decides to finally be a hero and try to rescue him.

SPOILER FROM PLANET EARTH: He fails miserably.

And that's when ""Escape"" really gets rolling, eagerly embracing all your favorite conspiracy theories: the grays are working for the government, they are creating alien technology, and the government sells back that alien technology to private front corporations which is why we have the touch screens, the Internet, and social networking.  These technologies have been invented by captured aliens diminutive mouse Doc (Craig Robinson), three-eyed slug Thurman (George Lopez), and crab-like giant Io (Jane Lynch).

Although the trailers make it look like ""Escape"" is, well, a buddy-escape movie, it takes quite a long time before any escaping happens.  Mostly, Gary argues with Scorch, Lena and Kira fight, and Shanker makes some glorious Kirk-like speeches.

The pacing wildly uneven, ranging from rake-to-the-crotch jokes to awkward interspecies romance.  At one point, a very scary monster is given a voiceover that sounds like someone in the movie theater shouting with a funny voice  presumably to make the monster less scary in post-production.  There's also the occasional BOING! sound effect that's rather dissonant with the rest of the film's high stakes (Death Star-level planet destroying).

The moral of the story seems to be that geeks can fight the power, get the girl, and save the world  except that Gary pretty much has the first two to begin with.  Still, that's not a bad tale for kids to take away from a film that occasionally veers into adult territory. My son really liked it.",1361232000,6,3074,5.017716535433071

5299573,3,B009AMAH9I,"A pretty decent family film that reworks the Planet 51 formula and turns it on its head.  The reason I'm not giving this four stars is that it is a bit formulaic and predictable at times.  That, and the dialogue is also pretty cliche.

One of the minor issues with these kinds of films is that the story and dialogue are kept basic so that everyone can understand.  There's also an element of keeping the visuals and humor fast.  The idea being that delivering humor fast is part of the timing for successful humor.  So you get a lot of references and quick flashbacks combined with action sequences that, although it's clever, doesn't really deliver on the wit.

Still, for all that, it's respectable basic entertainment for all of the predictability.  Not a bad film, pretty decent at times, but not something I'd rent again.  Check out a copy at the library if you can.",1505692800,,872,4.574193548387097

I recomend to skip this movie and go watch some other movies for example gravity, i heard a crap load of aweome things  about it. how about the wolverine (2013 film) and i heard  a huge ple of awesome things abut that movie to.

A heroic alien being is lured to Earth (aka The Dark Planet) by a false SOS and captured. He's smart, but no-so-heroic alien brother sets out to rescue him.

What did I think?

Youll want to Escape From The Theater. While the premise of humans being the feared bad guys promises some interest, the fact aliens all seem to act the same way just leaves this film as space junk. William Shatner playing the bad guy is the sole saving grace of a movie that will only appeal to the very young.",1423958400,,505,4.294736842105263

We watched it that evening & were both pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it!  There was lots of good humor, including some neat 'tongue-in-cheek' stuff---much of which would escape meaning for younger kids.  We really enjoyed & appreciated the good moral lessons & close-knit family values included in the plots.  Some complained of it being rather slow, which we did not really notice.  We also enjoyed one of the bonus features which had  interviews with the main characters' actors---the guy portraying 'Scorch' was a hoot!!!

 The storyline is good and so are the affects. It's fun to watch with family or yourself. It's like the old Disney movies for the family and the very young children, The affects are more up dated of today's ways of movie making. I enjoyed it and maybe you might too when you see it.

There are quite a few amusing lines and funny interactions.  The characters are unique and lovable.  Ricky Gervais as the computer really cracked me up.  Craig Robinson's alien is also very funny.  Of course, Shatner is an excellent villain.

The visuals are enthralling.  Really cool technology, ships, aliens, monsters, etc.  It keeps you watching.

The story is different, if a little predictable.  But it's a kids' movie.  Really well-done too.  If your kids enjoyed Monsters Inc., Ice Age, or Madagascar, this movie will do the trick.  It deserves a sequel.

5300768,3,B009AMAH9I,"Escape from Planet Earth opened around the globe to heartfelt shrugs and lots of not going to the theater. The bits of it that I saw in between the bits where I kept zoning out seemed okay. I got nothing bad to say about the animation, which is very good and colorful but not quite as eye-popping as the CG stuff in, say, The Croods or How to Train Your Dragon. No, man, the gripes concern other areas.

The premise gives us a 180 twist on the alien abduction urban legend. On the planet Baab, hero astronaut Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) rakes in all the pub and the fan love, just check out his endorsements and how the masses and the media hang on his every word. Never mind that Scorch is brash and impulsive and dim-witted and that, more often than not, his bacon gets saved by his meek, nerdy brother, Gary (Rob Corddry), who runs Mission Control for each of Scorch's field ops.

Sucks then for Scorch that a sibling spat splits him and Gary up, just in time for Scorch to deploy to the Dark Planet, somewhere in the uncharted sector of the galaxy, in response to an S.O.S. call. Alarmingly, 106 advanced lifeforms had previously landed on the Dark Planet, only to be never heard from again. But off goes Scorch, blithely. I did say dude was dim-witted. And when Scorch gets captured, can Gary Supernova, fretful as a granny crossing the street, break him out of Area 51, a secret facility where confined aliens are forced to produce the latest in Earth's hi-tech advances?

If you don't know by now that the Dark Planet is actually our own planet Earth, then you must not have peeked at the movie title. The one scene that really drew chuckles out of me takes place moments after Scorch lands in the desert and he attempts to communicate with a flappy, perpetual-motioned, inflatable figure planted in front of a 7-Eleven. I spent pretty much the rest of the film trying to turn my frown upside down.

Goes to show that you could have an all-star voice cast (William Shatner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jane Lynch, Jessica Alba, Ricky Gervais, etc.), and it means didd1y squat unless you've a tight script for them to read. Reportedly, seven different writers took a shot writing this thing, and then there's that lawsuit filed by story co-writer Tony Leech and producer Brian Inerfeld that accuses the Weinsteins of forcing 17 rewrites. Stuff like that tend to mess up a screenplay. What we're left with are weak, muddled story elements. The actors do their best but succumb to the albatross of uninteresting roles made drearier with flat character arcs - with the sole exception of Gary's indomitable stay-at-home action heroine wife, Kira (Sarah Jessica Parker). Frankly, I was clamoring for more scenes with Kira.

In fact, the best bits are Ricky Gervais' wry computer interface and Parker's intrepid housewife. Both aren't in enough.

The story tries to punch home the relevance of the modern-day nuclear family and how each member of the fam has something to contribute. But life lessons aren't as effectively imparted when presented this poorly. The film is wanting in real emotion and heart and anything really memorable. Yeah, it's probably a win with the younger kids because there are splashes of color and obvious sight gags and over-the-top cartoon figures to induce tons of chortling. But older kids who'd already seen better, wittier versions of this plot and these themes may come down with a sudden case of the yawns. The secondary characters come off as tacked on as if in a last-second effort to service the floundering narrative. Okay, I did like the aliens that sound like the Beatles.

2.5 out of 5 stars for this mindless distraction. It tries to cater to the grown-ups with a barrage of pop-culture references, jokes that'll fly over the heads of the young 'uns. This works only if the adult jokes were actually funny. The ones here are mostly a fail and they're even dated, but I guess Simon Cowell appreciates that some folks still think he's relevant. So, yes, see this movie if you like smug Brits in really tight tee-shirts; that actually should've been the movie's tag line.

5301050,2,B009AMAH9I,"This cartoon takes off with a fury then immediately thuds to a halt because it's a false start; 47 minutes before that point, it really starts like this..........  An insatiable braggart, Scorch Supernova (voiced by Brendan Fraser), claims great joy from needling his smarter, older brother, while ferociously pursuing popularity/fame for his daring deeds.  A rash glory seeker, Scorch prefers to ignore the fact that a great deal of what he does depends on his brother's skills back at mission control.  Skills he publically derides yet counts on.  It's a clear case of brawn over brain.  A lesson in inequality that never truly straightens itself out.  If there's a positive message in that, I fail to see it.  They even take a potshot at a ""stay at home"" mom-alien.  The military is once again the villains.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a cartoon populated with brightly colored one dimensional characters locked in a sketchy disorientated action plot that relies too heavily on the expected.  There are no surprises in this movie.  This is about as generic as it gets.

Also I did not like the need to know the gender of the aliens who sounded like the Beatles. There are a lot of a-sexual lifeforms on this planet. My sister's child is gender neutral and comments like that just reinforce the assumption that everything outside of the norm is bad.

Aside from that it was a funny movie.",1378684800,,469,4.453488372093023

5301504,4,B009AMAH9I,"Fun. Good family film with the usual left wing programming that is nearly inescapable in kids animation these days. The programming: Evil white general seeking to take over the universe and destroy/enslave that which is foreign to him. Not to mention global warming, evolution (watch Darwin's Dilemma and get your eyes opened ; )  , dislike in general for mankind, and that the animals (in this case dinosaurs) are better than we are. Funny thing is the left wants to tell you what is and isn't ok to think and do in just about every area of life, and if you disagree with them you are a knuckle dragging troglodyte. Anyway, time to step off the soapbox as I have digressed. Basically, if you agree with or are willing to ignore and or correct for your children the wrong headed and ad nauseam liberal agenda peppering the screenplay, it's pretty good.",1377475200,,852,4.642384105960265

Filled with weak helpings of anachronistic in-jokes and puns, the script by Bob Barlen and director Cal Brunker turns the old invasion-from-outer-space scenario on its head by depicting it from the aliens' viewpoint. But nothing very interesting or clever is done with it, so we wind up bored for most of the duration. More lethargy-prone five-year-olds might be entertained by it though.",1376265600,,695,5.27027027027027

5302064,3,B009AMAH9I,"A bit weak on the plot, but good casting on the voices (William Shatner was an inspired choice), and fairly well done overall.  A good excuse for popcorn!",1375228800,,154,4.5
5302065,3,B009AMAH9I,"We come in piece. This is the first animated movie from 2013 that I have watched. As well as this being the first animated movie off 2013, which was released. Well I don't know how to start this review. I can kinda tell you that this is sort of a ""Planet 51"" kinda take. It's different from Planet 51, but only in who goes to the other planet, as in alien goes to earth, instead of human goes to mars deal. Escape from Planet Earth, I never actually thought the movie was ever going to be released, I mean I've heard about it scent's 2010. That's a long time. I thought this movie was going to be shelved, which thankfully it wasn't. The movie was sold off to audiences as an actually funny movie, which according to me and my father (who viewed the movie with me) was a lie. This movie is not that funny. The only thing I found funny was in the trailer which showed the alien voiced by Craig Robinson, eating something and burping, which actually was a deleted scene. Talk about false advertisement. Well anyways let me do the honors by  giving off the problems with the film, they include  the voice cast, jokes, dialog alignment with characters mouths, plot,  product advertisements, and characters.  The voice cast. Wow, I never ever thought I'd criticize a freaking voice cast, but I did have issues with the voice cast, not everyone, just some. I mean everyone works, but I think the voice cast could have been chosen better. Ok, I mean this is something that gets me angry, you have really talented unknown voice actors, who would better perfect the characters but instead you pick up a bunch of random known actors who have NO idea how to voice act, and throw them into the movie. That's what I hate about it. Studios all ways do this. They think it will get people to see the movie, which it will but...... you know what I mean? I have no issues with Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, Steve Zahn, and William Shatner. But it's the random addition of actors like Craig Robinson, George Lopez (who isn't horrible, but could have been replaced), Jane Lynch (yes, I know I loved her in Wreck it Ralph but not in this), and Sofia Vergara. The others are all ok they are not perfect, and could have been replaced but I didn't feel they needed to be mentioned. Craig Robinson, as the alien, named Doc, who is a neat, small little mousey alien. I felt Craig didn't fit the small little, cared, furry ball that Doc, is. And George Lopez, who had previous voice work, could have been replaced as well.  Jane Lynch, while her voice fit in well in ""Wreck it Ralph"", she doesn't sound right as an alien, and it's just comes out  ridicules as alien IO.  And as for Sofia Vergara, she is horrible as the alien love interest to Brendon Fresher's Scorch Supernova. Her voice is so ugly and bland, and uninteresting; it is like ahhh, whenever her character is on screen. This movie, from the trailer looks like a decent funny kid's movie, well it's not funny. At all. I never laughed once, during the movie. The only thing I think anyone would find funny is when the fat guy's towel is  blow off, revealing his doddle and butt. But even that isn't that funny. My dad who watched with uncomfortable eyes kept a straight face threw out the movie, and my dad is the kind of guy who laughs at a lot of stuff. It's sad really. This is new too. I really had trouble  with watching the movie because, the characters lips talked and shut and the dialog would come out right when the mouth is shut, and it's very distracting, and a sign of poor work, from the animators. That was annoying for me.  This plot is a simple, - strong guy gets stuck somewhere, and weaker one has got to save him. It's a basic, kid friendly plot, which isn't always that good. I've seen that plot a million times over before. But little kids will love it. Man! I never thought a movie could feature so much product advertisement! I mean Escape from Planet Earth features a lot of product placement for 7 Eleven.  I mean both aliens, end up landing and going near 7 Eleven and one walks on in and get's a slushy from two alien fanatics. I have no idea what this has to do with the movie but... ok? That was annoying. These characters are one dimensional basically. Almost every character is thinly written out, and has no back story, basically. It makes for a less spectacular journey. Now onto the good things this movie was able to pick up they include, the animation, and Rob Corddry. The animation in this film is beautifully rendered. I mean everything looks beautiful, I mean like the ship, that Scorch travels in at the beginning is beautiful. Everything is so well detailed, it's crazy. I mean the 7 Eleven is well done as well. Even the slurpee used in the film glimmers. The alien planet ""Baab"" looks magnificent! Everything is brightly colored and lit well; it's very cool to look at. That is something kids would enjoy. Lots of eye candy to look at. Very - Very beautiful.  Rob Corddry. Man, that guy, was (for me) an excellent choice for the voice of Scorch Supernova's older, and over shadowed brother Gary Supernova. Rob, put an extra effort into molding Gary's voice, to perfection. Rob Corddry is an actor to lookout for cause he's excellent in almost every role he's in. He's a star to be! His voice is excellent. It adds flesh and tone to the character that is Gary.  All in All, I know that I said a lot of bad things about this movie, but most of it is miner and is over shadowed. This film may be best for little kid's, and was made more to attract money than to attract decent rating, but it's not the worst animated movie out there now a days.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Escape From Planet Earth has a pleasingly retro title, the kind that evokes 1950s black-and-white B-movies, UFOs on bits of string, paper-mach&eacute; alien costumes, classic Sunday afternoon telly stuff. Although there's plenty of familiar references to the usual Area 51 archetypes, this yarn of aliens and UFOs is a decidedly modern affair, a zippy, hollow-but-harmless animated adventure in the Ice Age/Monsters vs Aliens mould, a half-term multiplex-filler and little more. Escape From Planet Earth is a kind of parallel universe to Planet 51, the 2009 animated comedy centring on an astronaut marooned on an alien world and his struggle to get home. The plot of the animation film is nearly identical to that of the earlier film, except everything is flipped. Here, the astronaut is a blue-skinned E.T. named Scorch Supernova (voice of Brendan Fraser) who has been captured by the U.S. military. After crash-landing in Area 51, Scorch is captured by the U.S. military, which throws him into a holding facility, along with every other little green man (and woman) who has ever had the misfortune to run out of dilithium crystals in the Nevada desert.

More often than not, when a film is released in the 3D format, you'll read a review that says the additional dimension adds nothing to one's enjoyment. However, when it comes to 'Escape From Planet Earth,' the fun almost exclusively comes from seeing it in the 3D version. In fact, I'll go as far as to say not to even waste your time with, but if you feel you will not going to view it in 3D, then this review will not be very relevant to reading any further, but sadly if you are not keen on viewing 3D films, then you will be missing out on a fantastic 3D animation film.

Directed by first-timer Carl Brunker, 'Escape From Planet Earth' is another computer animated childrens film that seems to struggle sometimes whether it wants to be a 1950's B-movie spoof or a feel-good family film. The films opens with viewers being introduced to two blue-coloured alien brothers and they are Gary Supernova [Rob Corddry] Scorch Supernova's older brother and the head of mission control at BASA and the dimmer Scorch Supernova [Brendan Fraser] Gary's younger, stronger, brother, who is an arrogant but benevolent space pilot. Although they're brothers, they're essentially the Woody and Buzz Lightyear of this animation film. Scorch has just returned from rescuing some babies from a hostile planet, when it's learned that the next mission will be to the ""dark planet,"" which turns out to be Earth. After a disagreement, however, Gary tells Scorch he's quitting, leaving Scorch to go to Earth by himself. He isn't there long before he's kidnapped by government agents and something that Gary and the residents of his planet are able to view back home on their version of the news.

Gary decides to go to Earth to try and rescue his brother, but he isn't there long before he's captured himself and put into one of the holding cells in Area 51. He learns of a plan by General William T. Shanker (no bonus points for guessing who the voice actor is here!) to use a weapon to destroy Gary's and other captured aliens' home worlds. The second half of the animation involves Gary and his new alien friends [Craig Robinson, George Lopez, and Jane Lynch] attempting to thwart the General's plans, rescue his brother, and of course escape from planet Earth.

While the plot is razor thin, some of the sight gags are going to be appealing for older viewers, and most involve Gary and Scorch's fish-out-of-water situation. There are a couple scenes at a 7-11 in the desert that provide a few laughs (including Gary getting his first taste of a Slurpee), as well as a series of Area 51 jokes that will bring a smile to the face of all the Fox Mulders fans watching this 3D Blu-ray.

A few humorous moments appeal to adults, and we wished for more of them. Theres a an industrial, black-and-white documentary on planet Earth, where the residents of Baab learn that the Dark Planet is the only one in the universe thats de-evolving, starting with the intelligent, gentle dinosaurs to a race of humans who war with each other. The Baab-ians also learn that the Dark Planets inhabitants choose their leaders by picking those with weird facial hair (showing illustrations of Fidel Castro and others).

Escape from Planet Earth has a great cast, but there are too many characters with too little to do. Sof&iacute;a Vergara, who voices Scorchs girlfriend reporter Gabby Babblebrock, is largely onscreen to be kissed by the valiant hero each time he returns from a mission. We would have rather also seen more of the three little floating aliens that do the generals bidding. (Its not until the end that we find out that one of them sounds like a dead ringer for Ringo Starr.) Whats largely missing from the film are the compelling heroes that kids and adults will root for and despite the films huge team of writers, ultimately, viewers don't have a vested interest in either Gary or Scorch.

But the real way to view 'Escape From Planet Earth' is in the awesome 3D Blu-ray, as the film takes full advantage of the format by throwing some stunning visuals at viewers, even when the storyline is less than engaging. The movie has fun at both shooting things out at the audience while providing the kind of depth and clarity that 3D aficionados love. The 3D version is presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio (instead of the more opened-up 2:39:1 of the 2D version), so the filmmakers can make use of the black top and bottoms of the screen to enhance the 3D presentation. At times, snowflakes, explosions, lasers, and even parts of characters will overlap into the black portions of the image to give a little added fun to the 3D image. For those of you who remember the flying fish scene in the 3D version of Ang Lee's `Life of Pi,' that's the best way to describe how 'Escape From Planet Earth' has fun with its 3D presentation.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The real incentive for getting this Blu-ray title is to view the film in 3D, and Anchor Bay has given viewers a top-notch transfer, full of bright colours and sharp details. Granted, as is the case with all 3D viewing, people say the 3D glasses are going to dim the picture a bit, but here in the UK, watching this 3D Blu-ray on my Samsung 46 Smart 3D Television with my Samsung 3D Glasses, as there is none of that diming problem, but as the 3D Blu-ray goes, this is one of the BEST animated titles I own. If you're looking to show off the brilliant 3D capabilities on your television, this comes close to reference quality. Equally impressive is the 2D version, even though I think all the fun of the animation film comes from watching it in the 3D Blu-ray. Once again, a near reference quality transfers here, with no complaints and plenty of simply gorgeous animated shots. It's a shame the script didn't quite live up to the animation effort, because visually-speaking the animation film is pretty stunning.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is active and immersive, although not nearly to the degree that the action is on-screen. As one can imagine, the animation film is packed with swooping spaceships, big fight sequences, and a lot of opportunities to have fun with the soundtrack. However, while all the speakers get plenty of activity, most of the directionality and rear speaker use is on the subdued side. Which is to say, it's present, but doesn't always provide the ""oomph"" you'd expect. Even with those minor complaints, the track is well-balanced, especially the spoken dialogue, music, and background sounds are properly mixed and there are no apparent defects like popping, hissing, or other issues. Where the audio is concerned, is that viewers will only get one soundtrack option per disc, with the 3D and 2D Blu-ray disc giving us an 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, while the DVD sports a 5.1 Dolby Digital track. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish, but only for the 2D versions of the animation film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Cal Brunker: The only noteworthy bonus for those over the age of 12 is this feature-length commentary from the director. While not always screen-specific, Cal Brunker does provide some nice insights into the development of the movie, although he spends just as much time often commenting about what the characters motivations are in certain scenes. Like a lot of commentary tracks, this one was recorded shortly before the film's theatrical release, so listeners won't get any feedback here about the animation films performance, and critical reception.

Special Feature: The Making of 'Escape From Planet Earth' [2013] [1080p] [21:00] While this behind the scenes documentary does contain comments/interview footage with most of the main cast, it's sadly little more than a fluff piece and extended advertisement for the film.

Special Feature: Alternate Takes & Deleted Scenes [2013] [1080p] [4:00] This collection of deleted scenes (some of them are only seconds long) just seems to be an excuse to present all of the completed but unused animation. There's nothing here that didn't deserve to get cut from the final product.

Special Feature: How To Make An Animated Feature With Director Cal Brunker [2013] [1080p] [4:00] A short little documentary on how an animated film goes from storyboarding to pre-visualisation to animation to compositing/final product.

Special Feature: Music Features [2013] [1080p] [11:00] Broken up into three segments (which can be watched together or separately), this segment gives viewers the music video for ""Shooting Star"" by Owl City; an introduction by Delta Rae followed by a performance of ""What Matters Most"" and then a segment from Cody Simpson about his song ""Shine Supernova"" which features highlights of the song, but never the full song itself.

Finally, `Escape from Planet Earth' has a lot of fun exploring its characters and universe. Even if the film isn't a bastion of originality, it takes itself very lightly. It's a buoyant, bubbly, happy-go-lucky sort of movie that just rolls with limited range and cleverly mixes together its pieces into an animation film that feels familiar but at the same time rather fresh. It's not an instant classic of its genre, but chances are younger ones will love it and parents with a Sci-Fi itch to scratch will enjoy it, too. Anchor Bay's 3D and 2D Bu-ray combo release of `Escape from Planet Earth' features tip-top video, excellent audio and amazing few extras. If you read other peoples reviews, they say this is a very mediocre, well that is such tosh, as this it totally brilliant 3D animation and I loved every minute and was brilliant fun and I cannot find any fault with it and you will be a fool to pass this by and I am so proud to add this to my ever increasing animation Blu-ray Collection and especially 3D Blu-ray discs, which I really love and is a massive bonus to me personally, despite people are predicting the demise of anything to do with 3D, as at most times they look so much more superior to what 3D you see in the cinema. Highly Recommended!

With Netflix I consistently get 20+ when streaming.  I've seen it as high as 70 Mbps.

Amazon can't seem to figure out why I'm not getting HD quality streaming from them, at least they won't admit why.  I think they're just maxed out and have grown too quickly and their bandwidth/servers just can't keep up with the demand.

I did get a refund, I can't fault their customer service, I just can't recommend you pay for any Amazon Instant Video until they get their act together.

I had no real desire to see this movie (due to really poor advertising) but I picked it up from redbox anyway and gave it a go. It's very predictable but still refreshingly original and it never takes itself too seriously. It has a few slow parts and lacks a little depth and has no real emotional weight because of its simplicity and predictability but it's still very engaging.

The all star cast perform amazing voice acting with Jessica Alba, William Shatner, Bredan Fraser, Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, Sofia Vergera and Sarah Jessica Parker, I mean...you really can't lose.

We have just about every Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks movie I can think of and this has been the first she has actually watched entirely, then she even asks to have it on again.  I'm not one of those who looks for originality in kids movies or some unexpected twists,  so I was perfectly satisfied watching it with its quick pace and humor with plenty of stereotypical puns. With all the kids movies out there,  of course your going to find some common themes,  but ultimately it does well seperating itself from what we have already seen.
