8253289,5,B0013XZ2W4,An art form of cinema I have never seen the likes of before. Outlandish as if Dali had created the story. I love it.,1378857600,,116,3.875
8253290,4,B0013XZ2W4,"This set was a good purchase ( i purchased it for 6 bucks!) you really cant go wrong with 4 shows on 4 dvds! Each dvd is about 2 hours in legnth and is an enjoyable time, if you like good lucha libre american action then buy this dvd! (everythings IN ENGLISH by the way!)",1332633600,,271,3.9454545454545453
8253291,4,B0013XZ2W4,"Here's a 4-pack of independent wrestling DVDs that are also available individually, so if you like at least two of these DVDs it makes more sense to buy the boxed set and sample what you like from the other DVDs. All the DVDs are in English, half of them are NWA events, and each DVD has an exciting match with el Hijo del Santo. Despite the presence of several matches with well-known luchadores such as L.A. Park, Blue Demon Jr., Super Parka, and Rey Misterio Sr. (and despite a title like Luchamania) all these matches are in the United States and feature at least 50% old-school American-style wrestling. So, if you're buying this expecting nonstop CMLL or AAA-style lucha libre you might be disappointed.

""Dia De Los Muertes"" has some of the best production values - including clever graphics and original instrumental music - you'll ever see in an independent DVD, and a brutal cage match between L.A. Park and Santo. ""Copa de Lucha"" has a great card and consistently high quality matches and is probably my favorite out of the four discs. The Eddie Guerrero DVD has the most lucha libre action of the four, with an all-star card including a great match between L.A. Park and Super Parka, and the always amusing Mascarita Sagrada. But you won't see even documentary footage of Eddie in the main event, and Rey Misterio Jr only appears in bonus matches available elsewhere! ""Fiesta Lucha"" was the weakest of the set, to me, because it tried to emulate the WWE-style of interviewing the talent before the matches rather than follow the straight-up, old-school style of NWA and the opening matches were relatively weak.

So, now's your chance to see what wrestling is like outside of the WWE!",1289692800,4,1696,4.76530612244898
