At least SOME effort had gone into ""Dropping in on Picasso"" and ""Dropping in on Rousseau"" which felt much more like real real cartoons with characters and jokes, but this was a totally different with a much cheaper style of animation, and the transfer was crummy too.  Whereas I had shown 15 minutes of the other DVDs in this series, I skipped ahead to the last five minutes of this one, just to show the ""drawing with scissors"" part, which was only a bit better than me showing the artwork and talking about it.  Definitely not worth $30.",1334448000,2,629,4.548672566371682
7796347,2,156290342X,"Dropping in on Matisse is a fair watch for a short film, but 30 dollars???? There is way too much fluff in the lines (too much bantering about nothing), and I preferred the film to concentrate more on the works of Henri Matisse. Yet there are way way too many paintings missing from the film that weren't covered because of the fluffiness in the conversation between the cartoon characters of Matisse and the penguin. The best part of the film is the analysis of the few paintings by Matisse, but like I wrote...way too few of them covered. Another worst part of the film is how little of Matisse's history is covered. All in all, I was disappointed.",1268784000,5,650,4.516949152542373
