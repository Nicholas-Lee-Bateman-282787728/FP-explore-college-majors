8165552,5,B000M06GNS,"I love this program.  I rank this program up there with MASH, not because of content, but due to the fact that I can watch these episodes any time they are on.  They are well written and have a great well-defined ensemble cast.  Since this program is only available on my local PBS station, these DVD sets are a great way to view these programs.

I prefer to get these in the British PAL format, and highly recommend anyone purchasing these to check the sellers description closely to determine whether they will work in their DVD player.",1393632000,,538,4.515463917525773
