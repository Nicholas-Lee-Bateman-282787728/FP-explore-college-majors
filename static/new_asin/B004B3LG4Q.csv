8421475,5,B004B3LG4Q,I have been a Duke and thereafter all Dodgers fan since I was six years old.  I am thrilled to have hin featured in the most of these segments.  I grieve Ebbets Field and want to get fans together to get Gil and Peewee in the halls of Cooperstown.  Gil especially !!!!!!!!!!!!  The Boys of Summer are long over due to be in that place of reverence for real stars at the game.,1454803200,,375,4.095890410958904

These were the days when baseball opened the barriers of racism and Jackie Robinson became a Brooklyn Dodger. Important piece of baseball history.",1419120000,,324,4.803571428571429
