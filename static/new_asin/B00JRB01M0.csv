6389376,5,B00JRB01M0,"Octonauts: Deep Sea Mission is the newest DVD release in the series, and just when I thought the show couldn't get any more clever- it does! I have to start by saying that the creature reports are a wonderful learning tool. Using short rhyming songs, Captain Barnacles and the team recap the fun facts that are presented in the episode as kind of a summary of sorts. I really appreciate that my kids are learning about unique creatures of the deep, but at the same time, I am equally impressed by how much they enjoy the show for it's pure entertainment value! The silly characters get into some pretty funny situations that leave my children laughing time and time again. On this DVD, kids learn about the vampire squid, gulper eels, blobfish, spookfish, the long-armed squid, worms and an underwater volcano. We have only had this DVD for a little over a week, and they have watched it 3 times now. It has been viewed in the car, at grandma's house and in the comfort of our living room. I anticipate that it will be viewed many more times in the months to come. My kids can't seem to get enough of the Octonauts, and I like the fact that they are learning and having fun at the same time. It's a win-win situation!

6389377,5,B00JRB01M0,"I received a free copy of this new release for review, but I was not required to write a positive review. These opinions are my own.
I love this DVD since it is an entertaining way for my kiddos, my 6 year old son especially, to learn more about little known creatures of the deep. Through 6 fun adventures the Octonauts take your kids down to the deepest depths of the ocean. In this DVD they learn about more than just marine life. They also touch on underwater volcanoes, which I think is really cool. Plus a few other interesting facts about the deep ocean that I had never heard of myself. Really neat.
If you are looking for quality entertainment for your kids that keeps them learning, after viewing this DVD with my children I recommend the Octonauts: Deep Sea Mission.",1410652800,,777,4.47887323943662
6389378,5,B00JRB01M0,Great Adventures packed with neat new animals! My son and I loved this dvd! And it's perfect for the Halloween season with the new spooky creatures they rescue! It's fun for the whole family! I would definitely recommend this dvd!,1410566400,,230,4.775
6389379,4,B00JRB01M0,"Who's ready for a little bit of fun? Adventure? Or even better - some underwater adventures? The Octonauts definitely fit this description, and this August they released another top-notch DVD! Octonauts: Deep Sea Mission is the perfect combination of fun, education and adventure. From beginning to end the DVD teaches kids about life in the ocean, or more specifically, in this DVD it teaches kids (and parents! *wink*) about what it's like in the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean - the midnight zone!

Our children are BIG fans of the Octonauts and were thrilled to bits when this DVD arrived in the mail. They were introduced to some deep sea creatures for the first time, including the Vampire Squid and the Gulper Eels. The underwater volcano and the darkness of this underwater world add just enough adventure & mystery to the DVD as well. A few of our children were a bit frightened by the last episode (where they hear a strange sound in the water...and discover that it is an ocean creature in need of help), but all ended well with the episode...guess it was just a bit too much suspense for a few of our sensitive little ones! Either way, personally, I thought the Octonauts DVD was great. It is a wonderful way for children and families to be able to explore the world's oceans without having to leave the comfort of your own home.

Since we are a homeschooling family, I'm looking forward to adding some Octonaut videos into our curriculum! Visual learning works well for many children, and there is enough information in the Octonaut episodes that you could even have you child write you a short report about what they learned in each episode. Whether you want to turn the Octonauts DVD's into some at-home learning, or whether you simply want to have something kid-friendly, fun and educational for your kids to watch, the Octonauts: Deep Sea Mission is a great DVD to have on your shelves or even to give as a gift!",1409961600,3,1934,4.685294117647059
6389380,5,B00JRB01M0,"I am a Nsider so I was provide a review copy of this DVD
Each episode focuses on a sea creature that can only be found in the deep sea!  My boys loved meeting all the new sea creatures and learning fun facts.  My oldest is really into animals and sea creatures.  Last week we were in Back-To-School mode.  As we watched the DVD he kept telling me that he can't wait to go to first grade and tell them what a squid can do!  He was so intrigued with everything and it was fun see him discover all these fun new facts.  He was excited with each new fact he learned.  My youngest is 3 and for right now he doesn't absorb as much as my oldest does.  For him its important that the episodes are also fun and engaging and Octonauts are all of the above :)
They are full of science facts and nonstop fun!",1408665600,,796,3.9936708860759493

6389409,4,B00JRB01M0,"My 3 year old is afraid of 2 episodes on here:  the Vampire Squid and the Long-armed Squid.  Otherwise, she likes this DVD.  The creepiness factor is apparent in this DVD (after all, it's the Deep Sea, the Midnight Zone....), but (I thought) it was just enough for preschoolers.  Especially because the ""creepy"" factor is toned down with humor, but I guess my daughter is a little more timid.",1416528000,,392,4.63768115942029
