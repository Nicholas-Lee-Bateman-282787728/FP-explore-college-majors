7108616,5,B00VTBAW52,"A fitting tribute to the legendary Miss King, with some excellent interpretations of some of her greatest compositions, including many written with brilliant lyricist (and King's first husband), Gerry Goffin. Lady Gaga surprises with a superb
version of You've Got a Friend, and Alicia Keys
sets a new standard in her amazing rendition of Natural Woman. Great for long time King fans, or just fans of great pop music.",1443830400,,417,5.057971014492754

7108628,5,B00VTBAW52,"I look forward to MusiCares concerts each year because they pair up performers you wouldn't expect to hear together and performers with songs not their typical style. This creative risk has paid off often, perhaps never better than at the King tribute. For me, it's worth the DVD price just to hear the glorious version of Beautiful that Sara Bareilles, Zac Brown, Jason Mraz and Raining Jane make their own.

I have seen most of the MusiCares concerts and this one tops my list for several reasons. First, all of the performers (not just those mentioned above) bring their own interpretations to the songs. Sadly, during some tribute concerts performers just seem to be trying to replicate the original version.

Second, Carole King is the most versatile of the musicians thus far honored. Her career spans over 50 years, with styles ranging from pop, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, soul, soft rock, to adult contemporary. Happily, this concert presents all these styles, creating quite the variety. There's something here for just about everybody which is why her songs work for Steven Tyler as well as for Gloria Estafan, Pink, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keyes, Jennifer Nettles and will.i.am.

Third, Carole King is a composer first, a performer second. This is one reason why her styles have varied so: she has written for a multitude of performers whose genres have been quite different from her own performing style which has primarily been soft rock. As a composer, she revels in seeing her work performed which is oh-so-obvious on this DVD. She's dancing, cheering, singing along, tearing up and exhibiting absolute delight in hearing how her songs have been interpreted. Not once does she seem territorial. It's clear, if anything, that she'd like to be jamming with them, not instead of them. Even at the end when she is performing, she shows clear reverence for her collaborators, particularly James Taylor and Tom Scott.

There's one last reason why this DVD is such a treasure. Unlike previous MusiCares tributes, individual performances from this concert haven't shown up on YouTube. I know because I unfortunately missed the televised concert and have been checking YouTube for a year and a half, hoping at least one song would be posted since the reviews had indicated that this was not a concert to be missed. I could not agree more and highly recommend this DVD to any Carole King fan who wants to experience this amazing concert along with her.",1438819200,7,2457,4.941888619854722

8711138,1,B00VTBAW52,"Terrible.  Gerry Goffin, may he rest in peace, should have been happy he wasn't there--and James Taylor should be happy too because if I were Gerry, I'd want to kick his you know what for screwing up the lyrics to HEY GIRL and messing around so much with the lyric of UP ON THE ROOF.  And Miranda Lambert took one of my favorites, IT MIGHT AS WELL RAIN UNTIL SEPTEMBER, and ruined the melody--she wasn't improvising--she obviously didn't know the melody.  And I was bored with today's 'big' names doing the same old songs.  A waste of time & money.",1458604800,,548,4.45
