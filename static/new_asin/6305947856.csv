1093026,2,6305947856,"Niche market mfrs. such as TROMA ENTERTAINMENT offer no commentary, deleted scenes, subtitles or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.

TWISTED JUSTICE is a very low-budget crime drama set in a Los Angeles of the future, a city where firearms are outlawed. Even the police cannot carry weapons more formidable than airguns with tranquilizer darts (called 'stingers'). One officer though ignores the law and is not afraid to shoot to kill any criminal who endangers human life, especially his own. He is of course the hero of our story, played with some brio by writer/director David Heavener.

A potentially good concept is badly hampered by surprisingly amateurish performances from several 'name' actors, all of whom have done better work. Characters are cartoonish, lines delivered in over-the-top fashion, sets decorated from a Dollar Store, with hand-lettered signs standing in for professionally stenciled ones. Our hero cop's room is 70s college dorm, with walls that display purloined freeway signs in lieu of artwork, mirrors or anything hinting of good taste.

The audio mix is bizarre. Repetitive electronically-generated music and all sound effects are in stereo while voices get isolated to extreme left channel only, thus dialogue seems remote and at times hard to understand.

Despite all these drawbacks, action sequences are well-executed and are the only saving grace of what often seems a C+ student film. Only for action movie completists.

7898123,2,6305947856,"SERIOUSLY!!! this one; of many, of the worst movie's ever. I thought by having well known actor's in this movie that it would be good. I couldn't finish watching this movie cause it's STUPID!! Please don't waste your time; unless you have ""time"" to waste then by all means watch it, watching this.",1498262400,,297,4.622641509433962
7898124,1,6305947856,"In the futuristic Los Angeles of 2010 where weapons are outlawed, policeman James Tucker (played by David Heavener, who also written, directed & produced this) kicks it old-school by using the tactics that other cops won't as he tracks down a drug-addicted rapist/killer all the while arguing with his boss Gage (Erik Estrada)

This film was just painful to watch, and thanks to Heavener wearing so many hats in this production I know who exactly to blame for that. Horrible stilted dialog, awful 'action' sequences and atrocious acting made this pathetic little number a chore to sit through from beginning to end. Almost as bad as an action movie can get.

7898128,2,6305947856,"Two stars does not mean unwatchable. You figure, what is this cheap B-movie doing in Amazon Prime that's not made by Troma, and who is this Heavener guy in the leading role among a cast featuring Erik Estrada, Jim Brown and Shannon Tweed? Yeah, definitely B-movie. Heaven is actually a hollywood player and music producer according to his wiki, and plays this role with some confidence and distinction, like he's familiar with the cop-movie type he wants to emulate. He is convincing filthy and unkempt sleeping in a bathtub with a pet rat as his house is repeatedly ransacked by thug cops. The plot is kind of ridiculous and pointless without much payoff, but still...you could do worse.",1461974400,,688,4.838983050847458
