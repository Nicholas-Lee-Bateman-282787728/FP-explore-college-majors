5915315,5,B009CK9PVE,"Great acting (especially Zachary Green), the writing was amazing for such a small budget flick... the story holds your attention all the way through and walks a very narrow line between sloppy and unpredictable. In other words, every time I thought the story was meandering, it turned out it was just headed into a place I didn't anticipate. I like it when a movie doesn't just fall into predicable traps. Well done to all involved.",1378252800,,432,4.773333333333333
5915316,5,B009CK9PVE,"I saw The Scam at a premium in Cleveland.  I think it was surprisingly good since it is an independent movie.  The lead character, Luke, was played by actor Zachary Green.  He was amazing.  He was the stand out.  He was such a natural in the part.  He is effortless, believable, funny, and strong.  He worked great with the supporting actors.  I would love to see more of him in the future.",1356652800,,390,4.319444444444445
5915317,5,B009CK9PVE,"I enjoyed this movie. The plot was well thought out. Within minutes I had forgot it was a low budget film. Tommy is the best character in the movie. He was witty, sporadic and down to earth cool. I highly recommend this movie.",1352419200,,226,4.27906976744186
8605661,3,B009CK9PVE,Not awful but not great. Watchable if you can't find anything else.,1530921600,,67,4.666666666666667
8605662,3,B009CK9PVE,"Ok! Another Amazon original movie, yes, it is a movie. It has all the components; actors that follow a script, videography, a music score, etc. Except none of those parts are actually good in this ""movie"", which seems to be an Amazon trend. I mean the plot was sort of cool and there is some appealing cast members (needed more Grace). But generally everything else about this is terrible. Yet somehow captivating enough to finish, rate 3 stars and write my first movie review! Check it out if you're bored but not if you are interested in watching a ""good movie"".",1528675200,,564,4.594059405940594
8605663,2,B009CK9PVE,"The movie could have been a lot better. The plot was ok but they definitely ran out of money in the budget in this one. It just ends and leaves you with that ""ripped off"" feeling. It's like the director said ""ok enough is enough this movie sucks and it's over.""",1516665600,,261,4.137254901960785
8605664,4,B009CK9PVE,"The movie was pretty good, the ending was great.",1512604800,,48,4.444444444444445
8605665,1,B009CK9PVE,skip this one.... boring with poor acting....,1511049600,,45,5.571428571428571
8605666,3,B009CK9PVE,"Did not like the ending, too abrupt and was somewhat disappointed.",1510012800,,66,5.090909090909091

8605668,3,B009CK9PVE,"it is a low budget film, but it is not bad really. Some of the acting is a little weak. At least they had short parts. Main actors did a okay job. Pretty much a name film. I enjoyed it. Interesting plot, and moved alone kind of quickly. Didn't like the BLM view of the entire government being tossed in. This dropped my view of the film 1 star.",1507161600,,344,4.0
8605669,2,B009CK9PVE,"Terrible acting by all involved (quite a feat), amateur production values, badly delivered, clumsy dialog. And that's just in the first 5 minutes. Looks like the whole thing was shot on an iPhone, and not the latest model. Even the music is inappropriate for the scenes it's meant to enhance. Premise is interesting, but the execution is excruciating.",1507161600,2,351,5.068965517241379
8605670,2,B009CK9PVE,"Could not watch after about 30 min.
Poor script, poor dialogue, low production values, and sub-par acting.
I guess since this isn't a big budget production with all star names, that's to be expected, but the high rating shown on Amazon is a shill. Don't waste your time.",1505433600,4,270,4.645833333333333
