2604433,4,B000GBEWIO,"Summer Storm is certainly one of the finer coming out films. The cast is excellent and the portayals have an emotional honesty that is often lacking in gay cinema. However, there are flaws that keep this from being a 5-star film. Some times the director chooses to avoid conversation and confrontation that would have added to the story. Some shots are heavy-handed with symbolism. Finally, the lead character is a selfish one and never apologizes for the emotional and physical pain he causes. This, though, is much like real life and so is a sad element that was probably intended. Otherwise, a film worthy of being on any gay man's shelf.",1157673600,8,641,4.783783783783784
2604434,4,B000GBEWIO,"This film was significant in Germany because Robert Stadlober is a popular young actor and band member there whose coming out in the character of Tobi was unsettling. Certainly Kostja Ullmann as Achim, his buddy and secret love, is cute enough to win many hearts. And his pretend love interest, Alicja Bachleda-Curus as Anke, is sweet and beautiful enough to convince nearly anyone that being gay is NOT a lifestyle choice.

When another rowing team bold enough to call themselves the QueerStrokes (which actually exists) shows up, Tobi gets to see the spectrum of gay characters, from manly Malte to effeminate Nils; and Marlon Kittel as Leo sure takes in an eyeful of Tobi as he bides his time. Seeking refuge from a raging storm (and from an increasingly stormy relationship with Achim) in a closed hostel building brings some closer together, and drives others apart.

There isn't much new for American audiences in that there have been a number of equally well done coming out films here, but Summer Storm rings true because it is at least partly autobiographical for director and writer Marco Kreuzpaintner, and Stadtlober and Ullmann certainly have chemistry together to spare as mates. In fact the whole crew seemed to be having a really good time.

The film ends with Tobi arriving home from the summer rowing camp a changed boy. Stepping off the bus and facing his front door his stern look changes to a faint smile. A small touch, but a reason Robert Stadtlober has won awards, and why the film will win acclaim.",1157241600,102,1523,4.827586206896552

2604445,5,B000GBEWIO,"This is not a coming of age movie as such and even though if is a ""gay"" movie because of the subject.  It is more of a coming of acceptance of a young man named Toby ( Robert Stadlober) that he is gay.  He has had deep feelings for his friend Achim (Kostja Ullmann) for as long as he can remember.  When they wrestle and he gets an erection, they both masturbate with Achim thinking of his girlfriend and Toby thinking of him.  they are both on a rowing team and when the team goes to a summer camp to prepare for a race, they meet a team called ""Queerstrokes"" simply because they are all gay and are proud of who they are and not afraid of straight reaction..  The story is about the angst this young man goes through in trying to figure out who and what he is.  He spends time with the Queerstrokes crew and realizes he is happy without pretending.  When his his girlfriend who he is basically seeing as show for his team mates  tries to get him to have sex with her, he finally tells her he can't because he is in love with another, with a boy. When a summer storm hits the camp and they seek shelter in a near-by hostel and the word is out that he's gay, he is rejected by his team mates as no one wants to share a room with him.  He finds solace with one of the gay team members and the next day announces to his team mates that he is indeed gay; . It is well played by all.  The last scene when he comes home and gets off the bus the look on his face tells it all in that he is now past his angst, has accepted himself and no longer has to pretend to be be what he is not. I give this a solid 5 stars and recommend it.",1407888000,2,1624,3.9088145896656536

2604448,5,B000GBEWIO,"It is a film about young athletes in competition, and real life confrontations that stir up. A fair example of how people feel about things they may not understand so they opt to dislike and even may hate. But these individuals seem to me more prone to acceptance which is a good sign when it comes to the evolution of the human mind. Homosexuality may not be easily understood by some, but it sure does seem to be making a statement more frequently these days and more people seem to be ""OK"" with it! SUMMER STORM is a great statement type film and I would expect anyone that watches it will in turn become much more comfortable with homosexuality. It's a superb film of understanding and acceptance. I know that myself and other gay folks out there feel GAY PRIDE from this film. VERY proud to see films like this one released. Important film ! ....AWESOME :)",1398643200,,861,4.490445859872612

2604450,5,B000GBEWIO,"Only in Germany would you find a high school all-boy's gay rowing team mixed amongst all the other teams. Unabashed, one of its members helps another boy find himself and come out. It's another beautifully tender tale of young people learning about who they are and accepting themselves. I loved this film! Highly recommended!!",1388880000,,327,5.074074074074074
2604451,5,B000GBEWIO,This was worth the purchase. I can't begin to express how good this movie was. I can't wait to purchase more in the future.,1388793600,,123,4.166666666666667
2604452,5,B000GBEWIO,"It's not the acting (which is good) that's going to make you want to watch this, many times perhaps.

2604453,5,B000GBEWIO,"How come only the Europeans can make a half-way decent young gay movie??  This is another film that is so utterly charming, yet so true to real-life, that it hits squarely home to this person, 'DEJA VU.'  The incidents portrayed in this story line, can be found anywhere in the world.  My summer times in middle and senior school where spent in just these activities.  The older I get, the more valid the time spent is not only appreciated, but was totally worth the while.  MATURING FROM A TEENAGER TO A YOUNG ADULT TAKES GUIDANCE AND EXPERIENCE!!  NJMJr!
PS  A very beautiful film about young gay love and the two fold summer storm that takes place-metrological storm and the psychological storm of coming out!!!  NJMJr!!!",1377388800,,724,4.736

There have been other movies like it but this one appeals to many",1375142400,,151,4.428571428571429
2604455,5,B000GBEWIO,"The plot, the music and the acting were all extremely good. However, the actor who stands out among a fine cast was Marlon Kittel who played Leo. His portrayal of the character was sensitive and nuanced. His every move and every word of his script was convincing and showed extraordinary depth. The quality of his performance reminded me of a young Paul Newman.",1368835200,,361,4.746031746031746
2604456,4,B000GBEWIO,I thought this was going to be yet another gay coming age movie however it is well written and genuinely entertaining. I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.,1368403200,,168,4.827586206896552
2604457,5,B000GBEWIO,"Discovered at Here TV - there's not a flaw in this film.  Story line, characters journeys are true in all details and interest never lost watching them. Delightful merging of comedy, nostaligia, heartaches - one of the best I've seen in the coming of age genre - but the story tells much more than this. We end up loving all the characters - flawless story-telling. Music outstanding - especially the final boat race.",1364083200,,417,4.712328767123288
2604458,3,B000GBEWIO,It was okay but the concept had so much more potential and it failed to live up up to what it could have been.  I was satisfied with the movie but I'm never going to list it as one of my most recommended gay films.,1356998400,,214,3.7555555555555555
2604459,5,B000GBEWIO,"How many of us had a crush on our best friend during adolescence?  And what if those around us weren't able to point that out to us? Emerging consciousness in its developmental phases is beautifully expressed by delightful young actors.  This plot is as real as life.  In this film the clarity comes from the unexpected storms of youth, the unlikely situation when the cowboys have to compete against the sophistcated urban gay crew.  Truth sets us free with its double edged sword blade.",1355961600,,488,4.773809523809524
2604460,3,B000GBEWIO,"I thought it was a decent movie. Had your cliche stereotypes of gays being flamboyant and about guys just wanting sex etc.. what I did like was the honest portrayal of the main character's confusion and struggle to come out to his peers. It had it's funny moments and it's sympathetic ones as well. It was a good teenage coming out movie, the best way to put it.",1351900800,2,362,4.338235294117647
2604461,4,B000GBEWIO,"Although I wish I could change the ending, overall I enjoyed this film. Many times men coming out forget how others are affected especially if they are dating a girl. Adolescents is a confusing time.",1349827200,,199,4.714285714285714
2604462,4,B000GBEWIO,"The main character is a bit overplayed, causing a little disbelief on my part in watching that his homophobic best friend wouldn't suspect his buddy might have a crush on him, despite mutual masturbatory scenes and homoerotic moments.  But youngsters could be this way in Germany, I suppose, without causing a lot of suspicion.  Lots of fun and some soul searching going on, and I enjoyed the movie.  It is in German and subtitled in English (and others, I think) if that makes any difference.  I prefer the original language over dubbed audio anyway.",1323388800,2,551,4.829787234042553
2604463,4,B000GBEWIO,"Despite the same gay cliches found in almost every gay movie, summer storm is a well balanced coming to age gay movie, that nourishes your mind with a cozy happy ending.",1304985600,,169,4.483870967741935
2604464,4,B000GBEWIO,"I wanted to give this film a lower score but could not because it was well directed. The acting was well done. The cinematogrophy was well done. The music was decent. And for a gay film, that is incredible. The story was well done too but I felt the main character got off easy at times and there were some contrived situations as another poster stated.

It is a good coming out flick in some areas. And the acting and direction, etc, has a lot to do with it. But really, I think in a real world situation, the main character would be ostracized for how he acted with no feeling of remorse. Maybe it's a cultural thing.

SPOILERS * SPOILERS * SPOILERS

My problems were with how Tobi acted. He was like an immature child AND everybody seemed to feed into that. Tobi needed to apologize to several people and own up to what he did. He needed to say sorry to: his team and the gay team for starting the fight, to Anke for leading her on and telling lies about their relationship (and he should be in gratitude for her not outing him and being a good friend), to the gay dude who he slept with because he led him on as well and hurt him (and that gay dude was just too giving, but I get it, wounded bird syndrome), to his best friend for so many things.

Just because you're having problems coming out does not give one a free pass to be a child and basically a douche.",1292112000,,1366,4.162878787878788
2604465,5,B000GBEWIO,This movie takes me back a few years to when I was that age and going through the same thing.  It reminds me of my boy crushes and how fun it was in the end to have taken the journey.  This movie tells the story beautifully and with some hot boys thrown in too!  I watch it again and again and still it never gets old.  After a minute or two you forget you're reading subtitles!,1280275200,2,378,3.9342105263157894
2604466,5,B000GBEWIO,"A very tender coming of age movie, that manages to be also funny in some moments. Unfortunately, as almost all the young adult movie, there is not a clear happily ever after, but the main character, Leo, finds his path in the world.",1278288000,,232,4.4186046511627906
2604467,5,B000GBEWIO,"This movie was a pleasant surprise, although gay themed
movies from Europe seem to be handled in a more mature
manner than most American ones. When the gay team meets the
straight team, the scene is portrayed without an overstated
amount of homophobia, so prevalent in other films. The final
scene which you should see for yourself, has the central character
more at peace with himself and confident as the film ends.",1268179200,,417,4.805555555555555
2604468,4,B000GBEWIO,"Overall a nice story about a young man in Germany coming to terms with his homosexuality and how it affects his relationships with his best friend and the rest of his rowing (crew) team, as they compete for a trophy at a summer camp-out. I found some of the situations to be a little contrived and unrealistic, such as when the girl who likes him shows up on a quilt in a field right where and when he chose to run after his first gay intimate encounter with a member of a gay crew club. How could she possibly know he would run right to her?  Also, why does his erstwhile best friend decide to get intimate with his girl for the first time in the middle of a violent night-time thunderstorm in the woods, after the team has just fishished a search for a missing team member?  There are also some continuity problems, and just when you think the movie has ended there's a cutsie tacked-on post-script. But, some good acting and some very emotionally raw and real-feeling scenes among a great young cast make this movie worth a look.",1253664000,3,1032,4.397905759162303
2604469,5,B000GBEWIO,"Sommersturm was an berraschung (surprise) for me this summer.  Made in 2004, it won high honors for a brutally honest view of homosexuality in the land where Hitler once ruled.  Like ""Brokeback Mountain"", the subject of becoming aware of one's own orientation falls on the protagonist.  Even moreso, he begins to fall for his best friend, who is heterosexual.  After much denial and swirls of emotion, Tobi finally admits his real orientation.  The girl he'd been pursuing understands fully, and urges him to be true to himself.  The rest of the rowing team accepts Tobi as he accepts himself.
For contrast in the story, there is a stereotypical gay and muscular guy.  However, it is the calm and cool gay guy who proves to Tobi how sincere and real one can be.  Tobi even asks him for advice on how to cope with the reality of knowing he is gay.

Overall, I admit I bought it to hear the German, which is unfortunately spoken too fast most of the time for my ears.  Rather than reading the English subtitles and then trying to backtranslate them into German, I'd rather switch the subtitles into German and follow the story totally immersed in German.
I highly recommend this sensitive approach of a movie to any late adolescent (rated R) who's struggling with his sexuality.",1251849600,2,1276,4.707207207207207
2604470,4,B000GBEWIO,"I can't understand German and English so much. Because I'm Japanese girl. However,I like gay movie. The scene in the lake side was the most beautiful sex scene that I had seen so far. I decided purchase because I had seen the scene with YouTube. Especially Marlon Kittel is so cute!!!!!Actually, the music and the image are very beautiful overall.
Tobi loves Achim, but Achim is a straight and has a girlfriend. Tobi must behave as a straight, and suffers. I was painful when I consider his feelings. Openly gay boat team ""Queerstroker"" came to the same campground. By their appearance,various problems occur between Tobi and his friends. I have not understood details. But finally, I thought he had decided it to living as a gay. It's wonderful that he accepts it. And It seems like ""Queerstroker"" was very honest and lovely.

2604471,5,B000GBEWIO,"I first saw a trailer of this movie on You Tube.  I wasn't disappointed when I received my own copy of the film.  This is a touching story of two childhood friends that experience a wonderful and loving bond of best friendship. The twist is Tobi's love is deeper than friendship for Achim.  The feelings are not mutual however.  The frustrations they both experience almost breaks their friendship apart.  In the end, their friendship survives.",1247443200,,444,4.866666666666666
2604472,4,B000GBEWIO,"A well made movie and powerful depiction of a young man coming to grips with his love for his best friend and the rejection he faces as his best friend falls in love with a young woman.  The story's setting of a rowing camp provides a beautiful backdrop to the mounting conflict.  I must admit there's a bit of cheesiness in the final resolution, but it detracts just a little from the otherwise powerful portrayals throughout the rest of the movie.  And check out the part where the lead jumps in the lake after his best friend walks away; the cinematography was captivating, matched equally with music.  What a scene!",1243555200,,619,4.6

2604474,5,B000GBEWIO,"Despite it being rather unrealistic that one school rowing team in a competition would be entirely gay and out, this film does indeed have it's saving grace in its dealing with the emotions of being a gay youth - denial, coming out, trust and homophobia.

2604475,5,B000GBEWIO,The American version of the movie has an important scene cut which is not edited out on the British DVD - why this is so I do not know. In addition the DVD available on Amazon.co.uk has an interview with the director and co star.,1214179200,2,229,4.111111111111111
2604476,5,B000GBEWIO,"This is a member of the string of series of the ""young coming out of age movies"" like ""Beautiful Thing,"" ""Get Real,"" "" some stories in the Boys Briefs Series and the Boys Life Series,"" and many other titles involving buddies relationships with gay and straight boys. This theme with boys having crushes, and not getting what they want, growing up, and finally accepting their sexual orientation. All of them have a cast of ""cute"" straight kids. Some people are willing to accept these stories perhaps on the beauty of the actors. Others may not based on what they have experienced personally. Life is a lot harsher than what is depicted on the screen.

This is German movie with English subtitles. The movie starts with two boys jumping on a playground with the beautiful ballad ""Blond on Blond"" performed by the American Rock Band Nada Surf (which is repeated at the end of movie again.) Tobi and Achim are best friends since little. They are members of a rowing team in a town in Bavaria. Tobi is the lead for the guy's team. There is also a girl's team. They are going to a rowing competition in Berlin. Tobi has crush on Achim but he doesn't know it. Tobi is gay and Achim is straight. There is Anke who has a crush on Tobi. She is a member of the girl's team. And Sandra who has a crush on Achim.

Everybody is ready to go on the trip and all expectations are high on everybody loosing their virginities. Things get complicated when one of the other teams on the campsite are all gay boys. There is some hard treatment and dislike among Tobi's team and them. Gunther, one of the gay boys, develops a crush on Tobi. Tobi is in turmoil because of all his gay feelings coming to the surface. Anke finds out about Tobi. Achim has sex with Sandra and fights with Tobi. Gunther has some form of sex with Tobi. A storm appears in the area. Everybody takes refuge in a empty summer home. Tobi and Gunther sleep together after Tobi being kicked out of Achim's room. Tobi comes out to everybody in the morning. The gay team wins the rowing competition. And Tobi goes home a changed man.

This is again one of those candy eye movie with gorgeous, cute actors. The story is old. It shows how difficult is to come out because of the  reactions by friends, peers, and family members. Even though Achim and Tobi mend things somewhat at the end, the process is rather painful one, and most of the time the gay kid is left out in the cold, alone. This is portrayed rather well at the end of this movie (the music softens the blow.) It is a nice picture.",1200441600,3,2541,4.4
2604477,4,B000GBEWIO,This was a cute coming out movie.  I enjoyed how Germany and others in Europe except the gay community.  I wish America was more like Europe.,1192838400,3,141,4.384615384615385

2604479,5,B000GBEWIO,I enjoyed this movie immensely for its uniqueness. The characters were not flat and shallow but each had their own struggles.

2604481,4,B000GBEWIO,"German or American, gay or straight, the sexually charged adolescence is usually a confusing time. This is a story about first love and coming of age. Set near a tranquil lakeside, several high school rowing teams get ready for an upcoming competition. The coxswain Tobi grapples with his growing feelings for his best friend, Achim, while juggling his part as a ""straight"" teenager with a girlfriend, Anke. Tobi's fear of rejection, tender feelings that are so characteristic of a first love and his futile masquerade as a straight teen through a series of not so honorable manipulations, all culminate before the imminent summer storm...

The acting, storyline and character development are above average. The movie really shines in its cinematic presentation. It's beautifully shot in a bucolic setting. The soundtrack features many songs in English. Except the words ""cool"" and ""queer"" spoken a few times with a strong German accent, the entire movie is in German. You may have to rely on the English subtitles, which I thought were well translated. I think this movie is worth your 98 minutes.",1184716800,4,1098,5.1
2604482,4,B000GBEWIO,"Summer Storm is another coming (out) of age story with a background in sports competition, this time crew racing.  It has all the elements that we have come to expect in this genre, the best friend, the fake girl friend, the first encounter, the betrayal, and then the resolution.  While parts of the story line feel forced, the overall sunny tone of the film, and the compelling characters help move it along nicely.  It would be nice, someday, if the subtitles reflected not only the translation, but also the meaning of the german words.  You lose a great deal of the teen age patoise in the translation.  It sterilizes some of the funnier interactions.",1181779200,5,656,4.719298245614035
2604483,5,B000GBEWIO,"""Summer Storm"" is a very well written German production about the lives of several teens involved in a rowing competition. Tobi, the crew captain of his team, struggles with the deep love he has long felt for his best friend Achim. He fears their friendship will be forever changed as new love blossoms in Achim's life, and can't imagine life without his constant companionship. Achim on the other hand is naive and oblivious to Tobi's feelings for him, although Tobi has tried to show him in many ways. He has vowed that nothing will ever come between their friendship, but will he still feel the same when the truth of Tobi's heart is revealed?

The team is sent to summer training camp, where they are pitted against an all-gay team of rowers. They are all forced to face their desires, jealousy, fears, pride, hidden longings and prejudice as bad weather and tough competition ensues, in and out of the water. Tobi's feelings are intensified as Achim and his girlfriend Sandra fall deeply in love and move on to the kind of physical relationship Tobi has so longed for with Achim. As he sees the openly gay team members express their desires without difficulty, the storm inside of him begins to rage.

The lead actors, Robert Stadlober (Tobi), and Kostja Ullmann (Achim) give flawless performances in their roles. Ullmanns character goes from humor, sweetness and sensativity, to anger, hurt and hatred without so much as flinching. Stadlober's performance is shining as he runs the gamet of emotion that is typical for a teen faced with the various storms of tender youth and self discovery. The casting of this film, in my opinion, was superb, without exception.

The real star of this story for me, was the character of ""Leo"", played by an unnamed actor. A quiet, self assured member of the ""queerstrokes"", Leo quickly relates to Tobi's secret struggle and is instantly drawn to him to offer support, tender affection and unconditional love. While he secretly falls in love with Tobi, he gently pushes him to self acceptance, to help him come to terms with his love for Achim and the reality he must face. The young actor who played this part, was without doubt, one of the best I've seen. He ""becomes"" the character he portrays, and acts with such smoothness and realism. His eyes and expression of tender emotion make it appear that he and his character are ""one"".

Each viewers personal feelings are well represented by at least one particular character. As you find the one you most relate to, you are sure to fall in love with at least one of them. If you like films like ""Beautiful Thing"", you are gonna love ""Summer Storm"". Sound and video quality are excellent, the storm sequences are realistic and all filmed on location in a beautiful setting to make this production top notch all the way.

The downside to this film is without doubt, the subtitles. Any film with subtitles makes it more difficult to follow, especially when the dialogue moves along quickly. It IS however a German film, with a german speaking cast, therefore the language is of course the same. So if you speak english, you will get nothing from the film WITHOUT the subtitles. It is however a film worth putting up with subtitles to view. If english speaking filmmakers would produce more films of this quality, we would not have to look to foreign films for what ""Summer Storm"" offers it's viewers, with the english translation.

As stated on the DVD cover, with a quote from Jan Stuart of Newsday, ""They don't come any sweeter or more appealing than this"". I give this film a definate two thumbs (and a couple big toes) UP!",1178841600,8,3613,4.736089030206677
2604484,5,B000GBEWIO,"The storm, in Summer Storm, takes place when Tobi falls for his best friend and crewmate Achim. The storm only grows larger when Achim in love with his girlfriend, Sandra, and Tobi's resentment for her grows, adding tension to his friendship with Achim. Meanwhile, Anke a beautiful female crewmember is after Tobi and throw in a gay crew team and you have the making of a comic, yet moving tale of friendship and acceptance. The writing swiftly builds the pace of the film and the complicated relationships bring frustration in each character and force the clashes that occur (hence the title Summer Storm).

Robert Stadlober does a wonderful job of carefully directing this film and keeping the actors true to form. The acting is terrific in this film, especially from such a young cast, but all the actors work well with each and become one fluid picture of acceptance and denial, frustration and forgiveness. The topic of this movie, acceptance of being gay in sports, is one that many movie-makers are really starting to explore and the prejudices that occur in the locker room hasn't changed much and seems resistant to change. The winds of Summer Storm bring in a light but refreshing look at young athletes trying to discover who they are, yet finding acceptance within their athletic circle. A great movie and one I would recommend whole-heartedly.",1177804800,4,1356,4.921397379912664
2604485,5,B000GBEWIO,"Coming of age movies are a dime a dozen; but well told, well scripted, well directed, and well acted coming of age movies are rare. This falls into the latter group. The rare one. This was excellent.

Truly, I expected stereotypes galore. The cover of the DVD itself screams, ""I'm A Gay Movie"". In the opening credits, Tobi (Robert Stadlober) and Achim (Kostja Ullmann) were jumping and twisting in the air for no apparent reason, and the camera centered mostly on their crotches, showing their t-shirts as they rose above the elastic of their shorts to reveal well toned stomach muscles and hints of underwear. I thought, perhaps that's why they're jumping - to titillate. But I judged too hastily.

The film reveals its true purpose immediately: to tell a story. And we get the impression that all the skin we've seen, are seeing, and are about to see is not gratuitous, but rather that it represents the hormonal surges that the young men themselves were feeling.

We witness is Tobi and Achim in the locker rooms (boat house?) wrestling and goofing around - boys will be boys. It's noted that Tobi is aroused, and they masturbate together. Achim speaks lustily of girls, but Tobi's eyes speak only of Achim. This might be confusing to some American audiences, who would immediately assume that Achim is gay because he's doing this with another guy. Well, one of the worst kept secrets between teenage guys is that this sort of thing is not uncommon, even when both - or, indeed, all - members are straight. I say worst kept secret because straight guys never grow up and tell their wives, but gay guys grow up and tell *everybody*.

Achim has a girlfriend, who he obviously adores. Tobi, as well, has some interest in Anke, and the filmmakers leave no question about his attraction when we first meet her. Tobi is struck nearly dumb at the sight of her in a shirt that displays her, um, ""figure"" off quite well. Tobi has difficulty keeping his eyes above her chest. Confused he might be, but let's give Tobi this: he has great taste. Achim and Anke are both beautiful.

They are all on the same rowing team, and they are preparing to go to summer camp, where they will compete for the Cup. Tobi is excited about spending time with Achim, and your heart breaks because you can see that Achim is excited about spending time with Sandra (I think that was her name...). Stadlober plays Tobi with so much understated emotion; I never once saw him act. He was the emotional center of the film - he had to be - and he succeeded brilliantly. Achim as well was strikingly believable. Ullmann needed to show more than just affection, he needed to show love for Tobi, and yet it needed to be friendly love. He did it. Without his spot-on portrayal, the film would have been weaker.

When they arrive at camp, another team, Queerstroke, a gay rowing team, is there and Tobi's emotions, once reserved only for Achim, which, perhaps, made it OK for him to rationalize, are brought to the surface. Queerstroke has its stereotypes: a macho ""straight wrangler"", and a feminine guy that dices up veggies well, but they laugh at and question these, which gives us a rare look at gay men (boys, really) intelligently discussing the stereotypes in front of them, some of which are of their own making. At first there is tension when the guys from Tobi's team realize that Queer means Gay, but they all fall into a comfortable familiarity, with a few exceptions that are fun to watch play out.

But that comfort can't last long. Not when Queerstroke's ""straight wrangler"" is making the moves on one of Tobi's teammates, Schorsi, who abhors the thought, and Tobi's feelings, bolstered perhaps by the confident acceptance that Queerstroke displays for their sexuality, are bubbling to the surface.

The discord between the two, perhaps, serves as a metaphor for the struggle that is going on within Tobi himself. It comes to head during a storm - a summer storm. On that night, the two teams come to blows, and Tobi makes powerful realizations. While he sits under a tree, sobbing as the rain pounds his back, Achim is at the same time making love to Sandra. The camera takes us back and forth between the two scenes, and their juxtaposition is poetic.

Everything has to go right in a coming of age movie to make it work, if only because there are so many coming of age movies out there. Here we're lucky to see everything running on all cylinders. It's a gorgeous film, and even those who rented it only to see good-looking young men running about without their shirts will be surprised when they find themselves deeply moved.",1176940800,39,4608,4.658056580565805

2604488,5,B000GBEWIO,"In 1960 I was able to initiate a foreign film festival for the small Midwestern college I was attending. Our committee selected a Swedish film named ""Summer Love"" along with some Bergman and Fellini films. We had no idea that it included full frontal nudity or that it depicted boys and girls frolicking together sans clothing. It was a refreshing and innocent look at adolescent love. It caused a minor scandal in that small town and it guaranteed that all of the rest of the films were shown to SRO audiences. This German film (even though it does not have full frontal nudity) accomplishes the same thing regarding the innocence of a gay adolescent crush and the results of one character coming out. The young actors are well directed and the cinematography is also very well done. The story line is a contrived but it does contain some decent humor and very touching scenes.",1173312000,3,878,4.707792207792208
2604489,5,B000GBEWIO,"The movie ""Summer Storm"" reminded me of what it is like to grow to your teens and come to the realization that you are indeed different from everyone around you including your very best friend that you are secretly in love with.  This well directed and flawlessly acted film shows (in a splendid and in an often amusing way) what kind of hell life can be at the tense time of being a teenager.  I really enjoyed this German (with, of course subtitles) made film.  This film has a bunch of great characters that are acted marvelously by all of the actors.  I now must mention some of my favorites

Robert Stadlober, as Tobi is splendid.  He plays so well the character that is  ""trying so hard to hide how he really feels"" about his best friend.  Kostja Ullmann as Tobi's cute best friend Achim is also great expressing so very well the shock and confusion of ""what has happened to Tobi? Why is he acting soooo strange by trying to kiss me?""  Alicja Bachleda-Curus as Anke plays the very frustrated supposed girl friend of Tobi wonderfully.  I also loved the actor that played the super butch, sexually aggressive team member of the ""gay rowing team"" A very sweet performance is also given by the actor that plays the character that helps Tobi to find himself and to admit what he is.  In fact I loved all of the actors in this movie even the dense, oblivious, homophobic appearing ""win at all costs"" coach.

I agree with a previous reviewer that this film is as wonderful of a ""Coming Out"" film as was ""Beautiful thing"".",1172448000,2,1520,4.487272727272727

I was impressed with all the actors, but Alicia Bachleda-Curus, and Marlon Kittel certainly stand out in this movie for me.  Both, in my opinion, are fine actors who need to be recognized more internationally. (ok I'm talking about the America market here.)

Now the music.  The music by Nada Surf and Vast was used so affectively.  There is a beautiful scene were the hauting music of Vast is played while the camara scans the aftermath of the storm.  Also listen to the last song during the credits by a group called Rosenstolz. Unfortunately there is no soundtract for this movie so I had to go out and buy each cd separately.

Not living in Germany, I can't say how accurate the cultural items were, but they were beievable, and the way the actors sensitively portrayed the individuals was very well done.  The lead and his best friend, Achim, and the girlfriend were portrayed well.  And, for those of us who've been there, the scene on the boat dock was lovely (the entire scene, not just two boys).

The gay team is refreshingly composed of a variety of characters, and the gay boy on the straight team sort of has to decide where his allegiances lie (as his straight crush moves ever farther away from his grasp.)

This film positively cracks with hormones, and it has just enough humor and compassion to carry it off and make it all work.  As with ""Guys and Balls,"" the German flair for film-making and culture add something relevant and interesting that makes this film worth a first (and second) look.

2604507,4,B000GBEWIO,"Teenage hormones are at peak level in this nice little German film 'Sommersturm' or 'Summer Storm' and the result is a set of mini-crises that tumble young people all the time: first sexual attraction, the ambiguity of close friendships, the trials and lessons of first sexual encounters, and the manner in which teenagers survive their sexual decisions amongst their peers.

Director Marco Kreuzpaintner and writer (with Thomas Bahmann) set this attractive coming of age film on the playing field of crewing, a sport that demands full attention and intense cooperation from every team mate.  Two teams from Bavaria, one of boys and the other of girls, take off for a summer camp training session where they encounter another crew from Berlin, a crew that just happens to be composed of gay young boys.  The Bavarian boys' crew team is lead by two long-term friends - Tobi (Robert Stadlober) and Achim (Kostja Ullmann) - and while their friendship is strong, Tobi is discovering that his feelings for Achim go far deeper.  The two share stories about their girlfriends - Anke (and beautiful Alicja Bachleda-Curus) and  Sandra (Miriam Morgenstern) who head the girl's crew team.  At the summer camp Tobi's feelings for Achim deepen and the influence of the team of very handsome young gay boys on the opposing team only serve to heighten the tension.  Tobi eventually has an encounter with a particularly tender and understanding Leo (Marlon Kittel) and as the questions begin to arise a violent storm makes the entire group flee for cover.  The manner in which Tobi comes out to his team and to Achim is the very tender d&eacute;nouement of the story.  The storm raging in Tobi (as well as in other members of the team) settles into the aftermath.

Some viewers may find this film too explicit for general viewing but for this viewer the encounters all around remain tasteful and touching.  The director seems to be telling us that the 'first experience', whether that is gay or straight, is or can be traumatic as well as fulfilling.  The cast does well: there are many very beautiful young boys and girls who play their roles with a natural simplicity and allure.  For a young director (only 29 years old and this is his fifth film) Kreutzpainter seems to have a solid future.  Grady Harp, September 06",1158624000,7,2304,4.859335038363171
2604508,5,B000GBEWIO,"(.....just listen to the breathing........)

Cute......caring......and collected (at one with himself), the ""out"" and self-accepting 'Leo' (a wondrous Marlon Kittel) so knows who he is and so knows where 'Tobi' (an amazingly expressive Robert Stadlober) is coming from.  Tobi is so......lucky to have Leo for his ""first-time.""  And speaking of that time in most all our lives, this film gives us a ""my-first-time"" gay love scene which tops all others in the lengths to which it goes......at least in a movie with such youthful characters.  It's tender and caring at the same time it's feverish and arousing.  Just listen to the breathing......if you think there can be any intensity and turn-on missing from what Kittel and Stadlober bring to us in their dock-side love making scene, you'd have to be deaf, as well as blind.  Again, just listen to the breathing......to the sounds of ""catching breaths and sighs"" (or TURN UP your system, will ya!).  Would you say these guys were caught up in what they were doing, or not?

 While the film's main relationship, between Tobi and Achim, has probably been a life-long one of fun and childhood loving/caring for one another, we watch as things begin to go terribly wrong when ""another kind of love"" starts rearing up, as part of this pair's growing up.  We come to see that a straight Achim is too free and easy (with his feelings) to be just a friend to someone who's now discovering he is gay and in love. Achim, of course, is not be blamed for being who he's been all along; it's just that so much of who he is becomes misinterpreted by Tobi.

I like this movie for its credible acting so much I'd award it an easy 6-Stars.

PS--If anything at all disappointed in this work, it was the director's failure to give us, at film's end, a ""boarding-the-bus-home"" scene in which Leo and Tobi could say their goodbyes.  It's inconceivable to me that Leo, so deeply affectionate of Tobi, would fail to take the time to do so.  Obviously, we can expect little to come of their relationship, since a seemingly younger Tobi has a goodly amount of growing up and finding himself yet to do. However, I think of T. as being very aware of what he owes to Leo's help in making him much more comfortable with who he is.  He just wouldn't have departed without a thank-you to Leo....something that would have been important for us to see.

PPS--Director Marco Kreuzpaintner sure gets the ""teen angst"" thing right, pulling an awful lot of it out of his young cast.  But, then, at 25 or so when shooting, he's only about 5 years older than they.  Looking at his bio-pics elsewhere on-line, it's easy to see how he, himself, could have handily assumed one of these attractive young player's roles.

2604509,5,B000GBEWIO,"This is by far one of these best gay-themed films I have seen since ""Beautiful Thing"" (released in 1996) - and one of the best films (of any kind) that I have watched since ""Crash"".

You will laugh out loud, and cry as you feel the agony Tobi endures while coming to terms with his sexuality.  Tobi (played flawlessly by Robert Stadlober) is the leader of his rowing team, and looked up to by his teammates for leadership.  When his team is up against another rowing team comprised of an all-gay team, his inner feelings are realized.  Tobi deals with his feelings and love for his best friend Achim, and eventually deals with the complications of coming out to him.  All the while dealing with confused emotions for his girlfriend and a new boy he meets on the opposing team.

The film is genuine, well-directed, well-acted and goes head-on with the painful emotions most younger people must face when trying to understand their sexuality.  THIS STORY IS REAL!  And proves once again that we truly cannot help who we fall in love with.  Love is about following your heart - it's about people, not the sex of the individual's involved.

The movie hails from Germany, and is in German with English subtitles.  Even with having to read the film to understand it, the talent of the young actors shines through.
