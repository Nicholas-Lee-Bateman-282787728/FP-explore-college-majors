4669962,4,B005EXA8R8,"The programs included in this two DVD set are as delightful now as they were 40 years ago.  These are childhood memories with a real magic to them, an integral part of my family's Christmas Tradition.  The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat is humorous, primarily for the antics of our favorite feline filosopher.  Halloween is Grinch Night gives the Who's of Whoville yet another opportunity to encounter and eventually outmaneuver their mischievous Halloween nemesis.  And, of course, How the Grinch Stole Christmas is the highlight of the set.

The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and Halloween is Grinch Night are on DVD number 1.  How the Grinch Stole Christmas is on the second DVD.  This second DVD played just fine on my Blu-Ray player, but neither of my Blu-Ray machines could read the first DVD.  Fortunately, I have a region-free player, which handled DVD 1 just fine.  My guess (and that's all it is, a guess) is that the first DVD uses an older coding process which works on standard DVD players but cannot be read by Blu-Ray units.  Obviously, I only have one of these DVDs, and I don't know if this is a recurrent problem.  Nonetheless, when ordering this set be prepared to need a basic DVD player to view the first DVD.

The programs are outstanding; both visual and acoustic clarity are excellent.  I would have rated the product 5-stars if not for the problem with viewing the first DVD.  Nonetheless, 4 stars is still a strong rating, and this product is well worth its price.  It should be a treasured addition to most holiday DVD libraries.  I heartily recommend it.",1352937600,2,1591,4.669064748201439
4669963,5,B005EXA8R8,"Dr. Seuss's Holidays on the Loose DVD has three of my favorite holiday Dr. Seuss programs. Of course, what holiday Dr. Seuss DVD would be complete without How the Grinch Stole Christmas? I can't believe that there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this but just in case, this is based on Dr. Seuss's book How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It's the story of the Grinch who tries to steal a town's holiday spirit by stealing their holiday treats. He doesn't understand that Christmas is not about what you have/get and he learns that Christmas means a lot more than that. This is perfect to share with kids who are just a bit too materialistic on Christmas.

Also included is The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat which may not be as well known to some people. This is originally from 1982 when it won an Emmy Award! The Grinch decides to wreak havoc on the world but the Cat in the Hat stops him by using caring and compassion. Great moral lesson on dealing with adversity.

The last Dr. Suess program included is Halloween is Grinch night which is all about the Grinch trying to declare Halloween *Grinch Night*. The Whos are caught in a horrible storm and the Grinch decides to terrorize everyone in the town. A young boy has enough courage to stand up to him and stop him from destroying the town. Another great opportunity to discuss character with your child.

This has definitely become one of my favorite holiday movies. It's entertaining but teaches a valuable lesson at the same time.",1322265600,8,1494,4.567164179104478
4669964,5,B005EXA8R8,"This product is great and definitely a good buy. It will bring back all childhood memories, especially the classic ""Halloween is Grinch Night"" movie. Definitely something worth having in the DVD collection.",1322179200,3,206,5.46875
4669975,5,B005EXA8R8,I bought this mainly just for the original How the Grinch Stole Christmas movie - this one was $1 cheaper and I got the extra 2 movies...funny how that works sometimes.  Kids have watched the other movies once or twice but for under ten bucks it was well worth it for just the one movie since they could watch the Grinch everyday.,1420156800,,330,4.32258064516129
4669976,5,B005EXA8R8,"My 4 year old loved the Halloween Is Grinch Night DVD which I had seen many years ago and couldn't find anywhere.  The Grinch Grinches the Cat  in the Hat was a pleasant surprise, too.  He is really looking forward to How The Grinch Stole Christmas DVD...he started talking about it as soon as he watched the Halloween Grinch!  Thanks for making these great shows available!",1416096000,,374,4.621212121212121
4669977,1,B005EXA8R8,"This DVD is not woth the money. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is great. The other two movies are horrible. They are nothing but noise and colors that are meant to keep small children occupied.",1413676800,,195,4.6
4669978,4,B005EXA8R8,"I watch the Grinch that Stole Christmas every year and did not know this DVD existed. Now I have the Grinch for Christmas, Halloween and anytime. Something is lost with the new voices for the Grinch and the Cat in the Hat but not much.",1389744000,,235,4.2444444444444445

4669980,3,B005EXA8R8,Boris Karloff is the voice of the Grinch as far as I am concerned. I so remember the grinch who stole Christmas as a little tyke and I guess hearing someone else voice the grinch is hard to take but otherwise any Doctor Suess is great. This is the only reason for my three star selection,1370044800,2,287,4.142857142857143
