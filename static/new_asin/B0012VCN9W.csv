8247935,5,B0012VCN9W,love it,1428019200,,7,3.0
8247936,2,B0012VCN9W,I have a pretty eclectic taste in films and am very prepared to make allowances -  but I can see why this collection of 50 movies was so cheap.  One or two worth watching; mostly not.  This collection isn't box office Gold.,1361059200,,223,4.261904761904762
8247937,1,B0012VCN9W,Item arrived as promised and in condition agreed - but the movies were poor quality and some of the movies were simply terrible.  Well known stars before they were known or movies that never made it at the box office.  Some were not even worth the time to watch.  Do NOT recommend this product!,1278720000,,294,4.407407407407407
8247938,1,B0012VCN9W,"This collection is a good example of terrible film reproduction. Picture quality is fuzzy. Sound is distorted. Read my previous review for details. Amazon should provide information on the DVD reproduction quality. Usually re-mastered means it's excellent. For old movies, not re-mastered means the DVD is unwatchable and a waste of your money. This collection is in that category.",1271894400,,381,5.47457627118644
8247939,4,B0012VCN9W,"The product is of good quality, actually quality you would expect from the older movies.  My only disappointment was I ordered more than one movie pack, i.e., Box Office Gold, Suspense Classics and Best of TV Detectives.  There were many, many duplicates. If I had only ordered one movie pack this probably would not have been a proble.",1251158400,,336,4.775862068965517
8247940,5,B0012VCN9W,"Theatrical and TV movies lifted from VHS cassettes: 26 from 1970s, 21 from 80s, 1 from 60s, 2 from 50s. Each disk is in a protective envelope bearing titles, leading actors, time, rating, and 5-6-line synopsis, all thanks to Mill Creek's research staff. The cassettes were acquired by Mill Creek scouts at Beverly Hills garage sales since 2001. Here's the first 7 pics Your Reviewer watched. (If you have children under 30 in the home, note RED FLAGS!)

(1) ""Drivers Seat."" A poor man's Antonioni torta with Liz Taylor wearing an incredibly clashing blouse, skirt, and coat thruout. In some Italian city, she encounters men with one thing on their mind. But the mystification is, What's on her mind? The pic escalates to la forza del destino in an ominous nighttime park. RED FLAG! see-thru bra, attempted rape in taxi by handsome lothario in zippered jumpsuit, Andy Warhol, Nora Washbourne.

(2) ""A Hazard of Hearts."" A pulpy costume drama by Barbara Cartland. Christopher Plummer loses everything at the dice table, including selling daughter Helena Bonham Carter for matrimony. Diana Riggs is the villainess, James Fox the villain. He is photographed unkindly and looks 4 feet tall. Old white-haired Stewart Granger has a cameo and is surprisingly sweet. RED FLAG! attempted rape in enclosed carriage at full gallop, sword cane, obvious dentures.

(3) ""Steagle."" A coined name combining Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles--football being an enthusiasm of Professor Richard Benjamin. The sudden super threat of the Cuban missile crisis crazies him up and he flys off to some major U.S. cities, fantasizing himself into various roles. His adventure in LA ends on a movie set with attacking hordes of every enemy in the book. Benjamin's acting thruout is comic-superb. RED FLAG! semi-mutual sex in front seat of car, close dancing, sex with WWII victory girl, bermuda shorts with kneesocks, Chill Wills.

(4) ""Act of Love."" After Mickey Rourke breaks his neck, brother Ron Howard is faced with the dilemma of euthanasia. Actor Ron is riveting on the witness stand. Actor Mickey, with a very youthful face and voice, reaches to his very depths with just a few lines in the ICU. RED FLAG! sawed-off shotgun, hard-hearted prosecutor, sleep-deprivation defense.

(5) ""Christabel."" English girl Elizabth Hurley marries German lawyer Stephen Dillane, and they are swept up in Hitler's rise and WWII. He is imprisoned as a suspect in the bomb plot to kill Hitler. She goes to the prison camp and tries to brazen her way to achieve his release. RED FLAG! three hangings by piano wire on meat hooks, two obnoxious Nazi little girls, print dresses with puffed sleeves.

(6) ""Twisted Obsession."" A.K.A. ""Mad Monkey."" Jeff Goldblum, a screen writer in Paris, is brought into a movie project instigated by a young Englishman who has like one bean to put into the pot, but his cool little sister is quite a tool. (Yes, raw sex will steam up your home screen.) Jeff has lots of female problems, including Miranda Richardson on wheels. A nasty picture! RED FLAG! shaved whatchamacallit, oral youknowwhat, peeping-tommy little boy, formaldehyde vat.

(7) ""Twisted Nerve."" This is the reason Your Reviewer had to have this box. The pic is co-scripted by Leo Marks of ""Peeping Tom"" notoriety. Pic opens with a disclaimer negating any link between Down syndrome and criminality. Hywel Bennett is shown playing ball with his Down brother, but Hywel's brain is twisted by a different chromosomal flaw. He can be childish or murderish. Hayley Mills and her mother Billie Whitelaw attempt to handle him. As kind as Hayley is, she's not up for rape by a genetic curiosity. Lots of sexy verbal zingers, but only one scissors stabbing and one hatcheted hairdo. RED FLAG! Hywel's beefy rump, attempted rape at swimming hole, a copy of Pathologia Sexualis, solitary confinement in nuthouse.

8247941,3,B0012VCN9W,"When you see the title box office gold, you expect at least a few decent movies.  Unfortunately they are not found here.  I own several of these Mill creek sets and this is one of the main ones I have been highly disappointed in.  Of course what do you expect when all the titles are available elsewhere in thin cases for a dollar each.

If you really like some of these titles, your best bet is to wait and see if Mills creek includes these movies in on of their famous 250 packs.  I own 3 of these and found the price and content worth it unlike the price of this set.",1236470400,3,570,4.053571428571429
8247942,4,B0012VCN9W,"I was a little hesitant to order this title because my experience with Mill Creek color transfers of movies from the 70's and 80's has been spotty. What a pleasant surprise. I quickly scanned the movies and I was on disk 8 before I found anything that wasn't good or great quality, and even so, the movies are still watchable. Don't know about the quality of the actual movies, but if you've been burned by bad transfers before, you won't be disappointed by this set. One more thing--unlike the other Mill Creek sets that have 12 double-sided dvds, this has 13 disks with the movies on 1 side.",1208304000,16,593,4.5
8247943,4,B0012VCN9W,"BOX OFFICE GOLD 50 Movie Pack offers over 80 hours worth of lesser known films featuring several dozen renowned actors-- some in starring roles, others in support and a few in early career bit parts. A good portion of this box set are now-forgotten TV films. Many titles are European-made but feature American or British stars.

Among the many curios here are:
Elizabeth Taylor and Andy Warhol in ""The Driver's Seat.""
Lee Marvin co-starring in a ""kiddie"" film (""The Missouri Traveler"").
The cartoon voice of Fred Flintstone (Alan Reed) appears as a professor in ""The Seniors."" Includes a young Dennis Quaid.
Minta Durfee (Fatty Arbuckle's ex-wife and silent comedy co-star) has one last cameo in ""The Steagle.""
Several Nashville stars in support of Tom Selleck as ""The Concrete Cowboy.""
A very young Tommy Lee Jones in the Canadian-made ""Emily's Horoscope.""
Check below for who appears in ""Mooch Goes to Hollywood."" 'Nuff said!

Although no sign of film restoration is apparent, transfer quality of MCE's public domain movies is uniformly good. Their dual-side recorded discs usually contain two titles per side and are housed in gloss-coated heavy paper sleeves. Easy access storage boxes are sturdy and remarkably compact.
