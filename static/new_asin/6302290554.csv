7823766,5,6302290554,"This is a European B-movie, but reams betters than an American B-movie. I'm not being Anti-American here; we just don't have that intellectual European panache. The basic plot is of a suicidal paranoramal researcher, suffuring from a fatal paralytic disease. From his wheel chair he holds seances. His doctor, who has a charming pointy beard, is attempting an experimental cure. By giving the patient a dose of the poison 'curare', quickly followed by an antidote, he hope to enable his patient to walk again. The other residents of the storm-shaken old mansion are the paranormal researcher's young and beautiful, yet domineering wife, (Barbara Steele) and a devoted housekeeper. The attractive doctor and his patient's wife have long, confidential, intimate, private discussions. The paitent dies.

Before the couple can enjoy their newfound freedom bizarre things begin to happen. The dead husbands wheelchair comes plummeting down the stairs, toward the guilty couple. We don't really mind their suffering as they choose to shoot the dead man's dog for howling in the long dark nights. Dead husband's voice calls to them from the upper floors. The will has some strange clauses... It's just all really good.

And, I can say, now, that this movie is basically a semi-rip-off of the famous French novel ""Therese Raquin"" by Emile Zola. I figured that out like halfway through. Although in ""Therese Raquin"" the wife murders her husband because he forces her to witness his tediously long evening of dominoes with his dull friends, (you sit passively watching twenty or thirty games of dominoes and see if you don't become homicidal). Instead, the movie adds some lovely graveside scenes, will readings, peristently visiting vicars, and other subplots and many amazing twists, plus a different ending.

The second half of the movie goes a bit downhill from it's original Poe-ish hightone. Maybe there are a few too many skulls lying around. But it's just a darn good movie.

Quote: ""Don't move darling, or I'll cut you."" as she shaves her husband...

P.S. I don't understand cinemotography and all that, but there are some great shots. Very dramatic.

P.P.S. I said this was a European movie, but maybe it's English. Are British people European? Perhaps the question is in dispute. Maybe it was Italian...

I can't believe this movie is such a good price.  Less than a rental, and better quality.",1159833600,,2395,5.091836734693878
7823767,4,6302290554,"British scream queen Barbara Steele, perhaps the most talented, beautiful, and prolific leading lady of European horror, stars in this lavishly Gothic story of murder, greed, and deceit.  Steele plays Margaret, a young woman unhappily married to an older, crippled scientist/metaphysician.  This film from 1963 is in fact a sequel of sorts to the previous year's The Terror of Dr. Hichcock, but ignorance of the first film is in no way an impediment to one's enjoyment of The Ghost.  Such a boring, nondescript title does this film an injustice of sorts because it is a riveting thriller blessed with enough atmosphere and suspense to keep the viewer enthralled up until the very end.  Peter Baldwin plays Dr. Charles Livingstone, the doctor treating Dr. Hichcock for his paralytic condition; the treatment is a strange one, but it is Hichcock's own proscribed cure for what ails him.  Basically, the doctor shoots the patient full of poison and then gives him the antidote in short order; this unorthodox treatment supposedly has quite an invigorating effect on the patient's system.  Naturally, the doctor and Margaret have fallen in love, and Margaret finally convinces her lover to put her husband out of commission for good.  The expected bliss of the murderous young widow and her tarnished lover is not to be, however, as Hichcock's presence in the house grows stronger than ever.  All of the money and jewels are hidden away from the ""grieving"" widow, the town begins to talk about the young doctor remaining at the home of his deceased patient, and the local clergyman periodically shows up to voice his displeasure at the circumstances.  Most importantly, Hichcock""s ghost makes several terrifying appearances to both of his murderers in the house.  While the secret of the haunting and eventual course of events are rather easy to see coming, the story remains vibrant and suspenseful, and the ultimate conclusion is quite satisfying to this viewer.

There is just something special about European horror films, especially Italian classics such as this somewhat neglected thriller directed by Riccardo Freda.  American horror films can rarely equal their transatlantic cousins in terms of atmosphere.  The Gothic look of the huge castle-like manor, the lighting of each scene, the subtle, almost-perfect camera movement, the convincing performances by the players, and most especially the music work together beautifully to keep the pulse of suspense beating strongly and increasingly faster as the film progresses.  Not only does Freda know how to accent the presentation with wonderful music, he also knows when to cut the background music off completely for just the right effect.  I rarely notice the musical background in movies, but it stands out as a palpable force in The Ghost.  This film is so wonderfully made and effectively presented that the somewhat predictable conclusion takes very little away from the viewer's satisfaction.",1050451200,2,2953,5.22457627118644
