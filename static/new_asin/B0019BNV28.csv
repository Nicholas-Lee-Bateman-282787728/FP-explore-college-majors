8273326,2,B0019BNV28,"I guess this workout will produce results, but two issues really bothered me. First, while the instructor is very positive, her rhythm is completely awful and her cueing pretty bad. Was the music playing when they were recording this? I'm pretty experienced at working out with videos and found that you'd need to watch it a couple times before you try doing it. Secondly, I gave the (rather too light) resistance band a try and I think if you are short-limbed like I am, you will find yourself putting your feet further apart than is safe just to keep it on and get any sort of resistance for the exercises. It doesn't fit. I'm putting a knot in it to shorten it up.",1229731200,,667,4.430894308943089
