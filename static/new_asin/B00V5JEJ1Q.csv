7076749,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Finally! I have already pre-ordered The Complete Series. The Complete First Season and Not Just The Best Of The Larry Sanders Show are already in my collection, and I have enjoyed those sets over and over and over again. The First Season has an enteraining interview with Garry Shandling, and Not Just The Best includes amazing, personal, informative, funny and long visits between Shandling and his friends Carol Burnett, Tom Petty, Jerry Seinfeld, Alec Baldwin, John Stewart, Sharon Stone and others. The first two collections are thus definitely worth having. The forthcoming Complete Series will give us all a chance to enjoy the episodes we haven't seen in decades. I can't wait to see Hank confess to Larry's ex wife, after spending a night in a hotel room together, that he emptied the mini-bar and that he will reimburse her. Such situations, sublime and tears-down-your-face-funny, were the result of patient character development and a deep understanding of the human condition. Garry Shandling created the most intelligent comedy series ever. Every writer, every director and every actor responded to his concept and made The Larry Sanders Show a timeless masterpeice. Whatever the reasons were for delaying this release, I am grateful they no longer exist.",1275782400,64,1268,5.220588235294118
7076750,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"At long last, the complete Larry Sanders series shall be mine!  I've been waiting many many years for this one.  It is by far the greatest bar none comedy series ever created on pay or commercial television.  A must own.",1275350400,27,220,4.45
7076751,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Been waiting for this release since... FOREVER.

Once again, Garry Shandling has created one of the all-time greatest TV shows in... well... the history of television!!!

7076752,1,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Love Glarry, HATE THIS TRANSFER. so poor it is almost unwatchable. Get hbo go, and see the way it did look. This has me longing for vhs... ugh.

7076753,4,B00V5JEJ1Q,"They put a bunch of episodes on each disc.  The picture quality isn't high-def quality by any means, but it was fine for what I wanted, which was the complete show for a cheap price.  It is a great show and it was good to see the season 3 and 4 episodes I either missed or only saw once a long time ago.

I should mention that when I bought this, Larry Sanders was not available through HBO Go or HBO Now.  I believe that it is now available, so that might be a better quality version than this.  I subscribe to HBO Now so I don't think I would buy the discs today.  But if you don't subscribe and remember this great show, or want to watch it for the first time it's a good purchase.

7076755,1,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Upon first opening, the abhorrent quality of the packaging is the first sign that this set is going to be a DVD disaster. But you keep your hopes up. Then the opening credits of the first episode roll, and your heart sinks - they look so awful . . .you dubiously think and desperately hope its just going to be an issue with the letter titling.  When the first actual image appears you are crestfallen and angry, though by that point not necessarily surprised: Your first fears have ultimately been proven correct - this set is indeed a total DVD disaster. And what an absolute shame, because the show really holds up and is great entertainment. I guess for $20, what can you expect, and once you swallow your bile and accept with Zen-like tolerance the hideous image quality . . .this set is better than nothing. But just barely.",1522800000,,830,4.533333333333333
7076756,3,B00V5JEJ1Q,"So as everyone says, the packaging sucks. Like oh my god it sucks. I'm gonna throw it all out and put them in my DVD binder with all the other badly packaged DVDs I've bought. Also there are no extras. But I mean, $20 so figures. As for the quality, it's not good. But it's not that bad. It's like the quality it streams on HBO Go last time I tried it. Which sucks, for sure, but it's no worse than that. If you're looking for a pristine piece for your DVD collection with well designed packaging, remastered quality, and extras, this is not it. But if you want something you've seen a thousand times to throw on in the background while you stare at the internet, this works great.",1522281600,,681,4.246153846153846

7076758,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"This was and is a classic show. There is a slight dip in quality in the third season but it rebounds wonderfully. As a time capsule it captures it's era perfectly: late night wars, political humor, rising stars of the time. But it's also timeless as a relationship and workplace comedy. Garry Shandling was a genius and he surrounded himself with experts. Whether you're reliving it or experiencing it for the first time, you'll have a great time.",1521331200,,447,4.743589743589744

7076769,1,B00V5JEJ1Q,"The Larry Sanders Show is amazing groundbreaking television.  This DVD set is garbage and does a disservice to the memory of the show and Garry Shandling.

The packaging is cheap and rudimentary.  Absolutely no extras.  But worst of all is the fuzzy DVD picture quality.  I thought other reviewers were exaggerating but boy was I mistaken.  Mill Creek (the DVD production company) should be ashamed of themselves.  It's not even consistent.  Occasionally it looks okay so your hopes get up, but then it looks like Vaseline has been smeared all over the screen again.

Stay really far away from this version of the show.  Maybe HBO will step in and give fans a really good version of one of televisions landmark shows.",1511136000,23,717,4.80327868852459

But as far as content, there is a ton of value in this. Surprised that the entirety of the series is in one set at this price. love it.
I would like to give this five stars and the content is probably six stars, but seeing everyone slightly scrunched took that fifth star away. Totally worth the purchase price.",1503964800,,567,4.308411214953271

7076798,1,B00V5JEJ1Q,"The Complete Series edition of Larry Sanders is pretty awful. The show, of course, is a masterpiece - far ahead of its time, beautifully written, hilarious. But this edition is horrible. They've stuffed 13 episodes on the first disc alone, and in order to make them fit, they have to compress the video heavily. I mean, it looks TERRIBLE. Heavily pIxelated, choppy motion.

In addition they throw the entire collection into a flimsy, cheap cardboard crackerjack box with nothing more than thin cardboard sleeves to hold the discs.

They've cut every corner they could, and it shows. I would gladly pay two or three times as much for an edition that doesn't suck.",1478304000,4,662,4.849557522123894
7076799,2,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Instead, get the box set with the black cover - The Larry Sanders Show - The Complete Series.
17 discs, whole bunch of bonus features including booklet/guide detailing each episode. There is a separate disc for bonus features alone. Some discs have commentary during specific episodes from Shandling and some of the writers, directors and producers.
Done see it offered here on Amazon at the moment, but that's the one you want.
I believe this version came out in 2007.
They only drawback is that some of the bonus features aren't that great, like a phone conversation with Jon Stewart and a visit with Tom Petty. There is a three way conversation with Shandling, Torn and Tambor that should have been so much better, but is kind of dull.
But the behind the scenes documentary/making of, is worth it alone.",1478044800,5,806,4.764285714285714

7076817,1,B00V5JEJ1Q,First of all I love The Larry Sanders Show. It definitely gets 5 stars however the production of this set by Mill Creek Entertainment is so dismal that it is unwatchable on a large screen. And I'm using a $1200 OPPO DVD player. The amount of compression that was used to cram the entire series on 8 disks creates a picture so fuzzy and filled with artifacts that after 2 minutes I had to shut it down.

7076827,3,B00V5JEJ1Q,"I'm not actually rating the show, since I haven't picked it up, yet. So, to be fair to all of you - and Mill Creek - I'll revise this after I do pick it up. The reason I got on here now was to possibly help in two areas. The first, the paper covers, etc. Few years ago, I picked up the seasons of ""The GIlmore GIrls"" for the wife. They were not paper slipcovers, but the cases were very cheap and brittle and the plastic holders started breaking apart! So, I replaced all those by purchasing this on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/10-Clear-Disc-DVD-Cases/dp/B002ROCIFW?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00. I would highly recommend these. They're great! I just slipped the old cover paper into each one and ... done! Secondly, I wanted to add here that I caught the show when Netflix had it in a very short window. It didn't look ""great"", but I figured it was likely due to how it was taped at the time. Since this, I've seen it on Crackle.com (not available anymore, either) and it looked just the same. There are also numerous complaints that are similar on the topic when it comes to the previous ""Complete"" set. So, I basically believe this is just the state of the show due to the manner it was filmed at the time. Sure, it could be cleaned up a bit, but I doubt it will ever look amazing. That said, the complete series, easily one of THE cult shows of TV, is being sold at $20! That's $20! Hello! So, if the show is pretty much as good as it can ever be and the slipcovers can be replaced for a trifle ... and the ""Complete"" set was around $100 before and all that's different is you may have to replace the cover ... big deal.

7076836,3,B00V5JEJ1Q,"The ONLY reason I'm giving this 3 stars is due to Garry Shandling's ability to crack me up. It's a shame for someone of his tremendous talent and showmanship to have his work be put in such a cheap package. I am so disappointed. The discs are in a thin cardboard paper sleeve where they can easily be scratched. Guess I'll have to buy some jewel cases for their protection. Not only that, but the outside box is shorter than the inside sleeves, allowing the individual discs to extend out of the bottom.

I don't think the person that designed this packaging had any previous experience. A first year art student could've done a better job!

I would think if he were alive today he would be shocked at how inferior this presentation is for his body of work.  Enough about the packaging. Let's talk about content.

I've read some reviews where buyers were talking about picture quality being ""grainy"".  It isn't the best picture quality but it's not HD that we've become used to. It's not ""grainy"". It'll pass for what television quality was like when this show was on HBO. The sound quality is a little off, but again it's what it was like then. I have a sound bar on a
4-year old HDTV and it's okay. We're not watching concert footage.

I'm not seeing any ""bonus material"".  I'm reading all these reviews about all this ""great extra bonus material"" and it's not in this collection.  I have, ""The Best Of..."" and it has some great interviews and individual discussions on scenes but NOT on this collection. I'm also scratching my head at the way it begins.

Just seems like Season 1 Episode 1, begins in the middle of the season. I would think his first show would reference that this is ""My first show..."", but there's no beginning point to the series.  All in all, I'm glad I bought it.

Garry Shandling was such an important part of what the sitcom is today. As cliche as it sounds, he was ahead of his time. ""It's Garry Shandling's Show"" is another classic compilation I have in my library and it's worth buying if you don't already own it. Enjoy!",1461888000,17,2051,4.486559139784946

7076884,1,B00V5JEJ1Q,"(see headline, and end of review for the reason this gets one star... otherwise it'a adequate)

Well, a few of the previous reviews on the new/2015 (Mill Creek set) pretty much cover the rather cheap looking case and poor video quality. (bear in mind the source material - this is never going to be close to HD reference quality, lol)

That said, as the owner of the previous, 27 disc, Shout edition, (unfortunately lost the box, book and several discs to water damage and mold) my interest is primarily on the differences between the two sets.

As previously mentioned, there are none of the bonus features that were contained on the Shout set, the discs are in paper sleeves as opposed to thin cases with hubs, and doesn't contain the booklet.  For the price difference none of those should be a significant concern.  (and aren't to me)

Video quality does indeed suffer from cramming 2-3x as many episodes on each disc compared to the Shout set.  That said, while definition and clarity are noticeably degraded, it is not a huge difference.  Otherwise it frankly appears to be the same transfer.

Based on the above, for <24 bucks I was pretty much convinced this would be an adequate replacement for my damaged Shout set.  (as much as I love Larry Sanders I'm not paying 100 bucks to replace what I paid that much or more for several years ago)

Here's the problem.  (as reviewer Nom De Plum pointed out, but with more detail here) there is an inexcusable problem on disc 4.  (Season Three, Disc 1)  And there may be similar problems on other discs, I just focused on S1E01 on S3Disc1.

S3E04 ""The Gift Episode"" is actually S3E05 ""People's Choice"".  S3E05 ""People's Choice"" is actually S1E07 ""Hank's Contract"".  Things get back to normal at S3E07 ""Hank's Night in the Sun"".  (misspelled ""Hawk's"" on the DVD episode menu)

One missing episode, one repeated episode (two seasons later) is unacceptable.  (again, there may well be more)

For that reason and that reason alone I give this set 1 star and urge everyone to be aware of this!  (if you're ok with this, and the possibility of more similar issues, and aren't terribly interested in the Shout extras and superior packaging, then by all means if you can get this for around 20 bucks go for it!)

update 1 - Ok, seems Mill Creek is aware of this issue (well, there are a few posts on their Facebook about missing/mislabeled episode/s - quite vague and unclear which episode/s and or disc/s are being referred to, at least from the posts I saw going back about a month)

I've emailed them for details and a replacement of (at least Disc 4) and will advise if I hear back from them in a timely manner.  Otherwise, returning the set.

update 2 - reply from Mill Creek.  Says IF there are replacement disc/s they will send them.. returning the set until corrections are confirmed...  ""Thank you for contacting Mill Creek Entertainment regarding your issues with The Larry Sanders Show complete series DVD. We wish to apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced as a result of these issues. Your e-mail has been forwarded to the appropriate parties for further review.

This show, like Garry Shandling's comedy series, is for a definite audience.  For them, it's excellent and 5 stars.  For people outside that group, it's about a 1 star.
Here, we're talking about show business, whether you're attached to it, interested in it(a wannabe?), or just someone who always wondered about it.  For those people, this is a 5 star show and a must-have.  For others, it's a complete snooze and not worth it.  The show is brilliantly cast, with a typical shill that sits out there with him(and preps the audience), a producer that's semi-reliable on alternate Tuesdays, and a secretary that keeps the host[Shandling] in one piece, somehow.

When I lived in the south, I saw a LS Show and found it a total waste.  THEN, I moved to LA area with a friend in show biz and suddenly, I couldn't get enough of the show.  It is a view, if not a perfect view, of show business, with all the in-fighting, scrambling for a buck, and struggling to make the next payment on your bank note, alimony, or Mercedes S500.
The Larry Sanders show is a talk show format where we see the guests being plugged in and out like transistors, with no regard for anything but whether they'll show up, get a laugh, and not screw up.  Apparently, that's not as easy as we think sitting at home.  After all, a 90 minute daily talk show had seven and a half hours, with ads, to fill and that must've been immensely tough in the old days[i.e. Johnny Carson, etc.]  Now with hour-long shows, it's a tiny bit easier.",1419120000,,1620,4.454237288135594

Not in the same way as Curb or the Office does, but more because of the 'serious' tone in the way that Gary Shandling and the cast delivery 'jokes' nonchalantly. I like it, but I don't love it as much as I thought I would. It is an excellent show.

This is a ground-breaking show with some fantastic performances from Shandling, Tambour and the amazing Rip Torn. The rest of the regular cast is solid and with great writing and some hilarious celebrity cameos you can't go wrong.

There are lots of extras - deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and visits with some of the celebrity guests like Jerry Seinfeld and Carol Burnett.

Probably the only complaint is the poor video quality. The show was shot on both video and film. The 'show' parts of the program are on video and are quite reasonable quality on this DVD. The behind the scenes part of the program are shot on film and are quite grainy.

Personally the video quality doesn't bother me too much because it is an oldish show and it is the writing and acting that matters most. You should still get it.",1339977600,3,918,4.585365853658536
7076929,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Gary Shandling was a standup comedian who became Johnny Carson's regular guest host and was heir to the Tonight Show.  However, the backroom machinations and the shallowness eventually got to him and he left.  The Larry Sanders Show is his way of exposing what he hated about Hollywood.

The show is a brilliant mockumentary, in the vein of This is Spinal Tap.  You have to pay close attention, because even the small details, such as ""live from tape"" or the sign with ""Larry Sanders - Host"", are all part of the parody.  Some of the episodes, particular early ones, are somewhat uneven, but even the mediocre episodes are still quite funny.  The viewer gets the sense that much of what is portrayed is not very far from the truth, but it is done in a way that makes you laugh.

The ensemble cast is brilliant.  In fact, much of the humor is provided not by Larry, but by his surrounding cast, such as his producer Artie (played by Rip Torn) and his Ed McMahon-like sidekick Hank (played by Jeffrey Tambor).  Artie is a ruthless producer who knows how to keep everyone happy while keeping the show running.  Artie has the best lines, by far.  Tambor's portrayal of Kingsley as someone who constantly lives in the shadow of Larry Sanders is also excellent.

This boxed set includes a booklet and bonus material, including deleted scenes, on the DVDs.  My main gripe is about the ridiculously bad video quality.  I have rented and viewed many HBO shows and movies on DVD and have never seen such horrible video quality until this boxed set.  Heck, I bet VHS recordings of the show probably look better than the quality of the DVDs in this set.  The show deserves a much better transfer.  However, because there are no special effects, CGI, etc., the poor video quality is tolerable because of the great job done by the actors and writers of the show.

I didn't have HBO at the time, but this was THE show that everyone who was in the know talked about.  Garry Shandling's Larry Sander's Show was so subversive, but so mature and sophisticated.  This show was the template for everything not only HBO did, but just about every network as well.  With its wry take peeking behind the curtain of show business, it was just delightful.  From Jeremy Piven making his pre-Entourage appearance as one of Shandling's comedy writers to Shandling's portrayal of the insecure, neurotic star of a late-night talk show, to Rip Torn's no-nonsense producer who will do anything as long as the show will go on, to the great, egotistical but totally clueless Hank Kingsley (Hey now!).  It is a cornucopia of truly great comedic talent.  You are doing yourself an injustice if you don't check this show out if you love sophisticated, adult comedy.

That being said, there's a major issue with this release - and it's not the totally overblown video quality issue that most negative comments refer to (Seriously, folks - it's an ensemble drama that's nearly 20 years old - not a special-effects laden ""thrill ride"" movie.  If it bothers you so much, watch it on your computer, or the TV in your bedroom, or a portable DVD player - it's not ""65-inch screen with 1080p resolution""-type material!  Would you rather pay hundreds for this many DVDs, just so you can see how many strands of hair remain on top of Hank's head?).

The folks at Shout! Factory should have done a better job researching the show before releasing this set; HBO made some poor episode-sequencing decisions when airing it, and they've been replicated here.

I don't want to issue ""spoilers"", so I'll be generic; while the show is episodic, there are ""story arcs"" taking place, and I was very confused when something serious happened with a relationship between two characters in season 1; it was seemingly ""out of the blue"" - and then apparently forgotten next episode!  Their relationship got more confusing as the season continued.

I decided to look up show info online, where I discovered the problem - episodes are not in the sequence that the producers (apparently) intended them to air in.  This problem appears to continue throughout the series, based on the ""production #"" info I found on ""epguides.com"".

I've just started season 2, and I'm going to watch the remainder in production order - even if it means swapping out DVDs.

If you're just getting started, do yourself a favor and do the same; events will proceed a lot more sensibly - at least in season 1.",1310601600,2,1904,4.636904761904762

7076944,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"In 1992, Garry Shandling forged a brand new TV format: the show-behind-the-show. ""The Larry Sanders Show"" became an instant hit - especially with the A-listers. Following the DNA of The Larry Sanders Show, you find such respected descendants as: Beggars and Choosers, Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and 30 Rock (which incidentally, with 17 nominations, was the first to break the Sanders show's record of 16 Emmy noms.)

The reason any of this matters is because I just watched the entire series, every single show, in one long marathon. The box set arrived on Friday and I watched each episode in order over a four-day marathon. Last night was the final episode and what a killer. I'd forgotten how good this series was - and how Shandling walked away from it while it was still at the top. Yes, Seinfeld owes a great deal to Garry Shandling.

After seeing all of the episodes again, what really grabs me (aside from the great writing) is the list of MEGA stars who were willing to play the worst possible cartoon version of themselves. It's amazing that they would do that, but I think it speaks volumes about the trust they had in Garry Shandling. Another reason to buy this package is for all the talented guest stars who have left us far too soon. Phil Hartman. John Ritter. Gene Siskel. Chris Farley. Bruno Kirby. Warren Zevon.

The Larry Sanders Show box set is filled with terrific extras such as new interviews, fly on the wall conversations, audio commentaries and revealing self-analysis Post-it notes from Garry Shandling himself.

My guess is (based on the fact that they initially offered only a couple of seasons, best of,... we bought those, then they finally come out with complete set) that they will be offering a higher quality blu-ray version in the next couple of years so those of us who couldn't wait will be forced to fork over another $100 to finally get a decent quality complete series.

Many of the episodes that were collected for the ""Best of"" set a few years ago look a tiny bit different here:  on my widescreen TV those episodes have a tiny bit of what looks a VHS tracking glitch at the top of the frame.  That glitch is on several episodes but ONLY episodes that were in the ""Best of"" set.  Curious.

And one can see a slight change in picture quality between those ""Best of"" episodes and the others, most noticeable on the title card.  It isn't enough to get one's underwear in a twist, but it is noticeable nonetheless.

Does all that diminish the enjoyment of the series set?  Heck no.

For a great many years, my all-time favorite movie or TV character was sales manager Herb Tarlek from ""WKRP in Cincinnati"".  He was a lovable loser.  Jeffrey Tambor's ""Hank Kingsley"" character from ""The Larry Sanders Show"" is poised to bump Tarlek down to second place  (Robert De Niro's ""Rupert Pupkin"" from ""The King of Comedy"" sits at third place and Daffy Duck at fourth.)

The writing on ""The Larry Sanders Show"" is as sharp as it gets.  The line between reality and parody/satire can get very blurry sometimes.  They also take the occasional dig at Leno now and again, and that was back when he was still brand new at his ""Tonight Show"" gig and he wasn't very good at it.  The jokes are still relevant though because not much has changed since then.

One of the staff writers (and occasional actors) on the show was John Riggi.  Riggi was a club comic for many years before getting the ""Sanders"" gig.  I saw him perform several times at a club in Memphis back in the 1980's.  I can even still remember some of his routine.  One was about caulk.

Buy this DVD set.  As mindless as TV has largely become in the past several years, it is important to have something of quality in one's video library to remind you of how good TV can sometimes be when the right elements mix together.

If you have this set and the complete set of HBO's ""The Wire"" in your home library, then you can stake a legitimate claim to having the best library on your block.

7076957,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"SHOW REVIEW

When LARRY SANDERS was first shown in the UK in the 90s, I have to admit that I didn't ""get it"". I knew the show was critically praised and had won numerous awards, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else seemed to. Cut to 10 years later and an older me picked up the first season on DVD, in another attempt at giving this praised show a whirl.

WHAT A REVELATION!

I discovered that not only had the show's subtleties had been lost on my younger self, but also, unlike something like Friends, this isn't a show that you can jump into the middle of an episode... You need to see it from the beginning in order to fully appreciate it. Throwaway lines and simple glances become hilarious when you're following the entire story, and so understand the what the character is thinking.

On top that, I realised something else: This show isn't a angry satire of the entertainment industry. I mean, it IS a satire in some ways, but that's not the primary aim of the show. I also used to think that the main jokes of the show were supposed to come from the appearance of ""real life"" celebrities lampooning their public persona. And that those moments were just sandwiched between a satirical portrayal of how narcissistic and neurotic celebrities could be (as shown by the character of Larry Sanders himself). But I was totally wrong:

The real focus of the show is its three central characters.

It's about them, their flaws, and how funny those flaws are. The fact that it's set on a talk show is just a secondary consideration; It's really nothing more than a wonderfully unique setting for a sitcom with lots of opportunities for interesting things to happen (like blurring the lines between fact and fiction). Sometimes, especially in the earlier shows, it's hard to like Larry Sanders. He can be incredibly selfish, but as the show progresses you see a different side of him: The fact that this is just a guy who really struggles with personal relationships. And really, don't we all, at some point or another?

The other thing I learned from watching the shows is that it's supposed to be understood that the three protagonists, underneath their bickering and complaints, are really all FRIENDS. Yes, that's right, Larry, Artie and Hank are actually all good friends... They just have a very dysfunctional relationship. Larry has problems with closeness, Hank has problems with neediness, and Artie has problems showing his emotions, but they all like and respect each other underneath -- when they're not busy dealing with their own exaggerated issues.

It seems like an odd thing, but as Garry Shandling points out, Larry Sanders is really about love, ""which would sound like a paradox at first"", he says, ""But if that love didn't exist, the darker attitudes would not play. You would have a one-dimensional, cynical show, which I don't think the show was.""

Never mind its incredibly clever comedy, its believable, rounded characters, its fantastic structure -- all of which would later be seen in the better episodes of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". Once you start liking, and identifying with, Larry Sanders the character, despite (or maybe because of) all his obvious flaws, the show really opens up and becomes something special. And possibly even the greatest show ever made.

If you let it, THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW will tickle your brains and your ribs in equal measure. Give it a shot!

DVD REVIEW

While it's true that the picture quality here is not amazing, it absolutely does not detract from the show. It's supposed to be an old chat show, after all, and you wouldn't expect Johnny Carson to look pristine. Or maybe you would. Either way, I found the picture quality to be sub-par, but also totally acceptable and in no way affecting my enjoyment of the show. (The fact that the sound is very clear and crisp probably helps.)

The extras on this set are a wonderful companion, too. Garry Shandling takes you on a journey as you watch the show. He seems to really try and open himself up in order to explore what made the show so special in the first place, and so that the DVD extras aren't just talking heads spouting bland platitudes.

What am I talking about? Well, it's hard to explain. Yes, there are one on one interviews with the actors from the show, and there are special ""visits"" with actors with whom he considers friends, but they're all part of something larger, so that they start to tell a story. Each one appears next to certain episodes of the show, so you work through them as you work through the show. It's an interesting side-project and I have to say that it really, profoundly, affected me. If you take the journey, and understand the subtext of what Shandling is attempting to do, you'll come to realise that he's a real artist, not just a comedian.

If you don't pick up on that, then there's just the fact that everyone who worked on the show seems to miss it A LOT. They all seem to agree that something special was happening on the show while they were making it, and that they learned a great deal.

There is one icky moment during this side-project though, when Shandling is unexpectedly confronted by his ex, Linda Doucett (Darlene on the show). It's clear that she still has very deep feelings for Larry, and that she just wants to connect with him. Whatever the reason for her unannounced teary appearance, Shandling, as part of his project, wants to capture these ""real"" emotions as much as possible on camera. This openness and ""realism"" forms a large part of what he's attempting to do with the rest of the extras, but unfortunately, in this situation, it just comes across as very cruel. Doucett really doesn't seem comfortable, and almost pleads not to have to talk on camera. It's at this point that Shandling seems to be using the camera as a way to distance himself from her, rather than connect with people.

Whatever the reality of the situation, and whatever Doucett was trying to communicate, the segment doesn't come across well. My interpretation of events may be completely wrong, but I can only hope that they had a private conversation somewhere, and Shandling didn't shut her out once the camera stopped rolling. Either way, it wasn't the most pleasant way to spend a few minutes.

There's a few things given away in the commentaries that don't make it onto the DVD, too: Shandling says that he's going to have a second visit with Doucett during one commentary, but no such visit appears on the set. On another commentary it's mentioned that Scott Thompson discussed having difficulties with his character's episode, but that part of his interview is not seen on the DVD. (Thompson's character was by far the least developed on the show, so it's understandable.)

On the whole, though, I was surprised at just how much love had apparently gone into this set. The little menu jokes from the ""Not Just The Best Of..."" are missing, but on the whole, the extras felt very cohesive and satisfying. (Apart from the ""introduction"" video with Garry, which was neither profound or funny, and just came across as annoying.)

Finally, if you are looking for behind-the-scenes dirt, this isn't the place. There's no mention of the lawsuit between Doucett and the show (she was fired after she and Shandling broke up), or of the lawsuit between Shandling and Brad Grey (Grey allegedly moved all of the writers to other shows he owned, leaving Shandling in the lurch for the sixth season, and ultimately spelling the demise of the show).

Instead it's much more of a celebration of what made the show special, and what made it work. And oddly enough, as much as I'd like to know about the other stuff, the celebration feels totally appropriate, sincere and satisfying by itself.",1295568000,7,7746,4.722962962962963

7076961,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"""The Larry Sanders Show"" is easily the most requested TV show on DVD. Despite having gone off the air in 1998, episodes of the show have been piecemealed out on DVD over the last decade due to ongoing legal disputes. Finally, those issues have been resolved allowing the complete series to be released.

I could spend hours praising ""The Larry Sanders Show,"" but perhaps the best thing I can say, is that even though I haven't seen most of the episodes since they first aired in the 1990s, I still remember almost all of the freeze frame endings -- it made that much of an impression on me. It's been a riot rewatching the whole series. The show consistently had me laughing out loud more than most shows on today. I forgot just how outstanding Rip Torn and Jeffry Tambor were.

For those unfamiliar with the show, if Larry David were to ever make a workplace comedy, this is what it would be. On the surface the show skewers Hollywood vain and vapid culture, but at its core it's a workplace situational comedy. And the showbiz aspect of the show lets it explore situations that most workplace sitcoms never dare to go, such as sex tapes and drug addiction.

I was surprised how little ""The Larry Sanders"" has aged. Between the edgy humor, unsentimental tone, and its innovative visual style, it feels like the episodes could have been made this year. In fact, most of the celebrities featured on it are still active, and comedians are still making jokes about the Clintons, OJ Simpsons and Michael Jackson. In a few episodes even ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" is joked about -- talk about a timely release of those episodes.

I was also impressed with how in the first season it felt like the show had already been on the air for a few years. It didn't take them a year to hit their rhythm -- they hit it immediately. The extra features include Jeffry Tambor's screen test, and the performance he gives in it is pretty much identical to what's in the show. Everyone knew everything about who these characters were before the first episode.

The video quality of the episodes is fair, but a lot of it has to do with the source material. The show was shot on both 16mm film and video -- film for the ""real life"" behind the scenes portions, and video for ""The Larry Sanders Show"" within the show. To create as much of a contrast between the two, and to give the film portions a documentary feel, a very grainy film stock with muted colors was used. The video portions are low resolution -- it looks like video form the 1980s. As a result, the MPEG compression causes the film grain to look like noise with artifacting. None of this detracts from the show -- just be aware that it's meant to look like this. In seasons 5 and 6 they switched to a much less grainy film stock and higher resolution video cameras. As a result, the last two seasons look much better than the rest of the series.

Almost all of the extra features are recycled from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Not-Just-the-Best-of-the-Larry-Sanders-Show/dp/B000MTFDB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Not Just the Best of the Larry Sanders Show</a>&nbsp;box set. I never bought that box because I've always been holding out for the complete series, so all the features are new to me. There are endless interviews with virtually the entire cast and many of the guest stars. While Garry Shandling is surprisingly candid in them, even bringing up his romantic relationship with one of his co-stars, on the whole I found the actors to be pretty fatiguing to listen to.

What was much more interesting were the commentaries and interviews with the shows directors and crew. ""The Larry Sanders"" show was actually a technically complicated to show to shoot. Despite having sets with four walls, instead of using a single camera the show was shot with three cameras simultaneously. And the show had so much physical movement that its DP skated around on rollerblades while holding the camera.

In some of the outtakes you can see how carefully choreographed all the scenes were -- there's footage of the actors and camera crew missing their marks and banging into each other. This is yet another genius aspect of the show. Despite its workplace setting, it features lots of movement, which gives the show energy and keeps things visually interesting. I think a lot of people failed to appreciate the complexity of the continuous shots that would begin on the show set, move down a hall way, into the production office, and then into Larry's office.

The crewmembers also go into depth about how ""The Larry Sanders Show"" show within a show was shot. The show was performed as if it was an actual live talk show with both the film and TV cameras running. Apparently Shandling was very insistent that that the film crews never intrude and break the reality of the talk show.

This box set is an absolute must for fans of ""The Larry Sanders Show."" We've waited over a decade to have it on DVD -- there's no need to hesitate in buying. And if you've never watched it, it's worth discovering this series -- I envying people who will get to experience it for the first time.",1294099200,9,5156,4.725250278086763

I'm in my 30's and didn't really like the show when I was younger. The themes are adult and the general tone is likewise. But after putting on a few years, not to mention pounds...  This show now sparkles.
Mine was a backwards introduction I must admit. I enjoyed Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm more and more as the years went on. Now Curbed is a ritual in our house. Why does this matter you may ask...  They were the result of the brilliance that is The Larry Sanders Show. It was the trailblazer that began the comedy style shown in todays most popular shows (The Office, etc.)
Based on my love of these shows I decided to give this another chance some 20 years after I first had the opportunity and passed.  The show is built for an adult audience. This is mature humor and can be subtle in most instances. But that is what makes it truly brilliant. Instead of standing in a room and screaming out ""look at me"" the comedy is crafted. Rip Torn, Janeane Garofolo, Jeremy Piven, and Jeffrey Tambor highlight the supporting cast in this show devoted to late night talk shows and the stars that inhabit them. The stars range and include a who's who of todays stars. Just on that point alone the set is valuable. It's great to see the character interaction as Larry steps into problem after problem.
In short it is a great building block for the comedies of today. The set is nice and well put together with no packaging issues as you would expect for the price. There has been a price reduction which I think makes it an easier grab. Being someone who did not watch any of it.... It's well worth the price of admission. A solid bet for the comedy fan.

The Larry Sanders Show will likely be regarded as one of the seminal TV series by the next generations of TV historians - why?  Because...

As an HBO product, it was unfettered by the bounds of network television and provided insight into the(fictional)behind the scenes activity of late night network television.  I could always have pictured Fred DeCordova dropping the 'F' bomb on Ed McMahon...

Like Citizen Kane, many of our current 'insider' sitcoms (The Office, 30 Rock, Extras, etc.) can trace their roots back to TLSS.  What's the genre?  Docu-comedy, pseudo-drama, twisted reality television...

As continuity-based series go, we all grew to understand and have a vested interest in the careers of main characters (Larry, Hank and Artie) by seeing both their complexities and their simplicities.  Adding to the big 3, the ensemble cast provided us with a whole array of other characters (fill in your favorites here) that also have unusual depth and substance.

In a fame-starved world, we got to see the stars of the day in a different (sometimes unflattering) light.  I've always been uncomfortable with David Duchovny since TLSS.  Even Californication can't get it out of my psyche.  But, when these stars stepped up to the plate, they made me appreciate them more as human beings.

Oh, yeah - it's a funny show too.  Forgot that. Like Nat Hiken (Sgt. Bilko and Car 54,Where Are You? fame), there's not a lot of Garry Shandling to go around.  So, it's actually about quality, not quantity...

Go find a loving home for all of your previous TLSS discs (you owe it to your friends - and you're not losing any of the features) and place this on your shelf next to your collection of 'It's Garry Shandling's Show'.  Enjoy!!",1289001600,5,2021,5.012012012012012
7076975,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"I love this show like my own hypothetical child, but this set misses the mark for me. I'm not getting a 17 (!!!) discs collection when this could have easily been printed on three or four blu-ray discs. Get with the times, publishers. You just lost a sale from me, and probably others. I still gave the product five stars because TLSS deserves all the attention it can get. Now if they could just release a blu-ray version in the near future and I'll be in heaven.",1288569600,2,464,4.344827586206897

I am guessing the delay was due to contracts with syndication, I don't know. It is unusual for these to hold out for this long but I am happy to see the rest of the series available all at once.

This was an excellent show. The simultaneous live/tape dual cameras was pulled off masterfully by all. This was a very very funny show if you have not seen it. It was perfect parody of the whole Johnny Carson experience.",1285718400,4,555,4.336538461538462
7076977,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"And there will be no (?) question mark after my title, The Larry Sanders Show was simply the greatest TV comedy ever, and ranks with any of the all-time great TV shows.  The three lead actors played against each other perfectly, with a combination of honesty, ego and vulnerability that is rarely seen on TV.  The Hollywood 'behind-the-scenes' that the show revealed felt so real that the viewer just knew he or she was getting reality in a fictional setting.  And the guest stars who allowed themselves to to be poked, prodded and, ultimately, revealed in ways that no other series , before or after Larry Sanders, ever dared to try.

As Roseanne said in one memorable moment ""Surf's up!"".

Hank Kingsley is the best character in comedy history

Garry Shandling is a brilliant actor, and a great complex human being

This is a brilliant show, from episode one to the end, and has a perfect ending! Which is nice as all other shows that ive liked usually have cop out endings

HEY NOW!! Hank Kingsley is a meat and potatoes guy",1281484800,3,448,4.36144578313253
7076983,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"Well, I'm so glad I didn't give into temptation and buy the last compilation, even though the episodes selected were many of my favorites and the Extra Features sounded superb.

Does anyone know if those same extras will be on this complete set?  Better still, even more goodies?

My Season One Set will go to a good home once this is released.

I give this stunningly hilarious series 5 stars just for the episodic quality (Special Features or no).  A Brilliantly Funny Series from beginning to end.

I agree completely with the reviewer singing the praises of Jeff Tambor's Hank. An incredibly complex and multi-layered character. I never knew if I was rooting for him, against him, or just felt pity for a guy who was simply born to be a second banana. A very shallow and superficial man with unexpected depths of loyalty, sentiment, and pathos.

Rip Torn as Artie? Powerful and funny as hell. A Force of Nature. I can't imagine anyone being able to play that part with more gusto.

Shandling as Larry himself? Well, (like Seinfeld) it takes a lot of confidence to let his co-stars steal so much of the limelight. It takes courage to play a character so fundamentally weak and cowardly (yet, strangely charming and REAL). He was the center of a whirlwind of dramatic events which he wasn't even aware of half the time.

The core triumvirate bounced beautifully off each other. The outstanding supporting cast (many gone on to other shows with great success) kept things moving like clockwork.

The Camera work which went from Slick Production to a Documentary Behind-The-Scenes Feel and back again...kept making me wish for an ACTUAL Larry Sanders Show....and kept blurring the line between reality and fiction. Very Meta.

The writing for this series is superb. I have a thing about the episode with Hank's Birthday Tape. Artie's line ""Well, you know the camera adds about ten pounds"" possibly my favorite line from a sitcom ever (I darn near choked to death from laughing).

..until the last line in that very same episode topped it!

And it is SO fun to see celebrities playing themselves as jerks (or at least very human). That takes a lot of guts. (Extras did the same, with fantastic results. I show the Patrick Stewart clip all the time).",1280966400,7,2248,4.762886597938144
7076984,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"The influence of The Larry Sanders Show cannot be overstated. Without this program Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Office might not have existed in the form they do today. It was (I'm pretty sure) the first HBO non-standup comedy series and it pioneered the uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges that Ricky Gervais took to the nth degree in The Office. It also created the device of celebrities playing unpleasant versions of themselves which Gervais used in Extras and Larry David uses in Curb. It's a shame that it took 12 years to finally get all of the episodes released.  The stories are all immaculately written and constructed, weaving the characters personal lives and conflicts with snippets of the fictional talk show. One of the greatest TV comedies ever, ranking right up there with CYE, The Office and Fawlty Towers.

Comparisons with 'Curb' have always baffled me,the Larry Sanders show is so far out on its own as to defy comparison with anything subsequently produced.

the mill creek Larry Sanders Show collection collects the entire series, it crams episodes onto discs in such a way that the quality ends up looking like a youtube video circa 2006. Subtitles just go away after the first few discs, no extras.

8709318,5,B00V5JEJ1Q,"5 stars for Shandling. 5 stars for Amazon customer service. 0 stars for the defective product -- I replaced the set 3 times, for a total of 4 sets of DVDs, and in every single set there's a bunch of discs that are visibly defective and won't play when you put them in the DVD player.

I suspect this is because the discs were manufactured back in 2010, and whatever stock we're buying now in 2018 has been sitting around in warehouses for years. Storage media always degrade over time, though it's surprising that these have degraded so fast. Or perhaps a batch of them were defective from production.

Either way, you've been warned. Amazon is great about replacing/returning/refunding, so you're safe to order them, but you'll likely be returning them. I'm really disappointed because I wanted to own a set, but I just can't keep such an expensive purchase if some of the set doesn't play.

Apparently there was an earlier version on 17+/- disks (versus 9) by another company that was much high quality.  This version is bare bones in every way. . .even the main menu is flat, with NO settings, animation, music or anything else other than a couple buttons to click.

AND are there any subtitles for the episodes ??. . .I can't find them.

Adding to the problem is the fact that in the original production the ""on-air"" and ""off-air"" scenes were shot on different media to give the on-air parts a higher resolution and quality as a intentional feature of the program.  So the off-air parts look particularly bad on a big TV.",1526515200,,792,4.427586206896552
