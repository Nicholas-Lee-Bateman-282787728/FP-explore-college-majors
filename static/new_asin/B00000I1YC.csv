8301145,4,B00000I1YC,"At the beginning Jason is still a prisoner in the Dark Dimension.  Goldar was ready to kill him.  Jason survived by diving beneath the fog.  He could only lay there, helplessly, as Goldar started systematically stabbing the floor.

Next Rita brought Scorpina to Earth.  A warrioress of formidable skill.  When she faced the other 4 Rangers she had the Putties with her.  Giving the audience a nice action sequence.

Eventually Goldar was called away for battle.  Leaving Green Ranger to finish Jason.  They fought, resulting in Jason being on his back and at Green Rangers mercy.  Fortunately the others managed to teleport Jason away at the last second.

At the end of the episode Goldar was Towering above the city, promising a Megazord battle in the following episode.",1453507200,,771,4.9375
