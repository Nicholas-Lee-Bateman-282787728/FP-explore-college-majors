6354820,5,B00JCCHM30,"4 1/2 STARS FOR AN EXCEPTIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT ON A MODEST BUDGET

***MOVIE SHOULD NOT BE COMPARED TOO HARSHLY WITH A BELOVED BOOK THAT HAS TIME TO COVER MORE EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL GROUND THAN A 104 min FILM

Private Peaceful is based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo, who also wrote War Horse.  This emotional journey of two devoted brothers from youth into adulthood and service in WWI is really an amazing accomplishment for the budget it was given.  I have seen many terrific low budget historical movies (this is historical fiction) that did not match this for production values and excellent acting.  The movie should be given allowances for not covering the same emotional and social ground as the novel in the short run time allotted.  That said, it is still reasonably true to the structure and spirit of the book while being good enough to work as entertainment on its own.  Naturally this movie doesn't have the high gloss of the movie adaptation for War Horse, but it does still have a certain feeling of life or soul.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Charlie and Tommo (last name Peaceful) are two brothers in a working class family.  They are devoted to each other, regardless of whatever words or fists they may hurl.  Tommo is the younger and often defended by his older brother when other boys at school pick fights.  They are both fiercely defensive of another brother who has a disability.  This loyalty will be challenged when a young girl named Molly moves into their village.  She becomes fast friends with both of them throughout childhood.  As they become young adults, WWI looms and there is pressure for young men to go to war.  Tommo is still too young, but succumbs to the pressure as he flees a childhood guilt and his current circumstances.  He lies about his age to enlist.  Ultimately both will need to look after each other and face the absurdity and horrors of trench warfare, compounded with other challenges of class and social standing.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The social issues are some of the things the movie has less time to touch on compared to the novel, but they are certainly represented.  The movie is still very emotional, but also cannot be expected to punch quite as hard as the book.  This movie has received tremendous acceptance from the British public and the few people who felt differently hated it specifically because of their love of the book and certain expectations.  That gives you a pretty good idea of how to prepare yourself without actually giving anything away.  A large part of the movie deals with the lives of the boys growing up, so it's not just a war film.  The battle scenes were quite decent, though you shouldn't expect big budget Hollywood level mayhem and gore.  The acting also, for the budget, is really excellent.  If you are a fan of the genre and enjoy the backstory of their growing up, I highly recommend the movie.",1423008000,51,2884,4.704590818363274

I'll try to skip to the points: A) This movie is about brotherly love moreover than historical accuracy during WW1. B) It's not all about WW1 throughout though there are some battle scenes that are short lived. C) It is a bit predictable but over all well worth the watch. D) The acting is actually pretty good though some parts felt dry.

Summed up.. watch it. If you have brothers you'll love or at least enjoy this film. BBC did well. Again, don't expect this to be a Band of Brothers for WW1 type movie, but it's still well done and hit me right in the feels at the end since I have brothers.

6354864,2,B00JCCHM30,"So I have been reading some WWI history lately and I was interested to see this movie on the war. I figured it might feature some interesting insight into the conflict. I have to say I was really disappointed.

*Spoilers below, you've been warned.*

The story centers around two English brothers Charlie (Jack O'Connell) and Tommo(George MacKay) Peaceful (GET IT? They're soldiers in a war and their name is ""PEACEFUL"", That's such biting satire!) The movie starts before the war and centers around the untimely death of their father (Stephen Kennedy) and the arrival of a young girl in the village, Molly Monks(Alexandra Roach) who is the first of MANY twists that you will see coming a mile away. So, the younger Tommo is immediately smitten by Molly who immediately falls for the older Charlie. Charlie of course couldn't care less but is more than happy to knock her up and then, this being rural Britain in the nineteen teens, marry her and move into the same house that his mom and now pissed off younger brother live in. Along with their older brother who is mentally handicapped for some reason. I suppose be cause it makes him a contast to the non-mentally handicapped officers who are not nearly as ""peaceful"" haha, get it, as he is. Oooh, look at that contrast. Just like everything else in this movie there are 0 shades of gray.

So, when the war starts, all the ""lads"" are happy to enlist and do their patriotic duty. Charlie hesitates at first because he has a pregnant wife back at the tiny cramped cottage. But, eventually enlists because he has a pregnant wife back at the tiny cramped cottage. So, his hesitation wasn't really that much of a point except for what happens later to further make him out as the innocent lamb led to the slaughter

So, once the brothers are at the front, Charlie receives what one would call a ""million dollar wound"" and is sent home to convalesce. After a brief, antagonistic home leave where he spends most of his time aggravating Uncle Dursley who plays fat lord Grantham in this thing,  he decides he  should re-enlist, a minor limp being not that much of a hindrance to military service back then, and re-join his brother at the front line.

So, of course, at that point, you know he's dead.

On the next attack after the brothers are re-united, they end up pinned down in a shell hole. Their pointlessly horrible sergeant orders them to move forward. A move that is virtually suicide. Tommo appear to be dazed from an explosion and Charlie simply refuses. So, of course, they are both charged with cowardice But, only one of them gets stood up in front of the firing squad. OOOOH, big twist, they are both Private Peaceful..Which one will it be. But, of course, it's Charlie. The decorated, medically discharged volunteer sacrificial lamb. Otherwise we couldn't all say ""It's terrible, he could have just stayed home but he CHOSE to come back and fight!"" With all the indignation of a sophomore philosophy major complaining how there are no good jobs for Philosophers. YAWN,

While it sucks that this happened and that poor Charlie gets shot for doing exactly what the army tells you what they will shoot you for, During WWI, Nearly every army would literally march tens of thousands of their troops into machine gun and artillery fire for virtually NO REASON. The entire point of the battle of Verdun was to grind the German army down. Keep in mind, in that battle there were nearly 1,000,000 Casualties with nearly 300,000 killed. Several different historians talk about troops not even bothering to load or even take their rifles in some cases as they knew they would be killed before they got anywhere near a chance to use them. So while I will agree that this story sucks, it is soooooooooo small change in the scope of WW1.

Besides which, Stanley Kubrick an Kirk Douglas told this story 1000 times better nearly 60 years ago in ""Paths of Glory"". A better movie, a better story and a better cast.",1486425600,3,3956,4.679136690647482

The movie however wastes over an hour dwelling on the first half of the book and spends the last 20 minutes skimming over the second hald. It is a travesty and should be avoided at all costs. :(,1477612800,,482,4.138297872340425

It was unthinkable that a military officer would act with as much callousness and disregard for his men and get away with it. The ending was meant to be shocking but I found it simply confusing.

The poor children that suffer the overwhelming poverty and yet remain happy children despite it all.  First kisses, skinny dipping and heartbreak of separation caused by war are just some of the emotional experiences that are portrayed and bring back your own memories.  The loving family that loses so much because of war.  Two brothers that end up on the battlefield trying their best to hold on to each other, when they are facing hell itself.

It is adapted from the book written by Michael Morpurgo about the brutal realities of war, especially for the lower classes, the cannon fodder of most wars.  Morpurgo also wrote War Horse. The movie takes place during World War I in the fields of Devon and the battlefields of Flanders. It's about the relationship of two brothers growing up in the shadows of The Great War and their love for the same women. It also gives you a good insight into the feudal life of people living in rural England at this time and how it shapes their consciousness which I found very interesting. The main characters in this film are Charlie and Tommo Peaceful who's fate is sealed when they decide to fight in this war to win all wars. Their love, courage, and devotion to each other is severely tested when one of the brothers is facing a military tribunal.

6355130,1,B00JCCHM30,"This story is done in a way that shows the sadness of war and the time it took place. The story like War Horse left me feeling empty . The older
brother Charlie at first you liked but his character became harsh and not someone that was true to his wife. The younger brother was weak and
never showed his courage. We all know how brutal war is but thank God for those who throughout time have stood up to evil. Oh ye evil keeps
coming but do we all just think we can love evil away. I can only say that this movie was written by someone who is in another unreal place.",1430352000,6,567,3.982456140350877

8649744,5,B00JCCHM30,"The most richly developed war movie set in WW1 yet seen. Private Peaceful deserves to be mentioned with War Horse, Paths of Glory, Gallipoli and All Quiet on the Western Front. In many ways, Private Peaceful surpasses all of the above and offers a fuller depiction of a misty period of time that is still greatly relevant.

Private Peaceful is technically a War Movie, but uses a dramatic storytelling approach which makes it unique in the genre. Its closest comparison could be Gallipoli (1981), or period dramas which fall outside the war genre.

The war genre hasn't produced many notable modern films for WW1 (my opinion, of course) because the subject is hard to describe within the boundaries of the structure. The world has transformed so thoroughly since (perhaps as a consequence of) the Great War that we cannot easily relate to the people that lived it and the settings they inhabited. To tell a story that makes sense, characters require much more screen time to properly establish, sucking up screen time which could otherwise be devoted to action. As a result, your typical WW1 movie either isn't a war movie (technically) or comes off as shallow and unbelievable (""wooden characters"" will do that).

Those primarily interested in gritty and heart pounding depictions of trench warfare may find Private Peaceful too slow, but that is inevitable given the challenges I describe above. This film balances drama in well enough to make the action matter, and offers enough action to provide a realistic experience of fighting on the Western Front.

Dramatizing WW1 for modern audiences is an enormously difficult task, but Private Peaceful nails it.",1513728000,3,1659,5.043795620437956
