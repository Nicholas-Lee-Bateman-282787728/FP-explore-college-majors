1233689,5,B00000JL4N,"I heartily recommend the entire 4-part ""Macross Plus"" series,  but especially so the second episode...it has moments that  positively engrain themselves in peoples' memories.  In fact, some of the  more hypnotic segments from this episode have been used in psychedelic film  loops at underground rave parties for years now!  When watching, it's easy  to see why, particularly during the lush and sensual virtual reality  concert, featuring the ultimate Idol singer...the artificial (and  psychotic) diva, Sharon Apple.  The other sequence that really takes the  cake is the test-piloting sequences of experimental fighters in the desert.  It is, quite simply, brilliantly done.  The ambiance of a high-security  military base is captured entirely, due in no small part to the animators  visiting real United States Air Force bases in their pre-production  research.  The traditional Macross love triangle is back, at once blatant  and yet reserved: the actions may be intense but all of the main characters  are holding something back from each other.  And the military intrigue  subplot continues to lurk beneath the surface, to be fully revealed in  Episode 3.  But in the meantime, you'll have a ball with this one.  For  real.",955411200,,1230,5.31413612565445
1233690,5,B00000JL4N,"If you like the Macross Saga, this one is a must buy. The animation on this movie is one of the finest ones done by the Japanese.  The story line is flowing and continual.  The music is quite awesome.  If you are  interested in anime, this one is one of the few that you should put in your  collection.",938908800,11,302,4.0508474576271185
1233701,5,B00000JL4N,".... I could give it more stars.  This series is nothing short of breathtaking.  Ya know the old saying ""A picture is worth a thousand words""?  Stop reading my review and buy Macross Plus.",1019001600,,188,4.470588235294118
1233702,5,B00000JL4N,"Yes, I also noticed Guld scene being cut down. (I saw that scene in Macross Plus Game edition). But I'm not talking about that.
Volume 2 brings a stunning conclusion to this series. This is where all the gritty battles start and everything wraps up. But if you want another flaw, it's in the two versions of translations on DVD. The Japenese track has a some different (and better) music tracks and sound effects when compared to the english version. This is most noticable in the main battle scene.
But alas, as I have come to realise and expect with most anime, the ending is wrapped up WAY too quickly. But apart from that, it brings a great conclusion to the series.",1010361600,,670,4.5
1233703,3,B00000JL4N,"I bought this series becaues I saw a fan-made music video featuring Gould in his YF-21 fighting the Ghost X9.  This fight scene is one of the best airplane fight scene is not the best in all of anime.  It features Gould exceeding the G-force limiter on his fighter to be able to crash into the Ghost fighter sacraficing himself to bring it down. As a result his eyes popped along with the blood vessels in his body.
When I watched the DVD that I had just bought, that dramatic scence simply featured Gould turning up his thrust and running into the X9.  My first reaction was WTF!?!?!?  Where's the scene that I paid almost $30 to see?  Not only that, but a few other small scenes were missing too.  Well I later found out that this was simply the regular version.  The extra scenes I was looking for is in the Macross Plus OVA version.  It is not out yet but planning to be as of this post.
My suggestion?  Don't buy this even though it does have some amazing fighting nonetheless.  Wait for the soon to be released OVA version.  I know I am! (wish I did my homework before I bought this)",1007683200,3,1089,4.263414634146342
1233704,4,B00000JL4N,"Macross Plus takes place several decades after the original Macross Series (Series 1 of Robotech), after Earth has colonized several planets and are still fighting the occasional Zentradi straggler.  In this DVD, Sharon Apple (the computerized singer) heads to Earth to do a benefit concert near the Macross (SDF-1).  Sharon goes nuts and takes control of the inhabitants via mind control, as well as activating and controlling the SDF-1.  It is quite a site to see.
MEanwhile the main character races to Earth in his Prototype valkyrie in order to destroy a new unmanned fighter Earth has developed (he does not like the idea of pilots being replaced by machines); all the while he is chased by the other prototype valkyrie and pilot.
A great fire fight ensues, which gives us the first taste of real action in this series.  The battle first starts with the two pilots, then their agression is turned towards the evil controlled Macross and Unmanned fighter (which Sharon has also taken control of).
The ending of this series leaves something to be desired.  Although the ""day is saved"", it comes at a price, and we are not given any after affects.  If you have ever watched old Jimmy Stuart movies (like Mr Smith goes to Washington), you will know what I mean.  The climax comes, and is resolved, and the movie is over.  Imagine if the original Star Wars ended immediately after the Death Star was destroyed, without the congratulation ceremony we are all accustomed to seeing.
The movie just kind of leaves you hanging.  Is this a good movie?  Absolutely!  Should you pruchase this?  YEs and No.  If you want to own a good OVA based on the Macross Universe then this is definitely worth it to complete the collection.  If you like Anime with lots of plot and characterations (like Cowboy Beepop), then this is for you.  This DVD is far more action packed than the first one, but the climax was unsatisfying.  If you are a casual viewer who wants a little more action in the MAcross Universe, then I suggest renting MAcross Plus The Movie, which is more of a compilation, and supposedly has a new and more satisfying ending.",1003276800,,2126,4.720867208672087
1233705,5,B00000JL4N,"I bought the first DVD so, i have to buy the second one. What can I say? Just IT's MACROSS PLUS. One of the best animes I ever seen before. The final battle is espectacular. It's combine ordinary animation with pc animation plus an excellent music with the concert of Sharon Apple in the Earth.",995587200,,294,4.363636363636363
1233706,5,B00000JL4N,"When Isamu finally recovers from his injury, things start to go out of control. While Myung heads for Earth for the preformance of Sharron Apples concert on the reawakening of the Macross ship, Isamu and Guld are shocked to hear that the project they are on is cancelled because of the AI controlled Ghost developed. Angry with this, Isamu escapes the base in the YF-19, but Guld goes after him in the YF-20. As Sharron makes her premiere, Myung is held captive by Sharron. After Isamu and Guld have a little friendly fire fighting, they go after the Ghost. Guld makes a supreme sacrafice to kill it and now Isamu must now alone take on Sharron who now has control of the SDF-1. The music plays a key roll during the last episode and gets kind of creepy. Extras include trailer for episode 1 and previews for all the other episodes. Then theres the Manga Video Commerical which is a music video featuring Manga titles, the Manga 2000 commerical which just shows the title of each Manga title, Fan Club Trailer, Palm Pictures Trailer and (I don't know why they included this) an Anti-Drug commerical. The image gallery was ok, but all the pictures have text on them. The menus are pretty well setup featuring a Sharron concert. So overall, a great DVD to an already great series. Kudos to Manga.",993600000,,1294,4.606060606060606
1233707,4,B00000JL4N,"what is otherwise a great conclusion to the series is hurt by the lack of resolution between the three main characters. The conflict between Guld and Isamu ends in an anti climax, with the uneventful death of Guld. Everything else about this film is excellent, it takes you on an emotional ride that is second to none. The awesome animation is coupled perfectly with music by Yoko Kanno and above average acting. This mini series transends it's simple entertainment value and presents a beautiful tale on the effects of self-image. Dissagree? Need recomendations?

1233708,5,B00000JL4N,"This is a must buy especially if you already have the first volume. I think that the whole OAV series should be in every anime fans' collection. The depth of the story is further highlighted in volume 2. As with the first volume (part 1&2), the animation is great, the music is a great compliment, and the dubbing didn't spoil any delight (you can watch it subbed also). What's also great about this besides being in the DVD format (which is far superior than any format out there) is that it also includes lots of extra features such as trailers, production credits, audio options, and lots of anime preview commercials. Macross Plus the OAV version is a whole lot nicer than the movie. As evident in Volume 2- it just gives more detail and depth to the story. Overall Macross Plus is a must buy anime for all anime lovers and its good enough that new anime fans might actually adore this as well. It's really more than your average anime. By the way this is in no way connected to the ROBOTECH story line. Still the mecha action (the mechas itself are awesome enough) lives up to par with the Macross tradition. Don't just watch this on rent or from a friend- have a copy!",982627200,6,1174,4.439814814814815
1233709,5,B00000JL4N,"I have seen almost all Japanese anime movies and this Macross Plus series is absolutely one of the best ever made.  Although the movie has no excessive violence or nudity, it is pretty obvious that it was made for little mature viewers who wants something more than typical action anime.  The characters development was done so much better other typical animes and the final revelation / redemption scene of Guld was so movingly done.  The awesome aerial fighting sequences will take your breath away and the haunting music score will stay in your memory for a very long time.  However I was so disappointed to see that the single most exciting and poignant scene involving Guld was deleted in this US release DVD version.  In the original Japanese VHS version that I saw few years ago, the aerial fighting scene between Guld and the Ghost plane was little longer and much more intensely done.  When Guld finally catches up with the Ghost plane, he actually sees it right in front of him just before both of his eyes caved into his skull due to the extreme G-force.  After few scenes later, it shows his destroyed plane floating in the space as the camera closes in to show his heroic lifeless body.  This scene was so beautifully done and I was so moved by it.  I don't understand why it was deleted in this US release DVD and it's a real shame that other US viewers won't be able to experience it.  If you want to feel the full impact of this movie, go out and rent the original version from one of the Japanese VHS rental shops.  You won't be disappointed.",978480000,19,1559,4.512455516014235
1233710,5,B00000JL4N,"The battle between Guld and Isamu has taken it's toll on Isamu.  Wounded, he escapes from the hospital with Mung.  Then the trouble starts.  The completion of the AI Ghost ship, and Sharon's psychotic breakdown lead  Isamu and Guld face to face for one final showdown.  Get this DVD but only  if you saw the first one.  The music is still a highlight, but there is  less of it in these two episodes.  However, the best song of the serise,  Information High is included in episode four.  The Animation is still top  quality, however it is a shame that the earth concert wasn't longer.  A  mistake that was fixed for the theatrical version of the series.  Enjoy  this treasure of Japanese make.",963360000,,692,4.549180327868853

7912385,5,B00000JL4N,Awesome product. Was very pleased to find this version offered the English Dubbed option as most versions out there are strictly Japanese with English subs (which is offered on this DVD version too if desired). I prefer hearing the English dubbed rather than reading the screen as I find you miss a lot of the action and detail of the wonderful artwork when you are focused on reading the screen.

The story is a bit slow but that's essential for telling the great and powerful story about Isamu, Guld and Myung. The battles are electrifying, fast-paced and magnificent. For a good dose of anime this is your stop.
