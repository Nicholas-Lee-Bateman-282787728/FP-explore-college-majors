1866566,5,B00008XS0X,If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan you'll love these stories. Well acted and directed. A treat for the mind!,1193875200,,105,4.578947368421052
1866567,5,B00008XS0X,"While neither installment on this DVD really showcases Holmes' abilities, they are both very well drawn portraits of the man. Both Holmes and Watson are in good form here, and Brett and Hardwicke are solidly in character.
""The Priory School"" shows us an interesting case of kidnapping, although in my opinion they reveal who the villain is a bit too soon. Excellent use of locations and the fascinating use of a school choir in the soundtrack make this a satisfying episode.
If one has an interest in learning the art of cinematography, you couldn't choose a better place to start than by studying the excellent work on display in ""Wisteria Lodge"". Director Peter Hammond, cinematographer David Odd, and production designer Tim Wilding truly excelled in the spectacular use of shadows, colored lighting, and the subtle placement of mirrors throughout the episode. Mirrors pop up in odd places throughout the Granada series, but never more so than in ""Wisteria Lodge"". The misty, frosty countryside is also nicely photographed here.
The idea that a simple country police inspector can rival Holmes' insight puts a new twist on the case that is unusual in the canon.
For those not yet familiar with the Granada series, you may first want to check out some of the earlier installments in ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"". However, while not famous cases like ""The Red-Headed League,"" both installments on this disc deserve a spot in your collection.",1060992000,3,1449,5.041666666666667

It you love the original Sherlock Holmes stories, you'll love this production.  It's tragic that Jeremy Brett died before Granada could do all the Sherlock Holmes stories.",1493942400,,334,5.166666666666667

These are based on Sir A. Conan Doyles famous short stories and adapted to these movies. You should first read the original stories to appreciate these adaptations. Jeremy Brett plays Sherlock Holmes, Edward Hardwicke plays Dr. John H. Watson. Jeremy Bretts personality is carried over into Sherlock Holmes, a fault.

The Priory School.
A man walks into Holmes room and collapses. Principal Huxtable tells of an abduction of a student. [Holmes is crass here. The boys father is the Duke of Holdernesse, one of the richest men in Britain. What kind of tires were on the bicycle? Holmes and Watson reconnoiter the neighborhood. Tracks from cattle obscured the trail. Holmes finds the body of the German master. Holmes studied those family portraits, then talks to the Duke about his secretary. The Dukes staff searches the lands. They find a cave, an accident happens, the mystery is solved, the son saved. [Doyle tells about a scandal in the aristocracy. Did this story remind you of The Hound of the Baskervilles?]

Wisteria Lodge.
Men watch at a train station, then travel to a country house. Scott Eccles visits Holmes about a visit to a new friend, a foreigner. The next morning all had vanished during the night! No one knows Garcia. The police are there because of the death of Garcia. Someone bludgeoned Garcia to death with a sandbag! Holmes inspects what was left behind. Watson sees a man outside who runs away. Watson walks in the countryside and visits and old house. Was the wrong man arrested for the murder? We learn about Henderson or Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro. Does the English Law affect this man? The Governess tells what happened. Will Justice be served? [Why would a dictator be given asylum in England? Did he serve their Imperial policies?] Was this plot confusing?",1404259200,,1831,4.862179487179487
7987844,5,B00008XS0X,"It's very hard to find Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, and at such a great price. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1394496000,,110,4.285714285714286
7987845,5,B00008XS0X,Do not miss watching this series. Jeremy Brett is fantastic and each episode is well done. Easily watched again and again.,1346630400,,122,4.857142857142857
7987846,5,B00008XS0X,"""Wisteria Lodge"" is certainly an excellent episode, but I cannot praise ""The Priory School"" enough.

Every element, both technical and artistic, is top notch.  The various locations chosen for filming - from the halls of the ancient priory school, to the dining room as the gentlemen took their cigars, to the grim, raven-haunted moors - each of these perfectly establishes exactly the right mood.  Jeremy Brett was at the height of his abilities and gave one of his best performances.  Edward Hardwicke avoids the tendency to make Watson look foolish and plays him as an intelligent and useful partner (just not as intelligent as Holmes!).  And the guest stars, especially Charles Croker-King as the Duke, give equally excellent performances.

Those familiar with the original story written by Conan Doyle will notice some fairly significant changes in the ending, but with all due respect to Sir Arthur, these changes allow the characters to behave in a much more understandable manner.  (I always thought the only reason behind the Duke's bizarre behavior in the written story was to create a surprise plot twist, unfortunately at the expense of realism.)",1270339200,,1158,5.160427807486631
7987847,5,B00008XS0X,This is an excellent DVD of the now classic Sherlock Holmes stories starring Jeremy Brett. The visual and auditory quality is perfect. No defects or disappointments. Very faithful to what was originally shown on PBS television. There have been a number of good portrayals of Sherlock Holmes over the years but Jeremy Brett has surpassed everyone else by far. All these producitons are entirely consistent with how the stories were originally written by the author. The period sets and costumes as well as the speech and mannerisms are entirely faithful the later part of the Victorian Era. A feast for those of us who feel quite at home with imagining Victorian England. These shows will delight both seasoned Holmes afficianados as well as people new to the stories.,1253750400,,767,5.0
