669446,4,6303534422,"Well, I just have one thing to say, and that is the movie is GREAT!!  I watched this in '95, when I was in a mid teens and shall I say, ""I totally loved it!  Totally!!""  Well, I watched again just recently and  I think that it's still a very good movie.  Though there are some details  that I'm sure people can fight about, but all in all, I think it's great  for all ages.  It's family value packed while having some teenage things in  there.  So, great movie.",929577600,,461,4.078651685393258
669447,4,6303534422,"A Goofy Movie is a wonderful children's movie that focuses on a father-son relationship that seems to get lost in the generation gap.  It also sports a lesson to be learned in pretending to be what you are not as well as  lessons on lying and on trust.  Amidst these mainstreams, it is non-stop,  fun filled, Goofy song and dance with just the right amount of humor.  A  great video in the Disney tradition for all ages!",911606400,,420,4.3896103896103895

Life came crashing down when a family member stole it from out of our house and we never saw the movie again. And for a long time it seemed as if no one has ever seen this movie or heard it because it was so hard to find. But my sister recently found it on here and i knew i had to get my own copy. I am so happy to have this movie back in my life. I watched with my son now, i had to give him this a experience for the culture. Lol!

671459,5,6303534422,"This  movie  is  pretty  funny.
Its  about  a  father  &  son.
&  Dad  tries  to  be  both  a  mother  &  a  father  to  his  son  near  the  beginning,  you'll  see  him  vacuuming  &  wearing  an  apron  over  his  head  pretending  to  be  like  a  housewife.
They  have  nothing  in  common  it  seems  like.  &  the  father  only  wants  to  increase  the  bond  between  the  2,  as  if  he  was  one  of  his  sons  friends  from  school.
All  kids  boys  &  girls  want  their  parents  to  understand  them,  &  believe  me  that  doesn't  come  easy.  Junior  prefers  to  be  around  his  friends  more  then  his  father.
&  just  enjoys  being  cool.
So  one  day  after  Junior  misbehaves  in  school  by  pretending  to  be  a  rock n roll  star,  &  getting  in  trouble  with  the  school  principal,  Dad  decides  its  time  to  show  his  son  just  how  much  he  loves  him.  Even  if  he  is  missing  the  point  that  his  son  is  trying  to  get  across  to  him.
So  the  Journey  begins.  &  Junior  goes  anyways  even  though  he  is  against  going.
The  funniest  part  was  them  arguing  over  the  radio.  The  part  about  their  encounter  with  big foot  I  didn't  enjoy  all  that  much,  &  him  riding  on  the  roof  of  their  car.
I  would  have  loved  to  of  gotten  to  see  more  of  Pete  their  neighbor.
You  see  a  lot  of  fancy  stuff  with  his  RV  trailer,  stuff  you'll  only  see  in  a  fantasy  world.
Another  funny  part  was  when  Dad  wasn't  watching  the  road  very  carefully,  &  they  go  off  of  a  cliff  &  land  in  the  river.
&  use  their  car  the  way  they  would  use  a  raft  &  continue  their  Journey  to  Hollywood  to  see  Juniors  admired  singer,
&  Junior  gets  his  wish  after  all.  &  the  girl  he  was  attracted  to  finally  truly  falls  for  him.
The  movie  is  worth  watching  &  very  very  goofy!
&  on  the  TV  show  that  use  to  come  on  the  Disney  channel,  just  ordinary  everyday  cartoons,

675497,5,6303534422,"I rediscovered this movie from my childhood in college. It was the perfect length to watch in between my Tuesday/Thursday classes since it was less than an hour and a half long. I watched it once, laughed and smiled the entire time and after my next class I dragged my girlfriend and another friend to watch it as well. That night I got a call from my friend who had more friends he wanted to show the movie to. This word of mouth chain continued for months and I have probably now watched the movie over a hundred times. Every time the movie is hilarious and causes me to smile constantly throughout.

I am now out of school, married to that girl and we have a daughter. I plan on showing this movie to our daughter and any other children we have for as long as they'll let me.

Why is this movie so good? Aside from the catchy songs and classic Disney Goofy, the themes of teenage social pressure and the gulf between parents and children are timeless. I am convinced that the people who worked on this movie used it as their avenue for some very high brow film concepts too. I have watched this movie with film majors who have watched in awe while rattling off all their film major vocabulary like mise en scene and comments about perspective and camera angles. Little jokes that I never caught during previous viewings that different friends noticed. (The father of one characters in the movie is a bulldog with a crew cut who does nothing but grunt and a friend whose parents were in the military shouts out, ""That dad's a Marine!"")

Can't recommend enough.",1435968000,4,1562,4.454545454545454

Also, my son started telling people ""I have to drive across the country before I end up in the electric chair."" My husband told me he got it from this movie. HaHa. The first dream scene is a little trippy and disturbing for my 3 and 5 year olds, too. Next time we watch it, I'll sit through the whole movie with them.",1432425600,2,485,4.225806451612903

676698,5,6303534422,"In my opinion, this is the best Disney movie I've ever seen. It's a movie that not only kids can enjoy, but also adults can enjoy without have risqu jokes like most of the horrible shows you see on tv today. This movie has plotline after plotline which all tie in together to the story very well and the way Disney portrayed this story is they took a basic idea of a teen in high school, but actually made it interesting and original in a way no one has ever seen it before.

The music in this movie is also fantastic. Majority of the songs are catchy and ""scream"" Disney. I also love the 90's atmosphere of the songs in this movie. It has a very modern feel (modern to the 90's that is) and isn't entirely a kiddy movie that is only for little kids.

There is so much more I could say about this movie, but I can't without spoiling anything. But this is defiantly recommended and I feel is the best (and very underrated) Disney movie",1420156800,,934,4.212290502793296

This movie is about the joys of family and how sometimes, even when they are trying to do the best for us they drive us crazy. I feel like Max is the typical teenage who just wants to get his way even if it hurts others, and who is easy to embarrass. Goofy is just a father trying to make a different to his son, but is going about it all the wrong way and still picturing his grown up little boys a child.

Well it didn't - in fact it was pretty good - not as good as' Little Mermaid' or 'Beauty and the Beast' but over all a good movie. The story was a good one concerning a dad (Goofy) trying to keep a connection with his teenage son. I would rate this a very solid 7.25 to 7.75 out of 10 stars.

We just rented it on the Kindle at first because I didn't know if they would like it, but they LOVED it!! We ended up buying it and they've watched it at LEAST 8 times in the last two weeks!! Its a good mix of funny and serious, music, comedy, peer challenges, and of course GOOFY!!! It covers a broad range of ages because of its content. Its like the newer Disney Channel shows, but without the dramatic, snottyness that is on TV today. My 3 yr old, 5 yr old and 14 yr old LOVE it!! And its nice to see your 14 year old enjoy something innocent sometimes because of the not so innocent things that go on in a 14 year olds day. It lets him slow down from friends and baseball and all the peer stuff and enjoy something simple. We LOVE it!!!",1374364800,,925,4.005405405405406

People my age who had younger siblings like I did all know the characters, the themes, and especially the songs of those venerable Disney animated films from the mid-80s (and before) through the mid-90s.  This one doesn't get it's due, though.  I think it's a little bit lighter and a little bit more ""fun"" than those other ones.  So maybe it doesn't invoke the same emotional response of those ones.  But for me, half of the appreciation of Disney movies was the music.  This one has a couple of songs by a sort of Michael Jackson-cum-boy band [review author winces at word choice] character ""Powerline"" (Tevin Campbell) that I can still sing word-for-word to this day.",1373587200,,697,4.672131147540983

678496,5,6303534422,"This is by far one of the best movies Disney has made, though people overlook it because it was one of few original concepts they produced in the 90's, or because it's not an action or fantasy movie.

This movie shows real emotion between a father and son who are going through the rebellious/growing up stage where the child isn't a little boy anymore. And both sides have to come to terms with what they're trying to hold on to. But in the end they realize that you can be your own person and still be your parent's child at the same time. This film is enjoyable for children and adults alike. I still watch it from time to time, because its message still rings true.

I went through that as a kid and now that I'm an adult, I can look back on this movie and how it made me feel about that, and how I understand both sides now ;)

And as always, Goofy is hilarious and this movie has its share of amazingly funny moments.

As for this particular film being on a VHS tape, I still consider VHS to be a valid format. I have the complete Walt Disney Feature Animation collection on VHS, save for Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, The Rescuers and The Black Cauldron. In either case they're easier to find and much, much cheaper than renewing my whole collection on DVD (or Blu-Ray, which I don't really care for as I actually take care of my DVDs, or have a player)!",1354924800,,1426,4.289962825278811

I realize that they wanted to show his disappointment with the theme park, but Disney could have got the point across another way.  There was another scene earlier in the movie when Goofy's son is on his way to school, and a girl punches his shoulder because he is acting not so cool.  Also, the very beginning of the movie starts off with a nightmare, from which Goofy's son wakes up to punch the alarm clock.  There is no need for any of this violence.  I had to explain to my son too many times that this behavior is not acceptable in reality and this is only a cartoon.  I wish Amazon would provide a refund.

Max fibs to the crush, telling her he's going to be at the rock concert and that he'll join them onstage at the end. Then it's up to him to figure out how to get to CA instead of Lake Destiny for fishing.

I have watched this movie with my nephew a hundred times and I still laugh at Big Foot dancing to the song Staying Alive. The songs are engaging and even as an adult I find myself enjoying them. The movie itself is witty, funny and teaches kids that honesty is the best policy and it's ok to love your weird family. It's easy to relate with Max, as a love struck teenager, and with Goofy, who just wants his son to be successful and law abiding.

The Delightful Inventiveness, it's Funny how these two disagree argue and made up, it brought back memories from Wonderful Vacations gone by, it also remind it me of the Old Magic Moments Cartoons reminiscing of the 40's and 50's from the Big Disney's Archives, An Entertaining Big Cartoon Trip, that Captures the Warmth and Frienship between Father and Son!",1308873600,,1183,4.601895734597156

It is the moving epoch of a man whose only aim in life is to make his son happy, but he does it without regard to what his son sees as happiness. Goofy cannot see the opposition that his son gives to his plans for them, but what else would you expect from a man whose name is Goofy? In a world that treats fatherhood as an afterthought, this is a refreshing look at a man's unyielding love for his son.

678682,5,6303534422,"My sister and I are in our 20s and haven't watched this movie in awhile, though it was one of our favorites as kids. We watched it again last night, and found that it definitely holds up over time. What really impresses us is for all the outrageous ""goofy"" ;) antics and general silliness, the movie presents a real life situation of a father/son disconnect in a genuine way, without taking sides or pandering to either parents or children. To elaborate, Max is a stereotypical teenager fighting gracelessly and sometimes cruelly for his independence (and displays an incredible lack of foresight throughout), but he isn't ""shown up"" at the end by an omniscient authority figure a la ""Freaky Friday"". Goofy is overbearing and clueless, but his concern is genuine (rather than pasted on for the sake of annoying Max, as you often see in shows aimed at kids/teens) and eventually appreciated, rather than played for laughs throughout. One of the highlights of this dynamic is the fight between Goofy and Max in the river. It's surprisingly visceral for this genre (""I am not your little boy any more, Dad! I've grown up! I have my own life now!"" ""I know that! I just wanted to be part of it."") and actually genuinely saddening. It makes their reconciliation even more touching and satisfying.

I also want to tip my hat to the soundtrack for having *extremely* memorable, clever, and overall impressive songs (I always take note of the short section of ""On the Open Road"" where Goofy and Max sing in counterpoint; it's not much, but you don't see a lot of counterpoint outside of musical theatre, and don't really expect to see it in something like this; it was a nice touch.)

I do get the feeling that the ending is a little rushed, if only because the rest of the storyline was really well-developed. There are some errors in animation (watch when Max and PJ are leaving school on the last day; two students remain frozen behind them) but they're not horribly noticeable or intrusive.

TL;DR I love this movie. It's funny, touching, and well-crafted, and you will be a better person for having watched it.",1307923200,,2106,4.732970027247957
678776,5,6303534422,"My earliest memory of seeing this film was in a room for kids while my parents shopped in what I think was a furniture store. I don't recall if I ever saw the full film, but I certainly saw bits and pieces.

I finally got to watch the full thing recently, after watching the snippets I caught on TV over the years, and I must say this film is just wonderful. I'm eighteen, and while I do have a soft spot for Disney films of course, this movie is special. Let me just say that I normally DON'T like Goofy--shocker, right? I normally find him completely grating on the nerves. But I actually rather like him in this film, and I don't mind the hijinks he gets into in here. Max, though, is certainly the star of the show, and a wonderful star he is. He is very much an real teenager: He doesn't hate his father, but it's true that he can't tolerate him for various reasons; he's shy around his crush, but he is brave enough to make a move--even if not necessarily as ""himself"". He's funny, sweet, and realistic all at once.

Of course, when reviewing A Goofy Movie, one can't neglect mentioning the Powerline music. I'm listening to it right now, actually. I saw a review on one website calling it annoying, which was part of the reason that spurred me on to write this review. I loved the music at four years old, and I love it all the more now. It's clean, but it also has that sort of something that grabs the listener's attention and makes you want to dance and go to his concert. He's no male Hannah Montana. The singer for Powerline has a great range, wonderful singing ability, and is passionate about his music.

While rewatching A Goofy Movie, one of the things that stood out to me is that this is perhaps the most realistic depiction of high school life in any cartoon. Take, for example, the scene ""After Today"". You have the comic book nerds, the preps, the jocks, the people who are too lazy/out of shape to actually do gym, even the goths (one of my favorite lines in the song is, ""No more pep rallies to cut. Blegh!""). You even have somewhat skimpy clothes in this film on a couple characters, although it's good-ol' eighties' style.

I also was very impressed with the characters. Amazingly, in Roxanne and Max's relationship, it's not just Character A = bold, Character B = shy. Both are very intimidated about their first relationship, but are able to muster the guts to actually speak. This makes their relationship worth rooting for, rather it just being the ""Oh, he's going for the aloof popular chick who's a flirt. Great"" storyline that keeps popping up. Then there's Max's friends, with their strange little quirks when they could have easily been bland characters. Goofy and Max's relationship is also a joy to watch because it's not a ""I'm right, you're wrong"" thing. They simply need to learn to see ""eye to eye"" and meet each other halfway. Goofy must relax his hold and accept that the teenage Max is not two-year-old Max, and Max must accept that his father is crazy and a klutz, but is a pretty good guy and willing to do anything him.

Despite my high praise for this film, I considered giving it four stars because it was rather short and Max and Goofy's surface issues could have been fixed straightaway if they had actually bothered talking, particularly if Goofy had explained about a certain phone call. However, it turned out alright, and even though it isn't even an hour and a half long, it flows very well, better than some other Disney films in fact, and allows it to be a highly enjoyable tale. Please, do yourself a favor and get this film. You won't find such depth in many other animated films, Disney or otherwise.",1306713600,,3660,4.4812593703148424

678778,5,6303534422,"The original ""A Goofy Movie"" was a fairly popular movie for young children in the 1990s. It would be a great addition to the collection of any adult who grew up during that time and loves movies that make them nostalgic. For today's youngsters, who are used to cartoons like ""Phineas and Ferb"" and ""Toy Story 3"", I think this movie may not be as interesting, but an okay choice anyway.

While you may have enjoyed this movie as a kid for its entertainment value, you might notice many references to popular culture: Mickey Mouse appearances, tons of other Disney movies, a Michael Jackson parody, and much more! The cross-country road trip is rather enjoyable, the romance between Max and Roxanne is cute, and the movie's soundtrack is pretty good too. Some of the songs are kind of cheesy, but I thought the last song ""Eye to Eye"" and the background music was great.

I think this movie teaches a lot of life lessons as well. A vacation can be a great bonding experience for people with a rocky relationship. Parents need to accept at some point that their children are growing up, and children need to understand that often, parents are looking out for the children's best interests. And, adults should take other people's advice with a grain of salt, because Pete's suggestions to Goofy didn't exactly work out.

All in all, it's a great kids/family movie.",1299369600,,1359,4.701680672268908

The last time I saw it I was about 9 or 10 years old before my VHSes stopped working. When I was little this movie was one of my favorite Disney movies ever. One of my fondest memories of this movie was its soundtrack. Its definately one of the most underrated movie soundtracks. I didn't know it then, but Tevin Cambell (an R&B singer) did the music for, the Goofy universes version of Michael jackson, Powerline. OMG! I have Eye To Eye and Stand Out on my MP3 player now. I even have the clips from the songs in my favorites on Youtube! The animation is definately top notch. It takes me back to the time when Disney, Don Bluth (when they were awesome) and other companies made handdrawn cartoon movies instead of just CGI. At least Princess and The Frog is an attempt at bringing back that magic, but whens the next one coming. Theres alot I can say about this movie, but it'll be pages long.

678783,4,6303534422,"A Goofy Movie is my favorite Disney animated movie of all time. Hands down. It's almost never mentioned by uppity film critics, a lot of Disney fans usually forget it, and it isn't exactly a 'masterpiece' like Snow White with stunning animation, but it definitely holds its own. I watched it back when it came out, and I loved it. Remembering this, I saw it sitting on a shelf at the store and decided to give it another shot to see if it stood the test of time and my being 25 now. It did. If anything, it only got better. Before The Incredibles, there was another Disney film that brought families close together. And that, was A Goofy Movie, believe it or not. Go ahead and laugh, because I wouldn't believe it if someone told me that too. Goofy, bringing families closer together? Insane! But it's not. Goofy is a great character for this kind of movie about a teenager growing distant from his dad. While it's a good one for families, it's even better if you're a single dad with a son. While I'm a few months late in saying this, it's also a very good Father's Day movie if you two can sit back and enjoy ""just"" a cartoon.

We start out with Max, Goofy's son. He's dreaming about a girl he has a crush on, Roxanne. It's ruined before they kiss, when he starts to turn into his dad. Huge teeth, feet, hands, ears, everything. He wakes up, and panics once more- he's overslept and he's almost late for a little surprise at school. His dad busts in and embarrasses him already, showing up with a towel wrapped around his body and one on his head too while Max is getting dressed. Not a good start for the last day of school. Max makes it and gets together with PJ and Bobby (a new character voiced by Pauly Shore. He acts just like him too). They throw together a huge stage performance where Max imitates Powerline, a pop star in the Goof world, and everyone in the school goes nuts. It comes to a halt when the principal interrupts, and the three friends get into big trouble. Unfortunately, he calls each of their parents at a bad time- Pete (PJ's dad) is giving Goofy a speech about how Max could join a gang or get into even worse trouble if Goofy doesn't start being a little harder on him. Goofy takes the call from the principal as a little wake up call, and makes plans to go on a trip to a fishing spot he and his dad went on ages ago. Well, Max had impressed Roxanne with that onstage risk, and they were going to go to an after-grad party together. The trip gets in the way, and he lies to her, saying he's going to see Powerline live since he knows him. Goofy and Max hit the road to what Goofy thinks is a fun fishing trip and time to bond with his son, but it's anything but. The two argue, stop talking to eachother for a period of time, get into huge danger in the woods and in a river, and more. I'm sure every parent with a teenager can relate to most of what goes on here.

Now, even just barely out of my teenage years, this movie really hits me. How Max treats his dad from time to time made me resent him, but also made me realize that we've all done something like that. Leaving in the middle of what's supposed to be a fun place because you think it's dumb...you can see the pain on Goofy's face when Max does this. And what makes it hurt the viewer is that it's Goofy- a character who's always upbeat and happy. Watching him get sad actually made me tear up. What's worse is when he and Max run into a mishap involving a waterfall. Eventhough I know how it's going to end, I wanted Goofy to be alright. See? This is just an animated character. But you get attached to him after all he goes through. But now I'm making the movie sound depressing. Aside from a few moments like the ones I've mentioned, the movie's funny overall, and kids age 11+ will be sure to get a few laughs out of it. Bigfoot discovering disco music has to be one of these things.

The visual quality didn't get the best treatment here, but I'm hoping a Platinum Edition is in the works somewhere down the line. There's notable grain and smudges one the print, and it looks like a slightly cleaned up vhs version. But the movie was made in the mid-late 90's, so it still looks pretty good animation-wise. No jagged lines here. And the audio's nice and loud. The Powerline songs at the beginning and end are booming all over the place. Some sound effects are a tad quiet, like Goofy and Max stay at the underwater-themed hotel, but it's nothing you'll mind unless you're listening for things like this.

Here's the reason it gets four stars instead of five. While I was surprised when I went to the special features menu, and discovered some that were actually good, there weren't enough. I remember seeing some concept designs for Big Foot and a few other characters way back when, and it would've been nice to have had them here in some sort of gallery. Also, it would've been nice if Disney had given it as equally great extras as some other Gold Classic Classic discs. But what's here's still good. The first one I have to mention is an entire episode of the classic Disney Afternoon cartoon: Goof Troop. It's the ""Calling All Goofs"" episode in which a few of Goofy's relatives are having a reunion. Because Pete screws up Goofy's car, he can't go. So instead, Peg (Pete's sultry wife) has the reunion at their house. Of course, we all know how Pete is around Goofy. How will he handle more than one at the same time? It's pure chaos. Unfortunately, the transfer to dvd wasn't kind to the episode, and there are a lot of visual problems here and there (some images jump around instead of smoothly moving. Keep focused on a character when they're doing something, and you'll notice it). It's a funny episode still, and I was surprised to be laughing at it well over ten years after it first aired. It was nice seeing the whole crew, sans Chainsaw. Next, is the biggest extra of the batch- A Goofy Success Story, running over 40 minutes. It covers how Goofy became a household name. It goes well into his past, and is a must-see for classic Disney fans and animation fans in general. After this is the embarrassing A Goofy Movie dvd Storybook. If you remember those books on tape...with books included of Disney movies from the 90's, that's what this is...only you watch it. There's the option of having it read to you, in which the narrator sounds like he's talking to kids with ADD. This is actually worth a laugh, if only for what pictures they chose for each page. The first 3 had me holding my sides (go ahead an' say I'm immature. I don't care). What's almost as bad is the Disney Mambo No. 5 by Lou Bega. It's Mambo No. 5...but with some changes for a family audience and a Disney theme. What's somewhat sick is that he goes over pairings for characters. Like Mickey = Minnie, Donald = Daisy. But then he gets to Pluto, who in turn gets Huey, Louie and Dewy. Horrid. There's also a lame trivia game and the usual trailer to round things out.

That's all there is to it. Get A Goofy Movie. Don't even rent it, just buy it. We're never going to get another one like this.",1280966400,25,7077,4.334087481146304

678785,3,6303534422,"I wrote an entire review for this film and then realize that I was over thinking everything and that it was probably the most unhelpful review of a children's film ever written for this site.  It was starting to go over my own head.

HA.

So, I trashed it and started over.

`A Goofy Movie' is Disney's attempt at a father/son film.  It stars the likable goof, Goofy and his son Max.  Max is getting in trouble for normal teenage boy pranks pulled to impress a girl, but obviously his dad wouldn't understand.  Goofy decides to take his son on a trip in order to `help him' but that is not the help he wants.

`A Goofy Movie' has a message, a typical Disney schmaltzy message about family togetherness, but it's cute and effective to be wholly honest.  While it is far from the best animated film out there (and it pales in comparison to that other 95 mega-hit `Toy Story') it is sweet and has some charm to it.  From a technical aspect this film is mediocre.  The music isn't all that wonderful, although it has some catchy qualities to it.  It can at times seem lazy.  The humor is hot and miss, sometimes overly generic.  I mean, this cartoon has been done before MANY times with different characters.  There are not a whole lot of father/son type films out there, especially animated films, so this has that going for it, but I can't say that it really broaches the subject with much depth.

This film is targeted at the funny bone of a child, and that works, but it doesn't really do much outside of that small box.

I enjoyed this as a kid.  I'll admit that.  I was ten with this was released and I liked it.  I never flocked to it and I never owned it, but my friends did and I had no qualms with watching it at their house.

That said; it's forgettable.",1273017600,,1761,4.291793313069909
678860,4,6303534422,"Like the more lesser known DUCKTALES: THE MOVIE--TREASURE OF THE LOST LAMP, this film is also based on a famous Disney TV show, GOOF TROOP, starring, naturally, Goofy. That said, A GOOFY MOVIE feels somewhat disconnected from the show, as indicated by the style of the animation and the lack of certain characters around (Pete's wife and daughter Peg and Pistol, respectively). Not that it is a detriment at all, however; in fact, A GOOFY MOVIE is all the better for it. While there are laughs to be had, what really makes this movie is the fully-realized characterizations, particularly in the development of the relationship between Goofy and his teenage son Max, which serves as the central focus for the story.

Goofy (Bill Farmer, who has never been better) is cast as a suburban '90s father who bumbles his way through everything, including almost vacuuming up a prized cardboard statue and smashing a fence when driving his car out of the driveway. An admirer of old-fashioned things like Xavier Cougat, ""High Hopes"", and fishing, he is a frequent source of embarrassment to Max (Jason Marsden), who is going through that typical adolescent stage where girls, rock 'n roll, and social acceptance are more important to him. Smitten with one particularly pretty classmate, Roxanne (Kellie Martin), he plucks up the courage to ask her out on a date... but not before hijacking the last school assembly to put on an impromptu rock concert as his idol, a rock superstar named Powerline (Tevin Campbell, who gets to sing two of the movie's liveliest and memorable tunes, ""Stand Out"" and ""I 2 I""). Max does this to both impress the girl and win admiration from his classmates (who think he's, well, a goofball), but the exasperated principal (Wallace Shawn) misinterprets his actions as a case of being on a road to crime, a point that he overexaggerates in the extreme on a phonecall to Goofy. Needless to say, Goofy is horrified by the news and forces Max to go on a cross-country vacation with him to Lake Destiny to reestablish their bond. Of course, what Goofy doesn't realize is that Max, who has no choice but to cancel his date, boasts that he will be onstage at Powerline's newest concert in L.A. instead. This sets up a source of tension that escalates between Goofy and Max as they stop at rundown, cringeworthy ""resorts"" such as the shady-looking Lester's Possum Park (a very loose parody of Disney's ""Country Bear Jamboree"") and even get into an encounter with Bigfoot. (The latter experience culminates with the beast dancing to the Bee Gee's ""Staying Alive"" on Max's headphones.) Amazingly, though, Goofy and Max begin to bond as their trip progresses; but Max is still troubled by his predicament, and, thinking his father won't understand, he decides to alter the map so that they can go to the concert instead... ultimately realizing that telling the truth is the better thing to do.

Even with the presence of a iconic loveable bumbler like Goofy as the star, A GOOFY MOVIE is primarily targeted at teenagers, who will undoubtedly relate to Max and his adolescent struggles. On the other side of the fence, parents will also be able to identify with Goofy as he deals with his son's resentment about the vacation while trying to prove that all he really wants is for his son to be happy. It's not often to see such a complex development in a project which is disconnected from Disney's canonical features, much less one from a character best known for tripping on his heels or bungling simple tasks (ala the ""How to"" Goofy shorts). Ultimately, though, that's what gives A GOOFY MOVIE its heart. No character is portrayed as a purely perfect ""hero"" or a downright evil ""villain""; they are surprisingly more multi-layered than what you'd come to expect. Critics have often dismissed this film as a lesser effort from Disney, but A GOOFY MOVIE has achieved a loyal following, purely because of the surprisingly realistic, honest depiction of ""teenager"" relationships with their parents.  (It also marks the first time we've ever seen Goofy look genuinely crushed and betrayed, particularly when he discovers his son is manipulating him into going to some place other than their fishing destination, as well as having a heated argument with the boy immediately afterward.)

One issue that I do have with A GOOFY MOVIE, however, may be that some of the newer characters introduced, from cheese-guzzling Bobby (an uncredited Pauly Shore), to nerdy class president Stacey (Jenna Von Oy) to Roxanne herself all don't have much screentime. Since all three come across as very appealing newcomers, it would have been interesting to flesh out their relationships with Max and Goofy. Particularly Roxanne, who, although sweet and insecure, leaves one wanting to see her on that special date with Max. This ""tease"" somewhat grates on me, although not enough to bring down the film.

Technically, the animation in A GOOFY MOVIE (produced primarily at Disney's animation studios in Paris, Sydney, and Toronto) isn't as richly detailed as most of the studio's other films; frankly, though, it is both above-average and very well-suited to this kind of ""cartoon"". This is a major difference from the TV show, which mostly had pencil-drawn backgrounds that gave the show a bit of a sketchbook style. The more softer colors used in the film (and occasionally dramatic close-ups) lend themselves well to the more emotional parts of the story (notably when mean-spirited Pete tells Goofy about his son changing the map). The soundtrack is also a lot of fun; aside from the aforementioned rock songs, other catchy memorable numbers include the exuberant ""After Today"", the bouncy ""On the Open Road"", and the heartfelt ""Nobody Else but You"", all written by Tom Snow and Jack Feldman, respectively. Probably the only false note is the ""Lester's Possum Park"" singalong, but then again, that may be intentional, since the camp is supposed to be, as Max best describes it, ""pathetic"". Carter Burwell's musical score is also quite good, and arguably better than some of Alan Menken's instrumental scores for other Disney movies.

All in all, A GOOFY MOVIE may not rank as one of Disney's greatest animated films, but it certainly deserves better recognition. It works very well as entertainment and as a character study, yet as a starring vehicle for Goofy it's something quite different from what one would be used to seeing. That it holds up well even after being released in 1995 (even more so than most of the studio's post-LION KING films, excluding THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, MULAN, TARZAN, FANTASIA 2000, LILO AND STITCH, and the recently released THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, all of which I loved) is also remarkable.",1272758400,,6716,4.944198405668733

Emulating his pop-star hero, Powerline, Max pulls off the stunt long enough to gain major popularity points with his peers and get the date he was hoping for, but not without landing himself in the principal's office to boot. A phone call to his dad instantly foils Max's plans for a summer of love, as Goofy becomes convinced that he needs to spend some quality time with his son. Before he can escape, Max is whisked away on a cross-country road trip to Goofy's favorite fishing spot, but he manages to squeeze in one last talk with Roxanne on the way. Unfortunately, in a final effort to keep Roxanne from finding another date to her friend Stacey's concert watching party, Max promises to wave to her from the stage when he and his dad join Powerline in the final number! Suddenly, he's told the biggest lie of his life and has no idea how to get out of it. When Max decides to alter Goofy's treasured family map halfway through the trip and head them towards the concert in L.A., he finally starts to have a good time, but at what price?

""A Goofy Movie"" was a surprise gem from Disney in 1995 that surely would have made Walt proud! The writing and animation are top notch, with a completely original, believable, hilarious and charming father/son story expanding on the popular ""Goof Troop"" TV series from 1992. In this bigscreen feature, Max and his friend P.J. have moved on to high school, and Pete is still around to cause trouble for Goofy with his nasty demeanor and awful advice. Absent with no explanation, however, are Pete's wife Peg and small daughter, Pistol, and both Goofy and Pete now work as baby photographers in a retail store. The characters are just as we remember them though, and looking better than ever, only the older Max is now voiced by James Marsden. But don't worry if you never watched ""Goof Troop"" back in the day. This movie completely stands on its own feet as a solid and highly entertaining story of its own, and Goofy (Bill Farmer) and Pete (Jim Cummings) are not much different than they were in their classic Disney shorts. Some major new characters are created for the film too, like Pauly Shore's Bobby, a high school friend of Max and P.J.'s, and the adorable Roxanne, voiced by the equally adorable Kellie Martin. The film boasts some excellent original songs too, and just about all the goofy fun you can handle!

The Gold Collection DVD of ""A Goofy Movie"" is so close to being outstanding that it's a real shame they missed the mark by making it fullscreen only! Other than that, it is surprisingly generous with extras (for a Disney release), especially considering the quality of those extras. The two most notable are ""Calling All Goofs"", an episode of the TV series ""Goof Troop"" billed on this DVD as a ""Max and Goofy Cartoon"" and omitting the opening song, and ""A Goofy Success Story"", which is a wonderful episode of the old Disney anthology series in full color and introduced by Walt that tells the tale of how Goofy was discovered in Hollywood by talent scouts and became the award winning star he is today! That second program includes four classic Disney shorts edited to fit the context of the story, but more importantly, it includes a large amount of charming new (at the time) animation to tell the behind the scenes story of Goofy's success. In addition to those two excellent extras, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, a trivia game, and a read-along story of the movie that may seem pointless to us but would be great if you have young children. Though, an original story might have been better than just a read-along version of the film. Truthfully, I suppose it would also have been nice to have some more extras relating to the film itself, like character design art (especially for Roxanne) and a behind the scenes featurette, but with ""A Goofy Success Story"" and an entire episode of Goof Troop, it's pretty tough to complain about anything other than that fullscreen presentation. Fullscreen or not though, this film is a must own! If you don't have it, I highly recommend it! For the Goofy fan, the extras alone make it a worthy purchase! I also highly recommend the direct-to-video sequel, ""An Extremely Goofy Movie."" Yeah, it's lower budget, but it is far better than your average Disney direct-to-video sequel. And, seek out Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy if you don't have it already. I just wish they would hurry-up and release Sport Goofy in ""Soccermania"" to DVD already, not to mention ""Goof Troop"" in volume sets like they have for Duck Tales, Tale Spin, Gummi Bears, and Rescue Rangers. I suppose The Wuzzles should come first though. Disney, are you listening?",1200441600,6,4854,4.682669789227166

I'll admit a couple of the songs were a bit painful, but there are so many great gags and great sequences in this story I couldn't help but be impressed.  This is way better than some of the high-budget princess movies Disney was grinding out at the same time.  And this was done by Disney's second string  animators... wow!

I've seen the widescreen edition and it looks much better! The full screen version just looks like the sides got chopped off... the scenes feel a bit cramped. Aside from that flaw, this is a great DVD and worth buying, or at least renting. It also has an episode of Goof Troop as a bonus feature and a few other bonus features too. 4 stars only because of the absent widescreen version.

Who could ever forget Max's Powerline imitation, Bobby's ""Tower of Chessa"", Lester's Possum Park, Bigfoot dancing to ""Staying Alive"" or the lovely and demure Roxanne. This little gem of a film is an unforgettable adventure that will be enjoyed by the inner Goofy in all of us.

Six years had past since then and I hadn't seen it in a while until it came on the Disney Channel. Upon seeing it again I knew I had to own the movie.

The plot is sweet, and though Max shows obvious resentment towards his fathers ""goofy-ness"" and the obvious effect it has on him too, you get the sense that he really does love his father, he just forgot how to show it.

679162,5,6303534422,"The trick in most Goofy titles, is that the schtick needs to be paced. The cartoons allowed for a frenetic pace which was often offset by another characters style. Well, this movie  succeeds in sustaining the style of Goofy, with a story that has a cast of many other funny  characters.

For a Franco-American co-production, it does ( for me ) come as a surprise that this has been achieved. However, the answer lies in the traditional animation style, and a strong script.

Bill Farmer's voice work is totally  awesome in this film, as in the Casper series, and he captures the reinvented Goofy that came to screens with the series developed around or after the success  of DUCK TALES.

Stylistically, the Characters were re-done for the ""modern"" audience, and unfortunately were part of the Disney downgrade of the style of drawing that has led to the cessation of traditional animation methods. The problem I have with this is not the shift to a totally  computer generated  form, but that the style as evinced by people like the Masterful Carl Barks, but that for all the high tech  gadgets that Disney has its command, it cannot do the simple thing of copy the classic style.

Fortunately, A GOOFY MOVIE maintains the high visual standards, but is one of a limited number of films that led up to dross like TWICE UPON A CHRISTMAS.

The gags in this film are brilliant; case in point, Big Foots Dance sequence as the backdrop to a moving scene with Max and Goofy... its clearly a reference for Adults, since the music and the Dance sequence is so 70's. And the entire movie combines classic Goofy  material together with contemporary  references, in such  a manner that the style of the Saturday Cartoon  series that featured Goofy, Max , Pete, and etc, is emulated  very well.

If there's one thing I'm sick of, it's fathers being portrayed in the media as bumbling idiots...or insensitive control freaks and all the children in Disney movies it seems disrespect their parents.

I cannot think of a single Disney movie with a positive role model for a dad and with children who respect him, with the exception of Ol' Yeller, and in that case, the father is gone for 90% of the film.

This is about Goofy's son "" Max"" who wants to impress his girlfriend "" Roxanne"" by going to a special concert in Los Angeles played by his favorite sinfger "" Powerline"" ( who is sort of like a Goofy version of Prince), unknown to Goofy, Goof is actually taking Max on a fishing trip but Max decides to change everything so that he can impress her.
A highly entertaining, heartwarming and meaningful animated feature full of laughs, insight gags, good animation, great soundtrack and a important lesson about Fathers and Son.
If you're a disney fan, i suggest owning this movie on DVD and you won't be disappointed :)",1028505600,,710,4.5546875
679411,5,6303534422,"A Goofy Movie is cool!  The songs are only beat by the songs in ""The Lion King"".
In case you're wondering, here's what the movie is all about:
Max is Goofy's 15-year-old son.  He's not exactly the biggest man on campus.
On the last day of school, Max decides this calls for desperate measures.  He performs a concert at the morning assembly as teenage rock sensation, Powerline.
Everything works out fine...until the principal finds out.
The principal calls Goofy at work and tells him Max is headed for the electric chair.
A horrified Goofy takes Max on a road trip. Poor Max has just gotten the date of a lifetime.
Max tells his girlfriend that Goofy is taking him to Powerline's concert in L.A. (which he's not).
Don't miss this movie!  It's one of the lesser-known classics.

You just can't resist watching this movie that is for all ages. Especially if you're a teen, you can understand what it's like having to deal with a parent who just wants to do what's best for you, but you just want to be left alone.
It's a great family movie, about a vacation gone wrong, but when you think it was bad, it actually turned out good.
It has great catchy music, the plot thickens, it's a great kids movie that you can watch over and over and over again.
Buy it now, you won't be disappointed, after all we all love cartoons, especially Disney!",1022889600,,680,4.198473282442748
679499,5,6303534422,"""A Goofy Movie"" is one of my absolute favorite videos.  I've been marveling over this movie for years.  Everytime I watch this film, I can't stop myself from laughing.  The funny scenes never get old.  The story is about a young boy named Max, who is Goofy's only son.  Max throws a somewhat sort of concert at his school meeting and steams up the principal.  The prinipal calls up Goofy and completely exagerates Max's skit.  So then Goofy decides to take his unwilling son, who just finally got a date with the girl of his dreams, on a fishing trip crosscountry.  To make a long story short, everything that could poosibly go wrong does, and Max isn't quite getting along with his dad.  Goofy and Max eventually fall off of a huge waterfall before they finally realize that they really love each other.  But I'm not going to spoil the ending for you.  You'll just have to watch and find out, and I guarantee you that you won't regret it!",1005955200,,939,4.464705882352941
679500,4,6303534422,"Had this movie been made as a full fledge addition to Disney's classic library, this would not do. But just as a pleasent revisit to one of Disney's all time great characters, it better than O.K.
The movie deals with a story that I'm sure most sons and dads can relate to, the seperation that begins as the son grows and wants more independence. Max, Goofy's son, has a crush on a girl but a recent event at school leads Goofy to believe that he hasn't been paying much attention to his son. So Goofy plans a road trip for the summer, much to Max's dismay. But before they leave, Max lies to his friends by saying that he is going to L.A to a concert of a popular singer. When Goofy puts Max in charge of the map, he deceives his father by re-routing their trip through L.A., so he can be popular in the eys of his girl
The movie is well done, no contrived story or anything like that. Had it been inducted into the ""Disney Classic"" library, a lot more work would have needed to be done as far as quality goes.
The DVD unfortunately, does not present the film in it's original aspect ratio, but does make up for it by including two Goofy Cartoons, each about 20 mins. The first one is recent, ""Calling All Goofs"" dealing with a Goof family reunion. And the second one is vintage with Goofy helping Donald and Mickey escape from their angry (and unpaid) landlord.",1004140800,,1362,4.303501945525292

I watched it two times in a row in one day and fell in love with it! My babsitter asked if I wanted it. I sayed you bet I do! I love the addictive songs and the catchy music! I have the soundtrack too. It's about an uncool teenager, Max (voiced by Jason Marsden) who wants to act cool. But it's hard for him to act cool when his dad is ""Goofy."" (voiced by Bill Farmer) Everyone in his highschool always laughs at him because his dad always kisses him in front of everyone, and he falls over sometimes. But Max really likes this one girl, Roxanne. (voiced by Kelly Martin) Roxanne doesn't think he's goofy or wierd at all. But Max isn't so sure how to make her like him-except on the last day of school he thinks up a plan with his two buddies. So in front of the whole school he impresses her by doing a dance to his favorite music by the coolest rockstar on the planet, Powerline. (voiced by Tevin Campbell) After that he has to go to the principals office. Roxanne tells him she liked his dance. So they make plans to go to this Powerline party. Then the principal exagerates what Max did to his dad. Then Max finds out his dad wants him to go on vacation with him! He tells Roxanne a lie that he's actually going to the Powerline Concert instead of telling her he's going on vacation with his dad. I won't tell you anymore about the movie or I'll give the movie suprises away! This is a must have!!!!!!",998697600,11,1538,4.1644295302013425
679502,5,6303534422,"UPDATED Dec 6, 2017 FOR GRAMMATICAL AND STRUCTURAL REASONS. My views have significantly changed since the writing of this review, and I am a lot more Biblically grounded now. If you're not a Christian, do not concern yourself with that, just read my original review.

ORIGINAL UPDATED REVIEW 2001:

  I've seen this movie so many times I lost count It's one of the most underrated Disney films, and one of its best.  Although it was criticized at the time of its released for being overly sentimental and for Goofy being unsympathetic to Max,  those criticisms miss the point and heart of the film which shows the struggles between a teen son and his father very well in a very sincere (though exaggerated) way, that later films such as ""Inside Out"" attempted to capitalize on.  .

  A Goofy Movie uses the backdrop of imprending summer vacation and the fear of your son becoming a delinquent or dead due to a perceived lack of parental intervetion. In an exaggerated Goofy fashion, ""A Goofy Movie"" shows the fear and uncertainty that comes frequently comes along with parenting a teenager, and is still resonant today in 2018.  It accurately shows the pains of growing up, and how sometimes a chasm grows between parents and their child, especially in single parent households.

  This film always rang true with me because this is not far off from how I felt about my mom at times, and our relationship both suffered and flourished because of road trips.  Although I always had two parents, my father was mostly absent due to working grave yard shifts, so my mom mostly took care of us.  I definitely felt like Max, not wanting to be like my mother, but at the same time, knowing it was a little bit useless because I was her daughter, it was bound to happen, and so eventually, I realized some of the best parts of me came from my mother.  That theme forms the heart of this film.

The songs in this, even during the Powerline sequences, really grow the characters, they are not just songs for the sake of songs, they actually tell stories and build their characters up.  Especially ""Open Road"" and ""Nobody Else but You"", the former shows the chasm between the two characters, and the latter shows how they choose reconcile those differences and embrace their similarities and ""Goofiness"".

  A favorite sequence which really shows how things that were enjoyable for you as a child, may not be enjoyable for your teenager, is the scene at ""Possum Park"", which is a little heart breaking, but also a lot of fun.  The ""Possum Park"" sequence, more than any other section of the film illustrates how what was fun for us as children, may not be appreciated by our own children, this is not to say there is no value in those things, but it requires a different approach than Goofy's.

  A Goofy movie is a film that shows that when you try to see things from the other person's perspective, your relationship can flourish, particularly in a child-parent relationship.

This story is about Max, a teenage boy who doesn't really fit in, and Goofy, his dad. When Max pulls an outragous stunt to get a girl he has a crush on to notice him, it works! Max gets invited to watch the Powerline (a rock star) concert on tv with her. But when he gets home, Goofy surprises him with a father-son fishing trip across the country. The story tells about Max, his relationship with his father, and his desprate struggle to impress Roxanne. The original music is amazing and the stroyline is interesting and well done.
