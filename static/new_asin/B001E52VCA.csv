8296360,3,B001E52VCA,"This was an interesting short film, although it was not well-made, and a bit disappointing. The presence of a green-screen is obvious at one point in the film, which opens on the edge of a cliff in a beautiful, open area, probably in Hawaii or some coastal state with Amber (Debbie Bledsoe), a young married woman, standing on the edge of the aforementioned cliff. She is standing there when her husband, Jeff (John McMahand), pulls her from the edge, claiming that the land is giving way beneath her. Thus, Jeff questions her: ""What's wrong?"" This leads to Amber telling a story to her husband about when she was one-hundred-pounds overweight, and was in Maui with her sisters, standing on the edge of a cliff to jump from the edge and into the lake by the waterfall, the group of people below egging her on. However, she tells that she was frozen in fear, afraid to jump, and she stood there for thirty minutes, unable to jump. And then, there, at the edge of the cliff, with her husband, she wants to stop the laughter from the past...

""Frozen"" is by no means a good film, and it's not really horror -- however, the plot was as interesting as any plot for a horror film under five minutes can possibly be. I was expecting something more terrifying and paranormal to be the case behind Amber's flashbacks, but this is not the case. If you're looking for something paranormal and scary, then ""Frozen"" is not for you. I would say, though, that if you have an opportunity to catch this film somewhere, go for it -- again, it's not a good movie by ANY means, but it's worth seeing.",1268352000,,1580,4.505226480836237
