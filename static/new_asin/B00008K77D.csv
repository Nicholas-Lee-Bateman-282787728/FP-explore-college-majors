1848695,3,B00008K77D,"Not to nit-pick, but Hitler was not the aspiring artist after WWI in Munich; it was before the war in Vienna from 1906 to about 1911. The German army was not broken by the Third Ypres campaign in 1917; it folded after its almost successful offensive in 1918 (broken by American soldiers and Marines). So it goes throughout this dull and uninteresting film. The idea of presenting a young Hitler was fine and daring but this movie is watchable only for the fine performance of Cusack as Max.",1061942400,,490,4.579545454545454
1848696,4,B00008K77D,"""Max"" is an interesting albeit somewhat flawed work of historical fiction that explores the role of artistic frustration and failure in the personality of young Adolph Hitler. The film is essentially about the historical and psychological intersection of art and politics in young Adolph Hitler's thinking.
Max, played by John Kusack, is a wealthy Jewish painter who has been demobilized from the German army at the end of the Great War after losing his right arm and with it his artistic career. Instead, Max becomes an art dealer in Munich and opens an avant-garde art gallery in an abandoned locomotive factory. There he meets a young war veteran with a portfolio named Adolph Hitler (Noah Taylor) whom he takes under his wing and whose talents he attempts to nurture. Hitler, at this point in the film is quirky fellow to say the least. Impoverished, unattractive, erratic, and prone to hateful speech acts, the young corporal Hitler makes a strange foil to the suave, humane, and worldly Max-and yet the friendship between the two is extremely believable.
At this point in his career, Hitler has just been recruited by the military to make speeches about Germany's betrayal and to spy on upstart organizations such as the newly formed National Socialist (NAZI) party that he will subsequently wind up leading. Yet from the very beginning, Hitler is neither a mad man nor an avowed anti-Semite. When subjected to the Jew hating declarations of his commanding officers young Hitler claims that they are overly emotional yet he never rejects them completely either. One might say that at this point in the film, Hitler is as latently anti-Semitic as most other Germans in 1918, but it is not yet the basis of his murderous ideology. For his part, Max knows that Hitler is crude and resentful toward Jews to say the least, but this does not bother him. In fact one of the most interesting aspects of this film is the manner in which each of these people is exposed to the other's world. Hitler attends Max's gallery openings and meets his acquaintances. For his part, Max accompanies some of his fellow war veterans to a public speaking engagement where his friend, Hitler, delivers a pathetic and blustery speech to a largely disinterested audience. When explaining his actions to Max later on, Hitler states that this is merely a form of income and that he is just dabbling in politics.
Each man gets what the other is about but something manages to hinge their friendship together, and that something is art. After examining Hitler's portfolio, Max acknowledges his technical skills but informs him that he is undeveloped as a painter and that he must dig deeper. Putting his money where his mouth is, Max buys some of Hitler's future works on consignment and urges him to paint what he feels. This naturally raises the question of what might have happened had Hitler made it as an artist, but this is NOT the central message of this film.
Throughout the film, young Hitler is torn by forces that almost seem to compete with each other for possession of his artistic soul. On the one side is Max, who is benign progressive, optimistic and eager to shatter the assumptions of the past. On the other side, are Hitler's military mentors who convince him that politics are his art form and that people are his canvas. Most importantly, they convince him that there can be no future that is not firmly rooted in the past and that the past, like the military, is sacred.
Hitler neither accepts nor rejects the ideas of either party but instead fuses them together. After numerous frustrating attempts to paint, Hitler finally takes Max's advice and ""digs deeper"". The result is a series of sketches that look like they could have come straight out of Leni Riefenstal's film, ""Triumph of the Will"".
Hitler shows his sketches of soldiers, stadiums, monuments, banners, and swastikas to Max who immediately understands their artistic significance and promises him a one man show in his gallery. Fascism, as Hitler envisions it, is an equation of art, politics, and power. While an unknowing Max views these sketches as simply another phase in Hitler's artistic development, they obviously bode something far more ominous. On the night that Max and Hitler are to meet and go over the particulars of his gallery opening, Hitler gives his first speech to the National Socialists. In contrast to his earlier filth and impoverishment, Hitler is now clad in a shiny leather jacket and speaking in a respectable hall where he delivers a riveting anti-Semitic speech that rouses the entire audience. His best medium, it seems, is the political arena and not the painter's canvas.
In the interview portion of the DVD, director/writer Menno Meyjes states that he wanted to explore Hitler from a new perspective. In this film, young Hitler is neither insane nor even much of an anti-Semite. Instead, he is a failed artist and an opportunist. The implication of the film's final speech is that Hitler's odious career isn't based on the passion of his beliefs, or even upon hatred but on opportunism and the urge to succeed.
While some parts of the film are a bit overdone (the avant-garde art and architecture is projected more than necessary) it has many subtle touches. At one point after a failed bout of the canvas, Hitler looks upon himself in the mirror and slowly begins to slick his hair to one side. It's an almost laughable gesture to an audience that knows that, yes, that WILL be your future hairstyle, but it's also an interesting message that this person is still searching for his identity. Similarly, when Hitler gives the film's final climactic speech his normally clean-shaven face begins to show some hints of growth. The trademark moustache like the trademark hairstyle is making its appearance. The icon is almost complete.
I recommend this film to anyone interested in studying Fascism or the relationship between art and politics. While Hitler is the most fascinating character in the film, it in no way excuses or makes apologies for him. Instead, the film isolates a specific period in Hitler's life and asks why he made the choices that he did. Was
it really so inevitable?",1061424000,,6182,4.888571428571429
1848697,5,B00008K77D,"The movie follows the life of one Max Rothman, former Jewish artist who lost an arm in WW1, now art dealer who takes his job to heart. Wars and tribulations have cast realism in art aside forever - the tide has turned towards modernism, and Rothman exploits this new vein. During an exposition, he meets a fellow veteran, now struggling artist, named Adolph Hitler.
Hitler has technique down pat, but he cannot transpose his emotion on the canvas. As they gravitate around each other, Rothman and Hitler become aware of the stark similarities, but also differences, between them. Rothman is rich, Hitler is poor. Rothman is not racist, while Hitler is obsessed with race and blood and, like most of his countrymen, resents the Jews. Rothman believes in feelings, while Hitler ardently desires only one feeling beyond all - power. Rothman, despite having been in the army, did not like the experience, which he starkingly illustrates in a performance art piece that gives new meaning to the metaphorical expression ""meat-grinder"". While both resent the Versailles Treaty, only one of them is willing to use racism to rouse the masses against it.
This is, like most good movies, a movie of ideas before all, of words. One of the insights which Rothman gains is that words weave the world around us. And as politics becomes popularized and propaganda is developed, the minds of the population can be manipulated to support war. As the demagogue's sermon shouts out the Rabbi's sermon, the bloody reign of democracy marches on.
I am somewhat of an amateur of Hitler and all things Nazis (for the same reason that I am an amateur of Scientology : power relations are the ultimate test of human nature). For that reason, it was inevitable that I wouldn't *love* Max. After all, we are most critical of things we know. But I am still smart enough to recognize a good movie.
John Cusack can be counted on to play nuances, and Max is no exception. Noah Taylor makes the best of a character who is really pretty superficial and greedily ambitious, as the real Hitler was. The cinematographic tone is not really to my liking - it's as if they tried to be ""modernist"" too in some places. Also, the ending sucks eggs. They were going for the crowd-pleaser, in order to ensure that no one would accuse Max of trying to humanize Hitler (as if he was not a human being in the first place). Let's face it, they would say that anyway - no PC critic ever watched the movies he criticizes. In the end, I loved this movie, but its lack of courage bothers me greatly. I will probably rate it higher later on... for now, it is #20 on my top movies list, edging out Citizen Kane.

1848698,3,B00008K77D,"Max (Menno Meyjes, 2002)
Menno Meyjes (Empire of the Sun, Ricochet) steps behind the camera for the first time to direct his own controversial script. Like most controversial scripts, this one got built up a lot more than it should have by people who probably haven't even seen the blasted thing.
The story centers on Max Rothman (John Cusack), a wealthy Jewish art dealer not long after the end of World War I, before the massive German depression kicks in. He is a staunch modernist, but modern art isn't selling too well in a Germany that just got its head handed to it on a platter, and Rothman is looking for a new angle. He meets a young, promising artist by the name of Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor, from Almost Famous). Rothman and Hitler develop a testy friendship of opposites, with Rothman's libertinism and Hitler's asceticism grating against one another mercilessly, but the two men have a grudging respect for one another, and Rothmann has a genuine desire to help Hitler's career (if, one thinks, only for Rothman's impending success as an art dealer).
The story of the making of Max is a tale of Hollywood political correctness run roughshod over creativity. The film was originally to be produced by Amblin Entertainment, but Spielberg-though he thought the script a brilliant one-pulled out at the last minute because of fears of a backlash from the Jewish community. With production at a standstill, Cusack immediately forewent his salary because of his belief in the viability of the film. (In the end, it was produced by an international conglomeration of companies, including Film Council UK (Formula 51, Bend It Like Beckham) and Canadian producers Alliance (eXistenZ).) It is also a tale of how even unwelcome publicity is publicity, and by the time Max was finished, many people expected the best thing since sliced bread.
Max is a good film. About that there can be no doubt. But it is not a great film. While it doesn't, as Spielberg so euphemistically put it, ""dishonor the memories of holocaust survivors,"" it doesn't exactly tread much controversial ground, either; if the struggling artist had been anyone but Adolf Hitler, Max would likely have opened unheralded, played arthouses for a few weeks, and been seen afterwards only by hardcore fans of one of the movie's stars. The ideas in it are wonderful ones, and there is much that deserves criticism by those who are better at such things than me (for example, Rothman's constant exhorting that Hitler must find his distinct voice in art, and the wonderfully ironic resolution of that statement not long before the film's climax), but the film itself is just not quite the equal of all that. It ends up with the same general feel of 2001's In the Bedroom; a lot of great stuff that just doesn't gel quite right. ***",1056067200,18,2796,4.839248434237996
1848699,4,B00008K77D,"****1/2 Countless films have dealt with Adolph Hitler the monster, the madman, the unprecedented mass murderer.  But very few have attempted to go beyond this image, to conceive of Hitler in less than larger-than-life terms and to try to figure out what it was exactly that made this most infamous of modern dictators ""tick.""
This is certainly understandable, for how is one to ""explain"" an Adolph Hitler?  How is one to reconcile the man who was responsible for the deaths of millions with a flesh-and-blood person who lived and breathed like the rest of us?  The answers to these questions have eluded sociologists, psychologists and artists for decades now and it is the rare person who even attempts to provide us with some possible explanations.  It is for this reason that writer/director Menno Meyjes deserves extraordinary praise for bringing ""Max"" to the screen.  Is it possible for a single film - especially one that runs a mere 108 minutes - to successfully address this bewilderingly complex subject?  Probably not, but ""Max"" certainly takes a bold first step in trying to piece together this most mystifying of psychoanalytical puzzles.
Meyjes begins his story in 1918, immediately after the Germans have suffered a crushing defeat in World War I and now face further humiliation in the form of punitive measures meted out by the Versailles Treaty.  We see Hitler as essentially an embittered 30-year-old social misfit, a rootless, impoverished, down-on-his-luck painter whose work shows some promise but who keeps being told that he needs to find that ""authentic voice"" that will distinguish his work from that of his more successful artistic contemporaries.  One of the people who tells him that is Max Rothman, a wealthy Jewish art dealer who, like Hitler, served his country in the war and who, also like Hitler, has a good reason to feel embittered about the experience.  It seems that Rothman's career as a great and promising artist was cut short by the loss of his arm in battle.  Thus, while Hitler burns with a sense of nationalistic fervor (he blames everyone but the Germans - at least the Aryan ones - for his country's defeat), Max seems less inclined to declare total devotion to his country.  This is just one of the many points of contention that define this fascinating relationship between the two men.
What Meyjes is able to do so well is to show just how Hitler transitioned from being basically a petty angry young man filled with feelings of personal doubts and inadequacy to being a bold, confidant visionary of a new world order based on German domination with himself at the helm.  Through these two main characters, Meyjes paints a brilliant portrait of the times, of a country in ruins, of a people desperate to find scapegoats on which to pin their suffering.  Even Hitler's anti-Semitism is initially vague and ill defined until some army leaders groom him to become one of the spokesmen for their new system known as ""propaganda.""  Hitler is, obviously, a tightly coiled malcontent who, when he discovers he cannot convey his ideas successfully on canvas, changes his medium to that of speechmaking.  Max, who has been encouraging him to pour his feelings into his artwork and to stay away from rabblerousing in the streets and beer halls, can do little but sit back in awe watching this seemingly insignificant young man beginning to exert his influence on the world around them.  Although Hitler in many ways admires and respects this Jewish ""friend,"" he can't get beyond the burning envy he feels towards the easy life that money and a privileged family have bought for Max.  It is the great irony at the end of the film that Max becomes the unwitting first victim of Hitler-inspired hooliganism and violence and that, through this action, Hitler himself loses his opportunity to make a name for himself in the art world.  The closing scene has a kind of perfect symmetry about it.  These two men's lives intersect at a crucial moment in history, not in the way they intended, perhaps, but more as the result of a cruel trick of fate.  A great theme that runs throughout the film is the old ""what if"" scenario.  What if Hitler had been able to find acceptance in the art world?  What if the Treaty of Versailles had not exacted so harsh a penalty from the German people?  This theme is beautifully caught in microcosm in a scene where Max stages a small play lamenting the loss of his arm and his ability to paint and pondering over what works he might have produced had things turned out differently.
Because we know what ended up happening in the years following the events depicted in the film, ""Max"" is filled with a haunting sense of sadness and foreboding.  For instance, we see the Jews of Max's family enjoying their luxury and wealth totally unaware of what awaits them in the near future.  It's as if the Sword of Damocles were poised precariously above their heads, yet they are serenely unaware of its existence and the danger they are in.  Even the astute Max seems only vaguely cognizant of the threat Hitler and people like him pose to his way of life or the health and lives of those he loves.  For without the 20/20 hindsight that experience affords, who could ever rationally conceive that a man like the Hitler portrayed here could bring the entire world crashing down around him?  That, in fact, seems to be Meyjes' point, that ""evil"" can arise where we least think to look for it - in the banal, the mundane, the mediocre people who surround us unnoticed - until one day we wake up and see it all around us, when it is too late to do anything about it.  The real tragedy of the story is that Max, for all his insight into life and art, cannot see that the ultimate evil of our times happens to be standing right there next to him in a shabby overcoat and worn out shoes.  For much of the film's duration, Max sees Hitler as, essentially, a benign misfit, one who simply needs to channel his somewhat disturbing beliefs in a more positive direction, i.e. his artwork.  It is Max's obliviousness to the true potential of his ""protg"" that gives the film its air of chilling menace.  Meyjes writes dialogue that is sharp, sophisticated and meaningfully witty.  For instance, he embodies much of his theme in lines that grate on our ears and our sensibilities in their almost irreverent casualness, but which make perfect sense in the context of the story - lines like ""I'd like you to meet Adolph Hitler...I've never heard of him"" or ""Hitler, let me buy you a lemonade.""  Such statements throw us off balance and make us giggle - until we realize just how beautifully they portray the meaning of the work, that at one time Hitler was just a name like any other, not imbued with any special evil significance - just like the man himself.  We almost expect the people in the film to jump back in horror from his sheer presence or the mere mention of his name - yet how were they to know what was to come?  How were they to know they needed to flee or at least do something proactive to counter his growing influence and power?  These are the questions that haunt us.
John Cusack as Max and Noah Taylor as Hitler give brilliant, insightful performances.  Taylor does the well nigh impossible job of making Hitler seem strangely human while, at the same time, helping us to understand just how quick a leap it can be from disillusioned outcast to maniacal dictator.
""Max"" is a brave and noteworthy triumph, a film that takes chances and sets a high standard for future historical dramas on the subject.",1055635200,56,7563,4.705837755875663
1848700,4,B00008K77D,"The film ""Max"" poses a serious question: What if a Jewish art seller tried to help Adolph Hitler down the road of art instead of politics?

1848701,4,B00008K77D,"Max Rothman (John Cusack) is an art dealer and World War I veteran in post-war Germany. In 1918, he makes the acquaintance of another veteran and aspiring artist by the name of Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor). Hitler is a good draftsman, but is never able to convey any meaning or feeling in his paintings. Nonetheless, Rothman sees Hitler's anger, frustration, and self-doubt and encourages him to reveal those emotions in his artwork. Ultimately, Hitler finds that he cannot, but that politics is the perfect vehicle for his feelings. Defeat in WWI and the humiliation of the treaty of Versailles have left a void in the German psyche that radical new political movements exploit to their advantage. And Adolf Hitler comes to believe that Politics is the new Art.

""Max"" is a fictional film. Max Rothman did not exist. But Adolf Hitler was, in fact,  an aspiring artist of apparently little talent before there was any such thing as a Nazi. ""Max"" proposes a scenario of what might have transpired if Hitler had been befriended by a perceptive, sympathetic art dealer, who, nonetheless, understood the marketplace for art and  the shortcomings of Hitler's paintings. Why make a mostly fictitious movie about a very real and very loathed historical figure? ""Max"" places Adolf Hitler in the context of post-WWI Germany and shows us why his ideas found a substantial audience. More importantly, the character of Max Rothman is able to comment directly on Hitler's personal failings and idiosyncrasies, while providing an example of how Germans who were more saddened than angry at the nation's difficulties were dealing with the situation. ""Max"" allows us to see Hitler through the eyes of someone who understands him, is repulsed by him, but at the same time pities him. Rothman can say to Hitler what we might say to him had we known him at that time in his life. And Hitler can say what he might have said, given what we know of him, in response. This film is an interesting way of illuminating Adolf Hitler's character and motivations. ""Max"" elucidates the personal -not political- reasons for his actions. And all motivations are ultimately personal. John Cusack is particularly good here, successfully expressing Rothman's intelligence, charm, and resignation to life's realities. Noah Taylor effectively conveys Adolf Hitler's extreme emotional needs. Highly recommended.",1053475200,4,2371,5.1214470284237725
1848702,4,B00008K77D,"""Artist Denied 1-Man-Show Stages Holocaust, Kills 6 Million.""  That, in a nutshell is the premise of this film.  You almost wonder if someone is going to break out singing ""Springtime for Hitler,"" from ""The Producers,"" the premise seems so absurd.  However, actors Noah Taylor (Hitler) and John Cusack (Max, the art dealer) are both heavyweights and bring complete conviction to their performances.  Max is certainly the more amiable, likable and attractive man in this duo but Taylor's Hitler captures all the inconsistencies which must have existed in Hitler.  On one hand, he captures the revulsion this man naturally inspires and yet you can understand why, up on a stage, he can become mesmerizing and messianic to a crowd of disenchanted Germans who wish to revolt against someone, anyone, for the poverty of their lives.  Taylor especially captures the glittering, glazed, virtually hypnotic eyes of Hitler when he is in front of a crowd and launching into one of his tirades.  I found all the art aspects of the film very good and Cusack does a very good piece of performance art in it.  I don't know if Hitler's art is really as bad as shown in this film.  If you wanted someone to draw your spaniel (that drawing hangs on his wall), he was your man.  However, he wanted to compete with artists the likes of Ernst and Mondrian per this film!  If that is true, then no wonder he was doomed to failure as an artist.  The future Nazi henchman who draws him in as a leader for the movement even mocks his ability, looking at his spaniel drawing and sarcastically remarking about Hitler's artistic muse must be calling. Taylor's Hitler is a monster alright but he is a monster who is shaped over time. Here is the foundation of that shaping.  I am very eager to see Noah Taylor in another role after seeing him play Hitler. I can't really say this was a 5 star movie experience but it was a very good film in many respects.",1049068800,5,1927,4.632352941176471
1848703,5,B00008K77D,"Who hasn't wondered what the course of the world would have been if Adolf Hitler had succeeded as an artist and stayed out of the political arena?  The popular theory of some years back of the ""Butterfly Effect""--that the beating of a butterfly's wings could set into effect a chain of events leading to a hurricane or such--came into my mind as I watched this evocative period piece set in post-war Germany, 1918, as a 30-year-old Corporal Hitler checks out of the army and tries to get a showing of his art work.  At this point in his life political speeches are just something he does at the behest of his former Army superiors who have recognized his brilliance and intensity and wish him to tout their new National Socialist party.  Like the Hollywood parking valet or waiter who REALLY considers himself to be an actor, young Hitler sees himself as an artist.  If only he could have succeeded!  Events as small as that butterfly's beating wings, however, conspired to frustrate him and turn to the one thing he was doing well at that point in his life--rabble rousing in beer halls and lecture halls.  The actor portraying Corporal Hitler astonished me, whether he was showing a very low-key, depressed, starving artist with stubborn pride that bucked himself up despite apparent obscurity and failure or the terrifyingly effective political speaker learning his ""moves"" and vocalizations during his performances or the vegetarian, animal-loving naturalist who worried about caged birds in parks.  To the woe of the world, Hitler couldn't allow himself to be sufficiently vulnerable to show himself in his artwork; he instead externalized via the political arena (""Politics is the new art!"").  If some quibble that the actor doesn't resemble Hitler enough to be credible, focus on his eyes and check out some photos of Hitler circa 1918 or the early 1920's (I recommend the book ""Hitler Close-Up""); that chunky, full-faced look came later in his life.  Right out of the trenches, Hitler was quite lean.  This movie also features an amusing, wry performance by John Cusak as the German-Jewish art dealer Max Rothberg (who lost an arm in WWI; as the film points out, many, many German Jews volunteered to fight for their country); this character also allows some glamor and humor to lighten what could have been an unrelentingly dark film.  Cudos to Mr. Cusak for also backing this fascinating film (note the film credits) when he couldn't have failed to know it would not pull in the bucks like a feel-good movie would have done.  See this film.  Western Civization teachers, when this film is in VHS and DVD assign it for your classes; the course of history hangs by a thread at times, and everyone's reactions to choices in their lives can count.",1044576000,6,2753,4.869379014989294

1848750,4,B00008K77D,"The film Max (2002) not to be confused with Max (2015) about a dog I found to be a worthwhile experience.  I wondered why I had never heard of it, but then saw that it had a limited U.S. release on 27 Dec 2002, so obviously the distributor was trying to bury it.  I don't understand why the distributor would do that; just seeing Leelee Sobieski (mistress of John Cusack's character) on screen is worth the price of admission. To quote a line from the movie; ""even if it's a lie, make it interesting"", and this film is both. Of course, early on I'm already thinking ""give it up Hitler, the art ain't gonna happen for ya"". The settings and complex camera work are fantastic, with filming locations Amsterdam and Budapest standing in for 1918 Munich.  Max Rothman (Cusack) holds my attention, perhaps because I can't imagine the amount of effort having both a wife and a mistress would take oh, and because he's a Jewish person, a friend of Adolph, whom he meets in Munich after the 1918 armistice but before Versailles.  All three Battles of Ypres are portrayed accurately with the phrase ""we all s*** the same, we all scream the same, we all die the same.""  As an artist I of course found that part of the story interesting (the frantic search for a new vision), but don't understand how they could show a number of Grosz paintings on screen but obviously avoid showing a Max Ernst (though speaking about it for quite a few film frames).  I thought Noah Taylor did a fine job portraying Hitler, his mannerisms were very believable, as was his artistic search for his ""authentic voice"", which unfortunately Hitler finds.

1848801,4,B00008K77D,"Others have noted that this interesting fiction shows a side of Hitler not seen in history books.  The interaction between Max and Hitler (John Cusack and Noah Taylor) provides the best character illumination.  What the audience learns is how a luster-after-power like Adolf Hitler thought, before his rise to power, and incidently how many bullies and tyrants think.

The first glimpse of the Adolf character is a shot of him looking into the shop window of a (jewish) bakery.  Instead of just looking longingly at the food, as most hungry post-War Germans would, he is looking at the shop-owner with eyes of contempt.  We see more of this same contempt as Hitler speaks to his benefactor Max of blood and revolution.  Cusack as Max, plays the stoic pragmatist, unwilling to believe that Hitler really means the things he says.  What we get from the Hitler character, is his views on people, especially successful Jewish people.  In the interplay between Max and Hitler there is a repeated sense that Hitler not only dislikes Jews, but believes they have stolen something from him.  ""He had a bad war"", Max rationalizes.

Noah Taylor does a great job of showing both the madness, and cunning evil genius of the Hitler character.  You get a sense that when it comes to politics (his true calling) the Hitler character knows what he wants, and is almost smirking with glee that his Jewish benefactor does not.  When Taylor says ""I am the new Avant Guarde!"", he using the same words the actual Hilter did in the 1930's to announce his arrival on the world stage.  The way those lines were delivered, albeit in a different context, are still absolutely relevant to how Hitler thought.

This is an accurate view of the dictator personality: a sense of entitlement, contempt for what others have created, and an overriding desire to take with force what he believes he is owed.  If you like historical fiction of this period then 'Max' should be on your watch list.  If you are a person who want to understand more than just the rote facts, and are concerned about totalitarians in our current timeframe, then you should see this glimpse into the soul of a power-luster.

I couldn't in good conscience give it 5 stars, because that would be unfair to the very top calibre of movies. However there are some 5 star scenes in this movie, and the directing, editing, and acting are well worth watching.",1357948800,,2393,4.75544794188862

1848803,4,B00008K77D,"(Well, I'm not gonna write a treatise on politics and social philosophy, as some seem to have done. :-/  This is, after all, a film review.)

As usual, Cusack is excellent. His smooth yet flawed, good-natured but jaded, crippled upper-class war veteran is a perfect metaphor for all of the non-Nazis who lived in Germany between the wars... as well as a larger reference to the ""good Germans"" in any society who reject, yet dangerously ignore, the tide of racial and social hatred.

I suppose it's a matter of taste, but I can't see why some people rag on Taylor for his portrayal of the young Hitler. I mean, c'mon-- how would YOU play a somewhat talented, myopic and twisted loser who ultimately became one of the worst monsters of all time? Over-acted?? Hey, what IS a political demagogue, if not the perfect example of ""over-acting gone wild""? Only those who were actually there will ever know what Hitler was really like... and they're pretty much all dead. I think Taylor's interpretation is quite good-- appropriately pathetic, driven, confused, seethingly bitter, and at the complete mercy of happenstance.

Anyway, the point of the film (hence, it's title) is the art dealer, Max, and his quandary of how to encourage the talent of a twisted youth-- in whom he sees some real possibility, and for whom he shares a war veteran's common sympathy-- without unduly disturbing his own adventurous and bourgeois lifestyle, or possibly risking wasted time & effort on yet another artistic wannabe. It's as much a film about the art marketing world-- with all it's pretense, glamour, and quirks-- as it is about politics.

It's a testament to the skill of the filmmakers that you'll find yourself hoping, wishing, longing for Max to succeed in his attempts to turn Hitler's seething energy toward a successful approach to painting... even though you know that he never will.",1256860800,,1875,4.902208201892744

Instead they create a straw man, buffoon, fool, an utterly untalented artist loser who desperately seeks approval.  Of course, such a one could never have risen to the dizzying heights of power that his real counterpart did.  Except for the tirades and the hair, and of course the later speeches, one would hardly know who was being portrayed.  It would have been far more effective had they sought to present a realistic study of Hitler the young bohemian postcard painter (a period of his life that predates the one falteringly portrayed in the film), showing his early fanaticism and unflinching determination.  But that would have been much harder to pull off without the risk of appearing sympathetic.  Instead, it takes the lazy route and goes for stock moralization and easy answers.

Of course I realize that this is fiction, but when using actual historical characters one should take pains to present them true to life, and not be tempted to rewrite history.  Or else why use them at all?

This movie could have been an interesting study of contrasts, of art versus politics, of art as politics, and is not a total failure in that regard.  As an idea it had promise, and is worth seeing once, but it fell far short of what it could have been.

1848815,4,B00008K77D,"Its interesting to see the Hitler character face the reality that he is not, actually, an artist. You see the suffering when his long held and cherished view of himself gets dashed. In real life Hitler had artistic talent, but not what it takes to make a career out of art. Its interesting to see how the movie portrays his other pet project: politics. But the movie doesnt dare show the true strength of Hitler in this area. Instead they make it seem like his ability to speak and move crowds is a fluke and cartoonish and based only on repeating slogans. In actuality Hitler had a true genius with the spoken word..  a gift that unfortunately found its outlet and audience in the social chaos following WWI.

I think this movie does a decent job with a unique idea, and shows the early Hitler in an appropriately conflicted light.

1848818,3,B00008K77D,"I first caught a glimpse of this film when I was flipping through the premium channels and I came across a film that appeared to have a relatively interesting premise.  Needless to say I found it intriguing enough to attempt to track down.  Well I finally found it and I've watched it in it's full.  The movie starts off very strongly, but unfortunately it takes a fairly weak turn towards the end.  I'll go over this in some detail.

Now I will say that what really caught my attention was the fact that this is a movie about Adolf Hitler, for the most part, and post World War I Germany.  Basically the premise is between the end of World War I and Hitler's rise to power, what if Hitler had returned to realistically pursue his art career rather than go immediately into politics.  I have to admit, it's a very interesting and ambitious supposition.  To further make this of interest to us the primary encouragement Hitler has to pursue art is an art dealer named Rothman, who also happens to be Jewish.  Surely this throws a kink into the character of the anti-Semitic ruler history knows.  Again, another ambitious supposition.  Unfortunately the movie has some striking weak points and a lot of that had to do with Hitler's character.

First I'll talk about Cusak's character Rothman.  It's pretty clear the viewer is supposed to really like this character and also dislike him.  Both Rothman and Hitler have this duality in the film.  He's an enjoyable and cynical fellow, but his infidelity puts a black mark on his character, so he's not flawless.  There's certainly no taking the high road here.  I thought this was wonderfully played by Cusak and I think Rothman was the better developed character in the end.  This is probably also due to the fact that I didn't have any preconceived notions of who he was prior to going into the film.

As far as Hitler is concerned I think they got his character wrong on many fronts.  It was as if Noah Taylor never actually studied anything about the historical Hitler except for a few snippets of what pop-culture has to show us, but there was no depth!  I feel I should point out here that I have read ""Mein Kampf,"" I've read ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" and I've read a few speeches given by Hitler.  Unfortunately the Hitler that these writings portray is not the one we have in this film.  Taylor's Hitler is a very meek man, one who is uncertain of his abilities on every front.  However, it is alluded to that he understands a great deal about the political situation of the times and is very well read (this is close to the historical Hitler).  In this film you are intended to pity Hitler and I can't help but think that you are supposed to believe that Hitler didn't want to be anti-Semitic.  Sure he harbored the beliefs in the film, but due to his friendship with Rothman you are led to believe that he may not have really believed any of it.

However, when one sits down and reads Mein Kampf he truly believed everything.  In fact he believed it passionately through and through.  In this movie it is the military that urges him to begin speaking in public.  However, Taylor doesn't exude the strength the true Hitler had for public speaking.  Most of the speeches presented in the movie are far from eloquent or even remotely rational.  Having read a couple of speeches that Hitler had given, even early on in 1921, I am confronted with a Hitler that really thought out his position.  He was very rational in connecting the dots to his conclusions.  Granted they were entirely wrong on many fronts, but it doesn't change the fact that they were very methodical.  The speeches Taylor gives in this film are not eloquent in the least, they're not rationally presented and they did nothing to make me feel like I was watching the confident leader of the Third Reich.  Most of the speeches consist of saying ""We were stabbed in the back"" numerous times and in one speech that supposedly swayed the crowd on a major scale concluded with him yelling ""Bloodjew"" numerous times.  I'm sorry, these lines just lacked passion and they were the majority of the ""speech"".  Only in the final speech does he deliver a single sentence that even remotely goes down the path the real Hitler would have, but the movie does not keep that up.  Just because Taylor is physically yelling the line does not mean he gives off a feel of passion.

I fully understand what ""Max"" was trying to do in their portrayal of Hitler.  It has the added ""what if"" scenario in terms of Hitler being primarily influenced by the army to go into public speaking when he really wants to commit to an art career.  I realize that art was a major influence in Hitler's life growing up and as he got older.  In fact he goes on quite a bit about the importance of art in ""Mein Kampf"", so you can tell he still had a passion for that subject.  The movie ends in a manner that shows no matter what happens history cannot be changed.  It's also a film that focuses quite a bit on art concepts, so it is helpful if you're fairly open minded as a viewer.  I do consider myself to be fairly open minded, but I just wasn't buying into their portrayal of Hitler.  I think Taylor did a good job acting this out, but I don't think he was distinctly trying to be the historical Hitler; this may not have been his decision.  He may have been doing what the writers and directors asked.  If they asked him to play Hitler in this fashion, then he did it perfectly.  Nevertheless, for the historian in me, I couldn't buy into it and it really put an end to the film for me.

I have no doubt that many would consider this kind of movie somewhat controversial and provocative.  It does make you think about the different possibilities that exist within any kind of timeline (don't worry; I will avoid the drawn out concepts of parallel universe theory in light of quantum physics).  I honestly can't fully recommend the film as a good drama, because it just didn't pan out in a sensible way.  It was almost like there were too many ""what if"" scenarios for me to really get behind the plausibility factor.  Maybe if you're a much more forgiving person you can find some real merit in this.  I mean, I thought the premise and acting was pretty good, just the overall execution didn't pan out for me in the end.",1208304000,6,6316,4.4872918492550395
1848819,2,B00008K77D,"Some time ago British TV made the sitcom ""Heil Honey I'm Home"", an over-the-top Honeymooners/All in the Family send-off featuring lovebirds Hitler and Eva Braun living in a Lebensraum-challenged flat in suburban England, next door to their wacky neighbors the Goldensteins. Now imagine that someone took that show, deleted the laugh track and marketed it with some serious sounding tag line like ""a disturbing look into the heart of Evil."" That is basically what ""Max"" is. I mean, for crying out loud, is it even possible to think up a more ridiculous premise than a 30 year old Adolf Hitler becoming best buddies with a decadent, left-wing, upper-class Jewish performance artist? What's the  next project for dramatic revisionism? Josef Stalin's early career in a lesbian ballet troupe?

Even if one could accept such a far-fetched conceit, the historical and stylistic blunders are too large to overlook. For some reason Hitler has a funny, foreign accent; Cusack does not. The movie leads us to believe that Hitler was converted to anti-Semitism by a puppet show produced by right-wing army officers, when in reality his pre-war experiences in Vienna had already turned him against the Jews. Most jarring of all is that this movie's Hitler is a diminutive, charmless, greasy nerd rather than a man who, as we know from history, was a charismatic, magnetic leader from earliest childhood.

The movie isn't totally laughable; the sets and costumes and general atmosphere achieve an admirable effect. However, the storyline is a bad joke and the characterization consists of the same stock caricature that Hollywood has been using since the war. It's a bore and a failure.

1848820,5,B00008K77D,"What makes a movie like this fascinating is that it provides a fictional, yet accurate portrait of a well known persoanlity.  This story concerns itself with a little known part of Hitler's life.  His post WW1 years when he struggled to identify himself as either artist or political demogogue.  The movie tantalizes us with the notion that at this critical moment had Hitler's life taken a different turn the whole 20th century might have been changed.  This is quite compelling stuff.

The actors are brilliant in this film.  I am not normally a John Cusack fan, but his in-your-face contemporary style of acting works well here.  The actor playing young Hitler does a supurb job.  He manages to provide a human portrait of this infamous person, while making him appear pathetic and loathsome at the same time.  Many might think it is dangerous to put a human face on this horrible person, but how else can we understand what he became without trying to do this.  To see the evolution of his character which is done brilliantly here is to provide a greater understanding of Hitler and people like him.  How could this pathetic person shown here become the future dictator of Nazi Germany?  One wonders indeed.  History is full of such ironies, and this is certainly one of the greatest examples.  Ronald Reagan was considered a joke 20 years before he became the icon of the Republican Party!

The point to consider here is how many examples of this exist today.  How many marginalized, and frustrated persons exist in our society today who might one day become such persons or commit such crimes.  In seeing this portrait of a frustrated, loathsome person one is reminded of the many moslems who live in the West and feel repulsed by it.  What might any one of these individuals do one day with their repressed hatred of all that is Occidental.  In looking at this film I find many chilling examples today of what might be.  While this is fiction based on fact, this film does a brilliant job of showing us the evolution of character to become one of the greatest tyrants of the last century.  While imperfect perhaps, this is certainly worth watching and will provide some chilling moments for reflection.  Highly recommended.

One fault I found with the DVD production was one of the worst jobs I've ever seen with English subtitles.  Someone was used who did not have an innate knowledge of Engish, resulting in some pretty funny, but alarming translations!

1848821,5,B00008K77D,"Of all of the films released during the past ten years, this might be the most underappreciated.  The script alone is one of the most fascinating and intelligent ever brought to the screen.  There are thousands of war films, but this one brings genuine insight as to the way nearly all wars begin - in the heads of people who are really not much more than maladjusted victims fueled by a thirst for vengeance against enemies real and imaginary and a desire to find relief from fear and feelings of worthlessness through gaining power and dominance.

Noah Taylor provides a pretty effective Hitler, but it is John Cusack who is truly masterful in the title role.  He plays an extremely interesting, multi-dimensional character who is both an idealist and a cynic.  Virtually every one of his lines is thought-provoking, and, though his vision of what is truly right is so much deeper and wiser than that of his artistic protege Hitler, he is no saint, only a flawed man struggling to find a way to express his art and his truth.

The supporting cast does an excellent job, and the direction is first-rate.  The film is dark both in theme and in visual effect, and many of the shots are nearly perfect in their ability to communicate the darkness of post-WWI Germany, and the troubled and tortured people in it.  The scenes shot from inside the art gallery are unforgettable.

What it was that was in Hiltler's heart and soul that made him do what he did is a question that anyone who studies world events sooner or later comes to ask.  This film gives an answer that is truly insightful and fascinating from the opening shot to the closing credits.  No one who appreciates intelligent and original filmmaking should miss it.",1182384000,2,1723,4.672185430463577
1848822,1,B00008K77D,"John Cusack seems to have been delusional when he said that Hitler was portrayed in this film as a ""human being,"" rather than as a ""monster,"" a ""cartoon caricature,"" or as ""pure evil.""  That is exactly how Noah Taylor's character came across on the screen.

Let us assume that Hitler was the vilest, most sinister character in the history of mankind, the fact is that he conquered Europe in the 20th Century and might have conquered even more of the world if he had not succumbed to a Russian winter, just as Napoleon did.

There is no conqueror in history who was not ruthless, driven and tragically brutal, from Alexander the Great through the Caesars and Genghis Khan, and Napoleon, Stalin and Hitler.  However, none of them would have risen to the pinnacle of power if they were anything like the bumbling idiot and creepy, inarticulate nobody depicted in this film.

Indeed, the Normandy invasion was dicey at best; and if we had not succeeded, the history of the world would have been far different than it is today.  Clearly, an utter buffoon did not hold Western Civilization in the balance, much less the one portrayed in this film.

While Cusack is a fine actor, as his performance here reaffirms, surely he is better than lending his talents to being part of such a meaningless farce.  The audience is kept waiting for Taylor's character to morph into a ""conqueror,"" or even the faintest shadow of one, but it never happens, by design.

This movie was a waste of the money that it took to film the credits, leave aside everything else.  Apparently it grossed $540,000 worldwide, yet it is surprising that it made a dime.  Perhaps it would have been more believable if the Hitler character had been omitted altogether, and if the somewhat-interesting story of Cusack's ""Max"" had been expanded.

Rothman meets Hitler and sees promise in his work as an artist and tries to persuade him to forget about politics and search within to help develop his art further. But Hitler is torn between his art and politics no matter how hard Rothman tries in boosting his esteem in furthering his art.

The film focuses on both characters equally and shows what they were like. Hitler is a loner who doesn't get along with anyone and Rothman is the respected family man who screws around. Taylor is good in his role but found his portrayal unconvincing. I found Cusacks performance to be dull. The film itself is photographed as if it were multiple canvases on a slide show,which isn't necessarily a bad thing,except that some scenes go on for way to long,pan out scenes and stedy shots of people walking away until they are out of scene should have been edited down as this film is too long. I spent the majority of the film waiting for something to happen such as seeing Hitler do his drawings but we never do. The only time that we see him doing so is when he's trying to paint,in which he is never able to do. Instead of focusing on Rothman's infidelities i thought it more important to see the artist at work.

1848825,4,B00008K77D,"""It doesn't have to be beautiful.  It doesn't even have to be good.  It just has to be true.""

While ""Max"" is a historical movie, taking place in Germany after World War I, it shouldn't be viewed as a historical document.  The movie has a much more powerful point to make about the nature of art and what the creation of art can come to mean to the creator.  It's more of a ""what-if"" story, raising questions about what might have been had things turned a little differently, had chance played some different cards for a young man struggling to express himself -- a young man named Adolf Hitler.

Perhaps the most daring thing the film does is to actually treat the subject of Hitler without demonizing him, without casting him automatically as the monster. The film is not especially kind to Hitler -- in it he is portrayed as nervous, reactionary, arrogant, opinionated, prejudiced against Jews (though he repeatedly protests this) and not particularly intelligent (though not stupid either).  However, he is also not shown as the pure evil many would associate him with.  He doesn't kill puppies, he doesn't hurt anyone, and other than one memorable scene, he doesn't even get very violent at all.  Through the film we see him trying to develop his expression along two lines: the visual arts, which he has struggled with since before his service in the war, and the art of politics, which is really the art of swaying public opinion.  He goes back and forth between the two; as one seems to be succeeding, the other is left lagging for a while.

The performance of Noah Taylor as Hitler is really the standout role in the movie, but the other actors are also quite good.  John Cusack plays the title role of Max, a former artist, now an art dealer due to the fact that he lost his right arm (his painting arm) in the war.  Through the film, Max also struggles with expressing himself in different ways, and is frustrated several times.  Max, however, seems more resigned to his life after the war, and Cusack plays the character with a subtlety and complexity that is remarkable.  The lovely Molly Parker plays Max's wife, who is supportive of him, even when she knows he is having an affair.  Leelee Sobieski plays Max's sometime lover, also supportive of Max, though in different ways.

But it is Taylor's performance that I keep returning to when I think of the movie. He played Hitler not as a monster, not as a simpleton, not even as an ideologue, but just as a man -- a frustrated, flawed man who had lots of ideas but didn't know what to do with them.  At first, Hitler seems to fear the blank canvas; it's a feeling any artist knows well, the intimidation of possibility on an unmarked page. At one point, he paints a single tiny line...and then stops, uncertain of what to do next.  Max repeatedly entreats Hitler to ""go deeper"" in his art, to explore his feelings and paint them.  Finally, in a powerful scene, he does so: Hitler returns from an outing with some girls Max knows, angry at himself and at them, and now he can work. He slashes paint onto his canvas, mixing colors indiscriminately, hitting the canvas with the brush, grimacing, sweating, breathing hard...and then he stops, and looks at what he's done.  A few moments later, he destroys it in rage.  We never get to see what he painted, which makes you wonder all the more -- was this what might have been?

Of course, we know how this story ends.  It's no spoiler to say that Hitler eventually abandons his visual art and devotes himself to his dark political visions of the future.  But it's the way this happens -- more because of his own choices and limitations rather than anyone else's -- that makes the film so compelling.  One is left with the impression that, had he made different choices, or had he devoted himself to the visual arts more fully, a great disaster could have been averted.

There's another way of looking at the film which is a little frightening, but no less valid for that. At one point, Hitler says that he ""knows"" he is destined to be a great artist, someone that will be remembered.  As he turns more and more in the direction of fulfilling his political vision, as his strange visions of the future become his outlet, I began to wonder -- perhaps he was right.  Some artists are remembered for their most offensive works, for the things that leave the deepest impression because they disgust. Hitler's final work was not beautiful, and it was far from good. But maybe, for him, it was what was true.

""Max"" is a movie which engenders this kind of thought process.  It is not a perfect movie, but it is a thoughtful, subtle movie -- worth seeing for anyone, but especially for those who are willing to consider the possibilities of art and of creation, and to see that the most infamous man in recent history was still just a man. In one way, it is comforting to think that Hitler had flaws just like anyone else, that he was human, that he wasn't larger than life. In another way, it is deeply troubling.

This is the essence of what ""Max"" is about -- we all start with a blank canvas. What we do with it, what happens in the process, and the consequences of our act of creation, all result from our own choices.",1119571200,5,5223,4.529286474973376
1848826,4,B00008K77D,"A fictional ""what if"" account. Max Rothman, an art dealer and WWI veteran meets young Adolf Hitler, an aspiring artist in Munich. Rothman encourages Hitler's art, attempting to mentor him, but the two end up arguing, and Hitler is angsty and unfocused. Hitler appears to be the kind of guy who is gung ho for whatever ignites his passion in the moment, and unfortunately art did not take a stronger hold than politics. Max tried to encourage Hitler to find his own voice-artistic voice-but Hitler eventually found his platform - a dangerous one-after being something of a dismissed misfit in all his other previous incarnations. This is a fascinating take on the question of what if. It imbues personality and complexity and depth to the man Hitler might have been before he rose to power. There are several reviews here on Amazon that are extremely well written and convey the foreboding, ominous feeling one feels while watching this film, knowing what happens in real life.

All we ever hear is that he was a great speaker. Which seems to let all the listeners off the hook. Hitler had a country behind him. He didn't do this all by himself. I think the premise of him being a successful artist and therefore getting out of politics is pretty interresting. JUST IMAGINE IF GEORGE W.

1848828,3,B00008K77D,"While the film is interesting from a conceptual point of view, it has a difficult time of pulling you into the movie.  The film deals with the ficitous view of what if Adolf Hitler would have been an artist instead.  Where it fails its point is that the anti semitic views were already there in the culture.

What you do see is an akward Hitler that while not anti semitic must choose which life he will lead.  He seems to reluctantly to choose the military life, simply due to a tragic twist of events.  I feel this premise is somewhat weak, but it does make for an interesting movie.

Performances are good from John Cusack, but the Adolf Hitler performance seems brilliantly akward and at times painful to watch.  Adolf Hitler does not learn the oratory craft easily, it comes in time.

My opinion of this movie, is that unless this is a topic you are intersted in, or if you enjoy movies with the what if's, you may want to skip this movie.

1848829,5,B00008K77D,"This is a great movie that gets people thinking about how an evil dictator such as Adolph Hitler came into being by examining his younger days as an artist in Vienna during the forming of the Nazi party. As a european ""history"" ""student"" pointed out in a previouse review it is not historically accurate. But movies are art, and unlike history, which is always written from a point of bias or blandly with dull facts, they get people thinking creatively in order to come to their own understandings.

To me the conflict is between Hitler's love of art, and the need to be in control, which hinders him because he is simply not able to let go and create any piece of work. He is rigid, cold, logical, and a perfectionist when he attempts to create art and is unable to express himself, which many artists may have exerienced at on time or another. I produce music and sometimes I think too much about what the song I'm writing is accomplishing or going to accomplish rather than just writing it, and to Hitler every piece of art should have meaning and be better in technique than previous works of art. So Hitler, who is acted well by Noah Taylor, can't seem to release his feelings on a canvas. He finds his niche that allows him to vent his feeling of frustration and anger and starts doing rousing political speeches for a group affiliated with the army where he yells rants and raves like an unsuccessful artist would rant against the glamorous pop culture we have.

1848832,4,B00008K77D,"A standard question concerning ethics asks if you could go back in a time machine and have the chance to kill Adolf Hitler as a baby, would you do it?  Another ""what if?"" concerning Hitler has to do with his attempts to be an artist.  Hitler's artwork is rather cold and uninspiring, but it seems reasonable to speculate that if he had been a better artist he would not have turned to politics and the 20th century would have been completely different.
Writer-director Menno Meyjes explores this idea in the 2002 film ""Max,"" in which Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor) is still living in military barracks in Munich as Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles and is trying to make a name as an artist.  He shows his work to Max Rothman (John Cusack), a Jewish art dealer who lost an arm in the World War and who is consumed by the idea of the subversiveness of modern art.  Hitler disparages such ideas, considering them ""blood poisoning.""  Rothman and Hitler argue about art, both in terms of the futurist movement and Hitler's lack of an ""authentic voice"" in his own work.
Meanwhile, at the barracks of the decommissioned army, Hitler is folding laundry and being courted by Captain Mayr (Ulrich Thomsen), who is teaching a class on propaganda.  Mayr is a historic figure and it is in his responses to Mayr and others in the barracks that Hitler is his most articulate and persuasive in dispensing his particular brand of venom.
The major fault I find in this film is that both the script and Taylor's performance play too quickly to the ranting Hitler.  One of the great distortions of Hitler's legacy is that the black & white film footage of Hitler speaking comes from the climax of his speeches, when he has worked himself and his audience into frenzy.  But Hitler always built to such a crescendo. He would show up late for speeches, making his audience wait in anticipation, and then stand there until the audience got quiet, and then would stand some more, building the drama.  Then he would begin speaking softly, so that his audience strained to hear him.  Hitler was a devastatingly effective public speaker and every time his oratory is reduced to rants and raves we have an incomplete and inadequate understanding of the monster.
What lies at the heart of the film is the idea that you either take the view that Hitler is a madman born in sulfur who wrecked havoc on the world or that he was a kind of hustler.  Meyjes goes with the later view, presenting Hitler as a frustrated artist whose evil was rooted in that frustration and his inability to express himself.  It is in his engagements with Rothman and Mayr that Hitler finds his ""authentic voice,"" and comes to the fatal conclusion that politics will be his art and the German people his canvas.
""Max"" ends the relationship between Rothman and Hitler on an ironic note, which is exactly what I expected.  After all, by both his failure and his success with Hitler, Rothman is pushing Hitler towards the horrors of Nazi Germany, and his fate in the film symbolisms what is to come.  Meyjes is not trying to tell a true story here; after all, Hitler had a handlebar mustache during this period after the war, but having Taylor play the future Fuhrer clean-shaven seems appropriate for this provocative story.
Of course this film is provocative; it should be.  Reducing Hitler and the Nazis to being anti-Semitism misses the whole fascist dynamic of the struggle towards order that became the Cold War mentality.  Meyjes takes the rather simplistic idea that if someone like Rothman had been a better patron to Hitler the artist that everything would have been different.  But the script is so intelligent and the performances so compelling for the most part that we are willing to think along these lines at look at Hitler in a new light.  This does not mean that we see him as being a better person, but rather than we better see him for what he was by considering how he became that way.",1085097600,19,3950,4.650862068965517

1848834,4,B00008K77D,"This enigmatic film title ""Max"" can be switched into ""Adolf When He Was Young.""  The film is about a then failed young artist Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor) and a fictional art dealer Max Rothman (John Cusack).  Before he led the whole nation to another violent war, Hitler was trying to make it as a painter, but he failed in the entrance exams for the art school.  Now, the film gives a question -- What if he saw his life in a different way?
""Max"" is set in 1918 in Munich, Germany.  The post-war nation was suffering from the poverty and unemployment, and the distinction between those who have and those don't was too clear.  It was the time of unrest for them, for many of the Germans considered their country was humiliated by unjust treaties.  They are defeated, but still defiant.
Max Rothman is among the rich, dealing with avand-gard arts in the deserted factory.  One day, he meets a struggling artist (so he thinks) Adolf Hilter at the backdoor of the building.  He realizes that Hitler served in the previous war (Max lost one of his arms because of the war), and Max takes a pity on this miserably-clad small guy.
Then Hitler comes to him with his sketches, which Max thinks lacks the artist's inner voice.  But we know Adolf was the son of the era, when everything was bleak and empty.  And while Max encourages to find his own voice in the art, Adolf, constantly dissatisfied and angry, finds it in another quarter -- political speech.
The rest is history, as people say, and how the film ends does not matter.  We know the outcome from the first.  Still the film poses a question that is worth considering -- ""Can he be anything else?"" -- and more importantly, perhaps, ""How could this small man with squeaking voice could move the whole nation in the tragic way?""
Molly Parker (""Kissed"") appears as Max's wife, and Leelee Sobeski as his mistress.  But their roles are not as big as the two leads, to whom ""Max"" belong exclusively.
Noah Tayler did an astounding job, making Hitler not a monster but someone who could have been different.  He gives Hitler's slightly cartoonish images when we jeer at him, a deep meaning of its own -- frail, nervous, and eccentric -- all belong to the trait of some artists.  But behind that pose of his self-importance, we see something very destructive.
Don't see the film for the story.  See that as a character study against the background of the nihilistic world of the 1918 Germany.  The photography (which reminds me of somber Eastern Europe films) capturing the grey city has its own power, like watching the hanging clouds before the rain.  The cameraman Lajos Koltai's picture (actually set in Budapest) is itself a piece of art.
""Max"" shows too many dialogues, and perhaps too introspective sometimes.  But the film deserves our watching, and the theme is worth our considering.  No wonder John Cusack did it without receiving money.",1082246400,3,2891,4.675889328063241

My opinion of the viewing public, though, is that mostly it doesn't want to think this hard during a movie and particularly doesn't choose to understand the face of evil. (We might recognize it . . .)
Briefly we enter a movie cocoon. The one created for us. We want to be swept away, titillated, made to laugh, or cry, but not to think.
It (the public) wants to look at the evening news, see evil doers in other places in the world and then be able to turn off the set.
Max keeps it playing in your head.

(Sort of a scary concept considering my own drive to get a screenplay filmed.)
With Hitler there was the strange blend of politics as art . . . perhaps there is this with other politicians, too.
Perhaps politics is their art, when we think it is their vocation. And we would be part of their creation process, wouldn't we? As Max Rothman hoped to be part of Hitler's.",1078617600,4,1534,4.082781456953643

I believe jealousy, greed, and avarice are very much a part of the human condition and its only through the grace of God we are not lost.
I say this to illustrate a point. MAX is the story of two men, each on a quest to do something good. Each has a noble goal and yet both end up on a collision course with History. The first man is Max Rothchild (John Cusak, High Fidelity) a German Jew who has just returned from WWI missing an arm. He has settled back into his comfortable life of wealth and prosperity, with his beautiful wife (Molly Parker, Kissed) and his beautiful children. He has a mistress (Leelee Sobieski, My First Mister), and is a chain smoker. He probably drinks more than he should as well. He is also unable to do what he really loves, which is paint, so he does the next best thing. He becomes an art dealer. If he cannot create art why not discover the next great artist.
The other man is Adolph Hitler (Noah Taylor, Almost Famous) a German, who has returned from the war with nothing. He lives in the army barracks because he cannot afford a home for himself. He follows the rules and is straitlaced. He will not smoke. He does not drink (not even coffee) and he loves his country, a German all the way. But he does long to be a great artist.
One day these two men start a relationship. It is amicable if strained. Max takes Hitler under his wing. Trying to get him to open up and embrace his art. Hitler becomes fed up and is dragged away from his art by the army. They have given him the platform he's always wanted, and with this platform Hitler begins to rail against the Jews, and those that threaten the great country that is Germany. In the end this one man is forced to chose between art and power. Real history tells us what decision he made.
MAX is a fictional account of the early life of one of history's most evil men. But what I really liked about it is that it makes an attempt to get to heart of why people make the decisions that they do. Why did German nationalism lead to violence and genocide? Why do some people who are tested by pain survive and thrive, and others can be in the same place and become bitter? Why and what turned Hitler himself into a monster? Did he have a run in with a Jew that broke a promise or treated him like crud? All these questions come to mind and MAX tries to come to gripes with them.
What I also like about this movie is it has no hero, but allows you as the audience to be empathetic to these men. Maybe Hitler has a point. Maybe he has the right the feel put upon by the world. Why, when he plays by the rules, does he live in the gutter, while a fast talking, hard drinking, chain smoking, adulterer has a warm bed? It would make me mad too and doesn't jealousy make us do some pretty drastic things.
Writer/ first time Director Menno Meyjes (The Seige `Screenplay') has crafted a compelling and challenging story. The film makes a monster into a human being, not by praising him but by asking the one question we all ask, why? It doesn't begin to editorialize on what Hitler became, but presents us with a man who can make the right decision or walk down the wrong road. Of course we can never change the past, but we can try to find out where it all went wrong.
John Cusack does a marvelous job of painting the picture of a good guy with a great heart, but too many flaws. There is a great scene near the end of the film where his wife confronts him with his adultery. Max never once says he's sorry, and I don't think his wife expects him too. But she loves him too much to run away. Will Max change his ways, maybe?
Noah Taylor's Hitler has the perfect nuance. On one hand he's a bottled up ball of rage about to explode, on the other he's this wide-eyed dreamer looking for a shot. This is the hardest kind of part to play because the audience already comes in with the picture of what and who Hitler is, and not who he is at this moment. While he is an object of scorn, and rightly so. You can and must empathize with him, or the performance is lost. Taylor plays the right chords, and it works.
My favorite scene in the films comes as Hitler is giving a speech about the supremacy of the Aryan race and Germany in a local bar and nobody is paying attention to him. Except one kid. Later in the film Hitler is giving a similar speech to a room of about a hundred people and guess who's sitting there. That single kid has turned into hundreds. An idea, no matter how wrong and misguided, has power. It reminds me of those KKK rallies, they show on the local news. Sure hundreds show up to berate these people, but if one person hears and is mad at the world, they can be easily swayed. Makes you think, that maybe what we say and do can have an effect on the people around us.
MAX was my favorite film from last year and rightly so. It's bold, controversial, and asks a lot of questions, other films haven't. But mostly it's a human story about two men and their unlikely friendship. It's about striving to do what's right and it's about the power of art. It's about propaganda and politics--Hero's and madmen. MAX is a great film. ***** (Out of 5)",1072483200,13,5425,4.232401157184185
1848858,3,B00008K77D,"MAX begins in a giant art warehouse and creates a stark atmosphere of post-WWI darkness and chaos.  Max (John Cusack) is an artist who lost his arm in the war and he meets Hitler (Noah Taylor), depicted as a directionless artist.  The film bases some of its ideas on reality (Hitler was an aspiring artist, but before, not after the war), but one problem is we like and feel sympathy for this Hitler.
  Noah Taylor doesn't resemble the real Adolph in the least; in the film he's an artist who isn't anti-semitic and he's too damn likeable and cool looking with his army trenchcoat looking and acting more like a post-modern beatnik than a Nazi.  The Chaplin mustache isn't even here.  (Though the real one donned a mustache from before WWI).  He's coerced by the military into public speaking, and his speeches are interesting and comical. ""I paid 10 marks for this coat"" ""You paid too much"" ""That's what I told the Jew who sold it to me.""
  Nevertheless, the point is made: had Hitler been prompted in another direction than politics the Holocaust may well have been avoided. And Max, now an art dealer trying to induce Hitler to pursue his art rather than politics is the focal point to the alternate reality.  The ending is pretty predictable, and prompts one to ask, could something like this really have happened.
  John Cusack does a good performance and his relationship with Hitler is what holds our interest throughout the film.",1072224000,5,1437,4.704
1848859,1,B00008K77D,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, excluding movies with words like ""bikini"" and ""car wash"" in the titles (that is, movies which aren't trying to be good). Yes, it explores the connection between power and aesthetics... but not in an interesting or entertaining way. John Cusack's acting was absolutely horrible as this role is clearly far too ambitious for his limited range. Don't get me wrong--I loved him in ""High Fidelity,"" but he stunk up this film something awful. It takes what might conceivably be an interesting premise--that Hitler was, at heart, a frustrated artist who turned evil after he couldn't succeed at art but integrated art and aesthetic considerations into his rhetoric and other aspects of the reich--and makes it funnier and more ridiculous than any post-Dana Carvey-era SNL sketch. Everything about the film was unconvincing, from the young Hitler, to Cusack's missing arm... I was absolutely shocked to see the number of positive reviews this film had gotten. AVOID this movie. It is just bad, bad, bad. Take a cue from the fact that they are being sold used for under four dollars... SUCKS!

1848860,4,B00008K77D,"""Max"" is, no doubt, an important film.  The exploration of monstrosity through humanity, and how self-expression can be a gift and a blessing or a tool used to attain power is potent throughout the film.  Though it does tend to drag a little and the script is, at times, terribly unnatural, the acting and ending make up for most of these flaws.
Cusack is very good as Max Rothman, Jewish art dealer with an arm destroyed in his service during World War One.  As has been said, Taylor is excellent -- haunting and oddly sad, portraying a tortured young Hitler before he truly and completely believed his own drivel.  Though both actors come off as false or awkward during rare moments, this is hardly a fault of their own -- this is the fault of false or awkward screenwriting.
The other main fault, along with the screenwriting, has to do with a dragging mid-section, where everything seems very drawn out.  However, keep your interest focused here and you will be repaid with a stunning ending.
That is, in my opinion, the best part of the movie -- heavy on symbolism and real-life foreshadowing of the horror we all know is now bound to follow... Despite the fact that I knew throughout the film that Hitler was doomed to become an evil man and a source of unspeakable terror, It felt like I was holding out for another outcome.  This film tangles possibility in one's face, and then switches it with the cold reality that we've all learned in history books, and this switch makes for a sobering and emotional finale.
Anyway.  If you're open to a fresh (if fictionalized) look on this era of history and if you're willing to stand some bad dialogue and slow pacing to get to some great acting and an intesne ending, then this movie should not disappoint you.",1070064000,,1761,4.589171974522293
1848861,4,B00008K77D,"What you need to know about 'Max' is that it is an 'alternative history.'  Hitler's time as a struggling artist immediately after the 'Great War' is well documented.  So is his bitter regard for the Treaty of Versailles, signed in June 1919, in which the Germans took responsbility for that war and signed up to make major financial repatriations to its combatants.
'Max' puts us back into that timeframe and imagines how different the world might have been if Hitler's artistic abilities had been recognized.  The movie doubles the dilemma by personifying Hitler's art hopes in Max Rothman (John Cusack), a Jewish art dealer.  Meanwhile, various Army superiors take note of Hitler's latent talents as a polemicist, with a devleoping talent for stoking the resentements caused by Versailles (""a stab in the back"" sputters - literally - the 30-year-old Hitler).  We see the irony of Hitler developing his anti-Semitic bile, all the while being honestly befriended my Rothman.
""Inaccuracy"" is not the issue here.  This is ""Sliding Doors"" on a grand scale.  In the movie, Hitler is inches from giving up on politics in pursuit of his art.  Rothman is ready to commission a show for him.  It never comes to be.  That moment -the denouement - is classic cinema.
A couple of other points:
I understand realism, keeping with the times, etc...but Cusack smokes 25 - 30 cigarettes during the movie.  It's painful to watch.
Noah Taylor is the standout here as Hitler.  You may remember him as the young David Helfgott in ""Shine"" (especially his famous 'sweating scene' at the crucial piano recital).  You'd never know Taylor was an Australian.
I'm not sure how they pulled off Cusack's one-armed performance (a little CGI maybe?) but it's very well done.
Other than Taylor, the accents here are all over the map.  Cusack plays it straight, thank goodness, but we've got German-inflected English with all sorts of tinges popping out all over.  You've got Canadians, South Africans, Brits, Danes, Hungarians, and Scots in the leading roles.  At one point or another, you hear each of these homelands.",1069632000,5,2088,4.974063400576369
1848862,4,B00008K77D,"Speculative historical films and books can sometimes be entertaining, exploring the 'what ifs', the myriad of possibilities of how history 'could have been' if only that certain someone had turned left instead of right, or had not been murdered, or had not married, or had not invaded the USSR, or had not dropped the bomb, or... these kind of musings are only limited by the power of our imaginations - the possibilities are endless.
 ~Max~ is an interesting look into post WW1 Germany, the conditions of that country and a cursory look into a new art movements beginnings in response to the war. Modernism began after the Great War, and one of its important manifestations was German Expressionism. Anyone familiure with German Expressionism would agree that the work can be quite haunting. Anyone familiar with the Nazi/Hitler response to this art movement is aware that some of these artists ended up in concentration camps based solely on their 'modern' views of art. The Nazi campaign against 'decadent' forms of art began with propaganda, moved onto violence and gangster tactics, ending in a total ban on the movement in all its forms. The only form of art allowed in Germany during Hitler's reign was a kind of retro Greek/Roman classicism with a strange Aryan twist. In other words, this was Hitler's view on art and of course nothing else was permitted. This film explores the 'what ifs' of Hitler's attempted entry into the German art world.
Most people are aware that Adolph Hitler was an aspiring artist and ended up being a failed one. This film speculates on Hitler's artistic aspirations and actions straight after the war. In the film, Hitler (Noah Taylor) meets Max, (John Cusack) a Jewish art dealer, and we see him pathetically attempt to become an artist, ironically, however, motivated and financially supported by Max, who sees Hitler as having potential as a Futurist; we also see Hitler's rise in the National Socialist Workers Party. Noah's performance as the ranting Austrian is quite impressive, his acting in this film is nothing less then brilliant. In fact, it is worth seeing the film for this performance alone. Cusack also does a fine job as Max as we come away from the performance with great sympathy for the character.
Overall the film is well made and the subject matter is interesting -  well worth having a look at.",1068249600,2,2356,4.902255639097745

It's been a while since I saw it at the cinema, but I'm fairly sure that none of the events portrayed happened- I have a GCSE in history to prove it- so let's sit back, enjoy, spook ourselves with Taylor's frightening performance, bask in the warm glow of Cusack's benevolence, and wallow in the sheer perfection of acting in general, atmosphere and attention to (purely fictional, mark me) detail.
  My dad complains at ikkle details of films, and it spoils it for him.

1848864,3,B00008K77D,"Plodding, maybe. But innacurate?? Grow up. The movie is a fantasy which revels in its own speculation. A work of fiction is not responsible for historical accuracy, even one that purports to be historically accurate. It's only responsible for its own dramatic strength. To me, the drama has a tinge of the comic because it plays on what we already know about Hitler's future. It toys with the idea that he was on the fence about how to express himself and if this Max character played it differently, the 20th century could've turned out better. Cusack is successful in his portrayal of a man who's disturbed by Hitler but has no intimations as to what lengths he will eventually go. While on a sort of a double date, he says to the girls, ""Hitler has this thing about blood purity. We think...we hope it's just a metaphor."" And Noah Taylor is just brilliant, adding nuances and idiosyncrasies, fleshing out the character as a brilliant but pathetic wretch whose rage and resentment will eventually lead him to horrifying heights.

Of course the remarkable film can directly thank Noah Taylor and John Cusack for bringing its words to the screen with such subtle perfection. Your helpless not to be drawn in and bewitched from the very first frame.

Max follows a brief and delicate relationship between Max Rothman, a German Jewish ex-soldier and established art dealer, and his new ""discovery"" ex-soldier and artist-in-development Adolf Hitler.

Max (John Cusack) owns a trendy foo-foo forward thinking art gallery that should be located in Tribeca modern day. He's a postwar beatnik, a man looking for the future at a clip. Max is that gallery owner that would have seen the greatness of Dali and Picasso and inspire them to create even bolder works of surreal worlds; decades before they became chic.

He is a visionary, and a hodge podge of all the buzzwords we now take in as representing the avante gard in art commonplace. He believes art has the power to change the world...for the better.

Hitler, on the other hand, is a troubled ex-soldier stifled in his abilities to procreate on canvas.

Hitler meets Max and follows him as a lost puppy might. Angry at Max's bold blunt criticisms, yet drawn to draw into himself, as Max suggests, Hitler tries to morph his talents into sellable works that all can appreciate.

Max believes beneath, or by properly channeling the left-over anger from the ""Great War,"" Hitler can share his sadness - with compassion - so others will feel as they felt and avoid war again at all costs

Meanwhile at the hostel-like home Hitler's assigned to as an unemployed and poverty stricken civilian. Hitler lives among the lost; fellow German's without families who are unemployed embittered ex-military men that came home to nothing. The hierarchies of the ""home"" invite Adolf to join in their new government strategy rallies.

Oddly, and sadly, this small hovel of a man can grab the attention of the masses with his words. More so his passionate orchestrated delivery of his words; he is a performance artist.

His artful passion, that until now was oblivious in his artwork, blasts out over the crowd. Shudder. He fails as a painter but uses his ""art"" of diction to mesmerize the masses verbally. His eye for design will combine art and politics into a devastating concoction.

The whole thing still makes me chill with its realistic portrayal of what might have been and how hopelessly things fell into place for the monster.

Granted Max is a peek into the imaginary life of Hitler's formative years after the Great War but it is based on the truths we all know about the man. And, this makes it all the more terrifying and awe-inspiring. There's two ways to look at this film - debatable scenarios; if Hitler were a successful artist would an evil man have walked a different path? Or perhaps Hitler was always evil and nothing would have changed his horrid destiny.

The film is both eerie and remarkable.

Admittedly John Cusack is high on the coveted Emily Blunt's Mansteak Studmuffins and Slurpable Actors List. I mean he's about six foot two of pure man heroina Shepherd's pie of a lad; each layer more delicious than the last that reveals yet another hearty devourable bit of manyum. Smitten? You bet ya. But John's also one of our finest living actors.

Noah Taylor looks like he shares DNA with Keith Richards. I mean he's got that patented gawky British rockstar thing down. At first you're like Hitler? Noah -Shine - Taylor? Ah, but you too would be wrong 'em boyo! Trust this wealth of talent wrapped in a body that could sport leopard print pants and get away with it!

Menno Meyjes, who wrote and directed, is a very lucky man to have been smart enough to choose as he chose casting-wise. The entire stew of talents exudes the riveting dialog with a rare transporting affect. You leave the theater aghast and thankful the calendar still has the current date upon itthough if we only could turn back time and lock this vapid madman away in some psych ward were he obviously belonged",1488844800,,4228,4.779149519890261
