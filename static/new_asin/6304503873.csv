895491,5,6304503873,"Great movie, old fashioned who done it (rather who IS it tones) and except for the language at times I really liked it !",1407715200,,120,4.041666666666667
895492,5,6304503873,"I rated this movie 5 stars just because only two others rated it 5 stars. It was refreshing and well done. I presume Charlie Sheen's recent antics were rated and not the movie. The first 10 minutes are the best of the movie. it slows a touch and really would be a 4 star except for my above rationale. We seem to judge on goofy data and not on reality. A lot of Charley Sheen movies are just plain and simple good! So, why crucify the guy because he went goofy. Tiger woods was every bit as bad and due to political correctness we still are afraid to tell the truth. I rate Charley and Tiger a minus one but Shadow Conspiracy a 5 star.",1391990400,,635,4.088
895493,4,6304503873,"Great movie, if it would have been available on DVD I would have given it 5 stars. It amazes me how many great movies are passed by and not brought to DVD or those that are that should be remastered for Blu-ray. Charlie Sheen did a great jog along with a good supporting cast. And hey, Linda Hamilton when she was still cute :)",1385251200,,327,4.125
895494,3,6304503873,"SHADOW CONSPIRACY is an interesting film in that it recycles one of the oldest plots in the book, the subject of the recent release OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN.  The President (Sam Waterson) is at grave personal risk, and it is incumbent on a junior member of his staff (Charlie Sheen) to save him.  In SHADOW CONSPIRACY the threat is posed by members of the government, who believe that the luckless President is virtually insane and has to be removed ""for the good of America"" (shades of Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR, perhaps?)  Needless to say their bid is foiled by a last-minute burst of initiative from Sheen's hero.  The plot wends its predictable way with a few exciting action sequences, interspersed with risible dialogue: at one point we are informed that ""America is going to the dogs ...""  Sheen and journalist Linda Hamilton make a convincing action hero and heroine, while Gore Vidal pops up in another cameo role, this time as a Congressman forced to compromise his political beliefs to ensure personal survival.  The game of politics is a dirty one, to say the least.  Mildly entertaining if you like your films fast and furious.",1365379200,,1136,4.8549222797927465
895495,1,6304503873,"I am not pleased with this DVD because I didn't pay enough attention to all the details, it is not the correct region for USA, be sure and check region when ordering DVD's. It is a great movie I have it on tape, but wanted it on DVD.

MAKE SURE they are for Region 1, for USA.",1347235200,,276,3.8421052631578947
895496,2,6304503873,"You've seen it all before. Something is going on inside the government and people who are investigating it are getting killed.

Charlie Sheen stars as the Assistant to the President (Sam Waterston) who is being hunted by a determined Stephen Lang. Donald Sutherland plays Sheen's mentor and Linda Hamilton plays a reporter caught up in the plot. Theodore Bikel has a small part as the man who exposed the conspiracy.

There are several chase scenes which albeit are exciting, also seem incredible. Can you really chase someone through the luxury hotels in Washington shooting at them and pushing everyone out of the way?

It's a little funny to see Linda Hamilton running from the stern faced Stephen Lang who appears ""terminator"" like as a killing machine who ploys down everyone who gets in his way. Hamilton later confessed that she thought the film was ""mediocre"".

This was the last film for George Cosmatos (1941-2005) who made only 11 films between 1973 and 2004, including ""The Cassandra Crossing"" (1976), ""Rambo 2"" (1985), ""Cobra"" (1986) and ""Tombstone"" (1993).

It isn't so much that this is a bad film, it's just that it has been done many times and much better - ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962), ""Seven Days in May"" (1964), ""Soylent Green"" (1973), ""The Parallax View"" (1974), ""The Conversation"" (1974),  ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1975),  ""Blow Out"" (1981), ""No Way Out"" (1987),  and ""Conspiracy Theory"" (1997) to name a few.",1310428800,,1440,4.99581589958159
895497,5,6304503873,"This is a great movie if you like political intrigue, action and suspense, and if you're a fan of Donald Sutherland and Charlie Sheen.  This movie is almost more relevant today than it was when it was made.  Great cast and attention-getting, creative plot, with its fair share of twists and turns.  If you've never seen this movie, you should!",1218844800,,343,4.683333333333334
895538,3,6304503873,"This wasn't the best action/adventure flick, not by a long shot.  It did have a pretty good story line and some good action and fighting.  It lost me toward the end with the toy-helicopter flying around shooting real rounds and killing by-standers but always missing the real targets. This film would have got 4-stars from me but for that cheesy ending.",1191024000,,353,4.770491803278689
895539,4,6304503873,"This is a gem of a movie. Charlie Sheen does
the best that he is capable of. Donald Sutherland
is his usual brilliant self. It's about a shadow
government within the government that is trying
to run things. Sheen plays Billy Bishop,an advisor
to the president( ok,nobody can buy that)and he
accidently stumbles onto a shadow gov. That's when
the bodies start piling up. Despite Sheen,the story
itself is a really good political thriller.
That being said,save yourself some money and
buy this region 2 dvd from Amazon uk for less
than 1 pound!!!! About $3.00 US.

895540,2,6304503873,"The film starts off good.  Researchers are knocked off one by one by an assassin.  Who is this man?  Who does he work for?  The film then takes bad turn by not explaining more in detail what's going on.  The premise is there.  There are moments of suspense.  But, the execution just doesn't work.  Blame the story and screenplay for that!  By the end of this film, I wondered ""why""?  We don't get that answer and this film leaves a lot of loose ends.  Marginal thumbs down.",1148688000,,473,4.32183908045977
895541,5,6304503873,"Hello! I'm an angry customer! Stop putting reviews next items that have nothing to do with the item they are under. Everyone that sees this will think that the score for the film is bad, when in reality the music is gorgeous. Don't pay attention to the reviews; they only talk about the film. Oh right the ""VHS"" edition...stupid. The music is most certainly worth the money. If you like good action cues and a lot of them, and you like Bruce Broughton, well then don't hesitate to buy this score. The last score Broughton collaborated on with George P. Cosmatos was Tombstone, and if you like Tombstone then you will certainly like this. I think the fans of Bruce Broughton all rave about how Broughton does not get used in Hollywood nearly enough. All these media venture composers are taking over all the projects that are worth a damn. So pick this sucker up, good theme, beautiful action cues, more of the Broughton you want.",1116892800,,929,4.602409638554217
895542,3,6304503873,"A professor telephones a White House aide with a message. Soon his team is assassinated, and the bodies cleaned up. Remind you of ""Three Days of the Condor""? Powerful forces are at work! Then we learn that a newly re-elected President wants to make radical changes that would severely impact the economy. Later we see Bobby Bishop chased in public by a cold-blooded terminator. Believable? No, but plenty of exciting action. The President orders Bobby Bishop' protection, even if he doesn't want it. We know Bishop will survive, but who is behind the conspiracy? [Something in his manager's actions made me suspicious.] The death of the newspaper editor reminded me of that scene in ""Parallax View"". Would anyone have a soft-top in Washington DC? Bishop finds a paper with a list of names, and escapes with a newspaper reporter. When they return to the White House, the computer of a high official tells them more than they need to know. Their presence starts another chase after them, but they escape! They can evade the best surveillance in the Free World! What are they doing with our tax dollars? Bishop and the reporter see the conspirators secret meeting at a boat basin.

The escape into the Washington subway is unbelievable, but exciting action. The final scene recall ""Parallax View"" or the original ""Manchurian Candidate"", but with variations. And so the good guys win in the end with seconds to spare. [Could a toy helicopter fire bullets without being affected by the recoil?] Enjoy it as entertainment, not as a lecture. I laughed at a few of the scenes in this serious movie; did you?",1107734400,,1599,4.857142857142857
895543,3,6304503873,"THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY is a predictable, at times implausible, and often shoddily photographed thriller.  Yet for a passable 90 minutes, it's not too bad.

Charlie Sheen plays a special assistant to President Sam Waterson.  Professor Theodore Bikel warns Sheen that there is something definitely going on within the higher echelons of the government.  Soon Bikel bites the dust in Charlie's arms, and Sheen is off and running to find out who and what is going on.  He joins forces with an old flame and current pain in the butt Linda Hamilton, a reporter who did a story along these lines a year earlier.  Donald Sutherland plays Sheen's mentor and best friend, the Chief of Staff.  Ben Gazzarra plays another high-up, but he's given little to do.

The movie wanders a bit, but the finale in the Adams Hall is tight and tense, with an inventive form of fire power.

I think some reviewers were a little too hard on it.  It's passable and better than a lot of direct to video films.",1091664000,,980,4.645348837209302

895545,1,6304503873,"I decided to go ahead and give the film the 1 star it deserves, but anyone who is an afficianado of bad cinema will love this movie.  The talented  cast never seems to realize what unholy crap they're in.  And the story  gets steadily more unbelievable until the final, bust-a-gut climax.  Personally, I'm looking forward to this being released on DVD...",967075200,,354,4.737704918032787

At any moment, I feel she's gonna overact a long monologue about the end of the world when the machines take over. The best part of this movie is probably Stephen Lang's portrayal of the bad guy. There's always a conspiracy people...but as long as there's popcorn, it'll be OK.",1470873600,,440,4.653846153846154
