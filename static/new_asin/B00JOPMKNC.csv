6382118,5,B00JOPMKNC,"SEEN ANY good cop shows lately? How about a Western? A&Es Longmire combines the best of both genres and, now that the Blu-rays of Seasons 1 and 2 are available in a double-season set, its a great way to binge-watch.

The series is based on Craig Johnsons bestselling novels set in Absaroka County, Wyoming. (Shades of Shane, a personal favorite.) Sheriff Walt Longmire, played by Australian Robert Taylor, knows his way around his county and his people, both in town and on the Reservation. Capable of great violence as well as great sensitivity, hes moved to tears in the pilot when he has to notify a woman that her husband has been killed. Hes also able to hold calling for medical help on a suspect whos been shot until he gets the information he needs.

Its Western justice  and Walt Longmire knows who deserves it. Point of fact, hes not fond of litter either.

Taylor is surrounded by excellent co-stars including Katee Sackhoff (Deputy Vic Moretti, a five-year homicide detective relocated to Wyoming), Lou Diamond Phillips (Henry Standing Bear, local bar owner and Longmires pal of 30-plus years), Zahn McClarnon (Officer Mathias of the Reservation police and definitely not a friend) and Bailey Chase (Deputy Branch Connally, son of local judge, Barlow Connally, played Gerald McRaney).

Branch is still wet behind the ears, as they say out west, but eager to challenge Longmire in the upcoming election for sheriff. Branch believes Walts ways are too old fashioned; he wants the department to use more modern tech, such as updated computers instead of relying on instinct, experience and folklore. But its A Martinez as the well-to-do and politically powerful Jacob Nighthorse who is Walts greatest enemy, supporting Branch in the election and thwarting the sheriff any way he can.

The election is one of the running stories of the series along with the mystery surrounding the death of Longmires wife. We learn shes been gone for more than a year in the pilot, but, like a ghost, she lingers into the third season. The sheriff is just getting back into action in the first episode, investigating a murder. Abductions, drug smuggling and other crimes are explored throughout the two seasons, the same kind of problems  including cultural bias  wed find in Chicago, L.A. or New York City.

New Mexico substitutes for Absaroka County and the cinematography is stunning, especially on 1080p Blu-ray. Color, depth, and detail are near-movie quality. But its not just the scenery that sets the tone, its the weather, too. Adam Barley, who plays The Ferg, another Longmire deputy, tells us its not unusual to be filming in knee-deep snow one day and in 90-degree heat the next in the The Cameras Eye: Realizing the World of Longmire. If it snows or hails, they keep filming. In one scene, we see Vic using a generator and a hair dryer to thaw snow, looking for evidence at a crime scene. Filmmakers also had to ""chase the snow"" to maintain continuity when weather changed.

Elements of the setting were discussed in the initial pitch, executive producer Greer Shephard (The Closer, Major Crimes, Nip/Tuck) tells us. You have this incredibly lush, grand, beautiful landscape that for many people is romantic and very, very peaceful. And yet it is riddled with danger and violence.

Sound comes to us through a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. Dialogue, effects and score come through clearly, although we don't have the immersive experience of surround-sound.

Bonus features are good and detailed for Season 1 and 2  although its startling to hear that Australian accent come out of Walt Longmire. In the Longmire Justice: Exploring the Cowboy Detective feature, executive producer/writer Hunt Baldwin (The Closer) says they wanted to put something on the air [a Western] that people haven't seen in a long time.

Season 2 has extended versions of Sound & Fury, a Western noir in the spirit of Blood Simple, and Election Day, the most emotional of the episodes, with intros by Baldwin and Shephard. We also have the Testing Courage: The Storm Defines the Man feature about what it means to be a hero in Longmires world.

Barley says the appeal of detective shows is that viewers long to put themselves in the role of solving the mystery and bringing criminals to justice. And what better place to do this than in the contemporary West, with an iconic American hero?

Dont miss it, pardner, this series comes highly recommended.   Kay Reynolds",1402704000,16,4451,4.93574297188755
6382119,5,B00JOPMKNC,Excellent series with great characters who all seem to have big secrets in their past. Always a great story and a great cast.,1399420800,6,125,4.478260869565218
6382120,5,B00JOPMKNC,"Can't wait for season 3 to start. If you need a jester & lots of explosions, this is not the show for you. It's slow & careful. It unfolds a story a little at a time and has interesting character development. Paced more similar to True Detectives, except usually a crime gets solved every episode, but the storytelling is similar, not fast, exploding or crazy, just solid, interesting and well written. It's a bit of a western/drama/cop series. I love the actor that plays Longmire & Katee Sackhoff as a deputy, as well as Lou Diamond Phillips as Longmire's longtime friend & native American bartender for the local bar.",1398816000,16,620,4.697247706422019
6382121,5,B00JOPMKNC,"Love this show. Was disappointed when they released the first two seasons on DVD with no option for Bluray -- especially considering the backdrop of the show being so beautiful. There is simply no comparison between DVD and Bluray. Now that it's coming on Bluray, I'll definitely add this show to my collection.

Updated:
I just want to update this review since I have finally had an opportunity to sit down and watch both seasons again. What can I say. I'm not disappointed at all. While I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD versions, I know I was extremely pleased with the High-Def quality of this Bluray release. It was very much on par with the big name movies that are released on Bluray. Seeing loose strands of hair and pours on faces in closeups, you just can't beat that kind of quality at the present moment.

From what I understand, the special features and all are exactly the same as they were on the DVD version, but I enjoyed watching the extended episodes and the lengthy behind the scenes features anyway.

I can only hope that from now on, they'll continue offering Bluray releases for each new season. So looking forward to Season 3.",1398729600,23,1159,4.5893719806763285
6382122,5,B00JOPMKNC,"It is one of my favorite series ever, although it could use more episodes. Season 3 is just around the corner so this will be an opportunity to do a LONGMIRE marathon to get ready. I'm glad I held out and did not get the non-blu ray dvd's when they came out.",1398470400,8,258,3.980769230769231

6382124,1,B00JOPMKNC,"I just binge-watched all 5 season of Longmire while sick at home.  I want to warn everyone off of this show.  The Walt Longmire books are well-written and as a westerner I really enjoy novels based here.  The TV show amps up the books; there is much more drama and angst, which I didn't need but was fine.  BUT the creators/writers have done something which I despise in an ongoing book series or TV show; they continually end on cliffhangers.  Sometimes a story arc requires more than one show to complete and that can be appropriate,  But I don't remember a single episode that didn't end with a cliffhanger and that includes the end of each season, which I consider despicable.  (And that includes the last season, season 5.  It's still not completely clear if a season 6 will be made.  This is just cheap

If the show had been written without the perpetual cliffhangers, I would have given it a rating of 4 stars.  The actors are very good and the plots are interesting.  It does annoy me A LOT that the producers think that it is OK to film a show that takes place in Wyoming actually in New Mexico; the landscape and plants and the sky are all very different.

As it is, I would not recommend watching this series unless and until it is given real a real ending where an ending is called for.",1476144000,,1298,4.380753138075314

Glad that season 4 is now out on that other big streaming video provider (Netflix).
I had hoped the Amazon would pick up the Longmire series' rights once the morons over at A&E cancelled the show.

6382139,5,B00JOPMKNC,"If you have ever lived in a small mountain town in the modern American West, or even spent several weeks in one, you know just what a masterpiece of authenticity this show is. Every character, hero or villain (and thankfully, each character is both, in varying measures), is given his or her due. No condescending stereotypes based on sex, race, color or national origin, either. Greed, grief, pride, joy, loyalty, corruption, courage, integrity, anger, envy, love, and loss know no jurisdictional boundaries. Like all the best literature, film and television, this show is first and last about families, of both the blood and improvised types, with their dizzying mix of love and revulsion, mutual disdain and heartwarming solidarity. Watch the first episode of Season 2, ""Unquiet Mind,""  and go slack-jawed with wonder that less than an hour of television can hold its own with any Oscar-caliber movies ever made in the law enforcement or Western genres. The Blu Ray transfer is first-rate. Season 4, promised by Netflix, cannot come soon enough!",1427587200,2,1048,5.128654970760234

6382142,5,B00JOPMKNC,"I don't have cable living out in the country, so I ordered this series based on reviews. Longmire is a very entertaining series. Excellent episode plots with underlying subplots connecting them together, with decent character development for the main characters, and dynamics between them. Walt Longmire is the quintessential tough as nails guy, but with a caring, tender side you would want to see in your sheriff. Set in modern times, his character is In the tradition as those portrayed by John Wanye, Clint Eastwood, and Tom Selleck. All of the characters grow on you. I liked this series enough to pre-order the 3rd season. I was disappointed to hear that A&E was cancelling the series, but then elated that Netflix has picked it up for a fourth.",1425340800,,751,4.875

6382158,5,B00JOPMKNC,"The series Longmire, released a couple of months ago on Blu-ray by Warner Archives stars Robert Taylor as Walt Longmire, a sheriff who patrols areas of woodland and desert, ofice-swept mountains and sun-dried stretches of sand, across Wyoming highways of wide sky and little traffic.

Warner Archives Blu-ray collection of Seasons One and Two of the series looks superb. The evocative location photography is actually filmed in places such as Santa Fe and Eagle Nest. But I would not have known that if I hadnt researched the production. Maybe people who live in Wyoming may notice, but the show employs a consistent ambiance of place, whether in the sweltering sun with little shade in sight, or the wooded mountain slopes covered with snow and freezing icy streams.

The images on the Blu-ray are sharp, and beautiful when Walt and the people who work for or against him hike on out of the town limits.

Youre as likely to run into a bison staring you down on the long stretch of highway as you are to run into a semi-trailer truck hurtling goods to some town or city faraway.

There's lots more on my new Riding Shotgun column:  A&E Murdered Longmire, But Walt Rides Tall on Blu-ray

6382191,5,B00JOPMKNC,"This series just gets better as it goes.  I will be ordering season 3 when available.  The series is only thinly related to Craig Johnson's books, which I also have.  I have not read them all yet.",1406937600,,196,4.243243243243243

6382196,5,B00JOPMKNC,My husband and I rarely agree on a movie or series to watch except Longmire! We have given as gift a few times as well.,1405209600,,119,3.8
6382197,5,B00JOPMKNC,"I usually don't like westerns, but this series is awesome.  The stories closely follow the author Craig Johnson's books (which I had to read after watching Longmire).  You can just see how hard it would be to police a rural county like The one in Longmire.  The people and integrations are just as complex as any my family and distant relations get into.  Yea and keep them coming.",1405209600,,381,4.5588235294117645
6382198,5,B00JOPMKNC,"I am so glad that Longmire is available in Blu-ray. This program is the most visually beautiful series on tv. I am a huge fan; love the interaction of the main characters; even the ""bad guys"" are interesting. It's great to watch a program that is NOT shot in New York or LA. Can't wait for season 3 to be released!",1405123200,,314,4.163934426229508
6382199,4,B00JOPMKNC,"Longmire Fan.  If you like the western genre, it's hard NOT to enjoy Longmire.  In the opener for Season Three, somebody tells Sheriff Longmire to call 911.  Speaking to himself he says, ""I am 911.""  A good summation for the entire Longmire series!  The fictional setting is Absaroka County, Wyoming.  You would not want to live there; high crime rate!  Lou Diamond Phillips plays Henry Standing Bear, the sheriff's closest friend.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the Native American influence in the series storylines.  There's something that you admire about Sheriff Longmire.  He's a no-nonsense type of guy that believes in justice for all.  He doesn't look for a good brawl, but he does not shy away if it comes calling.  When the story opens, you find that the Sheriff lost his wife.  The circumstances regarding her loss unfold during the course of the series.  Long story short (punded intended), Longmire is worth a watch for anybody that loves a good modern western ... and for many others as well!  By the way, the bluray quslity is great!",1405123200,6,1045,4.824858757062147

6382208,5,B00JOPMKNC,"We have watched this series from the beginning and never miss it.  The Blu-ray DVD's of the first two seasons are great to have so we can go back to prior episodes during the off-season.  I had not read the books when we started watching the tv series, so don't be discouraged from watching if you don't read the books.  However, I love the series so much, I have now read many of the books and love them as well.  The cast is perfect, script, delivery, photography, everything.",1404086400,4,478,4.3977272727272725
6382209,5,B00JOPMKNC,"Longmire is a throwback similar to the Lous Lamor stories of the crossing of lines between good and evil, bad or worse, and the blurring of black and white circumstance to shades of gray.  But with all of that, there is one thing you CAN count on being constant.....
Loyalty!...
And the dedication to something greater than ones self.
What happened to those days?
At least they are preserved for posterity in this wonderful series.
Hope it continues for years.

Unfortunately, we finished through about the 4th season before they began using the Lord's name in vain, so we stopped watching it. Good storyline, don't know why they had to defile the Lord so far along into the story.",1522454400,,301,4.592592592592593
