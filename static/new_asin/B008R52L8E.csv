5178805,4,B008R52L8E,"Just sending this out even though I have not played it yet. I have not had the time to view it but with so many family type movies, and especially the never ending story  episode, at such a great price, I do not see how it could go wrong. Decent movies at reasonable prices are hard to find and I am glad I bought it. It should probably get 5 stars but I do not want to do that without viewing it. Past movies were always great and expect the same from this one.",1395705600,,462,3.9148936170212765

5178809,4,B008R52L8E,"I'm glad I saw this product here on Amazon as it's a value pack of 8 family-friendly movies. Some are more appropriate for older children, possibly ages 10 and up, while others are OK for younger children ages 6 and up. Due to some scary images in many of these movies, I'm not sure they are appropriate for the under six age group.
Here's a listing of the movies:

The Neverending Story III: Escape from Fantasia
A young boy named Bastian wishes himself into Fantasia which is a storybook world full of magical creatures. This movie is not, in my opinion, as good as Neverending Story I, but it is OK for children.
This movie is rated G and runs 96 minutes. There are many fantasy sequences in this with some images that may be too scary for younger children.

Mysterious Museum
Two siblings, a boy and girl, find themselves going on an adventure when they get sucked into a museum painting that takes them to the 17th century.
This movie is rated PG for brief language and runs 90 minutes.

The Fairy King of Ar
This is an interesting movie which centers on a family where the two children, Kyle and Evie Preston find their grandmother's country property  which is adjacent to an old mine may lead to a doorway between the human world and the fairy realm. Their discovery just might help their father who is terminally ill. There are some scary images of goblin-like creatures in this movie which might be too scary for the under six age group.
The movie is rated Not Rated, and runs 91 minutes.

Nico the Unicorn
This is a wonderful tale of a young boy with a physical handicap who discovers the power of friendship and loyalty when his pony gives birth to a unicorn. There are some kissing scenes here involving the boy's mom and her policeman boyfriend but nothing overly graphic. There is also a tense scene involving a mountain lion attacking the pony.
The movie is Not Rated and runs 95 minutes.

The Little Unicorn
Similar in a plot to ""Nico the Unicorn"", a young girl's horse births a unicorn and she must find a way of keeping her unicorn safe from the prying eyes of the townspeople. This movie is Not Rated and runs 81 minutes.

The Phoenix and the Carpet
A tale of fantasy and magic, it centers on four children who inherit an ancient talking bird after it hatches from an egg, having been in the egg for 2,000 years. This movie has some language issues, containing mild profanity and is Not Rated, and runs for 94 minutes.

The Magic Door
A British production, the movie is notable (for me at least) because it features Giles the librarian from the iconic TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Oh, and Patsy Kensit. The story features two children who are finding it difficult to cope with the fact that their father has a new wife (the children's mother died some time ago). They run off and take up with a troll who unlike the stories of old, is not a malevolent creature. There is also a plot involving fairies, a magical door to the fairy realm, and a wicked witch. There are some scary images in this one, featuring fairies with eerie-glowing eyes, fangs, and snarls, so this might not be appropriate for young children.
The movie is Not Rated, but does involve a child saying the word ""s***"", and runs 90 minutes.

The Last Leprechaun
This is a bit of a creepy story. Siblings Ethel and Tommy find out their father's new fiancee is actually a malevolent spirit, and the only way to get rid of her is with the help of a leprechaun.
The movie is Not Rated, and runs 93 minutes.

Overall, the films are a mixed bag. Some are much better productions than others, but for the price and with some careful screening on the part of adults, I think many of them are good (not great) family-friendly movies.",1365897600,18,3715,4.482248520710059
