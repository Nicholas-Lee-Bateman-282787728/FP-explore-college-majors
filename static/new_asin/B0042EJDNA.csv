4249482,3,B0042EJDNA,"I had mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand, it's got a few flashes or genuine creativity. At one point, the movie replaces an otherwise boring narration about a girl's history with Barbie doll animation. Still, I never really bought Duncan's (Brendan Patricks) character or his situation. All guys have had trouble finding the love of their life, but his life doesn't seem particularly bad or abnormal. In fact, he seems to go overboard in otherwise somewhat normal situations. The girls themselves are also fairly unlikeable characters. Some of them are good looking, but have fairly superficial personalities. I guess they're partially a victim of the movie's having to go through so many girlfriends in such a short time.",1315094400,,736,5.090909090909091

4249484,4,B0042EJDNA,"""My Last Five Girlfriends"" takes that most reliable of genres, the romantic comedy, and elevates it to amazing heights of intelligence and creativity. For this particular story, love is not a state of mind but rather an analytical process, one that can be so confusing, complicated, and heartbreaking that it ultimately may not be worth the time and effort. Duncan (Brendan Patricks), a British structural engineer, is at a point where he's desperate to know how love is supposed to work, his last five relationships having ended rather unpleasantly. What went wrong? If he had done something differently, would that have changed any of the outcomes? He narrates the film not as a reflection but more as a deconstruction, as if to say that, although he has already participated in the events, he's no closer to understanding them, and in all likelihood never will be.

That doesn't make this movie a tragedy, although it does imply, with great frustration, that no matter how many times one has loved and lost, there's no insight one can apply to a new relationship after the previous relationship's failure. Each of Duncan's girlfriends is unique both in back story and personality, which may account for this problem. Then again, it's quite possible that, for all the analyzing he does, Duncan is remarkably imperceptive. How else to explain his failure to find the right woman five time in a row?

Adapted from Alain de Botton's novel ""Essays in Love,"" this movie is an astonishing achievement in tone and illustration, the ups and downs of Duncan's love life cleverly displayed through a whimsical series of symbols, visual gags, imagined scenarios, and cinematic tricks that in any other film might have seemed obvious. As he flies home, for example, he meets girlfriend No. 1, Wendy (Kelly Adams), whose life story gets the visual treatment when the cabin magically morphs into a funhouse ride; she and Duncan glide past scenes where crudely dressed Barbie dolls stand in place of more lifelike animatronic figures. This is, we quickly discover, a preview of coming attractions, Duncan eventually wandering into an imaginary carnival where rides represent his subsequent relationships. One of this is a rather twisted-looking roller coaster, the track navigated not by a traditional train, but by a line of red high-heeled shoes.

Other flights of fancy weave in and out of the story, the funniest being a conversation between Duncan and his newest girlfriend's plush elephant, brought to life via puppetry. We also see an advertisement similar to a [...] testimonial, camped up by religious imagery and a nostalgic 1950s graininess. Writer/director Julian Kemp handles this not merely as a gaudy display of imagination, but as a thoughtful examination of the madhouse that relationships can be - sometimes they're a lot of fun, but they can also be quite taxing, especially when it seems no one knows what they're looking for. Many go into a relationship thinking they know exactly what they want, only to realize that the people they envision are usually never the people they actually are.

Duncan's first four relationships are fairly inconsequential, despite giving Duncan quite a bit to think about. It's the fifth relationship with Gemma (Naomie Harris) that we're meant to focus on, not only because it's the longest lasting one of the story, but also because it's the most compelling in exemplifying Duncan's complicated situation. Gemma is a sweet girl - attractive, outgoing, intelligent - but as time goes on, Duncan begins to wonder if everything she says is really just a coded language. Eventually, he finds that she doesn't do well with happy situations; she's much better off with the idea of happy situations and the memories they bring. This relationship is symbolized by a carnival drop tower that lifts Duncan to stratospheric heights and has no visible top. Imagine what would happen if the car were to fall.

I've seen a lot of romantic comedies, and I've generally been harsh on them. They're either formulaic, unrealistic, about characters that have no truth to them, or as in most cases, all of the above. The greatness of ""My Last Five Girlfriends"" is not only that it's a triumph of imagination and style, but also that it tells a charming story with engaging characters. The otherworldly imagery works with the story, not in spite of it - it's a vision of pure fantasy, and yet it's never so outrageous that we fail to notice the emotions or the themes, both of which are grounded firmly in reality. I think the future of romantic comedies depends more on movies like this and less on movies like ""My Life in Ruins,"" ""27 Dresses,"" ""Leap Year,"" and ""The Back-Up Plan,"" all fantasies in the worst possible sense.",1276214400,8,4745,4.986111111111111

4249486,5,B0042EJDNA,I saw this film in New York at the Tribeca Film Festival and was completely surprised. I was expecting a chick-flick and this is so totally not that! It's told from the dude's point of view and at times is almost a documentary. My girlfriend broke a rib laughing during the red shoe sequence. The hero Duncan goes through his last 5 (yes 5) girlfriends and looks at where it all went wrong. This is a great comedy and date film with some bizarre visual moments that stay with you long after the film has finished. My girlfriend seemed to like me more after the film - ha ha.,1273017600,4,574,4.275229357798165

8413464,5,B0042EJDNA,"enjoyed - My Last Five Girlfriends traces the romantic journey of thirtysomething bachelor Duncan. As the film opens, the despondent Duncan is apparently preparing to take his own life, but not before taking the time to send a message to the last five women he dated. Taking the form of a whirlwind tour through ""Duncan World,"" the film is a comedic exploration of his failed relationships. First there's Wendy (Kelly Adams), who can't get over her ex. Then Duncan adapts a variety of different personalities in a failed effort to charm Olive (Jane March of The Lover). His relationship with Rhona (Ccile Cassel) ends badly because he can't appreciate her sense of style. Things go more smoothly with Natalie (Edith Bukovics), but he pulls back when he begins to feel that they're moving too fast. After their breakup, he pursues Natalie's friend Gemma (Naomie Harris of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels). With Gemma, Duncan feels that he's learned from his past mistakes and found a potentially lasting and true love, but she seems reluctant to commit.",1460678400,,1057,4.977401129943503

It was so gimmicky and was quite vapid, I guess if you like cheesy effects and a loser guy talking about his ex-girlfriends, this would be a great movie for you.

8413470,3,B0042EJDNA,"Three stars because Brendan Patricks is cute; this character could easily be EXTREMELY annoying, but he never is, not for one second.

The theme park gimmick is sort of clever, and the red boots are hilarious. I laughed out loud. Otherwise this movie is mostly tiresome and occasionally irritating - especially the WAY-TOO-LONG final section with Naomie Harris.

But then I'm gay; I like women, and I admire them a lot, but the notion of being attracted to them sexually is weird. I can usually get around that hurdle when watching straight movies, but for some reason I couldn't with this one.",1392163200,,594,4.813725490196078
8413471,4,B0042EJDNA,"This is the tale of a British dude (Brendan Patricks) who recalls his last five girlfriends and blames them for things not working out and telling his bitter tale to the audience. However, as you flashback to the tales you begin to see that at least part of the overall blame is upon him, especially in regards to his insecurities about love. The last girlfriend which is analyzed for the longest part of the film is more ""her fault"" if you want to take sides and it's a pretty obvious move of self sabotage on her part.

The tale is a bit slow but it picks up. There are some interesting interrupt moments as people and things in his fantasy ""speak to him"" and give him advice. Usually bad advice when they aren't making him feeling insecure about his chances of making things work. There were some interesting theories and focuses. Look for ""Romantic Terrorism"" and ""The Male Guide To Sulking""

If I was involved with some of his exes I'd shoot myself dead. Really. Others were just fine and even lovable characters so they did a good job not making them all unlikely prospects. His last girlfriend, Gemma, was played by Naomi Harris and for the movie buffs one of his earlier irritating girlfriends, Olive, was played by Jane March (""The Lover"" ""Color of the Night"" and 2010 ""Clash of the Titans"").

Questions love and the feelings that go with it. He questions whether love is real and not just a stomach ache. There are some good points that romantic love is a learned ritual and not something you see in all cultures over the world though it is certainly the most popular as it takes human beings to a higher level. And, like a lot of broken heart love tales, it ends on a hopeful note of him meeting somebody new (we just see her from behind) and then immediately ending.

Based on pop-philosopher Alain De Botton's book, Essays In Love (U.S. title On Love).

8413472,4,B0042EJDNA,"My friend and I picked this movie because it looked quirky and a little different.  Neither one of us had heard of it but we liked the trailer.  One of the things I like about British movies, generally, is that the actors don't all look like models, they look like real people.  That was true about this movie but, and I hate to say this because it reveals how truly shallow I am, the male lead still needs to be reasonably attractive.  In this case, Brendan Patrick, who played the feckless protagonist who has been unlucky at love, looked mostly ok but occasionally extremely unappealing.  Depressed over his lack of success with women, he decides to kill himself (not a spoiler, it happens at the beginning as the movie is mostly flashback) and reviews his last five girlfriends as part of his justification for this act.  I have to say that none of the five women seemed like nice people and I wouldn't have wanted any of them as friends, he was better off without them.  Or maybe this was just the male perspective?  At any rate, the film had a funny running theme where he was exploring an amusement park dedicated to his life; it was a very clever idea and reasonably well carried out.  However, since he was a hang dog bummer kind of guy and none of the women were that nice, the movie resembled, for me, a bunch of skits strung together, because I didn't really care what happened.  And of course it had a nice rom com ending, which shouldn't be a spoiler because it was billed as a rom com.",1317081600,,1500,4.4021739130434785
