8231246,1,B000096JHT,"Ray Pointer's Inkwell Images DVDs are the most overpriced animation DVDs on the internet. These DVDs are terrible because A) Pointer did not press these on professional DVDs but lousy and cheap DVD-Rs and the quality suffers greatly. B) Pointer spared little expense when putting these abominations together, using the worst of the worst stock music and, on the cartoons themselves, music stolen straight from old Van Beuren cartoons (which Ray hates), people complain about the sounds added to the much-better ""Cartoon Crazys"" DVDs, well at least those were sound cartoons to begin with, we are dealing with SILENT films here and they should have been left alone. C) Pointer re-titled and therefore ruined the films by adding his own copyright, something I would expect Alois Dettlaff to do not Pointer a self proffessed expert on this subject matter. And lastly D) We really DID NOT need Pointer yelling and jamming ""history"" down our throats after each cartoon, let the toons speak for themselves. In closing, Mr. Pointer knows nothing about DVD production and in the end all these ""DVDs"" are good for are being coasters for your favorite soft drink. Let's hope someone who is not in this to make a quick buck, and who actually cares about these cartoons does them right, CALLING STEVE STANCHFIELD, CALLING DR. THOMAS R. REICH!!!!!.",1411603200,2,1335,5.018018018018018
8231247,5,B000096JHT,I highly recommend this DVD set to all fans of the Fleischer studios and to fans of silent cinema.  This DVD set contains Ko-Ko the Clowns earliest cartoons from a time before he was just a costar in Betty Boop's shorts.  These shorts are also interesting because they are a mixture of live action and animation.  The shorts have an excellent background score done by animation legend Winston Sharples.  This DVD set also contains lots of info on the Fleischer Brothers and on the actual shorts themselves.  The picture quality is also very good.,1114387200,,546,4.76595744680851
