7894576,3,6305731977,"It was Ok, But I do like the Sylvia Kistal Version myself, the first Emmanuelle is what started it, beautiful photography, well good story, and also the music. This version is more like a Emmanuelle Wanta Be. Yes she does have a beautiful body, but the story just lost it. If you want to see the Original Emmmanuelle 1, and 2, and 3 with Sylvia Kistal, I would say those are the best in the series..",1247097600,3,399,4.2631578947368425
7894577,1,6305731977,"This is a really stupid film.  The acting is almost as poor as the writing.  If what you want to see is sex, rent something else.  Not only is there nothing interesting in this film, there is nothing very sexy in it either.

The plot actually had possibilities, but they were not realized.  It is about women being sold into slavery in South America.  That actually happens.  Both men and women are enslaved in the jungles of Brazil far from civilization.  They are slave laborers and sex slaves.  Movies can and should be made about them, and something should be done to prevent the practice.

But this film didn't show any of that beyond a dopy slave auction.

The film focused on Emmanuelle's stupid amnesia.  She's trying to remember who she is.  Her amnesia was caused by her traumatic experiences in the jungle, sold into slavery, almost.  Nothing happened to her there.  Nothing traumatic occurred.  The whole concept was just soooo stupid.  They skimmed the surface of slavery, not getting into it.  It is a gutless and foolish flick.

Really the whole point of it all was to put models on film so you can see their bodies for a few minutes.  So what.  The plot and the acting were both insultingly stupid.

I wanted to give the whole movie a chance so I let it play til the end.  But in order to get through it I had to do something else at the same time.  I couldn't waste over an hour doing nothing but watch this idiocy.",1134259200,8,1432,4.44015444015444
7894578,2,6305731977,"Emmanuelle 6, stars (I use that word loosely) Natalie Uher, a former Playboy Playmate of the Month in September 1984 (German magazine edition). Maybe I should say Natalie Uher has the lead role. Yeah that's better. Now does Natalie take off her clothes? Is there a terrorist in Iraq? Not only does she romp around in the buff but several other well endowed ladies do as well. No that's not the bad part. That's the good part, the only good part.

Duh Plot

I'd say they borrowed the plot from The Bourne Idenity except Emmanulle 6 came first. It's seems after being lost in Amazonia (yes Amazonia)for a couple weeks Emmanuelle mysteriously turns up and guess what? She has amnesia. It seems Emmanulle, a model and about four other lovely lasses were in Amazonia for a swim suit shoot. I can see why they'd go to Amazonia, can't you? Maybe next year they'd go to Antartica.

Emmanuelle and her cadre board a large passenger ship for a journey up the Amazon River to wherever the hell they're going have their shoot. Emmanuelle and the other girls each has a stateroom on a portion of the ship where men are supposed to be forbidden but apparently not the First Mate who enters her stateroom and tries to rape Emmanulle. He almost succeeds but he's suddenly knocked silly by the scantily clad Indian girl who was hiding in Emmanulle's large trunk. Oh didn't I tell you about her?

She escaped from a slave market and hid from her pursuers in the trunk which was then carried on board. Makes sense right? Well stay tuned wait til I tell you what Emmanuelle does to get even with the First Mate who tried to rape her. Does she report him to the Captain? No! Does she go after him with a gun? No! She knows he's following her so she goes into the depths of the ship, the boiler room and seduces one of the sweaty, bare chested, muscular workers. Boy she showed him!

Well, this is getting too long so here's a condensed version of the rest. It seems the First Mate in conjunction with others has a plan to capture the models and sell them into slavery (as sex toys), so he leads the girls and their official protector (?) into captivity at the ranch of the mate's partner. Now, the Indian girl, who was following the party, knows what's going on, since she's been down this road, so she goes and get's some Indian friends to help.

It's now the night of the big Sex Slave Sale of the Year and four or five seedy alleged bidders are ogling over the goodies, while the auctioneer, who reminds me of Willie Nelson, is fawning over some of the fully naked babes.

If I remember right the auction is being held in a building and the rescuers (the Amazon Indians) are outside with their poison darts. Here's where I learned something. I didn't know poison darts could go through walls and windows, did you? Well, they not only did, but these guys were good, they didn't miss a shot and in all the excitement Emmanuelle's little Indian friend leads her out.

There is a little more but I'm sure you get the picture.

Duh Conclusion

As I said earlier, the flick's only redeeming quality was a substantial supply of T&A, so if that's all you want, you get that, in spades and it's obvious that that's all the producers wanted to deliver and they did.

However, if you, like me, expect your sexual romps to make sense, to have a modicum of a story, I would pass on this farce.

Final Rating; 1 1/2 stars

Please Note: Though this is not true pornography and there is no discernable swearing, it does contain lots of nudity (bless them) and suggestive scenes, therefore I cannot recommend this movie for children under thirty.",1106956800,26,3611,4.4779299847792995
7894579,2,6305731977,"I won't repeat here the same things that other reviewers have said, as I totally agree with them.
This movie has several boring parts, and the main character (Emmanuelle) is wasted all way long.
Everybody watching this movie could expect more real action with Emmanuelle, but she only plays some nude shots, and that's all. Disappointing!
The worse of this film, is its ending. When you see Emmanuelle fingering on the bare dirt, you would expect her to remember the last part of her journey, but then the credits start to roll!! So, you wonder, what really happened to her in the jungle?? What is this movie about? What kind of ending is that??
All the movie is about Emmanuelle remembering her (forgotten) traumatic experience in the Amazon jungle. But it seems you'll miss the best part since she doesn't finish recalling her memories, so this movie is a monumental fraud.
What really happened to Emmanuelle in the jungle? We'll never know... this really sucks!",1081987200,7,964,4.848484848484849
7894580,4,6305731977,"Natalie Uher is nothing but absolutely stunning in this late 80s erotic classic.
The story line is OK but there is obvious direction to show naked women, but what else would you expect?
Natalie Uher is stunning and although there are quite a few scenes in which Uher bares it all, the film could have scored 5/5 by showing a little more, in my opinion.
If your reason for watching this film is solely for viewing the scantily-clad 'Euro-babe', then you may be disapointed by the few scenes but it kicks off from the start with a Natalie returning from a swim in the nude. The other significant scene comes when Natalie shows us everything as she takes a naked dip in the amazon river.",1053302400,6,684,4.48
