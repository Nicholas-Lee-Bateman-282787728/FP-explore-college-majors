2735972,5,B000MGTT5Y,I offer this to my wife. She is very happy and started to knitting a BSJ.,1200009600,2,73,3.625
2735973,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I have tried to knit the Baby Surprise Jacket in the past and just couldn't quite figure it out.  This DVD was perfect, and it also has instructions for different collars and a matching bonnet.  Very helpful!",1191456000,31,208,4.594594594594595
2735974,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I am what Elizabeth Zimmerman called a ""blind follower,"" and this DVD helped me knit a Baby Surprise Jacket with little difficulty or frustration. Zimmerman's pattern is included in this DVD, but the directions can be a bit unclear. After watchiing this DVD, the cryptic pattern for the darling Baby Surprise Jacket will suddenly make sense. You can pause or return to a particular section over and over, if necessary. The DVD also includes a pattern for a matching bonnet and some tips for adapting the pattern to suit your needs (how to add a collar, how to lengthen the arms, how to trim with an i-cord).

This DVD is a must have for the visual learner.",1191110400,55,656,4.6068376068376065
2735975,5,B000MGTT5Y,this sweater pattern is the greatest and easy quick just kove this pattern the disk is good takes you through each step clear and good instructions,1189900800,2,147,4.6923076923076925
2735976,5,B000MGTT5Y,I really like the visual dvd .. it helped so much i really love this product,1180656000,6,76,3.8125
2735977,5,B000MGTT5Y,"Although I consider myself a experienced knitter, I found this DVD very useful in knitting this wonderful sweater.  You follow Meg Swansen through all key steps of this project.  It also includes directions for adding a collar and a bonnet.  It is truly amazing that a sweater can be knitted in one piece, which eliminates to much seaming...you only need to seam at the shoulders.",1179360000,40,380,4.815384615384615
2735978,4,B000MGTT5Y,I have knit four of these little surprises now.  Wish the pattern instructions were printed larger.  The DVD helped answer many questions!,1400284800,3,138,5.2272727272727275
2735979,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I chose this design because you can make it with one skein of self striping sock yarn.  It comes out in the most awesome pattern!  I did it in a couple of days and it came out beautifully.  It is fun to knit because you keep thinking, ""I don't understand how this will work"" and then at the end, it just comes together.  I made two sweaters, one with self striping sock yarn, and another with two colors of ultra pima cotton and they both were delightful.  I highly recommend this pattern.",1399766400,4,489,4.271739130434782
2735980,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I had the pattern for well over a year.  Read it again and again but just couldn't bring myself to start it, couldn't make heads or tails of it.  Deciding to order the DVD was a great investment!  I watched from beginning to end then started over with yarn and needles in hand.  Meg walked me through each step giving me the confidence I needed.  I finished my first sweater using a solid color and have started on the second which will have stripes.

My math is NOT what it should be so this really helped me.  I'd like to make the jacket in an adult size but will have to adjust my head for the sizing.  lol  Hope it doesn't take me another year to get up the courage to give it a try.",1396569600,2,687,4.029629629629629
2735981,5,B000MGTT5Y,"This jacket has been a staple among knitters for babies, toddlers and even adults for years - the simplicity of Zimmerman's pattern is astounding, and this updated pattern folder makes it even easier to craft.  If you love the baby surprise - don't miss this copy!",1395532800,,264,4.739130434782608
2735982,2,B000MGTT5Y,"Doesn't say anything more than the books.  You don't need this and it is ONLY the baby jacket you still have to pay for
the child pattern 14 plus shipping .",1384473600,4,156,4.032258064516129
2735983,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I bought this for my daughter who is a beginning knitter.  I have made several of the BSJ and she wanted me to teach her and her dorm-mate how to do this simple little jacket so they could give them as gifts to friends who were new mothers.
She came home from school and we never got around to knitting, so I bought this DVD as an alternative that she can do on her own time... she loves it and has already completed one little sweater in time for a baby shower she was invited to.  It was easy for her to rewind and go back to see any technique that she had questions about (without calling mommy!)

I did watch this DVD myself before I sent it off to her and it is absolutely perfect.  Meg is such a loving and patient teacher who makes the knitter feel confident in their technique and their project.  She makes it seem easy for anyone, because she shows some common mistakes, she laughs them off and shows the knitter how to easily fix the problem without any care or fuss.... Plus the scenery out there in the woods with her yarn and the birds singing away is just lovely.  It's a peaceful and sweet DVD that is good for anyone wanting to learn this pattern.",1383782400,6,1163,4.192825112107624
2735984,5,B000MGTT5Y,Having the dvd was a great help in making the jacket as written instructions can be quite difficult to interpret.,1374710400,,113,4.7
2735985,5,B000MGTT5Y,I'm a Danish knitter and I saw the BSJ on pinterest. I liked it very much and wanted to knit it but I couldn't buy the knitting pattern in Denmark. I started to look for it on the internet and found this DVD. I have never knitted an American knitting pattern so it was very helpful with a DVD which I easily could follow.,1373673600,,321,4.03125
2735986,5,B000MGTT5Y,This DVD is a must for anyone who wants to knit this baby jacket. Meg Swanson has explained the pattern very clearly and I really enjoyed listening to her explain this very clever pattern. I had knitted one before I got the DVD but still learned a lot from watching and listening to her. Definitely recommend this project and the DVD.,1373155200,,334,4.491803278688525
2735987,5,B000MGTT5Y,Very good DVD to follow while knitting this baby jacket.  Easy to follow and goes step by step.  Worth buying because instructions are hard to follow without it.,1372118400,,161,4.714285714285714
2735988,5,B000MGTT5Y,"As a new knitter, I completed my BSJ with a minimum of difficulty. The video explained everything.  I'm working on my CSJ now.",1352937600,,126,4.478260869565218
2735989,5,B000MGTT5Y,"A very good investment for me.  I found the pattern to be quite sketchy and the video saved me much time and stress.  She makes everything so clear in the film it has enabled me (a novice sweater knitter) to be happy with the finished product.  It was really hard to visualize that this funny looking thing would turn into a sweater, but just keep knitting with the film and you will be surprised - especially at how perfect the stripes are.",1352073600,,441,4.353658536585366
2735990,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I had previously purchased the book, ""The Opinionated Knitter,"" by Elizabeth Zimmermann,"" and while it is a very good collection of her newsletters, I didn't find it all that easy to work the baby jacket just from her instructions alone.  I had too many questions, and no one to ask.  This DVD, which is narrated by her daughter, Meg Swansen, is the best way to learn the techniques for this versatile baby jacket.  You can pause it where you need to in order to take more time to work something that you might find a tad confusing at first, and then continue on with the next set of instruction.  I would suggest, however, watching it all the way through once before you begin knitting along with it. You'll know what comes next, and what you may find a bit confusing at first where you'll need to pay particular or close attention when actually doing the knitting. You can always back it up, if need be, to watch a certain segment again and then continue as Meg does another step. I watch it on my computer as I'm knitting which I find very helpful.  Meg is such a peaceful influence -- nothing seems to get her flustered -- which I find very calming. I tend to become quite frustrated when I can't understand something. Then, too, she is knitting ""in the woods"" someplace where even the background sounds are restful. You have a 1-1 ratio between you the knitter, and her (with help from her mother) as your own personal instructor. If you really want to master the BSJ, this is the way to do it. There are written directions included in the DVD, along with the sketched drawing that is also in the book (which I found very confusing--until I watched the video) and also directions for adding a collar and making a bonnet. Meg also included ways to make the jacket larger, for an older child. I imagine I'll be making plenty of them in the future, and would highly recommend this video to anyone who is wanting to make the BSJ!!",1346112000,6,1931,4.458923512747876
2735991,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I purchased this DVD to help me with the construction of the BSJ - aside from numerous hats, this is my first big knitting project. It has been beyond helpful! I've already knitted half of the sweater and am confident about finishing this project. A must if you are new to knitting and a visual learner like myself.",1338940800,,315,4.448275862068965
2735992,4,B000MGTT5Y,"I'm an advanced beginner knitter, and I tried and tried to figure out how to knit this adorable jacket.  The video made it so easy and fun.  Can't wait to make another one.",1337817600,3,172,4.181818181818182
2735993,5,B000MGTT5Y,I love this video. They really zoom in on the shots and you can really see what their doing. There's also a free tutorial on YouTube. But with this jacket I want all the advice I can get my hands on.,1324512000,,199,3.8780487804878048
2735994,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I have not yet made the BSJ.  Haven't even attempted it, although the fingers are itching to do so.  However, I did slide the DVD into the player one recent evening when life was feeling way too chaotic, just for something different for a minute.  Well, about 30 minutes later, I got up, refreshed!  I've never watched a knitting video or show, but I gotta say, if you need a break from the whirl of everyday life, this is a great video even if you're not knitting along!

Now, I can't wait to finish the current baby sweater to have another peaceful interlude - this time with yarn and needles in hand! - with Meg Swanson.",1317945600,4,623,4.336206896551724
2735995,5,B000MGTT5Y,"Great DVD, easy to follow.  Great sweater...I love the classic designs of Elizabeth Zimmerman...Narrated by her daughter Meg Swansen",1266796800,,132,5.947368421052632
2735996,5,B000MGTT5Y,"Meg Swansen is interesting and informative.  Her voice is not the least bit annoying and it is awesome to be able to watch over the shoulder of a master knitter as she goes about making this sweater.  The Surprise Jacket is both simple and complex.  I am really glad I bought the video.  If I hadn't, this pattern would have become a UFO in my stash.  I have been knitting for 5 years, but I become easily discouraged if the pattern confuses me.

Meg shows you lots of little tips and tricks that you can use or not as you knit this sweater or any other.  Meg demonstrates how she does pairs of increases and decreases.  She shows buttonholes and even a few tips using the long tail cast on method.  There is additional instruction on making a collar for the sweater and knitting a matching baby hat.

The video sound and picture are both very clear.  You can really see what Meg is doing.  She does a lot of the knitting outdoors in a beautiful woodland in Autumn.  This is one of the best videos on knitting that I have seen.",1264636800,3,1027,4.286458333333333
2735997,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I wanted to knit up a Baby-Surprise Jacket like nobody's business, but being a neophyte knitter, I had a terrible time figuring out the pattern from books.

This video was a lifesaver.  Thank you, Meg Swanson.  Not only for helping me knit up lots of these sweet little jackets, but also for making me a better knitter.",1253318400,4,319,4.56140350877193
2735998,5,B000MGTT5Y,"Concept is unique and easy to understand even for a novice like myself.
Very professional and comprehensive.",1240876800,2,108,5.411764705882353
2735999,4,B000MGTT5Y,"Meg does a great job of making MOST of her mom's directions clear. Plus, she does a good job of showing some good tips to making it better. I only wish she gave insight about making this sweater in different sizes.",1226880000,8,214,4.2439024390243905
2736000,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I bought this DVD (along with a ball of Noro sock yarn) for my mother-in-law who has been learning to knit.  She prefers to teach herself, buying books, etc, and only consulting with me when she can't figure something out on her own.  I knew the idea of making a baby jacket would intimidate her, though the decreases are the only technique she hasn't done yet, so I got the DVD, having heard that it walks the viewer through each step, giving her the privacy of learning she likes.  Sure enough she was intimidated at the idea of making a baby sweater, but for my sake attempted it, and is surprised and delighted at her progress.  She'll even show me how she's doing! which looks great.  She's shown me parts of the DVD.

So.  While I have not personally used this item, I can say that it appears to be a wonderful resource, and wouldn't mind watching it myself.",1225670400,10,864,4.39622641509434
2736001,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I'm so glad I bought the DVD and not the book. The written instructions are included, however, I would not have been able to knit and finish this great little Baby Jacket without the wonderful, clear instructions on the DVD. I highly recommend this DVD.",1223942400,6,253,4.644444444444445
2736002,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I got this DVD to ""try out"" the Meg Swansen DVD's. It wasn't very expensive so I thought I would give it a shot, this pattern has always been a bit hard to read for me. Wow, what a great DVD. So many fantastic knitting tips any knitter could use for any patterns. It was a wonderful DVD, I have more on my wish list now!",1218412800,6,320,3.8636363636363638
2736003,5,B000MGTT5Y,"I knew I wanted to try knitting the Baby Surprise Sweater but I hestitated to invest in this DVD for a long while. Since the pattern is nowhere to be found free (unless you go to the library and borrow Elizabeth Zimmerman's book) I finally took the plunge and ordered the DVD.
Why didn't I just borrow the book?  I don't particularly like Elizabeth Zimmerman's ""style"" of writing, and I knew with such an unorthodox pattern, I would need help or end up pulling my hair out.

I am extremely happy with the DVD!  Meg Swansen does a wonderful job guiding us through each step of the sweater.  The DVD is about an hour and a half long and has 28 Chapters.  Once more, the entire session is filmed outdoors in a wooded section that is so relaxing to watch.

I am now a 'fan' of this pattern, and look forward to knitting many many more!
So if you are hesitating, please don't any longer!

I would venture to say that it takes the confusion out of knitting this sweater, and once you have cast off all stitches, you need a visual guide to show you how to fold your misshapen fabric so it forms sleeves, a back, and front, that only needs shoulder seams stitched. You get this visuality on the DVD.

I made minor mistakes but the finished product is still usable. You can see photos here: [...]",1213574400,13,1287,4.333333333333333
2736004,5,B000MGTT5Y,"What a treat to watch an artist create EZ's world famous jacket.  Also, I don't get to see many knitters work, so just watching her hands was a lesson for me.  This video clarified the math involved in the jacket and especially clarified the (to me) confusion regarding the stitch marked by the safety-pin....and if the pin goes on the needle or really on the fabric.  As I won't be going to knit camps any time soon, I enjoy having this bit of knitting history on my book shelf.",1210723200,2,479,4.359550561797753
2736005,4,B000MGTT5Y,This DVD made following the patteren very easy.  I really liked how easy this pattern is.  The sweater turned out really cute.  The filming of the instructions was very well done.,1208563200,5,179,4.709677419354839
2736006,5,B000MGTT5Y,"This DVD features Meg Swansen teaching the construction of her mother's famous Baby Surprise Jacket.  I purchased it as an afterthought along with The Opinionated Knitter.  Not only did it explain the sweater very well, I learned several simple techniques for knitting that I had never seen before within the first ten minutes!  I've been knitting over 40 years, and have regular ""stitch -n- bitch"" sessions with knitting friends, but this added so much to my knowledge base that I am looking for other DVDs in the series.  Buy it now!",1205107200,19,535,4.846153846153846
2736007,5,B000MGTT5Y,"The DVD was fun to watch.  The pattern for the jacket is wonderful - especially the information on how to add a collar (my original paper pattern did not have this information).  I made the 12 month version and it took approximately 400 yards of worsted.
Meg also adds so many helpful tips.  I never knew that binding off the last 2 stitches together would eliminate the odd bump or tail.  Previously I had always been unhappy with the last bind off stitch.  Also I hate small circles when I have to use double point needles - knitting with 2 circular is so much easier, I no longer dread attempting socks!",1204761600,2,606,4.423423423423423
