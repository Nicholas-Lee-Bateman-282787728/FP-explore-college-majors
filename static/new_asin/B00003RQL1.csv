1332626,4,B00003RQL1,"I love these sleeper films. Subtle performances from a solid cast, A Slight Case of Murder is a classy, light-hearted who-done-it with a satisfying conclusion.",1178668800,9,159,5.4
1332627,3,B00003RQL1,"Based on a story by mystery writer Donald Westlake, this movie benefits from an Emmy nominated performance from the always reliable William H. Macy.  Macy plays a movie critic who finds himself in a pickle when an argument with his lover leads to her accidental death.  A game of cat and mouse ensues when a sleazy private investigator who was following the woman realizes Macy has killed her.

Macy has some choice moments as he addresses the audience during his dilemma and receives good support from his real life wife Felicity Huffman who plays his other girlfriend and from crusty James Cromwell as the PI.  Adam Arkin is also very good as the police detective who sees Macy as a channel to get his screenplay sold.  A twisty plot involves Macy and Arkin's wife, with the resultant resolution appropos.

Entertaining variation on the noir genre.",1171324800,4,850,4.827586206896552
1332628,4,B00003RQL1,"OK. So, I stumbled upon this movie, chosen by a friend, and not expecting it to actually be good, was totally caught off guard. This is actually, in my opinion, not only completely clever in the humor, but some of William H. Macy's best comedic work, on par with ""Fargo"". While I could analyze the appropriateness of the genre and all that jazz, and I am just going to suffice it to say that it is an entertaining movie with humor right up the alley of those seeking humor slightly off the beaten path. As is necessary for a good film, it boasts a completely talented cast, and I was impressed no only by William Macy's performance, but also by Adam Arkin,a completely overlooked and incredibly talented actor.",1052179200,17,710,4.5546875
1332629,3,B00003RQL1,"I found this movie to be cute and funny in some places, and strangely repellent in others.  The overall premise was good, and there were lots of great scenes like the bank robbery, and appealing characters like the detective with a screenplay (Adam Arkin) and the protagonists sassy girlfriend Kit (Felicity Huffman) but as the story continued, the main character became less and less likable, and the so called villains more likable.  Nor was this just some ploy to show that we're all human underneath or something, because the tone of the film was still flippant and disturbing.  The screenplay was unbalanced.  In its attempt to give us a flawed anti-hero like all good film noirs, it created a bit of a monster.",1023667200,6,716,4.796747967479675
1332630,5,B00003RQL1,"Like some of the best movies I have seen, I caught this one by accident.  I am not going to go into some long winded review about ""film noir"" blah, blah, blah.  I recommend this movie to anybody that has not seen it.  If you like movies like ""Three O'Clock High"", ""Red Rock West"", ""After Hours"" or if you liked ""Fargo""...check this one out.",995328000,13,340,4.28125
1332631,3,B00003RQL1,"It is probably the reductio ad absurdum of the self-conscious neo-noir that its ultimate hero/villain/victim should be a film critic, about as far removed from the original prole/lower-middle-class noir heroes (e.g. 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', 'Double Indemnity') as you could get.  Faced with a crisis (he accidentally murders his lover), Terry Thorpe turns it into a screenplay, a fiction - if he plays by the film noir rules, he can worm his way out of it.  And this is what saves the film from smart-alecky ghastliness - it is a film about mid-life crisis, the flaws and difficulties of the modern, affluent, middle-aged man.  It seems like noir can still speak for people rather than to itself, but this often palls.  the best joke is a corpse called Laura who doesn't get up.",990144000,3,787,4.850746268656716

7919357,5,B00003RQL1,"Funny, slightly ""dark humor"" movie about a guy who just keeps making dumb mistakes and gets himself in quite the pinch.  My dad made me watch it with him, and I loved it! Not too graphic, more about the story than anything gory.",1385683200,,228,4.3023255813953485
