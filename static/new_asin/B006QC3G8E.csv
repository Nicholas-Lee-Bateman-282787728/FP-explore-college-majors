That said, this DVD took what we learned in vol 1 to another level of impressive moves.  On this one they cover 'the whip' (amongst other moves and techniques) which we have been really enjoying showcasing at our favorite venue.  Again with easy to follow instructions and we are always impressed with Shawn and Joanna's outgoing and fun personalities throughout the video.  I highly recommend this DVD and all 6 of their new west coast swing dvds.",1398643200,,547,4.494949494949495
8502983,5,B006QC3G8E,"I've watched a number of dance videos, from the DVDs I purchased online (I now own 12!) & a few loaned from the libraries. Got to say that the videos produced by Shawn Trautman Dance Instructions are by far The BEST!!! The instructions are very clear, & the arrangement & pace are just PERFECT for a beginner/intermediate dancer like me. Shawn & Joanna deliver the moves the simplest way so everybody gets it regardless of one's tyle of learning. Stay active & be entertained on your own or with a partner using S & J Trautman's videos. I guarantee you will be satisfied with the contents of all his videos as I truly am. WCS DVDs by S. Trautman - a great investment for health!

Further, I've taken so far 30 hrs of group lessons on WCS & 22 hours of Ballroom. I can now assert that 50% of my learning is attributed to my religious practice with Shawn Trautman's DVD instructions, 25% on group lessons & 25% over practice with other dancers. 'So lucky that I get to watch & practice with friends over again & anywhere using Trautman's videos. Dancing is a great form of exercise & entertainment to stay healthy. So, I strongly recommend to buy!",1345161600,,1145,4.478468899521531
