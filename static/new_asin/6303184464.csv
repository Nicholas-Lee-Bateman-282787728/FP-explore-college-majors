596783,5,6303184464,Bing Crosby with a great supporting cast and a great story line and a lesson to be learned: money means nothing if you aren't happy. I thought the remake was much better than the original film (Broadway Bill).,1369872000,,209,4.526315789473684

596785,4,6303184464,A lesser known but quite enjoyable movie of Bing involving a racehorse and a love affair. Fans of Bing Crosby need to see this one. You might become a fan if you aren't one already.,1357948800,,181,4.2
596786,3,6303184464,"On the whole this is a nice romantic comedy, but ***SPOILER*** the horse dies towards the end which ruined it for me.",1262044800,,117,4.363636363636363
596787,4,6303184464,"Bing Crosby is quite good in this movie, neither a straight-up crooner nor half a comedy act.
He plays a rather ordinary fellow who gets mixed up with an extraordinarily stuffy family by falling in love w/ one of the (temporarily) available daughters.
Horse sense prevents one huge mistake, but Bing almost misses out on the ""Princess"" who'd like to be his queen (Coleen Gray).
More than one totally silly musical scene, including ""Bake a Sunshine Cake,"" and ""The Horse Told Me.""
Attempts at stabbing in the back (after all, there's a big horse race at stake) and a little good-natured conniving add depth to the story.  The underdog (in this case a horse and his owner) come out on top, the girl gets her man, and even Bing's future father-in-law shows a glimmer of horse sense in the end (Charles Bickford is perfect for the role!).

596789,1,6303184464,"I am quoting Humphrey Bogart in the above title of this review.  He was referring to a film his own production company, Santana Productions, made called ""Sirocco.""  .
I tend not to review movies I don't like because I have no enthusiasm for them.  In fact, this is the first time I have done so.  Everything about this movie is inane:  the performances (especially Coleen Gray's, whose idea of acting is to grin as widely as possible and sparkle her eyes.  One wishes she had never gone into the business.), the silly dialogue, the phony script, etc., etc.
It only has two things going for it:  A beautiful horse which is a delight to watch, though frustrating as the characters treat him so shabbily, and his mascot and pal, a darling rooster,  Obviously trained to be performers, they easily outshine all their human co-actors.
Oh, and the music.  Insipid, especially a song called ""The Sunshine Cake.""  Sentimentality at its most obnoxious.  Bing finally does sing ""Camptown Races,"" but by this time you don't care.
There are better horse movies.  There are much better Crosby movies.  Can't think of one good reason to view this one unless you want to waste your time!",1028246400,7,1172,4.742574257425742

7841051,5,6303184464,"Love this movie! If your a fan of Frank Capra movies, this will not disappoint! I didn't know if I was going to like it during the first 15-20 minutes or so, but soon got into the story and our whole family loved it. It's so good. I wish movies were still like the old ones!",1471824000,,274,3.9107142857142856

7841055,5,6303184464,Excellent performance by Bing and very upbeat.  Actors obviously enjoyed it just as director Capra planned it but did not get it in the original.  Crosby made a huge upgrade.,1436313600,,174,4.766666666666667

7841057,5,6303184464,It's Bing Crosby- of course it's adorable! I don't usually like black and white films but I decided to take a chance on this and I am so glad I did. His acting is superb. He constant makes me laugh. If you are a Bing Crosby fan this is a must have!!,1411344000,,249,3.8076923076923075

Bing is a real hoot!",1405382400,,80,3.764705882352941
7841059,5,6303184464,"With his signature charm, spell-binding voice, and honest acting, Bing Crosby demonstrates why he was the pied piper of the entertainment industry for 30 years. Plus, it's an amazing horse film! :)",1376438400,,197,5.1875
