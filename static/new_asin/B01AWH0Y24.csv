8748687,5,B01AWH0Y24,"I found ""The Danish Girl"" to be a beautiful, haunting, heartbreaking portrait of a woman who suffered the agony of life in the wrong body in an era when her condition was believed both insane and deviant.  Einar/Lili's struggle to find someone who could not only help her but even understand her is riveting, and no viewer with a heart cannot fail to be wrenched with grief at the ending.

I was immediately interested in finding out more about Lili Elbe's life, and discovering that the film is by no means a documentary still didn't ruin it for me.  Director Tom Hooper weaves emotion, the historical period and the fantastic performances so seamlessly that the film more than stands on its own.  Eddie Redmayne is surely the finest actor of his generation, and Alicia Vikander brings so much heart and soul into her performance as Gerda that these two could carry any script and make it convincing.

Beautiful cinema, of a quality seldom seen today. Be aware, again, that it is not a documentary, and much of the script is fictionalized.  Still a haunting piece, especially in this era of LGBT rights.",1485907200,,1104,4.723958333333333
