Billy's look for love is joined in this light-hearted comedy by his lightly homoerotic-fulfilling photography, fag hag friends, older gay mentor, and obsession over his male model subject  Gabriel, but not knowing if he's ""in the club"".  The movie has  many coming-of-queer nuances that lets every gay man say ""yep, I did  the same thing.""
The movie follows a definite story line (that's a  good thing) with some oh-so-attractive guys and gals.

192552,5,1573624365,"Director Tommy O'Haver seems to have been unable to choose between making Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss a no-nonsense romantic comedy or a Fellini epic. (Check out the excellent director's commentary, where he mentions Fellini's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fellini-Satyricon/dp/B000059H9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fellini - Satyricon</a>&nbsp;as a potential model.) Whether this is a distraction or part of the movie's charm will depend on the viewer, but either way it's an enjoyable and worthwhile movie.

Although characterized as a ""gay film"", the dilemma the main character faces will be familiar to everyone in all but the particulars. The reason his cute love interest may or may not be available (is he or isn't he?) isn't important: we've all probably had the experience of falling in love (or lust) with someone who is tantalizingly unavailable to us; we've all probably chased someone who is ""wrong"" for us and ignored someone who is ""right""; and we've probably all been in a situation something like the hysterical bedroom scene.

For those who've only seen Sean Hayes in Will & Grace and had some doubt, the good news is that he apparently can act. Brad Rowe more than adequately fills the eye-candy quota.

192554,3,1573624365,"There's nothing wrong with a pleasant film about a gay photographer struggling in LA with not only his career but his growing infatuation with a handsome, ambiguous model. Its modesty is its chief appeal and its chief limitation, as screenwriter/director Tommy O'Haver knowingly dubs the 1998 film a trifle in the credits. Cast before he hit big as Jack McFarland in ""Will and Grace"", Sean Hayes affectingly plays Billy with nary the supercilious flamboyance that has become his TV character's trademark. It's nice to see that he can do more subtle work even if the material doesn't demand much from him. In typical bo-ho LA fashion, Billy is trying to make a career of taking Polaroid snaps that recall classic screen kisses from the silver screen. He meets Gabriel, a waiter and aspiring model who has a girlfriend but gives signals to Billy of a more prurient interest.

The is-he-or-isn't-he dilemma Billy has about Gabriel takes them separately to Catalina where things work out in a way quite unlike any 1950's Hollywood movie, at least the mainstream kind. That's really it. Naturally, there are scenes of lip-syncing drag queens and Billy's movie-inspired fantasies, but it's mostly by-the-numbers stuff. What does work is the way O'Haver does not make it all about sex and reveals characters in a more gradual manner than one would expect given the premise. Brad Pitt look-alike Brad Rowe fulfills the physical requirements of this role as the desired Gabriel, while the rest of the cast perform gamely in stock roles - Meredith Scott Lynn as Billy's best-girl roommate and Paul Bartel as Billy's queenly photography mentor. A nice musical soundtrack has been assembled, while the quickly released DVD unsurprisingly has no extras.",1174694400,,1740,5.083916083916084

Add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others (Sean P. Hayes' character) while simply pursuing your own desires.  (""I want to be there for him."")  Right.  It's so artificial, it's about as convincing as plastic palm trees.

There are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers, but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long, heart-felt pauses of nothing.

Someone made this picture to fulfill their dream, and did a fine job of casting and cinematography.  There is little else to see here.  Even as a fluff piece, it's barely worth your time.",1106265600,3,1133,4.783505154639175
192593,3,1573624365,"BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS

(USA - 1998)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

An LA photographer (Sean Hayes) falls madly in lust with an aspiring model (Brad Rowe) who's been hired to pose in a series of pictures inspired by old-time Hollywood movies. But Hayes receives mixed signals from the object of his desire - is he gay, or isn't he? - which leads to complications of the heart...

Described during the closing credits as a 'trifle' by writer-director Tommy O'Haver (ELLA ENCHANTED), this unassuming confection asks little more of its audience than to enjoy the scenery (both geographical and human!) and to pine along with its luckless protagonist as he pursues the hunk of his dreams. Those familiar with Hayes' outrageous turn in TV's ""Will & Grace"" may be disappointed by his restraint as a bland, scatterbrained idealist who learns the hard way that the course of true love never ran smoothly, especially in LA. Spiced with dream sequences that recreate moments from Hollywood's 'golden age' (most impressively, an Astaire-Rogers dance routine between Hayes and Rowe to the strains of Petula Clark, with drag queens on backing vocals!), the film pays affectionate tribute to the movies of a bygone era, movies which inspire the leading character on his never-ending quest for perfect happiness. Watch out for the magical scene in which Hayes and Rowe share a bed for purely platonic reasons, only to end up touching each other by 'accident'...

Though fluffy and inconsequential, the film is rescued from anonymity by an excellent supporting cast, including Meredith Scott Lynn (STANDING ON FISHES) and Richard Ganoung (PARTING GLANCES) as Hayes' best friends, Paul Bartel (EATING RAOUL) as a veteran photographer who lures Rowe into his professional circle, Carmine D. Giovinazzo (IN ENEMY HANDS) as a stoner who offers Hayes and Lynn a place to stay on his yacht after they pursue Rowe to Bartel's photo-shoot in Catalina (Giovinazzo's rear-view nude scene is funny and sexy, all at the same time!), and Warhol 'superstar' Holly Woodlawn (WOMEN IN REVOLT) as a musical attraction at the gayest party in town! Filmed in vivid color and widescreen Panavision, cinematographer Mark Mervis (HELLBENT) uses every inch of the scope frame in a painterly fashion, though his beautiful panoramic compositions were resisted by the film's nervous backers, according to O'Haver's fascinating DVD audio commentary. Sadly, for his next film (GET OVER IT), the director opted for Super 35, which isn't the same thing at all...",1077408000,,2564,5.213592233009709

192596,4,1573624365,"Billy?s Hollywood Screen Kiss is an enjoyable, fluffy romp through the perils of gay relationships. Aspiring photographer Billy (Sean Hayes) has big ideas but lacks the necessary ingredients to bring his ideas to life: namely funding and models. With the help and encouragement of his roommate Georgina and his friend Perry, he decides to pursue his dreams. His model comes in the form of Gabriel, an appropriately named aspiring-actor, table-waiting hunk. Billy manages to persuade Gabriel to model for his latest project, a series of remakes of famous Hollywood screen kisses, featuring male couples, but Billy is after more than just a great shot. He?d also like to win Gabriel?s heart. Only one problem, Gabriel is straight.
The writing is solid and features some great dialogue. The cast was well chosen and some of the actors, particularly Richard Ganoung as Perry, bring a depth to their supporting character role that adds another dimension to the movie. Of course, Sean Hayes is better known for playing Jack on Will & Grace. His performance in Billy is excellent and surprisingly restrained.
While the movie isn't spectacularly groundbreaking, it is a good movie. It's a little darker than many gay romantic comedies, no easy happy endings here, but it still leaves you satisfied and hopeful. Recommended.",1051574400,,1315,5.178403755868545
192597,5,1573624365,"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (BHKS) is a movie that deals with the ubiquitous gay theme of unrequited love. Most gay men will identify with falling in love with someone and for whatever reason that person turns out to be Mr Wrong. This is the theme that BHKS handles extremely well.
Billy (played by Will and Grace's Sean Hayes) is an out of work LA based photographer with a perchant for polariods who falls for an out of work bass player and current waiter Gabriel (Brad Rowe). The problem is that Billy is uncertain which way Gabriel 'swings', and Gabriel doesn't seem to be able to provide any answers himself. Is he or isn't he??? And if he is, why isn't he interested in Billy????
We never truely get the answer to those questions, but the journey we travel with Billy and Gabriel brings up some lovely (and some confronting) themes that gay men everywhere can relate too.
When the film first starts you know you're in for a treat - stills of polariod photographs  are used to illustrate various storyline movements and Billy's dream sequences are nothing short of brilliant - drag queens miming beautiful songs such as 'This is my song' by Petula Clark provide the backdrop for those dream sequences, with Billy and Gabriel interacting in a tender, romantic way that is reminiscent of the MGM musicals of yesteryear.
Speaking of the MGM musical influence, BHSK does not exactly imitate those movies, but rather takes elements from them to create something truely unique - right down to the musical sequences and the bold, bright colours used in the sets of the movie.
For those who are only familar with Sean Hayes as 'Jack' on Will and Grace are in for a complete surprise. He has the wonderful ability to show the disappointed that comes with unrequited love in a very effective and subtle way. He really is a good actor and hopefully we will see more of him in future film roles.
A special mention needs to made of the opening title sequence - this alone is worthy of an oscar!!! It is a very funny drag queen sequence that immediately gives the film a vibrant, original feel.
The DVD itself has the movie plus a trailer and a promo for the soundtrack. The only other extra is the audio commentary by the director Tommy O'Haver. Tommy is very entertaining on the commentary and provides us with an indepth discussion of making a film on a low budget. Hopefully we will be seeing more quality film from Tommy in the future.
BHSK is a lovely little movie that deals with the often traumatic theme of unrequited love in the gay world. Though the ending isn't exactly upbeat, we are left with a positive feeling of true love being just around the corner. It may not be to everyone's liking, but if you like arthouse movies that stir the emotions and leave you with a positive glow, make sure you watch BHSK.",1043539200,5,2814,4.594433399602385
192598,5,1573624365,a must see if you love sean hayes. even though he's not jack you fall in love with billy just as fast as you fell for jack. its not even really a comedy it has its funny moments but its more touching. i also recommend the music its great also and goes with the movie perfectly!!!,1041811200,,279,4.0
192599,4,1573624365,"Although this film is marketed as a comedy, I found it to be more of a bittersweet, almost traditional tale of unrequited love. Although, in this case, the man in love is Billy, a gay photographer portrayed by Sean Hayes (prior to his Will and Grace success) and the object of his affection is a sexually ambivalent hunk named Gabriel, played by Brad Rowe.
Billy is old-fashioned in his passion for Gabriel, not only because he is not sure whether or not Gabriel is gay or shares his affection, but also because Billy is a gentleman, who prefers old-time movies and screen kisses. He uses Gabriel as a model in a series of photographs, re-creating famous screen kisses, but using two men as the stars.
The relationship between Billy and Gabriel is both sweet and frustrating. Their sexual tension is palpable, and it is incredibly erotic seeing them tentatively express affection, rather than seeing anything explicit. Sean Hayes is very good as Billy, and he plays a very low-key, somewhat shy character. He proves he is much more than, well, ""Just Jack""!
There are also the usual dream sequences, and supporting characters typical of many gay films, such as the straight female best friend, and the older, wiser gay mentor. There are also some very unattractive drag queens lip synching Petula Clark songs. However, this is an atypical ""gay film"" that is really very much like an old-fashioned romance, the kind that Billy enjoys. The acting is very good all-around, the production quality is high, even though it must have been filmed on a small budget. It doesn't look or feel like a low-budget independent, and it is sad and sweet and worthy of repeat viewings.
The DVD version contains director commentary by writer/director Tommy O'Haver that is almost as entertaining as the movie. He explains how he was able to make this movie look so good on such a small budget, about the friends and relatives who helped out, and about why he chooses not to make this film a gay fantasy, but rather a realtistic love story. It's really incredibly good and entertaining, and you can also see that he saw a true talent in Sean Hayes long before everyone else did.",1040947200,,2157,4.770053475935829

With Sean Hayes as the star I was expecting to be rolling on the floor with laughter, however this was more of a light drama than a comedy. Most of the humour relied on the association factor of ""been there, done that"" and the normally hilarious Mr Hayes played a basically ""straight"" (only in one sense of the word) role.
My recommendation for those considering the purchase of this DVD is to rent it first. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but don't think it is one of those movies I will watch over and over again.",1029369600,4,681,4.328125

As Billy, a struggling photographer, Hayes portrays a young man dealing with his feelings for the handsome object of his affection played by Brad Rowe.  Quirky and interesting, the film follows the lead character on his quest for love and his attempts to find out if his mysterious attraction is straight or gay.  His longing for Gabriel (I guess named for his angelic face) is sad and familiar to anyone, gay or straight, who has fallen in love with a beauty only to be turned away.

192643,4,1573624365,"Okay, it's another homobittersweetsexual movie.  This one is set in a garish place called Hollywood, if you choose to believe a place populated by such shallow people really exists.  It's also a delightful trifle.
Had I written this review shortly after receiving the DVD I would have gone on gushily about how great it is, but it hasn't worn that well with repeated viewings.  The slender thread - should I say tease - upon which the plot hangs, ""is he or isn't he,"" ""will he or won't he,"" hasn't sustained my interest that much on subsequent viewings.
Still, it's a fun movie.
Sean Hayes is wonderful in this endearing role he created before becoming a stereotypical queen on ""Will and Grace.""  The other characters are not as well drawn and mostly too true to simplistic stereotypes but are entertaining.  Brad Rowe plays the somewhat naive but just-a-little-bit curious hunk well.  It isn't a role that I'm very sympathetic to.  I realize he was supposed to be more wooden and less graceful than Billy, and a bit of a tease and a bit of a jerk, but I kept wondering if he was chosen just for his Brad Pitt looks.
I am not a fan of drag or musicals, but the fantasy sequences were a real hoot, particularly the dance number with Billy and Gabriel and the Petula Clark numbers.  Besides Hayes acting, these are the best parts of the film.
Director Tommy O'Haver has a few cute cinematic tricks up his sleeve.  The use of the Polaroid as integral to the story was fine, but he was overly fond of it's use as a cinematic device.  I found the opening sequence and ""groovy"" credits tedious the first time thru and even more so on subsequent viewings.  When a film starts out by playing down to the audience and talking down to the audience, it's usually not a good sign, but fortunately the rest of the film treats the audience more intelligently.
The Polaroid device is also unfortunately used to present the tedious flashback of Billy's coming out, which I suppose is actually somewhat autobiographical of the director.  I suppose everybody thinks their coming out story is absolutely fascinating, but in truth they seldom are to anybody other than the teller.  Anyway, its preferable in a movie to show a prior coming out experience, if it's essential to the story, rather than just have a character narrate a slide show.  Billy's character is already the only well developed character in the film and this extra insight isn't necessary to the plot.
Besides the tiresome overuse of the Polaroid as a cinematic device, the scene in which Billy gets some quality PosturePedic time with Gabriel and starts acting like a rabbit in a lettuce patch was a bit heavy for a trifle like this.  I was grateful Gabriel quickly put a stop to it.
One of the best parts of the DVD is the track of director's comments; don't miss it.  There is a lot to the film that doesn't catch the eye of a casual viewer and I hope Mr. O'Haver has the opportunity to make more films, so long as he loses the Polaroid next time around.",1013817600,2,3006,4.569832402234637

Unfortunately, the last quarter of the film degenerates into a silly gidget-like outing to Catalina, but the last few scenes are well worth watching it through to the end.  Sean Hayes is just adorable with the goatee in the film, and plays a great gay without the ""flaming-queen"" shtick he does Jack in Will & Grace with.",975715200,3,616,4.194915254237288
192649,5,1573624365,I can not really say much more about this movie but Billy & Gabriel  were GREAT!  A real life situation for a NORMAL gay life.  Nothing to  glaring.  I get a warm fuzzy feeling every time I see this movie and have  seen it at least five times.  I will watch it again as well.,968284800,,275,3.890909090909091
192680,5,1573624365,"Recently re-watching this film about a year after I originally saw it, I was amazed at how enjoyable it remained on a second viewing. Using a style  perfected by Almodovar, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, is both charming and  sad. O'Haver's film appears fresh and vibrant at all times and it is such a  pleasure to see a gay love story told not as a subplot but as the driving  plot. From the opening credits to the sad and poignant finale each actor  contributes to the overall feel of the film. Sean P Hayes and Brad Rowe are  perfect as Billy and Gabriel.
Using a Gidget retro atmosphere to imbue a  certain kitsch could have easily failed but here it works. It made me laugh  and think how wonderful all those Annette Funicillo/Frankie Avalon beach  movies would and could have been with a gay subplot. It was also refreshing  to hear a soundtrack to a gay film that doesn't feature dance/club music.  The use of Nina Simone and Petula Clark were perfect in adding that retro  feel to hip and funky 1990's LA.
Billy's Holywood Screen Kiss works  beacuse of the cast, the unrequited love story, the music and the look of  the movie. O'Haver's has molded together all the elments to produce quality  fluff. Put it on and be prepared to feel good.",965433600,10,1248,4.533632286995516
192681,5,1573624365,"This story revolves around the friendship of two guys in LA, USA.  The story evolves to a mutual affection and the possibility of some thing more.  Sean P. Hayes from Will and Grace stars in this movie and must admit that  his acting skills are womderful.  Sean does not come across as an ancy 90's  queen, but the normal guy that just happens to be gay.
It is refreshing  to see a movie that does not include the topic of AIDS and promicquous sex  of the gay population.
In stead this movie reveals the desire of one  person to find the right individual.
The soundtrack by Petula Clark is  magic and is an exceptional choice for a wonderful movie.  The scenary and  chioce of locations if gorgeous.
A movie that I would recommend to the  whole family.",960854400,3,752,4.408759124087592
192682,5,1573624365,"A touching, funny, and sad story about a young photographer (""Will & Grace"" star Sean P. Hayes) and the object of his desire (Brad Rowe), ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,"" is an impressive  feature-film debut for director O'Haver. Set in Los Angeles (and concluding  on Santa Catalina island) Billy's infatuation with coffee-serving Gabriel  allows the viewer to grasp the idea of an ideal friendship in the gay 90's.  Gabriel's sexual ambiguity disturbs Billy's so called ""gaydar""  that Billy sets up a series of photographs inspired by classic films like  ""From Here to Eternity"" to see whether-or-not Gabriel is  gay.
The film serves a visionary eye palette of colors that gives the  film a catchy look. Utilizing methods to watch Nicholas Ray used in  ""Rebel Without A Cause,"" and what Pedro Almodovar utilized in  ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" (both films used a  technicolor red hue to give the protagonist a unique look) O'Haver  successfully incorporates great color schemes and excellent lighting.
The film has many sad points especially when Billy tells Gabriel the  significance of his Polaroid and especially the heartbreaking ending  (reminscent of the ending of ""Splendor in the Grass""). I was  fascinated my the creative use of the Polaroids in the telling of the  story.
Overall, both characters are cute, the supporting characters are  excellent, and the film's script is an original escape from today's  unoriginal recycled film scripts. An excellent film for all, regardless of  someone's sexual orientation.",959990400,8,1541,5.267489711934156
192683,5,1573624365,This is one of my favorite movie of 1998. The idea is brilliant and the two main characters are so cute & touching. They made my heart melt.,956620800,2,140,4.035714285714286
192684,5,1573624365,"This film is great. This film can be compared to other outstanding gay films such as ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Get Real"".
Billy is out to recreate some of the most famous Holywood kissing scenes with a  bit of a twist. When he needs to find a model, he finds Mr. Perfect while  being served a cup of coffee at a local diner. From then on, Billy is on a  quest to claim this new model as his new love and to finish his biggest  project yet. There are, however, some complications. Billy doesn't have  enough money to finish the project so he needs to find another source of  income and Billy doesn't know if his new crush is gay or str8.
Well, I  think I'll leave it at that. This is a very adorable tale of gay puppy  love. This movie is worth buying.",952300800,6,748,4.145833333333333
192685,5,1573624365,"""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" offers gay and straight film audiences something quite unique. It is a kitchy romantic love story with a gay twist, and all the trappings of a goofy romance. Sean Hayes absolutely  shines as the boy-next-door, hopeless romantic photographer pre- ""Will  and Grace"" days. Beware: Billy is not ""Jack"", and you will  come to love his character just the same! A great supporting cast adds  flavor, and the nice twist at the end just peppers a wonderful story  overall. This film is creative, inventive, and wildly funny, and it made my  personal ""Top Ten"" list for 1998. And DVD owners watch out! The  commentary by director Tommy O'Haver absolutely adds to the magic of the  behind the scenes of making this film. Don't miss it!",946857600,8,756,4.8515625
192686,4,1573624365,Sean Hayes is one of the best gay actors out there. This movie was not what I was expecting... It turned out to be better... well done!,946425600,2,135,4.037037037037037
192687,5,1573624365,I have seen this movie a few times and it is a great movie.  Ipersonaly identify with the lead character (Sean Hayes) but even ifyour not gay this is an awesome movie.  Tommy O'Haver (Writer and Director) did a fabulous job with the movie. I searched for this movie for a long time.  This movie will defently be spending a lot of time in my VCR.,945043200,,345,4.196969696969697
192688,5,1573624365,"What I liked best about the film is the inventive way that the story was told using the Poloroid photos (too bad they're not making polaroid film any more! It was such a great medium!) and the main character, (well acted) by Sean P. Hayes, talking to the audience. We all agree that the drag queen sequences are great! Watch the opening credits more than once. And it was really great to hear Petula Clark again. I've screened it for straight and gay friends & all agreed that the film is ""SO SPECIAL"". Great cast, characters, sets, locations and cinematography in addition to just a great entertaining, well written film! A must see fun comedy for the 90's!",944956800,7,658,4.584745762711864
192689,5,1573624365,"Though not a ""Titanic"" success at the box office, I heard this was an audience-pleaser and now, after having seen it, I can understand why. The performances are first-rate (especially the versatile Hayes) and  the plot and characters carry through very nicely to the finish. And after  having seen this underrated gem, I can also understand what all the hoopla  surrounding newcomer Mark Anderson's performance is all about. True, he has  only a few lines and one pivitol scene, but this under-used actor's screen  presence makes an indelible mark (!). A movie-goer with a keen eye for  talent will recognize his potential. Look for more of him in the future!  Big thumbs up for this sweet gem of a flick.",937267200,,705,4.825
192717,5,1573624365,"Great location picks around my hometown of Los Angeles and Catalina Island, whew! I'm proud of it. Very humorous with all the heartbreaks and pains after all the effort a gay person had done to impress a guy who is  not for him. Very typical gay life romance. But what hurts from my point of  view is that not even a one night stand romance happened in this film. Not  even a B.J.! I guess that's the way love hurts in this hilarious comedy.  A  collector's item  for gay viewers.",924739200,,480,4.277777777777778
192718,5,1573624365,"""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" is by far one of the best movies I've seen (Oscar worthy). It is about a twenty something man chasing after his object of affection. The fact that his object of affection just happens  to be male brings to the light that this is a gay oriented movie (As if you  couldn't tell that from the cover, trailers, or movie poster) and something  that few directors have tried to attack as a movie plot. We are introduced  to Billy, played by Will and Grace's Sean P. Hayes, in bed with Fernando,  his bed hopping latino lover. Not one for the promiscuous relationships,  Billy leaves Fernando and to drown his sorrows, goes to a party. Here, he  meets the man of his dreams (Ok, he actually technically met him in a  coffee house, but they never said more than ten words), Gabriel. They hit  it off and Billy asks Gabriel to be his new model in a set of poleroid  shoots. Gabriel agrees and the rest of the movie involves Billy trying to  figure out if Gabriel is gay or not (and Gabriel trying to figure it out  for himself). Along the way, Billy recieves the consultation of fellow  photographer and good friend, Perry, as well as his straight female  roommate George (short for Georgeanna) and a few others. I won't tell you  how it ends, but Billy does get his kiss. A remarkable movie, ""Billy's  Hollywood Screen Kiss"" shows us just how alike homosexuals and  heterosexuals are when it comes to love and gives a down-to-earth view of  the life of a homosexual, without all the clichs and stereotypes. Sean P.  Hayes gives a spectacular performance as Billy, who nothing like Haye's  Jack from Will and Grace. I don't quite understand everyone's fascination  with Mark Anderson's Peter. Everyone is saying what a wonderful actor he  is, when all he says on camera is one line: ""Do you work with  Fernando?""I mean, what kind of acting is that? Anyone can say that,  and though I do admit that he has a few more lines at the beginning,  they're on an answering machine. I don't quite see how this is acting.  Anyway, a first rate movie. I'd give it six out of five stars. If you  missed it in the theater, rent it tonight. Whether straight or gay, a  garanteed hit!",922492800,3,2192,4.5089058524173025

What it did do was showcase a wounderful love story full of  many twist and turns that leaves the viewer with a contented feeling.  Also, it showcased the talents of the two male lead actors, and the writing  brillance of the author.

Billy is a gay photographer who falls in love with a straight (or is he??) guy who works at a coffee shop when he is hired to take his picture.
