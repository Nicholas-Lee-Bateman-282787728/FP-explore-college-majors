8291188,4,B001D26508,"This is a good double feature deal from Tokyo Shock. You get two horror movies from Thailand for the price of one. The first film ""The Commitment"" is ok, I would rate this a 3 star film. Story is good enough to keep you interested, but nothing spectacular as this has all been done many times. A group of girls just graduating from high school makes wishes infront of a shrine that will grant them but not knowing that in return a vengeful ghost will haunt them to there deaths. The second film ""The Unborn"" is the better of the two films. More creepy and based off a true event in Thailand. This film I would rate a 4 star. A bar girl gets beaten by her drug dealer ending up at the hospital. This is when she starts seeing and hearing things not knowing if she is hallucinating from drugs or if there is a true evil presence in the hospital. Overall both movies are good and you get both for under $10.",1360368000,,904,4.2011494252873565
