7831906,5,6302814200,"My love for the Seto Inland Sea in Japan was mirrored by this documentary based on Donald Richie's book of the same name. There is no attempt to film the whole book but rather to create something impressionistic of Richie's journey - a journey that is as much about the discovery of himself as of the place. Nonetheless the place is captured artfully and beautifully and timelessly. Indeed, for anyone seeking something that is akin to the traditional spirit of Japan then this is the best starting point. Donald Richie based his book on several trips that he made during the 1960s. Some forty years later he returned to the area expecting it to have changed but he was surprised to find that little had. Likewise with this film. Shot in 1990, many believe it is a film of Lost Japan - it isn't. Come to the Inland Sea now (2016) and little has has been lost. The place, the people, the customs and traditions are still largely there, though sadly depopulation has taken its toll. However the scrounge of and pollution of industrialisation that worried Richie never took hold and the Inland Sea remains one of the most exquisite places to live and visit. And if you cannot then this film is a worthy substitute.",1470355200,,1211,4.611111111111111
7831907,4,6302814200,over all I'm quite pleased with this purchase. There is some drop in the volume on one or two parts; but basically a good price for this tape,1330992000,,141,4.071428571428571
7831908,5,6302814200,"This is an exquisite, lyrical documentary.  Watching the film is like watching a poem.  It is deliberately paced like most Japanese movies and literature giving it an almost mystical quality.  Parts of the documentary are profound, parts are thoughtful, parts are metaphysical, and some parts (quite a few) are simply whimsical.  The documentary demonstrates many important themes in Japanese culture such as the propensity for adapting and adopting elements from other cultures to suit their needs.  I just finished showing The Inland Sea to a college course I teach on the history of Japan.  After many years, it never ceases to amaze me how this retrospective on the author's book, by the same name, moves my students and me.  The Inland Sea is a beautiful and poignant look at the periphery of modern Japan where, as Donald Richie states, you will find the real Japanese.",1320796800,,875,4.993103448275862
7831909,5,6302814200,"This is what it is like to live in Japan.  I was amazed to see it captured so perfectly on film. The scenery, the pace of life, the day-to-day people and things, everything is at once completely real and yet tinged with nostalgia.  Overlaying this vision is the inner musings of Donald Richie, a man with profound insight on the island nation of Japan, and what it is like to live there as a foreigner. Almost every time, his thoughts were familiar ones, reflections that I myself have had on the sights and people I have seen.

""The Inland Sea"" is a leisurely tour across the Seto Inland Sea, the body of water that separates the island of Shikoku from the main island of Honshu.  Donald Richie reads passages from his acclaimed travel-diary of the same name, published some 30 years earlier.  Retaking this trip as an older man, Richie is nostalgic but still reverent of the lifestyle along this stretch of water.  The images drift across small, perfect islands that look like something from a painting, to elegant coffee shops and covered shopping arcades, to an gorgeous, isolated island where lepers live, playing gateball and waiting to die peacefully.  Everything is authentic.

Richie is also honest with himself in his dialog, sometimes uncomfortably so.  He acknowledges things about being a traveler, such as the sexual freedom that people can find in Japan, without coming off as salacious or exploitative.  It is something that simply is a part of the journey, as much as the occasional loneliness and the awe.

Unlike so many travel guides of Japan, ""The Inland Sea"" does not attempt to highlight the strangeness of Japan, the unfamiliar food and customs.  It does not put forth a ""Japan! Wow!"" tour of the exciting sites and great majesties you can find there.  People looking for that sort of thing will find themselves disappointed by it.  Rather, like a boat gently drifting down a slow river, it shows real people living their real lives, and it does so beautifully.",1114214400,7,1985,4.8
7831910,1,6302814200,"Basically footages of Japan off the usual tourist track and nothing more.  There are still many beatiful towns in Japan today so I don't see how this film captured anything lost or vanishing in Japan.  Besides, its so boring!
 His narration is self centered talking about Japanese culture as if he knows something about it(he doesn't).  He also focuses on women, young japanese women too much making me think that this love affair with Japan is more of a love affair with its women - he stereo types them as docile, submissive and ""made to please man"" types.",1064966400,2,558,4.663265306122449
7831911,1,6302814200,"A prodigiously dull tour through the less-seen islands and coastlands of Japan, narrated by an American expatriate and author who relocated in order to experience ""the real Japan.""  His pompous prose irritates and bores by turns, and is maddeningly self-centered.  He praises uncritically all things Japanese, and castigates the evil West (a familiar, if tiresome theme).  ""Sex makes, in its own way, the ideal souvenir"" is just one of the dubious gems of this skippable travelogue.  Conceivably useful for students of Japanese culture, it is to be hoped that the viewer will exercise more discernment than did the author.  Though my family normally loves travel videos, we voted this one a must-skip for all but the most determined insomniac.",1057622400,3,743,5.2100840336134455
7831912,5,6302814200,"The Inland Sea is a gorgeous and fascinating look at an area of Japan most Westerners know nothing about.  I loved it so much that as soon as it was over, I started it over and watched it again all the way through.",977097600,5,214,3.9767441860465116
7831913,5,6302814200,"Inland Sea is a documentary based on Richie's book of the same name. It transcends this form, however, to become a truly unique vision of one man's love affair with a  Japan that has all but vanished. It is best to see along  with reading the book. It is well worth every penny.",931478400,6,278,4.226415094339623
