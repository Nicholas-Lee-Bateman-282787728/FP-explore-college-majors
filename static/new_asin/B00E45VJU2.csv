5889958,5,B00E45VJU2,"Never mind the religious undertones - I don't, honestly, think that only Roman Catholics hold those 'virtues' of Floria Tosca, et al - and I am a devout Roman Catholic myself.
I originally loathed this production, seeing how gloomy and sparse are the scenary and setting. But I am glad indeed that I eventually obtained this DVD!
The leads are ALL outstanding.
Certainly, Jonas Kaufmann sets a new benchmarking standard for the role of Cavarodossi. He incarnates the role both vocally and physically - he not just 'performed' it. His 'Vittorio! Vittorio!' is fully on par in terms of dramatic outburst and power as Mario del Monaco. Kaufmann simply convinces the audience that he is the new verismo king.
To more or less the same degree, Thomas Hampson also owned the role of Baron Scarpia. While Hampson is never a Verdian baritone and I loath his Germont, et al, I find his debut as Scarpia in this production highly effective and even outstanding. The nuances, the demeanour, they are all there, both vocally and physically. A debonair and evil nobility - in short, a highly convincing portrayal.
With two brilliant male leads, one feels certain apprehension for Emily Magee, the 'new' Tosca to me. But lo, she is more than adequate for the role - blonde and noble in bearing, physically she owned all the attributes of Floria Tosca. The person who remarks about Magee's weight is simply being nasty and nothing else: she is not one jot heavier than Anna Netrebko! And Tosca is no mere girl - more mature than Cavaradossi.
Vocally Emily Magee's timbre isn't really colourful, but her singing is never short of being well-controlled and expressive, and has the right fach for the role - more so than Karita Mattila in that less successful outing at the MET a bit earlier on.
With three solid lead roles as such, this Tosca stands as a clear winner in a modern setting. It is thrilling, it is moving, and it is terse and compelling.",1308096000,2,1933,4.738872403560831
5889959,4,B00E45VJU2,"Mr. Kaufmann here reaffirms his claim to fame as the world's greatest tenor! What can't he sing? Thomas Hampson's interpretation of Scarpia is vigorously brought to life with a brilliant, thoughtful, interpretation. Mannerisms mar Emily Magee's interpretation in the title role.",1307577600,2,278,5.804878048780488
5889960,4,B00E45VJU2,"First things first - this is not a generic production of Tosca....Puccini's stage directions are not followed to the letter and Robert Carsen takes a lot of license with the staging going so far as to set the opera in a completely different place and time from where Puccini wanted. Does this updating of the opera work well in this production??...not particularly. Is this a production still worth watching?? ABSOLUTELY.....due to two brilliant performances and Robert Carsen's successful redefinition of the relationships in the opera.

The PROs:
CAVARADOSSI:
Let me start off by saying I bought this strictly to see Jonas Kaufmann's CAVARADOSSI.  I'm a very big fan of his, I've reviewed some of his other works, I own most of his DVD's and recordings.  He does NOT disappoint here - giving one of the brilliant performances I mentioned earlier.  He's got everything to make him a perfect Cavaradossi - good looks, wonderfully sensitive acting skills, and most importantly a burnished tenor with a clarion top range. His cries of ""Vittoria!  Vittoria!"" are breathtaking and his ""E lucevan le stelle"" is worth the price of the DVD alone.  He makes you BELIEVE in his love for Floria Tosca - how captivating he finds her eyes and how utterly he is in her power.  One clearly senses that he is somewhat younger than Tosca and for him - their love is still rapturously new - still burning brightly and filling all of his senses.  Truly, never has he loved life more. Kaufmann's performance makes Cavaradossi a man apart - a man too noble to be touched by the ugliness of the world surrounding him.

TOSCA:
This was Emily Magee's role debut and she's very good but not outstanding. Her voice is plush at times - the vibrato is a little wide but never to the point of distraction.  Now, I know that Tosca is a diva - she's artistic - somewhat vain and yet there must be something about her that the audience must love, the vulnerability behind the vanity - the fragility behind the strength.  Ms. Magee did not find that special spark that make us forgive Tosca for all her dramatics.  Ms. Magee is just not truly believeable as a lusciously beautiful 1950's Hollywood glamour star that she's trying to play.  She's still a quite serviceable Tosca and one hopes that she'll grow into the role.

SCARPIA:
This is also Thomas Hampson's role debut as SCARPIA and he turns in a BRILLIANT performance.  I was truly mesmerized by him and to be honest, I'm not usually a Thomas Hampson fan. I usually find him a cold, uninvolved, rather boring presence on stage and I usually find his voice to be so-so.  I'm happy to say, I was dead wrong.

Yes, his voice is not black enough to sing this role, it does not have the POWER required to be a truly demonic Scarpia.  But, Hampson is a very intelligent artist, he knows this about his voice, and he adapts his performance accordingly.  This has to be one of the subtlest Scarpia's on DVD - He's sleek, charming, and dangerous.

Hampson plays Scarpia as a man always in control and so when he gets angry...truly angry....it's terrifying. He lets us see how much Scarpia has to work to keep his anger in check - watch for his reaction when he finds that the royalists are defeated at Marengo. It's great!. Hampson's Scarpia is always watching, always lurking - we literally see him spin the web and see his enjoyment as Tosca struggles against his power. Maybe because I wasn't expecting Hampson to be that involved in his performance, I was all the more shocked and impressed at the dramatic range in both his voice and his acting.  Wonderful, wonderful wonderful.

THE MAIN POINT:
This production's Floria Tosca is actually a far more suitable partner to Scarpia than she is to Cavaradossi - the power play between her and Scarpia is the most electrifying relationship of this production and it reverberates through out the three acts while Cavaradossi is treated almost as a civilian casualty - an innocent victim  slain in the power struggle between Tosca and Scarpia.

The isolation of Cavaradossi is brought home by the opening of Act 3 when he's alone on stage abandoned to his death.  In Act 3 - The audience definitely roots for Cavaradossi - we want him to live because we see him for the noble, passionate soul he his but our sympathies strangely end up lying with him alone.  We feel somewhat indifferent to the outcome of partnership between Tosca and Cavaradossi because we've already seen the much more visceral, demanding, intriguing, sexually-charged relationship between Tosca and Scarpia. How Carsen is able to change these seemingly set-in-stone relationships between the main trio of performers is really unique and I think THE major success of this production in the way it is able to redefine the relationships within this opera.

The CONS:
A poor directorial choice was made to have Tosca be more than dramatic - she was histrionic...and she was histrionic ALL the way through the opera. Tosca seems too busy being a DIVA that she does not believably go through the character arc of a proud woman being demoralized to the point of submission and then fighting back  Also in this production, I had a difficult time believing in her TRULY loving Cavaradossi.  She treats him almost more like a conquest - like a tribute to her vanity.  However - this only strengthens the unique attraction/relationship between her and Scarpia so in a way - by undermining the relationship between Tosca and Cavaradossi - Carsen strengthens the connection between Tosca and Scarpia.

The updated sets will also not be for everyone - references in the libretto are made to being in certain places that just fall flat because with the updated sets.....we're no longer in those places.  But I think that if one focuses on the relationships, the power struggles, and the emotions that so excellently brought to life - one definitely knows that this is still TOSCA just with a very unique vision.

CONCLUSION:
4 stars for this DVD.  It is worth buying to see the brilliant performances of Hampson and Kaufmann as Scarpia and Cavaradossi respectively.  The take on the relationships in this opera is new and exciting in an opera that can be VERY difficult to re-define anything.  The leading lady is good but not outstanding.  The tempo starts off slow but builds to a fever pitch of emotion by Act 3.  I defy you not to be moved, entranced, and excited by this production.  C'est tout!",1306368000,52,6419,4.759025270758123
5889961,2,B00E45VJU2,"Honestly, sorry I bought this.  Jonas Kaufmann is seriously magnificent and if that's all you need from an opera named 'Tosca' then charge away with my blessing.  Emily Magee has a great voice and is a fine actress but the things she's called upon to do by the director, as in...lay on the floor, strip down to her slip, etc.  only make her look uncomfortable and aren't flattering to a woman with the extra weight she's carrying. She's especially poorly dressed in Act II and that's inexcusable as far as I'm concerned.  Thomas Hampson is nobody's idea of a Scarpia but, at 12 feet tall he's certainly menacing enough amongst a cast that is hard to reach 5'8"" in heels ( I never realized how short Kaufmann was 'till now ).  As much as I love Robert Carsen's fresh take on so many opera's this one falls completely flat except at the finale of Act I. So, if you can't live without Jonas Kaufmann's latest triumph it's all yours.  If you're looking for a real Tosca....this ain't it.",1305590400,13,983,4.49438202247191
5889962,5,B00E45VJU2,"First, the production: this is not a traditional ""Tosca"". The sets do not reproduce the actual locations specified in Puccini's score. Tosca doesn't sing ""Vissi d'Arte"" from the floor, and Scarpia sarcastically applauds her when she is finished. After she kills the baritone, she doesn't perform Bernhardt's famous stage business (which Puccini specifies and wrote music to accompany). There is no angel atop the Castel Sant'Angelo in Act 3, not even a stylized one. I am fond of traditional productions, and Regietheater for its own sake often annoys me, sometimes enrages me, but this production held me rapt from first to last. Every detail has been thoroughly thought out and *serves the music and the story*. The actors--and they are quite splendid--have been rehearsed thoroughly and each is entirely inside his character in every shot. Although another reviewer feels no one who didn't already know the work could follow the plot, that seems wrong to me--although I know the work so completely from hundreds of hearings and dozens of productions that it's possible that I just wouldn't know if that were true. I loved every moment of this production, which is, to use an overworked word, brilliant. It has a Concept, but it doesn't treat that concept as superior to Puccini's, it rethinks and reimagines this thrice-familiar war horse, and brings it, nostrils flaring, galloping to life.

Kaufmann is the reason I bought the set, of course, and I have no qualms asserting that he is the greatest spinto tenor singing today. In fact, he equals Franco Corelli in this role, which is something I never expected to be able to say. It is not an Italianate sound, but it is beautiful, powerful, even throughout the range, baritonal in the lower mid-range (like Corelli), with a huge, secure, free, ringing top. He can sing piano at any pitch, he produces thrilling dimimuendi at will. He is a complete musican and a commanding, subtle actor. He is a riveting stage animal with movie-star good looks and a great physique. Since I heard Corelli as Cavaradossi in 1968 with Nilsson, and a little later partnering Bumbry's first, ill-advised Tosca, (often self-absorbed on stage, he practically carried Bumbry through the evening) I have not heard any tenor sing the role as well, no exceptions. Kaufmann's place in the grand tradition is already secure. He has everything.

I have not always been a fan of Thomas Hampson in Verdi and heavier repertoire; here he is the perfect Scarpia, the voice a little underpowered at the bottom (many bass-baritones and even a few basses sing Scarpia) and without the idiomatic snarl of Gobbi, but he is entirely in command of every vocal and dramatic requirement of the part, and for perhaps the very first time in my experience, I found myself chilled by the character, actually loathing him--not just the idea of Scarpia, but his very incarnation. This is operatic acting--no, just Acting--of the very highest order. It may be Hampson's finest work ever, his instrument entirely intact, his always-impeccable musicianship constantly underpinning his every intention. He is in a state of grace from his first entrance. He takes big chances, and he can do no wrong.

Emily Magee is a singer I have not heard before, and I expected her to be somewhat outclassed, but instead she does the impossible and creates a Tosca whose ability to inspire her Cavaradossi and her Scarpia are never in doubt. The voice has not so much ""face"" as many other exponents of the part, but she is equal to all the role's demands, has excellent presence and delivers beautfully detailed singing and acting. For me, she is a major find.

Every small role is taken with the kind of panache one expects to encounter in a Broadway production and seldom gets in opera--Scarpia's thugs seem to have stepped right out of the evening news. In short, this is a sensational production of a great opera in an intelligent, involving and thought-provoking, scenically appropriate performance which delivers real thrills (the kind that raise the hair on the back of your neck). I watched in one sitting and I will watch it again soon. This is why I go to the opera.",1303862400,12,4165,4.920341394025605
5889963,5,B00E45VJU2,"Opera goers and DVD collectors for whom the Zefferelli Met Tosca was the ideal, this production of Tosca from Zurich is one that should be avoided. At no point does it resemble any Tosca I have ever seen. An unpainted brick wall would appear to be a leitmotiv and Robert Carsen has devised a play within a play structure which is discussed in the accompanying booklet. My acquaintance with the music goes back many years--back to the 78's, an RCA set with Gigli and Caniglia. I was a teenage and I thought the tenor was glorious. As I grew older my love affair dimmed; the soprano had distinct pitch problems which I found made listening more than problematic. My love affair with the opera was rescued in 1953, the year the Callas recording was released. I would like to say that my ardor for the opera continued unabated to this day, but such familiarity did breed something akin to boredom with the music. Only one other soprano was able to rescue me from ennui with the music--Kabaivanska and she was not as lucky as Callas was with her colleagues. She did make a film which I believe has since made it to DVD but it is lip synched which I find very off putting and while I did watch it on PBS I had no interest in owning it.

I have great admiration for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann; indeed he was the reason I decided to purchase this DVD. He did not disappoint. Indeed he has lavished his intelligence, voice and musicianship on the role of Cavaradossi to the same degree as his Werther, Lohengrin, Don Jose and Florestan (I should also add the Berlioz Faust).I can say that I have never heard the role sung with such artistry. No, the voice is not Italian so one cannot expect to hear echoes of the Mediterranean; I for one couldn't care less based on what Italy has been providing for the world's opera stages. Not only does he bring artistry, but fortune has truly smiled on this man: he is lucky enought to be good looking and he can act. You can add to this his extraordinary facility with languages.

In the last few years Thomas Hampson has been lending his artistry and musicianship to roles that one would have though he was unwise to sing. When he released a CD of Verdi arias, the Opera Quarterly critic simply stated that he was no Verdi baritone and then proceeded to savage the set. Well, yes, he isn't a Verdi baritone but his Rodrigue in the Chatelet production of Don Carlo is superb. His Macbeth from Zurich is not going to make converts but it is intelligent, well sung and superbly acted. Madriyka? Well, it was a signature role for
Fischer-Dieskau who was also a lyric baritone and it it didn't spell disaster for the great Lieder singer. Hampson (courtesy of boot leg performances and YouTube)also sang Mandryka and proved that he is a canny singer who knows what his voice is capable of and to avoid the pitfalls that can wreak havoc to a singer when he steps outside what conventional wisdom describes as his area of expertise. Scarpia is a big juicy baritone role, ideal for Gobbi and Taddei and a host of other famous baritones. Hampson doesn't even attempt to emulate his predecessors but relies on technique, acting and an interpretation that is ideal in this production. I find him an excellent Scarpia, fulfilling all the needs of the role.

And what of our titular heroine? Magee is a soprano whose career has been based more in Europe although recently she sang Elsa iin Chicago. She is an interesting artist would seem to be more at home with Strauss and Wagner (not Brunhilde or Isolde I hasten to add, but the lyric, lighter roles). Like most non-Italians she does not have chest tones that are essential to the verismo rep. Nor does she have the temperament that would make her an ideal Tosca, and in truth, the voice is somewhat generic in that there is no instantly definable color to her voice that makes it identifiable after the first note has sounded. But she has clearly entered into the role with great commmitment and she sings it well--certainly a more perferable Tosca than Matilla and others who have been singing the role. Cedolins and Dessi may have the Italian temperament but Magee has the artistry and better musianship.

Is this the Tosca to buy? One will have to order up their priorities. I have made mine and this is a Tosca that I will play, perhaps not as often as when I was fifteen (I also had few opera in my collection at the time) but return to it I will.",1303603200,23,4422,4.5099750623441395
5889964,3,B00E45VJU2,"I purchased this performance on the merits of Jonas Kauffman, but I found Robert Carsen's concept an insurmountable and irritating obstacle.  I could listen to this performance, but I can't stand watching it.  Puccini's opera is so Roman and so Catholic--even if critically so--that to make no visual reference even to a church or a procession in the San Andrea del Valle act renders it senseless. Where was the ""Madonna al manto"" to which Tosca "" diedi su gioielli""?  And of course Mario's painting of Mary Magdalen has to be bare-breasted.  I guess Luc Bondi set the standard at the Met.  For this reason I give this DVD only three stars, and they are for the singers and orchestra.  Mr. Carsen, you get a lump of coal in your stocking!",1303516800,25,738,4.638461538461539
5889965,5,B00E45VJU2,"I won't waste much time discussing this quite problematic stage production seen in the Zrich Opera House. Robert Carsen is well known by now for his ""original"" ideas. He is not always wrong and in some instances, even in this Tosca, illuminates aspects of the story as never before. But his vision of a kind of theatrical Tosca within a Tosca pretty soon descends into sheer silliness. We have a prosceniun arch on the stage most of the times -gone are the church, Palazzo Farnese and Castel Sant'Angelo- and everything seems to go around a grand diva of the theatre, a kind of glamorous celebrity only worried about her own persona. One could argue that in many ways that is the Tosca envisioned by Puccini. But nobody without a previous knowledge of the story, having seen another more ""conventional"" staging, would have a clue about what's going on here. This is a Tosca that is elevated towards heaven in her own Te Deum and a Tosca that commits suicide throwing herself to the orchestral pit imagined at the back of the stage. Go figure. Thank God we have Jonas Kaufmann, a true wonder, the greatest Cavaradossi I have ever encountered, live or on record, with the ringing healhy tone of a Corelli and a tender mezzavoce and piano phrasing that brings memories of the best Carreras and only by himself could save the occasion and make this night truly unforgettable. He is also a great actor, someone that seems to live each role he takes. The result in this instance is almost miraculous. Thomas Hampson creates a suave and elegant Scarpia, perhaps more terrifying because of that than the usual truculent fiend, and is quite believable as a character. I don't think it challenges Tito Gobbi vocally, but his is nevertheless a substantial interpretation. I didn't know American soprano Emily Magee, but I should have. She exhibits a good voice and is dramatically involved, creating in her first attempt a serviceable Tosca, without being truly memorable. Unfortunately, and although this probably wasn't a problem in the opera house, to the unforgiving scrutiny of the video camera she doesn't look nearly as attractive as her very handsome Cavaradossi or her refined Scarpia. She is a good-looking mature woman and I would hate to sound unkind, but she does not fit the bill for Carsen's vision of Tosca as the ultimate glamorous goddess, a sort of Ava Gardner of the stage. And to my mind this in not a minor quibble in a production in which even the bishops kneel in front of her. Garignani conducts without bringing much attention to the orchestra. But this is the tenor's hour. You have to have it just because of Kaufmann's Cavaradossi. Now, I need to see him in an unoriginal staging, one in which I am not continually distracted from his moving rendering by production's whims.",1302480000,55,2792,4.7946058091286305

The wondrously soft contemplative start that peaks to full glorious voice as he remembers Tosca's embrace captures Mario as no other tenor I've heard including Domingo.

The singers are exceptionally good, and they are quite good actors. The real ""scene"" is the struggle between the three main protagonists. Second and third act are almost bare stages. The success is due to the singers who with their voices and acting create the real melodrama. In fact, this production brought to me more of the main characters than traditional ones (I have seen quite a few).  Interviews with the singers and stage director would have been a plus. Worth watching with an open mind.",1325376000,3,736,4.705426356589148
5889975,4,B00E45VJU2,"Often, the success or failure of Tosca depends on whether or not the production's Scarpia is sufficiently evil and cruel to build the tension for the audience to hate him. I could not imagine Thomas Hampson as mean enough to succeed in having an audience hate him. But Hampson is brilliant as Scarpia, his hair slicked back, and wearing his coat as if donning the cape of a Mafia ""don."" His singing and acting are also quite convincing. Watch for the disgust he shows, as he glowers at a forkful of food, annoyed that Cavaradossi's torture has disturbed his supper.

Jonas Kaufmann is one of the most believable Cavaradossis in years. He's younger, convincingly in love with Tosca, and also a credible patriot, willing to risk or lose his life for the rebel, Angelotti. His singing is gorgeous, and he puts across a courageous Cavaradossi while at times still showing vulnerability in his exchanges with Tosca.

Emily Magee's Tosca is not one of my favorites, but it's not her fault so much as that of Robert Carsen who apparently made the decision to emphasize Tosca the prima donna, instead of allowing her to also be Tosca the woman. She appears to be overly dramatic--forced to play a spoiled actress, without the balance of being also a woman in love. Carsen seems also to have decided to deemphasize Tosca's religious conflicts regarding sex and murder. He's even staged the expected church scenes in a sparse layout more reminiscent of a movie theater. Yes, weight wise, Magee is one of the heavier Toscas in the past few decades, but a greater liability than her weight is the determination to portray her as a prima donna with all the exaggerations that ride with it. It makes it harder for the audience to identify with Tosca as a woman tortured between love, her career, and her religious upbringing. They deprive her of her humanity, turning her into an over-acting actress (again, NOT Emily Magee's fault!)

It is still an exciting and dramatic Tosca that I will enjoy seeing again. But it's the dynamic energy of Kaufmann and Hampson, both in singing and acting that carries the day. They are what make this Tosca work!",1311552000,9,2133,4.7594594594594595

Still, Olivero's Tosca will never be surpassed, needless to say, but Magee's is arguably the best Tosca nowadays. Hampson's voice is a bit too light for Scarpia, but even so he's fantastic, really disturbing. This is a production by Robert Carsen shot in Zurich, smart and beautiful as most of his, although not among his very best. Do not expect a traditional one, of course, and, if you are a fan of old-fashioned cardboard productions, you will probably think that ""not even Robert Carsen can spoiil this Tosca"".

8600908,4,B00E45VJU2,"I enjoyed this video, but I would rather have it as a CD.  I think all of the singers were excellent; I really can't fault anyone.  The production concept is very interesting, but apparently executed with an extremely low budget.  To create the chuch, they simply put several rows of chairs on the stage, and Cavaradossi's painting is a mural on the stage right wall.  For Scarpia's room, there is simply a desk and a chair.  For the third act, the stage is literally bare.  I think bare stage can work if the costumes are striking, but these are very simple.  Tosca's dresses are beautiful but very plain.  I don't insist that operas realize the locations completely literally, but it would be nice to have something interesting to look at.",1425772800,2,741,4.6461538461538465

fled is that hour...
and desperately I die.
And never before have I loved life so much!

Oh the pain and beauty of that aria as Mario sings his letter to Tosca who has the false hope of deliverance.  Love, happiness and petty jealousy are caught up in evil politics and power.  The depth and beauty of this opera has become an endearing favorite for me and Jonas Kaufmann is a tremendous Mario as Emily Magee a Tosca.  Scarpia is dressed in a pinstriped suit rather than the Church/royal regalia, yet Thomas Hampson plays the ultimate hedonist sociopath who uses and discards people at his whim.  This production by the Met is outstanding.",1417392000,4,683,4.6115702479338845
8600910,5,B00E45VJU2,"I am not a music major, or opera fan.  However, this version of Tosca is something to definitely see.  Often, I buy a dvd and play it once, and never again.  This opera I have seen a few times, and each time I enjoy it.

Great performance, in my humble opinion.",1412985600,,261,4.0588235294117645
8600911,5,B00E45VJU2,"I bought this Tosca at the same time I purchased the new were Covent Garden one also with Kaufman to see what changes have happened to him over the past few years and how he had grown. As it turns out this production is far superior to the Covent Garden one with Gheorghiu, Kaufmann and Tervel. Even though Kaufmann is not a spinto, he can manage this role, with allowances. For the most part he is still using his singing voice in most of his phrases. By the time he gets to Covent Garden he's relying on triple forte for the last half of way too many phrases. That's not good singing and it's not good communication.
He sings most of this beautifully, it's unfortunate for him then the stardom and money is not to be found in Wagner Strauss and leader these days.
Thomas have some has a beautiful voice that is used most intelligent lady and is many years singing leader show through here very clearly. He knows how to sing with an orchestra to let the orchestra take the lead, then take over again. He is one of the most intelligent and amoral Scorpias that I have experienced, and his characterization is fascinating. He may not war loudly but the look in his eyes is is deadly as the most ferocious predator. At ROHCG, Terfel plays Scarpia as a psycho, which I found repulsive and uninteresting.
At first I thought Emily McGee was a bit too over-the-top, but she is both superb as a singer and actress and proved her point. She constantly displayed strengths personality and ego and proves a worthy opponent to Scorpia. She also sings the role for all it's worth, and uses the shape of her mouth her body her cost you all of her dramatic assets to create a really memorable character.
I did have some quibbles with the direction of Robert Carson here, but the excellence of the singing and acting simply blows those considerations away for me - there was nothing that was so obtrusive as to bother me. The traditional ROHCG set certainly didn't make up for the poor singing.
While I was watching these two Toscas I was also watching another pair, both of which are recommended: a wonderful Tosca on Dynamic that is done with a theatrical feeling; still fully sung, but while singing the actors went about their business and ignored the audience. There was more physicality between Tosca and Scarpia: she wrestles with him and then he virtually picks her up and throws her onto a bit before she sings Vissi d'Arte. As his men are carrying Mario out of the room she is holding on to Mario's leg and gets dragged halfway across the stage. the lighting, costumes and sets are stunning and this production definitely deserves to be seen. It resets the context for more fully operatic productions.
I also watched the new Blu-ray of the Dessi/Armiliato/Sgura Tosca and they were all excellent although Armiliato tends to jump to triple forte too quickly. Claudio Sgura reminded me so much of a modern Gobbi, and the whole production was very evocative of the Callas/Gobbi ""64 Covent Garden performance. I hope we'll see much more of him.",1410825600,3,3035,4.601476014760148
