8283116,4,B00006HAY6,This is fun for Bernadette Peters fans.  It is a glimpse into her past performances and her beautiful voice is entrancing.  I would recommend this to Bernadette Peters fans but not anyone else.,1067385600,2,193,4.818181818181818
8283117,1,B00006HAY6,"This DVD is a great disappointment. Not only are the picture and sound qualities abysmal, Bernadette and her stage act are equally poor. The end credits indicate that the show is from 1979, so I don't know how well that fits into Bernadette's career development.
Her greatest fans will only cringe on seeing such an embarrassingly poor performance. Sadly too, it transpires that the arranger and conductor was the late and very great Peter Matz which adds to the disappointment!",1035072000,7,478,4.9875
