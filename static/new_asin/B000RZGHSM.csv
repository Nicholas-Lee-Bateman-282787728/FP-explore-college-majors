a Port Authority cop (New York.)  The first and third movies are family emotional. Snake Eyes, the second movie shows a calculated assassination in a boxing stadium.  It is also quite emotional towards the end when the detective finds out his best friend is the one behind this murder plot.

Happy ending on each movie.  Good guy survives.",1485388800,,483,4.841463414634147

8203270,3,B000RZGHSM,"I like some of Nicolas Cage's work. That is because he can be quite a fine comedian. For the heavier roles, though, especially those in ""action films"" which entirely comprise the kind on this collection, Cage has many rivals among actors who fare better with such parts. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of action films except for certain, undeniably good ones (starring the likes of Al Pacino, for example, or even Colin Farrell). As for including on this DVD the potboiler, ""World Trade Center"", even when that film was made, it seemed to be merely, obviously and odiously, a 9-11 propaganda piece; many people even at the point at which that motion picture was made already were aware of more likely accounts of what really happened at, and to, those Twin Towers.

The three films that I would have selected would be ""Raising Arizona"", a very endearing comedy, indeed, as well as ""Valley Girl"" and ""Trapped in Paradise"". They are from early, or relatively so, in Cage's career, when he was both inclined to do comedy and was, quite convincingly, a ruggedly macho young lover; Cage should have remained on the path of hilarity! For a DVD collection of Cage's films, however, which does exist, there is a good compilation, also titled ""Nicolas Gage Collection"", which appears on a 4-disc DVD set on the M.G.M. label and an alternative from M.G.M. gets three of those four films, excluding ""Valley Girl"", onto a single DVD. That 4-discs includes, mostly, some cherishable comic films starring Cage, namely, besides ""Valley Girl"" (already mentioned),  also ""Honeymoon in Vegas"", ""Leaving Las Vegas"", and ""Moonstruck"". Many others, though, won't agree with me and truly will savour, above all, Nicholas Cage's action films, more than I ever would do so. The set under review is the one for them.",1389657600,,1791,4.8881578947368425
