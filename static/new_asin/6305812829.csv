8194822,5,6305812829,"These three episodes lay the groundwork for season 2 of ""Trigun,"" both in terms of tone and plotting.  'Eascape from Pain', episode 11, initially resembles ""Quick Draw"", a light, self-contained romp.  The writers use the plot, however, to further delineate each character.  Vash and company are individually drawn into a complex moral dilemma.  Each character finds themselves weighing the good of the individual against the good of the many, and making a decision.  The decisions reached by each of the principals, while seeking the same outcome, are very different.  And the scene where Wolfwood puts a gun to his own temple will not easily be forgotten.  All in all, a complex, ambitious episode that poses questions not often raised in anime.  The standout episode of season 1.
Episode 12, ""Diablo"", features the return of Legato Bluesummers, as well as introducing the first of Vash's season 2 adversaries, the Gung-Ho Guns.  This marks the evolution of ""Trigun"" from a humor series with serious moments to a character-driven drama with the occasional light-hearted moment.  Most of the episodes that follow are completely serious, darker, and more ambitious.  Even the villians become darker.  Though no less bizarre, the Gung-Ho Guns exude more menace than, say, the Nebraska family.
The last episode in this collection, ""Vash the Stampede"", closes out season one with an episode that is mostly a recap of the preceding episodes.  A good jumping-on point for newcomers, though the episode does delve further into Vash's mysterious past and background.",1056844800,,1558,5.233870967741935
8194823,5,6305812829,"Or maybe not-so-surprising. I mean, I knew there was SOMETHING dark lurking around; Vash's trippy dream sequences about Rem are proof enough of that. The fact that episode 12 was almost completely serious (except for the priceless dodgeball scene and Milly's cryptic reference to muffins) didn't totally throw me; still, I was amazed at just HOW serious it could be. Death, destruction, a completely frightening villain with a penchant for hotdogs and a sexy voice (I love Seki Toshihiko)... and Vash getting Really Really [upset]. Wow. The first episode on this tape is also good (it features Wolfwood and pudding - did that come out wrong?) and the last is one of the most worthwhile recap episodes I've ever seen, not only because we get to see Vash shirtless, but because it actually brings up little things that happened in earlier episodes which I'd completely forgotten about. Still, episode 12, aptly titled ""Diablo"", is reason enough for purchasing this volume. If you've written the series off as being just goofy slapstick, this one'll be sure to change your mind.",976406400,4,1075,5.011173184357542
8194824,4,6305812829,"Wanna' see Vash really pissed? Wanna' see just what exactly he's hiding in that left arm? Wanna' see what he looks like under the jacket? Then snatch up this tape. This video gives a little more insight as to what Vashes powers are, and what he's capable of. Don't be discouraged by the third episodes recapping of the past 3 videos, it's all worth it in the end. This isn't the place to start collecting the series, but it does clarify some things. I would've given it 5 stars, but there was a lot of talking this time around, but the 2nd episode makes up for it. Most certainly a good buy.",970963200,,591,4.285714285714286
