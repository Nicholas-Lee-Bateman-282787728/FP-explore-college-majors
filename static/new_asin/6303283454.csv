621257,5,6303283454,"Not since robotic cowboys strutted the dusty streets of Westworld has a sci-fi western caused such a ruckus! Oblivion's a rough and tumble frontier outpost with all sorts of bizarre creatures wandering about. But when Redeye (half man, half lizard and all mean) swaggers into town, all hell breaks loose!
Featuring a posse of favorites including Julie Newmar as the racy saloon hostess, George Takei as the tipsy local ""Doc,"" Carel Struycken (The Addams Family) as an eerie mortician and Meg Foster playing a robocop with a quick draw and a heart of gold-plate.",1024790400,12,561,4.9787234042553195
621258,1,6303283454,"After a town's marshall is killed by the local baddie, the marshall's son rides back to his old hometown. Along with his new found Native friend and an injured deputy, the marshall's son has a few run-ins with the villains (who are after the local precious metal), which leads to a showdown in the desert. Straight-forward Western plot, right? Wrong, since the film takes place on an alien planet, the deputy is a cyborg, and the villain looks like a human snake.
This idea probably looked great on paper to the, count 'em, FIVE different writers credited on the project, but this does not work for the same reason as ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai..."" did not work- the laughs just are not there. Not only is this film not funny, it is eye rollingly not funny. My preschool age son comes home from daycare with funnier jokes than those here.
The cast includes some known names like Julie Newmar, Meg Foster, Carel Struycken, Isaac Hayes, and ""Star Trek""'s George Takei. I hereby declare a moratorium on all former ""Star Trek"" cast members complaining about what an albatross being on that show was- how they were forever typecast, and how unhappy they were being on a network TV show. Takei, who was very good in ""Prisoners of the Sun,"" plays a drunk doctor who says many of the signature ""Star Trek"" lines. Your college roommate doing ""Star Trek"" impressions was not funny, and neither is Takei. Former Catwoman Newmar acts like a cat in her opening scenes as a madame named Miss Kitty (get it? get it?), but then the writers and directors forget to tell her to continue the schtick. Foster looks stunned that her agent fooled her into this.
The script has the setting like the Wild West, but with science fiction twists that continually call attention to themselves by elbowing you in the ribs and pointing. Look, they have an ATM machine! Look, gold is worthless! Look, they have ceiling fans outside! The result is an overly cute idea that never pans out, and this is not helped by bored direction and locations. Look, the undertaker's building is shaped like a coffin! This should have been a straight science fiction western, or a straight over the top comedy. Mixing all these genres makes one huge wrong and no right. And hunker down for the sequel, if you dare. I cannot recommend the oblivious ""Oblivion.""

The film is very cheesy and campy and gets its humor from the era commercials and previous roles of the actors. Julie Newmar who once played Catwoman was Miss Kitty. George Takei has lines from STAR TREK such as ""Great Scottie"" and ""Jim, Beam me up."" Carel Struycken who played Lurch, plays an undertaker. A couple of the actors were in the TV series SUPER FORCE where the main character was Zach Stone. In this film the main character is Zack Stone.

621588,3,6303283454,"So, what to say about a film like Oblivion. Well, you have to understand that this is a B-movie - very definitely so. As such you cannot compare it to bigger budget marvels; this review tries to take this into account and judge the film accordingly.

Oblivion is a cheap movie, with obviously flat-board buildings (painted on windows and all) and no-body actors (with 2-3 established B-movie stars). It is way overplayed, exactly like you'd expect from a B-movie. Actually, it isn't all badly played; some of it is more like theatrical overplaying, and works fine enough. Especially some of the physical acting is decent. (Although some of the actors are bloody awful!).

Oblivion is a cheeeeesy movie, no doubt about that. The moral is black & white, and the plot is straight, reminding one of low-cost TV serials and some 80s movies.

It is much more western than space, full of cowboys and indians clichs; in fact, Oblivion is a western movie with only a handful of space gadgets and aliens scattered about. At one point there is a stop-motion monster, which, weirdly enough, feels a bit fresh in this day and age - or possibly it was just a feeling of melancholy that made the monster seem cute.

All that said the film is not very good. The pacing is slow and erratic, and for such a simple plot there is a lot of exposition scenes where people explain to each other what is going on. Sound and picture quality isn't good. The jokes are poorly executed and not funny. The action is run-of-the-mill and clichs abound. Several characters are damn annoying (mostly because of being overplayed). There are few surprises and you pretty much know where things are heading from the start.

I give the movie 3 stars, with the understanding that it is a 3 star B-movie (if you compare it to an A-movie it probably deserves somewhere between 1 and 1.5 stars). There are B-movies out there a lot worse than this - Hell, there are A-movies out there less enjoyable - but Oblivion really isn't a film I'd recommend to anyone but the absolute SciFi nuts who needs to see/own them all. If you want to watch a really first class SciFi B-movie, you should go and buy ""Hunter Pray"" right away!",1343088000,,2180,4.608247422680412

621640,5,6303283454,"I'd never heard of this movie, it popped up in my recommendations on Amazon.  Being a curious sort, and always living in the hope of finding movies to collect for future viewings, I decided to give it a chance (learning that Julie Newmar was in the cast was the deciding factor).
I was more than pleasantly surprised (they had me with the streetlights/fans/girders): loved the art direction/set design.  Filled with in-jokes of the hit or miss variety (some brought out a laugh, some were groans), this was a standard plot for Westerns.  The prodigal son reluctantly returns to his home town and he's not warmly welcomed by the residents.  That alone wouldn't have been enough to hold my interest, it was the rest, the odd bits that popped up now and then, that made me enjoy this romp through the wild west (after taking a turn through The Twilight Zone first).
Loved most of the characters but especially Julie Newmar as Miss Kitty and Meg Foster as Stell Barr.  The only two clinkers in the cast were Musetta Vander as Lash and George Takei as Doc Valentine (trading on his time with Star Trek).  They crossed too far over the line and went from being caricatures to just plain grotesque.  The problem with this type of humor is that it works, because everyone is in on the joke, or it doesn't, because it misses being funny by a smile.  ""Jim....Beam me up.""  Or the Bingo sequence during a funeral, funny once, but they just wouldn't let it go.  That's the only fault I could find with this piece; knowing and not knowing when to let a joke settle in on its own.

621645,3,6303283454,"Several years ago, I remember watching a VHS enjoying my beverage and eating my popcorn as I watched through the previews.  On this particular movie (I don't remember what it was), there were trailers for several films that I had never heard of before.  One of them was for OBLIVION.  I don't know why, but I found the trailer for OBLIVION to be hilarious and decided that if I ever had an opportunity to rent the movie, then I would.  It took me almost a decade to locate a place that had the movie to rent, but now I've finally watched the movie whose trailer I found so humorous and intriguing all those years before.

OBLIVION is set over two thousand years in the future on a barren planet that is reminiscent of the Western landscapes of the United States.  In fact, not only does the landscape remind one of the American wild west, so do the way people live and how they behave.  For instance, mining is popular occupation of spectators, gunfights are common, and horses are a relatively common form of transportation.  However, despite the similarities, there are also a lot of differences, e.g. the bank has an ATM; there are spaceships; the outback is populated my giant, ferocious, flesh-eating scorpions; and one of the chief villains is a humanoid reptile from another planet.

The story begins with a shootout between the Marshall of Oblivion (Mike Genovese) and the power-hungry lizard-man, Redeye (Andrew Divoff).  Redeye has set a trap for Marshall Stone and Marshall Stone falls for it.  With his death, Redeye takes over the town of Oblivion and begins turning the place into his home base for his various illegal activities.  News of Marshall Stone's death reaches his only son, Zach (Richard Joseph Paul) who is working in the Outback mining for the highly precious metal dreconian.  Zach heads back to Oblivion with a native he rescued from death and Oblivion's funeral master.  Zach has no intention of getting even for his father's murder, but when he gets to Oblivion and sees how much damage is being caused by no one standing up, he decides to take control and bring law and order back to town.

As far as films go, OBLIVION really isn't terrible.  The story is a typical Western-type story, but the production values are fairly decent.

The movie does have a very campy feel to it, however.  This is because of two major reasons.  To begin with, the film doesn't follow the pattern of any one genre.  The movie is most like a Western, but it's not like any other Western I've ever seen.  There's lots and lots of comedy, including dumb one-liners and off-beat visual effects, e.g. the funeral home looks like a casket and there are overhead fans outside.  There's elements of sci-fi with the alien bad guy, the power metal of dreconian, and the giant scorpions.  There's a little bit of gore, romance, and even some innuendo of bondage.  The movie seems to start off wanting to be a straight action piece, then shifts gears into high comedy, before ending in the action genre again.  The other reason for the campiness is the unusual well-known B-movie cast secondary stars.  Julie Newmar (who played Catwoman in the 1960s BATMAN tv series) is dressed in a skintight cat costume portraying a woman named Miss Kitty who has some feline attributes and runs the local saloon, George Takei portrays the local doctor/inventor, Doc Valentine, and constantly says lines directly ripped from STAR TREK,  Isaac Hayes plays a tavern/pawn-shop owner named Buster who has a soft and squeaky voice, and Carel Struycken (famous for Lurch on THE ADDAMS FAMILY movies) plays the funeral director and undertaker Gaunt.  There are several other performers who parody other roles they have played which provide for some laughs, but is also something that becomes dry after awhile.

Overall, OBLIVION isn't a terrible movie and if you don't mind the camp-factor, then it can provide for a relatively fun ninety minutes of cheesy entertainment.",1209859200,6,3951,4.820474777448071

621647,3,6303283454,"Oblivion is a campy, fun loving Sci-Fi Western movie that doesn't try to explain itself, nor does it take itself too seriously.  If you are a trekky like me, its almost worth the cost of the DVD just to hear George Takei (who plays a drunk doctor) pay hommage to ""Bones"" McKoy with such wonderful lines as ""I'm a doctor dammit, not a magician!""  Oblivion has all the stuff you would expect in a B-movie western, including the wooden hero with a problematic past, the nasty villain with a band of losers, the hostage, and the shootout.  This is combined with the sci-fi laser guns and bizarre B-grade off-world creatures.
This movie has all sorts of weird scenes.  The best without question (also worth the price of the movie) has to be the funeral scene with the simultaneous Bingo game taking place on the second floor.  This hilarious combination of sappy funeral speeches with bingo announcements like ""B-1"" going on in the background is a scream.
And while this movie has a really hot black nylon chick in Musetta Vander (if you're into the Trinity ""Matrix"" look, get this!), it is truly missing the gratuitous T&A.  Musetta (the hot siren from ""O Brother Where Art Thou"") is hot though, so the movie still survives.
I give it 3 stars on the B-movie scale - T&A would have brought it to a solid 4.",1057104000,3,1301,4.562231759656652
621648,4,6303283454,"I love this movie...  I first saw it eight years ago and only recently hunted it (and its sequel, Backlash) down as an exorbitantly-priced VHS, even though it meant playing it on a tiny, tinny-sounding TV/VCR.
So, it's a ""Sci-Fi Western.""  Let me see...  Was it hokey?  Heck, yeah!  That's what MAKES the movie.  Basically, toss Clash of the Titans, the original Star Trek series, The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the Eighth Dimension, and a little Jim Henson puppetry into a blender, and you've got a fairly representative perception of what it's like.  I have no idea what the budget was, but what it looks like is NOT mainstream Hollywood, NOT trendy-Indie, but very hip and quirky and campy on a well-designed shoestring budget.
The characters are waaay over the top...  waaay waaay OVER over the top...  even the seemingly straight-played parts by Richard Joseph Paul and Jackie Swanson (Little House on the Prairie really was this tragic, it just wasn't meant to be).  And YES, George Takei pokes fun at his Star Trek pigeonholing with wincingly blatant one-liners, but it's so FUN to see him cutting loose (Sulu was awfully straight-laced).  Musetta Vander is absolutely DELICIOUS as the black leather-clad, electric whip-wielding Lash.  If you've always had a soft spot for really wicked women (with a Bettie Page thing going), you'll fall for her after seeing this.  Carel Struycken is so freaking cool, I want to hug him.  His voice (I sooo dig his voice) and kind of innocent savant demeanor (but with bits of cold practicality peeking through) reminded me of Andre the Giant in The Princess Bride.

7843108,3,6303283454,"Usually I like serious movies. I thought this sounded like a good serious science fiction movie, instead it was a part parody, part silly and part serious. I didn't like the way it started out and almost stopped watching it. Kind of silly and it reminded me of a spoof movie. Maybe that was what was intended. If so they didn't miss the mark by far. As I got into about a third of it I thought why not, I've seen worse and it was kind of starting to grow on me. It did get better as it went along and by the end I found it to be ok. Not what I really like with science fiction but ok none the less.",1500595200,,598,3.869918699186992
