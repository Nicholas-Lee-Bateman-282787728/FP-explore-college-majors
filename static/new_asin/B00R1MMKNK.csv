8693690,5,B00R1MMKNK,"A strange situation, or maybe two strange situations. On one side a peeping-tom voyeur who uses modern technology to get inside the bedroom and the bed of two people who are going to have casual sex, the man having been guided step by step into the situation and into this end by the voyeur and his audience. But unluckily the woman is different and for her, this sex episode has to be the full and final contact with the man she has selected, and thus sex for her is death for both.

The voyeur did not report the crime and thus is in custody pending some sentencing.

On the other hand, a young man discovers by accident his wife is pregnant. She declares she wants to get rid of the child. He refuses. She uses some advanced technology to block him for her. Both cannot have any contact at all until she lifts the blockage. But she dies in a car accident, leaving the child behind in the hands of her father.

The supposed estranged father is no longer blocked and he can approach the child. He discovers the child is not his, but that of an Asian friend of the family. Out of rage he kills the father and abandons the child who dies in the cold outside when she leaves the house. The man is imprisoned and the victim of a sentence that blocks him in the fathers house, the child dead outside in the snow, but he refuses to confess and there are no witnesses.

The police use the great competence of the voyeur to project himself into the house and lead the man to confess his crimes. He is condemned to spend an eternity in this house with blaring Christmas music, each one of the real-time minutes is experienced as if it were five years long.

The voyeur as for him is free but he is blocked by everyone and is thus condemned to have no contact whatsoever with any human. Tomorrow technology is leading us to the worst possible enslavement to the police, the state and some kind of fatalistic future. To get some pleasure and adventure you have to break the law. There is no escape: it will be known sooner or later and then you will be turned into some kind of virtual being going through some unimaginable torture. Welcome to hell on earth and in prison.

8693692,5,B00R1MMKNK,"If you're a sci-fi fan who hasn't yet checked out Black Mirror, you are really missing out. British TV shows again that they are producing some of the best stuff to be seen---the acting, production, and (yes!) storylines are superior. Each episode of the series can stand on its own, but there are some nice common threads touched on if you do watch in order. You will recognize many familiar faces here, Americans and Brits both, really fun to see some of these actors in very different roles than their usual.

""White Christmas"" is one of my favorite episodes, and it gives a very good sense of the series. Jon Hamm is a feature here, and he takes us through 3 interlinked storylines that are all great in their own way. All of the futuristic computing action seems pretty sensible, and the special effects are vivid but reasonable. Look around right now and you can see people with their devices who would probably be right on board with some of the technological ""advances"" seen in Black Mirror.

Let's face it, ""crazy"" science fiction isn't that frightening: it requires too much suspension of disbelief. This type of science fiction is disturbing precisely because it's not that far-fetched at all. With completely variable stories and casts for each episode, Black Mirror could continue to deliver great entertainment for a long time.",1479081600,,1341,4.851528384279476
8693693,5,B00R1MMKNK,"Why has nobody reviewed this? It is heartbreaking and amazing. It hurts to see it. It is our future depicted and painful but please, for the sake of humanity, see it please.

It tells a realistic tale about technology in our future. It's completely believable and needs to be seen given today's context.

Be good to one another, be safe.",1460160000,5,337,4.6
8693694,5,B00R1MMKNK," a spoiler-free review 
You probably are already familiar with Black Mirror if you're thinking of getting this release, as it is the most recent episode to date (sometimes referred to as ""series 3"" despite being only one 70+ minute episode). Is it worth the outrageous ~$25 asking price on this website? Yes it is, if you have no other means of getting a copy. This is a top notch story with accomplished actors and seamless production. You may even want to watch the beginning of it again immediately after the first viewing since you will hear it differently once you know the outcome of the story.

American viewers will be familiar with some of the actors:
 Oona Chaplin (Talisa Maegyr, Game of Thrones)
 Natalia Tena (Osha, Game of Thrones)
 Rafe Spall (John Hancock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-of-Liberty/dp/B00SVLWWP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons of Liberty</a>)
 Janet Montgomery (Mary Sibley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salem/dp/B00NPF03IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salem</a>)
 Jon Hamm (really, if you don't know who he is: why not?)

If you happen to be new to Black Mirror then you are in for a treat, as this is one of the best episodes. Not for the first time (either in Black Mirror or in science fiction in general), we see how imagined future technologies can create all kinds of nightmare scenarios: cruel and unusual punishments, horribly wrong predatory dating, and the need to consider ""sentient rights"" for artificial intelligences (e.g., when faced with issues such as ""a fate worse than death""). Black Mirror is a [paranoid? maybe not] look at our world of vanishing privacy and what may lay in wait thanks to budding technologies like Britain's Orwellian camera ""surveillance state.""

As for Jon Hamm: he does a spectacular job, and his character is here also a player. As the last episode of Mad Men aired a few days ago, Black Mirror is the next best thing if you are going through Don Draper withdrawals.",1432166400,,2037,5.479233226837061
8693695,5,B00R1MMKNK,My favorite TV series right next to the Walking Dead. Creator Charlie Brooker is simply a genius. I just wish they would make more episodes!!!!,1427846400,3,143,4.76
