8107236,3,B000E8N9B0,"""Bill Cracks Down"" reunited two of it's stars, Grant Withers and Judith Allen, who also appeared together in ""Telephone Operator.""  Both films were released in 1937. Of the two, ""Telephone Operator"" is a much more interesting film.

The ""Bill"" who is supposed to ""crack down"" and do some real work is the playboy son of the founder of the Reardon Steel Works. Mr. Reardon has a heart problem and is worried that his son will never be able to handle the running of the steel company after he's gone. Bill has been living the high life in Paris for the last 12 years as a painter of scantily clad models.

One day Reardon shows his plant foreman Grant Withers a photo of one of Bill's paintings. Wither's breaks into a huge smile and says, ""That's the line of work I wouldn't mind getting into one day."" But Mr. Reardon has other plans for Withers.

Withers is a hard working guy who is liked by all the men in the mill. So Reardon gives him a promotion to plant manager, and tells him that when he is gone Withers is to run the mill as director. Withers had rather stay in the plant with the men, but he takes the new job out of respect of Mr. Reardon.

After Reardon's sudden death, Withers is instructed to come to the Reardon estate for the reading of the will. As it turns out, the will states that if Bill does not come home and ""get his hands dirty"" working in the steel mill for one year, the mill will become the property of Withers. Withers is shocked and embarrassed by this turn of events.

At first Bill thinks about contesting the will, but decides to obey his father's wishes and work in the mill alongside the other mill workers. To everyone's surprise, Bill develops an understanding of the hard work involved in producing steel. He gets to know the men and they warm up to him.

In the meantime, Bill and Withers' girlfriends, played by Judith Allen and Beatrice Roberts, offer a mild amount of romantic interest and conflict in what is a pretty humdrum, lightweight drama.

But there's never much real conflict between Bill and Grant Withers, as both develop early on a mutual respect for each other. But a near tragic accident in the mill comes close to spoiling everyone's plans for the future.

The picture and sound quality of this Alpha release, while not perfect, is actually pretty good. So that makes the film watchable.",1315699200,,2345,4.498823529411765
