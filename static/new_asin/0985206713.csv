7795276,5,0985206713,"I have read I'm not sick I don't need help and Im right your wrong now what, and I continue to reread and keep learning from these books. Both of these  books have helped me not only with how to communicate with my son with a severe mental illness but also in my everyday communication with everyone I talk too. I recently purchased Dr Amador DVD and it is more powerful then the books. You get to watch Dr Amador train other professionals and he does so with so much positive influence that I feel everyone looks forward to his feedback on how well they are learning his technique. If you do not purchased Dr Amadors books or DVD you are doing yourself a big injustice, so start training today.",1411603200,11,695,4.346153846153846
