8302057,4,B001FG8DC0,I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that this is not the full concert as originally aired on TV.  The performers other than the Barra MacNeils are NOT on this DVD.  The kid act and the sister act are not on this recording.  My family really enjoyed them on original VHS we had and they were disappointed at their absence.  Still a must-have in your Christmas DVD collection. The Barra MacNeils are tremendous!!,1481155200,,424,4.467532467532467
