1896939,1,B00009Y3VM,"When I first saw this title, I was quite excited to see it. Although it was pricey, I figured with three DVDs, there must be tons of content so I purchased it and was quite disappointed. The only disc with content was disc one and there was only about 40 minutes worth. The other two DVDs were Saturn launches and that's about it. The box said over six hours of content but only about 40 minutes of it was a documentary and I guess five hours of launch footage (I never watched all of the launches). I doubt very much that I will purchase other content from this series.",1081123200,6,570,4.238532110091743
1896940,5,B00009Y3VM,"When we set out to create this series of DVDs, we wanted to achieve something that all of the previous accounts of a documentary nature had not - to present this material without a filter, in a way to allow the viewer to see the maximum amount of material - both video and audio - in the best quality possible. In short, as lifelong students of the U.S. space program, we wanted to put together a collection the way we wished to see it - the way it happened.
Most importantly, we set out to present the complete television transmissions and onboard motion picture film for individual missions - material that just hasn't been available before. This material is purposely left in its original form, albiet with new digital transfers, color correction where necessary and possible, and digital noise reduction.
To do this we realized we would have to use certain unconventional methods. For example, we wished to present multiple angles of footage from rollout, suitup, etc. To do this required us to use different angles out of context, so that from time to time certain events were shown a couple of times so that the varied angles could be presented. Unless one realizes this was done to present multiple angles one might mistake it for material out of order.
Nearly all of the 16mm film from EVA training, suitup, astronauts visiting the launch pad (all of which was re-transferred from the original using modern, digital telecines) was shot silent, and since we also wished to present as much audio as possible from mission events such as countdowns, we have married this audio to that footage. The result is the maximum amount of primary source material available on the subject and results in important audio from other events used on previously silent film.
Lastly, especially for launch vehicles, we wanted to present the material we had only previously seen in short clips on documentaries, such as pad cameras, in its entirety. For those interested in the creation and flight of these vehicles, this material is fascinating, and filled with insightful information.
Much of the material on these sets is presented, purposefully, the way it was shot. Some of the Hollywood storytelling created on this subject is wonderful, we love that, too, but  as a chronicle of the greatest explorations of mankind the material deserved to be presented without such a filter. This is the way it happened, and it is amazing.
Very soon in 2004, a six-disc chronicle of Apollo 15 and a three-disc edition on the Saturn V will be released.",1076803200,29,2530,4.856481481481482
1896941,4,B00009Y3VM,"If you have a NASA addict in your family, this (and the other three titles in the series) are a ""must have"". I enjoyed the documentary (approx. 40 min.) but the other 5+ hours is just NASA footage, without narration, from various observation cameras. Boring, you say? Yes, I do, too. But I bought them for my husband, and it's probably the best gift I've given him in the past 20 years. If you put any rocket on the screen he's hooked, but with these DVDs he enjoys the multi-angle aspect, and will watch the same blast off from all possible angles. This is not everyone's cup of tea, obviously, but if you have to get a gift for someone who is fixated on the American space program, you can't get much better than this. I expect to find the Apollo sets more interesting, but he started watching the Gemini and Saturn sets first.",1061510400,23,829,4.3896103896103895
1896942,5,B00009Y3VM,"If your knowledge of the Apollo program is ""One small step for a man..."" or the Tom Hanks version of Apollo 13, then you should discover the real story of all the small steps - and some pretty big ones - that led to the historic landing on the moon. An unsung hero of the moon program were the Saturn 1 and Saturn 1B rockets. These ""little brothers"" of the mighty Saturn V were the first ""heavy lift"" launch vehicles developed during the space race, and were used for the first Apollo flight (Apollo 7) as well as the last Apollo flight (the Apollo/Soyuz Test Project) and three missions to SkyLab.
This DVD contains an approximately 45 minute production which tells the story of the Saturn 1 and 1B. The rest of the several hours of this DVD set is chocked full of isolated camera views of various launches and films made during the construction of these Saturn vehicles (including my favorite sequence, from inside the fuel tank of a Saturn 1 during launch - a unique perspective...that fuel gets out of there in a HURRY!)
This Spacecraft Films documentary does a terrific service of preserving this important part in our spaceflight history. They maintain a completely digital trail starting with the original material at the National Archives and Marshall Spaceflight Center to your home DVD player. There are no Hollywood stars or hokey special effects. This is the real deal.
Other disk sets in the series include Apollo moonwalks, shuttle flights and the Saturn V. All direct-to-digital and a must have for any space junkie.",1047081600,8,1531,4.7593984962406015

7994291,5,B00009Y3VM,Bought this hard-to-find DVD set as a present for my brother-- excellent material for folks who are in to this sort of detailed information!,1418428800,,140,4.875
7994292,4,B00009Y3VM,"Spacecraft films do an excellent series of videos although they are aimed really at the hardcore NASA or space fan and are not really for the casual person.
A lot of the film clips in this video are without sound. After a short introductory video lasting about 45 minutes, you get various video clips regarding the Saturn 1 and 1B vehicles ranging from engine tests to various angles of every launch of the Saturn 1 and 1B.
Before watching this I watched the Spacecraft films collection on the Mighty Saturns (Saturn V) and found that collection more entertaining and enjoyable than this one. The lack of sound on some of the movie clips may put people off but they are still very interesting.
There is a lot of footage in here that I have never seen before (I have watched virtually every video available on the Apollo era) and if you are a NASA or space buff then it's hard to fault these movies.
If this is the first Spacecraft films collection that you are buying I would recommend the Mighty Saturns over this one however.",1316649600,,1027,4.526881720430108
7994293,5,B00009Y3VM,"The Mighty Saturns: Saturn I and IB (2002) gets a full five stars from this space fan.  I agree with everything good which has been written by my fellow fans of the space program.  These enhanced films of the Saturn I series are the clearest and most comprehensive coverage you will find on DVD anywhere. Caution non-space fans, most of ths footage is recorded by engineering cameras filming every moment of flight from various vantage points (including within the fuel tanks of sloshing propellant, from various stages of the launch vehicle peering up at the next stage or aft at the prior stage, stage retro rockets and upper stage ullage rockets firing, etc.), so this product is not for everyone.  However, feel free to buy it for any real space cadets you know.",1239926400,,766,4.7443609022556394
7994294,4,B00009Y3VM,"Many people are likely to be underwhelmed by this DVD set but it does have its place. It consists of 3 separate DVDs. Only the first one can be said to have a real program on it. That program is a good, but short, documentary of the Saturn I and Saturn IB project. It deals with the rationale and development and does a good job in a little time.
The rest though, might disappoint, depending upon the desires of the viewers. It is mostly raw footage. There is coverage of each of the Saturn I and IB flights and the footage comes from many angles and perspectives but it is just that: raw footage with no commentary. This is a real bonanza for rocket buffs but is likely to disappoint people who want more information.
Disk synopses appear below:

DISK ONE
I and IB Programs - a nice little 40 minute documentary outlining the development of the Saturn I and Saturn IB programs. Included are interviews with many who took part in the program. Footage is present from each of the Saturn I and IB launches.

Extras include silent footage of the construction of the first stage fuel tanks, test firing of the S-I stage, S-IV stage Insulation and Handling, S-IV Stage Test Firing, Several on-board camera feeds, and lots of pad operations footage.

DISK TWO
Disk 2 is little more than raw footage. The two ""features"" consist of footage of all the Saturn I launches and all the Saturn IB launches respectively. There is no commentary, just the footage. The extras are just as mundane and consist of footage from a LM checkout, Skylab and the installation of an H-1 engine.

DISK THREE
Disk 3 is just more raw footage from different angles. These are taken from the Apollo 7 flight and include footage from the perimeter, Tracking views, swing arm and tower views and pedestal views.",1183852800,,1777,4.578616352201258

7994297,5,B00009Y3VM,"I've just went through my last addition to my Spacecraftfilms collection - the Saturn 1&1B DVD. I can say I am excited - here is simply everything you want to know on Saturns development. Opening documentary is making you ready to absorb the rest and nothing is omited - assembly, test firings, pad operations and launches. Selection is made very carefully trying to avoid repeating even if it is simply not completely possible. You can see very nicely how the Pad 34 construction developed and how the Saturns themselves changed from launch to launch - e.g.just focus on first stage tail stabilisators. Apollo 7 launch is covered in full, I do not think there was a camera which is not on the DVD. If you look for the most complete Saturn 1 &1B footage so you have it here. I would always encourage the Spacecraftfilms to put maximum available material, if somebody thinks it's too detailed there's always the option to skip some part. But for the space enthusiasts this is fantastic - I always dreamt of the material like this being put together.",1109116800,6,1048,4.701086956521739
7994298,5,B00009Y3VM,"Like the other DVD sets in the Spacecraft Films series, this is a gem, detailing the development of the oft-forgotten early model Saturns. The three DVDs run at over six hours and include an enormous amount of archival footage of all Saturn I and IB launches. Most people will find the 43 minute documentary on disc one the most interesting part of the set. In that section the producers interview many Saturn program veterans, many of whom discuss Wernher von Braun.

I am very interested in the Apollo program, so this was an ideal set for me. Having said that, this set is not for casual space enthusiasts inasmuch as much of the footage of the various launches looks very similar (and some of the footage does not have audio.) One interesting thing to watch for is the changes that took place in the pad and gantry area between the early launches and the last Saturn launches to Skylab (and Apollo/Soyuz) when the Apollo/Saturn stack is elevated on a stand to be able to use the Saturn V fixtures.

This DVD set is intended for people with more than a passing interest in the Apollo program: if you are in that group you will love this set.",1104019200,6,1144,4.521739130434782
7994299,5,B00009Y3VM,"This set is quite good.  Very good transfers of original NASA films of Launches from the earliest Saturn Rocket to the 1B.  Note this set does not include the Saturn V launches and is contained on a different DVD Set.
The Series starts off with an excellent documentary on the Saturn Rockets.  NASA hoped to use existing rockets as clusters to create the 1B rocket.  It was hugely successful and was later re-used for later Soyuz docking flight.
The archival launch films highlight just about every angle, from the lauch pad, from below the rocket, above the rocket, etc and it was great to see this.  It is nice to see that the film transfers look as well as they do.  I've seen older NASA film transfers that basically look like they were filmed off a projection screen.  These appear to be digitally scanned per frame.  I recommend this highly.",1087948800,15,847,4.6
