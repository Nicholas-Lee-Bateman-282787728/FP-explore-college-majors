After some of the missteps of the last couple of season of Supernatural, I had my worries about what a new season would bring, but if the rest of Season 8 lives up to the premier, my worries will have been in vain. I loved the opening and the set-up of the season long arcs and the introduction of new characters.

When we left Sam and Dean at the end of Season 7, Dean was in Purgatory and Cas had just disappeared, Kevin, the new prophet had been kidnapped by the always delightful Crowley, Bobby's soul had been set free in death and Sam was left all alone to find Dean, save Kevin and fight the Leviathons. It turns out that Sam did none of those things, a character choice that is sure to be controversial but that has some roots in past behavior and plots. Dean it seems may have been a very bad boy in Purgatory, a place he nicknamed Pure, no doubt because of the purity of the intent to survive that is necessary. It seems that in Purgatory, upon the disappearance of Cas, Dean teamed with a sexy, Southern vampire named Benny. Cas is dead or close enough to it to make no difference according to Dean and this forms the first mystery. Just what did happen to Cas and how did Dean get out of Pure? The viewer gets tantalizing glimpses of Dean and Benny's time in Purgatory via flashback.

Kevin has grown a lot in the last year mostly because necessity is the mother of invention and desperation is the father of survival. Kevin was kidnapped by Crowley and shown another tablet to translate. How he escaped Crowley and begged Sam for help is also shown in flashback.

Women, as always fare badly in the Supernatural universe with one death and one desertion in the first episode alone, but this seems to be the norm for Supernatural. Geekboys have no idea how to write realistic women or realistic relationships with women whether romantic or platonic, they can only do fantasy wish fulfillment (Dean's overwhemlming number of notches on his belt) or idealization of dead women (mom, Jessica, Meg, Jo, etc. etc. etc, the list is far too long) but idealization of dead women was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, arguably one of the first nerd writers of the supernatural and fantastic so I suppose the writers are in good company here.

All in all a great set-up to the season, including the character controversy and I look forward to see where the writers are going to take it.

One last footnote, the Leviathan, those monsters whose weakness is a Victorian bug killer, are around but don't seem like they will be a focus for the season. Supernatural fans should check this out with no worries and newbies should start with the first season and catch-up. Recommended to fans of sci-fi and urban fantasy.",1350086400,,2746,4.548582995951417
5347073,5,B009LDCXNY,"If the series and the season of Supernatural stays as strong as the first two episodes than viewers are in for a treat. Last week Supernatural put its pieces on the board with Dean returning from Purgatory, Cas missing and unaccounted for, Sam deserting a relationship in much the same way he deserted his responsibilities and Kevin, much stronger and more competent but angered and grieved at the murder of his girlfriend at the hands of Crowley, who is seeking to regain the new prophecy tablet that details how to close the gates of hell forever.

Sam, Dean and Keving need to recover the tablet too and set off to do so after a brief detour to find Kevin's mother and put her someplace safe. But both Keven and Kevin's mother have other ideas and this leads the entire group to a very strange auction of magical artifacts. This auction is a great set-piece and has some Easter eggs in it from other favorites of the fantastic including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

I won't give any more details of a wonderful episode except to say that we end with more complications than we started with but in a believeable and organic way. The viewer is also treated to more flashbacks of Dean's time in Purgatory, a storyline that is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ever, especially in light of the fact that we saw only the results of Dean's trip to hell. Highly recommended and I am more excited for a season of SPN than I have been since the apocalypse was coming. Highly recommended.

A final aside - Pluto, the God of Greed has a cameo in the episode and it is a pretty good joke on the way the word plutocrat has been so common in political commentary lately.",1350000000,3,1696,4.446945337620579
5347074,5,B009LDCXNY,"This episode serves as an excellent set-up for season 8;  many of the old favorites are back and not don't the king of vampires is hiding out somewhere waiting to make another appearance.  Season seven seemed a bit over-campy in spots, but this episode raises hopes that season eight will be equal to the best of the seasons.",1349913600,9,325,4.586206896551724

5347203,5,B009LDCXNY,"Political correctness can take some down time. Supernatural is back to celebrate all things dis-functional and dark, including humor.l. Dean is back from his travel to exotic places and has serious anger management issues. A year in purgatory can do that to you. Dean's relationship with Sam becomes even more toxic as Dean tries a little too hard to be the big brother by bossing Sam around. Sam pushes back and Dean promises show more respect to Sam. Dean does show more respect to Sam - for a short time and is then back at it again. Crowley, best devil ever, is having fun getting into people's heads and messing with them by working their insecurities, doubts, guilt, low self esteem, self pity and self loathing. Cass, the little angel that could, is even more sincere in trying to help when he is not atoning for his sins and leaving epic disasters in his wake. Kevin the prophet starts to come into his own this season. Into this mix new characters are added such as Benny the vampire and Charley the hacker.",1474848000,,1016,4.587912087912088
5347204,5,B009LDCXNY,"Lovely season to watch again and now forever on bluray or digital.  Sam and Dean On the road again.  WIsh they made more shows like supernatural. A twist of all the myths and legends we all know about monsters, ufos, god, etc.  Cant wait to watch.

My only downside is I been getting some bad copies of supernatural sets from amazon.  Just recently I got 3 damage cases from amazon directly.  My other supernatural  season sets and bluray movies that shipped in the same delivery box with the damage supernatural cases were okay.  The 3rd party  sellers or sets i bought NOT from amazon didn't have broken pieces scattered, rips or tears.  Luckily i was able to replace 2 out of the 3 busted cases with backup cases of my own, but still I don't like seeing damage goods every single order.  Thankfully the return policy is great for amazon and I can get a new one, but am really having trust issues now with amazon on their care of products or bluray movies.

Other than the broken supernatural cases from Amazon Supernatural is a great show and everyone should be really happy Season 12 is happening!!!  Cant wait to See Dean's mom embarrass the hell out of her boz with mommies fairy tales of baby dean or baby sam.

-Update- Sep 30
Replacement came no damage or missing parts to case for this one but I would still watch out.  Glad the return service of amazon is great and fast to respond.",1474761600,2,1393,4.450592885375494

However, I noticed as the episodes advance, there are more of / and a higher percentage of - ""tough guy"" unrealistic female characters (not of the demon sort).  The more they follow this current Hollywood formula (""tough chicks""), the more the show will become just like any other and its uniqueness and genuine touch will fade.  Season 8 it showing more signs of this, as is season 9.  When characters are as unrealistic as the plot (even as the plot is intentionally so) then you've fallen into (as Stiller's character did in Tropic Thunder) ""full retard"".  Sam and Dean?  I've met characters like those all my life.",1461024000,,754,4.674242424242424

5347308,5,B009LDCXNY,"Absolutely great series!!!  Great buy!!! Love this series!  Although definitely not kid friendly it is a great adult treat. The main characters are super engaging and you find you can get really emotionally invested. The writers and producers are genius and make each episode its own story. You can easily walk into the series at any point and get enough content information to know what is going on and not feel completely lost. Sam and Dean are thoroughly entertaining and their character plots are quite thought provoking. The content can be graphic at times but not over the top. There are multiple story lines going simultaneously but it's done eloquently so you get just enough critical detail to remember from episode to episode. They offer great previous episode reviews before each new one. The ""the road so far"" segments viewers can get caught up on crucial details from previous episodes that are relevant to what you are about to watch further deepening your understanding of the narrative. You leave each episode emotional and excited about what is going to happen next. It's easy to get wrapped up in the Supernatural world. I love that the focus isn't targeted exclusively at the monsters but rather the relationship between main characters. It's engaging and thought provoking.

5347505,5,B009LDCXNY,"Supernatural's Season 8 had some really good spots.  Dean's journey in Purgatory and friendship with Benny is one such point.  Sam's ""normal life"" with the 'white picket fence' life, while great for him, didn't improve the story much other than to let the viewers know what was happening with him.

Naomi, the newest 'person we love to hate' had an interesting position.  As a monitor of heaven she seemed to have ulterior motives.  Her relationship with Castiel was always in question.  The main person we love to hate, Crowley... Well, Crowley is Crowley.  When the writers have him in mind, you know there's going to be some fun.  Personally, I really like Mark A. Shepherd's portrayal of The King of Hell.  He seems like he's having a blast with the character.  (And, as a sidebar, I see Crowley as an extension to his portrayal of Badger in Firefly.)

The introduction to the Men of Letters and their new ""Batcave"" was a cool twist.  Take Bobby's house and multiply it by 1000 and you've the Men of Letters' HQ.  The guys have seemed to settled into their lair nicely.  Kevin the Prophet was busy translating/decoding the various tablet ""Word of God"" written by Metatron while dodging demons and Crowley.  Metatron, (Curtis Armstrong aka Booger from Revenge of the Nerds) had been ""plucked from obscurity"", his words, to be the scribe of God.  We find out later that Metatron, like most of the other angels we've been introduced to, has an ulterior motive.  That leaves Cass.  Poor Cass.  As hard as he tries to be a good guy, he just doesn't seem to get there.  Much like his inability to understand humans, Cass cannot grasp judgment of character.

Season 8 does not leave the viewer wanting for anything except perhaps the ""ganking of monsters"".  Yes, there's monsters, occasionally.  But most of the season has been dedicated to the above.",1434585600,,1848,4.760252365930599

5347633,1,B009LDCXNY,"I thought Sara Gamble sucked with seasons 6 and 7, but those are great compared to this.

I had to stop after 3 episodes and I am done with the show. I thought it was bad that Dean got all whiny in season 6 over Castiel working with Crowley to stop Armageddon from getting started up when Dean worked with Crowley to stop it the first time. This season is worse than that.

Dean gets whiny about Sam taking a year off when Dean did the exact same thing when Sam was vacationing with Lucifer and Michael.

Sam whines ""I want a normal life, I never had that before"" and ""I want to go to college"". I think going to Stanford for 4 years and having friends and a girlfriend qualifies as both a normal life and going to college.

That was enough for me. If the actors don't care enough to remember their characters back-history, much less the incompetent producer CW foolishly hired, why should I care about the show?

It's too bad, for all its flaws and ripping off X-files episodes, the first 5 seasons was decent to very good. For all the X-Files comparisons, I think that another Chris Carter show is really at the heart of Supernatural: Millennium. That show asked what is good and evil and how does people's decisions fall within those two extremes.

Too bad they didn't cancel this series after 5 seasons, with the last 30 seconds of the last episode removed. Both Millennium and X-Files ran too long. The last season of Millennium and the last two of the X-Files never should have happened.

I can't believe this train-wreck is still on-going.",1426204800,2,1545,4.476868327402135

5347824,4,B009LDCXNY,"I love the series, particularly Jenson Ackles/Dean Winchester's character and performance.

Highlights include the progression of Kevin, who became savvy and brave.

Love Abaddon, played by Alaina Huffman, who just relished the role.  Such a great actress.  Just the little nuances - surprise at Crowley's rise, her malicious smiles.  She was a worthy villain and a welcome addition to the franchise.  I wish there was more of her.  She became a quick favorite.  I especially enjoyed her performance in Clip Show and Sacrifice.

The bad was Naomi/Naomi Tapping, who was an unnecessary functional bureaucrat.  I really didn't care for her, and her chemistry with Sam, Dean and even Crowley just wasn't there.  She just didn't fit.  The series really didn't need her.

But worse than Naomi was the character of Liane Balaban/Amelia Richardson.  Is there a more worthless character in the Supernatural franchise?  I loathed every scene with her, so much that I had to turn the channel.  The show came to an abrupt screech every time she was on screen.  Her placidity wore on my nerves, and I detested her more than any other character.  She was added for the sake of having more female characters, and it showed.  She was superfluous and extraneous, and I couldn't understand what Sam saw in her.  No offense to the actress; I just hated the whole storyline.

I liked Lauren Tom/Linda Tran and I especially enjoyed Ty Olsson/Benny Lafitte's dilemma.

I know Charlie Bradbury/Felicia Day is a fan favorite, but I really don't care for her.  She is weak and awkward, and I just cringe every time she appears.

As the series progressed, the show got better with the introduction of Abaddon and Metatron.  (Really hated Curtis Armstrong in the role, and I really didn't like that a writer was a villain.)  But the highlights sang more than the bad episodes.

The season finale was my favorite.",1416700800,,1886,4.904761904761905

5347920,5,B009LDCXNY,"This is a great season. It starts off with some tension between the brothers--Dean had no help from Sam returning from Purgatory, and he's clearly upset about it (as was I. Come on, Sam!). The tension is used to good effect, though, as they work their way back to where they were,both in the present and through a series of flashbacks. (Flashbacks to Purgatory looks pretty cool, by the way.)
The main storyline this season is driven by the tablets and the Trials to close the gates of Hell. It's a good, solid storyline, sending the brothers to all sorts of places on their quest. The Men of Letters are introduced, which turns out of be pretty important--and they have an awesome underground bunker. My favourite part is the story arc brought together in the last six or so episodes. These are the Winchester boys we know and love, and the finale is just phenomenal.
We see a lot more of the prophet Kevin, wonderfully brought to life by Osric Chau. Garth returns, attempting to fill in for Bobby, and there's more of Charlie Bradbury, queen of the nerds. Also, Amanda Tapping. It's disconcerting to see her playing the bad guy, but she does it well. A lot is explained about the angels within her story arc, and things in past seasons begin to make a little more sense.
This season balances the light and serious episodes pretty well. We've got Nazi Necromancers, medieval LARPing, time travel through a closet, and an entire episode where the physics come straight out of a Looney Tunes cartoon, but it never gets too silly. It all works, and it's fun. And then the end. Oh, the end is so good!",1413158400,,1598,4.571428571428571
5347921,5,B009LDCXNY,Perfect! Great birthday gift for my mother. She loves this so much!,1413072000,,67,4.666666666666667
5347922,5,B009LDCXNY,What can say! Season 8 really brought the supernatural series back to its original arc of winchester sacrifice. Which i might add every supernatural fan enjoys.,1413072000,,160,5.1923076923076925
5347923,5,B009LDCXNY,"With Dean in Purgatory and Sam left all alone without Castiel or Bobby, Sam does what he has always wanted to do. He settled down with a woman he fell in love with and lived a normal, demon and monster free, life. Dean, on the other hand, has been in Purgatory for a year, chasing and being chased by demons, monsters, vampires and leviathans. Then, of all places, he finds a contrite Castiel there, doing penance for all the damage that he's done or inadvertently, allowed. And while the two of them search for a way out, Dean runs across a most unusual and unlikely, friend. A vampire named, Benny. But, in order to know the where abouts of the portal, Benny wants to go topside and because space through the portal is limited, he has to go through Dean, literally. Whereas Castiel, doesn't feel that he deserves freedom, so although he goes to the portal with Dean, he does the unexpected. He does not go through the portal but allows Dean and the vampire within him - Benny, to go through it. Having made it to the other side, Dean loosens the vampire from within himself and gains a valuable ally and a new 'brother'. Then comes the awkward reunion between Sam and Dean, and Sam's disclosure that during the year that Dean was gone, Sam did not look for him. Preferring to finally nest, with a woman he loves and their dog. Then suddenly, Castiel is out of Purgatory as well, but doesn't know how he got out. All this and so much more on 6 disc's as depicted on 23 episodes. This series is superb and every program with the exception of the season cliff hanger, is conclusive within itself. No boring shows here, eh?! :) Nina Kish",1412985600,,1635,4.4352159468438535

5348086,3,B009LDCXNY,"As season 8 begins we meet the impossibly cute Kevin who showed up near the end of Season 7, a lad with dimples so adorable it is felt necessary to have him declare, Im not gay. As the story progresses the brothers are aging in real life and on screen. Flashbacks of the past year Sam spent with a young lady during Deans year in purgatory show Sam appearing a giant beside the diminutive lass and her father. Care is no longer being taken to disguise the fact that he towers over his supposed older brother Dean. Calling him little Sammy is almost laughable. The plot lines, if it be possible, seem even darker than before. Sam goes to Hell and back. We see flashbacks of Deans year in purgatory.

With the angels in heaven at war with one another the lines between the good guys and the bad guys are definitely blurred. The brothers are good ole boys who continue to roar around the countryside in that Chevy Impala listening to Rock. How they maintain their sleek physiques on their diet of beer, liquor, and junk food remains a mystery. The arsenal they carry in the compartment under their trunk? The show continues to be ultra-violent but save for a sequence at the beginning of an episode in Season 7 showing off Jared Padaleckis impressive upper body these hunks keep their clothes on.

As we wait for the release of Season 9 on DVD Season 10 is ongoing on broadcast TV. How much longer can the writers and producers drag out this scenario and keep it interesting?",1407456000,,1472,4.4888059701492535

5348091,4,B009LDCXNY,"While ""Supernatural"" is still making great stories and this season is good, the box set for this release isn't. I'm guessing whoever makes these box sets are making them with cheaper materials the further we get into the series. Seasons 1-6 have a clear box and different artwork inside. Season 7 did away with the clear box and different artwork to replace it with a black box and the same writing inside and out. Now with season 8, it is the same, but there isn't a cover to the episode guide. It just has ""Supernatural season 8"" written at the top. I know that I shouldn't complain about a box set when it's the episodes to talk about, but if they are making it the same for season 9, I wouldn't want to pay $40 for a cheaply made item. That is why I took off one star.",1406937600,,772,4.222972972972973

5348442,5,B009LDCXNY,"How many shows are still maintaining a high standard of storytelling and acting after 8 seasons? Almost none. In fact Supernatural is pretty much in a league of its own in terms of its well deserved ongoing popularity and the huge and passionate following it has.

Regarding this season in particular - I'd describe it as a season of 2 halves. Without spoiling the plot, suffice to say that unfortunately the heart of the show - which is the incredibly close relationship between the brothers Dean and Sam - is somewhat missing in the first few eps. This is a mistake that was spotted (when the episodes aired and the message that fans were unhappy reached the ears of the writers loud and clear) and rectified. The second half (from episode 10 onwards) was amazing - culminating in a season finale that was the best acted, and written and most moving episode of the show for a long time.

I'd highly recommend this show but don't start at season 8. Start at the beginning. You'll soon be hooked and you'll find yourself buying season after season and devouring them. Once you start you won't want to stop but you'll never regret it.",1389830400,,1133,4.603960396039604

5348505,5,B009LDCXNY,"The great advantage of having one season in DVD format is that we can in two or three days have a complete vision of the whole season. Then we can look at the architecture of the twenty-three episodes as a whole and not a brochette of tit bits.

But at the same time the unity of the season is not always really complete. The producers keep some episodes that have nothing to do with the main central theme and are nothing but entertainment, some kind of recreational play time, probably to just satisfy the part of the audience who want isolated episodes and some esoteric monsters that are existing just by themselves. Djinns for example. These episodes for me are disturbing because they do not follow the main line and they scatter our attention, even if the producers are going to tell me that it corresponds to the way the very much younger generation navigates on modern tablets, 3G or even 4G cell phones, not to speak of the Internet by itself.

The second remark Ill make concerns the sexual level of the series. They must be bothered somewhere with the great success of wincest among the fans. In this series there is a short lesbian kissing scene and there is an ambiguous relation between a male witch and his male cat familiar that could be gay,  but the witch in the end kills his familiar and his problem was the fact that another male witch was chosen by a female dog familiar. The first witch wanted that familiar. So he created havoc for the other happy witch. Not very gay indeed. Apart from that the series was very careful to avoid any ambiguous or simply slightly undressed scene and Sam at the beginning has been living with a woman for several months and that woman will come back a couple of times in the series.

So I guess the rivalry between the two brothers and their constant falling back into their mutual arms for a hug is nothing but good old manly love, generally called brotherly love. That must disappoint the wincest-uous fans. Too bad, though this sudden rather prude approach is for me something treacherous about the two characters. The love of these two brothers is becoming more and more hostile. That common idea that I hate you because I love you too much, and wincest come back: they become hostile out of the frustration in which the producers keep them by preventing them from satisfying their gay desires. In other words they suffer from forced closet-reclusion. I guess the Winchester brothers should go to court for their liberation.

The main line revolves around two divine tablets, a demon tablet that we had already heard about and an angel tablet that is new. We come back to the prophet who is able to read and translate these tablets because he has direct knowledge of the language of God. Castiel is definitely maimed and he is wavering between one clan or the other in heaven, not to speak of his allegiance or loyalty to the Winchester brothers. These tablets are of course the objects of fights between the demons headed by the King of Hell, Crowley, the angels, or the various factions of angels, the main one being led by a woman Naomi who is a real monster in her own understanding of pure evil in the name of eternal angelic good. She is typical of these people who are eternal. They do not consider the life of mortal people is in any way respectable. Killing for them is the same thing, even many less painful than for us, as urinating against a church or a school.

The stake is that these tablets enable a chosen one to close all gates to Hell for the demon tablet, and all gates to Heaven for the angel tablet. But a marginal character is introduced, the scribe of God, the one who took all the thinking and decisions of God in writ on all those tablets I guess, or on celestial books probably made of cloud mist, and he probably wrote with a mini-flash of lightning. In that line the producers even bring on the side an episode with Zeus and I don't know what other Olympian beings and quarrels. That scribe Metatron is disturbed in his Indian reservation of the Two Rivers Tribe by Sam and Dean and he decides to get out of his reclusion and to seize power in Heaven in order to get rid of all angels and make them come down, or simply cast them down, to earth. He is the most vicious person you can imagine and he manages to succeed, and he does not forget to deprive Castiel of his angelic soul or essence before sending him back to earth.

On the other hand the brothers have tried to close the gates to Hell and they have three tasks to perform in order to do it. Kill a hound a hell. Easy. Save an innocent man from Hell and let him go to Heaven. Slightly more difficult but they get Bobby out and up. In fact Sam fulfills the two tasks. The third one is to cure a demon. They decide to capture Crowley and to clean him up into salvation or repentance or liberation. Sam is on the point of fulfilling the last task, when Dean arrives and prevents the very last gesture because he was told by some authority, the disrespectable Naomi who held it from the torturing debriefing she submitted the scribe to, that it would mean the death of the one who would succeed, in the tradition of the good old Christian sacrifice.

And at this moment the angels start falling from Heaven, i.e. the sky. And that is the end of the season. Frustrating, a lot, much, galore. Thats what I call a douche bag of an ending. In another direction it is a very suspenseful ending.

The last element to tell about this season is the introduction of an older generation on the Winchester side: the great grandfather of the boys. He was not a hunter. He was a Man of Letters, meaning a member of a secret society that fought against evil forces by first collecting information and then getting rid of those they encountered. Anne Rice had used that kind of device in her vampire novels and her secret society went back to very old historical times and the Celts are part of these historical times because they knew how to write, just like all Germanic tribes. Sam and Dean thus manage to meet their great grandfather who gets entangled in the 1950s in some time travelling and erupts in their motel room. But this encounter is essential because they can recuperate the key to the secret haven or coven of the Men of Letters in the USA and it becomes their new back base. It is entirely demon protected and they even have an inner demon-proof panic room. But the season is now finished and we regret the episodes that brought nothing on the main story line because the season could have progressed faster. Well wait anyway, knowing that the ninth season must be greatly deadly and supernatural because 9 is the hour of the death of Jesus and it is also the number of many devilish forces, if not 999 or 666 (an upside down 999, and vice versa) and then it is the Beast in the Apocalypse, at least the Christian one.

But it is fun in many ways, even if the speculation on these tablets is presented as if it were archaeology in the bonuses. But well, why not, since the Book of Mormon is based on such discs in some divine language that the prophet Smith was able to read and translate though he did not have any kind of high school level in education. Thats what is good about prophets. They know without learning. I guess many people would like to be prophets in their most horrible subjects, be they math, physics, chemistry, foreign languages, history or even farniente.

5348550,3,B009LDCXNY,"The problem with Supernatural is that it is a show which has set the bar very high for itself, but can't always meet those standards. Ackles and Padalecki do a great job as Dean and Sam, but you can only do so much with average material and disappointing story-lines. There were some excellent ideas: Purgatory, The Men of Letters, Benny but none of them was ever allowed to fully develop because of the insistence on what is for me a now overworked angel theme.
Likewise there were too many inconsistencies with previous seasons, not to mention Sam being a podperson for the first half of the season.
I was never not going to buy this season, as I have the previous seven, but I didn't rush to buy it and was agreeably surprised to find it on sale for Cyber Monday.
If this had been my first season of seeing Supernatural, I'm not sure I would have returned for Season 9, but when you've seen the quality the show can produce, hope springs eternal.",1388448000,,949,4.459770114942529

5348562,5,B009LDCXNY,Huge fan of the show. I have nothing bad to say about the 8th season.  Just wish the DVD had more outtakes and bloopers.  They are holding back!,1388275200,,144,4.107142857142857
5348563,5,B009LDCXNY,"Fast and bad ass muscle cars, classic rock, family loyalty, love, self sacrifice to save others, magic used for the good side of things, hunting down and stopping the monsters of this world, looked upon as a bad guy when you're really truly THE good guy, demons, angles, guns, the best story ever told....... what is not to love? I was worried about season 8....but it was great. Love Benny...the loyal good guy to the end that just never fit in and wasn't ever allowed to belong anywhere. I hope Benny comes back. I actually cried during the episodes involving him...and still do every single time I watch those certain scenes. Little embarrassing to admit that...but....",1388188800,,672,4.801724137931035

5348576,5,B009LDCXNY,"The bluray has all the episodes from season gr8t (as the fandom has dubbed it). with the classsic SPN gag reel. I like the extra stuff, like the interveiws, and the episodes with commentary. The quality looks great, and the writing itself was the the most consistently quality since season 5. Ben Edlund was a great choice for show runner, and I wish he stayed on for this season. The Purgatory storyline was interesting  and fresh. I wasn't into Sam's storyline with Amelia as much, but it was executed well. Also, I love the addiition of Benny, I think he provided a new dynamic to the show, as well as a new insight into Dean, and Dean & Sam's relationship. I would have wished for more Castiel because his dynamic with the brothers is always interesting & stretches the show from good to great. But the angel storyline in this one was really strange & wonderful! It showed heaven as this beurocratic government in shambles. The finale was visually and textually breathtaking, setting up the next season with promise of so much potential for greatness.",1388102400,,1055,4.702702702702703

5348589,5,B009LDCXNY,"To all the fans of the boys, this is a great purchase.  It seems we owe the boys, (Dean and Sam) for saving the world again.  Dean as you may remember is trapped in Purgatory, and makes some very strange friendships.  I have all the seasons of Supernatural, and some how they can still keep me interested.  So if you like vampires, werewolves, or just the run of the mill demon, this season on DVD is for you.  It is by far (somehow) as good or better than their first season.  So grab the remote, a bag of popcorn, and settle in for a wild ride through the SUPERNATURAL.  No doubt you will still be amazed at how the unseen creatures keep coming around and the boys keep on keepin on.",1387238400,,685,4.183206106870229

5348634,4,B009LDCXNY,"It would be a sad day should discs become no more. The thought of being totally web dependent is sad beyond words. As things evolve we come to enjoy series such as Supernatural. Series are going to have formulas and after a season or two you have the one for the series you are watching. The question of when are they going to Jump the Shark comes to play like with Smallville. Supernatural isn't quite there but close enough that one really doesn't need to wait a week or even hope to find it On Demand. Wait for those times when homebound like when illness strikes or snowbound. Have a Supernatural Party and go through the season. Works well also for most HBO shows like True Blood. With in ten minutes, if a fan you will remember, where you left off come up to speed and be well into the season. At the end of the last disc you won't feel rushed to see the sequel as you can smile confident that next year there will be another snow storm or some other house binding event and you will all have something to look forward to. True all have to live tell then, but should this not be you may find that Supernatural isn't Science Fiction.",1385769600,,1138,4.273148148148148

It took a second look to breather easier and to appreciate the fine writing and acting in this formidable series, I buy each one and will continue to do so. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, one of the finest actor I know, played the dad in this show...he also played Deni in Grey's Anatomy, Izzy's very sick love of her life...Why of Why must he always die. Come on creators, create a show with him as a star and don't kill him off...I hated that part.",1385683200,,555,4.398058252427185

5348652,3,B009LDCXNY,"My wife loves this show. I think that it is very interesting that the two leads at some point in their lives expressed belief in God and Christ. Now that they have been doing this show, neither of them express that view anymore. Even Mark Shepard (Satan on this show and Jacob on LOST) believed in Christ. As a believer myself, I find the shows view that God, Satan, Angels and Demons are all the same. All are manipulative and have a jealousy/hatred of humans.

5348692,4,B009LDCXNY,"I love this show, so of course I am satisfied.  I don't know if it is just my DVD player or the DVD itself, but I am not able to pause the DVD.  It's not a big deal, because I can stop the DVD on my DVD player and hit play to start right where I left off.",1383264000,,255,3.3793103448275863
5348693,5,B009LDCXNY,"I have a deep love for Supernatural. After the atrocity that was Season Seven I didn't have much hope for the series. Boy, was I wrong. Season Eight surpassed many of it's previous seasons. The acting gets better, the writing sure as Hell gets better, and, the VFX team really goes all out a few times this season. Definitely worth the price tag if you're a Supernatural fan.",1383264000,,375,4.529411764705882

5348716,5,B009LDCXNY,Always a great show to watch.  I don't think I will ever stop watching this show because it is one of the best on tv.,1383091200,,117,3.68
5348717,5,B009LDCXNY,"yup I love Supernatural, obviously I don't want to give this season away for those of you who haven't seen it yet, but it's definitely worth purchasing.",1383091200,,152,4.666666666666667
5348718,3,B009LDCXNY,"Season 8 was a pretty weak season for Supernatural. The thing that keeps this show going are the main actors, and not because they are great actors but because they are good looking guys. I'm not sure which guy is which, but the actor who plays Sam is the better looking of the two guys. The actor who is Dean is just an average looking guy. I think at the end of the day though it is the coolness of these guys on camera and of course the dark story lines. That said the writing was pretty bad this season. I don't even follow this ""Men of Letters"" subplot. It does nothing for me. And the Sam character just won't stop talking about wanting to split up with his brother to live a simple conservative life, and one without hunting things. The Dean character believes he can have no real life, and he doesn't feel he can go on without his brother. For more seasons than I can remember now it has been Dean pulling Sam along, keeping him from quitting the life of hunting demons, monsters, vampires, ghouls, etc. There is supposed this rich story line of the struggle of Sam and Dean to stay together, to love each other as brothers, to keep the family together. The problem is that that story line has been so overused to where it is nauseating. I mentally zone out when Dean has one of his heart to heart talks with Sam. It's just more of the same.  And as for writing, the writers are jumping to the chase. In the first episode of 8 Dean was abruptly out of purgatory. The other story of the Dick character and the ""big mouths"" from last season was over so quick to where I kept wondering why it wasn't continuing. The thing is Sam and Dean offed Dick so fast in the last episode of season 7 to where I barely realized that whole story line had concluded.

This season we saw Dean rescue a ghostly version of Bobby Springer from Hell. Yes, Dean came through a back door in Hell and found Bobby in like five minutes, and then they were out of Hell and Bobby made it back to heaven. Stuff happens so fast because so much is glossed over. I realize it would cost a lot of money and it would be complicated to have an extended stay in Hell but the pop in to Hell was a bit of a joke. The pop out of purgatory was also a bit of a joke. And of course a whole year had passed and the viewer doesn't feel a bit of that time. That time passage wasn't believable at all. When Dean went to hell the first time it was fairly believable, but the writers just didn't do anything with their story this time.

I watch Supernatural because the characters are cool and handsome. Part of me wants to be one of these guys. Part of me wants to live vicariously through these characters. And who doesn't love the gothic stuff that makes Supernatural what it is? The writers and actors go through the motions almost predicting in many stories that they will suddenly not be on the air anymore. The viewers are loyal to the show. The network is behind the show because the fans love it. Too bad the writers can't develop better stories now.

I'll tune in and I'll continue to buy the show as long as it is on the air though. Killing off the Bobby character was also a big mistake.",1383091200,,3158,4.223509933774834
5348719,5,B009LDCXNY,"Not the best season, ever made, but it's Supernatural.  This leads into season 9, which i gotta say has found it's second wind.  Great clif hanger into the next season!  This show may not be as well known as other network offerings, but i've been watching since season 5, and this has to be one of my favorite shows on TV.",1383091200,,322,4.245901639344262

5348721,5,B009LDCXNY,"This season has been a beautiful but soul-crushing journey. (""Loved it"" would be an understatement.) The purgatory story-line was magnificent - The only let-down was that there should have been more of it! And I'm so thankful that Jeremy Carver has brought back the epic mythology of seasons 4 and 5, making it one of the best seasons.

5348739,5,B009LDCXNY,It was a good season. I loved it. Couldn't wait to get the DVD set because I love watching the gag reel as much as re-watching some of my favorite and not so favorite episodes. Must have for Supernatural fans.,1382832000,,209,4.25

5348744,5,B009LDCXNY,I love this show. It is very interesting to watch because I like how they bring in the demons in each episode and it goes with the plot from start to finish. Angels are interesting too. Just how they portray each one. I didn't look at them like they do on the show and now it does make sense in maybe that is how it is.,1382745600,,319,3.8484848484848486

As a few others have commented on; I really enjoyed the theme
used when the series started out. The differant plot lines each week
were much more crisp and fresh, I still find myself going back to
earlier seasons. Not taking anything away from this but if I had
my choice, the single week after week episodes of the past were
much more enjoyable.",1382659200,,418,4.371794871794871

5348767,3,B009LDCXNY,"Gone are the days of high intensity, atmospheric Supernatural. This show was once exemplary for its adherence to actual occultism and paranormal experience, it had the dark terror and horror feeling of the Lionsgate Texas Chainsaw Masacre, and a hilarious sense of humor. Now it has more in common with ""Grimm"" (one of its more awful copycats) than it ever should. Instead of new and exciting adventures it has become almost ho hum, another predictable situation with expected solutions. Still the best show on TV which makes its loss of occult horror and adventure and unexpected and unknown situations all the harder to bare.",1382659200,4,627,5.038461538461538
5348768,5,B009LDCXNY,"I placed my order for Supernatural Season 8 DVD on October 10th.  It is now October 24 and I still haven't received it.  So I went online to Amazon to cancel the order today.  And then I get a reply email telling me it is too late to cancel because it has shipped.  So in the space of about 20 minutes, my order went from ""we are processing"" to ""we are shipping,"" and it is too late to cancel.  I never expected such poor service.  I guess if I had tried to cancel a week ago, they would still ""all of a sudden"" said that it had been shipped.  I ordered a 30# bag of dog food at the same time I placed this order, and it arrived within 4 days.  But a little thing like a set of DVD's takes over 10 days (or more)? What ridiculous customer service.

But on a more positive note, Supernatural is an amazingly well done show!  Good scripts, awesome cast, good direction.  I didn't come across this show until the 7th season, and I am trying to watch the other seasons so I can catch up.  The problem is that I can't watch one per week or even one per day.  I have to watch at least 3 in a row, so lots of chores aren't getting done at my house! It's addictive.  Sam and Dean are awesome! Castiel isn't to hard on the eyes either.

5348774,4,B009LDCXNY,"Just watched the entire series - loved it!!  It's fun and captivating.  The plot sounds silly but somehow they make it interesting.  I'm an atheist and if you had told me that I'd really enjoy a tv show which relies heavily on the Bible, I'd have thought you were crazy.  In this show it's more of a reference book.

Love the actors. They manage to pull this plot off and they're really easy on the eyes. The sense of humor of the writers is truly enjoyable. Eg;  an angel gets injured and when you see his wings they're all damaged and scraggly.  Lots of things you have to look for and sometimes watch the episodes multiple times.

It's gory but I don't mind that.  It's not for kids, imo.",1382400000,,691,4.294573643410852

5348790,4,B009LDCXNY,"Well lets start with the technical stuff.  Packaging and discs are as usual well done.  Good quality audio and no skips in the discs.

Content is ok if not awesome.  All 23 episodes are good and most have a deleted scene you can watch but nothing real special.  The commentary on some episodes just isn't that good.  I kept wondering why they bothered to record it.

The show itself seems to have come full circle.  In the first years you have the monster of the week where Sam and Dean go find a monster figure out what it is and after almost losing a fight kill it.  In the middle years like from 3 to 5 the show got a little difficult by really screwing with its take on Christianity.  Still well written and very believable.  Years 6 and 7 not so much.  The show had lost its identity and the writers seemed to be scrambling for content,  Well in year  8 I thin k we have the best so far.  We are back to the monster of the week which I really enjoy and a subplot that spans the entire year without infringing to much on the weekly story.  The show has really embraced the flashback style where you can tell two stories in the same episode.  That style is becoming a lot more popular with todays sophisticated audiences.

All in all if you love Sam and Dean (And the Impala) it is well worth the money.",1382313600,,1306,4.19758064516129

Dean and Sam's relationship has matured. Dean has grown into greater acceptance, patience, and compassion. Sam has found hope for a different future without demon blood or madness. Castiel is back, as cute a player as ever; the King of Hell explores new dimensions to his personality; and one of our favorite minor characters played by one of our favorite actresses, Felicia Day, is back for two shows!

The story line is good and so far there is nothing in the development of the story or characters that would make me stop watching the series.  I have enjoyed the re-introduction and development of the character of Benny and his complicated relationship with Dean.  It's refreshing to see Dean with another partner.  This series has been solidly interesting throughout its 8/9 year run, and not many series can say that (including ""True Blood"" which is nowhere near that 8 year mark).

5348904,4,B009LDCXNY,"I like this series...wait, let me rephrase that...I LOVE this series.  That being said, this was not my favorite season, though it had its high points and the season finale had me watching in wonder.  Sam and Dean and their relationship is, of course, still the focus of the show and how can you not love Castiel, the fallen-unfallen-fallen-bad guy-wannabeGod-crazy-good guy angel.  I think Castiel is one of the best characters ever created in sci-fi/fantasy tv.  Of course, I could be biased there.  Just a little.

I might have found the finale a tiny bit underwhelming, if not for the conclusion of the Scribe of God/Castiel plotline...and all of the potential this creates for the next season.  Watching those final moments of the last episode really got me right back into why I started watching ""Supernatural"" in the first place--the ability to awe based on emotional investment in the lives of Sam and Dean and Castiel and on the huge world-changing events that they end up embroiled in.  Heaven.  Hell.  Purgatory.  Earth.  I never knew at the end of the season where they stopped the End of the World where this show would go, and they keep on (generally) delivering...

SPOILERS:

I found some of the plot lines of Season 8 a bit boring, in particular how many flashback scenes we were subjected to re Sam and his girlfriend when he quit hunting after Dean was blasted into Purgatory.  I did like how he decided, much as Dean did, that the ""normal"" life was not for him in the end.  This was a nice bookend to Dean's similar realization, but I think they just dwelled on it a bit too much.

In the first watching, I didn't like the friendship Dean had with Benny, the vampire he met in Purgatory and brought back with him, and the troubles it caused with Sam.  But upon a second watching, I realized that I liked Benny more than I had at first and that this friendship shows that, more than anything, Dean's experiences in Purgatory changed him, especially considering how he had reacted previously to Sam's friendship with a ""monster.""

Kevin is still a hoot and I enjoy seeing Garth, not a perfect replacement for Bobby by any means, but also an interesting character in his own right.  Plus, of course, seeing Charlie again is always wonderful; what a charming female addition to the show and I hope she appears in the next season, as well.

Then we get into the meat of the show, with the Quest to close the gates of hell and the introduction of the Men of Letters...this kind of brings things full circle as we realize that the specialness of the Winchesters didn't just come down the bloodline of their mother, a Campbell, but from the Winchesters, as well.  I'm not yet sure what I think of their discovery of their own version of a ""bat-cave"" secret hideout, but I think that this show definitely needs some kind of Quest in each season...something that has been missing on occasion.

This season may not have been perfect and certainly didn't high the high-high points like the Lucifer-Michael End of the World storyline...but this show is still good, still going, and I still like it.  Lots.  Can't wait to see the next season.",1381276800,,3148,4.649186256781194

5348942,5,B009LDCXNY,"After an enjoyable season six, I personally thought Supernatural went off the rails in season seven. Thankfully, former writer Jeremy Carver was brought back to run the show, and I think he saved it. The writing is sharper and funnier, there's a renewed sense of purpose, and the mythology goes to a new (very interesting) place. There's numerous plot threads running through the entire season, and flashbacks are used in a very effective way. The DVD is great - there's three lengthy featurettes that include the cast/writers, three commentaries, and the standard gag reel.

5349003,5,B009LDCXNY,"If you have not seen this season, don't read this review, it contains many spoilers.
This season of Supernatural is really two seasons, the first half and the second half. The first half was a continuation of season 7, which I found slow paced and somewhat tedious at times. I'll be honest, I never connected at all with the characters of Benny or Amelia. I appreciate what Benny did by getting Dean out of purgatory, and then Sam, but he just didn't have any strong storylines or any real reason to be here, other than to give Sam and Dean something else to bicker about. And as for Amelia, the only reason she was there was to give Sam someone to mope to about his life. Plus, I lost a LOT of respect for Amelia when she found out her husband was still alive, and she STILL sleeps with Sam after learning that. What a slut! Nothing against the actors who played those characters, but I just think there was no reason to see them as much as we did if they weren't going to do more for the story. So I didn't shed a tear when Benny went back to purgatory, or when Amelia faded away.

Then, in the second half of the season, the boys finally got down to business. I really enjoyed the three trials, it was awesome to finally SEE a hellhound, and I think that the 'Men of Letters' was a great new addition to the show. I think their 'Batcave' headquarters is a great idea. It gives them a home, finally, after years of cheap hotel rooms. The closest thing the boys had to a home in the past was Bobby's house, which was burned down. I'm looking forward to having them explore around their new headquarters a lot more in season 9. We've only seen a little bit of the place; there are plenty more rooms for the boys to discover. They haven't even figured out where the electricity is coming from yet.

As for how the season ended, I thought it was very good; I really like the addition of Abaddon, and it's very interesting that all the angels got kicked out of Heaven. Will this be enough to bring God into the picture? I have a little bit of reservation at Dean not allowing Sam to sacrifice himself to close the gates of Hell forever. It seems like the boys would have been prepared to make that sacrifice. Also, Castiel is powerless again? Didn't we do this before in Season 5? I'll go on record now as saying I wouldn't be surprised at all to see the reappearance of Michael, Lucifer, or both, seeing as how they are two of the most powerful characters in the Supernatural universe. Crowley may have been content to let Lucifer stay in his cage, but Abaddon, being a knight of Hell, handpicked by Lucifer, may not go along with this. Anyway, I'll be watching my tv when season 9 comes on the air.",1380758400,,2697,4.307086614173229

5349005,5,B009LDCXNY,"Season 8 premieres eith Dean in purgatory and with the suspense from season 4 when he was in hell you get a excited amd anxious to see how things will play out! A new character is introduced Benny the southern, sexy vampire! Helps Dean escape from Purgatory and plays quite well  in a few latet episodes. Dean being set free goes off to find Sam only to discover he has a whole new life  with a nee lady. Which i personally fimd wonderful because Dean gt to experience a ""Normal"" life when Sam tricked the devil and went to hell. Season 8 reunites the 2 brothers back again to fight as a family and as the season goes on thrill fills your body because of the suspense and wonder that continues fr the show. Near the end you start to see the love and care the brothers have.for eachother and the knowing there doing things right.

5349019,4,B009LDCXNY,"After literally forcing my way through the last season I am glad to see that the writers of Supernatural have finally, FINALLY changed things up a bit.  Ever since the arrival of Cass and his heavenly host, the show became a bit monotonous- angels, the devil, Crowley, Lilith- I was getting tired of them (not Cass, though- too loveable)!  The first few episodes of Season 8 had some of those same themes, but later, much to my delight, things change for the better.  I don't want to ruin anything with accidental spoilers, but it's safe to say that I'm seeing Sam and Dean in a different light this season and I like it!

The actors are great, the story-lines are (mostly) great, the guest/recurring actors are great... It's going into Season 9, fairly good chance of a 10th. Here's hoping they hit their 200th episode!!!

5349063,4,B009LDCXNY,"I am picky and don't watch a lot of TV.  But this series captivated me from episode 1.  It has it all.  Plenty of comedy (episodes strictly for that) and of course horror; but it also has realist human drama, a refreshing and revolving cast, characters that aren't static, points where they poke fun at themselves. Although in every right it is a soap opera - it isn't soap opera-ish (over acted, unrealistic pathetic and boring characters).  This show blends it all, futuristic, horror, deep relationships, sincerity, drama, comedy, and self-effacing which makes it even more real.  Is every episode a home run?  No.  But very close.  I don't know why this isn't on HBO, or other paid channels - but selfishly I am glad that it isn't!

Supernatural is Quality writing, directing, and of course - very important, acting which too is high quality.",1379376000,,846,4.779310344827586

But to the Producers of the show - never, EVER change the car or the music!",1379376000,3,398,4.364864864864865

5349066,4,B009LDCXNY,I love the show and have been addicted since the first episode that I saw on Netflix.  I purchased season 8 because it isn't available on Netflix yet and season 9 begins in October so I wanted to be caught up on all the episodes.  The final episode of season 8 was the best episode of the whole season.  I can't wait for season 9 to begin.  The video quality was outstanding.  I downloaded it on my blu-ray and it was extremely clear even though I only purchased the SD version.,1379289600,,478,4.208791208791209
5349067,5,B009LDCXNY,Enjoyed all of the episodes.  The whole series is simply fun!  It's something both my husband and I watch together.,1379289600,,115,4.7
5349078,2,B009LDCXNY,"I have watched the show from the beginning and have always loved it.  However, this season was, for me, the worst and I have to admit that although I bought the DVD (to round out my collection), up until watching it, I hadn't even watched the last two episodes that were saved in my TV recordings.  The Men of Letters angle was a good one, but the whole Naomi angel manipulation stuff was nonsensical and added nothing to the show. The bunker is great but anyone with any imagination would have explored the entire thing right after first finding it - it wouldn't have taken months before they found room 7B and the hidden dungeon so for Sam and Dean to explore those areas toward the end of the season was so out of character for them.

While I admit I haven't been a huge fan of the Castiel character (after his initial couple of seasons), this year the character arc seemed to serve no purpose and made no sense.  If feels like the writers are just trying to find something to do with the character, since a lot of fans like him, rather than figuring out a way to make him an integral part of the show - from trailing bees/making honey/general insanity last year to sitting in Biggersons all over the country this year to ""protect"" the tablet which was easily taken from him was just plain ridiculous. I watched the special feature about Cas but wasn't that impressed with their explanations - basically it boiled down to Cas has always been a flawed angel.  Well if that is the case why in world would he have been sent to get Dean out of hell in the first place - seems like a job for an unflawed angel if Dean was so important to heaven.

And why change the mythology - for example, you can't hear a hellhound unless you are close to the end of your deal, but in the episode where the hellhound was killed it seemed that almost everyone could hear it (and clearly not everyone sold their soul).  The ranchhand, who did sell her soul, claimed she knew nothing about the 10 yr end of the deal, but she somehow just knew the beast was coming for her - HOW?  Also why would Sam and Dean re-animate Abidon and then just walk away leaving her to her own devices.  With all their knowledge and experience, they would know to never leave one of the most powerful demons alone even if she were in a devils trap. How stupid was it of them to bring her back at all.  Even if Crowley was making it hard to find a demon, most likely they could have found a better way to get one rather than bringing her back.  The writers took a big short cut there since they wanted her back to fight Crowley and presumably take over hell for part of Season 9.

I will continue watching the show, because I am invested in the characters and there are a few good shows along the way, until it is cancelled but I hope Season 9 and any other seasons will be better than this one.",1379289600,6,2854,4.264814814814815

Okay, so at first I gave it a 3 because I wasn't impressed wih it, and the flashbacks were annoying.

Then, I gave it a 4 because after Cas came back, things got more interesting.

Then, the last few episodes and the ending were SO GOOD that I gave it 5 stars after all. That was AWESOME! Also, it's even better the second time around (so was season seven) because more questions are answered.",1379203200,,467,4.284090909090909
5349083,5,B009LDCXNY,"I have to admit when the season first began I wasn't happy. But after a few episodes the season turned into one of my favorites. I've watched this show since episode 1. Yes I was that person. This show and it's characters have taken me on so many rides. I've cried, laughed, gasped, been scared,, been pissed. I've wanted to slap all three of the main characters and then in the next scene I want to hug them. The three main actors don't just play these characters. They bring them to life. You worry about them. You truly care about them. I have to say I was dissapointed with season 7 but season 8 made up for any problems I had with 7. Jared Padalecki in particular was brilliant this season. He was absolutely heart breaking in a couple episodes. His acting has really improved as the show has progressed. Not that he was ever bad cause he wasn't. He is so good now though. I truly hope that he gets remembered when People Choice Awards comes around. He really deserves something. I really hope the show is honorred as well. Season 8 was just perfect. Thank you Jeremy Carver.",1379116800,,1080,4.405

A few episodes were a little too graphic/dark for me, but overall, it was enjoyable.  I enjoyed the newcomers (Benny) and the return of some of the previous seasons' characters (Felicia Day).  The story line was interesting and socal media comments seemed to be mostly in agreement with that.

I hope the great acting and writing continues for many years.  I'd hate to see it go.",1379030400,,509,4.478260869565218
5349089,4,B009LDCXNY,"I love Supernatural, but you could definitely tell there were different writers in the 8th Season.  In the first episodes, the dialogue between Sam and Dean seemed stiff, not peppered with obscure music or horror movie references like it usually is.  HOWEVER, this definitely improved as the season went along, with Sam and Dean seeming more like their normal characters.  I still love it!",1378944000,,389,5.046875

5349091,5,B009LDCXNY,"Yes, the quip above is Dean at his best in a series filled with clever quips and performances.

I was afraid that ""Supernatural"" might be exorcised after the rather anemic showing of season six (and it didn't help that it was facing other genre shows at the same time on other networks)but the series continues to be the ""little engine that could"".

Season seven took a strong step in the right direction with a change in leadership, some new and interesting characters.

SPOILERS:

Season seven ended with Dean being sent to Purgatory along with the leader of the Leviathans. The loss of Bobby during season seven, the introduction of the tablet with the word of God that could permanently close the gates to Hell. In the eighth season opener Dean returns from Purgatory with the help of a vampire named Benny who has changed his ways. Unfortunately Cass ended up in Purgatory as well and doesn't return with Dean.

Dean returns and finds that Sam has moved on with his life abandoning hunting. Dean convinces Sam to help him find a way to obtain the word of God, Kevin and close the gates to Hell forever. There is a price for everything in ""Supernatural"" and its quite steep for everyone involved including Cass who returns whole on the surface but is clearly very damaged beneath the surface.

END OF SPOILERS:

As with the previous seasons Warner gives us a top notch transfer with lossless audio. The exception is, of course, ""Bitten"" the found footage episode that received a mixed reaction from fans (I kind of like it for a change of pace)as it was shot on consumer grade digital video cameras but, hey, it's supposed to look that way).

We get sound tracks in Portuguese and subtitles in English, Spanish and French.

What's missing? Prior seasons included a booklet that gave you the title of each episode and credits. The booklet has been discontinued. I kind of miss that.

The special features are quite nice for this season. We get three audio commentaries on key episodes ""Hunteri Heroici"", ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Everybody Hates Hitler"".

We get a featurette on the creation of the ""found footage"" episode. ""For the Defense of Mankind"" focuses on the tablet. ""Angel Warrior: The Story of Castiel"" is a terrific featurette focusing on the character and actor Misha Collins who defined the role and made it difficult for everyone else to play an angel because, well, they pale in comparison.

We get fourteen deleted scenes from the season. We also get the usual (and fun)gag reel.

Ultraviolet access is provided to watch these episodes on your PC.

Season eight of ""Supernatural"" demonstrated that a change in producers helped revitalized the series. While there were a couple of minor stumbles along the way, season eight is very entertaining and largely consistent.

Highly recommended.",1378857600,6,2805,4.838912133891213
5349092,5,B009LDCXNY,"Supernatural is the best show ever, that is known of course, but in season 7, I felt like the writers were out of ideas, and I was afraid the show might take the downfall in script quality, but in season 8, all my worries were evaporated, the script, found again its way into our hearts, and made us feel like hunters again!

In this season, Winchesters find their own place to call ""Home"", since they find out they are the only living members of a cult named ""Man of Letters"", imagine a more snobbish way ""Hunters"" but they were more than that, anyway, Dean and Sam, found the key to their hideout, and now they stay there, but the problems cannot stop! Crowley is out there to get the Angels tablet, and the two brothers have to translate the tablet quickly, with the help of the prophet Kevin Trann,while a mysterious Metatron makes his appearence and helps Castiel close the gates of Paradise, so humanity can solve their own problems, or is he?.

5349095,5,B009LDCXNY,"Supernatural is one of the best and most underated shows on TV. Season 8 was a return to form after, solidly entertaining, but sometimes patchy seasons in seasons 6 & 7. Season 8 reinvigorated the characters of Sam and Dean Winchester and their relationship, which is key and cenrtal to the story. It launched new mythology and took the story in a direction that will see it through seasons 9 and beyond. Just when you think the show can't surprise you any more, it pulls out a finale that blows everyone away. Damn fine TV. Beautifully made. Every episode looks like a mini movie.

There was some unexpected twists and turns this season and I'm already looking forward to the next one. Sam's character makes more sense with his personality traits after this season. The only thing I would have liked would have been to see more of Castiel and Crowley.,1377734400,,432,4.481012658227848

5349160,1,B009LDCXNY,"I found season 8 to be the worst written season of this show. New show runner Jeremy Carver managed to take a fun, creepy exciting horror show and turn it into contrived melo-drama. There were a few good parts introduced such as the character of Benny and the Men of Letters storyline but Benny ended up being a plot device to create unneeded tension between the brothers and the MoL was never explored beyond the bunker set. Most of the characters were written completely out of character, established mythology was either forgotten or simply ignored, and episodes were contrived to artificially create drama instead of letting drama unfold from the situation. There was even an entire angel storyline that didn't have anything to do with the Winchesters at all. Season 8 managed to do what I thought could never be done -- completely kill my passion for my favorite show. This will be the only season of Supernatural I won't own on DVD simply because I can't bring myself to watch any of it again.",1377043200,8,999,4.714285714285714

I love the show, I love the cast and crew and characters, and sure I may have my favorite episodes or seasons but I don't hate or dislike any of them. I will say that this season in particular though did stand out, there is a lot of character development all over the board. Some of the arcs don't get completed (or are they?) how I would have liked but they're handled well enough that they don't really detract from the overall season. We see a lot of emotional moments, a lot of amazing acting and chemistry and even some new awesome characters. The finale of this season is epic and mind blowing and if it doesn't leave you a puddle on the floor then I dare say there maybe something wrong with you. This show is great, this season stands out to a lot of people who've seen it and is generally amazing and will rock your socks off. Purgatory was done in an awesome way, new characters will twist and pull you, and the overall arc really comes to a head and opens a lot, and I mean a lot of new doors.

5349206,4,B009LDCXNY,"Okay, I started watching this show because it was about two guys, in a car, killing the kinds of monsters that made me unable to watch horror films. And it was good, and therapeutic, because at the end of each episode, the scary-scary things were DEAD.

Then they brought a certain seraph into the cast and I was hook-line-and-sinkered. You might say my interest was raised from Perdition too.

Season 4: angsty, angel-y goodness.
Season 5: just keeps getting better
Season 6: not sure where they're going with this, but still worth the ride
Season 7: remembering that the series is good for many more reasons than just angels and demons.

And then I was stuck and had to buy Season 8.  So let's talk about that choice:

Does Season 8 drag in places? Yes.
Does it have stupid crap in it? Yes.
Does it have moments that make me punch the air at the WIN involved? Absolutely.
Is it so meta in spots that it hurts? You bet.
Do I love the new additions to the cast? You bet your sweet bippy. Felicia Day FTW, among others.

So why 4 stars? Because I got to the last episode and swore like a sailor. For the first time in 3 years, I have to find some way to keep following this show. THAT was worth $40.

(Also, the chance to see Castiel go seriously archangel now and again? Well worth the price of admission.)

Excuse me while I go obsessively re-watch this.",1374969600,31,1355,4.349206349206349
5349217,5,B009LDCXNY,"Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch, This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic, The characters are engaging. The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out.",1374624000,,220,5.314285714285714

5349219,4,B009LDCXNY,Supernatural has a great storyline and some awesome visual effects. The story is kinda believeable to where this is what may have happened and the way it could have turned out if we lived in parallel universe. There is a spiritual feeling to the story line later on in the show that gives you a believeable feeling like this could have happened or might happen. The actors do a great job in portraying their parts. I would recommend this show to any sci-fi enthusiast.,1374624000,,468,4.583333333333333

They don't always have the answers and things often don't go as expected, but they keep going and trying. And last, but not least, the show is not only entertaining; it makes you think. Could any of these things be real? What if . . . And if any of it could be, wouldn't you want someone down to earth to believe and help you?

5349224,5,B009LDCXNY,"I've followed ""Supernatural"" since the beginning and am still just as hooked now as I was then.  The show was one of my great favorites during my college years and provided a welcome escape from the ever-present research papers and homework assignments...  There's nothing quite like a clever urban fantasy--just ""real"" enough to be faintly plausible and just fantastical enough to fire the imagination...

Over the years, the leading actors have greatly refined their performances, and the storytellers still manage to ""up the ante"" with every season.  Perhaps one of the most commendable aspects of the show is the writers' willingness to shake things up.  Each season's finale expands and alters the show's complex mythology, leaving the audience wondering just how the next season's premiere will possibly manage to extricate the two heroes from their latest predicament.

Monsters, mayhem, angels, demons...  This show has it all!",1374364800,,935,5.363013698630137

I enjoyed this show a lot more before they started getting so deep into the demon/angel thing. Sometimes it seems like a totally different show than when it started. I really hate to say it, but I'm starting to get bored with it. I will continue watching this show until it ends because I love Sam & Dean, but I do really miss the ""good old days"".

5349241,5,B009LDCXNY,"When Supernatural first came out I watched one episode and was like ""nah"". The CG was hokey, the monster-of-the-week plotline was predictable and the only saving grace was the interactions between the two Winchester brothers but it wasn't enough.

Fastforward 8 years. A long weekend with nothing to watch and I see that the fist seven seasons are on netflix. With nothing better to do I decided to give it a shot. And OMG am I glad I did. The show has quickly become my all time favorite (sorry Buffy...). The first season left a lot to be desired, season two was an improvement,  by season three I was hooked and didn't want to do anything else. And don't even get me started on season 4!

So the show improved, I marathoned through seven seasons and was suddenly left with nothing to do. I checked amazon and there was season 8, just waiting for me to watch it.

Season 8: A fantastic season, much better than the one before. (Thanks Castiel, you make this show worth watching) And I feel like this season was in preparation of an even greater 9th season. The Winchester brothers are starting to show some character development (the first couple seasons they remained pretty stagnant but through this season their role in eachothers life seems to be developing). Dean is probably my all time favorite TV character, he's broken in all the right ways and would do anything for those he cared about.  The best episodes are clearly the ones that have to do with the over-arching plotline, but even the filler episodes are a blast (Charlie!!!). There are a few really heartbreaking episodes, the kind that leave you staring at the screen as the credits roll wondering why the writers would do this to you.

Don't wait until you can watch it for free. Supernatural season 8 is worth buying now.",1374019200,,1791,4.634069400630914

5349324,2,B009LDCXNY,"If you've already seen Season 8 and enjoyed it, I'm sincerely happy for you.  You probably don't need to read this review (go ahead if you want).

I love Supernatural.  Seasons 1-5 were incredible, and 6-7 were great.  Most people seem to have basically the same opinion, which is why the response to Season 8 surprised me so much.

For me, the most important part of a show is the characters, followed closely by consistent and natural development of their arcs and the plot arc.  I thought Season 8 was at best unsatisfactory, and at worst practically insulting to the fans, in these areas.  These are my biggest issues with the season.

1) Ignoring Amy in ""Citizen Fang""
Previously, Dean had killed one of Sam's childhood friends in front of her son because she had killed a few humans to give the blood to him when he was sick.  It was justified in a way because Dean really believed that things that kill humans do not deserve to live.  However, in Purgatory, Dean became friends with Benny (whose character was one of the highlights of the season).  Dean took the friendship seriously enough that he wanted to hear Benny out even when it seemed like he was killing again.  Sam didn't agree and wanted to kill Benny.  Even though this situation represents a reversal of what happened with Amy, Dean makes practically no attempt to explain or apologize.  Sam seems to suddenly care more about hunting than the friend he lost (what?).  Amy is barely mentioned.
This made me sick.  Amy is the most sympathetic character Dean has killed - a good-intentioned mother trying to take care of her son - and Dean ignored it because she wasn't human.  His actions were understandable in that context, but Dean clearly has changed his mind here and believes that some supernatural creatures should be treated like people.  I'm sure he still thinks that her killings justified what he did, but Sam never thought that.  For the writers to make Dean so apathetic toward Amy, as well as toward Sam, and to decide Sam's forgotten his old friend, was disgusting.  The writers' carelessness and laziness here went way too far.

2) The Trials, Benny, Amelia, and other unexplained, ridiculous, or half-finished plot lines
The three trials were very confusing to me.  Why did Sam have to kill a hellhound?  Why did Sam have to die? Is this just a really hard test or are these things necessary to close the gates of Hell?  In the past, there have been understandable ways to resolve season arcs (shooting Azazel or 'cutting of the head' of the Leviathan beast).  This seemed like the writers just wanted some interesting things to make a few episodes out of.
Benny was amazing, but his storyline went nowhere.  You'd think they would have made him part of the team, given him a role to play in closing the Gates of Hell, or...*something*.  Anything.  Bringing in an amazing character, giving him a small initial role, and then instead of expanding it, writing him out?  Are you kidding?
Amelia's story also went nowhere, but the real problem was that the 'resolution' came when she found out her dead husband had been alive the whole time.  That was pathetically lazy writing.

3)Absence of compelling supporting characters / Sam and Dean still acting like they hate each other
Ackles and Padalecki are amazing, but it was hard to watch Sam and Dean yelling at each other, and then not, and then yelling again, for most of the season.  Do I want them to be happy best friends?  Well, yes, but that wouldn't be as interesting.  Still, the tension in their relationship is like Season 1 all over again, and a show this old needs to have some gradual maturing, not just short-lived reconciliations.  However, *if* the finale brought change that lasts into Season 9, I'll be fine with the lack of growth here.  The (hopefully) bigger problem was the lack of supporting characters.  Benny had a small role, Castiel was mostly absent and mostly indecipherable until the end of the season, and Kevin and Garth do NOT add up to Bobby.  Bobby used to be there to yell some sense into Sam and Dean when they were being 'idjits'.  His unfilled shoes probably explain why all the fighting was just tiring.

4)""Sacrifice"" - The scene right before the awesome one
Another writing debacle that ruins this season for me.  The writers didn't want the gates of Hell to close because that would make Seasons 9 and 10 like a slightly grittier reboot of Everybody Loves Raymond.  Well, you know what I mean.  There are some *really* obvious ways they could have done this (e.g., a demon rescues Crowley).  There are some clever ways they could have done this.  They didn't. They decided to inform the brothers that Sam would die when he completes the trial, have Dean run to him to prevent his death, and have Sam decide to stop curing Crowley.
This is admittedly a powerful moment, but it's insane.  Not because anyone wants Sam to die, but because it's a slap in the face to the entire show.  In every episode the brothers risk their lives fighting demons.  Dean has demanded multiple times that Sam has a duty to join him instead of choosing a safer life.  Sam hasn't always loved hunting, but he's put his heart into it.  To suddenly introduce the idea that NOW (now that it's convenient for the writers) Sam and Dean won't give their lives to stop evil...I don't know how to describe how stupid this was.  The best way to handle it would have been for Sam to complete the trial and not die, for some reason beyond 'whoops, wrong trial'.  One of many good ways would have been to not introduce the dying part at all.  I understand Dean's trying to save Sam, but for Sam to leave the gates of Hell open is something that I can only explain by 'we just found out we have a Season 9, how do we derail this train?'

Those are the biggest problems I have with Season 8.  Compared to ""Bitten"", the rest of the season is a masterpiece.  But that's an isolated episode.  These things actually ruined it for me.  I wrote this review partly because I honestly felt like the show imploded this season, and I was shocked to see most people liked it better than 6 and 7.  There must be something I care about more than most fans that they didn't mind missing this year but I did.  If you loved this season ... well, I'm glad for you and we're both looking forward to Season 9.",1371686400,6,6330,4.579181494661921

Check it out, but watch a whole season before making up your mind. It is a continuing story, and my bet is after watching one season, you will be hooked, as I was. I am a senior citizen, and, although I suspect this series was aimed at a much younger target audience, I have found it very entertaining on several levels. Just don't question some of the plot twists too much. Sometimes it borders on ridiculous, but just accept it. After all, it is not supposed to be real. It's for fun.",1369872000,5,1072,4.41919191919192

5349390,5,B009LDCXNY,"This season brought the show back to what made me love it in the first place. Good story line and the bond between Dean and Sam was tested yet again and emerged tighter than ever. It also showed that Dean's greatest fear of not being able to keep Sam safe is true, so which brother is the choosen one?",1369872000,,301,4.11864406779661

With every episode  the Winchesters fight Crowley's demons to keep Kevin hidden so he can figure out the 3 trials needed to close the gates of Hell.  It is just a great ride watching each show.

5349394,5,B009LDCXNY,"The season started a bit slow, but picked up steam and ended with some of the best brotherly moments of the entire series. New showrunner Jeremy Carver has expanded the mytharc in a way that gives the series a lot of new ground to cover. Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester continue to give layered and nuanced performances. They are joined by a wonderful cast of supporting characters, including Misha Collins as Castiel, Rachel Miner as Meg, Osric Chow as Kevin Tran, Ty Olsen as Benny, Mark Sheppard as Crowley, as well as great guest appearances by Felicia Day, DJ Qualls, and Curtis Armstrong. I highly recommend this season and the whole Supernatural series.",1369785600,,699,4.882352941176471

5349426,3,B009LDCXNY,"I gave it 3 stars only because of plot and writing.  I give it 5 stars for how much i love the show.  This will not be long. I went into the ratings.  It showed that season 7 was bad. Really bad. They were not sure about season 8.  This was no surprise to me and i wrote as much. They fell victim to the same fate that House fell to. The writers of  House decided to get rid of most of the cast and wondered why the ratings took a dive and never came back. But loyal fans like me stayed with it until the very end.  Supernatural is a miracle in itself that it has made it this long. Most shows don't make it past one season.  Take ""Monday Mornings""?  I love this show. It's new. 11 episodes and they pulled the plug on it.  So we should all be grateful that Supernatural is still on. But they realized that you cant take away most of the characters that the fans love just cause you want to play an experiment in your writing. So in season 8 they brought back Bobby a little, and Castiel.  That was a start.  It was revealed in an article that many of the subjects in season 8 are all an arc to go through season 10 then end.  But season 8,they kept a close eye on and it started off well, dipped down, and they thought about pulling the plug.  The numbers went up enough anyway , just around the time some of our other favorite characters came back.  So they kept it on. I did enjoy the season although not even close to its best.  I do wish they would go back to having the brothers being really close the way they use to. they got rid of the other characters we loved because they said they wanted to get back to the feeling of Sam and Dean against the world.  But then they don't seem to write them where the two characters are comfortable with each other.  To me, it just did not feel the same or as good.  Just my opinion.  They really have to do better with season 9 or there will be no season 10.  Also the contracts up, so if they ask for a lot of money for their last year, which i think they deserve, and the station don't give it to them?  there might be no finish to the story we have come to love.  I really want the brothers to be close as family should be and one of the reasons we fell in love with the show, and they need to bring back some of the old characters we love.  just my opinion.  Lets hope they finish the story arc and go through season 9 and 10.",1369612800,3,2376,3.953684210526316

That being said, some seasons are better than others. Season eight is definitely one of the better seasons. There are some great new characters and some old favorites return.

They have different personalities but the chemistry between them totally makes this show wonderful entertainment.  The story lines are fascinating that I can't move from the TV until its over.

I have never enjoyed a show more as i have this one. I love the humor in these stories, Dean is just so funny. Sam on the more serious side until he becomes evil, then he's somewhat funny. but i miss Bobby, Bobby kept these boys inline! i wish you would bring him back. Then there is the second Meg(Rachael Miner) who i absolutely love in this show love her one liners she is so funny. And then there is Castiel who i just adore. not so much on the evil side but he's very funny at times too. the cast is just a wonderful blend of real talent it's very refreshing. I wish Geniveve would come back her and her husband worked so well together on the show, very professional. wtg guys!!! best of luck to the show and writers and all cast and crew you're very entertaining and very very talented to say the least. thank you thank you for a wonderful show...keep it coming please.

I do love this show, it's very entertaining, but really, why all the ruff swearing in the show? and why does every show out there have to show being gay is ok? IT IS NOT OK!! read the Holy Bible in leviticus it tells you how God actually feels about this. If they are going to quote parts of the Bible i wish they would do it correctly. demons and angels? to boot evil Angels? ahhhhhhh NO that's not what God does and God will NEVER just disappear when some are in heaven. that is not how he works.",1369353600,,1522,4.124579124579125

Lots of funny episodes this season and those with Charlie/Felicia Day are the best.  But where was Garth?  Also, bringing back the character Krissy was awesome.  I hope to see more of all these characters - and Bobby in Season 9.  The Brothers need their extended family to really make the show work.  This was the roughest season yet, and I wasn't sure it would be worth it, but the later half of the season pulled it together.  The last few shows, specifically with Dean and Sam's relationship repairing were perfect.",1368921600,,681,4.570247933884297

If you've never seen it before, my advice would be to start at the beginning.  This entire series is a story that has unfolded over the last eight years and watched the boys grow and mature.

As for season 8 - I liked it a whole lot better than season 7 and even season 6 for that matter.  The season 8 finale is stunning.  I don't want to give anything away, but there are twists and turns in season 8 that I did not see coming.  I just love it when they do that!  The acting is great!  You can just tell the J's are having a good time.  There were also some great guest appearances and some regulars that you will be glad to see.  I do wish there would have been more classic rock, but they did throw some in.  Hopefully season 9 will have more music.  Hey, at least the Impala is back!  For me, it is just pure entertainment.

For anyone who liked the X-Files or anything from the suspense or horror side of things, this is a fabulous show.  Great character development - characters that you understand, like and feel for.  Strong plots and subplots to always keep you interested.  Season eight was especially strong - still waiting to see the last episode next week.  I can't wait to see what loose-ends get tied up and which are ripped open to make way for a fantastic ninth season.

Paranormal is a great unheralded show!  Start watching all 175 (or so) episodes today!

Be sure to have a bag of rocksalt at the ready when watching.  Pour some out in a circle.  Stay in that circle and you'll be fine...",1368144000,,806,4.527777777777778

The first season was interesting and by the end of the first season it became extremely good and has been consistantly good ever since.

I usually wait till it comes to video because I like being able to watch without commercials and don't like waiting a week for the next episode. This year sounded so good I couldn't wait. There is a lot of attitude from both Dean and Sam. I wish they could find a way to bring back Bobby and Ellen.

What I do not like is, I have paid for the show yet the only place I can watch it is on amazon.com.

5349661,5,B009LDCXNY,"While I'm still a fan of the earlier seasons (seasons 3-5 were amazing) - season 8 is turning out to be quite interesting but would hate to see demons locked away for good - what kind of show would there be then?  Zombies or aliens? Great writing, acting and special effects - good looking leads (no surprise there - this is the CW) - interesting plot lines.  Bummed that Meg is gone though - she was terrific - her one liners were delivered with such grace, irony and vulnerability it was amazing!  Unicorns and puppy dogs for the she-demon...

Anyway, big fan of the show and glad the CW has kept it for so long...the show and the actors have grown up...and I still hold to season 5's finale (Swan Song) as one of the best shows ever on television (even better than David Tenant's swan song in the new Dr. Who).

My favorite line - ""Purgatory is Hell-adjacent...""

And one more thing - speaking of season 5 and the end of the world and all that -- I have traveled to Israel many times - still wonder why Kansas and the US and not Jerusalem and Meggido (the fields where Armageddon is supposed to take place)  is where angels and demons would fight.  Today, when you drive past the town of Meggido (it's a real town with real fields minus the bloody end-of-the-world battles) there is actually a McDonalds (a kosher one I think).  Just saying...I think that is where the big fights would take place (maybe one of the writers needs a trip to Jerusalem to learn some of that history).  Thanks for a great show!",1366329600,,1509,4.39568345323741

5349675,4,B009LDCXNY,"Started watching this television series from season 1. It is a fantastic series with a very interesting and, at least to me, unique style of script writing. If you start watching Supernatural from the first season you sill notice how seamlessly story lines are weaved into episodes throughout the seasons. The last couple of seasons seem to follow a pattern set by most long running television series in that it is starting to deviate from the strong scripting that made this series from a darker more supernatural mystery series to a more lighter cartoonish style. I hope there is more juice in the tank so that the writers can take the storylines back to the original style. Then hopefully this series can live on for several more year otherwise it will probably not be renewed after next year.",1366329600,,796,4.77536231884058

5349677,5,B009LDCXNY,"It is a show on the darker side of things, however; I do like the way they inject bits of humor here and there (with a few episodes poking fun at the characters and the show itself).

The only bad part about Supernatural the Eighth Season is that I know eventually it will come to an end.

It's a shame, because those episodes were the best -- it was like watching a gritty mini-horror film each week. Those were 5-star entertainment. Ever since the brothers got involved with angels and heaven, there are subplots piled on top of subplots and the storyline has become a bit convoluted. The ""Monster of the Week"" episodes still pop up now and again -- and some are still very well-executed -- which is why it still gets 3 stars from me.",1365811200,3,533,4.621052631578947

Now I have to wait for the episodes to air and that sucks. But, having it pop up in my Amazon Library is great. Like a little present to myself. If you have enjoyed any of the Superatural shows then this season will be enjoyable too. If you haven't ever seen it please check out the pilot and season one first. You'll quickly become an addict as well.",1365465600,,495,4.221052631578948
5349735,5,B009LDCXNY,I've been following this show since it aired on CW.  Use to be right after Smallville and was a great combination of shows.  It's come so far since they first starting looking for their Dad to now having to close the gates of hell forever.  I hope this show goes the distance and makes it to 10 seasons.  It would be great to see the show wrap at as a series finally of Sam and Dean growing old and having a normal family life like they have always wanted.  Most likely it will end with them finally stopping all evil but paying for it with their lives and maybe finally meeting God with Castiel.  Crowley needs to get his for sure.  Great bad guy but I think I like the Lucifer charter better.  He was scary but very funny at the same time.,1365465600,,741,4.1328671328671325
5349736,4,B009LDCXNY,A must see episode for fans. Very entertaining! Different take on witches and their familiars. I stopped watching this show a few years ago but heard about this episode and had to see it. I'm glad I did.,1365465600,,203,4.368421052631579

5349739,5,B009LDCXNY,"I never thought I would enjoy this type of show, but have become hooked!  I had knee surgery and was recuperating and started watching the series.
Would recommend the whole series because it has action scenes, heartfelt moments, great overall story line and the dramatic moments are very believable.  The show and actors are underrated and I wish this wasn't the case.  If more people watch this series, they would realize how underrated it has been and should be appreciated more.  I've recommended this to my brother, daughter and some friends and they have all been hooked!
Worth checking out!",1365465600,,596,4.93
5349740,4,B009LDCXNY,"Over the course of this series, it seems the writers incorporate conflict between the brothers simply for conflict's sake and it's as irritating as hell. For Sam to simply 'give up' on looking for Dean who accidentally ended up in Purgatory after killing the head leviathan), not even trying to find him, is simply unbelievable to me. However, that is the only thing I have against this season. (BTW, did we ever get a reason Sam left his girlfriend to end up at the cabin where Dean was hiding out after emerging from Purgatory? Did I miss something, or did the writers? Did he know Dean would be there, if so, how?) Anyway, the conflict between the brothers needs to end. it's been done to death, now they need to start building trust with each other, they need to start being the bantering brothers which is cool and comfortable, and Sam needs to lighten up a little, while at the same time Dean needs to (and is finally doing, I might add) realize his brother is growing up. The last few eps I've seen on Amazon Instant Video have and are building on this season's arc, and I'm very satisfied that the brothers are shaping up and finally becoming brothers... at the soul, not just by blood. The jury is out on what will happen in season 9, I'm watching closely, but from a distance. I've had the rug ripped out from under me a time or two as a result of curves being thrown at us from the writers and then not so unexpected curves, as though they take one step forward with Sam and then decide the conflict should take center stage and place him five steps back. Been there, done that, let's move on. Season 8 seems to be delivering here, but as I said above, I'm going to keep it at arm's length. I'm tired of being jerked around.  All i can say is, now that Sam has made his decision to stay with Dean, rather than pursue a 'normal' life, there's still traces of his longing for a normal life in the last two eps (18 and 19). Once again, he's falling back into an old and worn out routine. Enough. However, that being said, the fact that Sam is ailing from the completion of trials is enough to put Dean in protective mode and that is fine by me. it's great to see Dean wanting to look out for his younger brother with more feeling than I've felt in a long time. I just wish the writers would bring Sam full circle and quit having him be so indecisive. I don't know why they insist on playing the 'Sam wants a normal life' card throughout this series. If he really wanted that, he'd take off and get away from the hunting and fight to keep it that way. I'm sure there can be other conflicts within him that can be focused on. By doing this same old-same old routine, it proves the writers are lacking in vision or are not connected like they should be with Sam or Dean, for that matter, because Dean is always left being hurt by Sam's indecision. Ok, sorry for the rant, but there you are. I'm liking the last few eps, though. It's promising. Rug, stay where you are... right under my feet, thank you very much.",1365465600,,3017,4.302284710017575

5349998,5,B009LDCXNY,"I have watched this show on Netflix (as I was just introduced to it earlier this year), and am absolutely hooked. At least once per episode I laugh (literally) out loud.",1362787200,,169,4.483870967741935
5349999,5,B009LDCXNY,"This has been one of the better series of its genre in a long time.  It's well written and acted, and keeps your interest at all times.",1362787200,,135,4.0
5350020,5,B009LDCXNY,"Den & Sam get the job done . Case is thier super back up , Bobby was agreat lose , hope some way he can be brought back into the show .",1362787200,,135,3.25
5350021,5,B009LDCXNY,Better than Season Seven.  There is much more variety in this season. 8 more words required for this review.  Geez.,1362787200,,115,4.7
5350022,5,B009LDCXNY,"After a couple weak episodes early in the season, this season has taken off as one of the most exciting of the series",1362700800,,117,4.130434782608695
5350023,5,B009LDCXNY,I was worried where they would go with the new season and how they would bring the brother back together but I for one am not remotely disappointed.,1362700800,,148,4.321428571428571
5350024,5,B009LDCXNY,No matter how many seasons this show continues to go on for its always an excellent and thrilling thing to watch!,1362614400,,113,4.428571428571429
5350025,5,B009LDCXNY,"I love these characters.  Dean is sullen and tortured and doesn't make bones about the simple enjoyment of a double decker bacon cheeseburger deluxe.  Sam is the epitome of the unintentional hero.  Always wanting a different life, always choosing to stay in the fight, always for Dean.",1362614400,,285,5.0212765957446805
5350026,4,B009LDCXNY,"Like the title of my review, the eighth season is not as good as the previous ones.  This season seems to be sleepy and lying down.  The absence of the character Bobby and the cameos of Castiel without the introduction of new endearing characters seem to create a void.  So far, this season is all about Sam and Dean and lacks the chemistry of the previous seasons, along with not being quite as funny, ironic, and irreverent, breaking the rules of screen writing and poking fun at themselves and clichs.  I keep on hoping this is the proverbial calm before the storm.  Perhaps they need to bring me in as a writer?

Still, the eighth season is better than much of what is on TV, but not as good as previous seasons.",1362614400,,716,4.386363636363637
5350027,5,B009LDCXNY,The show is well written and the actors are every good. It is never boring.like the gag alsowould like to see longer gag reel.,1362441600,,126,4.291666666666667
5350028,5,B009LDCXNY,Especially since S Gr8t has led to an early renewal for S9!  :)  Supernatural is the best show on television.  J2 are the best actors in TV right now.  My only plea:  BRING BACK BOBBY SINGER!!!!!!,1362441600,,196,4.333333333333333
5350029,4,B009LDCXNY,Loveeeee Dean & Sam. I miss Bobby & Cass wish they can bring them back. I do not miss an episode.love it,1362441600,,104,3.772727272727273
5350050,5,B009LDCXNY,I believe this is the best paranormal show on TV.  I have watched Sam and Dean grow up before my very eyes and they have developed into such GREAT actors.  I can't wait for next season!!,1362441600,,186,4.138888888888889
5350051,5,B009LDCXNY,I have been watching Supernatural from the beginning.  I have purchase all seasons and have purchased them for my sister also.,1362441600,,126,5.0
5350052,5,B009LDCXNY,Supernatural is one series I've been hooked on from the start.  They've always found a way to keep the interest.  I love these boys!!,1362441600,,133,4.5
5350053,5,B009LDCXNY,"I recently started watching ""Supernatural"" on Netflix and got HOOKED. This show is addicting - so addicting I blew through all precious seasons and NEEDED this to catch up live!",1362441600,,177,4.933333333333334

5350055,5,B009LDCXNY,"Supernatural season 8 is a pleasure. After season 7, which was a let down, it is refreshing to see Sam and Dean back in business.",1362355200,,129,4.2
5350056,5,B009LDCXNY,outstanding they've kept my interest which in a series this is hard to do do do do do do do,1362355200,,91,3.6
5350057,5,B009LDCXNY,"Just when you think there is no more good things to add to the story, they surprise you with cartoons, gangsters, time travel,  and they will never die!?..",1362355200,,155,4.535714285714286
5350058,4,B009LDCXNY,Bought episode 15 and it was a solid episode.  Recommended to anyone who missed the broadcast premiere of this episode.,1362355200,,119,4.95
5350059,5,B009LDCXNY,"The story of two bothers forced to walk the line between good and evil continues, and in the Supernatural tradition established in the first seven seasons, the story's twists and turns will always surprise and sometimes even downright shock you.  Of course the idea of an entire world having co-existed right here within or own since before time even began and well populated with monsters, demons, angels and ghosts is far-fetched, but the all-too human brother's suffering, triumphs and defeats will keep you coming back to find out who made it out whole.  You'll be shocked, you'll laugh, you may even cry, if you're some kinda wuss or something.",1362355200,,649,4.944954128440367
5350090,5,B009LDCXNY,S8 is better than S6 so far. More consistent tone episode to episode and the season plot is wonderfully presented.,1362268800,,114,4.75
5350091,5,B009LDCXNY,"Hands down best supernatural series I've seen. They come as close to reality as possible, great visual and tremendous acting from Jensen Ackles, Jared Padelecki, and supporting actors.",1362268800,,184,5.607142857142857
5350092,5,B009LDCXNY,I don't usually like scary shows but I love this one.  Great Sci-Fi with hot guys! This season is one of the best since season 2.,1362268800,,129,3.9615384615384617
5350093,5,B009LDCXNY,"This show is awesome.  The characters are great.  The writing is great.  I think the thing I like the most is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and never seems afraid of a little twisted self-referential humour.  Also, Dean/Castiel 4EVER.",1362182400,,247,4.951219512195122
5350094,5,B009LDCXNY,I love this series and can not wait for the next one. These guys rule and are so so cool man,1362182400,,92,3.4285714285714284
5350095,5,B009LDCXNY,The subject line pretty much covers it.  Been 2 (or 3?) episodes with no Cass or Crowley which is disappointing.  Both actors and characters are great. A little stretching on a couple of plots but overall a vast improvement over season 7.  Hope the boys aren't getting tired of their jobs.  ;-)  Here's to looking forward to season 15.  Best show on TV.,1362096000,,353,4.523809523809524
5350096,5,B009LDCXNY,"I just started watching supernatural about two months ago and I'm already caught up to the current episode. Honestly I cant get enough of this show and love the relationship between Sam, Dean, and Cass.  Every episode is something different and eventhough it's the same storyline, it never gets old. This is my favorite show of all time.",1362096000,,337,4.810344827586207
5350097,5,B009LDCXNY,"After all these years the boys are still fun, fresh and kick ass. Great addition to the cast is Benny, hope he shows up again. My husband loves the show for the great stories, humor, scares and charcters.
I love it for the same reasons but confess I have a middle aged woman crush on the supernaturally handsome brothers in the story! I mean seriously, it should be a crime for two men to be that drop dead sexy.....ok I'll stop now.
I think there is something for everyone from this show but start from season one because the character development over the seasons is very important, lots of plot twists and I think you will enjoy the other characters as well.
Even the evil ones have a twisted sense of humor.",1362009600,,711,4.393939393939394
5350098,5,B009LDCXNY,It's quick and so easy to do. It downlods real well and the picture and sound are great. And if used with amazon unbox it's that much better.,1362009600,,141,4.071428571428571
5350099,5,B009LDCXNY,Supernatural is a very addicting series.  I have not missed one episode.  It just keeps getting better and better.  I will be very unhappy when they make their final season which I hope won't be for quite some time.,1362009600,,215,4.461538461538462
5350119,5,B009LDCXNY,"It's supernatural! I love anything to do with the paranormal/supernatural. Particularly anything with ghosts but demons, demi gods, angels, pergatory, etc etc rules too",1361923200,,168,6.041666666666667
5350120,1,B009LDCXNY,I did not order. I removed the entire season from my watch list and was still billed for every episode. I am very disgruntled.,1361923200,2,126,4.291666666666667

5350122,5,B009LDCXNY,"This season is close to the best yet.  Sam and dean continue to  show their talent, continue to be interesting.  Although I'd live to see more episodes devoted to new monsters and challenges, this seasons plot proves much more palatable than season sevens  drudgery with Leviathan.  If you enjoyed early season three you'll love this seasons second half of shows, from episode ten on..",1361836800,,385,4.953125
5350123,5,B009LDCXNY,"It's a good show.
Amazon makes it easy to have entire seasons without all the dvd packs to lug around every time you move.",1361836800,,122,4.125
5350124,5,B009LDCXNY,"I chose this rating because unlike iTunes, Amazon Instant Video does not require a download time before you can start watching your episode. Also, I've never experienced a lag problem with AIV like I have with iTunes.",1361750400,,217,4.891891891891892
5350125,5,B009LDCXNY,"I have to say I'm so picky about what I watch, especially if it's fictional, but Supernatural is truly amazing, captivating, funny, sad, scary, dark, yet light, full of emotions, and at the same time, full of information. I've been a Paranormal Investigator for years, and have been to some pretty dark places, but had awesome experiences. So I guess you could say ""The Dark Side"" does intrigue me, but this series covers it all! Sam and Dean have such chemistry, and then when you add Bobby and Castiel........It's just priceless! I'm buying the entire set just to have it! I don't do that too often!",1361664000,,601,4.679245283018868
5350126,5,B009LDCXNY,Supernatural is very engaging and fun to watch.  Jared & Jensen are like real brothers and work great together.  Love it - one of my favorites.,1361664000,,143,4.461538461538462
5350127,5,B009LDCXNY,"Season 8 has had some great stand alones but still a strong central arc with Crowly and Kevin in the background. Sometimes out of sight but never really out of mind. I'd like to see Cas a little more but at least he shows up more than last year. The Felcia Day episode was a real stand-out as well as the Looney Tunes ep. All in all a much better season that last year.

Off topic...has anyone seen the book cover for ""Wilder:The Chosen One"" by Christina Dodd? You're on Amazon now, take a look at it. Definitely Sam Winchester. Maybe some new money making scheme for the boys? Male cover models for supernatural (what else) romance novels?",1361491200,,640,4.423728813559322
5350128,4,B009LDCXNY,"More of the same, including more angst from Sam and secrets from Dean. Overall pretty good but how many more times can these guys get brought back from hell?",1361491200,,157,4.448275862068965
5350149,5,B009LDCXNY,"I've been watching this series since it began and enjoying every minute of it. Love the boys and all the twists and turns with demons, gods, you name it, but the angel angle was inspired and casting Mysha Collins as their ""guardian angel"" sealed the deal.",1361404800,,255,4.565217391304348

5350152,5,B009LDCXNY,"Right off the bat, I miss Bobby! But the story lines are still as good as ever, and Jared and Jensen can't be topped for their true to life performances. Can't believe how close to this day and age this story line rides, which makes it all the more entertaining. The writters always come through on the story lines, it's clean enough for all ages and there isn't anything out there like it. Really like the moments of comedy too.

Who would have thought of modern day heroes given everything else there is, I'm really glad someone did. And this is my favorite show.",1361318400,,565,4.4326923076923075

5350155,5,B009LDCXNY,"I and my husband have been a fan of Supernatural from episode one, but the show lost alot of it's grit in seasons six and seven. It became painful to watch the required ten minutes of them talking about their feelings, and it seemed like one of them was always crying. I am happy to report that season eight seems to be a return to the old days, feeling much like season four. There's alot of slow build-up, plenty of off-canon episodes, and best of all there's like no crying. We also are hearing the seventies and eighties songs again, which was always one of my favorite things. The show is being headed by a new person now, and it is obvious and much better. The bottom line is if you liked this show several years ago but gave up on it, now's the time to pick it back up.",1361232000,2,776,4.18

5350157,4,B009LDCXNY,"If you like SUPERNATURAL, the eighth season will not dissapoint. New monsters are introduced, and ultimate forces of good and evil continue thier epic battle. The show retains its sense of humor and fun pop culture satire, and Sam and Deans characters are deepened and developed. I recommend this show for anyone with a slightly dark sense of humor or an intrest in the mythology of angels and demons.",1361145600,9,401,4.826086956521739
5350158,1,B009LDCXNY,"I think that this show should have ended with season 5. Eight season is the worst season so far. It is as if actors forgot how to act, dialog seems forced and artificial and all of the jokes are flat and predictable. Back story is weak as well.",1361145600,,244,4.104166666666667
5350169,5,B009LDCXNY,This program is great to watch.  The relationship between brothers is very interesting and their adventures together make it fun.  I enjoy the humor that happens once in a while in the episodes and look forward to the next chapter at the end of each episode.,1361145600,17,258,4.586956521739131
5350170,5,B009LDCXNY,I LOVE season 8 so much! It's awesome!! I can rewatch each episode as many times as I want. What's not to love?,1361145600,,111,3.869565217391304
5350171,5,B009LDCXNY,This is the best show I have watched in a long time.  Totally kicks other shows butts!!  This season rocks just like the other 7.  So glad we spent the money with Amazon to watch it while we wait for season 9!,1361145600,,209,3.9285714285714284

always looking forward to the next show
hope there is a season nine!",1361145600,,125,4.25
5350174,4,B009LDCXNY,A well written story line. A modern day odd couple of two brothers that are opposites but share a common bond when it comes to eliminating the world's evil. This is an engaging and worthwhile show. I seldom watch television anymore as most of it is poorly written and rides on what ever the latest craze happens to be. This show has stayed very fresh and engaging for 8 years. My congratulations to the cast and their writers.,1361145600,,426,4.4743589743589745

5350176,4,B009LDCXNY,I thouroughly enjoyed all the Supernatural seasons even though it does get a little blasphemous from time to time. I highly recommend starting at the beginning with season 1. This said the 8th season is on par with the previous seasons with the exception of a beloved character that is killed off and replaced with a one that is inadequate for the role.,1361145600,,353,4.619047619047619
5350177,5,B009LDCXNY,I am not great with providing a written opinion but I will say that this series is worth seeing from 1 - 8.  If not just for the excellent humor and bantering between brothers.,1361145600,,176,4.176470588235294

Appreciate it for what it is, entertainment of a specific type.  Also gave it the five stars because I forget to hit the record button and miss episodes of the current season and being that not all episodes are available for free this is a great option to catch-up.

Just one thing... feel sometimes it's getting a little too serious, so bring back the funny. That twisted humor melded with the scary and the gory is the secret ingredient to this show. Great lines...

The first 5 seasons were fantastic, and it hasn't quite been the same since, but I have to see it through (because it was that good).  The writing is not as imaginative, and it often gives the impression they are trying too hard to be more gory, a little too hard to be as funny as in seasons past, and just missing the mark a bit on compelling story lines.",1359936000,,475,4.1521739130434785

I miss Bennie and I hope they bring him back in the near future. He brought out the best in Dean and we really haven't seen that aspect of his character before now.

5350339,4,B009LDCXNY,"The beginning of the season has scenes from purgatory that are more dramatic and action packed than most of the show's comical roots usually go and i enjoyed it. Benny, a character from purgatory (vamp) adds alot to the interesting story line although the later episodes in season 8 start to get cheesier just as most seasons of this series have done. I love the classic rock intro on alot of the episodes and the comedy aspect is great, but the series has a habit of going off-topic for 2-3 episodes each season and then picking up the main story..........which is boring alot of times. I got the season pass so the some of the later episodes getting cheesy was dissapointing after the great start. I fear the show will eventually lose pace with fans due to this inconsistency in story lines and the general habit of going off the main story so much each season. Overall i'd watch this over gossip girls any day due to the fact that i am a straight male with no homo tendencies, lol.",1359504000,,984,4.472222222222222

In terms of cast, production, writing, VFX, and overall superior quality in all things, it is not to be missed.

5350348,4,B009LDCXNY,"First of all I am happy they have increased the episodes that Misha (castiel) is involved in. Am I the only person who thinks that Cas added alot to the series when he was introduced! He became like both a naive young brother and knowledgable older brother to both winchesters, and has become more one of the winchester family than 'the angel'. This allows him to be involved in stories beyond the angel/deomen storyline.

That is the first downside i have to this series. there is very little of the old interaction between castiel and the brothers. they got to a very relaxed place at one point and now they are almost behaving like they did in series four. with the loss of Bobby you would have thought that the directors would have used him more.

My biggest problem with this series though is Benny. He is a good actor, but come on! a friendly vampire! isn't that a bit overdone at this point. Supernatural has always done inventive (if strange) stories, which have helped it stay on so long. But now it is reduced to a friendly vampire!
 Leave it alone please!!!!
I thought that this show at least would chart its own course and not fall in with the fads that everyone else is following.

I understand that at the end of the day the show needs to evolve and introduce new characters into its world, after all how many times can we watch Sam and dean argue with each other! But The show needs to stick the character of Benny in the bin, stop killing off (or reducing the time of) every single well loved character on the show, and then it might get back to its best.

I still enjoy Supernatural and will continue watching it as long as they keep the standards as high as they are now. This series is well worth watching. I just think that with a few simple adaptations they could get the show from great back to the amazing it once was.",1359158400,,1841,4.371345029239766

Our latest is Supernatural.  We love it!  Neither of us are fans of the gory squishy splitting body scenes.  We look away, but the sounds!!  Anyway, while I've seen some reviewers who are disappointed that it isn't all gory action and wild special effects, it appears we're in the majority when we say that we simply love the complete package.  The story lines are great.  We really miss Bobby. But aside from that really awful part, the show remains fresh and new with each episode. We're almost caught up now and have been buying Season 8.  In a vain attempt to try to keep it from ending, we're watching more Primevil than Supernatural for a bit.  But those last 5 episodes are calling to us and we'll get to the ""watch one a week"" part all too soon.

The old scripts were pretty good and aside from a few episodes (ghostchasers) they were clever. Now, however, there are more stupid episodes than good ones. Dean and Sam seem to be just coasting through the episodes. The loss of Bobby and his subsequent replacement with ""Garth"" (oh God why...if there were ever a annoying character it is him) was a stupid move.

Its like Days of our Lives thrown in and a cheap and easy way of filling up space. These guys are suppose to be hunters killing supernatural beings - the story now has such a formulate to it. Surely the producers and writwrs can be more creative in giving viewrs more entertainment value with unusual beings and creatures appearing. Something new and exciting. The characters are becoming older and the show is looking tired and has very little bang - special effects are old from series 3 and 4. i now watch a bit of a show or just switch it off.,1358812800,2,661,4.338709677419355

5350371,5,B009LDCXNY,"Almost half-way through Season Eight and I'm still guessing as to whether Amanda is Good or Evil.  Or if there is such a thing as Good;  maybe it's all nasty corporate politics and everyone and everything is evil or not quite as evil with a few truly Evil creatures thrown in.  And the only thing the boys can rely on is each other (as they are once again back to a dangerously co-dependent relationship.)  Castiel is under Naomi's thrall, would kill the boys in an instant if she told him to, and I can definitely see a possibility of that happening.  So, back to Amanda being evil or not so evil...

Like the previous seasons, the underlying storyline is interesting and they cast the perfect actress to be the (possibly) evil controlling character.  Amanda Tapping is a very versatile actress and a joy to watch.",1358726400,,815,4.5793103448275865

We have had episodes in the past where the Winchester brothers were not central stage (Ghostfacers, Weekend At Bobby's, etc.),those episodes had other qualities that made them very worth the time to watch. ""Bitten"" is, in short, a waste of film. Yes, the brothers do appear in several shots and give a short analysis of what they think might be happening. This episode however, does not stand up to the quality of the Supernatural brand. I am voicing my own oppion on this, watch it and evaluate it for yourself.

When it started the 8th season cable vision didn't run channel 11 so I missed supernatural and vampire diaries.  I was happy that amazon had the shows I missed, but 1.99 is a lot of money for one show.  Not only that the shows I missed were repeated in December 2012.  I didn't notice until after I paid  $6.00 for the 3 episodes that they were repeated in dec. which I taped.  I will be more careful next time.  Amazon should charge $1.00 per episode.  It would be  cheaper to wait and buy the whole series then just episodes.  Well anyway I enjoy Supernatural  and I rate the series 5 stars.",1357603200,,670,4.365853658536586

I have the entire collection at home and intend on buying Season 8 as soon as it is available on DVD.  There are some touchy issues in the series if you are a Christian.  I try to keep an open mind and realize that the program is fictional, not factual.",1357516800,,329,4.109375
5350457,5,B009LDCXNY,"Although, I don't love the eighth season as much as some of the earlier seasons, the show still has it's foundation intact.  The strong family bond between the Winchester Brothers.  There is always some kind of monster to fight, and that the writers can still find great storylines it amazing.  Love the cast and crew!

I love the back stories of purgatory and Sams attempt at a normal life. Great to see Castiel back, we knew he would be though, I mean he as become as integrel a character as Bobby, which I waiting to return also.  There is also new interesting characters like Garth(love him) and Benny to add some new flavor and keeps it from getting stale. This show has always been more about the people and relationships than battling the Supernatural and I think this is what keeps most of us coming back for more.",1357257600,,652,4.4789915966386555

I was expecting to be able to play it through my tv but found that when I streamed it through my computer to my tv the picture got jerky at times. Netflix streaming is significantly better and smoother. I had high hopes for Amazin to get in the streaming market but they just aren't there yet. Downloading and watching videos works great.

I am quite pleased with the way the show is going, especially after Bobby is gone. That is a character that will always be irreplacable. I still stand by my view that nothing can be as good as the first five seasons, but I am happy that the creators are able to keep my interest and have stuck to the character developement of the Winchesters.

5350574,5,B009LDCXNY,"... Yeah the review title is a little lame.. but I didn't know what else to call it.

(Contains spoilers)

Like many of the previous reviewers, I had my reservations about the Season so far, although I was still very much enjoying every episode. (Not so much the ""Bitten"" episode)
I liked the inclusion of Kevin, and his mother... Mark Sheppard's continued appearance, and the return of the ""monster of the week"" structure.
I also thought it was somewhat unorthodox, and intriguing, the way to go about revealing past events concerning Dean and Sam, through flashbacks revealed in every episode.

With that said, the episode ""Hunteri Heroici"" has become my favorite episode.  I was thrilled with Misha Collins return as Castiel! (Yay! :D)  Better yet,
being the ""third wheel"" (haha, that part makes me chuckle) to the dynamic duo that is Sam and Dean.  This episode contains a plethora of wit and humor, which I very much adore and is done so perfectly well by the trio, and overall I am thankful and excited to see Castiel, Dean and Sam together again.

However, I am -very- surprised with the introduction of Amanda Tapping as ""Naomi"". (This was actually revealed in the previous episode but I felt it worth mentioning here)
Amanda Tapping! Seriously? And I thought this show couldn't get any better! Wow!  I have been a major fan of her since Stargate SG-1.
I digress...
All in all, I am ecstatic to watch such a wonderful ensemble of my favorite actors continue to improve upon and polish the Supernatural series.  Bravo, the cast members, writers, producers etc are doing a magnificent job.  Please keep up the good work!  (Now hopefully Jim Beaver comes back as a regular or recurring guest :D!!!)",1354406400,,1703,4.7979452054794525
5350575,5,B009LDCXNY,I've seen every episode of Supernatural and I'm very excited to see them continuing the story. They are doing a great job of getting involved with each character in every episode. Sam and Dean are great role models for what they believe is right and I like how they never let that go. I hope to see more seasons in the future.,1354320000,,326,4.274193548387097

5350594,5,B009LDCXNY,"Sure demons may seem like ""old news,"" but just because they haven't been a primary adversary doesn't mean they weren't always the bad guys. They were from the start and it's fitting that once we're done with sideline baddies, we get back to the people who have been the enemy since the show started. I also like that we're revisiting Sam's dream of quitting. It's something we've all known he's wanted to do since the beginning. This season I think issues and enemies of the past are being looked at with more seriousness behind the decisions that are made regarding each of them. With each season the show feels more and more mature, especially since season 6 (my favorite season by far). I look forward to seeing this season unravel. The more the show grows, the more I love it.",1353715200,,780,4.578571428571428

What sets this show apart from most of the fodder on TV is the fact that they actually TRY to incorporate simple plot devices, and they make a sincere effort at character development.

But as much as I'm loving the story as it continues to unfold with each episode, I have grown super weary of Sam's whiny B attitude.  It's almost like he wants to say to Dean, ""I was happy and you ruined it by fighting your way back!"" Waa waa waaaaa! If anyone should be angry it should be Dean.  He spent a YEAR in PURGATORY!  And if you want to do the degrees of separation thing, it was Sam's fault!  Like Dean pointed out through the anger of the specter, Sam drank the demon blood, that made the angels have to come to try to stop him from killing Lilith, which brought Lucifer topside, which lead to all the other crap that happened from Season 5 to the present.  Dean had no childhood, no life period because he has always been tasked with keeping Sam from crashing and burning, yet that whiny cretin can't even break Dean off a little slack for getting out of Purgatory the best way he could.  Like Dean said - albeit spurred by the wrath of the specter - Sam betrayed and deserted him, Cass did much of the same; the only being he has found thus far who seems to be trustworthy in spite of his ""condition"" is ironically, Benny, the ""vampirate,"" whom I agree has a ""creepy [sexiness]"" about him.  And as much as Sam is whining about missing Amelia, I can't help but be suspicious that she's going to turn out to be a demon-laced romantic distraction planted by Crowley to keep Sam FROM looking for Dean, arguably the most formidable hunter ever.  They ALL fear Dean.

I have heard that the Winchester story was initially planned to be told in 10 chapters/seasons.  I just pray the rest of this season and however many more we are lucky enough to get, sees someone straight jack Sam and make his whiny butt look Dean in the face and acknowledge his sacrifice, the least of which was NOT him being shredded by hellhounds and spending 40 years in HELL because he wanted Sam brought back to life.  Sack up Sam and get over yourself!!",1352419200,,2155,4.3283582089552235
5350649,5,B009LDCXNY,"Season 8 gets off to a terrific start.  I had a knee jerk reaction of feeling jipped at first in having the season start out with Dean's escape from Purgatory but the flashbacks were quick to come and very well done.  They immediately set the tone for just what kind of year Dean had. It was urgent, bloody and dangerous. Then we flash to Sam leaving behind a woman and a dog.  There are flashbacks for him as well only they are of a very different kind in comparison to Dean's.  I personally don't mind the whole time jump thing. Its an effective way to get the boys back together but still give us the history of their year apart.  The introduction of Benny was wonderful (and great casting) and I look forward to more of that particular back story emerging.  I'm betting there is more to Sam's year than what we've been shown and am willing to wait and let the writers unravel his story.

There has been conflict between the brothers since the beginning when Sam wanted to return to Stanford, Jess and a normal life and Dean wanted nothing more than to continue the family business.  A LOT of stuff has happened in between but it seems they are coming full circle with Sam wanting out again and Dean a more dangerous and effective hunter than he's ever been.

It's great to see Misha Collins back as Castiel and his fate in Purgatory has yet to be revealed.  I like the peek we've been given so far - Castiel leaving Dean to protect him, Dean refusing to leave without him.

There is something unique about each season and I look forward to watching how this one unfolds and hopefully leads to another.",1352160000,,1605,4.406779661016949

We do not tune in to see a few no name actors plod their way through a mediocre script with fake amateur camera work.  These actors simply are not in the same class as Ackles and Padalecki and watching them was, well, kind of tedious.

I am voting this episode down because I would like to discourage the producers from ever wasting another episode. This episode could easily have been part of some failed series.  Not an episode in the 8th season of a hit like Supernatural.  Please, producers, never do another episode with so little Sam and Dean in it.

If I had known that the time was mostly taken up with no-name actors, plodding through an undistinguished script, with so little of Sam and Dean, I would have skipped it completely.",1351814400,6,854,4.435897435897436

This is a mass market production for a young audience - while at the same time - it is the most successful, longest-running series in the horror / adventure genre in modern television.  I find it consistent and compelling through its Monster of the Week (MOTW) and over-arching, season-wide, big-bad.  Almost every episode will give me a ""jump"" or a decent ""yuk!"".  Supernatural is probably most successful at bridging the audiences of Buffy and Charmed, and making contact with the new age of Vampire Diaries and Twilight.  Do not overlook the influence of ""Mc G""!  He keeps the episodes fresh, contemporary and makes the soundtrack as influential as a main character... perhaps best described as simply adding ""character.""  He will spend money on the rights for the PERFECT song, and it shows!

Though never a slam-dunk ratings champ, Supernatural always performed well and earned its place in the lineup every single season.  That should tell you that you may want to get involved.  This is the last season - probably for the best - but the reruns are everywhere and the DVDs are very well produced.

5350679,3,B009LDCXNY,"Supernatural Season 8 is not starting out well for me. I disliked the premiere 8.01 - Jeremy Carver seems to be totally out of touch with most Sam Fans desires to have the character presented in both a sympathetic light and heroic light; I will never support JC's decision to have Sam not look for Dean and not even try to rescue Kevin. Even if fans find out there's more to Sam's storyline than Amelia and organic produce during Sam's year off, when if ever is it going to emerge - in episode  8.20 ??? and by then will fans even care? (The more major issue is why would Sam feel the need to be secretative if he did try and fail to find Dean and rescue Kevin.)

I only loved 8.02 so far, although the premiere did have a few good moments (music, Dean's appearance, Benny - I like ""shady characters""). I gave 8.03 Heartache 3 stars.

I loathed 8.04 ""Bitten"" - I dislike the shaky cam/found footage genre with a passion and the story line was like a very bad episode of ""Teen Wolf"" meets ""The Vampire Diaries"". I rated ""Bitten"" (on forums) 1 star (Awful). The only reason I bothered watching ""Bitten"" was because I liked all three of writer Robbie Thompson's  Season 7 episodes. I knew before it aired that 8.04 would be ""Chronicle - like"" and Winchester lite.

For the first time since Supernatural started - I've been watching since the show's debut in 2005 - I'm considering bailing on the show if I don't see Sam taking a more active role and evidence - soon - that Sam is keeping secrets of his own from Dean that don't involve Amelia but do involve hunting of a sort.",1351555200,,1573,4.354948805460751
5350680,3,B009LDCXNY,"I gave Supernatural 8.03 Heartache only three/five stars because Dean was again raking Sam over the coals for not hunting and saving people (and not caring) during his ""year off"" which is exactly what Dean did (or didn't do) during his year with Lisa and Ben.

I also wasn't overly fond of the MOTWs, except the ""babbling"" police guy inmate who felt so guilty that he put his ""donated eye"" out was quite good as was Sam's contacting the prof from Season 7's ""The Slice Girls"" for help on the case along with Dean's enthusiam in using his ""translation ap"" for the first time. I thought the actress who played Randa (who received ""Brick's heart"") was over the top and just one of the few bad actors/actresses the show has used.

One of the good parts was the end scenes (Sam and Amelia) as well as Sam's little smile at the memory but there was far too little - if the show wants to give a valid reason for Sam to give his heart to Amelia they have to show more than 15-30 second soundbites of their life. Of course if Supernatural does that it runs the risk of being too soapy as was my (and a lot of fans) criticisms of ""Dean's year off"".

There wasn't much artificially constructed tension between Sam and Dean as there was (to me) in the S8 premiere, the Purgatory flashbacks were well done (although I'm NOT Cas fan) and there were a few intriguing moments that Sam did (quick reverse exorcism) and a possible increased antagonism between Sam and Crowley that might show evidence of more contact between them than Sam is admitting to Dean at the moment.

Even though Sam and Dean were not completely in step regarding Kevin and his mother, their conversations felt more natural and in character. I just hope the Sam incidents in 8.02 were not ""red herrings"" and there is more to Sam's storyline than just hitting a dog, getting the girl and having picnics.",1351555200,,810,4.869565217391305

5350712,4,B009LDCXNY,"I've never actually written a review for anything before. After watching this episode then reading all the mostly lousy reviews for it I was compelled to write my own.

Most of the bad reviews are because Sam & Dean do not play heavily in this episode. And I get it. I get why people don't like that. But I don't agree with them. Supernatural is in its 8th season and I think the show has earned the right to be a little creative and do something a bit different than the norm. Yes, what makes Supernatural great is the Winchesters and I wouldn't want to have them as ""secondary"" characters all the time. But having an episode like this one was a nice departure for them (and even could set up a later episode or two by bringing Kate back if she ""falls off the wagon"", so to speak). Also, it was nice to see Dean agree that she didn't need to be hunted down and killed because she was now a ""monster"". (Especially, since he formerly betrayed Sam over this same issue when he killed Sam's childhood girlfriend for being a monster). That gave Dean a nice moment to contrast with the new ""warrior"" Dean that came back from purgatory.

All I'm saying is that after 8 seasons, all of which in my humblest opinion have been good solid stories, the creative minds behind Supernatural should be handed some slack. They've pretty much given fans what they've wanted out of this show and they should be able to pursue some creative license every now and again. I personally think the episode was solid and interesting. Don't let the bad reviews deter you from watching it and take it for what it is: one episode in a show that tells the story of the Winchesters and their hunts. In that respect, it does what it sets out to do. And I think it does it in a clever and creative way.",1351123200,,1770,4.3444108761329305

Supernatural at its best is a daring show, pushing its characters beyond their and the fandom's comfort zones to tell exciting tales with wit, charm, and AWESOME flair. Throughout history creative minds have found new ways to dress up the same basic ideas -- the animal portion of humanity gone wild, for example -- and this particular episode succeeded in so many ways while including the cheeky cultural references we've all come to love: Hyper self-examination/Blair Witch Trial trope, An American Werewolf in <Location>, (skewering) Lord of the Flies, et cetera. I thought the revelation at the end to be poignant considering everything that's happened in the show's past seven years.

5350736,5,B009LDCXNY,"If the series and the season of Supernatural stays as strong as the first two episodes than viewers are in for a treat. Last week Supernatural put its pieces on the board with Dean returning from Purgatory, Cas missing and unaccounted for, Sam deserting a relationship in much the same way he deserted his responsibilities and Kevin, much stronger and more competent but angered and grieved at the murder of his girlfriend at the hands of Crowley, who is seeking to regain the new prophecy tablet that details how to close the gates of hell forever.

Sam, Dean and Keving need to recover the tablet too and set off to do so after a brief detour to find Kevin's mother and put her someplace safe. But both Keven and Kevin's mother have other ideas and this leads the entire group to a very strange auction of magical artifacts. This auction is a great set-piece and has some Easter eggs in it from other favorites of the fantastic including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

I won't give any more details of a wonderful episode except to say that we end with more complications than we started with but in a believeable and organic way. The viewer is also treated to more flashbacks of Dean's time in Purgatory, a storyline that is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ever, especially in light of the fact that we saw only the results of Dean's trip to hell. Highly recommended and I am more excited for a season of SPN than I have been since the apocalypse was coming. Highly recommended.

As a final aside there is a great joke about Pluto being the God of Greed - a comment on the word plutocrat that has been so much a part of our political scene lately.",1350086400,,1687,4.435483870967742
