2433234,5,B000BOH98G,"What is arguably the best season of the x-files seasons 2 is here on dvd.  Classic episodes that uravel the mythology of the show as well as some great one shots as well.  Who can forget classics like Duane Barry, Blood, 3, The Calusari, End game, Soft light the lists goes on.  This is the season where the X became completley legitimate and a downright phenomenon if you missed it this is the season where the world started watching.  The writing by all of the X-files teams is especially strong in this season as are the production values and you can feel the actors starting to really groove on their roles.  What more can I say if you have seen these before you know you want to watch them again, if you missed them here is your perfect chance to watch them for the first time with all sorts of dvd extras.  Now where is that lone gunmen spinoff series or are we stuck with Dogget for another season?",975369600,2,905,4.325443786982248
2433235,5,B000BOH98G,"The whole series of the X-Files is great, and second season is one of the best. You HAVE to watch this season. The X-Files continue with more unexplainable phenomena and difficult cases for Mulder & Scully. Deep Throat(who was killed in the last episode of the 1st season)is replaced by X,Scully gets abducted and all the episodes are definitely going to keep you in front of your screen.",975369600,9,388,4.720588235294118
2433236,4,B000BOH98G,"I have been a long time X-Files fan, and this DVD is a fantastic addition (and replacement!) to the many VHS tapes of recorded episode that crowd my VCR cabinet.
The chapters are nicely organized, and the descriptions of each are accurate.
Overall, a great DVD! (No extra languages, but it's not a movie, so not a big deal...)",975196800,,326,4.5423728813559325
2433237,1,B000BOH98G,"What I said: I can't believe it. The first complete season was published with Spanish subtitles (and I bought that pack because of I speak Spanish) but now they have produced the second season only in English !!! THIS IS NOT COHERENT.
I don't know what's happening with the DVD editors. They often make DVD boxes with not the same language. This is a common trouble.
The first pack was very nice and I'm sure that the second pack is nice too, but it's only for English speakers. What a pity.",974937600,13,491,4.406593406593407
2433238,3,B000BOH98G,"I found season 2 ultimately disappointing.  The first season on the XFiles was filled with exciting and new stories many of which were loosly based on  actual unexplained incidents or phenomena.  The second season went a little  off the rails in this sense, not seeing the need to flesh out it's main  characters further, and I guess not helped by Gillian Andersens pregnancy  which made her absent from episodes and less prone to leaping about in  action sequences!  Nonetheless it does have a few redeeming episodes, and  any X-phile who has the first season on DVD knows this second season can  only be something very special to keep for future viewing.  You finally  have a good reason to tape over those episodes you recorded to keep off the  TV!",964656000,10,751,4.728682170542636
2433239,5,B000BOH98G,"It's difficult to say why The X-Files continues to capture the awe of the viewer.  The first season introduced us to Agents Mulder and Scully, who connected with each other movingly in the first season, and we see how that  effects them in the second as they continue to work together.
  The  second season stretches the mythology angle somewhat, but some of the  stand-alones rank among the best.
  Here's just a rundown on the best  episodes (though all of them are definitely worth seeing).
---Duane  Barry/Ascension/One Breath: The X-Files trilogy that abducted Scully!  Now,  we all know that Scully comes back, but these three shows held for me an  intense fascination with the fate/free will ideas, and certainly engaged  it's viewers in passionate discussions.---Firewalker: I don't know why I  love this episode.  I think that the seemless mesh of science, fiction, and  suspense is what enthralled me throughout.---Irresistable: In introducing  us to Donnie Pfaster, Chris Carter introduced us to one of the most evil  villains in the show's history (not the coolest, mind you).  I'd thought  that the second season had peaked with this episode, but along  came---Colony/End Game: The episode that showed us Mulder's abducted  sister!  (or a clone, or an alien-human hybrid).  Scully gets taken by the  bionic killer people (my friends claim this is why that I'm not an X-phile,  having no clue what they're called. Oh well).  Not as good as many other  mythology episodes, but still notable for Mulder's attachment to his  partner.---Dod Kalm: My favourite of season 2.  No way to truly describe  it, but it was enchanting and magical, thrilling and inspiring, a  combination of technical brilliance and artistic majesty.  Gillian Anderson  deserved an Emmy for this and Irresistable.---Anasazi: Ending with what was  the best Mythology episode to date, I'd be a fool to tell you what  happened.",959731200,78,1906,5.131147540983607
2433240,5,B000BOH98G,"Well, over here in the UK, Season One on DVD is not avalible, so my delight at the ease to get hold of it from the fabulous US of A was exponential.  The excellent episodes from season one brought back good  memories of how amusing they were.  Good sound and visual quality and a  nice presentation box will make the discs something to treasure.  With  'Ice' as one of my all times fav's, I can watch it again and again.  Only  downside is that I am unable to access the game.  We love you David,  Gillian and everyone else for the unique and unmistakeable X Files.  A  definate buy for any fan, if you can afford them.  Can't wait for season  two, then the rest!",959731200,12,663,4.2
2433241,5,B000BOH98G,"Well, the first DVD set of the X-Files introduced us to Mulder and Scully, Cancer Man, Deep Throat and Skinner.  It showed us various monsters and serial killers, and started the great mythology we know today in episodes  like ""Pilot"" and ""The Erlenmeyer Flash"".  Now, we've  got the second season coming out!  The mythology gets better in episodes  like ""Ascension"", ""One Breath"" and ""Anasazi"",  plus we get are first look at characters like Krychek, X, and Mulder's  family.  Relive some of the great moments of the second season, buy this  DVD!",958780800,16,547,4.912087912087912
2433242,5,B000BOH98G,"Whoopee!  Glad they're coming out with Season 2 later this year.  That means I have roughly 6 months to save for this set!
As one may gather, I'm obviously an x-phile - how else can one explain a five-star rating for  a dvd boxed set which isn't even available yet? Heck, I'm still waiting for  my Season 1 gift set order from amazon to arrive.
Here's a rundown of  the second season episodes:
1) Takes off from the season one finale.  After the X-Files have been shut down, Mulder & Scully journey to  Puerto Rico. 2) Introduces fan-favorite The Flukeman, a genetic mutation  living in the New Jersey sewer system.  3) Residents in a small community  suddenly become violent, apparently urged on by digital readouts ordering  them to kill.  4) Introduces Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). 5) Mulder is in  the middle of a hostage negotiation involving alien-abductee Duane Barry.  6) Continues from the previous; Mulder pursues Barry who has kidnapped  Scully. 7) My personal favorite! Vampire-themed episode featuring  Duchovny's then  real-life girlfriend Perrey Reeves. 8) Scully is found,  albeit in a coma. 9) Deadly lifeform living in a volcano. 10) Agents  investigate a possible connection between several teenager disappearances  and a religious cult. 11) Strange unseen attacks in a nursing home. 12) The  personality of a serial killer is transferred to his granddaughter 13) An  ""escalating fetishist"" episode, where one's relatively harmless  ""hobby"" turns homicidal. 14) Satan worshippers pay for their  laxity! 15) Voodoo episode. 16) Features horror genre fan-fave Brian  Thompson (Fright Night, Kindred) as the alien boutny hunter. Mulder meets  long-lost sister Samantha (or does he?). 17) Continues from previous. 18)  Animal abductions from a zoo near a major UFO hotspot. 19) Partly inspired  by ""The Philadelphia Experiment"". 20) Great episode featuring  circus acts, Jim Rose, and the Conundrum! 21) Possession story featuring  the Romanian holymen the Calusari. 22) Plague-like epidemic sweeps a prison  facility.  23) Killer shadows.  For Marvel comics fans this recalls powers  of characters such as Cloak and The Shroud.  24) A town hides a terrible  secret.  Hint - read up on the New Guinea Jale tribe.  25) Cliffhanger  episode.  Hacker obtains all the Defense Department's files on UFO's -  encrypted in Navajo!
NO BRAINER - Get this set of one of the most  fascinating sci-fi TV series of all time!",958694400,213,2425,5.176165803108808

2433279,5,B000BOH98G,"Content: FIVE STARS, Disc Case/Menus: FOUR STARS.
I'm a huge X Files fan and the first season is my go-to whenever I'm bored. Season two is great and still has that eerie feeling that the later seasons (and the revival) lacked. Season 2 starts out a little odd because Gillian Anderson was pregnant; directors were trying to hide her from the chest down which means that most of the scenes with her in it, she's standing behind a filing cabinet or poking her head around a corner. Episode 9 marked the first time she was back after having her daughter and her scenes go back to normal. I'm not a big fan of the early episodes in this season mostly because it lacked a lot of Scully's presence, but it's still completely worth watching. The later episodes are better, with ""Dd Kalm"" ranking the best.

They touch on a lot of heavy topics during season two: sex, rape, assault and abduction, cults, and the death of a young child. It's typical subjects for the X Files--but it's something viewers may want to know ahead of time.

I'm not sure what some of the negative reviewers mean when they said their discs didn't include the final episode, ""Anasazi."" My disc set has all the episodes in the order they should they watched. I dislike two things about the blu-ray set: Season two is thicker than all the other seasons, so if you're displaying them on a shelf, it looks odd and out of place. And the disc menu is horribly set up; the screen and text are dark and it's difficult knowing what feature is selected. Then, when you click on the episode you want to watch, you then have to scroll down and hit ""play episode only"" or it plays all four episodes even through you've selected one specific episode. The DVD menus were much better laid out and easier to navigate.",1475539200,4,1768,4.487577639751553

The ability for a group of well-meaning individuals to ""shock us with the truth"" is long past, in this era in which a certifiable madman is a few votes away from occupying the White House, an era in which mind-boggling atrocities and undeniable scandals that betray the public trust - is media-fed to  us in the same breath as Kardashian updates.

The first 4 seasons were filmed in 4:3 format, meaning that there would be black bands on the left and right of the screen.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars is it has the same ""ghost in the machine"" glitch that my Season 1 had. It cant' play one single episode alone - or just select one episode from the menu. How do you get these things to play a single episode?  I put on in - hit the play by episode menu and it  jumps to ""play all episodes"" - always. Can't select a single episode by itself. I can't even see the last 2 episodes of Season 1 on these new blue-rays because the menu is all weird. Maybe Mulder would know what's wrong?

2433733,5,B000BOH98G,"If Your reading this then you have been hooked on this series for over two decades. From season TWO there are two episodes that always stand out in my mind.
Fearful Symmetry
I liked this episode because there is a smashed Gremlin AMC compact car. You can even see it in the thumbnail on Amazon. I just imagine two guys like Wayne and Garth from Wayne's World comming out and being devistated that thier Gremlin has been trashed by a circus animal accident. The choice of the car in the scene is a subliminal of the X-Files. Only agents Skully and Moulder would be investigating the circus freaks with a real serious notion of solving the murders.

The very next Episode that is totally awesome is Dod Kalm. A ship is stranded in an arctic bermuta triangle. It turns out that a meteor has turned that section of the sea in to a giant ION Battery that causes you to age rapidly and die. The premise is on a solid theory of radical ion batteries. The condition causes the ship to corrode rapidly as if time is accelerating. Moulder and Skully transform before your eyes and they make up is quite good. When Skully looks for life saving fluids she finds a snow globe and sardine juice. You can see real disgust on Moulders face when she offers it to him as the life giving soultion. Great acting in this episode.

One of the solutions that I thought of while watching this episode was to suspend yourself in a cargo net using a bungee cord. This would isolate you from the electron ionic forces that cause the concentration of salts in the aging body. I also like it when the captain of the boat locks himself in the grey water room to hog the life saving watre for himself. The hull corrodes and he can not get out because the door is rusted shut. Karma then drowns him in the room. This is a one of the best episodes.

FYI: DARPA has experimented with such ion batteries. It can cause things to age faster and in reveres form can stop aging process. You can find more about it at DARPA.gov if you do a deep search.

2433734,5,B000BOH98G,"I loved and still love all the episodes in the X-Files series! Not one i didn't like!

Bought from Best Buy.

The X-Files in 16:9 high definition Blu ray! Been a huge fan since season 1 and i finally get to re live these massive TV moments in awesome detail and quality!

Being a believer of the paranormal and government conspiracies i instantly got turned on to this excellent show!

In most episodes, Mulder and Scully investigate paranormal happenings that defy the laws of nature or the universe. Scully proves to be ever the skeptic she set out to be, never being convinced of Mulder's work.

Should you pick this up if you are a fan? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Positively!

2433737,5,B000BOH98G,"Chris Carter and his writing staff pushed forward and produced a marvelous set of episodes that set the stage for later seasons opening up the alien conspiracy story and--truly-- search for Mulder's sister begins to occupy center stage with a key episode here and the introduction of the alien bounty Hunter

The truth is on this Blu-ray. I wanted to believe that this was going to be a terrific transfer and, largely, it is. The second season improves  on the first with no sophomore slump evident. As with season one the direction (most notably Rob Bowman, David Manners and Kim Manners) is top notch but even n that area the second season takes a quantum leap.

The first season of ""The X-Files"" borrowed from a variety of great sources--the first season of ""Twin Peaks"", the movie ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" even some of the moody TV series being shot in the UK. What made the series unique was how well it mixed and matched these elements but, more importantly, the chemistry between the leads in the series.

With the second season the series had found its voice. There are plenty of stand alone episodes here but the mythology episodes further that element in some taunt, suspenseful mini-movies with very nice production value. The absence of Scully (Gillian Anderson) due to her pregnancy created an opportunity for the writers to expand the cast of characters making Assistant Director Skinner semi-regular ( Mitch Pelliggi)

The transfer is nearly flawless with a nice, detailed, film-like quality to the transfer with very few detectable visual flaws. These have been painstakingly re-scanned in 2K from the original negatives with the exception of the stock footage and visual effects created in SD on videotape were upscaled from SD wherethere are no camera negatives to work with and due to cost while some visual effects have been recomposited for new HD transfers.

There are some episodes where they had to upscale a handful shots (not the stock footage) in episodes like the second half of the Duane Barry two parter (at least four close ups where they couldn't locate footage) but, on the whole,,the fact that they were able to find almost all'of,the shots for the series is impressive.

Disc seven is also flawed (not necessarily in a bad way) as it includes the last episode of disc six ""Soft Light"" at the beginning of disc seven.

The downside for many fans will be that the first four seasons have had the image changed from full screen to widescreen in HD. How was this done? There's a portion of the frame referred to as the ""safety area""--this area at the side edges of the image that wasn't intended to be seen. Usually that's because you can see lighting rigs, the edge to the sets, etc. Luckily for ""The X-Files"" (unlike ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" by comparison) that wasn't the case and it allows for expansion of the image . I will say that the head room IS a bit tight compared to before (they have to crop a bit from the top and bottom to expand it to fill the screen) at times but, over all, its a pretty good job of re-framing the original image. It would have been nice if they had taken the time to include those as an option as well for fans but the new scans are such a remarkable upgrade, I can forgive them for not including that as an option.

The moody photography finally gets its due on home video. Detail is remarkable and this is very much comparable to the ""Twin Peaks"" blu-ray release the difference, though, is that ""Twin Peaks"" features brighter colors simply by virtue of the fact that was how Lynch wanted it vs. Chris Carter who wanted a more muted tone to the show. The colors look terrific.

The 5.1 remix sounds very nice and, even when listened in stereo, the dialog is largely clean and clear without the muddled quality of many shows from the same time frame.

The audio 2.0 tracks are available in English, German, French and Spanish as are the subtitles.

All of the special features from the DVDs have been carried over to this set. We also get the commentary tracks that came with the original sets as well (although it would have been nice to get more) which is a nice touch.

There's no booklet but Fox has provided us with an episode guy printed on the flip side of the cover art (which, while interesting, looks a little too photoshopped for my taste but it's not a make or break deal any more than the menu for the series being pretty straight forward. A couple of reviews have noted the lack of imagination but, honestly, I could care less about what the menu looks like particularly if it consumes bit space at the expense of the visuals.

As of this writing, the individual sets are cheaper than the boxed set and, beyond the fact that there is a slot for the 2016 mini-series, there's really no reason to pick up the boxed set unless you want something big to store them in as there's nothing special IN the set by itself.

Should you pick this up if you are a fan? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Positively!",1449964800,6,4986,4.580246913580247
2433738,5,B000BOH98G,"""The X-Files"" is a science fiction horror drama that ran for nine seasons from 1993-2002. The two principle characters are Fox Mulder(David Duchovny) and Dana Scully(Gillian Anderson) who are FBI agents who specialize in investigating paranormal phenomena.
The blu-ray of season 2 looks great and appears to have been remastered and cleaned up. The blu-ray is also in anamorphic widescreen. I checked one frame of the episode of ""Ascension"" just to see how the image looked on the blu-ray in comparison to the DVD, and there is much more image on both sides such that it now fills the screen. So there is actually more of the original image showing from the original master negative, as opposed to the image simply being stretched to fill the screen. There was also a bit more on the top, but a bit less on the bottom of the image of the blu-ray compared to the DVD's full frame image (which showed black bars on the sides of a flat screen TV). The sound is also in 5.1 HD Master Audio surround sound as opposed to 2.0 on the DVDs. Some of the images occasionally appear to have been shot in a lower resolution, or are slightly out of focus, so they look a bit grainy, though in most cases the images look pristine in 1080p with much more clarity overall. And it appears that most of the special features from the Collector's Edition sets have been included. All in all these episodes look great and fresh.",1449619200,5,1406,4.561264822134388

It has aged surprisingly well given its emphasis on things like current culture and technology, meaning that my second watch has been more enjoyable than I expected.

The creators have went on to do other great shows like Breaking Bad.  Many of the actors that do guest appearances on the X-files end up getting bigger parts in future classics.  If you haven't watched the X-Files from start to finish, including the movies, you are missing out on some great great entertainment.

Specifically, Season 2 starts slow and then builds to a great finale that will have you going straight to Season 3 to see what happens.  It's a great binge.  It contains come great one off episodes along with continuing the main plot.",1438992000,,719,4.5625

2434048,5,B000BOH98G,"If you are just now getting involved in this great TV series, Season 2 is captivating in many episodes, especially the bookends. In fact, Anasazi and the two leading episodes of Season 3 are some of the best episodes in this long-running series. If you pay attention to Anasazi and everything mentioned in it and then the first episode of Season 3, you will discover some semblance of truth in the series and how they handle the Navajo heritage and a (possible) link to the main mytharc of the X-Files.

This series is captivating and I have seen it many times. It never gets old or boring. I have come to enjoy certain episodes over others and Anasazi is one of those.

While the ""monster of the week"" is always handled very well by Chris Carter and his wonderful production teams in both Vancouver and LA, the main story line of aliens and Mulder's quest (with Scully joining in) of searching for the truth is what fans of this seminal series look for in each episode. In fact, there is usually a hint of the main story line in each episode and with some that information is important to the quest of the characters and the audience as we join them on their search. So, watch each episode carefully and enjoy your journey.",1424649600,,1224,4.484304932735426

2434067,5,B000BOH98G,"Season 2 of The X Files was much better than Season 1.  How could that be?  By the end of Season 1 the characters had settled into their roles, the directors, producers, writers, at al had a feel for what they could sell to the public and what would be watchable television.

The X Files seldom let anyone down.  Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) slow swing to Agent Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) side added a degree of harmony to the program instead of ""When is she going to sell him out?"".  The story writing got better and better.  Things that went bump in the night began bumping in the daytime.  The X Files took over where Outer Limits and Twilight Zone left off.

By Season Two, Duchovny and Anderson had established a rhythm to their dialog and work.  Without knowing, each knew.  Without seeing, each saw.  They operated well together.",1421193600,,847,4.58

2434139,5,B000BOH98G,Excellent  writing. Themes explored on topics that range from the extra-terrestrial to paranormal. Some hit close to home and where our imaginations want desperately to go. The acting is natural with a relationship between Fox and Dana that goes far deeper than just friends and surely beyond a working relationship. To leave either out of an episode cuts the attraction in half. A cultural classic for certain.,1408579200,,411,5.134328358208955

The acting is still passable, slightly contrived as almost always seems to happen with old shows that are this iconic.

The ""special effects"" are magical. Because CGI was so limited, they did a ton of the effects with camera tricks, props and lights. A perfect example of how less can be more.

My favorite part is how the science fiction is really just a conduit for a running expos on a government/corporate conspiracy. All of the characters have their own humanity and motivations, and Mulder and Scully are open about those things, rarely truly villainizing another human being.

I highly recommend this to critical thinkers and sci-fi lovers!",1406937600,,684,4.870689655172414

I am thoroughly re-addicted to The Adventures of Scully (and that other dude). Though I can't help pointing out what I'm sure gazillions of others have: Scully has thus far seen (like, SEEN, man. Been in the middle of, yo!) so many paranormal things/people/events--pyrokinetics, telekinetics, poltergeists, she's been abducted by aliens, SEEN living, breathing aliens, fat-eating mutants, liver-eating mutants, prehistoric killer moths, and shadows that incinerate people...and yet with every case remains a hard-core skeptic. I love/hate the fact that I am to believe that someone as smart as she (clearly the finest agent in the history of the FBI) wouldn't at some point, sooner rather than later, have thrown up her hands and just finally decided to believe in life, the universe, and everything.

There were no DVR's and recording meant finding a tape with room on it, labeling and most horrid of all....figuring out how to set up your time and stuff on the VCR.  The show is a little creature of the week with some good relationship arcs.  I like the new players they have introduced in this one but I am not enjoying the 21 jump street music that plays the whole time I am watching it.  (not everyone will get this )  I think the boldest move for this show has been that they did not pump it full of pretty people so it really has to rely on good story telling.  If you like a little spooky mixed with mystery mixed with crime drama you will love this show.",1399334400,,707,4.0503597122302155

2434218,5,B000BOH98G,"X-Files is IMHO one of the best TV Epics to ever have been made.
AND unlike so many other shows that required thinking this one lasted ... maybe too long!
Regarding this set.
I picked up Season one in this releases 'format' and liked it. When I wanted to buy season two I discovered there is a 'thin-pack' version. From what I can gleen from other reviews and looking at the sealed cases in stores this 7 disc set is the better of the two.
I have read that the 'thin-pack'  is wide screen ... I can not verify that.  I may pick up from a local vendor Season 3 in the  'thin-pack'  format (as the price is very low) just to see if that is true.  I have to admit I would prefer the widescreen version.
4:3 to wide gives that 'fat face' syndrome.",1397606400,,743,4.096551724137931

2434222,4,B000BOH98G,"I am a huge FRINGE fan in mourning for this wonderful show, that I feel was the best show of its kind, ever!  I had never seen the X-Files and after watching the first season began to like it. I am now about half way into the 2nd season and am really enjoying the show. I like the relationship developing between the two main characters,  Skully and Mulder (not sure of the spelling). I think that this 2nd season is better than the first, with more continuity from one episode to the next, and more information regarding the back stories of the characters. I would recommend the show to anyone who enjoys fringe science and thinks outside the box. I don't think that it measures up to FRINGE,  or Lost,  at least not yet. But I am enjoying watching it,  especially without commercials, and the ability to watch more than one episode at a time via Netflix . or Amazon Prime.",1396396800,,874,4.403726708074534

2434306,5,B000BOH98G,"While some aspects may be dated, the fundamentals of The X-Files still hold true.  With its ongoing penchant for conspiracy theories and healthy distrust of social and governmental institutions, it proved to be one of the most influential, iconic series of the 90's, and its perfect blend of mystery, humor, horror, and the mildly macabre guarantee good entertainment for the money.  Despite the occasional loose end that never quite gets tied up, I heartily recommend Seasons 1-6 without reservation.

Like I find so called ""reality shows""...there is a lot of frightening stuff going on in that stuff for certain, not for everyone. I feel the writing was very well done for most of the series episodes and it was filmed with skill and great direction.

2434324,5,B000BOH98G,"Season 2 of X-Files is even better than the first season.  Here's a review of each episode, with synopsizes from the box.

25.  Little Green Men:  Mulder races to make physical contact with a downed UFO before a secret government team can cover it up.  A near=perfect start to the season.  A

26.  The Host:  Mulder and Scully pursue the Flukeman, a murderous genetic mutant lurking in the New Jersey sewer system.  One of the scariest episodes.  A+

27.  Blood:  While investigating a series of small-town murders, the agents discover everyday appliances are being used as instruments of death.  A creepy and interesting episode.  A+

28.  Sleepless:  Mulder and his new partner, Alex Krycek, face a sleep-deprived marine who may possess the ability to kill with his dreams.  Another interesting one.  A+

29.  Duane Barry:  While negotiating a tense hostage situation, Mulder finds himself sympathizing with a gunman who claims to be the victim of alien abduction.  The beginning of my favorite myth arc episodes this season.  A+

30.  Ascension:  When Scully is abducted by unseen forces, Mulder launches a desperate search to find her, only to be thwarted by a stunning betrayal.  Another excellent episode.  A+

31.  3:  While probing a series of ritualistic murders, Mulder becomes involved with a beautiful suspect who may be a vampire.  A good episode with some creative ideas, but it lags toward the end.  B+

32.  One Breath:  As a comatose Scully fights for her life, Mulder uncovers clues to her abduction, leading to a confrontation with the Cigarette-Smoking Man.  My favorite episode of this season.  A+

33.  Firewalker:  Mulder & Scully are stalked by a deadly new life form that has invaded the bodies of a volcanic research team.  The worst episode of the season.  It's a rehash of Ice. C-

34.  Red Museum:  While investigating a rural religious cult the agents expose a sinister experiment involving violent teens and alien DNA.  A great episode, though the final confrontation could've been better.  A-

35.  Excelsis Dei:  When an experimental drug releases troubled spirits at a nursing home, Mulder and Scully face killer poltergeists.  A really creepy episode.  A

36.  Aubrey:  The agents help a pregnant woman being stalked by a serial killer who appears to have inherited deadly genetic memories.  Very creepy at times, but the ending left a little to be desired.  A-

37.  Irresistible:  With Scully's life hanging in the balance, Mulder pursues a death fetishist whose horrifying obsessions could lead to murder.  Pretty good.  B+

38.  Die Hand Die Verletzt:  Mulder and Scully face the prospect of becoming human sacrifices when they uncover a Satan-worshipping cult led by a demonic substitute teacher.  The ending was a bit of a cop-out for me, but the rest of it was excellent.  A

39.  Fresh Bones:  While investigating deaths at a Haitian refugee camp, the agents meet up with a vengeful voodoo priest who may possess the ability to raise the dead.  A great, creepy episode.  A

40.  Colony:  During the murder investigation of three identical doctors, Mulder makes a stunning discovery regarding his missing sister, and Scully's life is threatened by a shape-shifting bounty hunter.  This episode is interesting for the most part.  A-

41.  End Game:  While tracking the ruthless bounty hunter who has abducted Scully, Mulder uncovers an alien plan to colonize Earth.  A disappointing conclusion.  This could've been a lot better.  B-

42.  Fearful Symmetry:  Rare zoo animals are being abducted and impregnated in a case Mulder believes may be linked to an alien conspiracy.  Another great episode.  A

43.  Dod Kalm: Stranded on a ""ghost ship,"" Mulder and Scully must unravel the mystery of an unearthly force that is causing them to age at an accelerated rate.  A

44.  Humbug:  The agents enter the bizarre world of sideshow performers when an unseen creature begins killing the inhabitants of a circus town.  This is not just one of the scariest episodes, but also the funniest I've seen so far.  A+

45.  The Calusari:  Mulder & Scully are exposed to the ancient ritual of exorcism while investigating a young boy possessed by evil.  It felt a bit too much like the Excorcist & the Omen at times, but it was still above average.  A-

46.  F. Emasculata:  The agents go behind bars to stop a horribly disfiguring virus that is killing prison inmates at an epidemic rate.  Pretty intense.  B+

47.  Soft Light:  Mulder and Scully pursue an unbalanced scientist whose research has caused his shadow to become deadly.  Again, not my favorite but it was pretty good.  B+

48.  Our Town:  While probing murders in a Southern town, the agents find evidence of modern-day cannibalism and its links to eternal life.  A near perfect episode.  A

49.  Aanasazi:  Mulder and Scully discover a chilling link between a UFO cover-up and secret government experiments.  An excellent end to the season.  A+

Great season overall.  One complaint though, is it just me or did Scully get captured a lot?  It got annoying & ruined otherwise perfect episodes like Our Town for me.  Still a great season.",1369008000,,5126,4.907801418439717

2434339,4,B000BOH98G,"The show is good.  I didn't watch it when it was new, only saw it in reruns.  It's nice to see it all in proper order for once.

As for the show itself, the only complaint I have is the generally slow pace of the episodes.  The mythology (the government knows everything, shares nothing, and kills indiscriminately to protect that knowledge) is fun to follow, and the show's monster-of-the-week nature (worm-man, vampires, killer bacteria and parasites) is interesting, comparing the effects of the time with what's on tv now.  The second season sees the relationship between Scully and Mulder continuing to change from one of requisite disbelief (given Scully's original assignment to debunk Mulder's work, season 1) to one of professional - and, by the end of the season, personal - support in the face of inherent disbelief (given Scully's basic scientific nature as a doctor).

Alien abductions,  governmental double-crosses, surprise murders, it all adds up to one of the most intriguing television series I've ever seen.

However...

I know this is more of a seller review, but I want people here to read this also.  I paid for a new DVD set, and received a used one.  When I opened the Amazon box, the plastic wrap around the set was split at the seam.  No big deal.  I worked a long time in retail and I know that a split seam doesn't mean used.  Also, the box itself looks ... aged.  There are small marks on the box, little white scuffs on the folds, as if it had been opened and closed a few times already, tiny indentations, as if the set had been moved around a lot, maybe slid across a table ...  I chalked all of that up to shipping.  Maybe the seller had this particular set in his warehouse or whatever for a while and it had been moved all around, maybe banged up a bit here and there.  No problem, I said to myself.  But, as I was watching the show and switching from disc to disc it was clearly evident that these dvds had been removed from their cradles before.  The information side of every disc was dirty.  Not anything as obvious as fingerprints, but there was a degree of dust and particles on the face of every disc that just isn't present in new items.  PLUS, the little episode booklet wasn't included.  Just an empty pocket where a little episode booklet would fit so nicely ...

So, the four stars is for the show.  The seller review is for your own edification.",1366243200,,2393,4.522144522144522

There was one season 2 episode which was pretty corny with a lot of one-liners, the one about the ""freaks in Florida"", but a little comic relief here and there is good, too.

2434368,5,B000BOH98G,"Back in the nineties when the X Files aired, I was young and busy working, getting an education, raising children and struggling to pay for all of the above. My time in front of the television set was limited to say the least, but sci-fi and fantastic fiction lover that I am, even I managed to catch some episodes of the X-Files and loved the characters and the mythology. I especially liked it that not every case ended up having supernatural causes. It kept the show balanced and kept the tension between the beliefs of the two main characters, Mulder and Scully, alive and believable.

I decided to do a re-watch of all of the seasons as I never got the story in its entirety. I am thrilled that I have decided to do this and surprised at just how dark a vision the X-Files is. Many of the episodes are disturbing whether the explanation is supernatural or not and a lot of them make the viewer ponder deeper issues.

In this season alone we have a grave robber and death fetishist who isn't in the least supernatural in origin. He is just sick. This case floors even the normally phlegmatic Scully. Then there is Duane Berry, an alien abductee, or is he really just psychotic and brain-damaged and taking hostages because of that? The answer is never fully known, adding to the tension. Then there are the work a day suburbanites who are willing to keep their quiet, affluent lives as such via worship of the devil. This episode mixes causes both supernatural and venal and is brilliant because of it. What sacrifices do we make and what evil do we ignore to keep our lives comfortable? Not a question one expects to ask oneself subject to a television show, but then science fiction has always been the literature of subversion and ideas and the X-Files honors that tradition. And that describes just a few of the episodes in a stellar season of this great show.

I realize that like all long-running shows with a complex mythology that later seasons are criticized by the fan base, but part of that may be because what came before was so brilliant in its conception and execution. Definitely worth a watch or a re-watch for fans of horror, mystery and science fiction. A landmark of television in the fantastic genre. A solid A for this season.",1359849600,,2251,4.566831683168317

I ordered the episode via streaming and was able to catch all the action that I couldn't watch otherwise.  The X-Files, as everyone knows by now, has passed from television history into legend, but the idea of being able to find a new way to see an episode that I could not otherwise watch was an excellent one.  The video was as clear as if it were on an HD disc, and the sound was fine.  I prefer discs at the moment, but it is good to know that this method exists.

Armed with the knowledge that the show was going to be around for a while, everything gets expanded upon. We are introduced to some new characters and story lines that will be the mainstay for the show for seasons to come.  Right off the bat in the first few episodes it is obvious that the Cigarette Smoking man played by William B. Davis has had his role greatly increased compared to the first season. In my opinion, the episode ""One Breath"" in which Mulder confronts the Smoking man, has to be one of the best scenes in the whole series.  I thought that every filler episode that did not deal with the greater alien conspiracy was really well done too.
I would highly recommend this season. Ideally you should start with the first season and go from there.  I watched this whole season in just a few days because I was so sucked into the story.",1324944000,,937,4.404624277456647

This leads them on the trail of the bizarre and more, hoping to find something that might make up for the risk they take by putting off people that could potentially harm the X-Files.

Out of all the episodes I have seen, this has to be one of the best - and the most memorable - of all the monster files. not only does it have to do with the X-files, but it also shows just what Mulder and Skully are made of. With Mulder off doing his thing and doing it well, Skully has gotten into this place where she does double roles sometimes. This means she plays the scientist and the agent, sometimes cutting something up in the name of understanding and sometimes saving Mulder because he can't save himself.

Who said women don't earn their keep?

I really like the flukeman, too, and I like the impact it had. If you doubt how well it was recieved, simply do a search on the name and see what items pop up. It comes in behind ""i want to Believe"" as the merchadise Mecca of episodes, with it producing everything from shirts to statuettes.

2434401,5,B000BOH98G,"X-Files is the best TV show of its kind since The Twilight Zone by Rod Serling. It is the perfect marriage of paranormal and sci-fi and is a real treasure for anyone who loves mystery, suspense and UFOs. FBI has a secret division called ""The X-Files"" where two FBI agents, Mulder and Scully, are working together on resolving the cases that are paranormal in nature. Its central theme is government's conspiracy about aliens. The show plays around the idea that US government knows about aliens and conducts secret experiments which is a theme that rings bells with UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. Those episodes are known as ""myth"" episodes and they follow a certain timeline; in every season there are at least 3-4 mythological episodes. Because they follow a certain timeline, to make the best sense out of them, they need to be watched in order. But then there are those episodes that tells a story in one single epiode and they are called ""stand-alone"" episodes.

Whether you like UFOs or paranormal, you will find something you like in every season. The one of the reason for the succcess of the show in general is the chemistry between Mulder and Scully. This is not a romantic chemistry but rather a chemistry between two professional partners who are open and willing to understand each other, through which they develop a strong trust, friendship and loyalty. Scully has more scientific approach; she needs evidence and she needs proof. Mulder, on the other hand, believes in the existence of UFOs and things of paranormal nature. They represent two opposite views but this creates a perfect balance for the show.

My favorite and other memorable episodes of Season 2 are as follows:
-The Host: a monster size flukeworm ""flukeman"" that is looking for a host and inhabits a processing plant
-Duane Barry / Ascension: Back to back episodes about a man named Duane Barry who claims he is being abducted by aliens on regular basis.
-Aubrey: one of the scariest episodes of the season
-Irresistibe: one of the creepiest criminals in the series, Donnie Phaster, a guy who's obsessed with women.
-Die Hand Die Verletz: high school students' black magic ritual for summoning demonic forces cause strange things to happen. One of the scarriest and creepiest episodes.
-Colony/End Game: my favorite myth episodes of the season 2. Mulder finds her sister (maybe not), an alien craft could be lurking in the sea.
-Fearful Symmetry: Invisible zoo animals wreak havoc
-Dod Kalm: Boarding a ship out in the sea somewhere, Mulder and Scully find themselves aging rapidly
-Humbug: This is probably a fans' favorite and memorable episode of the entire series. Strange killings start to happen at a site where circus is visiting.
-F. Emasculata: This is in my top 5 favorite X-Files Episodes. Two prison inmates catch a deadly and very contagious virus without knowing and escape from prison. FBI hunt begins to capture them. They race against the time before the virus spreads to general population.
-Soft Light: Another favorite of mine from season 2. It's about a man who accidentally acquired a power that causes anyone in his shadow to melt down instantly.
-Anasazi: After Duanne Barry, Ascension, Colony and End Game, second season ends with this 5th myth episode",1295222400,,3270,4.9653284671532845

2434405,5,B000BOH98G,"X-Files 2nd season.  I like the cancer man and deep throat characters a lot.  You can tell Chris Carter grew up during the Water gate era.  Mulder and Scully continue to take on great cases.  My favorite are always the cases involving the Conspiracy.  Its funny its presented to us this way.  Deep throat tells Mulder that 'They' have been here for a very long time.  The 2nd season is a great teaser of the conspiracy could be about.  I love the introduction of such characters like Max Fenig.  The 2nd season episode shows us how the decency or censorship rules on fox were pushed too.  People wondered if Gillian Anderson was actually eating a bug from the circus people episode.  Of course, she didn't.  Anderson is a good actress.  Its unfortunate someone won't give her a script with solid characters.  We really see her character grow in this season.  We see more of her relationship with her parents and her walking a line with Mulder on whether she thinks he's crazy or he isn't really crying wolf after all.  The 2nd season is what really hooked me to become a fan.  It was probably my favorite show from the 1990s.  If you are an X-Files fan, this DVD is a must if you want to see the series in its entirety.  If you are new or a casual watcher of the show, 2nd season sets you up for where the show is going.  2nd season also gives away a couple of big secrets to the series.  Don't forget the writers put all sorts of subtle humor into the show.  You can see a lot of in the 2nd season.

2434425,5,B000BOH98G,"The X-Files Season 2 begins with one of the best episodes of the season.  ""Little Green Men"" finally showed us the abduction of Samantha Mulder and pretty much proved that the truth is out there.  As it turns out, ""Little Green Men"" was just a taste of what was to come.

The X-Files has its ups and downs, but this season was a definete up.  Almost every episode was excellent and well-thought out.  Of course some episodes were dreadful, including the ridiculous ""Excelesis Dei"" and ""Fearful Symmetry"".

The first season just hinted at an overarcing mythology for the series, in such episodes as ""E.B.E."" and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"".  This season really gave the series direction in terms of its mythology.  After ""Little Green Men"" we had The excellent ""Duane Barry"", where an insane man who takes people in a travelling agency hostage claims to have been abducted by aliens.  The subsequent episode, ""Asension"", is a powerhouse of plot twists and important events, including Scully's abduction.  ""One Breath"" shows when Scully is returned to Mulder, but is in a deadly coma.  ""Red Museam"" answers the question who killed Deep Throat.  ""Colony"" and ""Endgame"" show the apparent return of Samantha Mulder to her family and an alien bounty hunter is going after aliens on Earth.  The season finale, ""Anasazi"" is the best episode of the season, ending with a major cliffhanger.

2434430,5,B000BOH98G,"Freaks, geeks, and smart people were nowhere to be found on Friday nights. Club floors usually packed with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a casual hook-up over liquor and loud music were thin. Comic shops, arcades and other dives haunted by the young and smart dropping out seemed like tombs. And no upwardly mobile corporate-type wanted to be out of the loop come Monday morning when everyone was discussing at the watercooler what Mulder and Scully had discovered Friday night. Everyone had been home, glued to the tube, at least for that one wonderful hour, watching Chris Carter's ""The X-Files."" It was the hipest, most intelligent show on television.

Fans who had been there from the very first episode and watched their favorite show become a media obsession were worried that the sudden glare would ruin the show. But Carter proved as immune to the powers that be as Mulder was. Fox Mulder was still on a quest to discover the truth, and Carter was still on a quest to make the most original and interesting show on television.

Picking up right where season one ended, with Duchovny's Mulder somehow lost within the conventional cases assigned him after the X-Files had been shut down, we watched with sympathy and anticipation as the separated F.B.I. Agents found ways to work together. Gillian Anderson was perfect in every way as the beautiful Dana Scully. She found ways in her performance to convey the deep attachment to Fox and his his quest to out the men in the shadows controlling and hiding the truth about alien abductions and other secrets.

With Deep Throat dead, the Agents discover they have another ""friend"" in the halls of power. Some of the show's most memorable episodes came about in season two. Cases involving both the paranormal and monstors of the man-made variety (The Host) were explored. Carter still managed to inject humor into the show at times (Humbug). It usually came through Mulder's sardonic wit or the often fact-based paranoia of The Lone Gunmen. Season two proved somewhat darker and more dangerous, however. Mulder's insatiable drive for the truth the government was hiding from the public had not gone below the radar screen of those responsible for keeping their dark secrets buried.

Season two was filled with startling revelations regarding Mulder's father and ""Smoking Man"" (Anasazi). The story arc where Scully herself was abducted and Mulder searched in desperation for her would have ramifications only discovered in following seasons. Genetic memories and voodoo, deadly shadows and alien plans to colonize Earth, ghost ships and vampires, all populated and galvanized viewers to the show each week. It may indeed have had distant relatives out there in TV land, but nothing of this scope and originality had ever been attempted before.

Through it all, it was the relationship between Mulder and Scully we found fascinating. Watching them work a case together was like watching Fred and Ginger dance. You couldn't take your eyes off the couple, even if they weren't officially a couple, and even though the dance was darker and more dangerous. Mulder and Scully have become so imbedded in the minds and hearts of fans that years later we still await Carter's new big-screen venture to discover their plight. Dramatic and funny, scary and touching, it may just have been the coolest thing ever on television.",1206316800,3,3377,5.023214285714285
2434431,5,B000BOH98G,"Being a die hard fan of x files ( ever since the series came out ) and being connected to it and the various alt.tv.xfiles newsgroups etc for a while, i thought it was great when the slim set was introduced,as personally speaking i don't care that much about what the actors think of the show or what they are doing or any bloopers etc ( i have been through that phase when i was kinda still in schooling mode ). So the slim set seemed excellent with ""so - so"" price option, i still think 30s is a bit high, i would like to see this dvd starting from 25 - 30 $ max, the justification for this is simply  because of several reasons :

( In NO order of importance in particular ) ...
1. ) its a Slim Set ( and DVD 7 is supposed to be ok )
2. ) Quality of DVDs ( the quality as seen on 24 inch flat lcd monitor ) seemed so so or decent at best.
3 .) Blu Ray or HD DVD world - Well this is connected to above point but still, with blu ray or Hi def content upon us, i doubt people would be interested on getting dvds ( for people who would want to keep the sets they would want comparable quality anyways, so it should stack up against it in some ways ... i in fact believe that it doesn't ).
4. ) X Files is somewhat been out of vogue for a while now, yea granted that there are fans like us who still order x files, but still even the re-runs on scifi are shown in 2 AM slot! so one can imagine that it is not very popular anymore. ( d-oh! )

apart from all of the above reasons, if you are an X Files fan, well off course there is no other treasured collectible than this plus 8 other DVD sets ( i think 8, 9 were ok although to a lot of folks it was  a drag, but some of stories were good, especially in season 8 )

2434433,5,B000BOH98G,"After the first season which there was a certain unease on whether the show would continue, the second season brought on more episodes (this is probably the most prolific season with 25 episodes made) and more ambitious storyline and adding to its continuing mythology arc. However, they haven't quite yet perfected the consistency of the episodes so many of this season has great episodes sandwiched with too many decent or just altogether poor ones.

Little Green Men: Probably one of their best premieres as Mulder heads to Puerto Rico in hopes to make contact and get proof. His night encounter is quite tense. 9/10
The Host: Might make you paranoid about using toilets when a strange mutated creature is found in the city's sewer systems. 8.5/10
Blood: First of many decent episodes when messages encouraging mayhem appear on electronic devices. 6/10
Sleepless: A great standalone idea married with some mythology aspects when soldiers are found that haven't slept in over 20 years. Introduction of X and Alex Krycek. 8.5/10
Duane Barry: A man who believes he was abducted holds hostages and Mulder plays negotiator. Great cliffhanger ending. 9/10
Ascension: With Scully kidnapped by Barry, Mulder goes on an emotional search trying to find her. 9/10
3: Mulder's first official case without Scully and he's chasing vampires and again, it's just simply decent. 6.5/10
One Breath: An amazing episode as Scully unexpectedly returns in severe condition and Mulder does much soul searching in trying to save her. Duchovny's acting in this is spot-on. 9.5/10

Firewalker: With Scully officially back, their first case reunited is a lame redo of the season 1 ""Ice"" only this time they're stranded near a volcano with a dangerous scientist running loose. 6/10
Red Museum: Ties into the mythology but the episode itself is kind of meh as missing kids have been appearing with the phrase ""He/She is One"" on them. 7/10
Excelsis Dei: Finally a good ghost episode when they investigate strange occurences in a nursing home. 7.5/10
Aubrey: A surprisingly good episode as a detective finds she's somehow linked with a criminal from the past. 7.5/10
Irresistible: A series classic as Donnie Pfaster, a ""death fetishist"" preys on the living to extract hair and fingernails, has his eyes set on Scully. Probably the creepiest villain the show has had. 9/10
Die Hand Die Verletzt: Another great episode as they investigate murders ritualistic in nature and the devil-worshipping faculty might have a real demon in their staff. 9/10
Fresh Bones: Another decent episode about voodoo being practiced among a refugee population. Kind of forgettable actually. 5.5/10
Colony: A great mythology episode where an alien bounty hunter arrives killing identical doctors and Mulder receives a surprising visit. Probably the best cliffhanger the show ever had. 9.5/10

End Game: Conclusion to Colony as Mulder finds out more about the work done and travels to Alaska to find the bounty hunter and hopefully the whereabouts of his sister. 9.5/10
Fearful Symmetry: Kind of a silly episode about invisible animals rampaging through town and the safety of a sign language-speaking gorilla. 6/10
Dod Kalm: An interesting episode akin to Darkness Falls or Quagmire where they're found stranded on a shape where they age rapidly. Mulder's reaction to Scully's homemade juice is priceless. 8/10
Humbug: Their first comedic episode finds the agents in circus town where bizarre murders are found with the residents being even stranger. 9/10
The Calusari: More decent as the agents investigate possible demonic possession inside a young boy. 6/10
F. Emasculata: An interesting episode where a highly fatal contagion spreads among prison inmates and Mulder's manhunt for a possible infected convict. 8.5/10
Soft Light: Another late season highlight as a man has a shadow that kills thanks to a physics accident. 8/10
Our Town: Kind of disgusting/meh episode where chickens are fed ground up humans in hopes of longer life.
Anazasi: A great finale centering on 2 events: the downloading of government files and a boxcar unearthed gets Mulder even more proof except he's progressively getting more paranoid and violent. Great cliffhanger. 9.5/10

As you can see, the majority of the season (to me personally) is kind of hit and miss. Now and then they nail it on the head with a great episode but then other times there's others that don't have as much re-watchable value. But season 2 is where they were starting to find their footing and so the consistency started to get better as the show went on.",1186963200,4,4561,5.118120805369127

2434435,5,B000BOH98G,"`X-Files' Season 2, created by Chris Carter and starring David Duchovney and Gillian Anderson is entirely consistent in quality with Season 1, and everything I said about that release is true of this one as well.

One of the most distinguishing features of this season is that Ms. Anderson was pregnant throughout the first third of the season, and an arc of three shows was done to remove her from the scene while she was off on maternity leave. In spite of her delicate condition, the scripts continued to put her character and her costar into mortal danger in virtually every episode.

A second major distinction of this season is fact that `Deep Throat' from season 1 was killed off at the end of that season, to be replaced by a very similar character simply labeled `X'. This character was worked into the episodes when the `X-Files' unit of the FBI was reinstated about a third of the way into the season, just in time for Gillian to get back from her maternity leave.

The order of episode themes in this season is very similar to season 1, in that there is a rough alternation between Alien Visitor and homegrown weirdness. One of the very best episodes, `Humbug', which literally comes off as a comedy, involves virtually no paranormal activity at all. It almost seems like a take-off on the classic cult film `Freaks', made in the 1930s.

My biggest complaint about the premises underlying the entire series is the way in which agents of our government are split in four different antagonistic directions. First, there is the X-Files unit within the FBI, being our heroes, Muldur and Scully. Then there is the FBI hierarchy, represented primarily by Assistant Director Skinner. Then, there is the shadowy conglomerate of some other government agencies, primarily representing `the military', whose figurehead is `the cigarette smoking man'. Last, there is the `X' character, who represents some other shadowy conglomerate of government agencies who are seemingly on Muldur and Scully's side, but seem to offer nothing more than obscure clues and directions, when they feel like it (or more accurately, when the script needs a `deux ex machina' to move it along).

Another thing that tends to spoil things for me in some episodes is the degree to which the stories are stolen from other well-known works, the most common source being recent major films such as `The Exorcist'. I also get a bit antsy when a script misuses some arcane piece of scientific theory, as when `End Game' plays off the notion of `dark matter'. On the other hand, the season closing cliff-hanger episode manages to steal a march on a later film, `The Code Talkers', based on the use of the Navaho language as a code in the Pacific Theatre of Operations, which, according to both dramatic works, the Japanese were never able to crack or translate.

On the other hand, I really enjoy the occasional appearance of some interesting character actors in lead roles now and then. For example, I loved seeing `Mr. Monk' (Tony Shalhoub) in `End Game' and William Sanderson (an important minor character in `Blade Runner' and `Larry' from `Newhart') in the episode, `Blood', just as it was a gas to see Bradley Whitford as the leading guest character in a season 1 show.

Just like most modern dramas, one of the best features is the rapport between the two principal characters. This chemistry is shown in many ways, some quite subtle, as when both characters constantly answer their calls to their partner with the statement `It's me.' They even use this greeting when they meet one another unexpectedly. This rapport is often a major part of episodes, especially since one or both major characters is so often getting into perilous and quite deadly situations.

The extras are not `great', but they are interesting. The best thing about the set is that it is an excellent presentation of episodes from a major TV series. I will reinforce the impressions of other reviewers that this is done well, since they have probably seen more different series than I.

This series has become a minor milestone in TV history. It is not quite as iconic as `The Twilight Zone', but it is stronger than its inspiration, `The Night Stalker'. To my lights, it is also in general superior as Science Fiction than most `Star Trek' episodes from its various incarnations. I think it is more rewatchable than many series, if not quite as addicting for me as `The West Wing'.",1174089600,4,4431,4.827404479578393
2434436,3,B000BOH98G,"Things to consider about this product:

- Image and sound are not so good, especially because it's an old programme.

- It's 2.1 and not 5.1

- The package (the boxes) are too thin.

- It's much cheaper than the collector's edition but it does not include something important for collectors, the 7th CD with the extras!!

- I still do not understand why FOX overprices the collector's edition and makes it impossible for us to buy it. I think it is too expensive!! Besides if they want to save money in packaging, why did they eliminate the 7th cd? How much money can it cost to add that CD? Please!!!

- The series is excellent and worth watching.",1173916800,4,648,4.4033613445378155
2434437,5,B000BOH98G,"I wanted to point out something technical about the slim set discs that I bought.  If you're looking for insight into the episodes or characters - please look elsewhere.

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.  Sure, there are episodes I can skip through.  But for me, it's good bang for the buck.  Enjoy!",1172361600,6,2967,4.381651376146789
2434438,4,B000BOH98G,"most of the negative reviews for this product result from the fact that it's basically a repackaged version of the more expensive edition that was released previously.  despite being in full screen (it was shot in widescreen, but they dont' show up on dvd in 16X9 until season 5) and not having much in the way of bonus features, this is an excellent DVD set.  the X-files is one of the best shows that has been on TV and the second season is a dramatic improvement over the hit-and-miss first season (but not as good as season 4, which is one of the strongest seasons).",1171411200,5,570,4.419047619047619

NOTES: This review is for the original ""thick-pak"" set.  There are some SEASON ONE spoilers in this review.

As season 1 ended, the X-Files section had been shut down, and Mulder and Scully went their separate ways.  Mulder's confidante, Deep Throat, had been killed as Scully watched helplessly; and Mulder still had no concrete evidence pertaining to his sister's abduction.

David Duchovny (Fox Mulder) and Gillian Anderson (Dana Scully) immediately begin acting with confidence and seriousness towards their characters.  This is very evident in episode 1 - ""Little Green Men"".

Not much can be said in this review of season 2, as it is just as good as season 1, if not better.

Season 1 was a springboard for season 2 which fleshes out the main characters, and delves deeper into their pasts to find out what makes them tick.  The main difference between 1 and 2 are the numerous episodes devoted to character development and not actual X-Files.

New character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is Mulder's new partner as Scully returns to performing medicine.  Taking Deep Throat's position is Mr. X (played by Steven Williams), and Assistant Director Skinner gets much more exposure in season 2 (a function of Gillian Anderson who was pregnant at the time).

There are 2 two-part episodes:  ""Duane Berry"" and ""Ascension"", & ""Colony"" and ""End Game"".  These 4 episodes definitely have a short movie feel to them.

Again, like in season 1, the guest stars in season two are bountiful and surprising:  Tony Todd ('Candyman'), Steve Railsback ('Lifeforce'), Leland Orser ('Se7en'), John Savage ('The Deer Hunter'), Tony Shalhoub (TV's 'Monk') and more.  All these big names give the series credibility which would attract many more top-notch hotshots in future seasons.

Season 2 is a very good follow-up to season 1, and proves the series was not content to sit on its laurels, but delve deeper into the main characters and way-out X-Files subject matter.

My favorite episodes from season one are:
The Host - Maybe the most disturbing monster yet,
Red Museum - Why are kids disappearing, and then reappearing with ""He/She Is One"" written on their backs?,
Irresistible - Serial killer Donald Addie Pfaster (Nick Chinlund) is downright horrifying,
Dd Kalm - You've NEVER seen Mulder and Scully like this,
Soft Light - What a weird concept,
Our Town - Chicken anyone?, and
Anasazi - The last episode.

Least favorites are:
One Breath - Too slow,
Fresh Bones - A rip-off of 'The Serpent and the Rainbow"", and
The Calusari - This one rips-off 'The Omen' and 'The Exorcist'.

The audio is in dolby surround; and extras include a 15-minute documentary, show overviews by Carter, behind-the scenes clip, deleted scenes, special effects shots, 9 FX spots, 49 promotional TV spots, and an all-new DVD-ROM game ""Unholy Alliances"" which places you in the footsteps of a FBI agent.

If you have season 1, don't stop there...and if you don't?  Shame on you because this one only strengthens the fabric of science fiction and horror which was woven delicately in the series' debut season.",1168473600,,3094,4.988304093567251

2434442,5,B000BOH98G,"There are some really quality stand alones in Season 2 with ""Aubrey"" being my favorite. I've also always liked ""Humbug,"" which is quite humorous. Also, ""Irresistible"" is a must see, as there is a sequel in Season 7, ""Orison."" The actor who played Donny Pfaster (sp?) really stole the show out from under the leads. It's such a great episode for Scully's character. Some fans may not like the fact that Mulder and Scully have not grown into their relationship fully. There is not nearly as much sexual tension and jokes towards that end as in later episodes.

As far as mythology, this season is like a good refresher course. It's much easier to understand, seeing as the mythology gets much too convoluted and drawn out towards the end of the series. Even some of the stand alones relate to the mythology, which rarely happened in later seasons. I think the mythology and alien conspiracy are the anchors of this season; other seasons seem to concentrate on developing Mulder and Scully's relationship.",1167696000,2,1002,4.825581395348837
2434443,5,B000BOH98G,"Season 2 improves on the first season and gets a little more specific with what it tries to accomplish.  It brings more character development into the mix, bringing in Krycek, X, and a more developed Cigarette Smoking Man than we saw in Season 1.  It also surprised us with Scully's short-lived abduction during the amazing Duane Barry 2-parter, a first for the series at the time.  This season also introduced early on the hilarious comedy episodes (Humbug) as opposed to mythology or stand-alone episodes.  As with Season 1, the episodes here are generally very entertaining and keep you watching with a few exceptions as always (Die Hand die Verletzt, The Calusari, etc.), but as with the earlier episodes, the good ones overpower the bad ones.  As with Season 1 the extras mainly consist of deleted scenes, special effects clips, and international clips. Not great, but not bad.  You should be purchasing this at its budget price to see the episodes, that's the whole point.  If one more disc is that important, than you'll have to shell out over $100 most likely to get it.

2434444,5,B000BOH98G,"I never got the chance to see the X Files when it aired originally. I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,3,1436,4.7023809523809526

2434446,5,B000BOH98G,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. The inside DVD case is nothing special and even has some failings with some editions coming with a seventh bonus disc that is just sitting in a slot in a piece of card and falls out easily, bouncing around the box. However not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 discs in total but there is a bonus disc with 1 episode making it 25 episodes in total (see below for more details on this). Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Although X-Files: Season one landed like a bombshell on the international television scene, it was Season two that sent it flying up the rankings with Mulder and Scully on every magazine cover from the bottom to the top shelf. Season two kicks off from the cliff-hanger ending of Season one where the X-Files has been shutdown, Mulder and Scully have been reassigned to separate bureau departments and Deep throat has been murdered. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is in from the start, this time with a more active role in the field along with the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund), who are all reoccurring characters from Season one. Deep Throat has been replaced by a new Deep Throat character, the mysterious Mr X (Steven Williams) and Mulder has been teamed up with a new agent named Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) who may be working for the Cigarette-Smoking Man. There are also more revelations about Mulder's missing sister and some strange history about his dad. So the season starts very differently, upping the paranoia levels with a stronger focus on government conspiracy and developing this theme throughout most of the episodes. There is also much more hard-hitting action and gets very violent in parts with Scully even getting beaten-up badly in most episodes. Season one was more about delivering individual episodes covering a broad general range of paranormal topics whereas Season two links more episodes together by homing in on a unified underlying cause that the government is trying to protect. Still though there is plenty of room for the separate paranormal episodes that are just as good as the unified ones. Season two has a greater mix with much more original ideas than Season one did. It also boasts a lot of recognizable supporting actors you have seen in the movies. Season two of the X-Files is mostly about - SETI projects and the Wow Signal, mutants, toxins, military experiments, sleep deprivation, alien abductions, vampires, NDEs (near death experiences), ancient life forms, alien human hybridization, ghosts, fetishes, the devil, Wicca, voodoo,  alien bounty hunters, alien abduction of animals, rapid aging, circus freaks, demonic possession, viruses, dark matter and cannibalism. In Season two the episodes are more logical than Seasone one, less general weirdness, and more explanation, but still has some rough edges, and questionable moves by the main characters at times, but that is only cribbing. `The Anasazi' is the most popular show in Season Two and also the cliff-hanger last episode, but `Duane Barry' `Ascension' and `One Breath' are all classic episodes about Scully's abduction. `The Host' is a great monster story and `The Calusari' is very freaky. `Our Town' is downright horrific. In fact `The Calusari' caused the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) to give the whole Season box an 18 certificate (strictly for adults only) because of scenes involving children committing murder (the BBFC has banned these types of films before, so the UK was lucky to even get the 18 cert). The episode also had strong themes of child murder and violence towards children. There are a number of episodes that contain totally gross content that is hard to stomach. `3' could be the worst X-File episode of all time. It really stands out as a poor episode among the rest. The bottom line for The X-Files: season two is that it is widely considered by fans to be the best season of them all. The last episode is a great way to finish off the season with lots of revelations and some more exposure of what the truth might be. There are quite a few `to be continued' double episodes in this season also. This season has 25 episodes!, the most any X-Files season has to offer but as a note, watch out for the last episode ""The Anasazi"" which may not be on the last episode disc but is on the seventh bonus disc (the only episode on that disc)!",1149033600,8,7358,4.811216429699842
2434447,3,B000BOH98G,"The handful of ""mythology"" episodes in season two, ""Duane Barry,"" ""Little Green Men,"" ""Ascension,"" ""One Breath,"" ""Red Museum,"" ""Colony,"" ""End Game,"" and ""Anasazi,"" truly grip the viewer, but the stand-alone episodes are equally compelling.

Whereas the picture quality of the DVDs in season one of the rereleased edition is good, for the most part, season two falls far short in this regard. The picture is grainy bordering on blurry. Images lack depth and detail, often appearing out of focus. I have twenty-year-old VHS movies that look better. The Dolby Digital two-channel sound, on the other hand, is clear and well balanced.

Extras are scant, as would be expected. They include several unnecessary foreign-language clips (Japanese, German, Spanish, and Italian), a couple of deleted scenes, and a couple of special-effects clips.

The no-frills packaging consists of an insubstantial slipcase housing three second-rate DVD cases, which hold a total of six discs. Some of the discs I have appear to have been manhandled in the assembly lines, bearing scratches and smears.

Aside from making Fox Studios richer, there really was no need for this edition of The X-Files. The overpriced original sets should have sold at the price this shoddy edition sells for.

2434458,5,B000BOH98G,"THE X FILES is absolutely my most favorite show of all time. I just bought seasons 4,5,6 and 9 and love them all. But nothing can come close to the first three seasons, and season 2 of this sci-fi hit is superb from start to finish. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson once again prove why they are the stars, with every episode twisting and turning like knives in your back.

Of the episodes included here, the standouts are the stellar ""The Host"", the two-part nailbiter ""Colony/End Game"", and the true life freaks that are on hand for the terrifying carnival of ""Humbug"". ""Colony/End Game"" nearly brings Mulder closer to re-uniting with his sister, while ""The Host"" answers the question of what inhabits the sewer plant. Cliffhanger ""Anasazi"" is one of the most exciting of the 20th century, with Mulder's father being murdered and the answers so far away. It's one of the most intense episodes you'll ever bear witness to in your life.

So right along with Season 1 and Season 3, THE X FILES proved itself to be hands down the most superb sci-fi series right with Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Twilight Zone. Mulder and Scully will always be two of the best detectives that television has had the chance to bear witness to, and you'll find much to enjoy with this fantastic second helping of a show that changed television, and our view of government, forever.",1137888000,,1373,4.6929460580912865
2434459,5,B000BOH98G,"I've blasted Twentieth Century Fox over and over the past few years for not making THE X-FILES available in an affordable edition.  I was especially miffed this past year as they brought out the inexpensive but incomplete Mythology editions.  Finally they have given us an edition that recollects the original DVD releases but in a new format and a dramatically lower price.  For anyone with even the slightest doubt, this is the edition of THE X-FILES to get.  Although I like to collect my favorite shows on DVD, and I consider THE X-FILES to be one of my two or three favorite shows ever, I have not bought any season, opting instead to rent and rerent the discs from Netflix.  Partly this was because I am on a budget and partly because I revolt at paying over $40 for any television season.  Once we consumers start paying those kinds of rates, the producers will provide us with nothing priced lower.  I was determined either to wait the folks at Twentieth Century Fox out or give Netflix a lot of X-FILES rentals.  To complicate matters, buying the seasons used is complicated by the fact that so many sellers on Amazon and elsewhere are actually selling cheap Hong Kong rip offs, not a very good option.  Now, however, we not only can pay a reasonable price, but a better format, with the slim line cases that are both longer-lasting than the original fold out cases and more aesthetically pleasing.

There are two major differences between Season One and Season Two of THE X-FILES. First, there is an overall increase in the quality of individual episodes. The writing and production in Season One was very sharp, but the writing was even more finely honed in the second season. Even in the episodes that dealt with the ""phenomena of the week,"" there is a persistent increase in the quality of the new characters introduced and the complexity of the situations. In other words, there is no sophomore slump for these guys. The second major difference is a slight increase in the complexity of the back story. Partially this is done by a couple of multi-episode stories and partially by developing the longer arc of a complex and nefarious conspiracy of silence on the part of a shadowy federal agency that seems to be connected with the Department of Defense. There is a great deal of character development, especially of secondary characters. The Deep Throat of Season One has been replaced by a new Deep Throat, a highly placed African-American played convincingly by Steven Williams who is far more ruthless than the original Deep Throat. Assistant Deputy Director Skinner becomes a far more important character, one whose loyalties are hard to place, but one who clearly is capable of at times being Mulder and Scully's most loyal friend, though more frequently their taskmaster and disciplinarian. The Smoking Man continues to lurk in the shadows, radiating patronizing tyranny and an aura of conspiratorial intrigue. He was a presence in the first season, but he becomes a full fledged character in the second, moving from a non-talking character to one who talks a fair amount.  Even Mulder and Scully, who were magnificently conceived characters from the very first episode, learn new things that show their lives to be more complex than they had suspected (and in the two shows that begin Season Three that complete the story that begins in the final episode of Season Two show that there is much, much more to learn than they even remotely suspect).

The start of the season finds Scully in a coma, the X-Files unit disbanded, and Mulder assigned to outrageously trivial surveillance work. Of course, all works out in a series of spectacular episodes. Those fans of Gillian Anderson's crystal blue-eyed, porcelain beauty might notice that she doesn't look quite as lovely early in the season, a function partly of a terrible hairstyling mistake (her bob with bangs instead of her usual part, which utterly alters the balance of her face) and partly of her being extremely pregnant. I applaud the makers of the show for not trying to work her pregnancy into the story line, instead hiding it use of the billowing trench coats that help constitute Scully and Mulder's uniforms. The pregnancy is easy to see in her face, it getting rounder and fuller as she got further into the pregnancy. In fact, if you do a screenshot of her in her last episodes before having her daughter, and compare it to one from an episode either early in Season One or from Season Three, the difference in her face is dramatic. Pregnancies are always hard to work around, but this is one of the more interesting attempts in TV history for their refusal to work it into the plot. Amazingly, she filmed the extraordinary pair of episodes ""Duane Barry"" and ""Ascension"" while very close to term.  There is absolutely no more terrifying image in all of THE X-FILES than that of the glimpse of Scully's gagged face in the trunk of Duane Barry's stolen car from the video camera of a police car.  One has to admire the professionalism of an actress who will climb gagged into a car trunk

One thing that is not frequently noted is how unusual both Mulder and Scully are from most action heroes. Neither has especial physical prowess. In fact, it is hard to recall a time when Mulder has come out on top in a scuffle. These guys are not street fighters, and while each can often be found drawing their guns when exploring a room or building, they are not by television standards trigger happy individuals. Furthermore, only rarely do they come across as being in absolute control of situations. They are not forceful individuals, either physically or in personality. They tend to back down a lot. They do not throw their authority around very often, not merely, I suspect, because they do not trust that judges will back them up, but because their style is more to persuade and cajole rather than to force. They stand in stark contrast to all similar characters in action or FBI shows.

My one complaint with Season Two is that there is too much emphasis on individual shows. I'm sure much of the cause of this was pressure from network execs to limit the multi-episode stories. Also, the creators themselves were not quite certain to what degree they wanted to emphasize the ""Mythology"" shows.  Certainly many of the single episode shows are absolutely outstanding. For instance, the one featuring Jim Rose and The Enigma from the Jim Rose Freak Show is incredibly entertaining (as well as quite funny, with the most unique ending of an evil entity in the first two seasons of the show) as well as shocking; it is one thing to see The Enigma shoveling living bugs down his throat (in their stage show, he eats worse, including glass and worms), but it is rather surprising when Scully snacks on a grasshopper (something that interviews confirm was not faked, though her producing the grasshopper later through sleight of hand was). But as fine as many of the individual episodes are, the series rises to a completely different level in those episodes that expand to two or three episodes. The stand alone episodes make great TV, but the multi-episode arcs make spectacular television. I always experience a sense of disappointment when I realize an arc has ended and we have returned to the X-File-of-the-Week format.

Those who have not yet seen THE X-FILES in their entirety are lucky because they can now work their way all the way through the series season by season, not having to wait a week (or several months in the case of season-ending cliffhangers) to see what happens next, and being able to watch them in pristine DVD without having to be interrupted by inane commercials (is ""inane commercial"" redundant?). This is television as fine as it has ever gotten.  And now thanks to the new slim format sets, they are affordable as well.",1137715200,16,7829,4.7816432272390825
2434460,5,B000BOH98G,"The mythology takes a major step forward with ""Duane Barry"" and it's follow up episode. The second season found the show stepping away from its inspirations and creating its own formidable backstory for the series. Among the outstanding episodes are ""Sleepless"",""Colony"", ""End Game"", ""The Host"" and ""One Breath"". So what's the difference between this ""Second Season"" set and the previous edition?

The packaging with all of the disks in slimline boxes (the really skinny DVD boxes)is a good thing. The previous set unfolded with the disks and as the sets aged the disks could easily fall out. You can't replace the other set but you can buy more DVD slimline holders to replace the originals here when they begin to break.

All of the extras on the regular DVDs are, however, the same including any deleted scenes, etc. that were on the previous set.  This is a good thing because the original fold out DVD packaging was a bit of a pain and didn't hold up to wear and tear all that well.

There aren't any new extras and the show looks the same (it's the same transfers with the discs pressed from the same digital masters). You're just getting the show at a reduced cost with better packaging. It's a good deal for a great season of television. I'm surprised that Fox didn't repackage these into half season sets like they have with ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" and ""The Time Tunnel"".",1135641600,23,1599,4.639575971731449

So if you don't already own them you might want to wait another 6 or 7 weeks and we'll be able to get a full season of the X-Files for the same price as a full season of other great dramas like CSI and Lost.

2434465,5,B000BOH98G,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 2) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""Little Green Men"" in which we learn the fate of our heroes in the aftermath of the closing of The X-Files. Scully is working as an FBI instructor at Quantico while Mulder is tasked with an endless array of mundane ""busy-work"". But Mulder refuses to quit. He meets with one his supporters in regard to The X-File project - Senator Matheson, and the meeting prompts him to investigate an abandoned SETI site in New Mexico which might hold clues to the existence of alien life-forms... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""One Breath"" in which Scully ends up in a coma for reasons unknown and Mulder must find out the truth about what happened to her, and ""Fearful Symmetry"" in which Scully and Mulder investigate a series of attacks at a zoo perpendicular to a tract of land notorious for its UFO sightings...

2434466,5,B000BOH98G,"The X-Files really took off in its second season with a series of episodes of consistent quality.  This may be one of the finest sustained performances in television history.  We learn more about Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) as the respect and affection between them deepens, and the all-important supporting cast is developed as well.  There is more screen time for Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), the assistant director whose ultimate loyalties were, at this point, unknown and the unambiguously evil Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis).  We also meet members of Mulder and Scully's families as well as new additions such as X (Stephen Williams) and the duplicitous Krychek (Nicholas Lea).

It's hard to single out quality episodes, but I'd have to go with ""Duane Berry/Ascension"" (the mythology episodes really start cooking here), ""Colony/Endgame"" (we learn that there definitely are aliens on Earth), ""Irresistable"" (a scary one about a death fetishist), and ""Humbug"" (the first truly comedic episode).

Season 2 defied expectations and the show became an even bigger hit. Not one weak episode is contained withing these 25 legendary episodes. Season 2 is legendary, a legendary accomplishment in television history. Don't pass up this DVD set. Below is an episode  guide. SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!

Little Green Men: the X-Files have been closed down, and Mulder and  Scully are separated. But that doesn't stop Mulder from going to Puerto Rico to find proof of aliens.

The Host: Mulder investigates a monster living in the Newark sewer system. Scully discovers that it is part fluke worm.

Blood: messages displayed on electronic devices are acting upon peoples phobias, making them kill.

Sleepless: Mulder gets a new partner, Alex Krycek, and they go and investigate the death of several Vietnam war vets. We see X for the first time in this episode.

Ascenscion: Duane Barry has kidnapped Scully, and Mulder pursues him to Skyland Mountain where Scully has seemed to have disappeared.

One Breath: Best episode of the season! Scully is found, but she's in a coma. Mulder tries to find the people who did it to her, and what exactly happened to her.

Red Museum: Mulder and Scully investigate several teenagers who have writing on their back, and can't remember a thing.

>""The Host""- a half man half flukeworm creature is on the loose.

>""Blood""- a truly scary episode in which electronic devises tell people to act on their worst phobias.

>""One Breath""- a very touching episode in which Scully is returned after her abduction and she struggles to hold on to life.

>""Irresistible""- Scully is kidnapped by a death-fettishist who may possibly be a demon of some sort.

>""End Game""- a mythology episode that is wrought with emotion and some questions are actually answered.

>""Humbug""- a comedic episode that involves contortionists, conjoined twins, and more.

>""Soft Light""- an incredibly sad episode about a physics expiriment gone terribly wrong.

>""Our Town""- Cannibalism doesn't pay in the land of Chako Chicken.",1114905600,2,1019,4.988165680473373
2434469,5,B000BOH98G,"If you're not already addicted by the time you have finished the first season ,then you will be by the end of this one.

Picking right up where it left off in season one, Mulder and Scully continue their investigation into all things paranormal and unexplained.

Probably just a tad better than season one, contains some absolute gems such as "" The Host "", "" Dunae Barry "" "" Ascension "" "" Colony "" End Game "" and "" Anasazi ""

This season is quite remarkable as Scully is abducted by forces unknown and disappears. In real life Gillian Anderson was pregnant, and the writers of the show incorporated her pregancy ingeniously into the show.

But you will have to watch for yourselves to see how they do it!

The other thing that season two developed was the expanding storylines of what are known as the "" Mythology "" episodes.

These are episodes that surround Mulders belief that Earth is being visited by Aliens, and there is a conspiracy of men on Earth who know about this, and are aiding and abetting the Aliens for reasons yet unclear.

The season ends on a cliffhanger which was repeated successfully in coming seasons.

A truly great show, and a must for any sort of X-File fan.

""X"", Mulder's informant, is also introduced in this season.  There are also a lot of pretty good stand-alone episodes.  ""Bloodless"" was very interesting.

Once you see it, this episode will leave you hungering to see what happens next in Season 3 of the X-Files.",1102377600,2,548,4.577319587628866
2434472,5,B000BOH98G,"There are two major differences between Season One and Season Two of THE X-FILES.  First, there is an overall increase in the quality of individual episodes.  The writing and production in Season One was very sharp, but the writing was even more finely honed in the second season.  Even in the episodes that dealt with the ""phenomena of the week,"" there is a persistent increase in the quality of the new characters introduced, and the complexity of the situations.  In other words, there is no sophomore slump for these guys.  The second major difference is a slight increase in the complexity of the back story.  Partially this is done by a couple of multi-episode stories and partially by developing the longer arc of a complex and nefarious conspiracy of silence on the part of a shadowy federal agency that seems to be connected with the Department of Defense.  There is a great deal of character development, especially of secondary characters.  The Deep Throat of Season One has been replaced by a new Deep Throat, a highly placed African-American who is far more ruthless than the original Deep Throat.  Assistant Deputy Director Skinner becomes a more important character, one whose loyalties are hard to place, but one who clearly is capable of at times being Mulder and Scully's most loyal friend, though more frequently their taskmaster and disciplinarian.  The Smoking Man continues to lurk in the shadows, radiating patronizing tyranny and an aura of conspiratorial intrigue.  Even Mulder and Scully, who were magnificently conceived characters from the very first episode, learn new things that show their lives to be more complex than they had suspected (and in the two shows that begin Season Three that complete the story that begins in the final episode of Season Two show that there is much, much more to learn than they even remotely suspect).

The start of the season finds Scully in a coma, the X-Files unit disbanded, and Mulder assigned to outrageously trivial surveillance work.  Of course, all works out in a series of spectacular episodes.  Those fans of Gillian Anderson's crystal blue-eyed, porcelain beauty might notice that she doesn't look quite as lovely early in the season, a function partly of a terrible hairstyling mistake (her bob with bangs instead of her usual part, which utterly alters the balance of her face) and partly of her being extremely pregnant.  I applaud the makers of the show for not trying to work her pregnancy into the story line, instead hiding it use of the billowing trench coats that help constitute Scully and Mulder's uniforms.  The pregnancy is easy to see in her face, it getting rounder and fuller as she got further into the pregnancy.  In fact, if you do a screenshot of her in her last episodes before having her daughter, and compare it to one from an episode either early in Season One or from Season Three, the difference in her face is dramatic.  Pregnancies are always hard to work around, but this is one of the more interesting attempts in TV history for their refusal to work it into the plot.

One thing that is not frequently noted is how unusual both Mulder and Scully are from most action heroes.  Neither has especial physical prowess.  In fact, it is hard to recall a time when Mulder has come out on top in a scuffle.  These guys are not street fighters, and while each can often be found drawing their guns when exploring a room or building, they are not trigger happy individuals.  Furthermore, only rarely do they come across as being in absolute control of situations.  They are not forceful individuals, either physically or in personality.  They tend to back down a lot.  They do not throw their authority around very often, not merely, I suspect, because they do not trust that judges will back them up, but because their style is more to persuade and cajole rather than to force.  They stand in stark contrast to all similar characters in action or FBI shows.

My one complaint with Season Two is that there is too much emphasis on individual shows.  I'm sure much of the cause of this is pressure from network execs to limit the multi-episode stories.  Certainly many of the single episode shows are absolutely outstanding.  For instance, the one featuring Jim Rose and The Enigma from the Jim Rose Freak Show is incredibly entertaining (as well as quite funny, with the most unique ending of an evil entity in the first two seasons of the show) as well as shocking; it is one thing to see The Enigma shoveling living bugs down his throat (in their stage show, he eats worse), but it is rather surprising when Scully snacks on a grasshopper (something that interviews confirm was not faked, though her producing the grasshopper later through sleight of hand was).  But as fine as many of the individual episodes are, the series rises to a completely different level in those episodes that expand to two or three episodes.  The stand alone episodes make great TV, but the multi-episode arcs make spectacular television.  I always experience a sense of disappointment when I realize an arc has ended and we have returned to the X-File-of-the-Week format.

Those who have not yet seen THE X-FILES in their entirety are lucky because they can now work their way all the way through the series season by season, not having to wait a week (or several months in the case of season-ending cliffhangers) to see what happens next, and being able to watch them in pristine DVD without having to be interrupted by inane commercials (is ""inane commercial"" redundant?).  This is television as fine as it has ever gotten.",1095033600,13,5602,4.811064718162839
2434473,4,B000BOH98G,"Seasons two, three, and four remain my favorite of the X-Files series. But it is season two that truly introduces us to Scully and Mulder and gives us more insight into who they are and their relationship to one another. The Duane Barry/Ascension/One Breath arc was really the high point of the season. Scully gets abducted (it might still be a mystery by exactly whom) and when she returns, we see the depth of feeling Mulder has for Scully, and vice versa. Their love and respect for each other seems to run deeper than just romance and that seems to be the factor that made X-Files fans such ardent X-Files fans.

Anasazi is also an excellent episode and serves as a nice introduction for season three. I would definitely recommend seeing all of these episodes, but I think the DVD collection is overpriced. I've bought Alias and Buffy DVD sets for under fifty dollars, so I'm at a loss as to why they've priced these at seventy to eighty dollars.",1091404800,6,950,4.588235294117647

Season 2 is where an actuall mythology really gets developed and used throughout the entire season that helps link episodes together and get an ultimate story underway.  This season also starts the use of comedy in the series (ex. 'Humbug') and contains, my favorite episode of the x-files 'Duane Berry'.
The DVD set packs quite a few extras and is better quality then youll get on TNT or SCI-FI, and you can watch all your episodes in order. If you were only going to buy one season of the x-files I'd recommend season 3, but if you were going to buy two seasons, I'd recommend seasons 2 and 3.",1088640000,,704,4.285714285714286
2434476,5,B000BOH98G,"With the second season ""The X-Files"" raised the bar and managed to maintain a series of excellent seasons through the sixth. After that, the distraction from the production of the movie and Carter's other lesser series (""Millenium"" which borrowed the look and texture of ""Seven"")began to take its toll. Nevertheless, even season seven was far above average.

The story arc involving the alien conspiracy kicks into high gear and all the major players are in place by the time of the second season. Season two starts off with ""The X-Files"" closed down. Mulder and Scully have been reassigned nevertheless, ""X"" is Mulder's friend inside the FBI. Eventually, the X-Files are reopened and Mulder & Scully discover far deeper mysteries than they ever imagined during season one. The highlight of season two, for me, is ""Duane Barry"" and ""Ascension"". Production values are up as well during this season which means that the effects and sets improved. It's clear that Fox released they had a hit on their hands.

We get all the original broadcast episodes with the addition of Chris Carter's commentary on nearly half of the season. There's also international clips (which are always good for a chuckle)and also a number of great extras. What matters is whether or not the set is worth it based on A) The quality of the episodes and B) The quality of the transfers.

A) The writing establihed a benchmark that all other series (from ""CSI"" to ""Buffy"")benefited from. While Carter may have been inspired by ""The Night Stalker"" television series, he way beyond that series with drama that could hold its own with the best of mainstream television.
B) The picture isn't always as clear as it could be but, again, we've got nearly 4 hours of complex images on one dual layer disc. There are artifacts visible throughout. Around the fourth season the transfer improve signficantly by the way.

The opener, ""Little Green Men"", is a little weak.  But immediately thereafter ""The Host""...a memorable and great episode, and the introduction of Alex Krycek...picked up the momentum.
""Blood"" is an inventive and scary little tale.  ""Sleepless"", with the introduction of X, is another classic.  ""Colony-End Game"" is one of the weaker mythology arc stories  (though note the intro. of the Mulder family), but some of the finest stand-alones ever are here:  ""Irresistible"", ""Die Hand Die Verletzt"", ""Humbug""  (one of the all-time classics), ""Our Town""  (an underappreciated gem), ""F. Emasculata""  (another underappreciated gem, and one of the key episodes in the Cancer Man mythology).
Fox does a great job with the packaging.  Don't miss this season if you're buying them selectively.  And for the devoted X-Philes, you don't need to be told how great this season is.",1085961600,,923,5.303448275862069
2434479,5,B000BOH98G,"It was very early in the second season that I got my first whiff of THE X-FILES. I remember walking into my parents' bedroom one night and seeing my dad watching something on TV---some scary story about a human flukeworm. I am referring, of course, to the season's well-known second episode ""The Host,"" and it was from that episode on that I was hooked on the show, with its glorious mix of the creepy, the paranormal, and the paranoid.
I recently decided to start collecting all nine seasons of THE X-FILES on DVD, and while of course the logical thing to do is to start with the very first season, I simply could not resist starting the collection off with this DVD set of the complete second season. There are just too many memorable moments in this season to count! I don't dare pick one lone favorite episode from any of the 25, since almost all of them have something stimulating or just plain freaky in them---and even comparatively weaker episodes at least have Mark Snow's brilliant (if sometimes repetitive) underscore to set a properly scary mood.
**********
So, some personal highlights from this great season:
""The Host"": the first X-FILES episode I ever saw
Scully's abduction in the ""Duane Barry/Ascension"" mytharc, which leads to her emotional return in ""One Breath"" (David Duchovny affectingly portraying Mulder's anger and frustration)---certainly one of the better mytharcs, although for me it is topped by...
Mulder's sister's supposed return in ""Colony/Endgame,"" still for me the best, most gripping two-parter the show ever conceived
""Irresistible"" saw a very vulnerable Scully clearly rattled by a case involving a death fetishist (chillingly played by Nick Chinlund) who is now resorting to murder to satisfy his twisted mores. One of the more disturbing stand-alone X-FILES episodes of the season, and one that doesn't skimp on character development, like some other stand-alones do
""Dod Kalm"" is not an episode that is mentioned a lot by fans, as far as I know, but I think its moody, contemplative, slow-moving flow---as well as some priceless interaction between our two heroes at the end---works to make this a highlight of the season (despite the contrivances and the cheesy make-up on the aging Mulder and Scully, although I find the latter at least to be forgivable here)
""Humbug,"" the first ""humorous"" X-FILES episode from writer Darin Morgan, and a rightful classic
""F. Emasculata"" shows one of the show's best directors, Rob Bowman (he of course directed the X-FILES movie), in top form, sustaining considerable tension in a tale about a deadly plague and efforts to keep it under control (and under wraps). Sure, it's derivative of the movie OUTBREAK, and yea it's gross, but it still works
And of course the cliffhanger at the end of ""Anasazi,"" one of the better season-ending cliffhangers of the show
**********
This was the season that expanded the popularity of THE X-FILES, and it is not hard to see why: gripping stories, consistently good acting from Duchovny and Anderson, and the fact that it touches upon a chord of paranoia that has always been an undercurrent in this country. I will always have a soft spot for Season 2 of THE X-FILES---and even though the show died out with a disappointing whimper by the end of the ninth season, the show will always have its rightful place in television history, if not all of sci-fi/horror history too.",1085961600,2,3389,4.947368421052632
2434480,5,B000BOH98G,"For the two-parters, ""Duane Barry/Ascension"" and ""Colony/Endgame"" alone, this compilation would be well worth the price. But considering this season was filled with so many other stand-out episodes AND that the seeds of the ""intergalactic conspiracy"" storyline (I don't know what else to call it) were planted here, this is the essential collection for any X-Files fan. You cannot go from the first season to the third and expect to know what's going on--you would miss too many critical details by skipping over season two. Besides that, you would be missing some of the most inspired writing of the X-Files' long history of great scripts.",1085875200,2,640,5.104761904761904
2434481,4,B000BOH98G,"X-Files was always a show that I was very curious about, but I simply never had the time to catch the show on FOX, or the money to shell out for the expensive DVD sets. However, now that the prices have been reduced, I have been able to start watching the show on DVD. The first season did a great job at establishing Mulder and Scully and was very good overall. The second season of X-Files manages to be just as good or even slightly better than the previous season. It features the ultimate in alien mythology with ""Little Green Men"", ""Duane Berry"" ""Ascension"", ""Colony"", ""Endgame"", and the great season ending cliffhanger "" Anasazi"". There are also creepy episodes like "" Die Hand die Verletzt"" in which a Satanic cult is focused on, ""Irresistible"" which has a serial killer target Scully, ""One Breath"" which deals with Scully's near death experience and the afterlife, ""3"" which deals with vampires, and ""Calusari"" which deals with the possesion of a child.
As a new fan to the show, I can honestly say that I am glad that I started watching because X-Files is so entertaining that you almost become addicted to it. However, as good as season 2 was, it still enforces my one complaint about the show so far. X-Files offers great characters and many good episodes, but lacks consistancy. There was times during season 2 where I was blown away by how good an episode was, and then there would be 2-3 episodes in a row that were bordering on almost being boring. The second season features 25 episodes, and I would have to say that at least 7-8 episodes were not all that great. Don't get me wrong, X-Files is still an amazing show. The writing, directing, effects, and performances from the actors are all first rate. But with the lack of consistancy this show demonstrates, I could only give the second season of X-Files a four star rating.
The DVD set is first rate once again. I love the fact that the set included series creator Chris Carter talking about his 12 favorite episodes from the second season, just like the first season DVD set did. I love hearing an insider's perspective on the show, and who better than the man who created the show? There are also deleted scenes, and behind the scenes clips as well.
A solid 4 stars...",1085875200,,2241,4.577114427860696
2434482,5,B000BOH98G,"In this second season of The X-Files, the creators realized where they could take this show, since the first season was successful enough. They started to build a mythology dealing with the plot of aliens, UFOs, government coverups, abductions, etc. And they still had wonderful stand-alone episodes as well.
The episodes that really started a mythology was the two parter Duane Barry/Ascension. Scully gets kidnapped by a man who's being controled by aliens through the alien implant in his body. Later, she gets abducted by aliens in his place. This lead to a mythology plot that lasted for 3 more years dealing with Scully receiving cancer because of this event. These two episodes were written because Gillian Anderson(Scully) was pregnant, so she had to be off the show for a couple episodes. She was actually showing at the end of the first season and the beginning of this season. This just goes to show you that what seems like an inconvenience in TV show writing can turn out to be one of the best decisions ever made.
The season finale ended with a cliffhanger that lead into the first two episodes of the third season. Watching these episodes, it really became clear that this show was a hit.
I loved this season, and it's a must have for X-Fans.
Great season, great DVD.",1080777600,2,1282,4.753363228699552
2434483,5,B000BOH98G,"I remember when this series started, and the hint of dissapointment was hanging in the air. I'm giving it 5 stars because it's the X Files but in all honesty it's probobaly not worth all of them. This season has a surprising amount of duds and it's a real shame that you have to look upon the grimness of a pregnant Gillian Anderson throughout the first ten or so episodes. Aside from that though it still has episodes that stand out from the rest and Gillian's pregnancy was something of a blessing for the show in the long run. Duane Barry was the first ever two parter brought on by her, and the story of her abduction that the show tended to revolve around later was written in as a result of her pregnancy too.
It's got it's gems and you shouldn't be too dissapointed with the rest of them. (They take seven any day and I won't even bother mentioning eight and nine).
The episodes of pure television genius in this season are-
Sleepless
Duane Barry
Ascension
Fire Walker
Colony
End Game
Dod Calm
The Calusari
F. Emasculata
Soft Light
Anasazi
Little Green men would have made it on but it's a little over the top and flawed. For instance, when Scully forgets to feed the fish in Mulders apartment, and the way those idiots are following her around at the air port. (They couldn't have made it any more obvious that they were following her if they had a sign saying, 'Dana Scully-were watching you.')

2434485,5,B000BOH98G,"After the surprise success of the first season of The X-Files, the second season built on it's momentum, and this is where the true genius of the show began to take shape.  With The X-Files themselves now closed; Mulder and Scully find themselves in the middle of a hinted global conspiracy involving aliens, genetic experimentation, a shape changing alien bounty hunter (Brian Thompson) and Mulder's own father and the truth behind his sister's abduction.  New and ultimately pivotal characters were introduced: sneaky FBI Agent Alex Krychek, the mysterious Mr. X (Steven Williams), and the roles of the Cancer Man (William B. Davis) and A.D. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) were given much more credibility and screen time.  Stand out episodes include the Season 2 premiere Little Green Men and Humbug where Mulder and Scully investigate a chain of bizarre murders at a freak side show (always a favorite episode of mine); but some of the best episodes in the entire series are found here with Duane Barry and Ascension where the truth about alien life is brought to the forefront and Scully herself is abducted.  As great as Season 2 of the X-Files is though, it would only be a sample of the greatness to come.",1061510400,3,1206,4.897058823529412
2434486,5,B000BOH98G,"This is the most profound show in science fiction since Star Trek.  It possesses so many good elements of the genre.  Mystery, monsters, and the struggle between good and evil are paramount in the world of the X-files.
This season picks up where the last left off as the ""X-Files"" have been shut down, Mulder and Scully have been reassigned, and the fight for the truth is in peril.  These episodes are some of the strongest in the series.  The new informant, who took the place of ""Deep Throat,"" is very strong.  Assistant Director Skinner's role is brought to the forefront as it is difficult to see where his loyalties lie.
Some of the craziest episodes of the series are in season 2.  The drama revolving around the abduction of Scully in ""Duane Barry"" and her return in ""One Breath"" is probably some of the most intense in the nine years that this show graced the airwaves.

I LOVE the x-files, but I never got to watch it when it was running on tv. This was great. A definate five stars and a good reccomendation to anyone.",1049241600,2,289,5.304347826086956
2434488,5,B000BOH98G,"The final episode in Season One of The X-Files, ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" proved that this show could go from excellent to flat out stunning. In this episode, Deep Throat was killed and The X-Files was closed down. It truly was a superb season finale and helped the show continue for a second season, which was a million times better. Season Two gained The X-Files popular critical and commercial acclaim, in which the show won awards at the Golden Globes, Digital Hollywood Awards, Saturn Awards and the Environmental Media Awards. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully respectively were born to play these roles and this aspect is what makes the show so excellent.

Season Two picks up where Season One left off with the episode ""Little Green Men."" This is where the mythology arc of the show really begins to take off. Mulder races to make contact with a downed UFO before a secret government team can cover it up. ""Duane Barry,"" the Emmy-nominated episode, is another in the mythology arc in which a gunman who claims to have been the subject to alien experimentation holds Mulder and a handful of others hostage. ""Ascension"" is kind of the conclusion of the previous episode (Duane Barry), in which the gunman takes Scully hostage and takes her up onto a mountain top and has her abducted by unseen forces so that they will leave him alone. Scully fights for her life in the episode ""One Breath"" after been deposited back onto Earth.

The Season Two two-parter in the form of ""Colony"" and ""End Game"" is undoubtedly some of the most gripping, enthralling and absorbing episodes in X-Files history. Mulder makes a stunning discovery regarding his missing sister, who he believes was abducted when she was only a young girl. Scully's life is also in danger when an alien bounty hunter tracks her down. These aliens have the ability to take the identical form of anyone they want to. The scene where the alien appears to be Mulder and goes to Scully's apartment, only for the real Mulder to ring Scully's mobile is one of the most symbolic scenes in the history of the show. Scully is taken hostage by these bounty hunters and Mulder must rescue her, but discovers a shocking alien plan to colonise the Earth. In the final mythology episode of Season Two - ""Anasazi"" - things get really ugly for the agents when Mulder's father is killed by Alex Krycek, Mulder's enemy who works side by side with the Cigarette-Smoking Man. Mulder and Scully also uncover a chilling link between a UFO cover-up and secret government experiments in a huge box buried underground in New Mexico. There are bodies everywhere...bodies of aliens. One cannot describe the suspense a fan experiences between the end of this episode and the Season 3 opener which concludes this Season Two finale. Absolutely amazing.

The stand-alone episodes of this season include ""The Host,"" ""Blood,"" ""Sleepless,"" ""3,"" ""Firewalker,"" ""Red Museum,"" ""Excelsius Dei,"" ""Aubrey,"" ""Fresh Bones,"" ""Soft Light"" and ""Our Town."" One of the best stand-alone episodes is ""Irresistible."" The agents track down a death fetishist whose horrifying obsession involves removing hair and fingernails of dead women. The way the man acts all kind and friendly makes it all the more freaky, especially when Scully (who is having trouble dealing with the case) is taken hostage by the man. In ""Die Hand Die Verletzt,"" the agents persue a group of school teachers who worship the devil led by a Satan-worshipping and demonic substitute teacher. Scenes such as the one with the snake in the basement is one of the most famous scenes in the show's history and you'll feel like crying when the teenage girl tells the agents about her horrifying experiences with these teachers - two of whom are her parents.

""Fearful Symmetry"" involves rare zoo animals being abducted and impregnated in a case which Mulder believes may be linked to alien conversation. ""Dod Kalm"" sees the agents stranded on a 'ghost ship' which is in an area of the sea which accelerates the ageing process of the victims on board at an alarming rate. Mulder and Scully must find a way to survive of the stranded ship through means of fresh water. Gillian Anderson is superb in this episode and deserved to win an Emmy. ""Humbug"" was the first humorous episode of the show and was a huge success, further proving that this is a unique show that can scare and absorb you, while making you laugh and cry. In ""The Calusari,"" the agents investigate a young boy possessed by evil while being exposed to the ancient ritual of exorcism. It's episodes that include evil and Satanic subjects that really, really scare me. I couldn't sleep after watching this episode! And the agents go behind closed doors to stop a grotesquely disfiguring virus that is killing off prison inmates at an epidemic rate in the episode ""F. Emasculata.""

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

Season Two of The X-Files is definitely a highlight of the entire show. Every episode is absolutely excellent, but all touch you and affect you in different ways. There are not many shows that can do this, but The X-Files pulls it off to maximum effect. Fairly confident that The X-Files was here to stay because of the huge success of Season One, Chris Carter put all his effort into Season Two of the show. After the show just went on to become a global phenomenon, Carter gained more ideas for Season Three. One thinks things can't get any better after Season Two, but they can. And they do.",1042243200,26,5478,4.809978768577495

Also because of Gillian Anderson's pregnancy during this series the writers brilliantly come up with the idea to have Scully abducted, which really sets out Scully's future for the rest of the show. When Scully is abducted we meet Mulder's new partner, Alex Krycek, who at first seems nice enough but later, can he be trusted? We also learn more about Mulder's past and the abduction of his sister, Samantha, which is what his entire quest is founded on.
Once again the extra's are great with episode trailers, (I loved those!) for every episode! Another interview with Chris Carter, and also deleted scenes.

2434491,5,B000BOH98G,"How does one begin to describe the perfection that is this second season of ""The X-Files?""  Speaking from the perspective of having watched these shows as they aired, anxiety and anticipation doesn't begin to describe the four month wait between seasons one and two.  In season one's finale ""The Erlenmeyer Flask,"" we see a mere glimpse of how this television series can go from greatness and kick it up even higher to absolutely stunning.  The X-Files are closed and we also lose ""Deep Throat"" in this episode, played by Jerry Harden who is an excellent actor.
Season two picks up with ""Little Green Men"" and the introduction to ""X,"" ""Deep Throat's"" protg and his replacement and Special Agent Fox Mulder's inside source.  We also get to start seeing the ""Mythology"" of the series start to take some real form.  To hide the fact that the ever beautiful Gillian Anderson is pregnant, the producers come up with some wonderful filming techniques.  Then to top it off they come up with the plot line for ""Duane Berry.""
Every episode of this season qualifies as amazing, enthralling, stunning and any number of ways to describe that which is great.  Some notables:  ""The Host,"" because it's just creepy and kind of like an accident, you don't want to look at it but you have to.  ""Sleepless"" because it has Tony Todd who, when he chooses the right parts, is such a wonderful actor.  ""Duane Berry,"" ""Ascension,"" ""3,"" and ""One Breath"" for the masterful way the writers and producers skillfully scripted out Gillian Anderson's pregnancy in Dana Scully's abduction.  Not to mention the wonderful job that Steve Railsback did in the role of Duane Berry.  ""Firewalker"" because of its simplicity and the scientific curiosity it created.  ""Aubrey"" because of its ability to surprise and scare you.  ""Die Hand Die Verletzt"" because it makes you wonder what your neighbors are up to.  ""Colony"" and ""Endgame"" for their X-Files mythology aspect, plus the scenes with the submarine were stunning.  ""Humbug"" was their first attempt at humor and they carried it off with perfection.  ""The Calusari,"" shades of ""The Exorcist.""  ""Soft Light"" in which Tony Shaloub gives an excellent performance playing a scientist that found a little more than he was looking for.  ""Our Town"" just gives you the idea you don't want to stop in the wrong town.  ""Anasazi,"" what a wonderful season ending cliffhanger with the mythology in full stride.  The only bad thing about ""Anasazi"" is that it was prelude to a four month wait to find out what happen next.  ""Colony"" is also David Duchovny's debut as a writer for the show.
The seventh disk also contains some wonderful and enlightening special features.  The only true minor complaint that I can think to register about this DVD set is the case in which it comes.  The outside cover has interior flaps that seem to incessantly get caught on the case that holds the disks.  Thanks for sticking it out and reading through this.

Very interesting conversation between Mulder and Melissa Scully and Mulder and Mrs. Scully. Great acting done by Duchovny.  Red speedo episode. Mulder feels tremendous guilt...a familiar theme as time goes on.), Humbug (funny Darin Morgan episode. Killer making rounds at a freak show. Many strange characters (including true circus performers) and many funny lines.), Anasazi (Cliffhanger. Mulder in his undies. Mulder in mental distress: physically attacking Skinner and yelling at Scully.), mytharc of Colony/End Game (start of the morphing alien and the cloning sister Samantha themes. Mulder trades his sister for Scully.  Mulder in distress. Scully warming up to Mulder.), Irresistible (serial killer/necrophiliac kidnaps Scully. Great interaction between M & S. Scully in distress.), Excelesius Dei (frustrated ghosts of retirement home go on a criminal rampage. Scully initiates the X-File.), Our Town (cannibal religious sect. Scully kidnapped...again. Mulder to the rescue.), Little Green Men (Senator Matheson (may have the wrong name here) makes an appearance.  Angsty Mulder does not really want to see the proof of alien life.  Check out Heidi's review of this episode on the Chimerical website (hilarious)), and Die Hand Die Verletzt (""toads just fell from the sky"" episode. Very weird episode.). Cons: 3 (No Scully, but Mulder finally gets some action.), Blood (I don't like the guy from Newhart), Dod Kalm (boring and bad makeup), F. Emasculata (gross pus popping postules!!!), and Fearful Symmetry (zoo animals abducted by aliens?...okay). Overall, a very good season. Duchovny and Anderson look so young. Duchovny is so thin and Anderson is not (she was preggers in the earlier half of this season and the last half of the prior season). I often wonder if Anderson was not pregnant during this season, then maybe Scully would have never been abducted (this season), never found out she was sterile (4th (by Mulder)/5th (by Scully) seasons), and never have got cancer (4th season).

With the first part of the two-parter ""Duane Barry"", the show finally gets its dramatic elements right. A turning point on the show, Mulder and Scully also found themselves in the midst of an elaborate government conspiracy involving UFOs and alien beings. This season charts the beginning of the mythology, the heart and strength of this show. Faced with all new baddies such as serial killers, vampires, flukes, witches, and cultists, Mulder and Scully really get their groove on as we become accustomed to The X-Files standard. The stories here are definitely darker than the first season. With such moving episodes as ""One Breath"", the show proves it can have drama and still keep its tone. Until then, there was nothing much happening in the drama department on the series. This season's story arcs are carried over in many seasons to come, including the ironic journey of Scully, who comes closer to the truth than Mulder ever has. This is the season where Scully gets abducted, and Mulder learns that he and his partner are on to something big, and this time he's not just being paranoid.

While not all of the episodes are great, enough of them are to ballance out the occasional dud(Fearful Symmetry, Aubrey, 3, Irresistable). It originally disturbed me to see the level of gore increase from Season 1(especially in episodes Aubrey and Fresh Bones), but it shouldn't bother you unless you are super sensetive(in which case, why are you watching the X-Files, silly? :p). The DVDs are of ok quality. To my surprise, these dvd's video quality is actually WORSE than the first season's, especially in the later episodes. Anasazi has the worst case of grain I believe I have ever seen. But, I give them a break, because it's a television show, after all, and not a big budget blockbuster movie. I have no quarrels with the sound, just don't be prepared to be blown away. The extras are slightly better than last time around aswell. The documentary is nearly doubled in length, we get 4 deleted scenes instead of 2, and we get 4 special effects shots. We also get the VHS interviews with series creater Chris Carter, which basicly only cover the basics of the episodes. I personally like the FX(channel that runs X-Files Repeats) segments, some of which are very interesting, but are only 1 minute long. The episode trailers are cool, but what's up with Anasazi's trailer coming from the syndication network? Where did it's original trailer go? Could they not find it? I know I remember seeing one. Finnally, I would like to commend Fox on improving the box design. The first season's was flimsy, and was scratched to bits by the time I got in the mail. The season 2 one is allot more durable,and shiny too. Finnally, the last extra is the foreign language clips. I don't know why these where included, because they are too short to help non-english speaking people, and have no value to the rest of us. I don't find it funny to listen to other languages, and I certainly hope that this was not why they were included, although I have a feeling that it is the reason. Overall, a good buy, especially if you are an X-Files fan, or even just a science fiction, or really if you just want some of the best material Television has ever given us.",1018915200,3,2295,4.586374695863747
2434499,5,B000BOH98G,"Really, there is nothing else like this show on TV. This is the season that really got me hooked. Scully's abduction around episode 5 (Duane Barry and Ascension) came as a great shock to me... but two episodes later I realized that this show was so much more than shocking storylines. One Breath came as poetry to my eyes. Its score (composed by Mark Snow) was so emotional and intimate. And then I started to realize how well they told stories. They didn't try to give us what we already expected, but they suprised us (going beyond our own expectations) by taking big risks. Red Museum is a perfect example of this wise use of storytelling and narrative techniques. Then there is the begining of the mithology with Scully's abduction, Samantha's return and the excelent cliffhanger in Anasazi. The best of this season includes (leaving the mithology aside): Irresistible (an insight into Scully and her guilts perfectly matching the story of a necrophilic fetichist), Dod Kalm (come on! the stars becoming old and the poetic myth around the end of act 4... this is just a winner), Humbug (the first and one of the most complex humoristic episodes of the series about looks and mirrors), F. Emasculata, Aubrey and Die Hand Die Verletzt.
This show works at so many levels that I was astonished. The metaphoric level being the richer of them all... anyone thinking The Sopranos or The West Wing are the top of the TV (a.k.a. EMMY voters) clearly haven't seen the metaphoric and eliptic level of The X-Files and just stop at the well known dramaturgic level (which to be honest is just a matter of mechanics, and behind that there is always something better to analyze).

2434502,5,B000BOH98G,"There's much to the X-Files that's hard to defend. Whole Web sites have been devoted to nitpicking the science. Attempts to fit the X-Files episodes into an entire Universe view creates conflicts between the earliest episodes and later ""mythology"" episodes.
But forget all of that. What makes The X-Files great are the personal strengths and flaws of Mulder and Scully and their relationship. As with so many popular shows, it is hard to reproduce the magic found here, because we don't really understand how the magic works. It's human chemistry, and its science is more myth than flying saucers.
To round out the picture of this special series, add some high quality photography, quirky support actors and beautiful externals. Of course, don't forget the often-inspired writing, including some very wry humor: Paraphrasing since I don't have my disks handy: ""He's a killer, and a golfer."" ""Hey, I think you drooled on me."" ""Can I get this off my hand without betraying my cool exterior."" And my favorite, from 3: ""You're really disturbing me...On multiple levels.""
I could go on, but why bother. Either you're a fan or your not. Not familiar with the show? Catch it on repeats and see what you think. All that said, if you are a fan, I can't recommend the DVD collections enough. I have seasons one and two, and I have seasons three and four on my list. I may go all the way to season 6 in the end.
Why spend all of the cash?
1) You get every episode, with great picture and sound. Honestly, this alone makes the sets worth having
2) You get the interviews with Chris Carter originally included with the videos. They're often full of behind the scenes info.
3) You get the spots created for the FX reruns, including brief interviews with the actors. One of my favorites, long time cult villain Brian Thompson who plays the alien bounty hunter and comes across as a very mellow, soft-spoken guy.
4) You get some deleted scenes as well.
What's missing on these? Well, it looks as though season four finally adds commentary for a couple episodes. This is sorely missing from seasons one and two. In fact, if you had the VHS copies already and caught the spots on FX, you don't get that much in the way of additional extras with one and two. And extras help make spending so much worth it. It's hard to have too many. For instance, there was no apparent direct star involvement with these sets, such as interviews with principle actors done just for these colections.
Still, those minor criticisms aside, I consider both DVD collections I own a great value. If you're a fan, you will too - especially when you're in the mood for an episode, and the World Series is on one channel, and repeats from season 8 on the other. Whip out an early one and relive the magic:

2434504,5,B000BOH98G,"I have to admit, I didn't start watching the X-Files until around season 4, actually the last half of it, and seeing the seasons coming out on DVD was a huge thing for me.  All the seasons are great, there are great episodes in each one and season 2 is no different.  The best episodes are:
Little Green Men: A mythology episode. Even get to see an alien!
The Host: Man worm, pretty cool.
Duane Berry, Ascension: The best episodes in my opinion of the entire season.  Deals with alien abduction and is a major mythology 2 parter.  Scully is abducted in these episodes.
Colony, End Game: My other favorites of the season. The Alien bounty hunter is just awesome. Mulder thinks he finds his sister. Major mythology two parter.
Irresistable: Very cool and somewhat scary episode of a demonic guy who abducts and kills women for their hair.
Anasazi: Season finale.  One of the best episodes of the entire show.
The DVD's could have had better special features, I want interviews with Duchovny and Anderson.  But all in all it is a great set.",1005004800,,1037,4.578378378378378

2434506,5,B000BOH98G,"Fox delivers another beautiful collector's edition on DVD.  Thankfully they have revamped the packaging and have given us a much more durable box set then season one.  In season two the show hits its stride and becomes a classic.  With the x-files closed Mulder is assigned a new partner in Alex Krycek while Scully is teaching at the academy.  X steps in for Deep Throat as Mulder's informant and Skinner becomes a major character in the series.  This season had it all, suspense, mystery, horror, and comedy.  Season two had some of the creepiest episodes ever like The Host, Aubrey and Irresistible.  My personal favorites were Duane Barry/Ascension, Colony/Endgame, Dod Kalm and One Breath.  We also get the first ever comedy episode in Humbug and a great season finale in Anasazi.  With over 20 hours of material this set is well worth the price even for just the casual fan.",995068800,6,880,4.8133333333333335
2434507,5,B000BOH98G,"The second season of the X-Files was when the show really began to find its feet (and its audience). David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were beginning to realise the show was taking on a life of its own and so were beginning to really put their heart into each performance. If not the best, then certainly the most intriguing and consistent season, it had some of the greatest episodes ever.
If you've never seen the X-Files and you want to find out what all the fuss is about then you would do better to start with season one and follow it all the way through - you would certainly get a lot more out of it that way. And if you are an x-phile, then you NEED this set. Any x-phile worth his/her salt will buy this set.
First, a note about the packaging for those who complained about the season one set being to flimsy and easy to ruin; this set has significantly improved packaging and is much sturdier. The artwork is great, and when you fold out the packaging to reveal seven glorious DVDs you can't help but drool. The price tag may seem steep to some people but remember there are 25 episodes over seven DVDs.
Like the S1 DVDs, the picture quality is not perfect; you have to remember, however, that this was filmed way back in 1994/95 on a modest budget so you can't expect crystal clarity.
Watching these episodes will bring a tear to the eye of any x-phile as it reminds us just how good the show once was before it slid into mediocrity somewhere around season 5/6. In my honest opinion it is still the best show on TV, but the episodes on this set are the cream of the crop. Episodes like ""Humbug"", the first comedy episode which was a true success and broadened the show's palette considerably, paving the way for brilliant episodes in later seasons; ""Anasazi"", which blew the show's 'mythology' wide open and was a masterfully created hour of television; ""Duane Barry"" and ""Ascension"", the two parter that rocked the X-Files' world and which has major significance 6 years later in the show's ongoing storyline; ""One Breath"", believed by many to be the show's greatest hour; the list goes on.  The extras are interesting to die-hard x-philes, but more casual viewers will probably not find anything of interest here. We will forgive Fox for this since DVDs were not around when this season was made so they wouldn't have known to keep any behind the scenes things for use on a DVD. Let's hope later seasons will come with better extras.
So, I cannot think of any reason why this DVD set should not receive a 5 star rating. Beautifully packaged, very reasonably priced (buying the same amount of episodes on VHS would cost you over $250 at full retail price!), good menus, and 25 of the greatest hours of TV ever made. There's no doubt in my mind that nothing will ever come close to revolutionising TV the way the X-Files did in the mid 90's. There's really no excuse to not own this set. You won't regret it.",992908800,7,2921,4.4906015037593985
2434508,4,B000BOH98G,"As an obsessed fan of ""The X-Files"", I thought the release of the first 2 seasons on DVD was a fantastic! Unfortunately, this collection suffers from the same faults of the first season. The quality is top-notch, with each episode cleaned nicely and offered in closed-captioning and  foreign languages. However, the second season set offers nothing new and different. It contains the spots with Chris Carter (which anyone who bought the video sets has already seen), the tv commercials and the FX spots. All of these are, of course, very nice. I only wish that the dvds contained more behind-the scenes action, alernate cuts and maybe even a few bloopers. Additionally, the set contains a pc cd-rom game, which is just great - if you own a pc. Mac users like myself are paying for this game and we can't even use it. Hopefully, I'm not missing too much. Over all, this is still a fantastic collection. I consider it a must have for any true X-Files fan. Hopefully, they'll continue to produce these sets, and maybe add a little more to them! If",991526400,3,1044,4.673913043478261
2434509,5,B000BOH98G,"For those who wish to understand the fan base behind the X-files season 2 is the perfect starting point.  The first season is not necessary (Although still excellent) to understand the second.  Season one establishes the partnership/friendship between Mulder and Scully but season two shows the bond that will hold them together for 6 more seasons.
  The episodes contained in this boxed set reveal to us some of the best acting/writing/production of any television show of the 90's.  Each show is like a mini movie.  It is also the beginning of one of the best (if not always well written later on) long running storylines in Television history.  We are introduced to some of the most annoying and despicable villains in any show too.
  There is an emmotional intensity displayed in season two that is rarely ever reached again on the X-files.  A prime example of this is the espisode entitled ""One Breath""  One of televisions finest hours in my opinion.  This season also has something for every suspense/thriller fan- from little green men to bloodsuckers to serial killers the show crosses every boundary with style and grace.
  The bonus features are not all that great but it is still worth the price for an entire season, not just a 'best of'.  For anyone who started to watch the show after season 5 and enjoyed the show I think they will love season 2.  See where it all really begins.  We can only hope seasons 4 and 5 are put on DVD.  After that it starts to get weak.",990921600,4,1479,4.644787644787645

So what exactly do I like about Season 2 on DVD?  Well, besides the fact that it contains EVERY SINGLE EPISODE in this neat, compact little box, its presentation is excellent.  Nothing too fancy, but very professional nonetheless.  It also contains deleted scenes and other nifty little extras that any true X-phile would cherish.  The first day I got this, my boyfriend and I had our own X-Files marathon.  It's really interesting to be able to go back and watch every episode in order, back to back, to observe the Mulder/Scully relationship develop into what it is today, and to watch the mythology web unfold all over again.  Also, I love being able to just put a disc in and skip to my favorite scenes (like the one where Mulder emerges from a swimming pool, dripping wet, wearing nothing but a skimpy little red Speedo).  I can't wait to own all 8 (plus?) seasons on DVD.  There's nothing to NOT like about this box set.",979516800,4,1177,4.669902912621359
2434515,4,B000BOH98G,"Most multi-disc sets are nicely packaged, and this one is no exception.  I won't bother reviewing the regular content, since you'd better already know if you like the episodes before you plunk down the big dough a set like this costs.
 The sound is great with a Dolby 5.1 setup, and the navigation arrangement is simple and not a distraction.  The only negative thing I can say, is that they way you access the deleted and the behind-the scenes is a little awkward:  Prior to viewing the episode, you have to go to Special Features and switch on the option, and then while watching the episode an X will appear in the lower right hand corner of the screen during spots where you can elect to switch to the deleted/behind-the scene.  Not ridiculous, but certainly counter-intuitive.
 As I experience more and more DVD's I am forced continually to wonder if the designers of these interfaces have ever actually asked a consumer what they want from ""extra features"", and how they want to use the DVD.  But this is a general rant, not a specific review...the extra features on the DVD's in this set are decent, and are certainly value-added.  They are not the best I've seen, but neither are they the worst.
 Was it worth it to me to get this set?  Absolutely.  Do I wish they'd consulted me before releasing it?  Heck yeah.  Maybe next time.",979084800,5,1338,4.594936708860759
2434516,5,B000BOH98G,"I have read some of the other reviews, and I agree with some of them and disagree with others of them. I have been a fan of the X-Files since I watched Pilot when the series premiered. I feel that the X-Files is a very good series, and that even people who are not fans of science fiction will enjoy it. My fiance has and is eagerly awaiting seasons 3 and beyond to be released. Some points that I would like to make are:
1. This season is presented in a full frame format, and some people have complained about it being P&S. This is not the case as the season was filmed in full frame, and it was not until season 5 or 6 (I can't remember exactly) that they didn't convert to filming in the 16:9 ratio that some are desiring.
2. The beginning of every episode states that they are available in Dolby Stereo, where available. Some are asking why they are not in Dolby Digital 5.1. The reason for this is that this was not even an option at this time. Sure, they could probably go back and convert it, but that would be based on someones interpretation of the way things should sound and would not truly recreate the original broadcasts of the episodes.
3. There have been two main improvements to the packaging of the season this time around. The DVD case is made of a reinforced cardboard rather than standard card stock this time around, and the DVD's are much easier to remove from their trays. Kudos to Fox on listening to the consumers desires on this. The only thing that I would like to see (other than offering replacements to those of us who own season one in a reinforced cardboard sleeve :P) is that they move from the sleeves to a slip case as in how boxed sets of books, other DVDs, and other videos are presented. Don't get me wrong, I still LOVE the multipaneled folder containing the DVDs, I just would like for them to have come in true slip cases.
Well enough for the points I want to make. The second season is a necessity for all true X-philes and their collections, I think that other companies should see how Fox is treating their fans to a real treat in being able to own an entire seasons on DVD in one set. The episodes here really build on the conspiracy arc, and we are introduced to notable new characters, and others are fleshed out a little more in this. These episodes are key to an understanding of some of the elements in the movie and later seasons.
I would highly recommend this to all X-fans, from the hardcore X-Phile to the most casual of fans. You won't be disappointed.",978739200,,2509,4.329087048832272
2434517,5,B000BOH98G,"Fox is doing an excellent job bringing us the X-Files on DVD. I like having a complete season in one box and not to buy every other episode separately (which is the case with Star Trek...).
Anyway, in the 2nd season, the X-Files really got going with the big arc story of the big conspiracy hiding the truth about aliens (which is also used in order to handle Gillian Andersons pregnancy at the start of the season, she gets abducted... nevertheless Gillian looks quite different before and after giving birth). This makes for the really good two-parters of the season  ""Duane Barry/ Ascension"", ""Colony / End Game"" and the cliff-hangar ""Anasazi"" (can't wait for Season 3!).
The extras on disc 7 are nice in itself, especially the commentaries by Chris Carter. Would have been nice if these were a little bit longer.

The extras are there, too! Behind the scenes, special effects. My only gripe is that nothing was really compiled especially for this DVD set - it was all taken from other areas. However, I am not really complaining.
Half of these wonderful eps are not available on VHS.
Even if you are a minor fan, sit down one weekend with this DVD set and you'll fall in love with the X Files all over again.

2434519,5,B000BOH98G,"Back a few months while browsing Amazon, I came across the first season of the X-Files.  Now, I've seen the movie, and I've seen a handful of X-Files episodes, but it was not something I ever regularly watched.  It was one of those situations where I wanted to get into it, but figured I was a few seasons too late to do so.  Also I gathered that the story has been ongoing for years, and I have probably missed out on a lot of story plot.
I figured, what the heck, I'll start with the first season and watch everything in order.  I plunked down the hundred or so dollars for the box set and began my journey into the X-Files.  I was pretty happy with the first season.  Nothing all that special, but enough to hold my interest.
This all changed when I saw the finally of season one.  After the episode was over, I ran to the box set, threw the 7th DVD disc in the drive only to realize there were no more episodes, and that was the season cliffhanger.  Needless to say, I was drooling for more.
Jumping ahead 6 months later, the second season was released and I rushed to order it.  Four days later, the second season box set somehow materialized onto my kitchen table.  I thought it may have been Aliens, or some secret government experiment, but my roommate reassured me that he answered the door to our regular (that's what he thinks) postman and he indeed put the DVDs on the table.
All I can say about season two is ""Amazing"".  There are so many episodes that left me sitting in my chair, jaw dropped open, and uttering ""wow"".  Sure, there are a few weak stories thrown in, but man...there's some real treats in this box set.  Sleepless, Duane Barry, Ascension, One Breath, Colony (Second Favorite X-File I've seen), End Game (First Favorite X-File I've seen) are all riveting.  Tonight I watch Humbug and hope to have the season finished by the weekend.
The quality of the DVDs overall is great.  There are a few ""bad audio moments"" but the picture is crisp and the box set itself is wonderfully put together.

2434520,5,B000BOH98G,"As an X-Files fan, not a fanatic, I'll defer criticism of the 25 episodes in this set to other, much better qualified reviewers below.  But you don't need to be a rabid fan of this series to appreciate the quality and thought that has obviously gone into the packaging of this product.
All 25 episodes and a bunch of extras come on seven discs.  The one-sided discs each feature unique artwork from one of the episodes they contain.  The discs nest in a very nifty container made of seven panels, one for each of the discs.  This *container* is over two feel long and folds in on itself.  Additionally, there's a pocket to hold a slim booklet which includes production information that only the aforementioned fanatics will care about.  Finally, there is a sleeve that fits over the folded package to keep it from unfurling.
The paper stock is luxurious and lavished with artwork and stills from the show.  All told, the entire set has dimensions approximating three stacked DVD cases.  Contrast this to Paramount's bumbling release of a mere 79 episodes of the original Star Trek on FORTY separate discs.
All the hay that's been made about viewing movies on DVD is completely deserved, but the format's service to television has yet to be fully appreciated.  For starters, the picture quality is much better than broadcast or even cable.  Watching a season's worth of episodes in rapid sequence will give you a new appreciation for the subtle changes in Mulder and Scully's characters and at least a fighting chance at understanding the series' underlying ""mythology"" story arc.

2434522,4,B000BOH98G,"Season 2, of course, is one of the more interesting seasons of The X-Files. In my opinion, Season 2 is slightly inferior to Seasons 3 and 1, but is still excellent overall. The foundation of the mythology arc is set forth in this season, and we get to know Cancer Man a little better as other characters like Krycek and X are introduced. This set gives you classic episodes like ""Little Green Men,"" ""Colony/EndGame,"" and ""Anasazi.""
The folks who put The X-Files box sets together are just brilliant. Laid out in a compact and sturdy ""book"" that folds out, the packaging is sexy: all dark and metallic looking. While I wish there were MORE extras, the ones that are there are quite nice. For instance, you get some ""Behind the Truth"" promos from F/X, all of the Fox TV episode trailers (almost 50 of em!), some deleted scenes, some alternate language showcases, a short original documentary with Chris Carter, and some special effects clips.

Like the first season, we get 7 DVD's with 4 episodes each and a DVD with extras. The way they package their X-Files collections should make other companies think twice on how they release episodes of their series. The second season of X-Files continues many of the ongoing story lines of the first season and really starts to get into the conspiracy story arc. The second season also shows how brave Chris Carter is. While it is still science fiction, episodes like 'The Host' start pushing the limits of what kinds of violence they can show on TV. If you are squeamish, I would avoid that episode. But, the most important series of episodes on the third reason is the Duane Berry story arc. It carries a story about alien abduction over a 4 (really 3, but one has an impact of the 3) episode span. It really kept fans hanging on. As an X-Files newbie, I can't say which season is the best, but the second season is strong.

Same layout as the first one, but this time it comes in a reinforced cardboard box (it's very sturdy unlike the first one that came out in May).  The picture quality is outstanding, and you do not get gypped out of any episode, like the VHS Wave Packs, because we all know our favorite episodes vary.  If you've never seen the season before (or seen it out of order like I ended up doing), you can watch it all in chronology.
*MINOR SPOILER AHEAD*
My favorite episodes are the 3 episodes where Scully went AWOL: ""Duane Barry/Ascension/One Breath""  Very suspenseful, and even though you know she comes back, it seems like she won't.  Great episodes!  Also, ""Firewalker"" is one freaky and scary episode (I can distinctly remember seeing this episode as a passive watcher when I was only 9 yrs. old in 1994...it scared the hell out of me!)...kind of reminds me of ""Ice"" in the first season, only with a very different organism.  *END SPOILER*
This also sounds great with surround sound, even though it is only in 2 channels.  Also, the extra features are worth checking out, too.

2434527,5,B000BOH98G,"First of all, hats off to CBS/FOX for giving X-Philes a real value.  It would be tempting to release the X-Files episodes two or three at a time as Paramount has done with the original Star Trek. Or even to just release a ""best of"" collection as they've done with the video releases of X-Files (which while it gives you the classic mythology episodes, sometimes it overlooks some some of my personal favorites).  Instead, FOX has given us the box set that includes every episode of season two, plus a few extra goodies.
The second season of the X-Files was when it really took off, becoming not only a solid hit for FOX, but also a critical darling and a pop culture phenomenon.  It was the first season to be nominated for an Emmy for best drama and it certainly shows in the episodes represented here. Season two is the one that had the best balance of monster of the week and mythology episodes.  The monsters of the week were memorable and scary--from the disguisting flukeman to the horrifying Donnie Phaster and many more.  There were also the mythology episodes such as the six-story arc to open the season and the classic Colony/End Game episodes that introduced us to Mulder's family.  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are both superb over the course of the season and they continue to get better and better with each episode. The second season also introduces perhaps one of the greatest X-Files writers of all time--Darin Morgan. His two episodes here are interesting--one is great (Blood) and the other is superb (Humbug).  Season two had it all and it's worth a look on DVD.
As for some of the detractors to this set, I must point out that only the past three seasons of X-Files have been shown in both widescreen and the full screen version.  Rumor is FOX plans to release the widescreen versions when we get to those seasons. Also, the Dolby surround sound wasn't used until season three, hence why FOX may have chosen not to include it here.
If you're an X-Phile, this is a must have.  If you're looking for a good place to start your journey into the X-Files and remember how good it was, this is the collection for you.

2434528,3,B000BOH98G,"These DVDs are great in that we can now own on DVD all of the original episodes from all of the seasons.  Having said that, when X-Files is shown on TV, it says: ""presented in Dolby Surround"" at the beginning of each episode.  Any dolby surround track is nowhere to be found on these DVD's.  Why is that?  Also, where is the widescreen presentation that the episodes are filmed in?  These episodes we get on DVD are pan and scan...Fox should re-release these box sets as widescreen verions with the proper surround sound.",975715200,2,521,4.559139784946237
2434529,5,B000BOH98G,"This is obviously a must-have for any X-Files fanatic... classic episodes will keep you on the edge of your seat, and all the gorgeous gloom has been perfectly captured in this set.  Other reviews here have gone into good enough detail that it'd just be redundant to repeat descriptions of each.  I will, however, list some of my personal favorites in this set:  ""One Breath"", ""The Calusari"", ""Little Green Men"" and ""Dod Kalm"" - in that order.  There are really too many great episodes to name, especially those dealing with the mythology, but those are the ones I remember and love the best from this season.
If the quality of this set and the previous one are indicative of what the future ones will be like, I'll definitely be purchasing the entire series.  I've never seen the episodes look more sharp and crisp (even when watching a first broadcast) and the extras are lots of fun!
Chances are that if you're reading this review, you're probably a die-hard fan like myself.  My only suggestion would be to preorder if you know you're absolutely going to get these collections anyway, because you'll save a pretty sizeable amount of cash.  I plan to preorder all of them, because I know I must own them ALL!  ;)",975628800,3,1215,4.644859813084112

8090257,5,B000BOH98G,"I remember waiting to see the episodes each week when i was young. Re watching this series is not only nostalgic it is also an experiment in memory.
I love how the Duchovney character is prob the most into his role in this season. I love the structure of this season in that you do not see much of scully for the first 8 or so episodes and it seems like the focus shifts in a good way. The season is kept slightly dull (again not in a bad way) up until around episode 10 then it goes into hyperdrive and some of the best episodes ever start emerging.
I am not a fan of television but make an exception to this series. I also enjoyed true detective. Some of the standout episodes that happen toward the middle of the season involve teachers in a cult as well as a creature that lives in the sewer and looks like the creature from the black lagoon. I usually watch mainly art films but i really enjoy this series and hardly remember any of the episodes from 20 + years ago.",1521763200,,971,4.142857142857143

The original The X-Files (1993-2002) has some brilliant episodes. I love the sci-fi alien and UFO episodes, but I decided to give the show four stars. The numerous shaky flashlight scenes get tedious after a while. There are way too many scenes of flashlights waving around in dark rooms and pointing at the camera. The other reason is the same problem I have with all the Twilight Zones and Outer Limits and X-Files shows and that is that the episodes are hit and miss. If you're a science fiction fan who doesnt appreciate horror you have to wade through a lot of horror episodes to get to the stuff you love, and often the series are incorrectly labeled by information sources. The X-Files is more of a horror and freak show than anything else, but the first genre label listed on Wikipedia for the show is sci-fi. Ive learned to read more about a show than just looking at genre labels, which I often don't agree with.

For example, the original The Outer Limits is labeled as fantasy, horror and sci-fi on IMDb. The second The Outer Limits (1995-2002) is labeled as drama, fantasy, and horror on IMDb, with no mention of science fiction. Most of The Outer Limits (1995-2002) episodes are horror, but The Light Brigade (1996) episode is an example of outstanding sci-fi, but its incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror on IMDb instead of sci-fi. Quality of Mercy (1995) is another example of a great sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror. Star Crossed (1999) is a third example of a sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror by IMDb. Wikipedia is usually a better source of genre information when looking at shows.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,3192,5.250980392156863
