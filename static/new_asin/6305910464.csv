1089495,4,6305910464,"REVIEWED ITEM: Star Trek Original Series DVD Volume 13: This Side of Paradise / The Devil In The Dark
THIS SIDE OF PARADISE PRELIMINARY BRIEFS:
Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: ""Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than what he is""- Captain Kirk
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember (`Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: None
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: All I can say is, it's about time Spock be mackin' the-mad hottie-of-the-week instead of the charming Captain Kirk! Especially entertaining is the setup to this little romantic romp: the official Star Trek love theme starts up, followed by alternating reaction shots of guest-star Jill Ireland (as the crush-ridden Leila Kalomi) and Mr. Spock as they stare at each other in ""that way""! Well, actually she stares in ""that way""; Spock looks a bit confused by it all. But don't worry, he'll come around! A nice touch to this initial scene is the gentle glowing aura surrounding the love-struck lady! Kudos to the show's lighting department for getting this effect just right!
The real fun begins when Spock cops a whiff of some intoxicating flower spores, which cause him to become a way-too-cheerful ball of sickly-sweet happiness who is now deeply in love with Charles Bronson's future wife. He also acquires a penchant for literally hanging out on tree limbs like he was some kinda monkey! Ironically, for a man who's no longer afraid to show his emotions, Nimoy didn't put much feeling into his character's dialogue here. Fortunately, Jimmers finds out how to relieve Spock's (and subsequently everyone else exposed to the spores, including the entire ship's crew) newfound dorkiness by making insulting remarks to his face regarding his mom and dad, with a few racial slurs thrown in for good measure! But before Jimmers can bring the Spockster around, he has to snap outta his own little trip to La-La-Land. He manages this with his angered utterance of  ""I... Can't... LEAVE!"", spoken in that distinctive manner that has become a staple of many a second-rate standup act! Adding to this scene's funkiness, our beloved captain's face is illuminated in a spooky quasi-fluorescent, light-blue hue! Needless to say, the dramatic lighting department was in rare form for this eppie!
Another memorable lowlight to goof on here: Dr. McCoy breaking into a way-too-overdone Deep South accent after his exposure to the happy-spores. I am aware that DeForest Kelley hails from Georgia, but never the less his character's drawl was a bit too much, even for a native southerner! Adding to the overdone good-ol'-boy charm is his concoction of a mint julep! Sheesh, why doesn't he just break out the grits and pickled pigs' feet while he's at it!
THE DEVIL IN THE DARK PRELIMINARY BRIEFS:
Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: Don't mess with Mom!
Historical Milestone: Spock's first mind-meld with a non-humanoid life form
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember (`Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: 1 Dead, 3 Incapacitated
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: `Devil' features one of the most entertaining cheeseball moments in Star Trek history: Spock's mind-meld with the rock-creature-thingy! His anguished utterances of pain and sorrow are very similar to Counselor Troi's little trances whenever she uses her empathic abilities to check out the entity-of-the-week's emotional state on NextGen. Speakin' of emotional states, am I the only person who gets a hankerin' for meat loaf (no, not the singer, silly!) whenever I grab a glimpse of the creature-thingy? I can't be the only one...
Another especially goofy scene-well, several scenes, actually-- are the reaction shots of the doomed miners and/or red-shirts right before they get toasted by the vengeful creature. Most of `em seem to have enough time to get off a phaser shot or two before they start to feel the burn, but instead they spend their last two seconds of life all petrified and screaming like the total sissies they are (were?)! These amusing moments reminded me of the death-by-steam-roller scene in `Austin Powers'! Actually, a better parallel would be the death of Darth Maul in `Star Wars Episode I'! In any case, it appears the average human's reflexes in the face of certain doom ain't gonna improve all that much in the next three hundred years...

1089496,4,6305910464,"Both these episodes do a stellar job of spotlighting Leonard Nimoy at his best, and Shatner and DeForest Kelley do pretty well in them too.
""This Side of Paradise"" finds Spock possessed by alien spores, which  -  as they have for the human settlers of Omicron Ceti III  -  give him immortality and a remarkably sunny disposition.  As he and the rest of the Enterprise crew succumb to the spores, they lose all ambition and seek nothing more than to become happy stargazers lolling in the fields.  Kirk, of course  -  the ultimate Type A personality  -  will have none of that, and has to snap his wayward crew out of their lollygagging by inducing violent emotions in them to kill the symbiotically parasitical spores.  And that starts with getting Spock really, really mad...
Nicely produced, clever story.  Nimoy is great, playing against his usual strait-laced character as the laughing, lovesick fool, with the beautiful and charming Jill Ireland.  DeForest Kelley gets to put on his natural, down-home Southern drawl, and jus' be a good ol' boy for a while.  The confrontation between Kirk and Spock is terrific, and Spock's painful transformation brought on by the spores is very well-handled.
""Devil in the Dark"" is not as great as most people seem to think it is, its script actually pretty derivative and trite.  It is, however, excellently produced and acted, with believable sets and matte shots suggesting a massive, underground mining complex, and great performances from Shatner and (especially) Nimoy.  Nimoy had great emotional range and rarely got to show it, but he makes up for it in spades here by mind-melding with a highly lethal alien being that turns out to be more sinned against than sinning.",1028419200,,1718,4.913194444444445
1089497,5,6305910464,"Volume 13 of The Star Trek TOS DVD series has two of the first seasons most interesting episodes.  Although I agree that Spock should have been on the cover instead of Scotty for both episodes include classic moments with the Vulcan Science officer.  This DVD finds Leonard Nimoy exploring Spock's character somewhat.
The first episode here is THIS SIDE OF PARADISE.  I have always found that this episode took a jab at the drug culture of the 1960's but I don't know if anyone agrees with me.  The crew beam down to Omicron Ceti III expecting to find a bunch of dead colonists killed by a deadly radiation however instead they find a healthy happy colony.  However it is later found out that a native exotic plant with drug like spores has effected the colony protecting them from the radiation but preventing them from making any progress in the colony.  Soon the spores begin to affect the entire crew of the Enterprise and everybody abandons Kirk and the ship to live on the paradise including Spock.  The episode is a standard Trek outing but it should be noted for Spock bagging the babe for once and of course showing emotions.  The only thing that confuses me is why McCoy begins to speak in a ridiculous Southern accent when he is drugged?  Silly if you ask me!
The other episode here is THE DEVIL IN THE DARK which is one of Trek's finest episodes in the first season and of course Shatner's personal fave.  Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to mining colony of Janus V after a report monster has been killing 50 miners!  It turns out the Monster is actually a silicon based lifeform known as a Horta.  The creature is the last of it's kind and highly intelligent.  It has laid thousands of bizarre looking eggs and is protecting them from the miners who had invaded on it's nest.  In a strange way this episode tackles the racial issues of the sixties.  Still this episode is a classic partly because of Spock's mind meld with the Horta creature which is priceless acting.  Sure the Horta may look cheesy but the episode itself is great!
Overall Volume 13 is a must one classic and one standard but both memorable episodes from the original series.  Take a close look at Spock in these episodes it really developes his character.  Highly recommended!",1026950400,2,2259,4.5910224438902745
1089498,4,6305910464,"This is the first (and so far only) set of episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series that I've purchased.  One of the main reasons is that so few of the sets contain more than one good episode.  The highly erratic quality of the show and the (correct) decision to release the episodes in the exact order that they aired often means that one has to pick up a dud to get a favorite.
Fortunately, the two episodes on this disk are real gems.  The first, ""This Side of Paradise"" is a great ""Spock"" episode, letting the viewer get to know the coldly logical Vulcan and explore his past.  The second episode, ""The Devil in the Dark"" is a well-done sci-fi monster story.
Sadly, little is done to take advantage of the DVD format.  There are no commentaries and only minimal extras in the form of trailers for the episodes.  I hope Paramount does a better job when they release the DVD's for Star Trek: The Next Generation.",1003881600,12,916,4.4226190476190474
1089499,5,6305910464,"Volume 13 of Paramount's complete Star Trek reissue contains two episodes long popular with fans.
This Side of Paradise is known primarily as the episode where Spock falls in love.  This sensitive story was written by D. C. Fontana, who wrote many of the series' best scripts.  Spock had been mostly asexual since the beginning of the series, but when Leonard Nimoy began to receive large quantities of fan mail, the writers decided to come up with a romance for Spock.  This episode allows Nimoy to stretch his acting muscles and prove he can do more than merely raise his eyebrow.  Seeing Spock come under the influence of the alien spores (""I love you.  I can love you."") and finally escape his self-imposed purgatory of logic is akin to watching a butterfly escape from its cocoon.  The scene with Kirk alone on the abandoned bridge is a searing portrait of the loneliness of command, excellently acted by Shatner.
William Shatner has referred to The Devil in The Dark as his favorite episode.  It's easy to see why: the story, dealing with the crew encountering a new life form which makes the crew reconsider their actions, summarizes everything that Star Trek is about.  The timelessness of the story makes it possible to overlook the rather dated Horta costume.  This episode was also close to Shatner's heart for a very different reason: while filming the Horta mind-meld scene with Leonard Nimoy, he was notified that his father had passed away.  Ever the professional, and knowing that he would not be able to catch a flight for several hours, Shatner refused to abandon that day's filming--although the scene remained unfinished until he returned from his father's funeral.  Nimoy remained at his side for the remainder of the day, which cemented their relatively new friendship.  Fortunately, there are no continuity problems resulting from the break in filming.  In a reversal of the norm, Shatner underplays his performance during Spock's agonizing mild-meld with the Horta, allowing Nimoy to shine.
The picture has never looked better, with great colors and flesh tones, particularly in the outdoor scenes.  The sound has been remastered in multichannel stereo.",994032000,11,2177,5.027855153203342
1089500,4,6305910464,"Two classic episdoes on this DVD, filled with some of the really tough questions. What is paradise? What is considered to be alive? There are just some of the questions which this DVD raises.
In ""This Side of  Paradise"", The Enterprise crew becomes infected with a mind altering  ""spore"" which transforms them into an ideal state of mind. The  parallel to me from the late 70's is clear: the spores are a metaphor for  drugs. The statement being that spores (drugs) might put you in an ideal  ""place"", but without need nor want, there is no reason to exist.
In ""The Devil in the Dark"", a silicon-based lifeform attackes  miners because her eggs were being destroyed. The classic ""care for  our earth"" motto and ""respect all forms of life"" themes are  definately being presented.
That's the best part of Star Trek. It has  its morals, it has its really tough questions. But it was disguised in a  way that it was still ""entertaining"". Best of all, both of these  episdoes make you think!
The quality of both the sound and the picture  are excellent, and of very high quality.
Overall, a great buy!",963360000,9,1096,4.6217616580310885
1089501,4,6305910464,"The first Spock kiss.
During Star Trek's first season, female horomones raged for Leonard Nimoy's stoic portrayal of Spock.  Writers debated on how to give fans their wish of a ""romantic"" Spock  story.  ""This side of Paradise"" was the result.  The Enterprise  arives on a colony planet with plants that shoot spores that  ""relax"" an individual, Spock gets hit and falls in love.  The  series would try Spock love stories later, but the first was the best ans  most belivable.  A must have.",960854400,8,489,4.783132530120482

Episode 25: This Side of Paradise
 Star Date; 3417.5
  Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sulu beam down to Omicron Ceti 3. It is a paradise on the surface. They meet Elias Sandoval (Frank Overton) and Spock sees a woman, Leila (Jill Ireland), he knew years ago. An orchid sprays out confetti on Spock and he suddenly feels happiness, peace and serenity. Soon, the whole crew of the Enterprise is effected by the orchid spores with horrible after-effects.

Episode 26: Devil in the Dark
  Kirk (William Shatner) beams down to Janus IV to investigate a rock-like monster that is killing the men in the tunnels. It is able to go through any metal like hot acid.

  May look like a silly episode now, but when we were youngsters, we loved it.

Note: During the filming of this episode, William Shatner was told that his father had died. Shatner wanted to continue filming that afternoon. Their is a scene where Leonard Nimoy is standing close to Shatner concerned about his friend. They finally convinced Shatner to leave the studio and do what he needed to do.  Shatner left on a Friday and returned the following Monday to continue the scene. All of it was aired.

  Also in the cast: DeForest Kelly, Ken Lynch, James Doohan, Barry Russo.

7897809,4,6305910464,"Overall, these are not 2 of the stronger eps from Season 1 however they do allow for telling insights into the characters of both Spock and Kirk.  In the first, weaker ep, strange spores on an otherwise inhospitable planet allows settlers to survive in blissful existence without any ill effects from deadly radiation that is constantly bombarding the planet; in fact, even preexisting medical conditions are righted giving the inhabitants perfect health.  Now as you can expect, Kirk has to spoil things and 'rescue' the settlers from their brand of Eden.  The plot is rather weak as we are never told why Kirk isn't affected to the degree of the others to the effects of the spores or how easily he is able to counter the effects but we do get to see a softer, 'human' side of Spock as he actually admits loving someone here and you can feel his regret at having to leave this moment behind at the end.

The stronger second ep has a strong moral encouraging communication rather than revenge and retribution to settle differences.  Spock again gets to emote as he mind melds with the alien which is the subject of persecution as miners of a mineral-laden planet misunderstand the reasons behind the creature's animosity towards them.  A great advertisement for diplomacy over brute force if you can get over the low tech special effects.

If you are picking and choosing which volumes to collect and keep, put this under the ""good to have"" category, the others being: ""must have"" and ""give it a miss"".",1156636800,,1503,4.735632183908046
