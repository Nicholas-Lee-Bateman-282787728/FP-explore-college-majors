2594823,4,B000FZETS4,"The second season of KidsWB's new The Batman series is much improved over the first season. The show seems more confident of its identity now, and knows how to deliver exciting, fun, stories with less emphasis on outright pandering to the kiddie demographic. Notable episodes include the introduction of the Riddler, Hugo Strange, and a new take on the Solomon Grundy legend. Patrick Warburton makes a fun guest appearance as Yin's new partner, and Joker even dons the cape and cowl to fight crime for an episode. Ragdoll and Spellbinder's appearances make best use of the show's visual energy, and the season finale marks the introduction of a classic Batman supporting character and the setup for season 3. Best of all, there is a dramatic Clayface story that really makes viewers feel for this tragic villain in the vein of the old B:TAS series.

Among other fixes: The new Joker finally comes into his own, and Alfred ditches his nagging, season 1 attitude. Yin has more to do as Batman's partner, and the overall acting is much better from everyone. Penguin and Freeze still do nothing for me, but even they seem slightly improved from their season 1 offerings.

Season 2 of The Batman works for me. It's still not a deep show, but there's finally enough right here that I can enjoy the episodes without constantly making the B:TAS comparisons. Try this set, and you might find yourself having fun too. Recommended.",1150934400,32,1420,4.839506172839506

2594856,3,B000FZETS4,"The Batman--The Complete Second Season continues the bad drawing and irritating music of the first season but has a few interesting episodes. These are some of the noteworthy episodes:
The Cat, The Bat, and The Ugly. Catwoman and The Penguin team up to steal some Egyptian busts. But Penguin manages to get Batman and Catwoman chained together, so Batman & Catwoman work together to get the key and bust the Penguin. Penguin uses the busts to ignite a light ray which he threaten Gotham City for ransom. Batman & Catwoman defeat Penguin, and Batman manages to get Penguin & Catwoman chained together.
Strange Minds. Joker takes Detective Yin hostage. Joker is captured and refuses to tell where Yin is. Batman must use a device created by Hugo Strange to enter The Joker's mind in search of an answer. Yin is trapped in jack in the box dressed as a harlequin. Both Strange and Batman journey through The Joker's mind. Batman finds the last sane image of The Joker -- a bureaucrat in a filing room. Batman uses a double mind game and disguises to get The Joker to reveal where Yin is.
Ragdolls to Riches. Catwoman attempts to steal an animation cell of a cat from the 1920s, but Ragdoll shows up and steals it, despite Batman also being in the museum. Later Selina goes to a charity ball and gets romantically involved with Bruce, and goes to dinner with him. Ragdoll shows up and steals a twisty statue in front of Bruce and Selina. Bruce advertises the cat's eyes emerals hidden in an old clock tower and invites Catwoman and Ragdoll to steal them. Long fight among the gears of the clock tower, with Catwoman helping Batman defeat Ragdoll. Batman manages to get the emeralds back from Catwoman and later he sells them, giving the check to Selina.
Fire and Ice. Firefly and Mr Freeze team up to freeze out Gotham City by adapting the city's central furnace to freeze. First he freezes the police ball where Wayne is hosting. Batman investigates and he captures both Freeze and Firefly, by getting them to fight each other. Bruce gets frozen as well, but he has a failsafe in the Batcomputer that saves him.
 The Butler Did It. Spellbinder uses powerful hypnotism to force three butlers to steal from their emplyers. Alfred first steals a vase, then money in a safe from Brace. Batman follows him and fights Spellbinder. Batman encounters powerful illusions several times that he has to overcome, one in a very surreal spaceship.
The Laughing Bat. This is mainly noteworthy for well The Joker fights Batman. Batman suffers from a venom he got from The Joker. The Joker spends much time impersonating Batman.
Grundy's Night. A Halloween episode. Notable for sight gags of people dressed as Catwoman, The Joker, and The Penguin calling at Wayne Manor. Late in the episode a boy dressed as Batman comes to a house where the Real Batman and Clayface are fighting. This is a Clayface episode, where he pretends to be Solomon Grundy and scare people.
Episodes also feature The Riddler, Killer Croc, and a few others. Still the series has bad drawing that is difficult to ignore even when there is an occasional good script.",1404432000,,3117,4.729779411764706

2594914,4,B000FZETS4,"(Continued from my review on The Batman - The Complete Season One)

After a phenomenally written finish to Season One, this series really started to hit its stride in this season. We're introduced to their sinister take on The Riddler, and a great interpretation of Killer Croc, a la ""Splicers"" (a Batman Beyond episode). We're (finally) introduced to one of Batman's greatest allies, also. Since my review on the first season would've been rather lengthy, I'd also like to cover a couple of missed things on that one here; they're relevant to the whole series, anyway.

The Joker. Those two words conjure up many different things for different fans. Whatever Batman represents, whatever he stands for, The Joker is the chaotic storm in that that refuses to die down. There are so many interpretations to compare to, the all too obvious Mark Hamill is the first to spring to mind since this review is on another animated series. Veteran voice actor, Kevin Michael Richardson has the honor here. His performance could be described as heavily influenced by Hamill's portrayal, but KMR certainly performs The Joker different in a way that works for this version. I, for one, like the character model, again working very well in the setting. He is, and rightfully so, the most seen villain throughout this season and the series. I'm not a big fan of The Penguin, in general, but I like this version's surprising, though a tad comical, amount of mobility, making him a bit more formidable opponent. You see him quite a lot here and throughout, as well.

Overall, this second season continues a level of quality that was established in the first season, though you can tell cast and crew were more comfortable with each other, and it shows in the writing, direction, and acting. Because continuity was evidently important to all involved, you can't very well watch the first season without seeing where things were going in Season Two.",1330473600,,1929,4.892966360856269
2594915,5,B000FZETS4,I really enjoyed watching The Batman Second Season. Every episode has a very good story line. The Joker is a tough enemy for The Batman to deal with. I have not let my children watch it yet because I am having too much fun watching it over and over again.,1330214400,,255,4.12
2594916,4,B000FZETS4,"My kids started watching the original 1966 batman movie and then became obsessed.  I bought this disk set because it was longer than the other cartoon movies that you can purchase.  I think that the villains are little too scary looking for my 3 and 6 year old, I find the jokers red eyes to be pretty creepy.
I also bought Batman - Mask of the Phantasm, I prefer that movie and its animation over this one, but when it comes to quantity, you do get more bang for your buck with these episodes.  I got these episodes for a litle less than $10, which is a GREAT price, so I will have to give this 4 stars for that price, but if it was around the $15-$20 price range I would have given it 3 stars.",1327276800,,695,4.0583941605839415
2594917,5,B000FZETS4,This order took A very long time to get I got two more orders before it I love the show everything worked like I said it just took along time,1325808000,,141,3.7333333333333334

2594919,4,B000FZETS4,"If I would have done more research before buying I probably would have know that this is not the ""old"" batman cartoon series. For that I was pretty disappointed but my 3 and 4 yr old boys still love it and that's what matters. It has better writing in comparison to the new Spiderman cartoons (""The Spectacular Spiderman). So that is a definite plus to me because it has a lot less of the cheese factor. I thought it was pretty cool too that I was able to buy the first and second season separately for just 30 bucks.",1293494400,,517,4.232323232323233
2594920,4,B000FZETS4,"The second year of this series was a step in the right direction in some ways. But in others...

Animation wise, its still as great as the first season but one thing I forgot to mention last time. The sky in Gotham is on some kind of drug because its not the same color for two consecutive episodes, let alone within one. First its green, then purple, then red. I know in the fourth volume of Batman: TAS, the sky was red but it at least remained one consistent color. And when a character or building is set against the sky, it looks rather bland since there no clouds, reminding me of how cheap the third season of the Adam West series had been (cardboard cutouts in front of a stark black backdrop). But when there's a storm going on, the sky looks black, cloudy and relatively normal. The designs of the new villains are great, especially Killer Croc, who never seemed as menacing, to me anyway, in the original series. Lesser known villain Spellbinder, who was a villain in Batman Beyond, gets a great upgrade. From a rather silly, orange suited suit to a three eyed mystic. Like Joker, I was a off-put by the Riddler's new look, bringing singer Marilyn Manson to mind. The guy's so thin, he shouldn't be able to lift his cane. But, like the Clown Prince of Crime, the Prince of Puzzlers' look grew on me.

Again the voices are good and even Gina Gershon improves, though she was only good for one out of her two appearances this season. Steve Harris again gets a moment to shine in Meltdown, the sequel episode to last season's finale. How he changes from wanting revenge to embracing his criminal identity is moving (for this show anyway). While John Glover will probably remain my favorite voice of Riddler, Robert Englund (who everyone pretty much knows) was a great find, making the villain sound intelligent and cruel, even when spouting one of the show's trademark, eye-rolling puns. Ron Perlman (Clayface from B: TAS) does a great job with Killer Croc, infusing him with a Cajun accent and a sense of menace and intelligence that never felt captured in the original series. In that series, other than two episodes (not counting the one with Batman disguised as Croc), he became just a stupid, comic relief villain. Another 1960s Batman star, Frank Gorshin (the Riddler), voices Prof. Hugo Strange in one of his last roles before his death (which is unfortunate since Strange became one of the better villains on this show). One person who increasingly grew on my nerves was Jesse Corti's Chief Rojas. It's really more the writers' fault than the actor, but the character is never remotely likeable. All he does is yell at his force for the things they don't do instead of actually helping them find and trap the Batman.

Another thing I stupidly left out of my season 1 review was the music. My God is it bland. Even the opening theme is boring. I guess after the nineties ended, original music for cartoons (other than the DCAU) ended as well. It's all so unoriginal that its grating to hear the synth soundtrack. The only bit of music I do like is the Joker's leitmotif whenever he's around. It's quirkiness suits the character to a T.

The writers, who all seemed like hacks in season 1, really stepped up to make this season an improvement, though the season opener felt like it was written for a different hero/villain (actually it seemed like something Ra's al Ghul might've done though the Batman Returns feel of the three main characters helped a bit). The one thing the writers never really learned to do in the entire run of the show was balance the appearances of the villains. In these thirteen episodes alone, Joker appeared five times while Penguin has shown up four (and two of them featured Joker). While popular villains in their own right, the two were overexposed to the point that nobody ever really wanted to see them. While Joker's backstory will always remain a mystery and Penguin's backstory explained in his first appearance, no other villain received any amount of background (other than Clayface last season and Riddler in season 4). Heck, Catwoman and Riddler both got two episodes this season but nothing was really done with them. The theme of this season seemed to be that of partnerships. While Batman and Det. Ellen Yin formed theirs last season, the villains were teaming up out of the woodworks; from the slave-like partnership of Penguin and Man-Bat to the unlikely pairing of Mr. Freeze and Firefly (just go with it, that's what I did). Episodes that I liked include Riddled (Riddler's first appearance), Swamped (Killer Croc's first appearance along with the start of Batman's trophy room), Meltdown (wherein Ethan Bennett becomes a villain), The Butler Did It (where Alfred's intelligence is finally shown), Grundy's Night (just a fun Halloween episode) and Night and the City (where Batman faces the threat of Joker, Penguin and Riddler).

Season two was great though a few episodes were not up to standard.",1285545600,,4961,4.737268518518518
2594921,5,B000FZETS4,"I wish they didn't end this series in 5 seasons. I used to think that Japanese animation was the only good animation. I now admit that I'm wrong. This series is entertaining, better than ""Batman: The Animated Series"", & keeps you wanting more after every episode. If I remember correctly, they even do some flashback episodes of Batgirl & Robin. They also do (one of my favorites), an episode of Batman in the future. Those episodes I just mentioned are some of the gems of this series.

Most definitely this series is geared toward the younger crowd, but it also applies to the early adult audience (I'm in my 30's & enjoy it). Each season is reasonably priced (around $10.00 each @ this time I think) compared to Batman Beyond (which are ridiculously expensive; approximately $23 to $27.00 each). You won't regret buying this series!",1264636800,,835,4.758620689655173
2594922,4,B000FZETS4,"Apparently some had issues with season one of Glen Murakami's production of The Batman, a product of Warner Brothers Family.  Not having seen the first season, I can't comment.  The episodes in season two, have a consistent dark tone, action oriented style, and a semi-adult sense of humor.  The program may be aimed at teens, and the plots somewhat simplified and even silly, but the adventures feature some of Batman's more familiar foes, and are nicely animated, visually stimulating, and quite violent.  If you don't have any major expectations, the series is mostly enjoyable overall.

Bruce Wayne looks and acts a little oddly, and his public voice (when he is not with Alfred), is a bit on the youthful side.  Wayne's appearances however, are limited.  It is mostly about The Batman, and that character looks and sounds fine.  Voiced by Rino Romano, Batman is far from jovial, but the character is less brooding than in Batman The Animated Series.  Rather casually referred to as `the Bat', Batman is apparently still a newcomer to crime fighting, and is regarded by the police as a possible threat to the public, although Batman does have the silent backing of police commissioner Jim Gordon (Mitch Pileggi).  That being the case, Detective Ellen Yin (voiced by Ming Na) as his sometime assistant, adds some edginess to the stories, and is a nice change of pace.

Some of the villains, may deviate from their traditional look, but that was also the case with Batman The Animated Series.  Those with strong opinions and preferences, many have things to quibble about, but having seen many iterations of Batman through the years, I didn't take this series that seriously.  Some villains I didn't really care for, but most of the stories held my interest, and the writing seemed to get stronger as the season progressed.  Episode 7, The Butler Did It, features the Spellbinder working his influence on the local manservant population, including Alfred Pennywell (Alastair Duncan), instigating a crime wave.  Episode 12, The Laughing Bat features The Joker assuming the role of crime fighter, while Batman is suffering the effects of Joker venom.  Things get really interesting when the Penguin is added to the mix.  Featuring Adam West, Batman from the 1966 TV series, as the voice of the mayor, is a nice touch.  The season finale, Night and the City, features a three way team up, with The Riddler, The Joker, and Penguin out to unmask the caped crusader.  Add in Detective Lin under arrest, and you have one heavy duty escapade.

Some may wonder how family appropriate The Batman is.  While not suitable for young children, these 13 episodes on two discs, are probably suitable for teens and above.  The absence of subtitles, and chapter stops is a minor negative.  A series that seems to have potential, Season Three brings the coming of Batgirl, Poison Ivy, and other new characters.",1263686400,,2893,4.931818181818182

I'll plan to buy it somewhere else so that we can eventually see those 2 episodes.

This series departs from the dark shadows of 'Batman: The Animated Series' yet is just as entertaining. Characters are redesigned and Bruce Wayne is a much younger guy which must make this seem like more of young children's Batman, but the series is more than that. The Joker is a particularly memorable redesign different from any other Joker animated or otherwise. He is not so much evil as insane and extremely entertaining. Warner Bros. has done our entertainment a service by reopening their animation studios and doing such excellent work with the DC comics characters.",1223769600,,651,4.927272727272728

2594949,5,B000FZETS4,"Don't get me wrong. I'm one of the few that loved season one, but this season is better. There are so many classic episodes in just one season, and many turning points in batman's career. We are also lucky to get to see Commissioner Gordon in this season. I was also impressed with how every episode is its own. Last season, some of the episodes got redundant, but in this one that is not a problem.

As I did in the First Season Review, these are my top five episodes of this season.
1. Riddled (What a Riddler episode should be like)
2. JTV (Joker at his Best)
3. Ragdolls to Riches (Ragdoll is just great)
4. Fire and Ice (Great ""disaster"" episode)
5. The Laughing Bat (Another Joker great)

Before I go and make this sound like the best thing to ever happen to batman, I would also like to state some of the flaws. I believe that The Joker and Penguin are a little over used. While I do love this Joker, he seems to show up maybe just a little more than he should. I never really cared much for Penguin, and he is in here just as much as the joker. I was also a little let down with the way Killer Croc was done, I thought they could have been a little more creative. Even though I still don't like Mr. Freeze, I do like Firefly and their episode was very good.

Again, this season is an improvement over season one, but don't let that turn you away from season one, because it is also done very well. I recommend both seasons.",1218240000,,1431,4.15884476534296

During which, Commissioner Gordon comes into the show's setting, with the departure of Ellen Yin(whom you all should know as Ethan Bennett's partner on the force). The Batsignal is introduced, as well, which is especially cool since it is a part of the Batman mythos. The show is starting to pick up a little more steam as far as episodes are concerned and more villans are introduced. I must say, I really like the show alot.

2594953,5,B000FZETS4,"I'm 31 years old, and I have to say that this is my favorite Batman animated series.  I've watched the origial that came out in the 90's, and as much as I enjoyed Batman Beyond, I love the artwork, stories and non-stop action that is the new Batman series.

The second season picks up where the first left off, with the same good storytelling and voice acting.  For some reason, the Solomon Grundy episode sticks out in my mind as being one of the more interesting episodes I've watched.

I'm also a big fan of the Riddler and his modern gothic look.  The stories that are weaved around him are fantastic.  And while in some ways, it's not really fair to compare this version to the 90's one, I just think there are a lot of things it is getting right.  It keeps me coming back, at least.

Second season highly recommended.",1178496000,2,823,4.368421052631579
2594954,4,B000FZETS4,"I dove into the complete second season immediately after finishing the first season and can confidently state that The Batman does come into its own.  It is immediately apparent that the show's writers came into the second season with a much clearer understanding of the show's demographic and what its viewers expect out of the product.

Having said that, fans of The Animated Series will likely still fell a bit let down on account of the lack of background story given to the rouge gallery.  We do meet a wonderfully interesting interpretation of The Riddler right away that nearly makes up for the overabundance of Joker-based episodes that follow.  Also noteworthy are the villain team-ups in the second season- Firefly & Mr. Freeze, Catwoman and Penguin, even Riddler, Joker, and Penguin in the season finale.

We are also treated to some new rouge appearances, namely Killer Crock, Ragdoll,  and even an attempt to creepify the already creepy Solomon Grundy (which spits on the original origin-story as has become standard practice with this series).

However, this isn't to insinuate that the package as a whole isn't entertaining.  In fact it is best to forget The Animated Series ever existed and just approach The Batman as a different entity altogether.  The writing definitely took a turn for the better here and we're finally treated to some of the mystery and intrigue that makes Batman's rogue gallery interesting.  The season even ends with an encouraging appearance from the newly elected Commissioner Gordon.

DVD pundits who enjoy extra features be warned: There is basically nothing included in terms of DVD extras. The second disc includes a commercial for the Second Season (yeah the one you just finished watching) then ends with the encouraging message ""The Batman Season One now on DVD."" Hmm.

Overall though, an improvement in the show's content. I'm heading into Season Three tonight.",1177545600,,1912,5.092948717948718
2594955,5,B000FZETS4,"Short Summary: In the second season, Batman (once again) works overtime with his new 'assistant', Ellen Yin of the Gotham PD, and together, they take on even more challenges brought on by Joker, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and new foes such as Ragdoll and Riddler! In these episodes, you'll really get a feal for the villains -- especially Joker and Catwoman!

My Opinion: This whole new concept of Batman is not as bad as you think. I have watched and bought all the older Batman: The Animated Series, I have all the Batman movies, and I've even watched the 'old school' Batmans starring Adam West! I mean sure, some of the stories are not as great as the animated series, but that doesn't mean there aren't good episodes in here. I'm still watching The Batman cartoons even as we speak (including the new season 4), and in my opinion, the show is at its strongest peak in the first two seasons.
There are basically NO special features on both discs -- well, all except for this thing called 'catching up with The Batman' which is basically clippings of all the episodes from seasons one and two. It would of been a great thing if they showed it for the first season.

My Opinion of Great Episodes: I'm a HUGE fan to this new animated Joker, and this is my favorite season with him. He's in 5 episodes in here! Okay, okay...enough about that, what I think are great episodes list as follows:
1. ""Riddled"" (introduces the Riddler into the show, with his line of clever riddles of course)
2. ""JTV"" (Joker making a TV show of his crimes)
3. ""The Butler Did It"" (Is Alfred taking a life of crime? Batman throughly investigates this odd twist)
4. ""Ragdolls to Riches"" (Introduces Ragdoll going after priceless things...along with Catwoman hot on his tail!)
5. ""Strange Minds"" --my favorite episode in all the seasons! (Hugo Strange and Batman go inside Joker's head to find the whereabouts of Ellen Yin before it's too late!)
6. ""The Laughing Bat"" (Joker seems to be having an identity crisis, for he wants to be Batman now!)

Overall: As the people say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"", and so I say, ""Don't judge this Batman show by the way it looks."" I was skeptical at first about it, but when I saw a few episodes, I realize this show isn't as bad as other people think. I'm not saying all you Batman fans are going to love this show, but it wouldn't hurt to just watch a few episodes, or purchase the first season for that matter.",1174003200,,2437,4.509049773755656
2594956,5,B000FZETS4,"It's good but it could be better. However, all the the new story lines aren't needed, it just shows how bad of a writer you really are when you must change story lines to give your writing team or person an edge. I still gave them 5 stars",1168560000,,238,3.9791666666666665
2594957,4,B000FZETS4,"Wasn't sure I liked this new Batman.  Am a long-time hard core Batman fan.  But I agree with previous reviewers; it is an ""Ultimate"" Batman and it is starting to grow on me, especially this second season.  I actually like that Bruce Wayne is a bit goofy, does silly stuff.  He is a young Batman and shouldn't be as jaded as the Wayne and Batman of the BAS... his voice shouldn't be as deep as Conroy's.

Two episodes that really stand out; the new quadruple jointed raggedy doll villian (Ragdoll to Riches)....what an incredible piece of creativity and animation...an interesting twist that Catwoman was trying to steal a piece of rare cel animation as opposed to the typical cat statue with ruby eyes,  and the episode inside of the Joker's mind (Strange Minds).  I can't believe that Timm's group never came up with that episode!

Think of this Batman series as the Smallville of the Superman legacy.  It is a bit quirky, has humor and should not be missed if you like Batman.

However, a few hours later I just happened to re watch ""Mad Love"" from BAS! Boy I miss the BAS, but then again, can that level of creativity, writing, animation be sustained?  What a jewel of a series!!",1168473600,3,1182,4.5545023696682465

2594980,3,B000FZETS4,"The second season of The Batman, a manga-ish attempt to showcase the early days of the Dark Knight, is far from perfect, but it is a big improvement over the first season.  In the first season finale, Batman's (voiced by Rino Romano, and no, he's no Kevin Conroy) police officer ally Bennett was transformed into Clayface thanks to the Joker (by far the best episode of the series), and that storyline continues as Clayface comes to a cross roads and makes a choice on his future.  Also, we see the debut of up and coming Detective James Gordon, who seeks to make Gotham City a safe place to live again, with Batman's help.  The biggest complaint of the series has been the treatment of the villains, and while there is an improvement this season, you'll still find some amount of annoyment.  I'm not too fond of the Riddler or the Penguin, but the Joker is much better in these episodes, and even Professor Strange (voiced by the late, great Harry Goz of Adult Swim's Sealab 2021) is here to boot.  All in all, the second season of the much maligned The Batman isn't the same kind of greatness we got from the Paul Dini/Bruce Timm Batman animated series, but it is a vast improvement over what we've seen from the series before.",1167955200,6,1229,4.518018018018018

2594982,1,B000FZETS4,"I was hoping that the 2nd season would be an improvement from the 1st season, but sadly it is not.  I am a major batman fan and grew up on Batman: The Animated Series, Batman/Superman Adventures, Batman Beyond, and Justice League.  The previous cartoons had great scripts and in depth charactors that made it exciting to watch....I am finding that I am going off topic.  The batman is not the cartoon for die hard fans of batman over the age of 3.  The show is written for a much younger audience that does not need a captivating script and deep charactors.  Instead this show focuses on the action sequences and way too many witty comebacks.

I have to say this, but what the heck is the Penguin doing when he is fighting batman?  Has he traveled the world and studied numerous martial arts?  Since when can he jump from tree branch to tree branch and swing around and kick batman?",1165968000,,882,4.46875
2594983,5,B000FZETS4,"I know The Batman isn't popular with many Batfans, and the criticisms that have been levelled at it are sometimes just, but I've got to say I REALLY enjoyed this 2nd series. It's a marked improvement on the 1st season.

Batman; The Animated Series, and it's makers various offshoots (Batman Beyond, Justice League & JL Unlimited) are unquestionably the BEST animated Superhero programs ever (Marvels early 90s SpiderMan could be added to that list also). The Batman was always on a hiding to nothing because it was after Batman TAS.

The radical reworkings of some of the villians can be an issue - it takes a while to get your head around some of them. Some work, some don't. I like Catwoman with her big goggles. I think the extra nasty, martial-artist Penguin is excellent. However, I hate the even more Psycho version of the Joker with his big wacky fuzzy bonce. You'll have to make up your own mind..............

Significantly, I honestly think The Batman, has got the best ever TV Bruce Wayne. He's got a bit of a modern face-lift and he isn't quite so serious and (dare I say it) stuffy as many of his screen counterparts. By Bruce Wayne though, don't make the mistake of thinking I also mean Batman - I don't (that's Kevin Conroy or Christian Bale).

The animation here is superb. I love the way they picture Gotham, and if you ignore the radical reworkings of some of the villians, the other characters are very well done.

All in all - it's not as good as Batman; Animated Series - but it ISN'T the catastrophe that many Batman fans make it out to be. If you've not got any Batman cartoons, go and buy any of the 1st 3 boxes of ""Animated Series"" first. Do not start here.

If I could give it 4.5 stars I would - I've had to opt for either 4 or 5, and I've opted for 5.",1165017600,,1779,4.39209726443769

2594985,4,B000FZETS4,"O.K., I get that some people don't like this version of Batman.  I also grew up watching Batman the Animated Series and I was elated when they became available on DVD.

So when I learned that the WB was going to start up a new Batman series, I was excited.  I watched the series premiere with great anticipation and was, for the most part, ambivalent about it.  I caught most of the episodes of the first season, and while I was glad that Batman was back on T.V., it didn't really evoke the same kind of feeling that BTAS had.

Then I saw the two part series finale of season 1, which focuses on the origin of the new Clayface.  Here we finally got a glimpse of what this new creative team is capable of when they put some real effort into their storytelling.  And this trend continued into season 2.

People will make their comparisons to the original series.  Hey, that's only natrual.  I've been interested in anything Batman since I was a kid.  I'm old enough to have seen the campy T.V. series.  I've read the comics throughout the years and even watched the some of the horrible movies they've put out there.  But I think that some people fall into the trap of nostalgia when they compare this series to BTAS.  People tend to gloss over the not so pretty parts and claim that everything was so much better way back when.  Batman the animated series was great, no argument there.

But I also think that this new series really has it's place in the annuals of Batman.  It offers a new take on old villans. One reviewer called it Ultimate Batman (for those of you who are familiar with Marvel comics' Ultimate line), and I think that's a pretty good way of looking at it.  And, I'm sorry, but Strange Minds, and a few other episodes from season 2 stand up very nicely when compared to stuff from BTAS.  Season 4 premiered with an episode about the origin of the new Robin which was excellent.  While Batman is hunting down the criminals responsible for the death of Richard Grayson's parents he wipes out an entire bar full of baddies and tells the last one still conscious, ""Tell him I'm coming for him, tell them all I coming for them.""  We see the guy hanging from the ceiling by his feet, as he is trembling at the sight of Batman's eyes through the dark, smoke-filled room.  To my recollection, this might be the best moment in Batman's animated history.

Some people are going to disagree with me, but before you dismiss this series, I suggust that you give it a look and decide for yourself.",1161216000,12,2501,4.4126637554585155
2594986,4,B000FZETS4,"Thats how i view this series.  They are pretty much ""revamping"" Batman.  That can be a bad thing, but this show has done a pretty good job! I have followed Batman since I could walk and this show impresses even me.  Pretty much all of it walks outside the DC Comics.  The names and places may be the same, but these charectors are not what I grew up with. And thank god for it.  Don't get me wrong, I love the comics (maybe not some of the movies though), but The Batman is breathing new life into an old dog and it works!  There may be a few missed opportunites, but it's a 30 minute cartoon, so please don't judge it too harshly or base everything on what you've seen before.  Just my thoughts.",1158192000,5,696,4.149253731343284
2594987,5,B000FZETS4,"I'm not too sure how I feel about this new incarnation of Batman.  Some episodes seem a bit more kid based than others for one thing.  That, and Kevin Michael what's his name is trying too hard to be Bruce Tim's Joker.  Don't get me wrong, the guy's a great voice actor, but it would have been nice if he had delivered to us his own portrayal of the Joker.  Because one can try to recreate Mark Hamill's take on the clown prince of crime, but it just can't be topped.  But I did grow up watching the original Batman animated series, so its hard seeing a new series come along.  I enjoy the creater's take on Clayface, though.  Although that two part season finale from season 1 is sort of similar to the Twoface two parter from Batman Tas, to me.  I mean, in both cases, you got a guy who's been friends with Bruce forever and a day, and all of a sudden he's gone bad, and Batman's all torn up emotionally.

  I also wish Comissioner Gordon had been more involved in the series before the end of season 2.  It is neat to see Robert England providing the voice for the Riddler!  Go get him, Freddy!  It'd be nice if they threw some Easter Egg at the fans having something to do with Nigma growing up on Elm Street or something, since this new Riddler is a bit more gothic and creepier than John Glover's performance from Batman Tas, although Glover's voice is somewhat freaky as well.  I wish he'd get to play a small role in this new incarnation of Batman.  Tom Kenny makes a pretty good Penguine.  Guess he kinda got tired of providing the voice for Spongebob.

  I agree with another reviewer, don't start with season 1 of this show.  I did, and have yet to see the second season, and I hope it was better than the first.  Maybe Bane will get more screen time.  That was one villain I'd have liked to see more of in Bruce Tim's series.

  Ok, I'm done rambling.  I'm not a big fan of this incarnation, but I think I'll buy this season when its released in September just to have something to watch until October 24th.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll enjoy it.",1155513600,3,2053,4.246113989637306
2594988,4,B000FZETS4,"The first season of The Batman is a very good example of what happens when a new team arrives, finally taking over from the twelve to fifteen year era of Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Ted Blackman, and Eric Randoski, and find themselves struggling with the dubious task of living up to the legacy of Batman: The Animated Series.

Their early efforts were met with more than a large dose of criticism, the first season led to The Batman being considered one of the most blatantly childish toy commercials ever produced, a Joker that seemed to resemble Goku addicted to Brand X and with a lousy Mark Hamil impersonator, a bland Year One attempt at The Batman's early life, complete with his being pursued by the GPD and the relentless Ellen Yin and her partner Bennet (an ally of The Batman) which seemingly never came close to living up to the standards of GPD/Batman battles seen in Year One or The Dark Knight Returns, and lousy throwbacks to the classic Tim Burton movie designs of Catwoman and Penguin just when the New Batman Adventures had finally liberated those characters from those constraints.

Fortunatly, salvation came in the first season finale, which shook up the series' status quoe in a major way, paving the way clear for what would become The Batman's finest season so far. A little more experianced, and with a few great writers such as Greg Wiesman (creator of Gargoyles) helping out, the second season goes forward with a darker edge, and even improved vastly on some of Batman's rouges gallery.

The epsiodes included on this DVD include ""Meltdown"", an emotional and action ridden epilouge to the season one finale that sees Batman's close freind Bennet finally decide on where his career as Clayface will take him as his thirst for vengeance against The Joker drives him to near murder.

The dark tone of the show continues with ""Riddled"", which reinterprets and redefines the character of The Riddler, transforming him from a small, bowler hatted puzzle meister into a Marilon Manson-inspired gothic master of mysterious metaphores, whose ambitious attempts to unmask Batman threaten Gotham City with destruction whenever Batman and Yin are forced to solve his riddles and get closer to him. The Riddler is immediatly elevated here from B-level villain to a nemesis worthy of The Batman's attention, and he plays a large role in the second season finale.

The Joker's deranged personality is given a look at in the brooding ""Strange Minds"", featuring the late Frank Goz as Professor Hugo Strange, another old school Batman enemy who will become more important in the third season. The episode is as close as the show's ever gotten to emulating the tone of the Bruce Timm series and is highly recommended. The season ends with ""Night and the City"", which again shakes up the staus quoe and introduces Commisioner Gordon to the series. Given I'm not the biggest fan of season three, I can only caution you folks to relish as much screen time as Gordon gets here...its' the only time he's done justice so far in this series.

As an action peice, the episode paces itself tremendously, and there's a few twists and turns that unfold as Batman battles The Joker, The Penguin, and The Riddler as they seek to unmask him and take Gotham City itself prisoner. It's a finale worthy of a Bruce Timm product

The flaws regarding the second season are as obvious as the first...Yin practically goes from being a potentially interesting nemesis for Bruce with utterly squandered potential to an ally for The Batman with utterly squandered potential, she takes more of a back seat and becomes a ""damsel in distress"" in several episodes, sometimes in a fitting way, sometimes in ways that insult her previous track record.

Another flaw is the tremendous amount of Joker based episodes, the character was overused in the first season and he suffers here also, fortunatly this time he has two classic episodes (""Strange Minds"" and ""The Laughing Bat"") that truley captures the roots of the character for the first time since the series began.

That aside, The Penguin and Catwoman have not improved, in fact their characters suffer from being general wallpaper with nothing of note to bounce off on, ""Ragdolls to Riches"" is a poor example of this, as Selina plays second fiddle to Ragdoll and nothing is made of Selina's visit to Wayne Manor, neither is an attempt to follow up on some of the subtle moments between Selina and Bruce, once more The Batman's self-contained nature betrays it's potential.

The Batman is one of the most debated Batman animated series yet, it has it's fans, and it has it's haters, I count myself as not much of a fan of this series, but I am objective enough to know when a show is trying to improve, and this is one example of this. Just avoid the first and third seasons",1153958400,26,4804,4.805084745762712
