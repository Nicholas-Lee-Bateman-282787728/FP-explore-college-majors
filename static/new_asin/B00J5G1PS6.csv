6333469,1,B00J5G1PS6,"I rented this from red box, and being a scientist was attracted to the name.  Like one of previous reviewers mentioned, the movie is so far from being scientifically sound that it hurt my eyes watching it.... The movie claims that winds blew an airborne virus from the Middle East across Europe all the way across the Atlantic Ocean to the US.  Really?!  That's the best movie writers could do?  You'd think at least a plane or boat of infected people could have sufficed.

But seeing a lot of things portrayed unrealistically I can look past this.  What really got me was that the movie was all over the place.  One moment we're in the present and dead people are everywhere the next we're in the past and some sex is going on, then we're looking at a girl running across a meadow???  This would been OK if there was something that tied these scenes together, but as is it is simply confusing.

There are movies that I've seen that are worse than this.  However, those movies tend to be so bad that at least humor can be had when watching with friends or such.  This movie on the contrary is like a black hole where neither humor nor entertainment can escape to the viewer.  All the movie does is suck away time.",1402012800,12,1213,4.390134529147982

After a man made virus escapes the entire world is threatened. The fast moving and fast acting bug is bringing about the end of the world with no hope for a cure. Three couples each deal with it in their own way. Even though their stories and experiences are different they realize that life revolves around one thing, love. For some reason ideas and plots for movies seem to come in clumps and no matter what they get made back to back to back. Armageddon and Deep Impact came out very close together. So did Volcano & Dante's Peak, Olympus Has Fallen & White House Down, and Legend Of Hercules and soon Hercules. This movie is part of the new up and coming trend, movies about a man made virus that causes the apocalypse. Contagion, It's A Disaster, Goodbye World and the more recent ones just to name a few. All of them have their good qualities but like so many copy cat movies they are never as good as the original. This one is no exception. Overall, good movie with a very good cast but it is very depressing so you must be in the mood for it. Not as good as Contagion. I give this a B-.",1401408000,4,1228,4.32034632034632
6333473,2,B00J5G1PS6,"This is not a science fiction film. The background for the film is that someone in the Mideast releases an airborne pathogen that kills people on contact and is traveling in the northern hemisphere from east to west, i.e. against the prevailing winds. I know of no such biological agent and I can't imagine the controls it would take to develop one or why one would do so.

That said, this fact was fairly immaterial to the film. This is NOT a film for science fiction fans. This is another end of the world film that is about relationships more than the science. It is filled with metaphors. In fact it is so filled with metaphors and overt about it, that it lessened the effect.

We have a guitar pic that looks like an explosion in it.

We have a discussion about cleaning a dish as being a metaphor for a relationship.

We have the Trilobite discussion as there were once billions, now they are scarce. As Charleston Heston might yell: ""Parts Per Billion... it's people!!!""

The whole theme of the film, in case you couldn't grasp it, is read by Anna (Teresa Palmer) off a shampoo bottle near the end.

The characters are not really that exciting. It has three couples to follow and does so in part as a flash back making the film a bit confusing, perhaps by design. If you really loved something like ""Melancholia"" you might like this one.

It is also one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen.

Caution: Depending on your point-of-view, there could be Spoilers ahead.

Like with Stanley Kramers ON THE BEACH (1959), writer/director Brian Horiuchis film deals with the end of the human race, brought on by mans own hand.  In the case of the Kramer picture, the cause was nuclear fallout, but in this 2014 release, the culprit is biological warfare.  The conflict may have begun in the Mideast, but trade winds are spreading the contaminant throughout the globe.

The screenplay centers on three couples and how each duo deals with the approaching doom.  All three couples lives are interlaced in one-way or another.  Frank Langella, married to Gena Rowlands,  is a wealthy scientist who, years ago, worked on the project that, ultimately, led to the worlds current plight.  His attorney in a legal matter regarding the project is Rosario Dawson, and her husband is an out-of-work writer (Josh Hartnett).  The third couple is Penn Badgley, a struggling musician, and his insecure fiance, Teresa Palmer.  Badgley is Langella and Rowlands grandson.

Aside from their various relationships, the couples have something else in common: Love.  Will love survive the impending disaster?

Well made as it is, this is not a movie that I would like to see a second time.

Millennium Entertainment releases PARTS PER BILLION onto Blu-Ray.

6333483,5,B00J5G1PS6,"Hoooo-eee. We have some tough nuts here. One star? I guess I must have watched a different cut. The story is leisurely in its build, yes, but never for one moment was I bored or woolgathering. I was never confused as to time and space, despite the non-sequential nature of the tale. Simple setup, regardless of the scientific validity of this metaphoric film: Three couples face the end of all things. ""Not with a bang, but a whimper."" When all things end, they will end sadly, nothing special, just the dear banality of life's ordinary moments. Here, like the end of a life, like last words that are also nothing special, they're made precious by the context. People love each other. They quarrel. They shrink from love. They have regrets or rationalizations. They are real people, giving themselves over to the last minutes they will have, until the final scene offers something different that will not be revealed here. No car chases or cannibal tribes. No giant robots or zombie apocalypses, this is a gentle film about an overwhelming sadness that seems spectacular in the idea, but is universal in reality; all our stories end, some with promise, some not. We struggle to survive, to breathe, to find love, to cope with losing love. That is what this movie is about, and in that way, it is quietly masterful. One must watch it with a quiet mind, and in all these one-star, dismissive, disappointed reviews, I'm sorry to say I don't see a lot of that. Overall, if you don't mind the occasional string quartet mixed in with your Sensurround, this is a tender and worthwhile bit of poetry.",1413244800,7,1592,4.709677419354839

6333505,3,B00J5G1PS6,"With the familiar faces of Teresa Palmer, Penn Badgley, Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, as well as Frank Langella, you must admit this seems like an interesting collective for a film. Especially with their stories all to be connected, much less with this possibility of death due to biological weapons hanging in the air. But, the question is, with a limited amount of time before a major portion of the Earths population being wiped out, will the film lead you to care about three sets of people?

Characters & Story

Things begin with us being presented what in any other film would be the introduction to a love story. Young Anna (Teresa Palmer) and Erik (Penn Badgley) live in this cute house together, seem barely into their adult years, and yet are helplessly in love. But, in order to pay for the house, Eriks grandparents, Esther (Gena Rowlands) and Andy (Frank Langella), give him money. Something which increasingly is becoming an issue as he seeks to establish himself as a musician.

Though Andy likes giving his grandson money, especially considering his money, which is in millions, was gained through dirty business deals. Which is how his association with Mia (Rosario Dawson) comes about for she is his lawyer trying to protect him from the possible issue of him breaching his contract with his former employer. Then, lastly, when it comes to Len (Josh Hartnett), he seems to be an almost polar opposite to Erik. For while Erik can spend his days with his girlfriend and write songs, Len seems to be someone who may have been big at one point and time, but now is broke, jealous of his wife Mia, and has only his sister Sarah (Alexis Bledel) and friend Rick (Hill Harper) to vent to.

And all together we watch these characters deal with a bioweapon attack which happens in western Asia, with its effects spreading, despite wind currents, across Europe and then to the United States.

Praise

If you focus on each of the three sets of stories, you can see a full length movie within itself. Like the story between Anna and Erik could easily be combined with Andy and Esther and make a quality and cohesive film. For the romance between Palmer and Badgley is not only cute, but compelling. As is this huge amount of guilt Andy has over his involvement in creating bio-weaponry, if just because he wanted to give his daughter, Eriks mom, a few more years. And while this may make you think Dawson and Hartnetts roles are just extra fat, if anything they too could be separated and with Dawson being Andys lawyer, having marital issues with Hartnett, and then with the bioweapon outbreak, again you can see a full fledge and quality story come about.

Criticism

However, instead what is given is a story which has too many cooks in the kitchen, sort of speak. I say this because, like most films which try to spread its focus this thin, you never feel like you can truly get into the characters for your attention quickly gets snatched away as they move the focus to develop another set of characters. Then, to add onto the films problems, it doesnt go in chronological order. Which bugged me because not only was it not in order, but there was no notification so that you knew what the timeline is for when certain events happen. Such as whether the event took place 2 months before the bioweapon, during the bioweapon attack, or 2 days after the attack, and so on. And while details like that may not seem major to most, but when you are switching between sets of characters with the time period shifting, it does have the potential to confuse you. Also, considering the significant moments which Palmer, Badgley, Langella and Rowlands have, not presenting a chronological order, or at least informing you of the time period, does slightly weaken the overall story, as well as make it a bit more difficult to get the emotions from the actors and take it in.

Overall: TV Viewing

To me, this film is the prime example why splitting the focus between 3, or more, sets of characters should be avoided whenever possible. It leaves you wanting more when you really shouldnt have to, and you can always find one set, or one characters story, which is weak enough that you wished it was simply cut to accommodate the more focused on characters. And because of this slightly disjointed storytelling, and the inability to really get into the characters, Im labeling this as TV Viewing.",1403654400,,4393,4.693506493506494

This movie explores the lives of three couples and how they react to and deal with the news of a deadly biological agent that's been unleashed somewhere in the Middle East and slowly spreading to the East coast.  While all three couples are aware of the impending doom, not all are prepared or willing to face the challenges ahead.  Actress Rosario Dawson does bring up one interesting point while safely hunkered down in a sealed off basement with her fianc while waiting for conditions to improve over time; she asks herself whether it would be worth it to survive only to emerge from her protected space and deal with the macabre scene that awaits or just give up and accept her fate.  Decisions, decisions...Anyway, I would have given this rental 1 star, but since I'm partial to anything that Teresa Palmer stars in, this automatically bumps my rating up at least 2 more stars.",1466553600,,1189,4.6380952380952385

The writer, the actors and director have the responsibility of making us care about the characters and their problems. They failed miserably. It's hysterical that this movie was even made without somebody realizing what a bomb it was. Was it shown in theaters? I'm glad I didn't pay to go see it.

I paid 50-cents for this stink bomb at a garage sale... and I feel cheated out of my 50-cents. if you find it at a garage sale for 25-cents, pass it up.",1442966400,,545,4.494949494949495

8648275,4,B00J5G1PS6,"Perhaps the biggest problem with a film like this is how to market it.  Many years ago in a comedy routine, I think Steve Martin was discussing, with a straight face, how to make appealing titles versus bad titles.  He said something like ""Starting with love always sounds appealing.  Like 'Love in the time of...' that will catch people's attention.  Then he went on to say you wouldn't want to end that with ""the plague"".  ""Love in the time of the plague""--that would NOT be a good title.  That's the movie we have here: Love In the Time of the Plague.

Most people writing reviews don't like it; their complaints seem to fall into a few categories: That it's unscientific, as in ""The winds don't blow in that direction"".  That the story isn't linear, and some people found that a bit hard to follow (probably while they were Facebooking at the same time).  That they were expecting a hard-on disaster movie and instead what they got was a relationship movie.  That there were ""too many metaphors"".  Well maybe it's just trying to establish a bit of cosmic balance, because most movies anymore seem to have NO metaphors at all...

You can separate people into two basic groups: Those who HAVE seen, even owned and used, the EXACT brand of liquid soap referenced in the movie, and those who HAVE NOT!  Sadly if you are in the ever-growing latter group, you'll miss the comedy of the references to it here (yes, in my opinion, it was funny).

If you want a disaster movie to play out like some kind of future history lesson, completely plausible and grounded in fact, then what the heck made 2012 so popular?  No, I don't think most people care that much really, whether an end-of-the-world story is scientifically completely plausible or not.  It's FICTION!  Does it tell an interesting STORY or not?

Now we come back to the basic problem of finding your audience.  As soon as you describe the essential plot line, everyone thinks, ""Oh--a movie about the END OF THE WORLD....hmm...I like those kind of stories (in which case, you probably don't like the movie"" or I DON'T like those kind of stories...in which case, you probably don't even bother to watch a movie you might have enjoyed.

Hey--it's not like the end of the world is THAT terrible.  [Or, more properly speaking, what appears likely to be the end of mankind].  There's a silver lining to every dark cloud you know.  No more rush hours to endure!  No more worries about funding social security!

More seriously, I actually did enjoy the film.  Yes, it's a bit on the slow side.  It also keeps essentially the same pace all the way through.  It starts slow...and stays the same.  Along the way in what seems a quite simple story, the writer(s)? and director manage to cram in an awful lot of observations about human nature.

These were, generally speaking I thought, quite good actors and actresses appearing in a straight-to-video film, that does not even have any special features available on the DVD (except subtitling--thank God, there's at least that much).  So, either they were all desperate for a few dollars, or they all found the story interesting enough that they wanted to be a part of it.  Frank Langella, playing the part here of a scientist in the twilight of his years and deeply regretful for the research he did, was the most familiar face to me.  Rosario Dawson and Teresa Palmer both just looked so good on the screen I didn't particularly care what they were doing, and Gena Rowlands gave a fine performance as Langella's wife.  But pretty much everybody gave good performances.

In summary, this is not your usual disaster movie.  Nor horror movie.  Nor your usual relationship movie.  Nor sci-fi.  Certainly not a comedy, though a few scenes were very briefly funny.  It does have some elements of all those things, but it's more a musing on the nature of mankind, as seen through three couples in particular.  I watched it straight through in one sitting, and found it worth the time spent for one viewing.",1431734400,2,3996,4.683908045977011
