705726,4,6303679021,"This is a surprisingly good--and totally unknown--film.  It's a black comedy about an emotionless guy, Cosmo (Jason Priestley, who does a terrific job) who takes on the role of hitman for the mob.  The local mob boss is played by Robert Loggia with the first name Gordon (another hoot--how many mob bosses are named Gordon?) with aplomb, and Michael Fox has a very amusing cameo as Gordon's accountant.
Cosmo is single and even though he loves his job--taught him by experienced hitman Steve (Peter Reigert)--he wants to be in love.  The only ""love"" he has ever known is via Honey, a matter-of-fact, all business hooker played very well by Janeann Garofalo.  He meets Jasmine, a yoga instructor, and pretty soon they are connecting.  Along the way, Cosmo carries out a string of hits, most supervised by Steve, that show off the excellent black humor on display here.
The ending is very satisfying; the writer-director, Wally Wolodarsky, does a great job of combining the themes of love and violence right at the endpoint that underlines how acidly funny the film is.  Will Jasmine and Cosmo find real love together or not?  The ending provides a great answer.
A shame this did not make it to DVD.  Highly recommended.",1043452800,,1218,4.85024154589372
705727,5,6303679021,"First, the name of this movie is not ""Cold Blooded Murder.""  Amazon has confused the title with the Michael Moriarty film of the same name.  This movie is called ""Cold Blooded.""
The movie is original and funny.  Priestly does a beautiful job with the role of a reluctant hitman just promoted from running book for an organized crime outfit.  His character is a borderline sociopath, but still on the side of his personality that cares a little about what he is doing with his life.
Peter Riegert, as always, is funny in this movie.  He plays Cosmo's mentor, and he helps to really make the story work.
Buy it, if you can find it!",1009238400,,629,4.482456140350878
705728,5,6303679021,"God, is it fun to watch Jason Priestley in this film!
The expression on his darling face makes you want to kiss him five times on each cheek.  A few more closer to the ears!
His acting is very convincing as a loner who crunches numbers for the Mafia until he gets promoted to hit man.  He struggles with his conscience, verbally at first.  Then he decides to do what he has to do in order to get away from the violent career and win over his new girlfriend.
The black humor is superb.  Jason looks especially sexy in a suit and tie.  Robert Loggia is funny, as are other supporting actors. Michael J. Fox plays a character who looks like he has cheated the Mafia and spent their money to become the ultimate yuppie complete with nerdy glasses.
Did another reviewer on Amazon.com describe Cosmo (Jason's character) as ""nerdy?""  Wrong!  Cosmo is loaded with sex appeal, a darling personality and fun.
I especially loved the way Cosmo greeted the lady at the front desk of his apartment building:  ""Hi, Rose.""
Ooh, Jason's voice in those moments!
Rent this movie as soon as you can.  That means you, too, ladies.",987984000,,1109,4.505
705729,5,6303679021,"I can understand why some people didn't like this movie; it's not your typical hero's journey. The good guy is a bad guy and doesn't deserve the girl's love. His mentor is just as despicable... although Steve (Peter Riegert) is easily my favorite character. Cosmo can only complete the character arc (and make himself a ""better"" person) by forcing, at gunpoint, the woman he loves to accept him, and moving from hired killer  to willing murderer.

I saw the relationships and characters as complex, and I really enjoyed the movie. Rent the film, if you don't like it, forget  about it... but those of you who enjoy dark and quirky will find a gem.",958953600,5,647,4.657894736842105
705730,4,6303679021,"First off, I was bored on a Saturday night and desperate to see a movie, so I saw ""Cold Blooded"" on the shelf, with Jason Priestly's face on the cover and started laughing....I said, Priestly a hit man?....Well,  this movie was an excellent piece of film.  Priestly was so unpredictable  as a hit man named Cosmo who falls in love with a Yoga Instructor played by  Kimberly Williams (Father of the Bride), so decides he wants to get out of  the Mafia business.
Honestly this movie is a must see....A little garish  with the blood, but one of the best dark comedies I have seen in a long  time.
Unfortunately, AND I DO NOT KNOW WHY! this movie went straight to  video.  With word of mouth this movie could of definitely been a box office  hit.
I wonder what studios are thinking sometimes...They release  Priestlys ""Calendar Girl"", but put ""Cold Blooded"" on  the shelf?
Also cameos by Michael J. Fox and Robert Loggia.
Honestly a  pleasant surprise!",949104000,,948,4.604790419161676

705889,5,6303679021,"I just purchase this because my ""other copy"" got misplaced by someone...yeah right.  They just wanted a copy of their own.

The thing is, there is very little else to be said as other people have given the plot and told exactly what makes this so good.  Definitely R rated, definitely has moments of incredible dark humor.  If you can watch a guy beg for his life while somone (who is trying to kill the guy) is trying to learn how to use a gun, then this is the movie for you.  Scenes in this movie, if described to you without seeing it, would be VERY hard to demonstrate the humor in them.  Note above about a guy begging for his life...you'd never see the humor in it, unless you saw the movie.

This is a low budget feature however the writing is wonderful.  Look for a small role by Michael J. Fox that is also done very well with one of the most shocking events you'll see in film connected with his character.

A must see if you like dark comedy, hitman, or other type films.  If you loved the video game ""Hitman 47"" (any of them) then I'm almost positive you'd love this movie.",1169251200,2,1086,4.228155339805825
705890,5,6303679021,"I went to see this at the Seattle International Film Festival in 1995. I went because the synopsis sounded interesting. Plus the guy who had written and directed it was connected with the Simpsons, surely a major plus when it comes to comedy. The audience was filled with teenage girls, obviously drawn by the name of Jason Priestly on the marquee. It made the subsequent viewing of the film THAT much funnier (well, at least to me) to sit there and wonder what these girls were thinking as the film progressed and Priestly started killing folks with such wonderful deadpan indifference. This movie is SCREAMINGLY funny. Peter Reigert is top-flight comedy gold in every scene he has as the burned-out veteran hit-man. The real revelation is how funny Jason Priestly can be when given a chance. His character here is almost like Peter Sellers from BEING THERE; he is so impassive and deadpan, yet the film revolves around his performance and it must be good for a film like this to work; well, Priestly delivers. His character is goofy and sweet and yet somehow chilling too in his casual attitude to murder. Why this film has languished in total obscurity is a mystery. When i saw the film, most of the audience didn't know what to think; the teenage girlies were rather shocked;they didn't find it amusing to see their 90210 heartthrob pistol-whipping people before icing them, but I did. When the film ended, the director, Wallace Wolodarsky, was just sitting there, alone. He had introduced the film briefly beforehand and said he'd be happy to field questions when it was over. I approached him (since no one else was going to) and I think I frightened him a bit with my exuberance; I had a shaved head at the time and i looked a bit weird and I said, too loudly, ""That movie was brilliant! It was hilarious!"" He said,""Thank you,"" and slowly backed away from me. I thought, ""well, you can't win them all."" And I left him in the theater filled with people who didn't understand his movie.",1150761600,17,1991,4.6752136752136755
705891,5,6303679021,"THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE ON DVD! I am waiting for the DVD to buy it.

How could you not love the Dark Humor in this movie that is delivered in an innocent and simple dead pan is brilliant. Jason Priestly wowed me in this role as Cosmo.

705892,5,6303679021,"I gave this movie five stars not because it is worthy of an Oscar for best picture, but because a good dark comedy is hard to find.

705895,4,6303679021,"I really don't have anything to add to the previous review. It nailed it spot on. Bottom line: this is a GREAT buddy mobster hit man dark comedy. It deserves to be a cult classic and made available on DVD. I have friends that would love this movie but have become DVD snobs now and won't consider watching a VHS tape. I guess they deserve missing out on it. My motivation for writing this is to express my frustration that such great movies like this can slip through the cracks and never get exposed to many potential fans of this genre.

Anyone that appreciates the humor in 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Boondock Saints' or 'Thursday' would love this movie. I suspect that part of the reason this movie has not caught on more is that anyone who would be a fan of 'Pulp Fiction' would automatically shy away from any movie that starred Jason Priestley from 'Beverly Hills 90210'. All I can say is that is not fair. Johnny Depp started out on '21 Jump Street' and was an over commercialized teen heart throb too and he turned out to be a pretty damn good actor in some pretty damn good movies. So get over it and give Jason a fair chance. He is brilliant in this movie and earned my respect with his performance. And this is coming from a regular heterosexual guy who has as much dislike for 90210 as you do!",1109289600,11,1298,4.341563786008231
705896,5,6303679021,"I never fail to be astounded this movie is nearly unknown. Cold Blooded is the most inventive, thoroughly enjoyable black comedy I've ever seen. It's a crime it's not available on DVD.

I first became aware of Cold Blooded when a friend told me, ""You've got to see this movie. I've shown it to four people so far and they've all loved it."" Since then, I've also introduced four people to Cold Blooded - and they've all loved it.

Cold Blooded stars Jason Priestley as Cosmo. (One hilarious thing about this movie is that, with only two exceptions, none of the characters has a last name.) Cosmo is, well, dumb. I'm not saying he's a moron, that's overstating matters, but he's definitely operating with a subnormal IQ. The only thing he's good at, almost an idiot savant, he's really great with numbers. Thus he makes his living as a bookie for a local mobster. Then Cosmo's boss is wiped out by his second-in-command, Gordon (Robert Loggia, wonderful as always) who decides, for some ungodly reason, Cosmo should get a ""promotion"" from bookie to hitman. This of course makes no sense, but it's the hook that gives us the rest of the movie so we'll let it pass.

Cosmo is put under the tutelage of an experienced hitman, Steve (Peter Riegert, probably best known as Otter, the guy in Animal House having a very conflicted relationship with Karen Black). Riegert was the perfect choice to play Steve, projecting world weary cynicism, a desert dry sense of humor, and a surprising level of real liking for his new pupil. Riegert's drollery and comedic timing in this role is beyond reproach. For my money the funniest moment in the film is Steve's line as he's teaching Cosmo gun safety on the firing range: ""Remember, guns don't kill people. WE kill people.""

It's amazing that in this film we see Cosmo kill again and again, even people who are, to all appearances, totally decent, and we never lose sympathy for Cosmo. Jason Priestley, in my humble opinion, is seriously underrated as an actor; he imbues Cosmo with an underlying sweetness that shines through no matter what he does. It's eerie. Cosmo is a sweet, likable multiple murderer. And if you thinks that's easy....try it some time.

I would be remiss did I not mention that Michael J. Fox (who also co-produced) has a wonderful though, um, brief role as Gordon's accountant, Tim Alexander. Apparently when you're co-producer your character gets more than one name. By extension, Tim's wife Jean also has two names.

Janeane Garofalo as Honey, Cosmo's current long-term hooker, has the second best line in Cold Blooded:

Cosmo: But I thought we had something kind of special. Like you were my girlfriend.

Honey: Cosmo, I like you. Of all the people that pay to have sex with me, I like you the best.

Steve begins teaching Cosmo the ropes, including taking him on his first hits. And Cosmo is great at it, a total natural. He's so dumb he doesn't panic when things go wrong. He has just enough mentality to feel kind of bad about the people he kills, so he starts taking yoga classes to deal with the stress. And it's there he meets yoga instructor Jasmine (Kimberly Williams), an almost elfin beauty.

Cosmo's greatest sorrow is that he's never been in love. He's never had sex with anyone other than hookers like Honey, never even been on a real date. And he wants to be in love, to have an actual girlfriend. Jasmine might be The One. Just a few teeny-tiny obstacles in the path of true love: (a) Cosmo senses his job might be a problem, i.e. if he tries to quit, his employer will kill him - and besides, would Jasmine understand? (b) Jasmine already has a boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), a real jerk who doesn't treat her right. How Cosmo deals with Randy is one of the highlights of the film.

Will Cosmo be able to extricate himself from his job as a hitman? Will he and Jasmine get together? Will Cosmo ever know true love? Watch Cold Blooded and find out. And be prepared to start telling friends, ""Hey, you've GOT to see this movie....""",1087603200,6,4008,4.630985915492958

Preistly is too starightfoward with his character, he plays him so wooden and that sorta kills it off but then the good ending where he pops Loggia and then confronts his wanting to get back together with Kimberly Williams. funny part is when Josh Charles comes to Williams house mad demanding her, then Preistly decks him in the face with his gun, nice.
