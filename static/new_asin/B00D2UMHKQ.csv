8588727,4,B00D2UMHKQ,Purchased as a gag gift. The movies are sequels to the original Attack of the Killer Tomatoes movie. Funny because they are deliberately awful parodies of horror movies. The Rotten Tomato score is something like 30%. Didn't have any problems playing the DVD.,1461283200,,258,5.023255813953488
