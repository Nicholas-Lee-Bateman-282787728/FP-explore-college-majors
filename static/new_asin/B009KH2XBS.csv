8542479,5,B009KH2XBS,A little known series with great characters. It's a wonderful and engaging satire. It also tries to break a lot of boundaries (including some trans-themes and same sex attraction). I would have loved to see how it would continued in a second season...but unfortunately that looks unlikely to happen. We can only imaging what the show could have done.,1493942400,,350,4.9491525423728815
