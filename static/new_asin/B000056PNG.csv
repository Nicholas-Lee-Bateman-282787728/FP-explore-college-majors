7932717,3,B000056PNG,This one gets repititive. Same old thing over and over. The guest host are dry and look like they are reading their lines off a card. They can forget the humor they attempt. The music is probably the best part. That's too bad since I bought it for the basketball mainly. The clips are not that great. Save your money.,1015977600,,317,4.3
