8223087,1,B00009L4ZT,"this is the worst crap I have ever seen in my life! i thought volume 5 was bad... this mixtape couldn't have been made any worse. after seeing ball access, i was expecting volume 6 to be really good and just like it except without all the messing around, but i was wrong. if and 1 keeps going in this direction, it will lose all their true fans. if you want to watch some real basketball, get volumes 3, 4, or 1, when streetball was about people like hot sauce, main event, and skip, not some cheap, sorry guy with ugly handles named ALIMOE. i cannot believe the kind of publicity that and 1 is giving to this guy... even i have way better handles than him. hot sauce and headache would cross him up any day. the only thing decent on this thing is ""sauce's crosses."" this could be the beginning of the end of and 1. before you know it it'll be all trendy and cool like EBC, extremely bad crap.",1080518400,,893,4.167630057803469
