7924441,5,B00004VY8G,"Two great French actors - Jean Gabin and Jean-Paul Belmondo - brought together in a B&W movie that combines emotion, nostalgia, action in the context of the post WWII. Fantastic script, impactful performances, powerful dialogues, great character development. To be watched absolutely, even by English-speaking people who love art.",1334102400,2,330,5.755102040816326
7924442,5,B00004VY8G,"Looks like the latest wave of French films being released by Koch in Canada on R1 discs does not have English subtitles.
A shame, I was looking forward to seeing this classic on DVD properly.
Hopefully someone in the US will pick up these titles sometime....",1181779200,3,258,4.630434782608695
7924443,5,B00004VY8G,"Savoir vivre!. This movie tells a singular story of two peculiar personages. One of them is the owner of modest hotel, and the other a young man, plenty of illusions, with a beautiful daughter of ten years and with serious intentions to leave France and make his dreams come true in Spain.

When both men  meet, they will make a solid and affective friendship. The final sequence with these nocturnal fireworks is unforgettable.

A tour de force acting with these two emblematic actors. Jean Gabin and Jean Paul Belmondo.",1158537600,3,521,4.831460674157303
7924444,4,B00004VY8G,"Translated as 'A monkey in winter', this film sees Jean Gabin continuing his dour personna as a hotelier, who recognises in a drunken hotel guest an early version of himself.

There then follow several drunken escapades, before both return to their normal, sober lifestyles.

It's quite watchable, if not exactly exciting. But, viewer, be warned: my VHS copy has a very poor quality picture - either that, or the film was deliberately shot in half-light. Also, the entire film is compressed for the TV screen, so you actually only get around 60% size.",1133827200,,551,4.913978494623656
