8330100,1,B001OB9L5O,"Just a heads up.  This DVD is the same as Yngwie Malmsteen LIVE!! which was released by Dream Catcher back in 2000, now discontinued. It has the same track list and it also was Recorded live in Brazil, May 1998.  I now have both.  Don't get me wrong on the one star, this is still a great DVD!  Double my Yngwie pleasure.",1237939200,13,321,4.129032258064516
