8080329,5,B000AY6S2A,"Little Bear, is the most wonderful collection of learning, cartoons, for toddlers and preschoolers, I first discovered little bear, when my oldest granddaughter, who is 9 now, was a baby.  Her and I would watch them every Friday, when she would come to stay with me.  We both fell in love with it.  It is so nice to have a show for them to watch, that is about nothing but friendship, love, curiosity, and learning. Instead of fighting, dark, and sarcasm.  Little bear and his friends, have many many adventures, always doing something to help each other, and take care of one another.  Then there is the shows with his parents and grandparents, which are also just as wonderful. I feel it teaches the kids manners, and patience, and all kinds of social eddicit. All 8 of my grandbabies have grown up watching this wonderful series with me now, and each and everyone has loved them.  Little Bear is just plain good TV.  I even find myself watch them still even when the grandkids are not here.  This series is highly recommended, if I could give them more than five stars I would.",1449705600,2,1080,4.5595854922279795

8080331,5,B000AY6S2A,"This might be my favorite little bear. The episodes focus on when Emily moves near Little Bear, and they build a house for her and her grandmother. Also the first time Little Bear meets Uncle Rusty. And a super fabulous episode when Little Bear and his parents get snowed in at Emily and her granny's house. And, another fabulous episode about the Winter Solstice. I lovvvve it!!",1392595200,5,379,4.6716417910447765

8080336,4,B000AY6S2A,"I had to take a star off. The stories were great, the only thing that threw my child off was that the opening song was different and each story jumped right into the next without displaying the episode name. They market the DVD as a full length feature but it was not. It was just a bunch of episodes bunched into one.",1236988800,10,318,4.145161290322581
