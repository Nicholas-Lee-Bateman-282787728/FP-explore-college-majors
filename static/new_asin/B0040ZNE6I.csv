This cinematic depiction of Filipino life, it's myriad ways both endearing and disgusting, was remarkable when you could just consider that most of Pinoy flicks had been trivial. Ms. Lolita Rodriguez, the lead actor, must be credited for moving this Brocka film to greatness, with her talent to portray tragedy, not soapy melodrama, with rare intelligence, sensetivity and conviction-- a classic for all movie afficionados.",1400544000,3,546,5.3604651162790695
