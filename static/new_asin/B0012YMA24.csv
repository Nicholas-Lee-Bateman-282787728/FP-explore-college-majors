8248294,5,B0012YMA24,"I tried to find an appropriate title for this review and ""lovely"" is what I came up with because this series by Abba Eban is truly that. The cinematography, the music (John Duffy), the narration and the story mesmerize you with its beauty. I love this piece of work. Nine episodes of about 45 minutes each.",1242777600,,306,4.482142857142857
