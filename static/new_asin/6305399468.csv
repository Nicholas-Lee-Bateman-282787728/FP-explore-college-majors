7889423,1,6305399468,"This is your typical drive-in B film with a thin plotline and plenty of T & A. I find it a pale imitation of ""The Swinging Cheerleaders""; Rainbeaux Smith and Robert Carradine couldn't even help this film along, although it's funny to see Carradine in an early role as a popular-crowd jock, when he's better known as playing a Nerd in the ""Revenge of Nerds"" series. A fun look at 1970's fashions and fads, including mooning and souped-up vans which doubled as mini-hotels for studs to score. Unfortunately, along with the dumb plot, the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, and the movie drags at times. Picture quality has seen better days--looks like a worn drive-in copy was used as the master print. If you want to see a fun, campy cheerleader film, check out ""The Swinging Cheerleaders"", available on DVD at amazon.com. ""The Pom Pom Girls"" is mindless fun if you're drunk or stoned--then the movie will seem screamingly hilarious. But if you're sober, you'll probably agree: ""Las Chicas Porristas"" es muy estupida. Muchas Gracias!",992736000,,1041,4.988505747126437
