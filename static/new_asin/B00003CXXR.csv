1290502,5,B00003CXXR,"I recently just read the novelization of JP3 and it sounds like a great movie.  Tons better than ""The Lost World"" and almost on scale with the original.
In JP3, Sam Neill is back as Alan Grant, who is recruited by a wealthy couple (played by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) to guide them on plane over Isla Sorna for their anniversary.  But the couple is actually looking for their son Eric, who accidentally landed on the island while para-sailing.  Needless to say, the plane crashes and the group is chased around by fierce dinos (including the new Spinosaurus and Pteranodon).  I don't want to spoil the ending, but lots of people are eaten and there are many surprises in store.
Oh and I forget to mention that Laura Dern is back as Alan's now ex-girlfriend Ellie Sattler.
All in all, JP3 (or Jurassic Park III as Universal is keen on calling it) sounds like it'll be a fantastic summer movie and blockbuster.",993340800,38,913,4.548780487804878
1290503,4,B00003CXXR,I have seen both jp movies and i loved them.

1290504,5,B00003CXXR,"Based on the previews, I'd say that this is going to be a great movie.

1290820,3,B00003CXXR,"It is always fun to see dinosaurs eat people. I like the chase scenes and the ""stay in the car"" scenes. Even the consumption of a satellite phone can be fun. But you can only dumb things down so much before losing any plausibility. In a mediocre movie you root for the creature to eat the dumb person that walks up to it and says, ""Aren't you just the cutest thing?"" In this one the characters are not worth eating. The story line and execution are so incredible that it does not matter that there are transparent to the viewer form the start. They should have went ahead and made it campy.

Basic story is paleontologist would not set foot on island of ancient creatures. Mysterious couple with lots of cash just wants him to point out the highlights from the air (yeah sure).

One item in the plus is Sam Neil has more than one expression.",1502841600,,841,4.350318471337579

1290828,3,B00003CXXR,"Well, I'm sure everyone knows that the first movie in a series is almost always the best and the Jurassic Park - ahem - franchise (....) is no exception.
The special effects are, of course, awesome, but you do find yourself wishing these people would just leave the poor dinos alone or at least get eaten by them.
The story is nonsense, the acting borders on cringeworthiness - Tea Leoni in particular would have been better off staying home in Hollywood, I mean, 'Oklahoma' (which is where her character is supposed to be from), and we have, like in Jurassic Park 2, a bunch of non-athletic mall walkers and homebodies turning into action heroes when confronted with prehistoric creatures -who are quite understandably displeased with their presence.
My suggestion: Get the most complete Collector's Edition set of the first one you can find, forget the others were ever made.",1498608000,2,877,4.89261744966443
1290879,3,B00003CXXR,I guess it's only natural to start comparing movies when thy go on and make multiple sequels.  Everyone seems to think that this is the worst of the Jurassic Park movies.  I don't think it's that bad.  And really don't think it's that much different then the first two.  And there is a totally unique scene of having to dig through dinosaur poop to find a phone.,1498435200,,362,4.358208955223881

1290886,3,B00003CXXR,"Plot holes the size of pterodactyls. Billy and Allan should've kissed or something because there was no obvious reason the two were on the island together. The parents, Macy and Leoni, were badly scripted to send ""mixed signals"" about their feelings for each other. It didn't work because it wasn't remotely well done.

But the Spinosaurus aegypticus, the raptor family, and the rest of the CGI was outstanding for 15 years ago and good for today.  For $3, I'd say it's a nostalgia trip; if not, pass on it, watch The Martian.",1489017600,,526,4.706521739130435

1291149,3,B00003CXXR,"After Jurassic Park and The Lost World:Jurassic Park have become box office hits that grossed millions of dollars worldwide, another sequel came into into the series which resulted in Jurassic Park III. Joe Johnston took over the directing chores from Steven Spielberg after the latter declined to do the third installment of the film series. This is also the first film that would not involve the original author Michael Crichton into the creative process since it is not based from any of the novels that he has written.

The story is set on ""Site B"" of the fictional deserted island Isla Sorna located near Costa Rica at Central America. Wealthy couple Paul and Amanda Kirby has double-crossed scientist Dr. Alan Grant into having a fly-over on the said island. The purpose was a sightseeing tour of the cloned dinosaurs. After they all landed in the island,the Kirby couple try to locate their lost teen-age son after being involved in a paragliding accident. Trapped in the island,they try locate the missing son amidst the danger posed by the said dinosaurs particularly the Tyrannosaurus Rex,better known as the T-Rex, and the flying Pteranodons,which is said to provide more danger than the T-Rex.

No question that the third film provides a darker and more thrilling scenes. We get to see more scary and violent scenes as compared to the previous films combined. Viewers are treated to more non-stop action and violent scenes with the cloned dinosaurs especially with the different characters involved. Just like the second film,it once again does not concentrate on the characters but more on the cloned dinosaurs that are ready to kill anytime. Nothing really happens in it as the primary purpose of the story is to locate the Kirby's son and to remain alive at the conclusion of the film. Overall, viewers wanting to see thrillers provided by dinosaurs will probably be pleased by it.",1478822400,,1896,4.977917981072555

1291544,3,B00003CXXR,"Worst of the franchise, this movie screams 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if the dinosaurs terrified everyone in 3D?.  Let's throw something together'.  Perhaps this was better in the theater, perhaps if you like 3D on your TV it would have some charms, but fundamentally it was lots of running around trying to not get eaten by dinosaurs that seemed to have a specific taste for human flesh rather than just being animals, with a bunch of gratuitous camera shots that were supposed to look good in 3D.  Watch it once to say you've seen the whole franchise, but don't expect much.  Move on to Jurassic World for a decent revival of the franchise",1462147200,,640,4.587719298245614

1291663,5,B00003CXXR,"This might be considered the weakest of the series since it's more involved with parents finding their young son, blown onto the island whiel hang-gliding. Tricked into going with them thinking he'll get funding for his current expedition, Dr. Allan Grant from the original movie once more prevails against a creature that can take down a T-rex and a pack of velociraptors who have evolved to communicate, hunt in packs, and avenge themselves on those who steal their young.

There may be new dinosaurs, including one who looks like a cross between T-rex, an alligator, and a dimetrodon, and a new innovation as the scientist uses a model of the velociraptors nasal air chamber to make the sounds communicating with the creatures, but  all the scriptwriters can do with the rest of the story is new variations on the escape theme.  There's less onscreen killing, and a few light moments as the cell phone one of the victims was carrying ends up in the dino's belly and then in his poo. Ewww!

It's tense, the dinosaurs are as usual, awesome, the escapes hair-breadth. We're left with a definite cliffhanger in this one, however.

This movie was viewed in a theater and also by purchased DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1460678400,,1254,4.787037037037037
1291664,5,B00003CXXR,"This is my favorite out of all 4! This movie feels more like a continuation of the first one than the second one since Sam Neill was more of a main character than Jeff Goldblum. Plus you get the introduction of the Spinosaurous which in my opinion is one if the scariest dinosaurs! They also showed flying dinosaurs in this one which was highly anticipated after the first two. Another of my favorite things in this movie are the behaviors of the raptors, I'm not sure if it's confirmed that all the things they said are true about how raptors were but none the less I still enjoyed going on the journey of wonder.",1459728000,,614,4.394736842105263
1291665,5,B00003CXXR,This movie was great! My daughter wanted to watch it before we watched Jurassic World. Full of action and lots of dinosaurs. It is amazing to watch movies that involve dinosaurs since we never got to really see them. The plot was good and the action was amazing. The dinosaurs were so realistic. It involved a family looking for their son that got shipwrecked on an island full of dinosaurs so they set up a rescue plan to try and find him.,1459468800,,440,4.378048780487805

1291750,3,B00003CXXR,"I actually love this.

I acknowledge this isn't a great film, and it possesses none of the greatness and novelty of the first film, but it was infinitely better than the first film.

The goal was to introduce more dinosaurs, and in that, the film succeeded.  I loved watching new dinosaurs, no matter how brief.

I found this film to be more intriguing, more interesting, and more enjoyable film than the second film.  This film was good on its own.  The human characters were interesting, and I enjoyed the story.

I'm only giving it four stars because it was great, but there were too many trainwreck decisions. In the first movie, there were just a couple really bad decisions in the beginning that made the whole plot unravel; in this movie, it's just a series of bad choices that keep snowballing, but those choices are what drive the plot. It's not quite as clever, but definitely as thrilling.",1439164800,,506,4.5

1292728,4,B00003CXXR,Excellent movie. I like the bigger dinosaur in it. It was way bigger than Rex. The story wasn't as good like the first one. But it made a good sequel. Excellent actors and actresses. And they only brung one from the first movie Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill). Sometimes I think why can't they bring all characters in the first movie. I think we all question that. But there are a lot of action scenes. And they show dinosaurs in to more scenes. Also the end is always awesome.,1438819200,,472,4.314606741573034

J#1 was dumb but expected.  2 was so bad & brainless it was painful.  3 had a couple of up moments, but still one has to wonder who would actually pay writers for this.
Tell ya what... If you like this, you'll love the worlds stupidest movie ""Frozen"" (not the cool Disney one). This one's about 3 people stuck on a ski lift.

1292853,2,B00003CXXR,"Whereas the first movie felt like a legitimate attempt at storytelling, this installment appears more about cashing in on the Jurassic Park brand. It is somewhat entertaining in a roller coaster fashion (not to denigrate roller coasters), with tons of action, yet lacking any real compelling moral or further understanding of dinosaurs to walk away with. I must've read a review or something when it came out 15 years ago, because I passed on it then. I viewed it to further my 12-year-old boy's fascination with the series. Perhaps the best part was comparing and contrasting, afterward, a quality versus nil story. And in that light, I can report that, to him, Crichton's novel wins hands down for him.",1438214400,,704,4.92436974789916

1292916,2,B00003CXXR,"I should probably have given it one star. Only a short time into the movie, I was so annoyed with the characters behaving so stupidly that I was rooting for the dinos, especialy T-Rex, to snack on them. Especially the Tea Leoni character and her hubby, both of whom are normally very good actors. Tea using a bull horn to call her son's name on an island infested with  carnivorous beasts, that they were fully aware of; the ridiculous plane escape attempt and subsequent crash; another egg stealing human, who only brings on near disaster for all, etc. by the time these characters evolve, they had alienated much of any sympathy for them that I had in the 2 previous Jurassic films. This 3rd movie doesn't live up to chapters one or two, which are great. The story line for this disappointment was just a poor imitation of the previous two and not nearly as well executed. But there are some good parts such as the pteryldactyl scenes, near the end of the film; but too little, too late.",1437782400,2,989,4.5251396648044695

Watched this one with my granddaughter, which made better (for me).  She remembered Mr. Jetters from him being on Sesame Street, she was hoping that nothing bad would happened to him.
The actors all had to be in shape to do as much running and screaming as they did.
Again, this movie has been replayed again and again over the years.  Yet, I hadn't watched it.  It's strange when you realize all the things you'll do for your grandkids.",1437523200,,599,4.427272727272728

It might be worth a watch once or twice, but it doesn't really further the story at all and the majority of the characters are annoying.  Sam Neill and the velociraptors are the real stars of the film.

And don't even get me started on the fight...luckily, that was somewhat justified in Jurassic World.

One example is the unexplained demise of Ben, the boyfriend/parasailing guide.

Our focus this time is on survivor of the first one Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill).  He's quite content to stick to studying dinosaurs via their bones after his near brush with death.  But then Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) come and offer him major money if he will guide them in an airplane trip over Isla Sorna, the second island InGen used to actually breed the dinosaurs.

What Dr. Grant doesn't realize is that they intend to land on the island because their son Erik (Trevor Morgan) is missing on the island.  When their plane is destroyed, they must find a way to survive long enough to get rescued.  Can they find Erik and escape?  Or are they now dinofood?

There is a part of me that likes this film.  As it progresses, the action scenes get better and better.  They introduce Spinosaurs and Pterosaurs, and it's cool to have the major scenes feature different dinosaurs for a change.  Heck, T-Rex is reduced to a cameo here.

The plot is fine for a Jurassic Park plot.  I mean, really, it's just an excuse to see dinosaurs chase and eat people.  That's really all either of the first two were.  Admittedly, this has the weakest premise for getting people to the island, but I'm willing to buy it.

Let's face it, the characters are just props to get killed in these movies, and that's the case for many of them here.  We do get to know a few of them better, although their character arcs are rather predictable.  The actors do a decent job with the script they have.  The acting isn't award worthy, but it works.  Speaking of characters, Laura Dern's Dr. Ellie Sattler makes a brief cameo in the film.  Even though it's a small part, they make her character an important part of the story.

The real star here is the special effects and the dinosaurs they create.  And here the movie shines.  As with the first two, I buy the mix of computer and traditional effects and brings these long dead monsters to life.

So far, it sounds like I like this movie, right?  Well, I do have some problems with it.  After two movies, one of which was on this island, how can we have new species of dinosaurs pop up?  I know the characters in the second movie didn't go everywhere, but it seems like they would have noticed the Spinosaur since he was everywhere.  The Pterosaurs are in an aviary, so the lack of their presence in previous movies makes sense except that we see them flying over the island at the end of the second one.

I know, I know, I'm being too picky.

My other complaint is the Velociraptors.  No, it doesn't bother me that they've changed their look.  But what does bug me is that they have made them much, much smarter.  The intelligence level is not something that can be explained based on what we've seen in the previous movies.  I swear, if they ever make a fourth movie, the Velociraptors will be talking.

But I'm probably over thinking what is basically a modern, high tech monster movie.  Jurassic Park III isn't the best or worst of the trilogy.  It's fun for a mindless monster movie.",1432339200,,3256,4.406722689075631

Except instead of Jason, or teenagers deciding to go into cottage out in a secluded where legendary deaths occurred drink and have sex, you have dinosaurs for the dino junkies. Here, in J3, they wind up on the island infested with dinosaurs because of stupid actions by idiots that put others in s*** situations. It's the hipsters from the Suburbs stopping at the urban bar-pool hall for that authentic inner city feel, only to realize that they're in way over their heads from the word go. And from that point on you just wish practically every single human become dino-floss. And in some cases the provide that. The rest of the movie builds on nil plausibility and stupid thinking.

JAWS (spectacular) JAWS2 (decent entertainment) JAWS3 (campy fun) JAWS:The Revenge (eww,i had to say speak its name,ew)

The Jurassic Park franchise follows closely. The first was not just sheer entertainment,but a bit of a thinker,and revolutionized moive compute FX )your welcome Michael Bay). The Lost World was a fun adventure,and almost as thrilling as the first. Made with enthusiasm and smart. And now Jurassic Park III...at least Jaws3 almost knew it was as silly as it was. here,they really beleive they were making another great entry.

POSITIVES:
*They got Sam Neill back. I was hoping Jeff Goldblum could of joined but an injury prevented it-always been curious what his characters role would have been.
*We got some new dino's...Pteradons were finally shown in a lead capacity,thank you. And the Spinosaurus was neat,just wish that they didn't have to toss the Rex aside so quickly but,i suppose it was needed to show how bad the Spino was. Afterall,its hard to character development for prehistoric creatures with no lines
*Continuity..we see Grant and the gang going through the same complex as the previous film,even letting us spot the jeep that Ian tried taking refuge in
*William H Macy...he may be this series Michael Caine. A Solid actor is a not terrific movie. Though JPIII is worlds above Jaws4,dont get me wrong.

NEGATIVE...
this is what ruined the movie for me,and its the first scene. The first scene sets the tone. When i first watched Caddyshack II,I knew by the time the title popped up that i wasn't watching Caddyshack quality comedy. I emjoyed it,but i lowered my expectations.
So thanks to the opening scene in JPIII...another law of films is,when the first scene is a bomb,you go 'uh-oh""
Why?
OK...ill tell you (spoilers)

When the boat below the para-sailing Ben & Kirby is 'attacked' and left without anyone steering,the duo flip out. The boat is heading for some rocks,and the people in Titanic didn't get this freaked out,ok?...
the kid even starts screaming ""were gonna crash""....
does he know they aren't actually ON the boat? Your sailing in the air about 300 feet ABOVE the boat and rocks. So,in their panic they cut the rope and sail off onto Site B.getting this thing started.
THATS where the 'what the F'-meter goes off for me.
You cut the rope? Whats the worst that could of happened if you stayed tied to the boat?

A) The boat crashes on the rocks and..your still up in the air (not on an island filled with dinosaurs)
B) The boast crashes on the rocks and..you lost wind resistance,floating down to either land or water (still not Rex food)
C) The boast crashes and you get down to it,using the radio to call for help if its not sea-worthy (hey Gilligan!)
D) The boat crashes and catches on fire...now,since the rope is - (i assume) - not dripping with kerosene,so the fire will not travel up the rope at super-movie speed and burn you. You'll have plenty of time to cut the rope and take your chances on where you land thereafter (psst...Raptors don't tan,so head for the beach,the outer rim of the island)

So yeah...taking in the possible outcomes of not being afraid that our sail will somehow blow up once the boat down there lands on some rocks...id take my chances and not cut my only link to possible escape / calling for help,rather than steering for THE FREAKING ISLAND FULL OF DINOSAURS

So,now that we got plausibility out of the way,enjoy the pretty neat little B-movie with a dumb opening, a relationship that should of been, no real climax and a happy-sappy rescue ""Is this man with you Dr Grant""?

What I like:  sound effects(after the plane crash in the jungle; the scenery/view of the mountains and water-especially in the beginning of the movie).  What I dislike:  Billy's attitude and/or behavior(stealing rapture eggs; his attitude towards Dr Grant-I understand that Billy wanted to save Eric's life after he was carried away by one of those creatures, and I commend him for that.  But he should've asked for advice from Grant since he(Grant was the expert).  It was sad to see Grant express his disgrace toward Billy, but if Billy knew better, then why did he do it?  And what I also disliked:  Grant being pressured/sucked into(through the Kirby's lies)in going over to that island-being forced to something he didn't want to do.  Mr. Kirby could've found other people that Grant knew could help him.  Thank God Grant managed to survive.

1295502,2,B00003CXXR,"Character Assassination of Dr. Grant

Jurassic Park the original movie spent a lot of time developing the characters of Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, throughout the entire movie we watched Dr. Grant transform from a man who feared and disliked kids and not wanting anything to do with them, to a man who would make a wonderful father and mentor of kids. Dr. Grant's character grew as a person right before our eyes, and the natural progression of his character would be to marry Dr. Ellie Sattler and have kids of their own.
Instead Jurassic Park 3 had Dr. Grant unmarried and alone, and visiting Dr. Sattler and her family, husband and kids... Dr. Grant character development in the original movie was all for nothing, he had not grown at all as a person, in fact he even lost Dr. Sattler to another man... Dr. Grant again in Jurassic park 3 faced with mentoring another kid Erick Kirby he takes to it like a champ. Dr. Grant again shows that he would be a great father. Dr. Grant our Jurassic park hero that we all love has not grown as a person at all... very disheartening and disappointing.

They could have made the same movie, with Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler married with kids living in that big house, as a family. Dr. Grants character development would have been complete and come full circle tying the first movie and the third movie together much better and at the end of the movie it would be his wife that saves the day.

The character assassination of Dr. Grant was written by these idiots, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor and this train wreck of character development was directed by Michael Crichton, and together they took our hero Dr. Grant and made him the biggest loser of them all... Other than destroying the foundation of the first movie and character assassinating Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler, the rest of the movie was great, it had dinosaurs in it!",1386806400,,1893,4.578171091445427

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The original Jurassic Park' came and went and banked a billion dollars. When `The Lost World' did almost the same, a Third film was inevitable and so the unimaginatively titled Jurassic Park III' was born into existence. Relatively speaking, Jurassic Park III is a slight disappointment, but not a total disaster. With Steven Spielberg gone from the director's chair, is now replaced by Joe Johnston, ho was the director of the disasterous and embarrassing film Jumanji' and so the Jurassic Park saga has been slightly downgraded to its B-grade monster film roots. The first Jurassic Park was a well-paced adventure movie wrapped in a magical package that used state-of-the-art special effects and digital sound to make us believe that dinosaurs could once again roam the earth. The Lost World: Jurassic Park II, while panned in some corners, basically offered more of the same tightly-paced action and adventure. Unfortunately, Jurassic Park III not only re-hashes the two previous outings with hapless embarrassing humans hunted by hungry dinosaurs, but does it with far less style and human interest. This time around, there's no build-up to the first appearance of the dinosaurs and they are suddenly there. Character interaction, never is a strong suit in this particular film, even worse than perfunctory, it's virtually non-existent. Every action piece is staged in a generic fashion, leaving no room for suspense or tension. And the whole film is over so fast, especially sans credits, only about 1 hour, 20 minutes, that it hardly seems to have happened, still it is not a total disaster and I still enjoyed viewing it, as I still love this franchise.

Anyway despite this, here is a synopsis of the outline of the film. When a young boy is left marooned on the island of Isla Sorna, his parents Paul Kirby [William H. Macy] and Amanda Kirby [Tea Leoni] trick Dr. Alan Grant [Sam Neill] into flying with them over the island to help find their son. But when the plane crashes and they are left stranded, it's every man for himself. This time there's no fences, no weapons and absolutely no protection and ensuring this won't be a normal walk through the park.

Jurassic Park III' entered production without a completed script and whilst Director Joe Johnston does the best with what he has, it's reasonably obvious that production was difficult. Barring the lengthy end credits, the film comes in at a scant 80 minutes and very short for a modern day film. Still, this is completely about the dinosaur action scenes, of which there are probably more than the first and second films combined. It also marks one of the last large projects for the Stan Winston's animatronics studio, who have become a victim of the fast growth of CGI animation. Stan Winston himself sadly passed away a few short years later.

Jurassic Park III' isn't really terrible, but as the third entry to a much loved film franchise series, who has a sizeable fan base, like me. Compounding this is the troublesome ending that materialises, rather than coming to a natural conclusion. I just hope that Universal Pictures can make Jurassic Park IV happen, if only to give the series the conclusion it deserves, but I doubt this will ever happen, as too many years have passed us by, oh well, we will wait and see. Jurassic Park III may not offer much in terms of originality or story, but it is still a fast-paced and fun thrill ride that doesn't wear out its welcome. Like its two predecessors, there is little doubt that this latest instalment has sort of done well, and that the pteranodon's seen flying into the sunset at the close of the film will somehow end up in Jurassic Park IV, lets keep fingers crossed and find out.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Jurassic Park III' is presented in the awesome 1.85:1 aspect ratio (original aspect ratio), and a stunning 1080p encoded image. Again, it's fairly obvious that Universal have used an off-the-shelf transfer for `Jurassic Park III,' but its relatively young age makes this the stand out of all of the trilogies, so it isn't all bad. The transfer is very sharp and offers a pleasing amount of fine detail. The upgraded texture maps on the computer generated dinosaurs, especially the new-look raptors and the Spinosaurus look very realistic and convincing. However, it's very easy to tell the CGI and animatronic creations apart. Jurassic Park III' was released in 2001 when film colour grading was starting to get increasingly popular and the film looks strangely dark because of it and almost like the entire film was run through a neutral density filter one shade too dark. It's always looked this way, so this is not a fault of the transfer, but in comparison to the other films, it just looks weird. I noticed a handful of small, but relatively unobtrusive film artefacts, but certainly no film-to-video issues. Overall, this is a pretty decent transfer, just hampered by some of the original production methods.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The main audio track is encoded with 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Just like the Blu-ray of the original, the audio track is the stand out performer, which represents a significant (and I mean significant) upgrade from the 5.1 Dolby Digital 5.1 track on the inferior DVD. Again, the audio has been extrapolated into a 7.1 experience, using a variety of techniques. This is by far the most aggressive of all the Jurassic Park audio mixes, and the films emphasis on action certainly allows this to come to life. I never thought I'd say it, but the .1 low frequency effects are a little 'too hot' and overly aggressive. Take for example the T-Rex vs. Spinosaur fight early on in the film. Almost all the low frequency is diverted to the subwoofer channel and hardly any is given to the full range channels. So, if you don't have a subwoofer, or have it turned off, it sounds like they are tip-toing. I don't believe this is film mixing as it should be. The channel should be to support the films bass, not provide it solely. Unfortunately, John Williams bowed out of composer duties for the third entry, being replaced by Don Davis, who was at the time hot off The Matrix. Davis uses the irreplaceable Williams' cues and main theme, but his original work is mostly pedestrian. Overall, an extremely pleasing and definitely awesome inspiring audio track.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Special Effects Team: The conversation features the special F/X team Stan Winston, John Rosengrant, Dan Taylor and Michael Lantieri, providing an enjoyably detailed technical look at the film. Granted, the men focus their attention primarily on the animatronics and digital effects, but it's also precisely what makes it such a fascinating listen. Understandably, their exchange is scene specific, but they fill in the gaps with recollections on the production and thoughts on where practical effects now stand in modern visuals. For fans, the commentary track is informative and very interesting.

Special Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: The Third Adventure [2013] [1080p] [25:00] The final instalment to the six-part documentary features certain members of the cast and crew reminiscing about the production and working with director Joe Johnston. Viewers can enjoy lots of good Behind-the-Scene footage while everyone talks about practical effects, set design, shooting on location as well as in a soundstage and the choice of the Spinosaurus as the new villain. Really interesting stuff, especially if you're a fan of the film.

Interviews with the cast and crew give us a sneak peek at the film. The movie used many different new dinosaurs compared to the first two films; here we examine how they'll look in the final product. A brief look at the action for the film is also shown, but not to a great extent.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Industrial Light & Magic Press Reel [2001] [480i] [10:14] This is exactly what it sounds like - a press reel showing the work done by Industrial Light & Magic for `Jurassic Park III,' including dissections of how the various shots were put together.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Sounds of Jurassic Park III [2001] [480i] [13:35] This time Laurent Bouzereau piece focuses on the work of Christopher Boyes, who took on the job of creating the various dinosaur sounds in the footsteps of Gary Rydstrom's great work on the first two films. Other contributors to this documentary are Don Davis, Tony Eckert, Joe Johnston, Dennie Thorpe and Jana Vance.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Art of Jurassic Park III [2001] [480i] [7:55] This particular Laurent Bouzereau piece focuses on the design work of Ed Verraux, who took over the art department for the third film. Other contributors to this documentary are Rodolfo Damaggio, Joe Johnston, Kathleen Kennedy and David Lowery.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: Montana: Finding New Dinosaurs [2001] [480i] [4:21] This documentary is mostly an interview with palaeontologist Jack Horner who is the real-life basis for the character of Alan Grant in the films. Jack Horner describes the work his team does as we see video footage of their then-current dig. As Jack Horner points out, the real work on understanding dinosaurs isn't happening in a gene lab, but instead out in the field, where the fossils can be found.

Original Feature: Behind The Scenes:

Original Feature: Original Documentary: Tour of the Stan Winston Studio [2001] [480i] [3:14] This is a very quick look at the work that goes on at the Stan Winston Studio, where the large mechanical dinosaur puppets were created for these movies.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: Spinosaurus Attacks The Plane [2001] [480i] [1:48] This is a compilation of film footage and on-set video covering the early Spinosaur attack in the movie.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: Raptors Attack Udesky [2001] [480i] [0:59] This is a compilation of film footage and on-set footage covering the fate of Michael Jeter's [mercenary] character, including an interesting shot of the puppeteer literally walking in the feet of the velociraptor doing the main attack.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Lake [2001] [480i] [1:38] This is a compilation of film footage and on-set video of an underwater attack by the Spinosaur on the hero boat.

Original Feature: Original Documentary: A Visit to Industrial Light & Magic [2001] [480i] This is really a whole section in its own right. It's a comprehensive overview of the work Industrial Light & Magic did to bring the dinosaurs to life. This subsection is itself divided into the following parts:

Original Feature: Concepts [2001] [480i] Here we have concept materials for ""The Spinosaurus,"" ""The Pteranodons"" and ""The Raptors"" (or the redesign work done for the third film. An introduction begins this section. These can be viewed individually or a ""Play All"" function.

Original Feature: The Process [2001] [480i] Again starting with an introduction, this shows various stages of the creation of various elements and shots. ""Models"" includes an Interview with an ILM CGI worker who shows the various stages of a CGI dinosaur model, including wireframe and muscled versions. There is a second option, to simply view the model in close up as he describes the differences between versions. ""T-Rex vs. Spinosaurus"" includes an interview about the creation of the scene, a production plate showing the live action without CGI, and a look at the final shot as seen in the film. ""Pteranodon Air Attack"" includes an interview about the scene, an animatic of the shot, and then the final shot of Allesandro Nivola meeting a Pteranodon the wrong way. ""Raptors: Returning the Egg"" includes an interview, a production plate of the scene without CGI, and then the final shot adding CGI raptors to a shot that already had a puppet raptor to one side. All of this can be viewed individually or via the ""Play All"" function.

Original Feature: Muscle Simulation [2001] [480i] Beginning with an introduction, this section focuses on the addition of simulated muscles to the wireframes and models of dinosaurs, thus making their movements more lifelike. The introduction is followed by a demonstration of the technique. Each part of the section can be viewed individually or via the ""Play All"" function.

Original Feature: Compositing [2001] [480i] The final subsection here covers the work of combining a finished CGI element with live action to make it appear that the CGI creature is actually in the room with the characters. A definition is provided, followed by a demonstration. Each part of this section can be viewed individually or via the ""Play All"" function.

Original Feature: Dinosaur Turntables [2001] [480i] [6:23] This is a collection of rotating views of the various dinosaurs seen in the film: ""Corythosaurus,"" ""Parasaurolophus,"" ""Brachiosaurus,"" ""Velociraptor (Male),"" ""Ankylosaurus"" (not the Crichton variety), ""Stegosaurus,"" ""Triceratops,"" ""Pteranodon (Baby and Adult),"" ""Compsognathus,"" ""Billy Brennan"" (a model of Allesandro Nivola for his maiden flight shot) and ""Spinosaurus."" These can each be viewed on their own or via the ""Play All"" function.

Original Feature: Storyboards to Final Feature Comparison [2001] [480i] [6:08] Three storyboard assemblies are presented here, each time in combination with the actual film footage of that part of the relevant sequence. The three pieces are ""The Lab"", ""The Aviary"" and ""The Boat Attack"". Each can be viewed individually or via the ""Play All"" function.

Original Feature: Production Photographs [2001] [480i] [2:50] This is a series of photographs taken during the production of the film.

Theatrical Trailer [2001] [480i] [1:16] The film's Original Theatrical Trailer is carried over from the earlier inferior NTSC DVD.

BD-Live: The more general BD-Live screen is accessible via the menu, which makes various online materials available, including tickers, trailers and special events.

My Scenes: The usual bookmarking feature is included here.

D-BOX: D-Box functionality is available for those home theatre enthusiasts who have the proper equipment.

Finally, `Jurassic Park III' is not quite as good as the first but on the whole a lot better than `Jurassic Park 2.' It's also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That's basically `Jurassic Park III' in a nutshell. It's not necessarily a great film, but it sure has its moments, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn't inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. It's great to see Sam Neill return as Dr. Alan Grant and same goes for Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler (although here role is pretty small but yet important) Alessandro Nivola is a great addition to the cast as Billy Brennan. The other characters are more for the comedy elements which works pretty well. So my conclusion: An entertaining film that is good for a few laughs and a good action packed film with some nice scene's and better than ever special effects for the dinosaurs and now it is complete, that I now have the Jurassic Park Trilogy and now I am a happy bunny and so good to add this 3rd film to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

I do wish Michael Jeter had had a bigger role.  He's was an under-rated, GREAT actor, and could have done more great things.  The film was better, in my opinion, than the second Jurassic Park film.  But how can you go wrong with the great Sam Neill and William H. Macy?",1373587200,,439,4.425
1295689,4,B00003CXXR,"Rental so this is a rating of the movie itself, not the DVD or Blu-ray product.

1295691,3,B00003CXXR,"The story line for this third installment in the Jurassic Park franchise is a bit forced.  It is still a fun movie with dinosaurs popping out and attacking people.  But, as is the formula for a third action/adventure movie, the monsters have to get smarter.  The way this happens is a bit of a departure from the ideas of the previous two films.  And, while it was fun to see dinosaurs that had not been in the other two films, I find it hard to believe that a hundred people who explored the island in the previous film, wouldn't have found any evidence of these new creatures.",1371513600,,578,4.373831775700935
1295692,5,B00003CXXR,"I think everyone's seen Jurassic Park so a review isn't really necessary but there's a lot of scary dinosaurs that chase people, lots of fun.

1295693,5,B00003CXXR,I have seen this more than once but like it each time. I am sensitive to people getting eaten by dinosaurs so it was a bit violent for me the first time. There is well-timed subtle humor that moderates the intensity of impending danger.,1369699200,,236,4.386363636363637
1295694,5,B00003CXXR,I bought this movie because it came in Blu Ray finally. I have not watched it yet but I know the addition of Blu Ray will add to it. I saw the original and it is so good. Can't wait to see it in Blu Ray.,1369440000,,203,3.4347826086956523

1295747,4,B00003CXXR,"Brevity is the hallmark of this third addition to the Jurassic Park series.  (Part three is just a little over 90 minutes.)  The story is compact, involving a rescue mission (yes, another child in jeopardy).  A desperate couple procures the assistance of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), under false pretenses (basically, they kidnap him).  He's under the impression they're on a sightseeing trip over Isla Soma.  Imagine everyone's surprise when they crash.  After that, there's a lot of beasties to contend with, danger lurks everywhere, things don't go as planned, not everyone who stepped foot onto the island makes it back off again.  William H.  Macy is great as the desperate father.  Michael Jeter is fun as the sardonic pilot.  Alessandro Nivola does a good job as Dr. Grant's enthusiastic student with a fondness for eggs.  Laura Dern puts in a brief but important appearance.  The only discordant note comes from Tea Leoni as the missing boy's mother; she is in equal measure shrill and insufferable.  Otherwise, a perfectly acceptable sequel.  Love the new dinosaurs.  Considering the ending, I had great hopes for a fourth installment (that never came).  Oh well.

I was hoping that the 3rd movie in the series would do better but neverthless I set my expectation extremely low.  Despite my low expectation, this movie still shocked me.  It's hard to point to one obvious thing that made this movie unwatchable.  The plot was too simple and none of the characters was remotely likeable.  The big fight between T-Rex and Spinosaurus happened at the beginning which was odd.  It should have been reserved for later.

1295825,1,B00003CXXR,"This movie is terrible. It does no justice to the original film. Lost World was a much better film than JP 3, it is even comparable to the original film. Up until the disastrous Hollywood ""let's have dinosaurs in California"" scene and the awkward news cast at the end of the film.
  Well this film is a 92 minute extension of that disastrous Lost World ending. Most of the acting in this film is so over done a that a burnt steak look rare. The CGI is also very bad. Jurassic Park was made in 1993 and the CGI in that film still ranks among the best. The shading and textures in that film are some of most realistic out there even still. What a great accomplishment in the early 90's. Jurassic Park III just does this series an injustice. The story line had some real potential; but for some reason this story translated from script to film all wrong and it mutated into something unexpected. When watching this movie, it leaves an empty feeling and cheap taste. Many scenes were just wrong or dumb. How could the sound of a phone inside a Spinosaurus echo throughout a forest? The ending raptor scene just not a good logical climatic ending made me feel like ""that was it?"" For 93 million dollar movie it could have been much better.",1365552000,2,1234,4.407894736842105

1295887,3,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park III"" is a decent 2001 sequel, marginally better than 1997's ""The Lost World."" It has a been-there-seen-that feel and lacks the huge suspense build-up of the 1993 original. Whereas ""Jurassic Park"" took a whole hour to get to the dino-action, this second sequel jumps to it in the first 15 minutes with a huge fight between a spinosaurus and a t-rex. Of course the former beats the latter to show the audience who's the baddest mofo on the island. (Incidentally, one dinosaur expert pointed out that, although the spino is larger than the t-rex, its head and maw aren't. In fact, the more slender and crocodilian shape of its head would make it virtually impossible to do what it does to the t-rex. Besides, the spino was basically a fish-eater).

In addition to the spinosaurus, we are treated to a good pteranodon scene and another velociraptor sequence (but nowhere near as good as the original), not to mention brief scenes with brachiosaures and anklyosaures.

The best part of the story is the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Grant and Laura Dern looks great in a cameo part, but the rest of the characters are weak and forgettable. In fact, the story is merely a clothesline that links the many dinosaur attack scenes in the jungle.

At only 1 hour and 24 minutes (or thereabouts) before the credits role this is not a deep story with fleshed-out characters - flesh-eaten, maybe, but not fleshed-out. If you thought the original film had a weak story and characters, double that here. But the dinosaurs look great and the action sequences are thrilling. These may be worth the price of admission for some but, at the end of the day, ""Jurassic Park III"" is just really forgettable.

as much as i love Speilberg I do believe he destroyed what was a great book in the Lost World deciding to go with improved special effects due to upgrades in technology hence bringing TRex to San Diego wich never happened in Micheal Crichton's lost world

Sam Neil returns for the 3rd as Dr Allen Grant to lead an expedition he never knew he was going to lead to find a lost boy and the story is back where it belongs, a story of survival on an island of deadly monsters.
The big monster T-rex from the previous movies is nothing compared to the new Spinosaurus and this statement is made very early on when it kills the T-rex.
 Some of the behavior from the people in this movie is a little weird and stupid and most likely a result of the original script being torn up 5 weeks before they commenced filming, though i don't think that is a great excuse to have everyone running around yelling out for others.
 The action comes quick and regually and that is the strengh of this chapter and is pretty suspenseful and believable(if there was an island full of dinosaurs).
The bluray tranfer is spectacular and this is easily the most visually stunning and believable of all 3 movies, the only scene that looked fake was the opening parasailing scene wich is obviously a green screen.

1295955,4,B00003CXXR,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  Jurassic Park III (hereafter JPIII) is essentially JPI or JPII without the excessive environmental, industrial, and genetic ethical moralizing.  JPIII is simply content to pit humans vs. dinosaurs as the humans seek to escape the dinosaur domain alive, and does so, as I said in the title, efficiently, confidently, and entertainingly.  Unlike the first sequel, which gave us the brave but bemused and not dinosaur-savvy Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) JPIII has the good sense to reintroduce rugged, resourceful, Indiana-Jones-like paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant in a latest attempt to save someone from dinosaur-infested Isla Sorna.  That someone is resourceful, plucky 12-year old survivalist Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), stranded by a parasailing mishap.  Eric is certainly a refreshing improvement upon the first sequel's whiny, peevish Kelly (Vanessa Chester). A third plus, at least initially, is Dr. Grant's able, young, handsome graduate student assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola), who comes along for the rescue attempt.

  Somewhat unfortunately, JPIII counterbalances these competent characters with Eric's nondescript parents: Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) who poses as a wealthy businessman willing to subsidize Dr. Grant's research in exchange for his son's rescue, and Amanda Kirby (Ta Leoni), Paul's tenderfoot ex-wife.  Both participate in the rescue, even after Paul reveals he is merely a hardware store owner, and Dr. Grant exasperatedly punches him for the hoax.

  Off the quartet goes to Isla Sorna, where they are, naturally, stranded when a gigantic carnivorous Spinosaurus dismantles their aircraft and slays the mercenaries accompanying the group for protection.  Despite their encounters with the Spinosaurus and T-rex, the latter which is killed in a vicious knockdown battle, the quartet becomes a quintet when they find Eric quite alive and quite well near an enormous aviary.  The Spinosaurus was the first new angle in JPIII, the second is the eventual discovery of towering winged Pteranodons nesting within the aviary.  The Pteranodons chase them as well.  The group's progress is impeded by Eric's out-of-their-element parents, and, surprisingly, by Billy's appropriation of velociraptor eggs in a misguided attempt to fund Dr. Grant's research. Dr. Grant discovers the theft and severely chides Billy as no better than an avaricious corporate suit.  Billy redeems himself by using a parasail to save Eric from a pteranodon's clutches and disappearing into a stream.  The remaining group drive off the attacking Spinosaur with a crane and a boat fire, escape a surrounding pack of velociraptors by communicating with a shell that simulates their cries and giving back their eggs, and manage to contact Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) with an elusive cell phone for help in getting off the island.  They get off the island, find Billy injured but safe, and see the freed pteranodons fly off the island for a possible third sequel.

  I liked JPIII because it is a stripped-down, just-long-enough, straightforward dinosaur adventure.  Furthermore, we learn more about more dinosaurs (carnivores and herbivores) and realize they are far more than villains that chase and eat people.  Also, the characters, even Eric's stereotypically clueless parents, test their mettle and will for survival and eventually earn our respect.  Finally, the CGI beasties are as awe-inspiring as ever and advance in our estimation because of Dr. Grant's scholarly admiration of them.  One can find lapses in JPIII, such as the T-Rex's willingness to leave the carcass it's feeding on to chase little humans, and a 40-pound pteranodon's questionable ability to pick up an 80-pound kid (besides pteranodons are fish-eaters).  Nevertheless, JPIII is a thrilling, suspenseful ride (especially the sequence when Dr. Grant desperately calls Ellie on the slippery cell phone, gets her 3-year old son instead, and tries to get the Barney-distracted child to get mommy on the line). And yes, it's much better and more intelligent than The Lost World, and on a par with the first Jurassic Park.

P.S.:  After three ""Jurassic Park"" movies, what's left for the putative third sequel to cover?  Okay, we have the escaped pteranodons.  But is that enough?  All I can think of is that unscrupulous InGen scientists somehow obtain the dinosaur zygotes from the first movie, perform some cross-breeding on the mainland, and create new dinosaur hybrids, including humanoid dinosaurs (from the velociraptor embryos).",1338422400,,4553,5.4756446991404015
1295956,1,B00003CXXR,"This was simply a disaster waiting to happen. Sam Neill, former star of JP1, and William Macy, who only a few years earlier played a major character in Fargo, couldn't rescue this film. It was simply bad to the bone! It's rmoured that JP4 is being considered. I hope that they come to their senses and dump the project. You would need a really strong script, a good cast and good direction.

1295957,4,B00003CXXR,"This film is far below Jurassic Park but well above The Lost World (Jurassic Park II). It provides a decent story and set of characters as well as excellent dinosaurs to entertain the new viewer of Jurassic Park. Those who have seen the justifiably successful original JP will find some pleasure, as well, although much diluted from the original. Lost World is even more a film for newcomers only. For these latter viewers, probably the improvement in JP3 will make this reasonably good entertainment, For some reason, not made clear, a man and boy are hang-gliding (I think it is called) near an isolated island, quarantined by the owning country. They run into trouble and the last we see of them is their descent toward the island. A short while later, a noted paleontologist and his chief student assistant are inveigled into serving as  an expert guide to a man and wife who have permission to fly over this quarantined island at a sufficiently low level to see the animals. During that trip, they run into trouble and are forced to land. The rest you can guess in general terms. The plot is ancient, some talented actors do as good a job as can be done with their roles, the pre-historic animals are excellent although none comes close to having the personality of King Kong, and there are some good escape from threat scenes. Nothing at all novel, but, nonetheless probably quite enjoyable for children and modestly engaging for adults.",1335571200,,1443,4.772
1295958,4,B00003CXXR,"Steven Spielberg does himself a favor by relinquishing the director duties after the letdown of ""The Lost World"" sequel.  Fort Worth native Joe Johnston (""Captain America: The First Avenger"") takes over and brings back a bit of the wonder of the original.  Even Alexander Payne who directed acclaimed films like ""The Descendants"" and ""Sideways"" gets involved as a co-writer.

In this episode we find a separated couple (Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) hiring Alan Grant (returning Sam Neill) to take them to Site B on an island near Costa Rica.  This of course was the hatching ground for the various prehistoric animals that was abandon years earlier.  Their hidden agenda is actually a rescue mission to retrieve their teenage son (always must have a teen) played by Trevor Morgan.  Eric (Morgan) doesn't do high flying gymnastics like Kelly did in the previous sequel but it's pretty clear he is a self sufficient adventurer.  He and his mom's boyfriend manage to parachute onto the dino infested island without an easy path to escape.

The filmmakers do a few things right in this iteration.  With the various plot points pretty much used up they keep the length at a tidy 92 minutes.  Instead of the usual alpha-dino T-Rex as the ultimate eating machine, we get an even bigger and meaner Spinosaurus that eats planes as well as humans.  Even better, when a T-Rex does stumble upon the scene, the Spinosaurus shows him who the real king is. Best of all is that the cast is kept small, leaving out the multitudes of testosterone ladled mercenaries we got in part II.  Well that is, until the final ridiculous scene.  At least we don't get transported to the U. S. with another King Kong-like exhibit. As usual the real stars here are the dinosaurs; especially the Velociraptors who we now know are intelligent hunters with communication skills.  Part III isn't nearly as good as the original ""Jurassic Park,"" but it does improve on the second and it has the best looking dinosaurs around.

If you are a real fan of this franchise, the Blu ray version is a nice step up.  It is only available as I write this in the ""Ultimate Trilogy"" version, but it has a spectacular looking 1080p transfer and a thunderous DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  It is a nice package.",1335484800,2,2277,4.753180661577608
1295959,4,B00003CXXR,"I read the book which the vast majority of the reviewers did not. The first movie incorporated some of the storyline and added new material. This third movie included some of the beginning of the book that was left out of the first movie. Again new material was added which changed the storyline.

If I ignored the book and just rated the movie for its storyline, it was very entertaining. However I can only give it 4 stars because several scenes were just overdramatized. Had the first movie stuck closer to the book, it would have been even better. But what I missed in the first movie was for the most part included in this one so that is why it was satisfying to me. Many of the negative reviewers did not know about this splitting up of the book's story and so did not understand the significance of what they were viewing.",1332460800,,829,4.4183006535947715
1295960,3,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park III should have been an exceptional movie. It had most of the cards in its hands; good actors, great special effects. The story undid it.

The good parts first. Jurassic Park III looks great, that's for certain. The 3D dinosaurs by Industrial Light and Magic are incredibly lifelike and fearsome. The 3D animation is incredible. The Spinosaurus is an amazing, menacing villain with a spine-tingling presence, quickly demonstrated when he disposes of the menacing Tyrannosaurus Rex with relative ease. The cinematography is A+ as well, with sweeping vistas contrasted by lush, claustrophobic greens in the midst of the jungle. Jurassic Park III scores highly in the visual department.

Even though the movie looks great, though, it has absolutely no substance. The central story is very flat and poor. Unlike the other two movies, where science really was at the forefront, here it's rather annoyingly one-dimensional. A kid gets stranded on Isla Sornar AKA Site B on an illegal parasailing trip. How stupid do you have to be to do that? His divorced parents trick Alan Grant into taking them there to save him, where they promptly get stranded and at the mercy of the deadly gang of dinosaurs.

The problem is, it's extremely one-dimensional, and not in the fun way. Sam Neill reprises his role as Alan Grant, but he has very little to work with. Nothing is resolved at the end, either. There is no payoff at all to the depressing setup with Alan's present life, not even partly (and having him broken up with Ellie is very out of character for them both). In spite of bouts of fierce energy, the movie's atmosphere is tired and flat.

The danger to the characters could've been much stronger if the movie'd dared to kill off some more of its characters. The script undermines the Spinosaurus's ferocity every time, making him barely feel like he's trying to catch the heroes. The T-Rex in the previous two movies was a constant threat, and fatalities were just frequent enough (and usually more) to remind us of that. Spinosaurus is very fearsome at the start of the movie but then puts on more of a show than an effort. One moment, we see him smashing through a solid steel fence in a great display of passion for the hunt. The next (literally), he can't even smash through a steel door. That's what I call a cop-out. Spinosaurus, buddy, you were doing so great!

The movie isn't brave enough to be a mindless killfest or polished enough to be a satisfying story, making the dinosaur encounters, thrilling though they are, feel very anticlimatic. There is a particular shot where the characters fall, inside a damaged plane, and all yell while looking directly at the camera. It was akin to something from a full-on comedy, not a survival thriller.

With a better story and script, JP3 could've been the movie it deserved to be.",1328745600,3,2844,4.793877551020408
1295961,2,B00003CXXR,"This movie lost me at around 7 minutes, with all the nonsensical talk of 'resonating chamber' and how Dr. Grant concludes the velociraptor was smarter than modern dolphins and primates. Considering how inaccurately the first film portrayed 'velociraptor', which more closely resembled a lizard-skinned Deinonychus or Utahraptor (god what a stupid name), this already was too much for me. I can accept the first film's explanation that the genetic code was modified with amphibian DNA, giving the lizard-like appearance to all, perhaps even mutating their size, but for this third film to already be taking fringe theories, such as pack-hunting raptors, and going even further to suggest that they were super intelligent and even talked to one another is just silly and unnecessary. Anyway, I had a major hang-up with how this film started out this way. The dialogue is also, for the most part, weak and uninteresting. Also, they talk about the dinosaurs as if a few fossils explains everything about their behavior and points to them and says ""look you can see the alpha male grazing there"". How would he know? All of the artistic renderings we have are best-guess speculation, so how could he possibly identify anything about a bunch of mutant dinosaurs? Also, they call Cooper a professional, but he runs onto the runway as they are taking off and just stands there in the open shedding a tear until the dinosaur eats him and causes the plane to crash. How is that professional? What is professional is hiding in cover (eg. bushes). Stupid plot. I hate to say it but the effects don't seem to be very consistent, or as good overall, as the original. It's not very scary either, more comical. The original film was actually pretty creepy and scary in parts. This one gets going Michael Bay style and you never really care. Well, I didn't. Some of the composite shots look really bad, in fact. When the two big dinosaurs are fighting (not even halfway into the film), I think the original stop motion fight in King Kong was more realistic and compelling. This just looks like something from a current-gen computer game and almost worse in fact. In general, I really like Ta Leoni, but here in this movie she comes off as annoying, about as much of a brainless blond as you could ask for, and always endangering the party with her noise. I'd sure like to know how you hot-wire a camcorder with a D-cell flashlight. I also knew it was a nest way before the camera even showed it, although true, I didn't guess that there were MULTIPLE nests, but I guess I should have seen that coming as well. Guess what I can also guess? That they are raptor eggs. Lets see if I'm right again.... haha yup, as soon as I hit play Grant whispers ""raptor"". When a movie is this predictable you know it's bad.

I'm still watching, but I would not recommend this film just because it's about as dumb as they come. Actually, no, movies CAN be worse than this, but it's still not worth keeping on MY shelf. I'll just stick to the original, thanks.",1324857600,,3023,4.671669793621013

1295994,1,B00003CXXR,"What happens when you put a group of second-rate filmmakers together on an island, give them an enormous budget, and provide them with one of the most valuable film franchises of all time? You realize just how brilliant Steven Spielberg is.

""Jurassic Park III"" is simply a pointless movie that never should have been made. The film simply reeks of a cheap sequel. The basic plot tells of a couple who tricks Dr. Alan Grant to take them into Jurassic Park after their son is lost on the island while parasailing. Predictably, all hell breaks loose as the dinosaurs continue to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, in all of this havoc there is not a single moment of decent dialogue, acting, directing, or special effects. The filmmakers seem to have interpreted the original ""Jurassic Park"" as a horror film, and treat this movie as such. Characters die in a timely and organized fashion, characters attempt to separate in order to be ""more effective,"" and so forth. The original ""Jurassic Park"" was not a horror film, and this movie should not have been treated as such.

I doubt that many people had high expectations for ""Jurassic Park III"" as a good film. Most probably thought the movie would simply be an enjoyable escape for an hour and a half with great special effects and a few memorable scenes. Yet somehow, even with a budget of approximately ninety million dollars, the movie's special effects were terrible. In the opening scene, I heard a kid behind me who couldn't have been older than eight turn to his mom and say ""Mommy, that looks so fake."" If the special effects couldn't even make a child believe, how are they supposed to convince the rest of the public? Another huge weakness in this movie is the timing. One thing that made the original ""Jurassic Park"" great was the memorable scenes. I can instantly recall great scenes from the movie, such as the T-Rex chasing the Jeep at night, the young boy climbing the electric fence and getting electrocuted, and so forth. ""Jurassic Park III"" doesn't have any sense of timing, and as a result the film just feels like a bunch of scenes that bleed into each other without any rhyme or reason. A few moments in the movie could have actually been memorable scenes had they been timed correctly, but instead they are easily discarded and thought of as a joke. The lack of special effects and memorable scenes kills the possibility of ""Jurassic Park III"" even being an enjoyable excursion.

Yet through all the bad acting, poor writing, and mindless directing, the biggest weakness in the film is not as obvious. The filmmakers failed to realize what the original ""Jurassic Park"" was about. It was not simply a horror or action film in which the protagonists ran away from scary beasts. The film was an examination of man's role in nature and of how we view ourselves as the mighty rulers of the universe. While there were exciting chase scenes and great special effects, those were not the theme of the film. ""Jurassic Park III"" forgets all of this, and even occasionally mocks these themes in the original. If you took these themes away from the original film, all you would have had left would be a hollow horror film with great special effects. ""Jurassic Park III"" is simply a hollow horror film with mediocre special effects. ""Jurassic Park"" is a story about man; ""Jurassic Park III"" is a story about dinosaurs. That is the primary difference between the two films.

One would have thought that with the budget and the resources the filmmakers had, they could have produced a better movie than ""Jurassic Park III."" Instead, the movie is a reminder of ""Jaws,"" another amazing Spielberg film that had sequels made by different directors that were subsequently mindless waste. While ""Jurassic Park II"" was not a great film by any means, it at least understood the original and tried to carry on it's themes. ""Jurassic Park III"" does none of that, and as a result is simply rubbish that should definitely be avoided.",1309305600,2,3970,4.757619738751814

Spinosaurs was supposed to eat fish because of his small weak jaws.

I tried to like it but I have to say the only good thing about this one was Sam Neill's return as Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern's cameo.  The premise of the story is that a boy and his mom's boyfriend are parasailing near Isla Sorna when they crash, then the parents of said boy go to Dr. Grant and trick him into going to Isla Sorna.  The story itself was cheesy but what made it worse was the whole raptors are super intelligent (and I mean ridiculously intelligent) granted we knew Raptors were smart in the first couple films but now they have their own speech and...yeah it's...a little much.  Another thing a lot of this movie is just a compliation of left overs from the first book (i.e. the river boat, the bird cage.)  I could go on but my advice is if you enjoy the first couple films steer clear of this one.  (Not that I really enjoyed the Lost World that much.)",1289606400,,981,4.27027027027027
1295998,3,B00003CXXR,"Spielberg bailed. He was too busy bringing AI: Artificial Intelligence to the screen. Joe Johnston, a more than capable director himself, stepped in delivered a decent timewaster, but failed to give us anything new and didn't even bother to attempt an epic.

Above and beyond all things, what cripples Jurassic Park 3 the most is the brief running time. The film fades out at the 84-minute mark, which is just unacceptable. The previous films were epics and both clocked in at over 2 hours. Why on earth did Universal take their biggest franchise at the time and cut it down to this? It beggars belief. The film feels like a TV pilot more than it does a cinematic event.

Strange since the budget was $30 million higher than Jurassic Park in 1993. But the effects have improved drastically in that 8 year gap. I was never too keen or impressed with the CGI in the first film. The dinosaurs just didn't look right, but if you dared to criticize the film at the time you would have been shouted down.

A lot of story concepts came and went before they, unimaginatively, settled on a ""same again"" scenario with yet another extended chase on Isla Sorna. Some of the scenes are even recycled unused sequences that never made the final script edit in the first two. At least they brought back Sam Neill as Alan Grant and had a small role for Laura Dern. William H. Macy provides great support too. It's good to see him do action for a change. And the kid in this one is far, far, far less aggravating than those annoying brats in the original film.

John Williams didn't return, instead leaving the scoring chore Don Davis who made an adequate, if hardly memorable, attempt. All the good stuff is Williams' themes from the other movies. And since he made a few themes for this one I will assume that any noteworthy cues within were actually Williams' contributions, and not Davis', who I have never really liked.

The action IS brilliantly done though, and the Spinosaurus, the new villain is quite scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends! That is my biggest problem with JP3. The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.

I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effect alone.

It's strange how these films are not on Blu Ray yet. Even on DVD the DTS sound design is unbelievably aggressive and powerful. Think of how good it would be in DTS HD-MA. And imagine the dinosaurs in 1080p. Come on Universal, get working on it!",1281139200,4,2611,4.578158458244111

1296022,5,B00003CXXR,I bought this for a 10 year old boy and his anticipation for it to arrive was well worth it.  He loves this movie.  We are going to see Walking With the Dinosaurs so he's been watching it a lot.,1270512000,,194,3.825
1296023,1,B00003CXXR,"Oh I bet I wasn't the only one that was looking forward to this when the trailer came out.  Jurassic Park holds a special place in my heart.  It terrorized me when I was little and now I absolutely adore it.  The first two movies together are a suburb example of CG integrated into the realistic and gritty look of movies made in the mid-90's.  Jurassic Park 3 apparently ignored what had made the first two so good and loses much of that movie magic.

So yes, we're going back to the island.  Sam Neill makes a re-appearance as Alan Grant and is paid to go back to the islands in order to fund his research.  Now first off on a personal note, I HATED how Alan and Ellie didn't end up together.  Call me a snotty romantic, but I loved how in the first movie there wasn't an emphasis on their relationship.  Instead they act like a real compatible couple, understanding each others actions without words or drawn-out speeches.  Right from this first scene I knew the movie was in trouble.

Once at the island they go through the typical dinosaur chases as Alan is led by a married couple looking for their son.  Here's the main problem with this plot line.  There isn't anything particularly 'dinosaur' about these people.  The other movies befitted from having experts as lead characters, allowing for the sorta believable accident of something going wrong.  With normal people the whole affair comes off as a B-list island horror movie.

We see this heavily in the action sequences.  In movies 1 and 2 everyone has at least some sense of what they are doing.  Whether or not they make the right decision is par for the course, but at least the generally know how to the get out.  In Jurassic Park 3 however each dinosaur chase is too-over blown with a de-emphasis on the whole human intelligence.  For example in the kitchen scene of the first movie, everything slows down enough for the audience to grasp exactly how smart the velociraptors are so when Lex and Tim succeed in surviving we are genially moved.  On the flip-side in the Jurassic Park 3, we don't really understand what the significance of that duck-billed T-rex really is.  Alan only briefly mentions it and its action sequences are too fast for us to really get a sense of tension and danger.

So in summary I didn't really like this movie.  Unlike Lost World, this sequel doesn't add anything new to the Jurassic Park universe and we would have been better without it.  As a horror action-movie it was well done, but it just doesn't stand-up to its predecessors.",1264982400,,2530,4.568888888888889

1296026,3,B00003CXXR,"One of the things that drove me up the wall about JURASSIC PARK III was the script's insistence that families--no matter how selfish, stupid and ill-equipped they may be--will always survive.  And because of that dogma, the script loses me and the dinosaurs are not a threat at all.

I could accept the son surviving 8 weeks on the Site B island...but the parents were just useless.  If anyone should've been eaten by the big dinosaurs, it was the obnoxious mother yelling her son's name all over an island crawling with prehistoric predators (shouting with a bullhorn at one point!).  Does she get killed?  Not a chance!  The heavily-armed mercenaries get it one by one...but not the loud mother crashing through the brush.  You just know that no harm will ever come to certain characters in this movie...so the dinosaurs don't become a threat after the last mercenary is killed and eaten.

No plot spoilers from me: This time we have paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from JP1) trying to keep a poorly prepared group alive on beautiful but, predictably, dinosaur infested island. The actors have a great chemistry that works well on screen. There are some very good character based plot twists and even a few dinosaur twists as well.

Like in JP1, there is a good amount of subtle humor added in the movie. This really helps to offset the tension created in the intense action sequences. The action and special effects are almost as good as in JP1 and are far better than JP2.

The dinosaurs in JP3 are much more fleshed out this time, with more advanced ""personalities"" and frighteningly realistic interaction with the environment. We also see a few ""new"" dino types, including the fearsome spinosaurus and flying pteranodons (a great scene, really well done on all levels).

This is a better than average sequel that my whole family enjoyed!

1296111,5,B00003CXXR,"This is my favorite of the Jurassic Park movies, which is unusual in that it is a sequel.
Great story line, great acting and believable characters with enough depth to keep you involved and in suspense... and the dinos are excellently done.
Spinosaurus is of course hands down the star of the show, and perhaps I'm a bit biased since its just a really cool animal to watch.

I'll give it five stars although I do have to wonder why this poor Spino animal is so bound and determined to get at these guys, who can't present much of a meal compared to the other fare on the island (not to mention still hungry after eating a 50 ton Tyrannosaurus early in the movie, being shot at, at and at one point even doused in alcohol and burned alive).  But, hey.

I'm also slightly irritated by the fact that all the Jurassic Park dinos in all the movies have identical butts sticking way up in the air and synchronized twiddly tails, they look like computer point and click copies of each other in large groups.

I have to ask generally:  Why are all the two legged dinosaurs always stooped so low, hunched like old ladies with their tails higher their heads?
Balance-schmalance.  Surely if an animal learns to walk on two legs, its so that it can walk around with its head up high and have a good view around.....not much use walking on two legs and being stooped in the exact same four-leg position, way down at park human-grabbing height.

Did it equal the first? No, of course not. The original story was easily the best of the three, but I found this an enjoyable movie and far better than what I had been led to believe.

The filmmakers were smart in making this a short film. People had seen plenty of the dinosaurs by now so let's no overdo it...and they didn't with an film just under an hour-and-a-half (not including the final credits.).

That made this short-and-sweet. We saw some new reptiles, had a few scares, enjoyed the beautiful jungle scenery (filmed in Hawaii) and - bang - it's over. The characters were fine, nobody totally annoying as in the second film. The lulls featured a family getting back together and finding their missing teen. Nothing wrong with that.

1296119,4,B00003CXXR,"I found the story to JP3 to be much simpler than the first two films.  Both of the other JP's incorporated a business aspect to the films with the amusement park in the first, and the company INGEN in the 2nd, on top of the action, scares and magnificent creatures.  The third film seems to stay much simpler, with the story coming down to nothing much more than a rescue operation of a 12 year old boy on the site B-island (the island from the Lost World).  While the plot Held up for what it was, its mostly a good popcorn movie that does keep you on edge with its action.

The slightly less than 90 minute run was actually a good length for JP3, since it didn't seem like the story would have been able to expand to two hours based on what was given.  The 90 minute run does establish some development between characters as well as some thought and feelings about the sensitive subject of these modern day dinosaurs,but most of the time is dedicated to lots of terrific thrills and action.  Most of the familiar dinos return such as the T-Rex and your loveable Raptors.  The T-Rex however, is given much less screentime in this film, as he is actually less superior to the new Spinosaurus (proven in a showdown between the two creatures) who gets plenty of scenes throughout the movie.  The raptors get their fare share of time too, though this time its not all about hunting and preying, they actually communicate now and have strategies.  In other words, they've gotten smarter since the last film.

The cast actually held together well, and clicked a little more than the last film.  The biggest treats are the return of two main characters from the first JP - Alan and Ellie, both played by the same actors - Sam Neil and Laura Dern.  Ellie doesn't get nearly as much screentime in JP3, but Alan is basically back as the main character.  No Jeff Goldblum this time though.

I'd say the action was pretty good overall, but I enjoyed the T-Rex and Raptor scenes more from the first two films.  The Spinosaurus did add a lot to JP3 though, and so did the dinobirds, called Pterosaurs.  There is enough action to keep things exciting from beginning to end, and the effects as always, were wonderful.

JP3 keeps the series going, and going smoothly instead of brining a good franchise to a pitiful ending.

1296179,1,B00003CXXR,"Now I absolutely love `Jurassic Park' and even though it falters in areas I firmly defend `The Lost World' but truthfully there is nothing I can say to defend the mess that is `Jurassic Park III'.  Sadly this film is lacking in every area, from script to acting to (god forbid) special effects, which actually look like they have gotten worse as apposed to improving since the first installment.  From the moment Grant dreams of the raptor on the plane I knew that I was in for a disappointment, but it wasn't until actor Trevor Morgan threw his first smoke bomb that I realized just what a GIANT disappointment this film was going to prove to be.

`Jurassic Park III' (they didn't even come up with a catchy name for it) reacquaints us with paleontologist Alan Grant.  Grant is approached by the Kirby's who want him to escort them to Isla Sorna, yet another island infested with dinosaurs.  They want his expertise as they `fly' over the island, someone to point out the sights, but that isn't their real intentions at all.  No, they intend to land the plane, something Grant did not sign up for, and this sends the group into a dangerous journey to find and rescue the Kirby's young son who happened to crash land on the island in the first few moments of the film.

I'm getting a headache just thinking about reviewing this mess of a film.  The problem is that the script is so haphazard, so NOT thought through at all.  To think that this young kid would survive on his own, let alone defend himself and others against hunting machines such as raptors is beyond ridiculous.  The acting is horrendous.  I loved Sam Neil in the first film but you can tell that he is board with this venture.  Tea Leoni and William H. Macy must have been mentality unstable when they signed on to do this film, it is so beneath them.  Sadly, what should have been the best part of the movie was the worst.  Yes, the god AWFUL special effects make this the worst installment of the `Jurassic Park' franchise.  The scene where the newer, bigger dinosaur rolls over the plane is enough to make you want to vomit.

So, it is clear that I loathe this film.  It is a pointless dip in the cash cow that was `Jurassic Park' that proved to be a nauseating cinematic experience.  I'll never, I repeat NEVER, watch this film again and I advise any who have not seen it to stay far, far away.  If you have seen it, well then I feel your pain.",1199404800,2,2416,4.413092550790068

The plane crashes and Alan finds himself back in the same situation he's been trying so hard to forget: being trapped in Jurassic Park.

Sam Neill as Alan Grant is one of my favorite performances ever. There's such an air of seriousness and intensity that Sam brings to the role every time. He can be funny, sure, but his character presentation commands a respect from his fellow actors that you don't see that often in film.

William H. Macy, another favorite of mine, plays Paul Kirby, the bumbling yet-trying-to-be-cool dad. Terrific. He was serious, clumsy, just fantastic. Every film Macy's in has never let me down and this movie delivers a wonderful Macy performance. There's something about the pacing of his line delivery that gets to me, too. It's a guy who's insecure but tries his best to put a confident spin on things no matter what.

The dinosaurs, as always, look real. They're huge, they're scary, they're loud. The only problem with these Jurassic sequels is the dinosaurs aren't new and terrifying anymore. They were in the first movie, not so much now. However, there are a few dino attacks in Jurassic Park 3 that weren't in the others, making the viewing of this film worthwhile.

Michael Jeter (The Green Mile), Laura Dern (Jurassic Park), John Diehl (Pearl Harbor) and Ta Leoni (A League of Their Own) also star.

1296185,5,B00003CXXR,"It is rare for a sequel to surpass an original, and that is even less likely the more numbers you add to it.  This movie is not as good as the original, but it is still very enjoyable.

The original was a Spielberg film based on a Crichton novel.  While Spielberg's influence is still there, he allowed Joe Johnston to take his place in the director's chair.  The credits state that it features characters created by Crichton, but unlike the first two, it is not based on Crichton's work.

There are changes to make it fresher.  The raptors have a makeover, the Pteradactyls (which were in the original novel) make a movie debut, and the spinosaurus steals the show.  Additionally, my favorite dinosaur, the ankylosaurus, makes a couple of cameos, though they have no role in the story.

The movie's hero, Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) was consipiously absent from ""The Lost World"", with the cynical Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) taking his place.  Malcolm and John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) are missing from this movie, while Grant and his then girl-friend and still good friend (Laura Dern) return in this installment.

Why do I like this picture the best of the three?  Because of the human story.  Like the original and unlike ""The Lost World"", the characters stand their own in a world of special effects dinosaurs.  The story of this movie deals with friendships and respect.  It includes the healing of a family.  I felt good emotionally when the closing credits started, as well as being wow-ed by the technology and visual images.

Like the first movie, this would be a good one to have a discussion after.  In this case, though, the discussion can move to friendships and family, rather than philosophical topics.",1164326400,,1717,4.805460750853243

That magic feeling, of course, would not last for long, because of the dearth of CGI-enhanced films that followed the film's blazing run in theaters. ""Jurassic Park 3"", however, is definately an improvement over the second film in the series,""The Lost World"", for a few good reasons: first, the film is short and to the point. It's basically a thrill ride to the end. Second, the special effects are just that: special. The dinosaurs are jaw-dropping in their appearance, making some inconsistancies with the other films just a bit more palatable. And third, although I enjoyed the rather Godzilla-like T-Rex attack on San Diego, it was really out of place in the second film, and there was nothing like that in this one. It was good to see Sam Neil back, and Laura Dern, also, if only in a small cameo-type role.

1296199,5,B00003CXXR,"The first Jurassic Park was the best, but I still like some things about Jurassic Park III better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first Jurassic Park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, Gladiator 2000, Godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic Park III had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt. 3 were real. Special effects expert Stan Winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt. 3. The raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two Jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt. 3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,Jurassic Park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised Stan Winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt. 3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special effects of not only Jurassic Park III, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt. 3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt II. Sam Neil really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the Jurassic Park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic Park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy Jurrasic Park pt. 3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be Citizen Kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded.

1296200,4,B00003CXXR,"A surprisingly good film considering it is the third in the series, Jurassic Park III, provides another take on the well known by now paleontologist and of course... the dinosaurs!  When Alan Grant is contacted by a wealthy couple to act as a guide on an aerial tour over the restricted island of Sorna things are not all that they seem...

Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.

On the negative side, the 11-year old surviving for 8 weeks on Isla Sorna is ridiculous to say the least, not to mention his overly confident attitude throughout the movie!

In addition, Allesandro Nivola's character is not all that interesting and that takes away from the enjoyment.  In the end you kind of wish he hadn't made it...

In short, the plot is average, while the setting, the special effects, and the music are EXCELLENT!

Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching and one to consider adding to your movie collection!",1138060800,3,1035,4.748603351955308
1296201,4,B00003CXXR,"It would be nearly impossible to trump the first Jurassic Park film.  People were blown away by that movie.  The technology was cutting edge and the premise was nearly magical in its element of fantasy.  Making a third installment to the series presents an obvious challenge.  How do you uphold the level of entertainment set by the first two films?  The answer: new dinosaurs...

In this film, we get the addition of a few new dinos.  The Spinosaur, being even bigger and badder than the T-Rex, is the ""guy on the block"" now.  Flying pteranodons are introduced on Isla Sorna, where they were once housed in a huge cage, now left to patrol the skies freely.  The Velociraptors have also gotten an upgrade.  They look a bit more menacing than the Raptors from the original Jurassic Park.  These new additions are what make this film what it is.

The first film was set on lush pastures of modeled prehistoric land.  The setting for this film is far more delapidated.  This is the land the dinosaur rules.  The premise of the film is a bit cheesy, but you barely notice, given the amazing production and spectacle of the film.  Once on the island, all you experience is the thrill of the search and the chase.  The fact that a divorced couple are searching for their wayward child becomes secondary to the dinosaur action that ensues once they arrive.

I knew I would enjoy this movie simply because I love the idea of Jurassic Park, yet I was pleasantly surprised by just how good it turned out to be.

The DVD is bursting with bonus material.  It would take hours to get through it all - but it's well worth it.  There's an extensive ""Making of.."" featurette, a ""New Dinosaurs"" featurette, a tour of the studio in which the dinosaurs were conceived and brought to life, storyboards, DVD-rom options, etc...  The Special Edition certainly does the process of the movie justice, providing deep insight into the production.

Highly recommended.",1137024000,40,1941,4.6943620178041545
1296202,4,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park III"" saves the ""Jurassic Park"" series from sinking into the bloated ""Great movie followed by wretched sequel"" genre.  ""The Lost World"" was such a bad film that I waited for this particular sequel to hit the DVD shelves and satellite TV before watching it.  It strays a little from the original film's formula by dropping the bulk of the suspense and horror as well as running time and dives right into the action sequences with those ever-wonderful lookin' dinosaurs.

In this particular film we are reacquainted with Sam Neill's stellar character, Dr. Grant.  He's conned into going on a ""fly over"" of island B that we saw in ""The Lost World"" with William H. Macy and Tea Leoni.  Their true intentions are to find Leoni's boyfriend (she has had a falling out with Macy, her ex-husband) and her and Macy's son.  Both were lost on a parasailing trip a few weeks earlier.

Once Dr. Grant realizes what is going on, he at first refuses to help them but eventually gives in.  His assistant happens to pick up a raptor egg in hopes of cashing in later.  Big mistake.  What results is everybody's favorite intelligent predators making short work of the search party as they run wildly in an attempt to escape.

We are introduced to pteranodons and a spinosaur.  We also get to catch up with the ol' T-Rex as well.  All of the dinosaurs look wonderful in this film.  The action is very fast-paced and very loud.  Macy and Neill are probably the two best parts of this film as both seem to be enjoying their time on the screen.  Laura Dern pops in for a few seconds in order to reprise her role from the original film and call in a favor for Dr. Grant.

The scenery is captivating at times and is just as beautiful as it was in the first two ""JP"" flicks.  There seems to be a lot more humor in this film and, as stated before, emphasis is put on action and explosions instead of suspense.

I recommend this film as a definite purchase if you enjoyed the original ""JP"" film.  It has a wonderful cast, including the supporting characters, and it is still fun to see the T-Rex and the raptors do their worst onscreen.",1134691200,,2121,4.473958333333333
1296251,2,B00003CXXR,"In Jurassic Park III Sam Neill as Dr. Grant looks tired.  No wonder, this 3rd in the series of Dinosaur experiment gone wrong movies has the look and feel of a film thrown out for public consumption and quick profit.  While big on blood and special effects there is nothing new here.  This film is why people hate sequels.  Raptors, raptors everywhere.  Terradactyls fly off into the sunset at the end of this movie, with glee on the look of the faces of all the main characters.  Considering these creatures were hunting them down, you wonder why?  Its one thing to make a sequel that adds something to the original story line, Jurassic Park III just has nothing to contribute.  The scene with Barney did give one hope that this stinker was almost over.",1133049600,,754,4.574626865671642
1296252,3,B00003CXXR,"I like the thrills and the overall rush you get from the Jurassic Park films thus far, even if none come close to the suspense, and originality of the first film. But can't we come up with a new premise, i mean come on, a lost unknown island in the second movie, where Jeff Goldblum goes to rescue his X wife. And now the third with the same island that Dr. Grant gets conned into landing on from a group of normal suburban tile selling folks, who can't afford to pay him for his duties, but can hire professinals to fly a plain and protect them with guns on the island. Well this premise is more enjoyable than The Lost Worlds at least. I guess all in all i can't complain much, these movies are about Dino-CGI's and being chased and having fun with it, not much else. I just wish when or IF they make number 4 they are a little more clever with how they execute the plot. For instance what ever happen to the Barbasol shaving cream can that went under the mud when Newman got killed in the first film while trying to escape?? Maye we should use that for the next one. So Jurassic Park 3 is more of the same, run, hide, or be eaten.",1131408000,2,1133,4.131221719457014
1296253,4,B00003CXXR,"I like all the Jurassic Park movies, and without question ""The Lost World"" and ""Jurassic Park 3"" can't come close to the original materpiece, which is about 12 years old now, hard to believe!!! In my opinion, I think that this movie is better, than the ""Lost World"" by far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 This movie just doesn't have the same feel as the original, but is obviously the most advanced film, with visual eye candy and plainly breath taking visuals!!! It just seems this film was rushed and could have been better!!! I just don't personaly like this movie as much as the original ""Jurassic Park"" for some reason!!! Well I suppose it doesn't matter because all the films are awesome!!! I will suggest this film for any action fan looking for ""A Thrill Ride!"" or a great movie!!!

 The story take place after the evnts of the two before it!!! The movie kicks off when, Dr. Grant(Sam Niel) and Billy, his young counterpart are asked, by a wealthy couple (William Marcy) and his wife (Tea Leoni) to accompany them on a tour of the dreaded Isla Sorna, Ingen's former breeding ground for prehistoric creatures, and the second sight for the Jurassic Park!!!

 Dr. Grant then discover's that their is more going on than he thought, it turns out that they aren't rich and are looking for their son who dissapered around the area!!! It turns into a struggle between life and deaf, facing clever and deadly Raptors, along with the whole dino infested island!!! Can they survive, and stay in one piece!!!

 The special features are awesome too, which even makes this a better buy, of an already great one!!! This is plainly a great film !!! The movie was straight action from start to finish, which was great and always has you thinking, I wonder ""What Will Happen Next"", wanting more, more action!!! I also like how they featured the raptors more in this film, the raptors are kick @$$,... yeah, I love @$$ kicking action!!! The Teradactols, with the whole bird cage thing were awesome too!!! I also give kudos to some great acting!!!

Overall,  I will give this a 4/5!!! Plainly a great movie, but can't match the greatness of the original ""Jurassic Park"", It just doesn't have the same feel as the other two, but opens up Isla Sorna a new front in The Jurassic Park world!!! Not as good as the original, but kills ""Lost World""!!!

Pros:
-Great visuals, breathtaking eye candy
-Raptors are new and improved
-More straight forward action approach
-Dr. Grant is back in this film
-Great concept, as usual!!!
-Awesome special features
-Terdactols!!!!!!!!

Cons:
-Not the same feel as the first two
-The movie was a little too short

 Unlike, the other two films this is more of a survival thriller,with straight forward action rather than;adventure, guns galore action, and chaos feel that the original and ""Lost World"" had!!! Like I said before, this is a heck of a great movie, it isn't the best in the saga but is worth watching!!! This is overall second best next to the original!!!

I will suggest this to any action fan, or someone looking for a movie filled with thrills and chills!!! Or anybody who likes Jurassic Park, or any kind of sci fi!!!",1123891200,2,3136,4.686703096539162

1296255,4,B00003CXXR,"No, Michael Crichton did not write a book before this movie was made, and it shows.
  This movie was all about action, and there wasn't much science stuff involved. The story is pretty simple, and there were some wacky part in this movie.
  The raptors were radically changed; now they have feathers pointing out of their heads, there heads were a bit longer, and some part of them near their heads is PURPLE AND BLUE. I AM NOT JOKING. It looks dumb, and takes away from the movie. When I saw it, I'm just like, ""What the crap is that??"" Weird.
  Another thing, the second movie was on Isla Sorna, and there was no sightings or mention of a Spinosaurus. Don't get me wrong, the Spinosaurus is my fave dinosaur in the JP series. That just seemed weird.
  All in all, a great movie. A ton of fun, and it rocks. Buy the whole JP series, trust me, you'll like every single one!!!!",1123027200,2,876,4.331288343558282

1296305,3,B00003CXXR,"JP III is a solid action movie with a thin script and more great effects. It was also good to see Sam Neill back as Alan Grant. Dr. Grant is paid by a wealthy couple to join them in a flyover of the island from The Lost World and act as a tour guide. He reluctantly agrees and takes his assistant with him. The couple has lied to him however. They are actually going on a rescue mission. Their 12-year old son was parasailing with his mother's new boyfriend when there was an accident and they crash landed on the island.

There are a few new dinosaurs which make this movie interesting. The Spinosaur, who is bigger and meaner than the T Rex (and in fact takes down a Rex in a great fight sequence) and pterodons who look great gliding through the air. Good parts of the script are the action scenes especially with the Spinosaur and some good humor. Bad parts are that William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are irritating as the divorced couple and the fact that they survive until the end is hard to believe. Harder to believe is that the 12 year old son survives for 8 weeks by himself. The rescue party was down two members ten minutes after landing.

Ignore the script holes and watch the dinosaurs. This is still a pretty good movie.",1121558400,3,1232,4.306034482758621
1296306,3,B00003CXXR,"The first 2 Jurassic Park's were entertaining(even 2, it had its moments) but some would say it was mired by science speak and existence questions(like whether to interfere with creatures lifestyles or just leave them be). The third entry ignores this and basically makes it a big action romp of silly humans being eaten by big dinosaurs. Instead of Steven Spielberg directing, we have his friend Joe Johnston(director of Jumanji and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids).

While parasailing, Eric and his mom's boyfriend are parasailing too close to Isla Sorna, Site B from the 2nd film. They end up being stranded on the island. Eric's parents want to find him but the US Embassy and the Costa Rican governement don't want to help so they enlist Alan Grant, main character from film 1 and his protege Billy. They also bring along 3 mercenaries. They end up crashing on the island and being chased by the Spinosaurus, described as the single largest predator in known history. Not to mention pteryadons and velociraptors.

Despite the CG enhancements, 3 actually has very cheap looking dinos. During a big dino fight in the first half, the dinos come close to the camera and it's obvious CG. There's many shots like that in here. Even though based on recently discovered fossils, the velociraptors actually look tamer here. In the first one, they were fast, big and threatening like you didn't want to cross them. Here they seem like just big lizards.

There is plot holes yes. Someone mentioned the airfield which wasn't in the Lost World. The windows on the car are in the wrong place. There was even supposed to be a gate/fence at the entrance which is missing. The Spinosaurus is never seen or heard in part 2, nor the raptor's ability to vocalize/coordinate. And the birdcage is never seen in 2. In the other ones raptors just snarled, hissed and roared and were downright terrifying. Kind of hard to get scared by things that bark like seals on here. Plus, the food they're eating, is it not over 4 years old?

Despite the more action-y tilt storywise, oddly enough it isn't even gory or menacing. In part 1 you had a man being attacked onscreen, 2 actually but they were obscured, a man being partially bit and waved around, even an arm. Part 2 you get a guy being squished, torn in half and another being eaten but obscured(the video store guy). Here? One gets eaten but the foot obscures the bite, one gets snatched but that's it and another gets his neck snapped. The dinos don't even bother eating, just snap! Even the dialogue ""I think this was Gennaro...I think this was too"" is more gory than anything here.

However, it's still an entertaining B movie despite the fact it isn't suspenseful as the other 2. No T-Rexes outside tents or raptors in the kitchen here. But for a romp, can't go wrong. P.S to the guy who thinks Jeff Goldblum is in this: it's Sam Neill, not Jeff.",1121385600,3,2876,4.653543307086614

PG-13 Moderate violence, mild language and suspense.  It's not terrible like the 2nd one, but it's still not really a family film because it would frighten smaller children, which is probably the main reason why they rated it PG-13.

1296309,4,B00003CXXR,"As in so many cases, a great movie comes out and the sequel is just mediocre. Then a third sequel comes along and it too is a great movie. This is yet another example of that phenomenon.  JURASSIC PARK III is a good movie. I don't think it is a good as the first but it is certainly better than the second and the dinosaur footage might well be considered the best yet.

This is a straight adventure/rescue story. Sam Neil is hoodwinked into returning to the isle of dinosaurs to act as a ""tour guide"". He is only supposed to narrate what is seen from a plane that will never land. As it turns out, the plane does land and the purpose of landing is to search for a lost boy. The good doctor was shanghaied because the parents of the boy wanted someone with experience running from large carnivores. By the end of the film, everyone has plenty of experience.

If I had one real complaint about this one it is the suspiciously good timing of the marines who turn up to save the day. That didn't destroy the story, though. By the time that happens, everything is pretty much over.

As with the second in the series, there are plenty of new dinosaurs at which to marvel. These include some that may pave the way for yet a fourth in the series.",1117843200,3,1239,4.259574468085106

1.)If this is the same island as ""The Lost World"", where did the landing strip come from?

2.)Um, was the Spinosaurus hibernating in ""The Lost World""?If he was, that may make sense, but why has he not interacted with the Trex before?

3.)After 8 weeks, A teenage boy can defeat raptors AND save Dr. Grant who has survived an island of dinosaurs already? How did the boy get his food? If no one was on that island for 4 years, then the food in that trailer would be old and unedible....even beans.

4.)Why didn't Dr. Grant wait for the check to be cleared before he agreed to go to the Island?

5.) I would havebeen satisfied in the end if the families of the three men sue THAT IRRITATING COUPLE for causing the men to lose their lives, even though they agreed to go. The couple was too annoying and stubborn!

The film is about a boy and his brother wave boarding, one day, on the outskirts of a deserted island. Unfortunately, the boat crashes, and the boy is forced to fend for himself. However, it seems that the island that the boy is stranded on is actually another Jurassic Park that was secretely under development a few years ago. It's now up to the paleontoligist from the original film to go to this island and save this young man before it's too late. The movie fails to offer anything original to the series except for a few new dinosaurs.

1296312,2,B00003CXXR,"I thought this film was just, whats the simple word? Horrible. I mean when I first walked into the movie theatre I was expecting to see a great film considering the first two were amazing though I was skeptical because #1. Steven Spielberg wasn't in the directors chair and #2. John Williams wasn't doing the music and last but certaintly not least, #3. The plot was corny and too simple. A 'married' couple(William H. Macy, Te'a Leoni) invite Dr. Alan Grant(Sam Neill) on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna for there wedding anniversary, at first he says 'No' but when they offer him money he can't refuse. So when they arrive to the island, he finds out the real reason why the couple brought him to the island, to look for there son Erik(Trevor Morgan) who had gone missing eight weeks before while parasailing with his moms boyfriend. It turns out that the 'married' couple actually got a divorce plus they can't give any money to Dr. Grant because they don't have any so basically it was all for nothing.

The reason why this film was in my opinion a total disgrace to the 'Jurassic Park' series is because:

#1. 'Jurassic Park ///' lacks the magic and originality that the first two 'JPs' had. It doesn't have that 'feel' of the first two at all but I guess you would expect that due to Spielberg not being in the directors chair. Now i'm not saying that Joe Johnson did a horrible job, he actually handled the directing better than I thought he would but i'm not saying he did a great job. He did an average job in my opinion.

#2. The film also lacks the sciency feel that the first two had, instead of focusing more on charector development and the science of the plot the third film focuses more on the action, I think that the director thought that if there was a ton of action then people would love it and not notice that it was missing everything else.

#3. The great things about the first two films is that you could never tell whether the dinosaurs were CGI or Animatronics because they were both used and blended in so well together. Well in this film thats not the case, you can easily tell when the dinosaurs are CGI or Ani or even a blend of the two, it kind of ruins the movie on its own.

#4. The look of the dinosaurs, I don't know what they were thinking when they made the Velociraptors. The raptors this time around loose there thrilling and scary appearences and instead look rediculous because of there purple,red and blue color scheme. Plus the film overplayed the 'Raptor Intelligence' a little too much that it soon gets rediculous and impossible to believe. Also, WHAT was wrong with the writers and crew when they decided to kill off the TRex five minutes in when it appeared and bring in the terribly portrayed Spinosaurus?! The way it killed the Rex would almost make you want to vomit seeing as how it would be impossible for the dinosaur to do. I don't know why Horner thinks that the Rex was a scavenger?!

#5. If you want a movie with a great climax then this film is not the one for you, I would instead recommend that you watch either 'Jurassic Park' or 'The Lost World:Jurassic Park' which in my opinion both have some of the most memorable climax's in movie history. Jurassic Park /// doesn't even have whats considered an ending, I can't even explain.

#6. The length of the film. Why is it that JP/// is only around 1 HR and 30 MIN when 'Jurassic Park' is 2 HR and 7 MIN and 'The Lost World' is even longer reaching at 2 HR and 9 MIN? If this film would have been longer than first of all, maybe there would have been a better climax, maybe it would explain more of InGens backstory like part /// was supposed to do and focus more on developing the charectors and inserting more science.

#7. Theres way too many plot holes left unanswered like the beginning for instance.

Now there are some good things in this film like...

Acting: The acting was very good except for Te'a Leoni, she overacted when it came to the 'being scared' scenes. When I first saw her she wasn't so bad but then when they got to the island her charector just went completly downhill, plus Te'a Leoni screamed too much than what she needed to, theres a scene that made me want to cover my ears. William H. Macy's acting was not near as good as his other films, I think his talent was put to waste in this film but his charector was likable at some times and his acting was averagly good. Sam Neill was the best in this film in my opinion though both him and his charector was wasted I thought his charector wasn't portrayed as good as it was in the first film but it was still good here though and once again Sam Neill's acting is superb. Alessandro Nivola was also good playing Alan's assistant at his dig site, his charector Billy Brennan tags along with Alan on the trip, I thought Alessandro did a pretty decent job and handeled the scenes pretty well. Trevor Morgan was also surpringly good considering he had acted in a Barney film in the past but once I saw one of his previous films 'The Patriot' I was less afraid do to his great performance in that film. Michael Jeter and the other actors did pretty good jobs in this film as well. One of the biggest highlights of the film was Laura Derns 3 minute cameo at the beggining and one minute cameo towards the end, she did a great job as Dr. Ellie Sattler in the first film and I was happy to see she was even slightly involved in this film even though the writers made it to where SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Alan and Ellie are now split up and shes married to some other man which made me mad about the film even more than I already was.

Overall if you expect this to further the JP series then don't look here but if you just want mindless action filled scenes then I guess watch it. Even though I hated part /// I am still very much looking forward to the upcoming 'Jurassic Park IV' because Spielberg is actually choosing the script and everyone working on it look and seem to be very dedicated on making it be as good as the first two especially from the recent news it seems to me that there actually taking there time on the fourth instead of doing a hafe-fast job like on JP///.",1114041600,2,6155,4.352787456445993

First of all, this movie's running length is not overly-long (it's only 90 minutes). Second, although it is an action film, it manages not to take itself too seriously (and even has refreshingly humorous moments throughout the movie). And finally, the filmakers have added some new dinosaurs to the mix, in this film, in addition to making them look even more realistic (technology has greatly improved since the first flick 12 years ago, and it shows). The actual plot is not bad either, but people are ultimately more interested in the quality of the dinosaur action sequences, and they deliver quite a bite (no pun intended).",1104710400,4,912,4.670807453416149

1296394,5,B00003CXXR,I know this movie wasn't directed by Spielberg but it is still just as good as the two prior to it. This is because it has amazing special effects that surpass the first two by far and also because it has a very gripping story line. This film is also helped by the great music composed by Don Davis.,1103846400,,299,4.084745762711864

The new storyline involves the rescuing of a crashed aircraft from Jurassic Park's 'Site B'.  The characters are all strong and well-acted, there is barely a dull moment, and the dinosaurs are at their best.  Worth noting is the giant Spinosaurus (watch out for the 'Jaws' tribute), which battles the T-Rex.",1100217600,,429,4.8493150684931505
1296396,5,B00003CXXR,ok this one is the bomb sooooooooo totally better then the first to if this thing would let me do it but i cant i would rate it 50 stars because it has alot of action and a good story. my favorite part was when the t-rex and even the bigger dinosaur fought against each other. its a really good movie a may be shorter then the other two but its the best one of all the animals are smarter too. also this island is isla sorna where they land on site b. if i were you buy this one too! jarrassic park 3 is the best to far will have to see what the forth one is about.,1098748800,,565,3.7563025210084033
1296397,5,B00003CXXR,I belive that jurassic park 3 had the best story line of the three because the first on was all action with no theme and the second one was really bad and the third had a lot of action and a good story line and rate it 6 stars 10x better than the rest.,1095724800,3,252,3.685185185185185
1296398,2,B00003CXXR,"What I mean by the title is simple, after reading the books for the first time recently, which are extremely good, I've noticed a lot of left out material from the books that's not in the movies, and Jurassic Park 3 just tries to take those left over scenes and put them into a movie and hope for the best. However the screen-writer did a very poor job, but the director ""Joe Johnston"" did well with that lousy script, so don't blame him, blame the screen-writer.

If you want to get the full effect of Jurassic Park, read the books. This movie itself Isn't great, and the story is really poor, so poor that the director couldn't do anything about it.

The action is pretty good, you will get pretty much non-stop action once on the island, a few ""Awe-ing"" scenes, and fun to watch.

The plot is poor, A kid goes parasailing with a friend of his mother's, gets stranded on Isla Sorna and his divorced parents trick Dr. Grant and his partner Billy into going on a ""Tour"" of the island to save their son. The son has been there for two months by himself, yea...right, and is perfectly fine.

To sum up, the movie is a poor attempt to get the missing material from the two books onto a movie, and a very poor attempt. But is fun to watch, if you don't mind a lousy plot. **/*****",1095379200,,1276,4.282157676348548
1296399,3,B00003CXXR,"After the disaster at Jurassic Park and on Isla Sorna,nature hasn't finished yet. From Joe Johnston and produced by Steven Speilberg comes the third thrilling adventure of Hammond's genetically engineered dinosaurs. The thrills continue when a divorced couple who claim be still married and rich ask Alan Grant to be their guide on Isla Sorna, the island that he hasn't been on, but he knows the danger of that island, from his Jurassic Park experience. He decides he will be their guide, but diaster arrives quickly when the spinesaurous shows up, a dinosaur bigger than T-rex,(T-rex is back too). The truth is revealed to Dr. Grant and his partner that they're really here to find their son, who had fallen to the island after parsailing. While trying to find him they encounter raptors,pteranodons,brachisaurs and Spinesaurous. Dr. Grant discovers the raptors are smarter then they ever were before,smarter than primates,dolphins and whales. It's another fight for survival. This film has the thrills of the first two JP films,it may not be directed by speilberg,but it's still another thrilling roaring ride and because of Jurassic Park III, Jurassic Park is now the thrilling trilogy, this another triumph,a thrill ride,brilliant, we saw the raptors in the first two movies and in this one their still rolling. If You liked JP and Lost World continue the adventure in this brilliant stomping,chomping exciting third film to Jurassic Park. We May Not get off this Island Alive.",1093651200,,1481,5.149377593360996
1296410,4,B00003CXXR,"The film opens with a return to Isla Sorna. A man and a boy are soaring behind a boat; then something happens to their tow boat. An ominous beginning, like with the first ""Jaws"". Professor Grant says he will never return to Isla Sorna. But a wealthy businessman shows up with a blank check. And so we return again to a very scary story. Again, the best laid plan of man fails due to an unforeseen event. When will they ever learn?

The film quickly gets up to speed and action. The computer generated images are better than in the first ""Jurassic Park"". The chatter among the survivors is better too. Having a cadaver pop up for horror recalls ""Indiana Jones"". [Does this kill off people's appetite for snacks?] Why do these people travel to a dangerous place unarmed? Is this film meant as a warning against cloning and genetic modifications?

By half-time the film tells of the survivors journey to the coast to escape. This film assumes there would be no monsters in the sea. But guess what they find up in the air? Of course, they manage to find a boat to take them down river to the coast. A last attack by a monster is averted with a flare gun (again recalling ""Jaws""). Then they are saved when the Marines land!

Tea Leoni shines like a star in this film. The fewer number of actors suggest a lower budget, compared to the original film. The conventions are followed in showing what happens to a man who steals. [But would that nest be uncovered? Not for alligators.] It seems unrealistic for a cell phone to be working after it passed through the digestion system.",1093046400,,1572,4.489510489510489
1296411,1,B00003CXXR,"And a pathetic excuse for a movie, period. This was obviously thrown together by the uninspired and talentless and put out just to make money. The special effects are under par and down right cartoony looking, the story is unengaging, the writing is sometimes absurd (example, ""Alan Grant"" telling people that if raptors hadn't died out, they and not humans would have become the dominant species on earth!!) and always weak, the scenes of humans meeting dinosaurs are poorly executed and ineffective...in fact, every scene is poorly executed and ineffective. The characters are boring and unlikable and I couldn't have cared less about any of them aside from Grant, who I wished wasn't in this piece of crap. The fact that they used pieces from the wonderful original score made it worse. This movie is awful. It was directed by the same man who directed Jumanji, and it shows. This is a pile of Spinosaurus dung that's disrespectful to the first movie and to anybody who loved it.",1092873600,,982,4.851190476190476
1296412,3,B00003CXXR,"Has anyone heard the phrase, ""Two's a party, three's a crowd""? Apparently not the mega-movie studio executives, who feel they can invite as many to the celebration as they want even if the end result is the movie-going public developing enochlophobia. The Hollywood obsession of maintaining a steady flow of profits through franchise pictures can be a mixed blessing to the public. On the one hand, series like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have gotten better in quality and enjoyment with each new film. But on the other hand, there are the few, most notably the Batman and Superman franchises (at least prior to their modern day revitalizations), that steadily decline in value as the number of films stack up. With The Lost World: Jurassic Park being officially labeled one of the worst sequels in recent memory, the third installment in the film series that had so much promise has a lot to overcome to ensure that this franchise doesn't disappoint.

The story centers once again on the island of Isla Sorna, also known as site B, where humans have landed as part of a rescue mission only to be in need of rescuing themselves from monstrous prehistoric creatures of all shape and size. Dr. Alan Grant, one of the few survivors from the tragic events that took place at InGen's Jurassic Park theme park in 1993, swore there would be no force on heaven or earth that would get him to return to that island, but times have changed. The once flourishing archeology business is now floundering as experts have become more interested in studying the living ""theme-park attractions"" created by InGen then the dusty bones of the past when it comes to the field of dinosaurs. Desperate for grant money to test his raptor intelligence theory, Grant agrees to join a ""wealthy"" couple in an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. But when their plane crash lands on the island and the group barely escape their first dinosaur encounter, the truth comes out. The two ""adventurers"" are actually a disengaged couple whose son, while on a thrill-seeking trip with a friend, was lost somewhere on the island. Now the group must face previously unknown dangers, ones undisclosed by InGen, as they make a desperate attempt to escape the island with their lives. The story for Jurassic Park III, as audacious as it tries to be by including crucial plot developments that should have been including in the last sequel, is once again strenuously predictable and presents a film that is nothing different then what audiences have seen in the last two films. Did Universal not get the message that public reaction to The Lost World was horrendous? You would think that with a sequel that received as much bad word of mouth as that film did, you would make a legitimate effort to win back audiences with at least a solid script, but that isn't the case at all here.

Taking a page from The Lost World's playbook, only one cast member from the original Jurassic Park film returns to the franchise joining a relatively undistinguished cast when one considers the demographic audience the studio is aiming for with this film. Sam Neill, who once again returns to the world of Jurassic Park in the role of Dr. Alan Grant, appears as though he is seriously contemplating where his acting career went wrong that he had to return to doing films like this. This isn't to say that his performance isn't up to par, in fact there seems to be little difference from the first film of how he portrays the character, but that he deserves better gigs then this. William H. Macy, who deserves so much more for his career then a starring role in a B-movie like this, works well with the material that is given to him and no one knowing the quality of the screenplay can ask for anything beyond that. Yes, the character is predictable, in the same light as the rest of the movie, but Macy gives him a charming, if not slightly bumbling, persona that makes the audience care about him. Unfortunately, this can not be said for the rest of the cast of characters. Jurassic Park III plays out in much the same way as Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection do when it comes to killing off characters, the audience simply doesn't care. The group is barely on the island less then ten minutes and two characters, ones we don't get any background on what-so-ever outside the fact that they are mercenaries, are killed right off the bat. The original two films, even the Lost World which, by all definition, was a disaster, gave each character a distinct personality and let the audience get a specific grasp on them so that when the killing started, we would know whether to root or fear for their safety.

Overall, Jurassic Park III, despite showing slight, if not trifling, improvements from the last installment, indicates the once vibrant franchise may be on its last leg and should go the way of the prehistoric beasts it was based on - to extinction. For those have no prior experience involved with the Jurassic Park franchise (what rock have you been hiding under?), JP3 can be an entertaining, if not enjoyable, B-movie experience with none of the usual burden of being the least bit memorable. On the other hand, if you happen to be one of those individuals who expects better from a highly-anticipated sequel then the same formulaic. Applause must be given to the filmmakers for at least attempting to relinquish to the requests of the franchise fanatics wanting difference and originality with the sequels. Sadly these improvements come too little too late. These simple changes to the series (namely new dinosaurs and more personality to the creatures) should have been made in The Lost World and by having them done here feels like a desperate attempt to breathe life back into this tired franchise. All in all, Jurassic Park III doesn't handle itself like a original feature but rather it comes off as a regurgitation of all the great elements of the first film and the worst aspects (and there were many) from the second, all blended together in a syrupy mess that works alright but can be easily forgotten. With the success that met this film upon its opening weekend, there's no doubt that another sequel is once again in the works over at Universal Studios. Let's just hope that they get the message this time around and actually venture on something original with the franchise.",1092873600,2,6341,4.736651583710407
1296413,3,B00003CXXR,"This film has outstanding special effects, excellent cinematography, a wonderful cast, and a thin script. While it is better than the second film in the Jurassic Park series, it comes nowhere near equaling the original Jurassic Park movie.

This film sees two of the original stars return, Sam Neill, as paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, in a cameo reprising her original role. Add William Macy and Tea Leoni, as a divorced couple who kidnap Dr. Grant and take him to Isla Sorna, site of Jurassic Park II, on a search and rescue mission for their twelve year old son, who disappeared eight weeks earlier while parasailing over Isla Sorna with his mother's boyfriend.

After the initial breathtaking, opening scene of the boy and his mother's friend parasailing, the movie starts going south almost immediately, which is not to say that it is not enjoyable. It is, but not as enjoyable as it could have been, had it been filmed with an intelligent script.

The movie is only an hour and a half long. In the process of making it a succinct film, the actors race through the plot, leaving certain questions unanswered or certain issues unexplained, in the almost indecent haste to get the film over with.

The actions of some of the characters are often unbelievable. Clearly terrorized, the characters do not hesitate to run off by themselves. They also do not hesitate to make as much noise as possible. Obviously, they do this in order to put themselves into a situation where they will be injured, chased, or eaten by a dinosaur.

As I said, little thought appears to have been given to formulating an intelligent script. Still, if the viewer is willing to suspend all rational thought, one should get some enjoyment from viewing this moderately entertaining film",1092441600,25,1777,4.851485148514851
1296414,4,B00003CXXR,This movie is just pure fun. Thats all it is! The series is going to be if not already classic. See these films! Theyre a blast!,1089244800,,128,3.9615384615384617
1296415,3,B00003CXXR,"Being a lifelong Dinosaur fan, I had to check out JP///. The trailers were making the movie seem really big and fresh with bringing Spinosaurus in to replace Tyrannosaurus as the starring role as super-predator in the JP series. The film moves at a pretty fast rate which can be good and bad. The Dinosaurs in the film are more believable now that the CGI programmers had the ability to make the Dinos' skin wobble when they moved and to have other parts of their body be in sync with the rest of their body.
The characters really don't have much development in the film which is okay considering you came to see Dinosaurs. But there is just enough character development for the moviegoer to understand each character.
My only gripes are with the film that it just seemed like the Dino action seemed to go downhill as the movie progressed. It starts off very well with the Spinosaurus attacking the plane and then eventually battling Tyrannosaurus (which I was hoping wouldn't show up until the final minutes of the film, giving it a climatic ending). After that, the Dinos seemed kinda sparse and the action shorter and shorter. The raptors also kinda got old. Like with T-rex, the filmmakers should have replaced the raptors with other Dinos. Maybe Baryonyxs? Also some science is forgotten in this film. But they had Jack Horner as their Dino supervisor, so it was a given some wrenches would be thrown in the mix. Also, the film seemed really short. With some newer dinos added to the screen that have never been seen before, I was hoping that they would have some pretty nifty Dinosaur battle sequences and Dinosaur-human encounters.
All in all, while JP/// was, somewhat, of a letdown for me, it still provided the goods for the most part.",1088553600,,1745,4.687296416938111
1296416,4,B00003CXXR,"Yes, this movie does have some plot holes, and it is not as good as the first movie in the series, but this movie is definitely better than ""The Lost World.""  Somewhat formulaic at this point, but still a decent movie with a simpler and more plausible plot line than the previous movie.
A couple's son is parasailing off the back of a boat off Isla Sorna when something unseen happens to the people driving the boat.  The boy's parents, Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and Amanda Kirby (T?a Leoni), enlist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to help get the boy back.  However, they have to trick Dr. Malcolm into returning to the island, because he, rightfully, thinks being on that island is a very bad idea.
As it turns out, landing a plane on the island was a very bad idea, and now the erstwhile rescuers are running for their lives.  Along the way they find Erik Kirby (Trevor Morgan), and the only remaining task is to escape from the island.
Several new dinosaurs are introduced in this movie, including really cool pteranodons and a spinosaurus.  The pteranodons act like giant birds, and are appropriately scary.  The spinosaurus shows that the tyrannosaurus was not the king of the world.  The encounters with the dinosaurs recall the thrills of the first movie in this series and are interesting and enjoyable.
There are a few plot holes in this movie, but fewer than in the previous movie.  By keeping the plot simple and having fewer characters with a simpler motivation the movie avoids the incongruities of the previous movie.  This movie was more creative and intriguing and favored adrenaline over depth, as in the first movie.  The shorter length of the movie also minimizes opportunities to overly analyze the plot, keeping the focus on the action.  A sequel not quite as good as the original, but superior to its predecessor.",1088208000,5,1839,4.733542319749216

1296449,5,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park 3 one of the big summer blockbusters out of 2001 next to ""Tomb Raider"".
This has been the third in the Trilogy of Jurassic Park, no other sequels have been made since the first hit from Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg so it seems that they ride might over for JP fans. This film again uses the same elements of cgi animation and several of the same models of Dinosaurs from the other installments. However new
new dinosaurs are introduced and the writers changed the characters around in this one
to add a bit of tension and suspense that works throughtout the whole movie.
Dr. Grant (Sam Niel), who in the first movie acts as a moral, and
ethical scientist in the first movie, is a hypocrital,
contradicting scientist in this one.
At first, Dr. Grant, rejects any offers to study Dinosaurs saying that his previous experience in
Jurassic Park has annoyed from doing any other research.
However, when Mr. Brimley (William H. Macy) offers to
pay millions of dollars just to have Mr. Grant's presence and insight into the Dinosaurs of Lor Sorna,
Grant has no problem signing over himself to the project.
He definitely is more interested in the financial and egotistical benefits of the project, than the actual
scientist benefits of the project.
The cool thing about the Jurassic Park movies, is that
you don't have to watch every movie, to find out what's going on.
Since the stories are basically the same in every movie,
you can watch and be entertained by each movie, without
being concerned about the plot.
The plot in this case, is that once again more genetic
research in Dinosaurs has led to a creation of dinosaurs
on Lor Sorna in Costa Rica.
Then a group of scientists, interested in the Dinosaurs
wants to come down to Lor Sorna to ""study"" the dinosaurs.
The movie starts with a lecture being conducted by Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) who was in the first Jurassic Park.
Dr. Grant finds out that new research in genetic testing
has led to new dinosaurs being bred in Lor Sorna in
Costa Rica.
Grant eventually receives offers to study the dinosaurs
but rejects all of them, saying that he has enough of
dinosaurs (he almost died in the first movie).
However, a rich, entreprenual married couple is about to change that.
They eventually offer Dr. Grant millions of dollars to have his presence in a special trip that the couple plan to make to this new Jurassic Park.
However, all their plans are about to go amok, as the
group of scientists, run into a bunch of dinosaurs, more
deadly, more intelligent, and more scarier that
the first dinosaurs in Jurassic Park........
Jurassic Park 3 has probably the best special effects
I've seen in a dinosaur movie. Partially inspired
by movies like ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"" the special
effects team of Industrial Light and Magic and Stan
Winston, once again, bring this monstrous creatures
to life in all their glory.
JP3 also offers a ton of suspense and thrills.
There a bunch of new Dinosaurs in the movie.
The Spinosaurs, who can attack in both land and sea
is terrifying.
Also Director Joe Johnston, managed to add new life into the series by making the Dinosaurs smarter than ever.
The dinosaurs now ""call"" to one another, when they
see a prey they want to kill. The dinosaurs can now also use their brain to corner and attack, their prey in many new ways.
The scene in the lab, in which a dinosaurs corners their next victim is a great example of that.
However, despite this JP3 is a fantastic achievement by
ILM and Universal.
I was amazed by the features on the DVD version of Jurassic Park III:
*You get a special tour of ILM with Stan Winston
*Trailer of the movie
* Special interview with Paleontologist Jack Horner
and much more like many featurettes on the making of hte film

This film ultimately could've been better had Steven been back in the director seat.  The effects were iffy.  Whoever had the idea of replacing the T-Rex in the film should be kicked out of Hollywood.  The Rex should have stayed.  Another thing, are the Velociraptors getting Extreme Makeovers during each of the film releases, I mean, who's idea was the featheres. The acting was so so, on the exception of Neil, Leoni, and that little kid. Macy let me down on his performance. This film was a little bit of a thrill ride, but the film lacked the realism, the sense of danger, and the tenstion that the other two films had.  I dred Jurassic Park IV even though Spieldberg is directing again.  Hopefully he can dig himself out of the rut that Johnston put him in.",1082505600,2,862,4.594771241830065

1296452,2,B00003CXXR,"""Computer geeks playing with their toys"" would be a good way to describe the plot of this film. In this age of rampant technology we're seeing more and more movies being made based upon the technology available. Plot is an afterthought - the focus is in finding ways to exploit new computer graphics.
The fact is, there was no reason for this film to be made. There is nothing in it that cannot be found in one of the first two films. I mean this literally, for in some cases actual ""plot"" lines were borrowed. The worst part about this film may be that its one redeeming quality - the effects - were actually poorer than the original which came out in '93.
The ridiculous unrealism that crept into ""The Lost World"" runs rampant in JP3, providing us with memorable scenes such as a cell phone's ring being heard through a giant dinosaur's body (he swallowed it), raptor's speaking to each other, Grant learning their language and communicating with them (why yes, I speak Raptonian...), and a kid who in a few weeks alone on the island has become a dinosaur and survival expert.
There is no reason whatsoever I can give to you to go see this film, especially if you've seen the first two. But, if JP4 comes out, maybe they'll give the raptors subtitles. I'd pay to see that.",1077148800,3,1274,4.495689655172414

Tea Leoni as Woman in Peril, Sam Niell as reluctant hero, Alessandro Nivola as cocky protege, William H Macy is written forgettably, and Trevor Morgan falls into place as resourceful, Spunky Kid in need of rescue. The dinosaurs are either properly villainous, or an appropriate source of harmless comic relief.
Suffice it to say: a tired rehashing of gimmicky plot twists (We're stuck on the island! Raptors are back! Raptors are smarter than we thought! So-and-so is stuck in a cage, with a raptor bearing down! There's no way they could escape this tyrannosaurus! Wait, here comes another dinosaur to distract it! They'll fight and we'll escape! )
I'll save you the suspense: they didn't skimp, they gave you a ""digging through a 4-foot, steaming pile of fecal matter"" scene, audible slurping and squishing sounds and all. Whoever decides to do a fourth installment should save some time and money and just write it as a romantic comedy with Sam Niell and Laura Dern's characters engaged in some wacky paleontological adventures, complete with comedic sexual tension and requisite end-of-movie wrap-up kiss.

Although the plot was rather vague and ambiguous, the special effects, sound, cinematography were quite weak, as expected. I don't think anyone expected the same thrill they received when they saw the original Jurassic Park.
During most of the scenes, it felt as though the screen writers decided to make a movie about dinosaurs chasing people, trying to kill them. If there was an excuse to bring the dinosaurs close to people, such an action was always followed. This was strange.
Also, considering the quickness of the movie -- roughly 90 minutes -- it felt as though the movie was rushed. Thus, it fueled the belief, even more, that this movie had no plot and a hurried atmosphere. It was okay. This was certainly not a great film.",1070150400,,862,4.831081081081081

But this is different from the two first chapters. Let me explain. This is the (very simple and stupid) story of a young boy doing some kind of parachute with a friend of his parents over Isla Sorna (the island where the story of The Lost World happened). But with some amazing coincidences and unpredictable events (do you feel the sarcasm?), they crash on the island. Then, 8 weeks later (that's a long time to survive, on a near island) the parents pay Alan Grant to come with them save their son on the island. Don't you think the story is stupid? Don't you think this is gratuitous reason to go on an island and get eaten by dinosaurs...This is stupid to the extreme...seriously. But, not only they have a crap-head scenario, but they also have special effects that are really not as good as the first two's. I couldn't recognize the raptors, because teh dinosaur models are different and cheaper, and also, the dinosaurs are so fake sometimes, it's evident...the illusion isn't really there. There are new species of dinosaurs, but the only T-Rex you see lasts only one minute. But the most stupid point of the film, making it a possible winner at the Razzies fest, is the NEW intelligence of the dinosaurs...they communicate like humans (they don't speak, but it almost sounds like that sometimes), they look at each other, they trap humans...this is awfully stupid...and especially in the dinosaur fight, one of them kills the other by holding his head and breaking his neck...and why don't they eat the humans they kill? The acting isn't so good, William H Macy is real bad and fake, like Tea Leoni...some awful one-liners, too predictable to be true...really. The action is so brief, you can't enter into it, there is no stress, no suspense...and the movie has a running time of 85 minutes...plain bad. Overall, stupid story, bad acting, sucky scenario, lame action, no plot, no suspense, just a sell-out under the Jurassic Park title. 2/10",1065484800,,2094,4.851955307262569
1296488,3,B00003CXXR,"one of my favorite things about JP3 is it's DVD cover. I LOVE IT!!!
other than that, the movie has some good moments, good shots, and then there's JP3.
for one, i'm a huge fan of the T-Rex and to see it get KO'd in less than 1 minute was flat out a disgrace.
two, the acting is very off in this movie. in the original Jurassic Park, the acting was AWSOME and REAL. it felt real, and made you believe like you were actually there with them in the park, and like you were being chased by the T-Rex, yet here, it's like, ""oh, here comes a dinosaur, run!""
acting was to dry, and then to top it off, to corny.
how do we begin this movie? by two parents on the brink of a divorce who let their kids who aren't even 18 yet, go on a vacation that includes parachuting near the island of Jurassic Park?
finally, this movie was to short! it runs at about 1 hour 23 minutes!?!? yet in the theater, it felt like 3 hours long. why? cause it wasn't that good.
JP 3 was to fast and quick and should have been slowed down like the original film and re-casting wound not have hurt either.
still, it's a Jurassic Park movie, so i had to get it. hey, i got it for $5.",1065052800,,1148,3.9740259740259742
1296489,3,B00003CXXR,"After four years, another JURASSIC PARK sequel was in the making.  JURASSIC PARK III returns Sam Neill to the role of Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is tricked into serving as a tour guide above Site B (from THE LOST WORLD) by a husband and wife millionaire team  - only to discover that the ""millionares"" aren't what they seem, and that the island has some hungry new inhabitants.  While better than THE LOST WORLD, JURASSIC PARK III is still a weak film at best; Neill is good, and Joe Johnston's directing is fine; the new music by Don Davis is fitting, but can't come near John Williams' scores; the highlight of the film, of course, again, is the dinosaurs.  This time around, they're even more real than in JURASSIC PARK or THE LOST WORLD!  In fact, they may even be the most realistic special effects I've ever seen.  Other than that, really all you can expect is bickering/annoying parents William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, and a sequel that will provide you with nothing more than average thrills.",1063238400,,1005,4.617977528089888
1296490,2,B00003CXXR,"Please note that the only reason I gave this movie above one star is a terrific plane crash sequence that rivals the first two films as far as suspense goes. But aside from that...what a mess.
Well, it's very fitting that this movie was released the same year a movie like Gladiator was. Gladiator was the best picture, and this was a top money maker in 2001 - the year of mediocrity. Movies are becoming more and more of the same as every year passes. I write this review in 2003, when seemingly every movie out in theaters either has a number by its title (sequels) or you can go to a video store and rent an earlier version (remakes). JP III isn't the movie that started this trend, but it certainly stepped in line. It's not a movie that can claim to be the first to do this, but it certainly can be an example of when a movie is both a sequel and a remake. Everything you see in JP III has been seen in the first two films. Lost children, adults that trick the experts into going in the first place, the experts being right about nearly everything, except when they always predict their own death...that never happens.
The story is nearly identical to The Lost World...in fact, it happens on the same island The Lost World happened! This time, Ian Malcom is replaced by Alan Grant (Sam Neill), but he to is seemingly unable to shake the demons of his experiences of the first time he visited the Park. He says early on that he would never set foot on the islands inhabited by dinosaurs ever agian, until William H. Macy and Tea Leone come along with a checkbook, promising him to fund his dig for several years (didn't John hammond do the same thing eight years ago? Did he ever see that money?). They tell him that they want to explore the island, but really their son is lost on it.
I think the real flaw in this movie is that, while embracing some aspects of the first two, it ignores other, more important ones. For instance, despite the fact that it's the same island as The Lost World, the landscape has totally changed. And the big thing - that new Spinosaurus. No mention of how it got there, or why no one wouldn't have seen it in the previous installment. I understand that this was supposed to be a popcorn flick, no heavy thinking, but it even fails there. The characters are flat, and you don't feel sorry at all for Macy and Leoni (I can't even remember their character names). They can stand for minutes without a dinosaur showing up, then they show up and get outrun and outsmarted by bumbling idiots who don't listen to what Grant has to say. This was a movie designed to get money, which it did. Unfortunately, Speilberg (who produced this one after directing the other two) is considering doing JP IV. Is it me or does that make anyone else shudder?",1061596800,3,2773,4.386407766990291
1296491,1,B00003CXXR,"Besides the fact that this movie is incredibly short there are horrible plot holes.  Why on Earth is there a new Dinosuar wouldn't we have heard about it in the previous movies?  He kills T-rex right when we see them but if he was so superior He would have killed him a long time ago.  All of the people get killed in the first few minutes.  After that no one dies how is that suspenseful?  The Veloceraptors talk too.  This movie is very poorly written.  It is as if the producers walked in and said ""new dinosaur, veloceraptors talk, nobdy important dies; run with it""",1061337600,,570,4.371428571428571
1296492,4,B00003CXXR,"I know that when I go to see a summer blockbuster movie, I cannot expect deep explorations of philosophical themes... it is just fun, and it eventually just comes down to how much do you like certain stereotypes and hate others. There is no difference whatsoever between this movie and others like The Rock, Armageddon, Batman, Spiderman, ID4 etc,etc,etc. They are all just made to entertain as many people as possible. So I don't really care if they made up a dinosaur for this movie (Spinosaur was actually a dinosaur... the one they made up a little bit for the movie was the Pteranodon, which was not like they showed it in the movie)... I just care enough to get into the movie. I liked its quick pace, I loved the character of Alan Grant, and I enjoyed seeing Tea Leoni hanging from a tree while two raptors try to reach her, as much as I enjoyed William H. Macy's clumsyness. I was so thankful that Ian Malcolm and his annoying daughter were not back almost as much as I was about the T-Rex staying in the island and eventually dying. The one big gap is not if the telephone could be heard from the belly of the dinosaur or if the military answer was too quick... the gap in this movie is simply that it is too short... It lacks one more act, a more entertaining conclusion and a couple of other deaths. What I enjoyed particularly was the crash scene until the T-Rex/Spinosaur fight, the image of the raptors running through the planes (they could have played more with these kind of images and frames) and, above all, the birdcage scene. It was fantastic, very well cut and that's the action I like to see... people running through strange enviroments and moving all around it (they start way up, a bridge, an aereal capture, parasailing, falling to the river, runnning between cliffs, etc). Well, these are the stereotypes I like to see in a blockbuster summer movie (not the world being collapsed by a rock that comes from outer space, nor Will Smith saying I make this look good or Bill Pullman: today we celebrate our independence day, puaghhh!): people being chased by huge digital or mechanical teeth, while falling, burning, exploding, etc. The stars up in the beginning od this review are not the same kind of other of my reviews. I liked this movie, I enjoyed it a lot... but in the end of the day, this is not a movie I'll be thinking much about in other terms than its own plot twists and roars.
Just enjoy it... if you like this kind of entertainment.",1059523200,,2472,4.495555555555556
1296493,1,B00003CXXR,"If you can remember the Godzilla remake by Roland Emmerich & Dean Devlin, then you must have had nightmares on how bad it was. The bad rip offs of much better movies and the extremely corny, sentimental dialogs only written to please slow adults and small children. This movie was so bad in fact that you don't need Mike and the Bots from MST3K to make fun of it, the movie writes its own punch lines for you to say. Any movie with Matthew Broderick as an action hero should be an indication on how bad it is, and with a monster that looks more like a raptor than the Godzilla who all know and love, the recipe for failure is pretty big.
Which brings us to this film which is not only one of the worse sequels ever made but probably one of the worse films made period. Sam Neil is a great actor, but the film itself is so bad that it makes him look like a buffoon. The way they tried to make him into an Indiana Jones wannabe is not only sad but also flat out laughable. He comes more a cross more like Chevy Chase than Harrison Ford.  The casts of supporting characters fares no better and in some respect fare much worse. William H Macy is probably one of the best actors around but you really cant tell that by his performance here which is beyond annoying.  Tea Leoni is flat out annoying as well as his wife, a woman whose scream could chip years old paint. I think the only actor who fares decent here is the late Michael Jeter, who is barely in the film at all. His performance is funny, and could have benefited the film a lot more if he was in it more.
The special effects are not as impressive as they were in the last two films, and the direction is very disjointed compared to what Spielberg was able to do with the first two movies.  Spielberg was able to create tension and create action scenes that can blow your socks off. Joe Johnson, who steps in for Mr. Spielberg this time around not only abandons what his predecessor had done before but completely disregards any logic that the other movies had. The first two films where about science and the dangers of tampering with nature. This film is just a strait forward monster movie that does not even have a plot to go by. The characters here are nothing more than Dinosaur food and the setting itself does not even look like the island of the last movie. There are even certain things in this film that even contradicts some of the information that was giving in the last two films, and it tries to bring in a dinosaur that was not even created in those movies.
Its really sad to see Joe Johnson demean himself with a bad film like this, because he has done much better work in the past.  The Rocketter is a prime example of a good comic book movie, and October Sky is a well-paced family drama that should have had more notice in the theater. With this movie, Joe looks like he just wanted to cash a pay check, and judging by the way every thing in the film was done, it looks like every one involved were doing the same thing. Which is sad in a sense because its the fans that pay for it in the long run.",1058832000,,3074,4.213921901528013
1296494,4,B00003CXXR,"JURASSIC PARK - 1, was larger than life; larger than anything else that had came out of Hollywood, larger than anything that Spielberg had done before. The concept was fresh, the dinosaurs were scary, the backdrop was unimaginably awesome, and the direction, impeccable. Justifiably, it turned out to be one of the best movies ever, with a huge cult following. It was only natural that it had to be followed up by a sequel, which turned out to be a great disappointment, alas! With the high expectations raised by the first part, in an attempt to live upto the high expectations, in THE LOST WORLD, Spielberg, it seems, tried a bit too hard, making a mess of the movie altogether, making it much too long, much too boring.
However, JURASSIC PARK - 3, is surprisingly much better than THE LOST WORLD, especially, since, it isn't directed by Spielberg.  OK, so it has the same dinosaurs, and has them chasing around and killing the humans, who repeatedly happen to drop themselves by amongst the dinosaurs, for some strange reason or the other. Well, if THE LOST WORLD was solely about dinosaurs chasing around humans, with a very sorry ending giving out the message ""don't mess with nature"", this one however, has dinosaurs chasing around humans, but with the feel of a fast-paced action movie! In JURASSIC PARK - 3, the director doesn't try to complicate things by trying to bring the dinosaurs to the city and try to make a GODZILLA and a JURASSIC PARK at the same time, but concentrates wholly on the action taking place within the island itself. The movie is incredibly short, and is action-packed, with dinosaurs popping out from every corner of the screen, without a moment of respite; and before you know, the movie ends.
Unlike THE LOST WORLD, the straightforwardness of JURASSIC PARK - 3 is what makes it a highly viewable movie. There are however, certain things, which this movie could have carried on from THE LOST WORLD, like JEFF GOLDBLUM, and his sarcasms, reeking with pessimism.  The movie is packed with action from the first scene to the last, without trying too hard to be intelligent. Since it doesn't try to achieve much, but only try to entertain, it is short, and makes the viewer want for more.",1058745600,,2218,4.743523316062176

1296554,3,B00003CXXR,"I was so excited to see ""Jurassic Park 3"" when it was released in the theaters, but I was disappointed in this installment. The first two films had me on the edge of my seat. Granted, this one did too at moments, but I think the whole storyline just turned me off. The fact that a couple hired Sam Neill's character to find their son who had crashed on the now deserted island where the former Jurassic Park existed had me shaking my head in disbelief. I thought more could have been done to develop this storyline, but I think the special effects and the dinosaurs made up for that.
This was also the first in the ""Jurassic Park"" series that was not directed by Steven Spielberg and it definitely showed. Don't get me wrong, the director of this film did a good job, but that spark that Spielberg brings to his films was missing.
""Jurassic Park 3"" was a pretty good movie and I would suggest it to those who are fans of the series, but at the same time, don't get your hopes up too high because they may (or may not) come crashing down.",1054166400,,1037,4.269035532994923

1296556,2,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park 3"" is probably the most disappointed with a film I've ever been. It had so much going for it, and delivered so little. The film's biggest problem is the silly plot. The first film was believable, the second film was fun, this one's got energy, but we've been there, done that. But back to the plot: Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is lured back to the island the same way he was lured the first time: with money. That Grant could possibly be so greedy and stupid is the film's most unbelievable part. Most everyone (the characters) in this movie deserves to be eaten by dinosaurs, but only a few are. In a way, I'm glad Spielberg didn't direct this one. This would have seriously hurt his career. It's not a terrible film, but it's not good. I'd say only hardcore fans might like this one.

1296557,4,B00003CXXR,"Ready for some forget-about-the-real-world-for-awhile fun?  This film may have been the third release in the J-Park trilogy, but it is clearly the 2nd best of the series.  No sequel will ever outdo the novelty of the original, but this episode injects enough ""oomph"" into the storyline to keep you on the edge of your seat.  For starters:
1. Sam Neill returns in the lead role...
2. Introduction of a predator bigger and badder than T-Rex (who knew?!)...
3. Intro of a flying dinosaur species (In the minds of even casual dinosaur enthusiasts, the dino-bird is a ""must have"" element which was grossly absent from the earlier movies)...
4. Continued character development of Velociraptors is extremely well done.  The complexity of the raptor's personality is human-like by the end of the show...
5. The movie didn't try to outdo itself as was done in the Lost World by bringing dinosaurs to the mainland.  (Jurassic Park will never be Godzilla.)  Generally speaking, the plot lived within its means.
So why only 4 stars?  Of all things, HUMAN character development and motivation is a little hard to keep up with.  You just kind of get the sense that the writers couldn't come up with a really good idea to get everyone on the island in the first place, so they had to pick something kind of outlandish.  As a result, they had to spend the rest of the movie scrambling to explain and resolve that outlandishness into something believable.  Close, but no cigar.
That said, it's a good fantasy/action movie, defintely one that is worth popping corn for.  You'll be better off seeing the first two J-Park videos first, so that you can understand the historical references in this film.  Enjoy!",1050192000,,1690,4.829861111111111

The cast in general is so annoying that you want the dinosaurs to kill them, and the script itself is nothing more than a thin out line for show and tell. The special effects are a few steps behind the last film, and the Spinosauris is able to change shape during different parts of the film.
 This movie is so bad, that I don't even consider it a Jurassic Park film, and anyone who even dares say that it's even better than the first or the second (which despite it's flaws manages to entertain in a way this movie only dreams of doing) should be a shame of themselves.",1049241600,,837,4.198757763975156

But guess what?  It's 100 times better than Lost World.  So is it really a 5 star movie?  Maybe not, but I'm gonna give it that JUST because it is SOOOOOOO much better than that lousy sequel Lost World.
This one makes up in spades for the problems with Lost World and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The story is not all over the map here, it's not that long so it's not obviously padded out in long boring go nowhere scenes like in Lost World.  And the story and characters are all much more believable here.  This cannot compare to the original film, but THIS should've been the sequel, not that awful Lost World.  This one has cool dinosaurs all over the place not a bunch of boring talking scenes over and over like Lost World.  The music and direction is just as good as the first one also.  And Tea Leone is a dish to look at.
This is a perfect rainy Saturday afternoon popcorn muncher and because it is short, it's much better packed with essentials and the story and pace is so much better than ... Lost World.  ... I would never buy any trilogy set for this because that means it would include the second film Lost World, ... Jurassic Park III has been on cable constantly for months and it's always fun to put on and watch bits and pieces.
Okay, so it's not nearly as good as the original, and it is by no means any sort of landmark or great film, but comparitively speaking, and that's where this review is coming from, COMPARED TO THE LOST WORLD, this movie absolutely RULES!

This film unfortunately not only a major let down in every sense of the word but a major letdown to the fans in general. There is really no plot to speak off what so ever in this lousy follow up but another excuse to bring people back in contact with the dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs themselves look more like C.G.I cartoons than real animals, and when you have acting as bad as the special effects themselves, you know that the movie is in trouble.

1296593,3,B00003CXXR,"Eight weeks after he accidentally crashed on Isla Sorna, the Kirbys still have hope that their son has managed to survive. That's why they basically trick Dr. Alan Grant into an almost hopeless rescue mission. If you can get past this hard-to-believe premise, then you can enjoy ""Jurassic Park 3"" for what it is: a very expensive B-movie.
Despite being the only installment of the trilogy that's not directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Jurassic Park 3"" carries on the franchise proudly, and most important, effectively. For starters, it's an enormous pleasure to see Sam Neill (who had refused to return for the first sequel) back in the lead role. I have nothing against Jeff Goldblum, but with the possible exception of ""The Fly"", he just can't sustain a whole movie by himself. Sam Neill's character, on the other hand, is the right choice to go against a deadly pack of super-intelligent Velociraptors, the always lethal T-Rex and a new foe: one nasty Spinosaurus. Also, the flying Pteranodon, absent from the first two movies, finally has a chance to measure itself against the humans. With all these new dinosaurs, the over-the-top special effects, and enough action to go around and not get tiresome for 90 minutes, ""Jurassic Park 3"" almost surpasses (in my opinion) ""The Lost World"".
In the extras department, the movie really focuses on the special effects, mainly concerning the creation of the dinosaurs. Nothing new if you have seen the other two movies, but the dinosaur information and the excellent commentary by the SFX crew (including guru Stan Winston) will make it worth your while. The video and sound quality are top of the line, but that's almost a usual treat coming from Universal Studios releases.
Now, don't go looking for something too smart here. ""Jurassic Park 3"" is all about the fun, and the less cerebral you are, the better. I mean, sure, the plot is holey and some sequences are a bit corny (it's hard not to laugh when young Eric appears in his jungle camouflage outfit, or when Dr. Grant uses the world's weirdest harmonica to ""charm"" the raptors), but with an effective mix of action, humor and eye candy, ""Jurassic Park 3"" is just enough to prove that sequels aren't necessarily bad, as long as you keep it exciting.",1048291200,,2249,4.859375

Sadly the Jurassic Park 3 lacked all of the above. The storyline was cheesy at best. Dr. Grant accompanying a couple on a flyby over Isla Sorna which later turns out to be a rescue mission for their lost son. Improved graphics, new dinosaurs and more action. But that's basically it.
But the movie is still fun to watch. It's fast paced with lot of great action scenes. Suspense wasn't lacking and the special effects as usual were top notch.

JURASSIC PARK III does not run into that problem and it even surpasses the second film on all accounts.  The big factor is that a new dinosaur has dethroned T-Rex as the new king predator(Spinosaurus), and that the Raptors are given even more intelligence(compared to that of Dolphins to the point of having communicative skills) than what was shown in the original movie.  The only complaint is that T-Rex loses to Spinosaurus early on in the film.  One would think that the filmakers would set up a confrontation between the two early on, then have a showdown near the end. Also, we find out that Ellie and Dr. Grant from the first JURASSIC PARK (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) are no longer married, but still have a loving, respected, and professional relationship. With that aside, the film pace moves briskly as characters are killed off by the dinosaurs early on such as Cooper (John Diehl-Miami Vice, DC Cab) and Udesky (Micheal Jeter - The Green Mile). The very reliable and likable Sam Neill reprises his role as Dr. Grant again (a role he is so perfect for), and is joined by another reliable and likable actor, William H. Macy (Fargo, Mystery Men), and Tea Leoni.  Also, in the mix, a pre-teen character played by Trevor Morgan who plays the son of Macy and Leoni.  The character is very refreshing because the filmakers make him smart, self reliant, and caring, instead of a rehash of smart alecky, mean-spirited, young teens we see in so many films these days.  Overall, a great piece of entertainment with CGI that is so breathtaking and seamless, that one would think that dinosaurs still exist today.",1040860800,,1729,4.686468646864687
1296598,1,B00003CXXR,"I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I am of the third installment in the Jurassic Park series. Everything about JP3 is so disappointing. This may sound like this is coming from someone who had high hopes for JP3 but actually NO, I had low expectations for it but to my shock & dismay, this movie missed meeting those by a mile. Bloody Hell, I had better expectations with Rocky & Bullwinkle back in 2000 and at least a few of them were met even though that was [...] can fodder.
The entire plot is so ridiculous. The thing begins with someone who gets lost on an island after a skydiving accident, one dies, and it all just simply goes downhill after that. Sam Niell who did such a great job on the playing Dr. Alan Grant in the 1993 original Jurassic Park movie, does such a clumsy job on playing the character, almost as if he were forced into the acting studio against his will. I couldn't have thought of a much worse acting crew either. I can't blame him for the hollow character acting. The others fell completely through the trampoline with absolutely absurd character playing, and absolutely pointless plots, no sense of chemistry, and little, if any sense of writing was put into the plot. Where there was chemistry in the characters in the first movie, there is none of that in the same ppl in this third installment, and instead are those that seem to have the brains of a raisin.
There are some occasional good moments with the plane crash scene being well filmed and a sense of intensity of them trying to get out in time but overall, even that doesn't put any merits into the film. Neither does the awesome, stunning views of the misty valleys, rainforests, and the mountains, even though they're great too look at. In fact, the landscape felt like the most interesting thing in the movie besides T. Rex.
Overall in fact, Jurassic Park III feels more like a scrapped version of the first in the JP trilogy as at least in the Lost World, there was some ground being broken as T. Rex got onto the mainland, but here, it's all confined to the small island of Isle Sorna with the same old, same old, script that felt more like it was taken out of the recycle bin and made into a movie without depth put into it. There is nothing groundbreaking nor anything that got me into a state of excitement or thrills. The ending was just plain laughable with a sense of the lack a climax and unfinished filming. When I left the theatre in bitter disappointment, I felt like I had flushed [$$$], and 90 minutes of my life down the toilet!
 I have no idea of what they were thinking when they made this film but what I can say is if it was the same person who write the original one in 1993, Jurassic Park III is his first complete misfire. This addition to the trilogy was a total disappointment. I'm not pleased!",1039305600,3,2823,4.418426103646833
1296599,1,B00003CXXR,"Oh my god! This can't be happening! This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Let's look at why:
1. The story- unbelievably pathetic. Sure, I understand why 2 worried parents go on the island to find their lost annoying son, but the way they all get out of the mess is so STUPID it made me wanna scream! I mean, a CELL PHONE!!?? How can a cell phone possibly get any reception on a deserted island full of dinosaurs?? Oh save the phone, it's our only hope! gag!!!
2. The characters- Sam Niell looked through the entire movie as if he wanted nothing to do with it, and I can't blame him! After an amazing performance by all of his costars and him in the original, he's now teamed up with a group of the dumbest, whiniest people on the planet. They were all just SO STUPID! Not to mention the horrible acting! I mean, it did have a couple of decent big names, like Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, but even they didn't seem to look as if they were trying
3. The Dinosaurs- the whole thing was amazing in the first, and still cool in the second, but by this time everything just got really old, and the writers trying to come up with something new like ""thinking dinasaurs"" was like something they pulled out of their [rear-ends] after a 5 minute meeting.
4. The Ending- Oh my god! The end of this movie is like an angry Jack in the Box, it comes out of nowhere and slaps you right in the face saying ""get out of here! We're done trying to entertain you!""
Who wrote this movie??? I'd like to get a piece of that guy!...The last 2 Jurassic parks were at least 2 hours long, this one had a running time of about 1:30 min, blatently showing us there really was no script at all in this rushjob paycheck of a movie.",1038960000,3,1730,4.151785714285714
1296600,4,B00003CXXR,"When ""Jurassic Park"" was released in 1993 it became very, very popular all around the world. It made over $900m worldwide and was a top video seller. Yet people still couldn't get enough of the Jurassic Park franchise. In 1997 when the sequal ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World was released it became the biggest opening weekend of all time, making over $70m in 1997. But unfortunately it didn't make as much money as the original, in fact it made more than $300m less! The reason for this could be that if you've seen it once, you've seen it a thousand times.
The first two films were original and had a very well thought out genre. When JP3 (Jurassic Park III) was released I went to go see it. Not alot of people were in the cinema! It seemed like no one was interested. But I was loyal and decided to see it. The beginning was not so great and it didn't give me the FEEL that the first and second film gave me, if you know what I mean.
The first two were exciting, scary and adventurous. Its true that Steven Spielberg did not direct this film, but was only the executive producer. I strongly feel that if Steven Spielberg instead of Joe Johnston directed the film it would of been a much more successful film. The film made over $180m domestically and over $350 worldwide. I know that Jurassic Park 4 will be released in 2005 by director Steven Spielberg and I'm sure it will surpass the original by the work of Steven Spielberg because he is the only one that can bring the JP genre back to the top of the charts.
JP3 starts off a little dingy but gets a little better during the plane crash and while they're stranded on the island. The new spinasaur dinosaur that they have designed is also a huge improvement. The filosoraptors have also been dramatically improved. I wonder why Same Niel was not included in the 2nd film and why Jeff Goldblum wasn't included in the 3rd film.
It is clear that JP4 will be much more successful with both actors in it. Maybe also add Sarah Michelle Gellar, she's got the moves, acting ability and look. The two children from the orginal film should also hopefully star in Jurassic Park 4. I cannot guarantee that you as an individual will enjoy this film. It still has lots of action and fun, but was unfortunately much shorter than the previous two films. In my opinion I suggest that you rent or buy this film over any new releases if you are a Jurassic Park fan!",1038700800,,2402,4.4

1296602,4,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park III"" is a good continuation of the Jurassic Park Series.  The film centers around a divorced couple played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni. Their son has been lost on Ilsa Sorna, In Gen's site B.  Their son was involved in a parasailing accident and landed on the island. Sam Neill reprises his role as palentologist Dr. Alan Grant.  He believes that he will merely be serving as a guide for the couple while the fly over the island, but Macy and Leoni have other ideas.  They portray themselves as rich adventurers while convincing Dr. Grant that they will make a large (and phony) donation to his archaeological society for his services.
However, unknown to Dr. Grant, the couple plans to actually land on Ilsa Sorna.  This is where the action and adventure begins.  Almost immediately, the group encounters a huge dinosaur, the spinosaurus, who makes the T-Rex from the earlier films look like a mouse. In fact, spinosaurus enjoys eating the T-Rex for dinner. The group tries desperately to avoid the menacing dinosaurs, find the couple's son, and somehow escape from the island. The dinosaur scenes are eye-popping, especially the flying pteranodons.  The airplane crash sequences are well-done, too.
I was a little disappointed in the ending.  It seemed to me that the producers of the film were just trying to hurry and finish the movie, so it was a little abrupt.  Overall, I thought this was a good movie.  The dinosaurs are bigger and scarier in this movie, and the action scenes are top notch.  I still enjoyed the original Jurassic Park and The Lost World a little more, though, because they were longer (JP III was only 90 minutes), and the endings were not as rushed.  I do recommend this movie.  It flows well with the earlier films of the series.",1038182400,,1777,4.749185667752443

1296634,3,B00003CXXR,"The main reason I like the Jurassic Park movies is because I like dinosaurs. I don't expect much from the story line/plot because the whole purpose of the movies is to show how dangerous dinosaurs would be if they were alive today. So, leave your critical thoughts about plot/story line and watch this movie to see dinosaurs run, fight, chase people, eat people, try to out-think people, etc. Several new dinosaurs are introduced--one of which is bigger and ""badder"" than t-rex. An interesting addition is a prop that saves everyones' lives in a direct confrontation with a group of raptors. As the people run from one dinosaur feeding frenzy to another, one can't help but admire the single-minded ferocity of the dinosaurs even as one thinks how silly that some people just scream and scream and never do anything constructive when faced with death. The interest in this film is wondering which dinosaur is going to jump the group next, and the film doesn't disappoint as one dinosaur after another attempts to destroy the group of people invading the dinosaurs' habitat. If you wonder why anyone would return to such a dangerous locale, the film does provide strong motivation for these people to be on the island. If you like to see dinosaurs in action and don't mind everyone except the main characters getting eaten, then you will enjoy this dinosaur-celebrating movie.",1035676800,,1375,4.931034482758621

1296637,2,B00003CXXR,"Except for maybe another fat paycheck, right?  That's about all I can figure for why a fine actor like Sam Neill returned to this fast-dying franchise for another go-around.  Now the 'Jurassic Park' movies in general require you to take on an enormous amount of disbelief, but even knowing this, this is an ugly, and pretty bad movie.  The original 'Jurassic Park' was a bona fide popcorn classic that I saw upwards of five or six times in the theater.  When the sequel 'The Lost World - Jurassic Park Part II' rolled around it was already starting to feel like the thrills were cheap and the cheese was being laid on a little thick, especially the ridiculous final quarter when it went stateside.  However, when I saw the trailer for this one, I was admittedly somewhat looking forward to it.
Now I and every other film buff should know by now that when a franchise is going on for a third chance, that you can't expect much from it, especially a thriller like this, that is, in some sense of the phrase, a natural disaster movie.  I mean how many times can these humans go back to this island, watch their friends get mauled and eaten, just BARELY escape themselves, and still, STILL have an inkling to go back.  Of course, you can't really blame Dr. Grant in this one, because he was kind of forced into the situation here, and William H. Macy and Tea Leoni just wanted their son back, but all the rest of 'em, good God, what're they thinking?
You can always tell who's going to become dinosaur food in these movies, because there's always a few characters thrown into the mix that don't seem to have any purpose at all, or that are as weakly-developed as you can possibly imagine, but in this one, it seemed everyone was expendable really.  I mean, I didn't care about any of them, except for Dr. Grant, and I almost wished he would die just to put him out of his misery.  Even the special effects in this one, handled once again by ILM, are weak and so obviously phony that the thrills are more laughable than anything.  To break it down for you, there was just too much cheese in this movie for me to stomach.  I'd say it definitely supports dairy.
I give 'Jurassic Park III' two stars for Sam Neill's performance, and for the sequence in the bird's nest, where the pterodactyls were pecking at the kid.  Pretty sad, huh?  One good thing I can say is that the movie was only about 89 minutes long compared to the two hours-plus that the others were.  The producers and screen writers must know that the material is getting stale.  I hope they don't make any more of these movies.",1033776000,5,2585,4.447033898305085

1296639,1,B00003CXXR,"The comparisons are right there. Every Jaws film was worse than the other, and The Jurassic Park series is going through the same pattern. Here is an example:
1 A) The Original Jaws: Landmark Film That set the bar in suspends, and sheer thrills. Directed By Steven Spielberg.
B) The Original Jurassic Park: Landmark Film That revolutionizes special effects, and combined them superbly with suspends, thrills, and heart. Also Directed By Steven Spielberg.

2 A) Jaws 2: A sequel That does not equal the original but manages to keep up the suspends and thrills. This was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who does not have the flare of Steven Spielberg but manages to keep up the pace set forth by the original.
B) The Lost World, Jurassic Park: A sequel that does not equal the original but manages to surpass it in the special effects department. Steven Spielberg directed this, and this is the first time he directed a sequel to one of his original movies. Although It does not come close to the magic of the original, it does retain the superb combination of Suspends, thrills, and heart.
3 A) Jaws 3 (also known as Jaws 3D): A bad cash in that is more of a gimmick that an actual movie. The gimmick in question is the rendering of 3D images over bad shark effects that tries to cover up the fact that the story is preposterous, and the acting is outrageously bad. This was Directed by Joe Alves, who proves with out a doubt that anyone with a camera can be a director, but talent is giving to a few.
B) Jurassic Park 3: A bad cash In that is more of a gimmick that an actual movie. The gimmicks in question are the discovery of a new dinosaur called the Spinosauris that was hiding from the other films of the series and the evolution of talking raptors. All this and a very short running was clear attempt to cover up the fact that there was really no story to be told, and the fact that acting is so glaringly bad gives a real indication of actors just trying to collect a check. Not even The special effects are up to expectation, and that shocking because it came from the same man who did the others movies in the series. This was directed By Joe Johnson Who previous outings includes Honey I Shrunk the kids and Jumangi were mediocre at best. (Word Of advice, Never Give over a franchise To a man name Joe)
I don't know about Jurassic Park 4 but if the pattern holds we will all see another Jaws The Revenge. If that happens then The Jurassic Park series is truly dead.",1032912000,4,2472,4.421052631578948

1296641,3,B00003CXXR,"I was disappointed the first time I saw this picture.  But that was at a drive in, where the picture quality was not great.  Plus the plot was paper thin:  Airplane crashes into dinosaur island, people try to get off dinosaur island.
But after getting it on video, I changed my mind a bit.  Yes, the plot is still just a vehicle for showing off the special effects. And they brought in some of the actors from the original, who must have been it strictly for the paycheck, as a way to keep the audience interested.  And I'm sure Steven Spielberg's role as producer consisted of a few long-distance phone book.
But I have to admit, it did hook me.  And I even like it better than the Part II.  The reason is that I didn't care for many of the characters in Part II.  Out of all the people to bring over from Part 1, Malcom was one of the least I was interested in.  so while they were in it for the paycheck, I at least had a bit of care left from Part 1.
But center stage has to be kept for the effects themselves.  You not only get a lot more minutes than the first film, but there has been an improvement in the quality.  When we see the pteradactyl coming out of the fog for the first time, it's truly creepy.  And it's also a film that keeps the kids interested.",1032480000,,1266,4.1016260162601625
1296642,2,B00003CXXR,"JURRASICK PARK III is a movie that I remember asking myself - did Sam Neil (Merlin, Bicentennial Man, Event Horizon) read the script before doing this? Yes it's got state-of the-art CG (Computer Graphics) dinosaurs and incredible integration of live-action, animation and animatronics but it didn't have the most important element, a story. Sam does an incredible acting performance as the `Dinosaur Man', but even he can't save this one. And now I know why Spielberg just produced this one.
The premise is very simple, two, not-to-intelligent people hang glide near the Isle's of Prehistoric land and one happens to be a very resilient child played by Trevor Morgan (The 6th Sense, The Patriot, The Rookie). Of course the two divorced parents played by Tia Leoni (The Family Man, Deep Impact, Hollywood Ending) and William H. Macy (Pleasantville, Boogie Nights, Air Force One) convince Sam Neil and young and impulsive scientist played by Alessandro Nivola (Inventing The Abbots, Love's Labor Lost, Carolina) to come along and the rest is completely predictable. The new twist is that the Raptors now communicate with each other and plan and plot. All they needed were suits and ties and they would lawyers. There were several eat-away characters (people that you don't know as talent that end up being Dinosaur lunch) that didn't stand out except the limited comic relief of the talent of Michael Jeter (The Green Mile, Patch Adams, Mouse Hunt ).
This one was directed by Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, October Sky, Jumanji  ) and it seems he went for the predictable sure camera style in giving us the threat of danger and it seemed the performances might have been pushed and more formula then natural and developed.
Technically the film is sharp and interesting to look at, but it reality it is a slow moving and typically cheats with camera moves and jump scares in very obvious places. Overall the young crowd will like the dinosaur attacks and actions but the adults, like me might yawn a little. (9-9-02)",1031788800,4,2011,4.949704142011834
1296663,2,B00003CXXR,"The end of the Lost World (a sequel 5 years after the original, most of us forget), a majestic mix of new and already seen dinosaurs move around in their natural habitat, leaving the story successfully finished with most of the loose ends tied up. We've had lots of monsters, lots of good lines, time to go home.
  But no. Hollywood won't let an idea die if there's money in it, and the first Jurassic Park was a minor turning point in cinema history - it's sequel was gory and fun enough to bring millions to the cinemas. So what the Hell, they figured. Make another one.
  This time, there's no complex Crichton book as a basis, so the plot consists of the following: Grant is brought to island to find kid; we see some new/old dinosaurs; various team-members get chomped; Grant finds kid, parents/kid re-united; everyone goes home, happy and safe. It isn't brain taxing stuff, and the film is all the weaker for it. For drama, Director Johnston depends on zoom-to-Niell shots for some stating-the-obvious-in-a-dramatic-fashion moments, e.g. ""He's calling for help"" or ""It's a birdcage."" A good device first time, but it's re-used throughout the film. Johnston's direction, also comprising of sped up action shots, looks cheesy and unsubtle, much opposed to the decent direction of the first two films.
  Then the special effects. Certainly not better than before as somewhere stated, the dinosaurs are in terrible shape. The T-Rex is green, the raptors are blue, when they're CGI they look CGI, when they're animatronic they're jerky and different to their computer counterparts... it's all very messy and seemingly unfinished, like some rushed B-Movie sequel. The much-talked-about Spinosaurus, like the Raptors (who get their own silly subplot of having an advanced system of communication which Niell has only just noticed) comes and goes with such lack of cohesion that you could forget he's in it. In fact, the only dinosaur that is in any way impressive is the Pteranadons... the scene on the ""birdcage"" is atmospheric, the only one of it's kind in the film.
  Aside from Sam Niell, Alessandro Nivola and the cameo-bound Laura Dern, there's only B-List actors here, and again it only increases the straight-to-video feel of it all. It's stricken with sequel-itis, promising only some new dinosaurs and a returning character, as we could have guessed. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, the film still feels padded and overlong, and it is, comprising one ""characters run from dinosaurs"" scene after another. Yawn.
  The movie simply didn't have to have been made, and there is nothing fresh or surprising about it. Direction, casting, effects, and ripped-from-the-previous-movies music all add up to make this a lame second sequel, that truly only fans will get anything out of - and even they will simply long to go and watch one of the two far better originals.

 Unfortunately, the plane crashes and the group becomes stranded. The rest of the movie becomes a race to see who will get off the island and who will become lunch for any number of big, bad reptiles. The plot is largely secondary however- the dinosaurs are the stars of this show, and the boy. Giving our plucky heroes most trouble are of course the Veliciraptors (who can now communicate-isn't evolution a wonderful thing?), although the tooth-baring Tyrannosaurus also proves to be a significant obstacle. Best of all, though, are the very scary Spinosaurus and the flying reptilian Pteranodons.

Sam Neil, who was great in the first movie, gives a horrible performance in the third and the rest of the cast follows suit with his example. The sad part about all of this is the fact that there was no hint of effort made to make this movie even remotely any good, it just looks like they were all just looking for a pay check.

Reflecting the same concept of how dangerous biotechnology can be when developed with greedy motivations and no real moral reasoning. This opinion is held by the film's lead character, Dr. Alan Grant, who is from the first movie, as well as Ellie Sattler. I was glad to see that they brought back these two favorites of mine, and found them to remain true to their original characters in Jurassic Park. Although it seems like Grant was slightly made into the Indiana Jones type, because there are segments that give similar impressions. Also, JP III has some situations that are reminiscent to the first film, which was nice.
Despite what anyone else thinks, I'm going to say that the acting in this film is great, I really love it, and Tea Leoni did an admirable job. The actions and reactions of all the characters appear completely natural, making it a believable experience to watch. Once again the dinosaur animation is outstanding! The raptors are truly amazing! The movie becomes quite unpredictable, with suspense that just won't quit. All seasoned with a bit of humor at the right timing. The scenes are excellent and the camera flow is superb, making use of some fantastic angles to tell the story. It just has a way of grabbing your attention through sight, sound and emotion.
I'm a DIE-HARD Jurassic Park fan, and even if I wasn't, I still think I would recommend this movie. Because it's just one bazaar thrill ride of narrow escapes for those of you who like disaster/survival adventures where man verses nature, (or in this case, beasts of terror.) It has no out right swearing, but still heed the PG-13 rating. Compared to the 2 previous films,  this one has some of the most gruesome images. It's a bit obvious that a sequel is to follow, and it seems too, that this film was made with the prospect of another theme park ride in mind. But these things didn't totally ruin the excitement of the movie. Personally, I think Jurassic Park III is a far BETTER sequel than the Lost World JP and wish I could double underline the word BETTER.
And oh yeah, even if you're somewhat of a Jurassic Park fan, don't hesitate a bit. Get this one on DVD or VHS; it won't be as disappointing as you might be lead to believe.",1029628800,5,2326,4.631961259079903

They actually want to find their lost child, but the plane crashes, so they are in danger, because the dinosaurs are everywhere, and this time, they are intelligent and have the capacity to communicate with each other. The group splits up in a moment, in which the boy finally appears, but they run up against the awful dinosaurs and they will have many problems from now to then.
This is the third part of the saga started by Steven Spielberg, and is undoubtedly the worst. When I saw it, I didn't get scared in any moment; because of the regrettable performance the actors did, above all, Ta Leoni's. They never seemed to be really shocked with the entire situation. Besides, all was so predictable and boring: the very forced crashing of the plane, the hunt, and the way they escape at the end. The special effects were nothing extraordinary, and the script looks to be written in a couple of minutes. In addition, its short length proves their effort at making this pitiful movie that is completely lacking of any good ideas.

1296713,3,B00003CXXR,"I think I can say with ease the Jurassic Park series is turning out better than the Jaws series.  That might not sound like  much praise, but this third go-round thriller is an enjoyable, albeit extremely brief, adventure set on Isla Sorna, AKA ""That second dino island.""  Brought back into the fold is Sam Neill's Alan Grant, who's now leading a small team on the island in search of a missing teen.
Yeah, the plot's thinner than ever, but what can I say?  I'd be lying if I said I watched this movie for its story. All I really ask for is that a lot of puny humans get chased around by dinosaurs and for the most part, this film delivers.  Sure, most of the characters are unlikeable (the only exceptions being Neill and his assistant, played by Alessandro Nivola) and annoying and the body count is too low, but the action sequences are well-choreographed and occasionally exciting.  As can be expected, the visual effects are first-rate, though the dinos appear a bit too CGI at times, even moreso than its predecessors.  The indoor settings offer more thrill potential (as witnessed in the original film), but director Joe Johnston seems to favor the jungle terrain, a bit of a disappointment.
At a 91-minute running time, the film never wears out its welcome, but then again, it doesn't properly build momentum, either.  Oh, well, at least it gets off to a quick start and never looks back.  Recommended for those looking for a quick-paced jungle adventure, but don't expect the suspense, thrills, or pure magic of the original.",1027728000,3,1534,4.715355805243446

It's a juvenile follow up that really makes it's processors look really bad, and that's a great feat considering the fact that the first two had a little thing called class. Steven Spielberg surrenders the directional control to Joe Johnson who proves with out a doubt how Spielberg is the master of filmmaking by his extremely lack of talent. There is no direction to be found here, and the confuse look of the actors involve is a clear indication of this. Sam Neil And William H Macy are two gifted actors who literally destroy their reputations with performances that clearly contradicts their talent, and the rest of the actors involve as just as bad. The is literally no sense of plot to go by, and there is no climax. The dinosaur effects are not even up to standard, and that's a sad case because it came from the same team that did the first two movies.

Somehow the couple of Paul and Amanda Kirby, played by the actors above, persuade Dr. Alan Grant, (Sam Neill), to overfly the second island, Isla Sorna, to view the dinosaurs, offering plenty of donation money to his cause in Montana on digging up fossils.
He goes along for the ride, and finds out the couple is not rich or common sense adventurers, but two divorced parents looking for their kid, lost on this island. The adventure starts here, with the dinosaurs including the T-Rex, Raptors, and Pterodactyls chasing the gang through the jungle. Good special effects, but the movie wheezed by, leaving only a vague memory of what happened.

1296755,1,B00003CXXR,"What an insult to my intelligence this film was. As a fan of Spielberg's work--and the biggest film critic in Milwaukee--I wasn't surprised that he wasn't at the helm for this picture. 'Jurassic Park III' shows the signs of every B movie I've ever seen, but dumbs even that down to a point where I could not help but laugh.
For starters, the plot for 'Jurassic Park III' was thin to the point where you forget fifteen minutes into the film what it was even about. Instead, you stare as our heroic characters run through the trees in fret, fleeing the approaching dinosaur...again.
'Jurassic Park' ranks as one of my favorite movies of all time, easily cracking my Top 25, which is an extremely difficult task. However disappointed I was with 'The Lost World' disappeared after viewing this sequel. Yeah, 'JP2' had its problems and was not as fresh as the original, but this film is simply a disaster. How much of this are we supposed to believe, anyway? I mean, if dinosaurs could exist again, I strongly doubt that a 12-year-old boy could survive for two months alone when in the original and 'JP2', dino experts with guns were no match for the beasts.
Also, the entire segment with the satellite phone was just jaw-dropping. Are we really supposed to believe that a phone will be audible when it's in the stomach of a dinosaur? I mean, chances are that it would have been destroyed when originally eaten, right? Yes, the entire movie follows this pattern.
This review doesn't even take into account the apparent lack of beginning, middle, climax and end to this film. In fact, at an hour and a half, that was probably the best part...it was forty minutes shorter than the first two, making my time of sitting around waiting for it to end greatly reduced.
And finally, the scariest thing about this film is the following: Spielberg wants to make more. I'm sorry, Mr. Spielberg, but Mr. Johnston ruined all credibility this series had...stick to NOT making sequels like you once did.",1023926400,5,1983,4.7011494252873565
1296756,2,B00003CXXR,"After a boy gets trapped on Isla Sorna whilst on an ill-conceived sight-seeing trip with his father a rescue party led by Sam Neill, making a return as Dr Alan Grant, sets out to bring the youngster (implausibly alive on an island populated by flesh eating dinosaurs) back to safety and guess what? They succeeed (now there's an original plot twist).
Having seen all three parts of the Jurassic Park trilogy, it has to be said that Jurassic Park III has moved the great Tyrannosaurus Rex of a movie franchise to almost certain extinction. Admittedly Joe Johnston's direction is efficient if unremarkable, give or take the odd set-piece or another and it's not as if Jurassic Park III is awful, it's just average. Very average. It has no real story or plot to speak of and the biggest problem is that we have seen it all before, with the exception of some new previously unseen dinosaurs (wow)! From the moment Sam Neill joins up with his motley crew of would-be rescuers to travel to Isla Sorna you already know or can at least accurately guess who is going to survive and who is going to die (and in which order).
Not even the return of the always excellent Sam Neill as Dr Alan Grant and the addition to the cast of William H Macy can do enough to add weight and intelligence to this tired old sequel. Ta Leoni is also wasted and is only required to scream hysterically from time to time in that old-fashioned stereotypical way that women in this kind of formulaic B movie are required to do. Alessandro Nivola, a fine young actor does his best too but with such a tired and weak script, no amount of talent was ever going to lift this movie above the ordinary. In fact I'd rather search for my mobile phone in a big pile of dinosaur manure than have to watch another shameless and storyless Hollywood cash in such as this one.",1023840000,4,1829,4.479041916167665
1296757,2,B00003CXXR,"I figured I have seen the first two, I might as well see this one too. It is better than the second film, and about on par with the overrated first film.
Sam Neill is tricked into going to the second island by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, who are looking for their missing son. A few supporting players go, too, to provide food for the dinosaurs without caring about the loss of their characters. There is lots of running, a climax that never happens, and the promise of another sequel.
Forgive the short synopsis, the truth is this film steals tons from the first two films. There is a ""dinosaur poop"" scene and a character supposedly dies and we must waste our time watching for him to appear hurt but alive.
I would compare this film to the awful ""Back to the Future Part II."" It was also released to kind of tie in to future episodes, and does not stand well on its own. If you are going to continue a major action franchise, you would think the third film would be even bigger than the first two. No such luck here.
The special effects run hot and cold. Good dinosaur graphics, but what is with the script? The film makers decided the audience wants nothing but dinosaur attacks, and throws in all sorts of them. These do not seem to take on any sort of breakneck speed, this just looks like a resume tape for Stan Winston's special effects. This is a greatest hits compilation of people getting chased, attacked, and eaten (in all its PG-13 gory glory) without any sort of suspense or scares. Action scenes would start, like the dinosaur at the steel fence, then end as the humans would just run away, talk, then get chased again.
Would everyone stop teaming Sam Neill with children? The teenage boy here is better than the lovey dovey cutesy wutesey duo from the first film, but I am sick of seeing his heart melted by youth. Speaking of youth, I literally cannot remember anything about Neill's young protege, Billy. His character is so vacuous and laid back, he disappears from the screen. I kept thinking ""who is that? oh, yeah, Billy with the stolen raptor eggs."" Macy and Leoni are okay, but better than this material.
If you have seen the first two, you might as well see this as well. It is not any good, but when has that stopped a major motion picture studio from shoving down your throats?

1296758,3,B00003CXXR,"With a Jurassic Park film, state of the art special effects are a given.  Each film features cutting edge technology of various kinds bringing to the screen the most exciting, realistic and scary dinosaurs possible at the time.  On that issue, JP III delivers the goods, and this time we also get flying dinos too.  Besides the reptiles, an interesting, credible, and less predictable story would have been nice.
Pressured by the need for funding, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) is improbably deceived into becoming a guide on a trip to the island Isla Sorna (Site B), by thrill seeking couple, William Macy and Tea Leoni.  The ""Kirbys"" are actually divorced, and are searching for their son Eric, who is apparently lost on the island, which is an unsupervised haven for Hammond's creatures.  Disaster strikes almost immediately after their plane touches down on the island, and soon the group is minus one plane and two crewmembers.  Only through the magic of film editing do the survivors manage to outrun both a T-Rex and a Spinosaur.  The survivors have cuts and abrasions after the plane crash, and it is a distraction, and continuity nightmare trying to insure that these injuries appear consistent thoughout the film.
If we are to believe what is presented, raptors are driven by an amazing instinct to protect their eggs.  And like man, they can kill for reasons other than for food or self-protection.  ""Human"" family values are also important, and young Eric is of course still alive, having survived alone for over eight weeks.  We never find out exactly what happened to Ben, who paraglided to the island with Eric.  The intimate family banter between the reconciling Kirbys might be engaging, if we really cared about them, but both characters are rather irritating, and ultimately responsible for putting everyone in danger.  The group enters an abandoned Jurassic Park facility where flying reptiles were bred.  Surprise!  The hungry pteranodons are still around, providing a new kind of dinosaur terror.  Laura Dern reprises her character from the original Jurassic Park, making a small but crucial appearance.
While JP III can be appreciated as a technical achievement, a well written story would have certainly been a big plus.  Well, maybe next time.  Most The DVD extras include a ""Making of"" feature, and a commentary track with special effects master Stan Winston, and members of the various effects teams.  This commentary is basically SE geek talk, consisting of a lot of technical information, with a hearty dose of complementary back slapping mixed in.

Jurassic Park films. Even so, JP3 is a riveting adventure film, set on a forest island filled with dinosaurs. The storyline concerns a thirteen year-old boy who becomes stranded on the dinosaur island in a motorboat crash. Then two tourists, a man and his wife, approach Alan Grant, a famous paleontologist, requesting that he fly them over the dinosaur island, for an aerial tour of the former Jurassic Park, now inhabited by living dinosaurs. But the tourists are not what they seem. The two tourists turn out to be the stranded boy's parents, determined to find their son. When Alan Grant refuses to land the plane on such a dangerous island, the tourist's companion knocks him out cold, then they land the plane. When a t-rex attacks the landed crew, they attempt to escape by taking off again. Instead, the plane crashes, and the crew finds themselves stranded. Now they must struggle to survive the dangerous island filled with dinosaurs.
Jurassic Park 3 is a must-see to anyone who is a fan of Jurassic Park. However, one does not have to be a Jurassic Park fan in order to enjoy this movie.

Back in a big way are the dinosaurs, the wild environments, and a handful of likeable people that you root for to get through it all.
Maybe that was the biggest problem with part 2, we didn't like the characters in the story, so we didn't care if they made it or not.
This is an enjoyable thrill ride that improves with additional viewings.  It still not as replayable as Jurassic Park, but it's a very watchable film.

Instead, you get big budget special effects, big bad dinos with an attitude, somewhat campy acting, and the perfect thrill ride for kids 12 and under. Another of the film's problems is the fact that this movie is WAY too short. It seems that the filmmakers said: ""OK, we have 90 minutes of footage, let's just tack on an ending and get it over with as soon as possible."" The abrupt ending felt odd and out of place. All that taken together makes JP3 the weakest entry in the entire Jurassic Park series. It's missing the magic touch that Spielberg gave to Jurassic park and The Lost World. So all in all, not a bad movie, just don't expect too much.

Every single part of this movie is fantastic. I had loved dinosaurs since I was a very little kid. I'm not planning to be a paleontologist or something but I think dinosaurs are fascinating since they're animals. And I love all animals!!! I respect them a lot, and had studied about them for more than 8 years (I'm 14 right now). This movie is like a true science, especially biology and paleontology. And I love to study those stuff.
When I began to get glimpses of this movie, I was gasped, thinking how could Joe Johnston could make such a film that could entertain so many people? The dinosaurs are so realistic, that I'm imagining if they're still existing somewhere around this planet. And I'm sure that Sam Neill was glad to be in this film. He looked like a true paleontologist. This movie isn't just amazing, but it's also hilarious in some parts. Such as when this pilot name Nash sprays some paints on a old plane to resemble a shark, and then Cooper blows it up. I cracked up so much on that!! The music is great. John Williams is a true maestro.
What about dinosaurs?? They looked like truly real animals. It seems like there are more variety of dinosaurs than other two films. The Spinosaurus was great, terrific, I'd say. It's very good that the director put a larger carnivore than t-rex, because although rex is a symbol for jurassic park, it also tells that carnivores larger than rex did existed. Both rex and Spinosaurus were amazing. The battle between those two carnivores were great. Boy, Stan Winston sounded like if he's a dinosaur cloner, since he made them look like so realistic. Raptors were fantastic. The way they acted, the way they talked, the way they kill, etc. It seems like their coloration is changed little more than in two previous movies, which was pretty cool. It also looked like they were recieving feathers. Compys were little too short, but ok. The part where all these Corytosaurus and paras run in herds was magnificent, as they thundered the earth. For rest of herbivores, Brachiosaurs were astonishing. I knew that they were huge, more than 20 m. long, but I never thought they could be that huge!!! For ankylosaurs, it was pretty cool, watching them crunching on leaves. Man, I don't think adult ankylosaurs have any enemies. Their entire body is armored, including spikes on eyelids!!!!! Stegosaurus and other herbivores were little disappointing. They were too little shown. And that ceratosaurus, it was so funny!! The dinosaur ran away just because that the excrements stunk, instead of attacking people.
The pterosaur was incredible. Although they aren't dinos, they still lived with dinosaurs. Pteranodons were third largest of pterosaurs, and that's the one shown in this movie. Quetzalcoatlus is the largest, then ornithocheirus. Watching them snatching people out of ground just amazed me. They were lot more vicious than I thought!!
Everyone in the cast seems like did an excellent job, especially Sam Neill. That boy Trevor Morgan was so funny when he answers ""you don't want to know"" to Grant's question, and Grant had asked him how had he got t-rex's urine.
Few parts were disappointing and could be little better. They could show more of the herbivorous dinosaurs, more compys, and the most strange thing is that I didn't saw triceratops!!!...It seemed like the producers spent too much time on vicious carnivores, rather than herbivores. But that's that, and it doesn't really matter.
This movie is truly exciting, edge-of-the-seat plot...It's a one heck of a amazing film...",1017360000,,3677,4.866028708133971
1296786,3,B00003CXXR,"This is a fairly decent film.  Dinosaurs, mayhem, and action are all abundant but . . ..  The reasons for the continued contact with the dinosaurs is especially thin in this movie.  Not only that, they've stretched the believability factor too much when it comes to the intelligence of the Raptors.  It was bordered on laughable.  Also stretching the imagination and the plot is one large dino that follows the stranded characters everywhere.  Amazing how a dino as big as two buildings could sneak up on you repeatedly with success.  He even manages to hide in some rather shallow water.  There are so many inconceivable occurrences in the movie that I can give it only 3 stars.  It's a very disappointing contribution to the series.

1296788,1,B00003CXXR,"First a confession: I watched this with the preconception that sequels, ESPECIALLY the third of a series, are nonsense. So far only Back to the Future 3, Last Crusade and Return of the Jedi have disproved the rule. But JP3 does not. I will be brief, as was the film.
  The plot is typically brainless for a sequel, and even with a story it feels as though we're just wandering from one contrived action sequence to the next. The other two films set up conventions (ie these characters die, these don't) and now we know what to expect... so when half the plane crew get eaten, it comes as no surprise.
  The cast are passable. Niell and Nivola are excellent, but much as they appear as the only dinosaur experts in the story, they also seem to be the only credible actors. They are surrounded by William H. Macy, doing that-nice-American-guy he does in every film, and Tia Lioni, loud, annoying... B-List! Alan's loathing of being involved is more than felt by us.
  And the effects... Personally, I've heard a lot of praise. But why? The computer-dinosaurs really LOOK like computer-dinosaurs, in all their out of place glory. And the model dinosaurs have such slow, jerky movements that make them reminiscent of the stop motion Harryhausen movies that paved the way for Jurassic Park. These effects are awful!
  And the Spinosaurus. Included purely for the sake of having another dinosaur, with no explanation (even Niell points out that Spinosaurus shouldn't be there), it is a strange creature, and if it weren't the main monster, we would wonder why it follows the cast throughout. The fight with the T-rex is disconcerting... at this point, I realised I was rooting for the T-rex! It's death more than symbolised the direction this film was taking Jurassic Park.
  And the hideously under-developed raptor idea... what was that again? They're intelligent? Clearly forgotten during script-writing, the idea is picked up again at the end for a last minute confrontation. And then a rushed end, everyone is happy, the dinosaurs are back in the jungle where they can't hurt anyone... and we're left wondering what the point was.
  Perhaps it's thankful that it was only 90/100 minutes. It was stretched at that, too.",1016928000,,2217,4.8514588859416445

There is not even a hint of a plot any where in this movie, and the dino effects look like [...junk].  The direction is a joke, and the pace of the film is too fast to even make sense of what is happing from one scene to the next.

The only fun I had during this thankfully short piece is watching Tea Leoni's (sp?) facial expressions. Surely the worst actress I have ever seen in any film in history. She's appauling, so is the film. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Don't waste your time or money.",1016150400,3,548,4.435643564356436
1296811,3,B00003CXXR,"Sequels are a mainstay in the movie business these days. Studios call them franchises, and they can be extremely profitable. Entire seasons, especially summer, are built around them. Coming next summer, for example, are Men in Black 2, Austin Powers 3 and the fifth Star Wars. How frenzied has this trend become? Warner Brothers started filming the second Harry Potter movie before the first one even opened. New Line made all three Lord of the Rings books into movies simultaneously and will release them over the next three Christmas seasons.
This brings us to Jurassic Park 3. It's arguably the best in the series, an old-fashioned monster movie that gets straight to the point. It's as lean and coolly efficient as the dinosaurs it portrays. Everything its human characters do and say moves the story along briskly. It could be used in film schools as a model of commercial film making. Yet, because its a sequel, most viewers will have a 'been there, done that' reaction. The novelty of computer generated graphics has worn off. Seeing people interact on screen with giant and often dangerous creatures from the past is no longer so thrilling. Jurassic Park 3 still made a ton of money, but people went to it with naturally lowered expectations.
This time the action takes place on Isla Sorna, which was the one where all the genetic experiments took place. The project has been abandoned, and the place is strictly off limits to almost everyone. This doesn't stop Eric's [Trevor Morgan] stepfather from paying a crew to take them hang gliding over it. Of course, disaster strikes, and they get trapped on the island. Eric's parents, Paul and Amanda [William H. Macy and Tea Leoni], posing as wealthy tourists, trick paleontologist Alan Grant [Sam Neill] and his assistant, Billy [Allesandro Nivola], into flying with them over the island. The researchers are shocked and surprised when the plane actually lands on dinosaur-infested Sorna. Alan went because the couple wrote him a big check to refund his research back in America. He did not plan on being part of a search and rescue mission in a place he vowed never to return to.
The movie wisely introduces some new creatures, the most effective of which are spinesaurus, a dinosaur even larger, uglier and hungrier than T-rex, and some giant carnivorous birds. They also give the hideous raptor dinosaurs much more intelligence, which make them even more formidable adversaries. Still, after a while, once you've seen one bad-tempered dinosaur, you've seen them all.
Loving attention as been paid to recreating the look of these prehistoric beasts. For the most part, they mirror how many scientists imagine they look. In all three movies, how these dinosaurs behave is another thing. Maybe a carnivore would eat you, maybe it wouldn't. Would you risk finding out if you are on the menu? As in real life, every character in these movies instinctively runs away from them. Yet, all the herbivores are treated like they are gigantic puppies. That makes no sense to me. Wild elephants and rhinoceroses are herbivores. If you walked into their territory, do you think they would just stand there? Listen to me, kids. Herbivore does not always equal non-aggressive. If an animal is bigger and stronger than you are, show some respect.",1015804800,2,3288,4.958333333333333
1296812,4,B00003CXXR,"I just love it when dinos eat people, effects maestro Stan Winston says with obvious glee in his commentary for the Collectors Edition DVD of Jurassic Park III. Winstons people eaters are once again the stars of the Jurassic franchise, but this time out theyve evolved into voracious scenery chewers as well. Not only are the beasts far more lifelike than any Winston and his collaborators have created, but some display acting chops via individual voices, looks and expressions, the filmmakers say. These advances in dino drama are on full view in the special sections of the Jurassic Park III DVD, giving viewers a chance to dig as deeply into the creative process as they wish. The DVD comes widescreen or full frame, with both 5.1 DTS and Dolby sound.
 The picture is up to big-budget action film standards, with deep greens and nicely saturated blues predominant. The sound mix roars along with the critters, the subwoofer steadily amping up the anxiety level. The 5.1 mix effectively renders the action without calling attention to itself. The Jurassic teams craft is examined in several special DVD features: Turntables offer computer images of various dinosaurs that can be viewed from all sides. A featurette on the making of the dinos focuses on new beasts such as the Spinosaurus -- but repeats too much material from the so-so making of promo. Tours of Stan Winston Studios and ILM give more detailed insights into the creative process.
The disc features some great scenes of the cast and crew working with the mechanical dinosaurs that were later coupled with the CG creatures. Winston, Taylor and several colleagues provide the film commentary, which starts strong but runs out of gas by the third act. Much time is spent pointing out which scenes are live action, which are CG and which are effects quilts. Even the effects pros seemed confused by the blend at times. Unfortunately, the Jurassic DVD also breaks some new ground in promotion. A special feature link leads to screens full of pitches for Universal parks and Jurassic products. The carney approach grates, lowering the overall level of what is otherwise a pretty good DVD.",1015286400,,2150,4.955678670360111
1296813,3,B00003CXXR,"Plot and purpose take a backseat in the third addition to the ""Jurassic Park"" series. The obvious motivating factor for the production of the film was money, not devotion to the art of filmmaking. Despite that fact, I stll cannot help but enjoy this exciting and fun science fiction adventure ride. It works just fine as that--a fun science fiction adventure ride.
Paleontolgist Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from the original JP) reluctantly agrees to accompany an adventuresome husband and wife tandem (amusingly portrayed by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni), as their guide on a safe distance airplane tour over Isla Sorna, the island still inhabited by the genetically engineered dinosaurs. Things heat up when, to Grant's dismay, they land the plane and reveal their true motive--to rescue their young son who was lost on the island after a glider flight went terribly wrong. All out run-like-the-wind-from-the-dinosaur-on-your-tail action ensues.
While bordering on the silly side at times, and lacking the novelty of the original, it introduces new dinosaurs, elements, ideas and sequences that you wished were in the preceding films, most notably, a thrilling pteranodon sequence where the flying dinosaurs swoop down and ensnare helpless human victims. Theories about the velociraptors' intelligence, briefly touched upon in the prior films, are given a more coprehensive exploration here, as well. And the 16ft spinosaurus is truly a spectacle to see; its ferocity rivals that of the t-rex!
Although it lacks the Spielberg touch (directed by Joe Johnston a la ""The Rocketeer""), it contains enough state of the art visual effects, spectacular cinematic scenes, wit and surprises to entertain. The climax is a satisfying is one.",1014940800,,1745,5.326086956521739
1296814,3,B00003CXXR,"Hands up if you thought The Lost World wasn't up to much? Yeah, me too.
Funny though, after the experience of seeing this third dinosaur movie, I'm nostalgically itching to see the second one again. Because I remember that, despite a crummy story thinly spread amongst too many characters, it was at least directed by Steven Spielberg, who knows a thing or two about making entertainments of this sort.
The script let him down, but the film was crammed full of little moments, details and touches that evinced his magic touch. Let's face it, Julianne Moore face down on the slowly cracking glass door was a how-to in movie tension. But more importantly, Spielberg viewed the dinosaurs as a behaviourist, always insisting on their status as animals, giant fish out of water merely reacting to their unnatural circumstances in the only way they know how. It made the dinosaurs sympathetic, kept buoyant the theme of man playing God, and it made for very convincing special effects.
Jurassic Park III is a monster movie, pure and simple. A little too simple. The technology has advanced to allow CG creatures many times more versatile than before, but somehow they seem flatter. If proof were needed that CGI is nothing without the skill to wield it, then it is here.
The half hour amputated from the running time-- presumably in a panic that the film would bomb-- would have been better spent supplying the actors with actual characters to work with and enriching the audience experience with people to give a toss about.
But I don't mean to be too cruel about Jurassic Park III. On its own terms, it's enjoyable enough and far from poor of its type. Unfortunately, its terms are not its own, but those of someone who did much, much more with a dodgy rubber shark nearly thirty years ago.",1014768000,3,1786,4.745980707395498
1296815,3,B00003CXXR,"In June, 1993, Universal Pictures released ""Jurassic Park"". It produced $357 Million in sales, the 5th highest grossing movie of all time. Later they made a sequel. 2001 gave us ""Jurassic Park III"", a return to the land of ""winkin, blinkin, and nod"", with bigger and badder dinosaurs than ever before. Paleontologist Alan Grant is lured to Isla Sorna, a remote Costa Rican island, to help search for a boy lost in the jungle. He accompanies the boy's father and ex-wife. Their plane crash-lands, and this energetic thrill-ride is ready to begin.  The brilliant, breathtaking opening sequence sets the tone, as two parasailing tourists' vacation is jolted by unseen monsters from an ancient past.  But what's wrong with ""JP III""?  Not the effects. Just the story. Sam Neill returns as Alan Grant, the confident leader. Tea Leoni and Bill Macy play the divorced couple trying to re-ignite their fallen marriage. But there's no chemistry here. Leoni's character is a shrill bimbo housewife. You just don't care about these people. Laura Dern is wasted in a small role. The real star of ""JP III"" is the spinosaurus: the largest(60 feet) meat-eating dinosaur that ever lived(bigger than T-Rex). The super-star is the excellent effects(animatronics, rotoscope, and CGI). ""JP III"" was lushly filmed on three islands in Hawaii, off Palos Verdes, Cal., around Los Angeles, Universal sound stages and back lot, and even Fallow Lake(used in 1954 for ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""). This new DVD is anamorphic widescreen 1.85:, and features a haughty commentary by Stan Winston and the effects crew. You also get photos, clips, interviews, a short on an actual dinosaur dig in Montana, and scenes of participants riding Jurassic Park theme ride at Universal City. As undeveloped movie characters lose your interest, the dinosaurs and cinema magic take over. An early scene tells it all: Alan Grant and his aide disembark from their damaged plane on the island. Suddenly a frightening roar bellows from the jungle.  Grant's sidekick says: ""Oh no. It's Tyrannosaurus Rex!""

Our dear friend Billy just got eaten alive in front of our eyes, but hey did you catch that Mets game?  Of course all the characters that are central to the 'plot' survive.  Can anyone tell me why a 35 foot tall dinosaur even cares about a human that wouldn't even offer enough food to get stuck between it's teeth?  It would care even less with all the 'fight' that such a small calorie intake is putting up.

1296819,3,B00003CXXR,"Running...screaming...yes, all is as it should be in a good dinosaur romp. The trouble is that there isn't much else to this film, but if you're just looking for a little mindless entertainment that'll have you glancing nervously out your windows at night, this will do, as the Spinosaur is pretty darned terrifying, what with being larger than the T-Rex, and having hands and arms and whatnot. There is naturally a lot of suspense in the film, which of course result in the deaths of all the Red Shirts.
They really should have either left out the plot entirely, and gone with only the primal fear factor, rather like a roller coaster ride, or they should have picked up their ... and written an actual reasonable plot that held water. What they presented in the storyline department was simply abysmal. There is incredibly weak dialogue, and human acting that is, for the most part, outdone by the lizards. Sam Neil, whom I normally like, was pretty awful.
The dinosaurs, though, were outstanding; the animation is fabulous. They really do look real enough to reach out and touch, even moreso than the previous JP films. I'm a little annoyed, though, with the treatment of the T-Rex and the Raptors. The T-Rex has an exceedingly brief cameo in JP3, during which it battles and is killed by the Spinosaur, just to prove how tough the Spinosaur is. I was peeved that they felt they had to demonstrate how much scarier the Spinosaur was by having it whomp the poor old T-Rex, whose scare factor must have dropped since they used it in the previous two movies, and we needed
something *even scarier*.
Scarier.
Than a T-Rex.
...Huh?
But ok, whatever, so there's a new bully in town, and he's hungry. Fine. Let's talk about the Raptors, shall we? The Raptors were very scary in the previous two films, without a doubt. But now, oh no! We've underestimated their intelligence and capacity for communication!! Whatever will we do? Well, for starters, we'll steal their eggs and make ourselves bait, how's that? Ok, steal eggs; check. Make selves bait; check. Run through the jungle like crazed weasels making a lot of racket; check. Yes, we're pretty much guaranteed to get eaten...unless! By gosh, it's so crazy that it just....might....work!! You can almost hear Joel from MST3K speak the ""alpha"" Raptor's line for him: ""Talking humans?!"" [slapping forehead] The way they escaped the Raptors actually made me say, quite audibly into the dark and crowded theatre, ""ARRRGH!!"" Looking to my left and right revealed either confusion (""What's her problem?"") or total sympathy (""Amen, sista."") The whole Raptor thing in JP3 was a tired old cliche that they were trying to make scary again. Sure sure, they're lurking everywhere. Sure sure, they're smart as hell. Yawn...
A huge unexplained plot point is how the heck these new species got there in the first place. Neil, at one point, acknowledges ""yup, these surely weren't on InGen's list o'critters,"" and one might think they'd eventually work their way back around to explaining it, but oh well. ...
I won't go any further, but there are others.
Overall? Somewhat disappointing on a fully-satisfying scale, but it had me clenching the arms of my chair in suspense a couple of times, much to my own surprise. It needed more of the whole ""impact tremor"" thing the first movies made good use of - but that's a personal thing, I just happen to find big, huge, footsteps from an unseen large-toothed predator absolutely terrifying.

1296850,5,B00003CXXR,"The Jurassic Park trilogy started in 1993 with the first movie directed by Steven Spielberg. In 1997, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, sequal followed which was also directed by Steven Spielberg. Then in 2001 the movie continued with more action and more dinosaurs then ever. Jurassic Park 3, however, was not directed by Steven Spielberg who decided to produce it but directed by Joe Johnston. This sequal provides more action than the first two movies. Also the dinosaurs in it are more realistic and more dangerous than ever before. The special effects are also much better.
Jurassic Park 3 satrts off with a boy and his step-father parasailing off the coast of Isla Sorna, the island on which The Lost World takes place. After going through some fog the parasailers look down out the friends on the boat but all they see is smeared blood over the side of the boat. They start to panic. They look ahead and see that the boat is going to crash into some rocks so the father cuts the rope and they head to the island.
The movie then cuts to Dr. Grant who was is the first one. He is talking to his friends who is played by Laura Dern(they both come back after staring in the first one together). As the story goes on Dr. Grant encounters a adventure seeking couple(played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni). They want Dr. Grant to be their tour guide as they fly over Isla Sorna. Dr. Grant says no but then they offer to pay him as much as he wants, so he agrees to go.
Along with him Dr. Grant takes his friend Billy along with him. When they arrive at the island they fly above it for a while and then tell the captain to land. Dr. Grant then yells in protest. He tells them they canno land on this island because it is too dangerous. They then punch him and he becomes unconcious. When he wakes up he hears the wife yelling a name. When he asks what she is doing they say that it was their that was one of the parasailers. She keeps yelling and he tells her to stop because itss a bad idea. Then they hear giant footsteps. Uh-oh! THey all run into the plane and start it. They go down the run way when one of the piolets runs out of the woods telling them to stop and get him. Knowing they can't they keep going. All of a sudden a dinosaur runs out and eats him justs as the plane lifts off. The dinosaur then makes the plane go into the woods and it crashes. Then the dinosaur appears and reaches into the cockpit and eats one of the piolets. THe dinosaur then kicks the plane and it starts to roll. Then the dinosaur, getting fed up runs away, and the passengers get out.

But luckily, in this 3rd outing, Jurassic Park is still a picnic thanks to the competent direction Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk The Kids and Jumanji).  Many of the crew from the first 2 films return.  And there's some good star power thrown in with William Macy, Tea Leoni and Michael Jeter; also, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are back.  It must be said that the new dinos are delectable!  There are still the scene-stealing special effects.  Some of these moments are jaw droppingly gorgeous.  A battle scene near the beginning goes on my list of favorite movie moments.  We've come a long way since those battle scenes in the 1930s King Kong.
There's also some wonderful dino-facts used in the film so pay close attention.  The smartness of the Raptors is quite interesting.  As for the characterizations,  I'd change Leoni's character to be more emotional about poor old Ben.  At least greave a little before going to the next situation.  In fact, modern movies tend to give all the characters the attention span of your average 5 year old.  How else could you stand there joking around when only a short time before a member of your party was torn apart by a razor-toothed lizard.  But...it's a movie!  It's fun!

The new director, Joe Johnston, makes the movie an enjoyable thrill ride, much like the first in the series, with action from start to finish.  And, because they are the REAL stars of the movie, we are introduced to a new dinosaur, even more terrifying than the towering T-Rex.  The Spinosaurus is an incredible new edition to the menagerie of dinosaurs that we've come to expect in these movies.  This is a good dvd and a nice companion to the other two.  I recommend it as a really good adventure film.",1013558400,,706,4.519685039370079

The dinosaurs are more colorful than ever, which I think is a better visual than the other two Jurassic Parks, the animals now have colorful stripes and distinctive markings.  Jurassic Park III is only a preface to a better yet Jurassic Park IV (hopefully).  This is one set of sequels that are acutally getting better, not worse!",1013040000,,507,5.0843373493975905
1296859,3,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park was entertaining, but The Lost World (which was the 2nd film) was a stinker. Jurassic Park III, I feel, is the best of the trio, presenting itself in the traditional formula of classic Hollywood films. The first two movies featured people invested with exotic professions in one sense or another. Granted that's usual even in classic Hollywood. This version, however, pits everyday people (basically the family involved) with the ferocious nature of the island. It increases the tension. The addition of William H. Macy, one of our most enjoyable contemporary actors, adds significantly to the mix. Would anyone have survived if the situation had been real? Probably not. JPIII is just good pulp action melodrama. Shorter than its predecessors (at c. 90 mins.), the screenplay is lean and to the point. The boat that they find and use to travel down river reminds me of something out of a Joseph Conrad story. I highly recommend this underrated film for pure fun and thrills.",1012780800,,989,5.0
1296890,4,B00003CXXR,"This third entry in the Michael Crichton-inspired dinosaur series is the first of these not directed by Steven Spielberg (he having gone on to do the more ambitious A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE). Instead, Spielberg left it in the hands of director Joe Johnston (JUMANJI, OCTOBER SKY) and served only as executive producer. Though the suspense that was very prominent in the first two JURASSIC films is less palpable here, the dinosaurs are every bit as spectacular and frightening as ever.
The film involves Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) once again having to come face to face with genetically engineered dinosaurs, only this time at the behest of an estranged couple (William H. Macy, Tea Leoni) whose son has disappeared on Isla Sorna, a.k.a. Site 'B', some 200 miles west of Costa Rica. There, they and a few others must find the couple's son (Trevor Howard) and stay alive long enough to get off the island. In-between, they encounter every kind of dinosaur they can and cannot imagine, including a Spinosaurus.
Johnston, who also served as aerial design director on Spielberg's unjustly maligned 1989 film ALWAYS, directs JURASSIC PARK III efficiently enough; nothing is taken away by pointing out that he isn't Spielberg. John Williams' famailiar JURASSIC PARK themes make an appearance on the soundtrack, which otherwise features a wholly original score by Don Davis. Featuring a cameo by Laura Dern, repeating her role as Ellie Sattler, and enough hair-raising moments to satisfy, JURASSIC PARK III is not quite at the level of its two predecessors, but it also isn't a terrible film by any means.",1012348800,,1603,5.075757575757576

Her son gets lost on an island while parasailing with his biological father. They hire people (Sam Neill among them) to  help them search this dinosaur-filled island.  It's been quite a few years since they saw him last, but they know he's alive. Of course they run into some problems with the dinosaurs, but nothing Sam can't handle--right?

In fact I almost felt cheated when I spent eight dollars on a ticket to go see this movie. Everything that was on the second movie was here but this movie is so predictable. It's almost like watching a scrapped version of the original movie. As a fan of the first two Jurassic Park Movies this was a bitter pill to swallow.

One complaint I have is that a certain times in the movie, the dialogue is so soft I was increasing the volume control to heard what was being said. Then the animals would appear and the volume was much too loud. You would think that the film people would have a solution for this.

3. Fake backrounds
4. Lets down the series immensly
5. The film is run by the simple basis of the characters running from dinosaurs.
6. Bone crunchingly boring
7. i have to save this particular scene for last sam neil is in a sandy area on jurassic island suddenly four raptors run up to him they surround him like they do in cartoons as if they were in the wild west all the while the backround and the raptors are extremly fake then a small child runs to the rescue with cannisters of tear gas which he throws that scares the dinosaurs away....

1296910,3,B00003CXXR,"While this film contains technological advancements over the first two and presents the return of Sam Neill, the franchise seems to have run out of ideas and resorts to one big game of dodge the dinosaur.  I guess they figured that it is better to have no story than a stupid story (see JPII).  Dr. Allen Grant (Neill) is tricked into returning to dinoland by a couple trying to find their son, who was lost on the island in an inane parasailing accident in the opening scene.  Once there, it is the movie version of ""Survivor"" where the creatures carnivorously vote the cast off the island.  The chase begins very early in the film, pre-empting any hope of a meaningful storyline.
Director Joe Johnston started his career as an art director, doing visual effects for ""Star Wars"", so it is no surprise that this film emphasizes visual effects.  In this respect it is superlative.  The integration of computer generated images and animaltronics is state of the art and brings us a realism that could barely be surpassed by being amidst the dinosaurs in real life.  They have improved the look and movement of the dinosaurs and have integrated them more realistically with the actors.  Despite having a lower entertainment value from a screenplay perspective, this film is pure genius as regards visual effects and uses vanguard techniques that will surely become commonplace in sci-fi films of the future.
There is not much to be said about the acting.  There isn't much meaningful dialogue.  All the actors are effective at looking terrified and then looking relieved only to be terrified again five minutes later.
The only way I can rate this film is to average two components.  The story is a 2/10 and the technical component is a 10/10.  So I'd have to give it a 6/10.  It is worth seeing just for the visuals, but don't waste your time if a strong screenplay is your primary consideration in selecting a film.",1011398400,,1913,4.743202416918429

It's quite a change of pace from its two predecessors. It takes getting used to. There is actually a much more solid plot line and even character development evident from when I first saw it.

The Dvd has three screens of special features including theatrical trailers for all three films, audio commentary by the special effects team and lots of behind the scenes footage.

It may have not done the business in the cinema the way the first two of the series did, but Johnston's replacement of Spielberg as Director is a seamless one.
So you might say that what can a 3rd instalment about pre-historic creatures give us that has not already been done before? This movie gives you an elaborate answer. With the return of Sam Neill as Alan & special guest appearance from Dern, this movie feels like the true sequel to the first instalment.  Taking place on another dino-infested island, Neill guides Macy & Leoni et al through a ravenous island where beast are free to live in their natural habitat - hence creating a few scares on the way.  Most notable is the introduction of the Spinosaurus Egypticus - the biggest & fiercest carnivor of them all - there's a gripping battle with the movie's hitherto principal antihero, T-Rex & an amusing scene with a satellite phone. A true movie gem.  The outcome of the sequence leaves you in no doubt as to who the mother of all dinos are.  Velociraptors are back with a vengeance & with an evolutionary edge.  The film builds on suggestion that the most evil of the Jurassic age was a communal beast that had its own developed communication skills.  We watch in horror as they track down & kill the human visitors.  My fave scene of the movie is the Birdcage sequence which is thrilling & fantastic to watch.
You get an overall sense that the movie's creators have sought to give their audiences new chunks to bite into - mainly about evolution & man's battle against temptation.  I was thoroughly satisfied by the movie's direction & edge.  Certainly there were parts missing.  The ending was too rapid & everything works out between Neill & his ingenu assistant - but hey it's the movies & the film does not profess to be Einstein's sibling.
Add to a cracking movie a series of in-depth featurettes & behind the scenes footage & you have a whopper of a DVD which succeeds not only in the fun & brilliance of the movie, but the quality of the package as a complete synthesis of the movie from pre-production.  A guilty pleasure which I'm glad I bought",1009756800,4,2317,4.540865384615385
1297005,2,B00003CXXR,"My issues with this movie involve its relationship to the source material. What a movie they could have made had they stuck to the spirit of the video game. Why didn't they--wasn't the game a success? And what made it a success--the design, the feel, the character of Lara Croft as originally concieved, that's what. The movie is SO not the game that they might just as well have named it Georgia Jones and the Temple Of Doom. The game makers carefully created a world and a character to dwell within it: a cool light intriguing arena with a compact sexy protagonist. She confronts a series of challenges with quick ingenuous single minded perseverence. Now comes this clamoring corporate cinematic contraption. Angelina Jolie's presence is sultry and inner dwelling and somewhat passive, which is good in itself but misses the steel trap reflexiveness of the original character creation completely. Also, the video character seemed to be of indeterminate race, only partly white. Then they ladle on the paranormal new age back story. Worst of all, Jolie is rarely more than a few yards from good and bad men for the run of the flick, even if the film makers have to drag out her dead father to gaze upon her her supple flesh. She's never allowed to act out the original character's calling--to get into and out of a series of delimas ALL BY HERSELF, as a strong resourceful modern young woman. The ""real"" Lara Croft is a sleek sexy problem solver, not some smoulderingly sensual pampered history sleuth with oedipal yearnings and an over-endowed, lanky body.

I hope you all enjoy the brand new dinosaur they have loaded for this film.,1009584000,,404,4.5479452054794525

I ended up buying 2 copies (will return both if I can't get a solution to my problem)and the only soundtrack that I could get to work was in FRENCH!  I watched the entire movie with subtitles.
I though the movie was ok.  I thought the first two Jurassic Parks [stunk], so I didn't expect much.  The first two were a little too Indiana Jonesish for me.  You know, all kinds of action but no one really gets hurt.  This one I thought was the best of the bunch, but I had to watch it in FRENCH!  I don't know French, I studied Latin in school (thank God it wasn't in Latin!!)

1297009,3,B00003CXXR,"Was this a Gilligan's Island episode with really good special effects? I think so. The films plot can be summed up as follows: Boy is stuck on island for EIGHT weeks and SURVIVES, while a group of adults lead by a PALEONTOLOGIST can barelly make it out of the dinosaur infested island and they're only there for a little over twenty four hours. Give me a break.
Sam Neill (who did a great performance in JP), William H. Macy, and Tea Leoni, whom are all ""A"" list stars don't deliver a convincing performance, partly because they filmed JP3 without a FINISHED script!
Now there are a lot of ways you can look at this movie, and I choose to look at it as an action flick and nothing more. The SFX were good, except for some scenes with the animatronic Spinosaurus, and the pteranodons were great. But the film is very dissapointing compared to its predecessors.
While the raptors got smarter, the plot got dumber. If the raptors were so smart, they wouldn't have signed on for this sorry sequel.",1009497600,,993,4.522222222222222

In the Lost World the script had very little to do with the book and ended up as a combination special effects fest and theme park promo. I found the plot in Jurassic III to actually make some sense for the most part and the Dinosaurs were incredible. I even thought most of the characters were good, the mercenaries weren't as smart as they thought they were and they certainly paid the price. The boy surviving on his own would be a little of a stretch, Dr. Grant's assistant making it to the coast without them is the least likely thing I saw in the movie, maybe more than Grant's former assistant (Laura Dern in a cameo role)calling in so much military help.",1009411200,,785,4.3108108108108105
1297033,3,B00003CXXR,"THE STORY: Sam Neill reprises his part as Dr. Alan Grant from JP. Thios time, millionaire Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife (Ta Leoni) ask him to guide an adventure trip in a plane over Isla Sorna, where INGEN engineered the dinosaurs. But the Kirbies are planing on landing the plane on the island in order to find their son, who was last seen paraglyding over Isla Sorna. Now, they're hunted by the islands inhabitants as they conduct their search..
THE CAST: Somehow I couldn't shake off the feeling that they all did it for the money. The actors seem bored and their efforts to give some depth to their characters fails miserably. William H. Macy did never act that bad since Air Force One and Ta Leoni.. well, she actualy only screams and plays the helpless woman.
THE SCRIPT/DIRECTION: THhe story isn't really existing but after The lost World, I wasn't really expecting a lot. While the first Jurassic Park had an interesting story to tell, the sequels just consit of humans running away from dinosaurs. But they are great. In Jurassic Park II the star is the Spinosaur and in its most exciting scene, he kills of the king... the T-Rex. The blending between live action dinosaurs and CG-creatures is seemless and amazing. The most suspensful scene involves Pteradons, flying dinosaurs. It is the only sequwence that builds up tension. The rest of the movie is to rushed to accomplish that and Joe Johnston tends to cut away from beautiful shots too fast so you can't quite marvel at the images.
ALL IN ALL Jurassic Park III is entertainig but hollow, it is fun but over before it starts. It's the typical sequel cash-in movie, that is unnecessary but not useless.",1009411200,,1678,4.691525423728813
1297034,4,B00003CXXR,"Of all three JP movies, I think JP3 just might be the one I'll be watching most often. The first movie was really good, but after countless times watching it I've found myself tiring of the first half, waiting impatiently for the dinosaurs to break loose. The Lost World was also good, yet slightly flawed somehow. This third installment gives the viewer the most bang for their buck. Not only does it feature the best dinosaur effects as of yet, the action pieces are also inventive and memorable. You've got the infamous T-Rex vs. Spinosaurus smackdown, Billy's parasail rescue in the aviary, and the confrontation with the Spinosaurus yet again in the river. True, the script is lacking in some areas (Amanda Kirby doesn't react to the death of her b/f when they find his corpse) and cliched in other parts (Billy, the over-eager assistant), but the actors and actresses bring their characters to life, and make the movie compelling.
Universal has done a great job with this DVD. The audio is fantastic. I've heard the picture suffers from edge enhancement or whatever, but since I don't have a widescreen TV, the picture looks great to me. The supplements are what make the disc, though. While a lot of the supplements look superficial and promotional, they offer a lot more depth than one might expect. Don't expect an hour-long documentary ala Star Wars Episode One, but the half-hour behind-the-scenes program is better than the usual ten-minute peek Universal's past DVD's have offered. What really makes these supplements worthwhile is that they enhanced my perception of the flick. From the commentary track to the mini featurettes, you really get the feeling that all who were involved had a fantastic time making Jurassic Park III. That's rare, especially when making a sequel that the public really didn't expect much from. JPIII did not come from a third-rate, inexperienced director or a bunch of actors lured back to the franchise with $$$. Watch the movie, then go through all the special features, and you'll see JPIII in a whole new light.
This is a really great disc for a great movie which proves the JP franchise hasn't quite gone extinct yet. Buy it now!",1009238400,3,2177,4.870619946091645

Everyone must listen to their own instincts and judge these movies themselves -- what is great for one is not for another!
I hardly ever agreed with Siskel and Ebert.

1297039,1,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park 3 is one of the worst films of the year, it is below mediocre and contains a laughable plot delivered by a bunch of mediocre actors. This movie is so pathetic it doesn't even deserve your consideration, it is a piece of manufactured cinema with no heart or soul. The action scenes are pointless and unsuspenseful, the acting is horrible, the plot is unconvincing, and the musical score is laughable. I can give you a hundred reasons as to why I think this movie is bad. I realised this film was going to be horrible the second the opening titles popped on the screen with the Jurassic Park 3 logo and the extremely lame and clichd claw marks that make you 'jump out of your seat' to go to the nearest restroom and vomit. The opening prologue is even more laughable, with its horrible blue screen utilisation and bad movie score. The next fifteen minutes get even worse: Laura Dern's fakely delivers dialogue and Sam Neil begins conjuring up other pointless theories about raptor intelligence. Wasn't it obvious in the first Jurassic Park film that the raptors were intelligent? I somehow always knew that the raptors could communicate and to explore that entire concept on one movie is redundant.
Next, the island we visited in The Lost World has somewhat gone through some magical ecological changes since 1997. Instead of being a jungle/forest environment it's now a swampy/jungle landscape. Not only has the environment changed but the inhabitents have also gone through some changes as well. It's like the animals are evolving in a matter of years; the velociraptors have changed colours: Palaeontologist Jack Horner suggested adding new feathers atop the male animals based on evidence that suggested the velociraptors carried feathers; the Tyrannosaur also has a new personality in Jurassic Park 3: instead of being a ferocious predator, she's a scavanger who quickly gets beaten by the spinosaurus. Whose fault is it that the animals have magically morphed? None other than Palaeontogist Jack Horner who decided to screw continuity in order to give a more accurate depiction of the animals based on his theories and beliefs. Screw accuracy, I want sequels to have continuity.
The musical score is boring and repititious and unlike its last two predecessors: Don Davis' score places the Jurassic Park theme in unnecessary moments and gives no life to the movie whatsoever. Davis adds nothing to the Jurassic Park franchise and neither does the movie's director Joe Johnston. I hope that someday someone with intelligence is handed the throne of directing a Jurassic Park movie, someone who can save a dying franchise recognised by brainless summer moviegoers and five/fifteen year old boys, someone who can return dignity to the already dead franchise. Erase this hollywood mistake by making a Jurassic Park 4 with an actual subtitle, that completely dismisses the retarded brother Jurassic Park 3 is to the original Jurassic Park and the highly underrated The Lost World: Jurassic Park.",1008892800,2,3007,5.0523138832997985

1297072,3,B00003CXXR,"with all the hype JPIII got when it was coming out in the theatres, I was expecting a very good movie, possibly even better than the first.  I was very dissapointed when I saw this movie last night.
The plot was probally the worst part of this movie, obviously rushed and thrown together.  First of all, Dr. Grant is convinced way to easy to go BACK to the island as if he never learned about what happened in the first two movies.  Secondly, this movie totally leaves you hanging about the outcome of JPII. Dr. Grant mentions it ONE time in the entire movie, and even when he mentions it, he asks people not to ask him about it (what a way by the writers to get out of actually doing work to try to fit the ending of JP2 into JP3, laziness).  JP3 could have very easily been a movie on its own rather than a sequal because it does not seem to fit into the previous installments.  It kind of fits into the plot of the JP1 but definetely not JP2.  Finally, one very interesting thing about the plot, is that there were only three kills in the entire movie.  The first two kills happened in the beginning and the last one happened in the middle and thats it the rest of the movie involved the characters running from the same big dinosaur and of course, raptors.  In addition to this the little boy that was trapped on the island was there for 8 WEEKS before the other people arrived.  How could you survive even more than a week on an island full of flesh-eating carnivores?  Impossible in my opinion.  In addtion to this, how in the world did they get off the island losing only three people when most of the time they were just sitting around outside talking.  One more thing about the plot, it seems that the writers made up stuff as they went along instead of actually THINKING about what they wanted to do in the movie before they wrote it.  Many times throughout the movie, new situations would be introduced that would have had no relevance to the story line if they had been left out.  But the fact that they introduced them forced the writers to keep talking about it, which made the plot even worse.
Now the action sequences.  Other than the first scene on the island, there was no creativity in this movie as far as this goes.  As one reviewer said, just alot of screams, roars and running.  The visual effects themselves were good, as they have always been, but just no creativity in the actual scences.  I won't spend much time on the action portion, because there is not really much to talk about.  If you saw the first two movies, then you basically won't see anything new in this one.
JP3 was rushed and no thought was put into making a very good movie.  I kept waiting for something ""good"" to happen that would make the movie more interesting and enjoyable.  I keep waiting, and waiting and then before I knew it, the movie was over.
If it wasn't a couple of scences and definetely the last scences of JP2, I would say that JP3 is the worse movie in this series.  However with JP2 being totally stupid and corny, I do not dare say JP3 is worse than JP2, but it is pretty close.
Unless you want to collect the entire JP series, just rent this movie.",1008806400,3,3164,4.3181049069373945

When I saw all the extras included on this DVD I literally began to froth at the mouth like a Spinosaurus bringing down a T. Rex.  As I went through the Bonus materials menu, however, I grew more and more dissappointed.  The features are fascinating, but they are short--way too short.  Most of them are only a few minutes long.  The bonus feature on ILM, however, takes the cake.  You have to navigate through some 10- 20 menus (I couldn't bear to count them), with four top-level menus, some of those then opening up into more menus three deep!  In other words, you'll be ready for a thumb transplant by the time you finish watching all the little features.  Now get this--some of all that navigation will get you THREE SECONDS of video.

1297114,2,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park III"" proves definitively that the bloom is off the rose when it comes to this particular movie series.  In the third installment of the dinosaur epic, virtually every plot element - nay, every shot - seems like a tired rehash of the ones found in the two previous works.  The only difference here is that the dinosaurs manage to serve as unwitting family therapists for a tiresome divorced couple and their precocious young son.
Sam Neill, the star of the original film, returns in the role of nerdy paleontologist, Dr. Alan Grant - and his presence merely reminds us of the power that was generated by this material before it lost its originality and luster.  With nowhere left to go with the concept, this third version is reduced to little more than a monotonous series of chases through thick jungle growth, with the actors running around like mad in the foreground while some impressive looking dinosaurs wreak havoc in the background.  It seems inconceivable to imagine that it actually took THREE paid writers to come up with a script as lacking in originality and interest as the one we have here.  The anticlimactic ending is particularly ludicrous and incredible (not to mention faintly distasteful since the final shot turns out to be a close up looking straight into a pterodactyl's rear end).  Unlike the previous two films,  ""Jurassic Park III"" fails to generate even a modicum of chills and thrills.  There is, literally, not a single scary or suspenseful moment in the entire film.  Where is Steven Spielberg when you need him?  (Joe Johnston took over the directorial chores for this outing).  At least Spielberg knows how to get the adrenalin pumping - even with hokey material such as this.
The real problem with this film lies in the nature of the series itself.  Unlike the ""Star Wars"" films, which provide us with an ever-evolving story line and set of characters that help to make each new installment an integral part of a varied whole, the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise is pretty much limited to finding new excuses to get people in front of those rampaging dinosaurs.  The writers of this latest version, desperate to bring even a trace of originality to the concept, play with the childish notion that the veloceraptors are actually able to communicate with each other.  In other words, we have left the world of ""reality,"" where dinosaurs are allowed to be dinosaurs, and have turned these magnificent creatures into reptilian versions of ourselves.  What could be more arrogant?

Anyone who is Jurassic Park fan should own this DVD.",1008374400,,665,4.045454545454546
1297116,5,B00003CXXR,"When I first watched Jurassic Park 3, I didn't think it was any good. In fact, I was amused that so much money could be poured into a movie and yet It still stunk. My whole opinion has since changed once I learned of something very few people are aware of.
JP 3 was written, directed, co-stared and storyboarded,  entirely by raptors. Its true, they do have a superior intellect (well almost)! There are a few rumors floating about in the Hollywood circuit that they had some help by primates, some have even gone so far as to say the star of ""Dunstin Checks In"" ghostwrote the screenplay. I can't speculate on that, but all I know is that they work for stagehands and the occasional backrub (Hollywood better take advantage of them now before they go and form unions). Although raptors have yet to master the fine art of 3D animation, they sure as hell are giving Hollywood directors a run for their money. Bravo!",1008288000,3,914,4.506024096385542

So i ask nobody to ever buy this film.",1008288000,2,312,4.048387096774194
1297119,5,B00003CXXR,"JP 3 is a well-executed sequel. The movie is extremely fast and packed with action. Time is not wasted with unnecessary character development, yet each character is introduced, and you get a sense of what this person is all about. The story is simple and very easily understood. Even though Dr. Allan Grant is back, the story actually has very little to do with what happened in the first two films. This combined with all the new dinosaurs, gives the movie an original twist. The velociraptors this time around are unbelievable, and that Spinosaur is simply terrifying(T-Rex gets his head literally ripped off). JP 3 clearly surpasses ""The Lost World"". It's a Summer movie packed with nail-biting action and fun. I just wish it could have been a bit longer. The DVD is definitely worth the buy. There are some great extras to be seen here.",1008288000,,840,4.760273972602739
1297120,4,B00003CXXR,"To be honest, the third installment may be the best of the series.  The first film was good but succeeded primarily on oohs and ahhs and a few well placed tense scenes.  The problem with the first film was that it ran a bit long.  The second film's major problem was that the ending was forced and way out there.  This film succeeds because it makes no secret about what it is.  There is no deep plot here, although the major plot elements do work together (yes, even the ending works in the plot - remember that Laura Dern's <Dr. Sattler> husband said he worked for the state department).  It does stretch reality a bit, but it is a film about dinosaurs and action films tend to rarely resemble reality.  What this film is is fun.  There is hardly a dull moment.  I've seen the movie a couple times and still jump out of my seat, even though I expect the shock (might have something to do with the timing).  If you want a deep film with a complicated plot and intricate storyline then it would be best to stay away.  If you want an action film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and take you away from the world for a bit then, well, this one might be for you.  Not really a 4 star film; I rounded up.  3.5 stars.",1008201600,,1223,4.13135593220339

1297182,5,B00003CXXR,"For those seaking huge long dramatic movies with complex, Oscar-winning scripts and plots...you're looking at the wrong movie! Jurassic Park III is awesome! I don't know what the hell is wrong with you people who are giving this bad reviews! JP3 has got some awesome action, and this is a great DVD to add to your collection. For those who loved the first, you will like this one. For those who loved the second, you may be disappointed. But for those who loved the first AND second...you'll be in heaven with this one!
JP3 stars Sam Neill as his recurring role of Dr Alan Grant who claims that no heaven on earth could get him to go back on the island of Jurassic Park. When a rich couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni), pay Grant a large sum of money to take them across the island of Isla Sorna (site *B* where the Lost World took place) for their honeymoon, Grant reluclantly agrees as long as they don't land on the island and just fly across it on the plane. Grant brings his new paleontologist partner, Billy (Alassandro Nirvonna) along for the ride. But as they fly across the island, Grant notices that the Kirbys have worried expressions on their faces and keep staring out the windows, as if they were searching for something. Finally, a huge dinosaur pops out of nowhere onto the scene and completely destroys their plane...the two pilots get eaten and the foursome just barely manage to escape. Now, Grant, Billy, and the Kirbys are stranded on the island. They soon confess to Grant and Billy that they are divorced and that the real reason why they wanted to come here in the first place was to look for their missing son, Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), who got stranded on the island a few weeks ago while para sailing with Amanda's new boyfriend. Grant and Billy agree to go searching for Eric, but warn the Kirbys that Eric is probably dead. But finding Eric is just the beginning and not their biggest problem. Their biggest problem is getting off the island...alive.
Though the plot may seem cheesy and lame, the movie itself is not. I saw this movie on opening night in the theaters and absolutely loved it! The acting is great, the special effects are absolutely stunning. Why shouldn't the producers show off what they can do with special effects? The dinosaurs look so real. This is an awesome DVD, too with great special features such as the making of JP3, cast & crew interviews, the setting of JP3, and more! I can't wait to buy this DVD. You shouldn't pass this movie up if you love action flicks. You'll totally regret it if you do!",1008201600,,2580,4.53862660944206
1297183,3,B00003CXXR,"Well, JP3 is a decent flick. First time I saw it I was completely blown away. The second time however it wasn't that great. Still the action sequences are amazing. ILM really outdid themselves on the dino effects. But the comic relief starts to wear thin already the second time round, and well, the story isn't that great. It works though, just don't pay too much time to details. Sam Neill is good, as is Bill Macy (as always, one of my favorite actors). So, the best thing to do is rent this, and decide for yourself whether to buy this or not. I don't know about the DVD extras, guess you'll need to find that out for yourself.
All in all JP3 is a fun movie, but don't expect mindboggling plots or something.",1008201600,,712,4.32089552238806

When the plane crashes, Dr. Grant & the Passengers have no choice but to face the creatures on the island, which are far more dangerous and vicious than they could ever imagine.
This is almost better than the Orignal but is much more better than the Flawed sequel-The Lost World:Jurassic Park. Steven Spielberg is surely miss as the director chair of the first two films but Filmmaker Joe Johnson (Jumanji, The Rocketeer) did an fine job directing the last in the series. The two flaws is too short and a bit too much humor but the film Visual Effects & Action-Adventure is non-stop. DVD has an great anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an cool sounding Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). The DVD is Packed with Extras.

1297185,2,B00003CXXR,"This joins the long list of sequels that don't only not measure up to the original but don't measure up full stop.  It even manages to be worst than 'The Lost World', which a feat in itself.  I'm unsure whether the corny story was intentional.  If it is then it's a terrible idea.  There's absolutely no suspense, mumbled pseudo-science pushed onto us - more about intelligent raptors - and from the start you can tell exactly which characters will survive.  All this and a stunningly abrupt ending that even makes we wish for the T-rex rampaging San Deigo.
There are two good things going for this movie: the acting and the special effects.  With regards to the dinosaurs, impressive as they are we have seen them before.  They were ground-breaking in 'Jurassic Park' but here the director seems to have relied to heavily on imposing images which aren't quite as imposing as I imagine he hoped.  The acting meanwhile is another matter.  There's William H Macy (of 'Magnolia' and 'ER'), Tea Leoni ('Deep Impact', though probably more famous as David Duchovany's wife) and the team have wisely brought back Sam Neill.  The real star though is Laura Dern, who returns for a few scenes near the start and the end.  Unfortunately her scenes appear so brief it makes you wonder why she returned at all.
This is a film that will entertain kids, but certainly not adults.",1008201600,,1364,4.713080168776371
1297186,4,B00003CXXR,Well my title says it all this movie contains lots of Lies.  For one the directors chose to put the t-rex in the first film (the t-rex was the largest and strongest carnivorr of all time) then they completly cut it from the 3 movie but with one exepction were the t-rex and the spionsaurs fight.  The t-rex was made alot smaller in that scene and it would have won in real life.  The fact that they took a dino  that was much smaller than the t-rex and almost doubled it's size is not that smart because the spinosaures only ate fish makeing it's body not muscluar at all.  If they were smart they would have started with the spinosuras and then the t-rex in the 3 movie.  However dispite that very very dumb scene this move was still pretty good.  Being a dino expert I loved these movies.  One this however they could have added to teh movie this is one of the shortest movies I have ever seen.  They oucld have sdded the best dino that got cut form this movie.  the diloposarus (bad spelling) but they were orinanally going to have it appere in this movie but cut it.  that had to be on eof the besst dino's that they cut along with that they added a red dino that the cast could have meet up with again.  However the ending kinda told you that they are going to make another jurassic park.  Aperently with a bigger dino that the t-rex and the oversized spinosaurs.  but overall this movie would have been alot beeter with out the t-rex and spion fighting and wth more of the t-rex in it ( I am sounding like a broken record) but there is somthing more scary about haveing this huge dino look at you and you are not suposed to move.  C'mon the t-rex was much scaryer  admit.  But at least the special effects were awsome!,1008201600,,1724,4.2392638036809815
1297187,4,B00003CXXR,"Let me start off by saying that I am a major fan of the original Jurassic Park. I thought the story was original, the plot was exciting, and the acting was excellent. Then The Lost World: Jurassic Park II came out. I was disappointed to say the least. It was a bastardization of the entire series. With this said, I did not have high expectations when going to see Jurassic Park III.
However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It is by no means as good as the first film, but it still provides a enjoyable movie experience. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern returns with a small role as Dr. Laura Satler. William H. Macy and Ta Leoni play somewhat annoying roles as a couple that hires Dr. Grant to take them on an tour of Isla Sorna (the island from the second film) via air plane. Of course they all end up on the island, and have to find an escape before they become dinosaur food.
Yes, the plot might not be original, but do not let that deter you from seeing the movie. The movie itself is considerably shorter than the previous films. An hour-thirty minutes compared to the other films running times of just over two hours each. This provides just enough time to really enjoy the movie before you might start to get bored with it (much like JP2).
The acting was excellent overall, especially by Sam Neill. The story was good. They kept the characters on the island for this film (No stupid dinosaurs in the middle of San Francisco this time). Basically the only problem I had with the film was that they made the kid smarter than the adults, much like in the first two films, but not to the extent that it was in the Lost World. Too much of the ""kid saves the day"" syndrome is going through the heads of Hollywood screenwriters these days.
Anyway, the flaws in this film really are minor, and I would recommend this film to any Jurassic Park fan. I enjoyed this film and look forward to watching it again. This is the movie The Lost World should have been. If you are new to Jurassic Park, definately start with the first (which is still the best). Otherwise rent or buy this movie to add to your collection.",1008115200,7,2158,4.344059405940594

The actors horrendous; the dialogue absolutely laughable (and you will, although it's not intended to be funny when you laugh); the story prety much non-existant; the dinos looked worse to me; and a whole series of situations that if happened in the first 2, would've cashed out the people trapped on the island, but magically here they get by.
Oh well. Movie is not too good. The DVD on the other hand has some great stuff you will like. A lot of ""making of"", behind the scenes stuff, film commentary, tons of stuff. A lot of work went into the dvd itself (video, audio, extras) and will impress you if you choose to get it. The DVD as a whole gets a 4 stars, the movie a 2.

Even Sam Neill is bad in this film, and that is embarrassing because he is great in anything.  I know Some people are saying that if you don't compare it to the First Two films, then you will enjoy it, but that is a bunch of [nonsense]. The first two movie( Jurassic Park And The Lost World) were great because they were about something. They had compelling stories to them, And characters you can care about.

So, they end up crashing on the island and the fun begins. I thought JURASSIC PARK 3 was the weakest in the series but it was still fun. It seemed really short too.

The only real problem I have with the Jurassic Park Trilogy is that it really strayed away from the book. When you read ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" you are more scared than ever. There was so much more in the books I can't imagine why they skimped in the films. I found it odd that elements in the first book were put into the second movie and the third movie. I loved the ending in ""JP"" the book. I'd wished they did that in the film. I always kind of wondered where those
raptors were heading off to. Also, there were 2 children in the ""Lost World"" book and they went through hell with those raptors. The whole flying dinosaurs scene is actually in the first book.

Sure the 1st JP is a pure classic and The Lost World tries to recapture the awe of the orginal and The Lost World *tries* to do the same thing but doesn't pull it off very well.  Jurassic Park 3 tells you right from the start with a claw ripping through the JP logo that this time the dinosaurs aren't playing around.  Sam Neil returns and gives a excellent performance as usual. The supporting cast does well also with William H. Macy and Tea Lenio giving strong performances.  The real winners here though are the dinosaurs. As soon as humans once again arrive and disrupt their natural habitat they are just fed up it seems and don't play any games.  In the first two films the dinosaurs seem a bit hesitant to eat some good ol' human flesh but, not in this film though. The new bad boy Spinosaurus quickly claims himself as the king of the jungle by taking out one of the legendary actors of the series.

This movie is a perfect example of a movie series gone bad. The first movie is good, and maybe the second, but when a sequel comes out, it is terrible, and ruins the entire series.
In this movie, a couple lies to the scientists and says that they have permision to go to a jurasic park island. They land on it, crash land rather, and then find themselves stranded on the island. The couple reveals the lie, that they had a son parachouting and crash landed on the island, so they wanted to look for him. Struglling for survival, they run into many different dinosaurs, and finaly, after many days, the army finds them.
As you can see, this movie is pretty cheesy. The story is pretty bad. What moron would allow their son to parachute from an airplane onto an island! You have to give them some credit though, because their special effects were incredible, and those of you with home theatre systems (like me) will enjoy the encredible sound.

1297252,1,B00003CXXR,"I loved the original Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park II was not quite the blockbuster as the original, but it was still good.  Jurassic Park III is an embarrassment.  I can't believe that Steven Spielberg, whom I consider to be one of the most innovative and talented producers/directors around, would put out this movie.  And, I have heard that Michael Crichton retains some control over all projects that he is associated with.  I have read Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain and most of Crichton's novels and have always been entertained/impressed with his killer, innovative plots and fast-paced stories.  Did he actually approve this sequel?  Neither Spielberg nor Crichton could conceivably need money so badly to associate themselves with this movie...  It did make a good trailer, and probably could be cut to a good short, but does not make it as a full length film.
All of the Jurassic Park plots were simplistic but involved the viewer with their great character development -- and the special effects.  Those characters were 3 dimensional, you empathized with them, you felt their frustrations, their fears.  But Jurassic Park III had ""cardboard"", 2 dimensional characters.  You could not identify with them. (In fact, remember the character that played the mother searching for her son?  She was so uninspired and annoying that I was hoping that a TRex or velicoraptor would take her out early in the film so I wouldn't have to hear her whine any more.)  So, without any real character development and with a simplistic plot, all you are left with are the special effects.  And, while these are good, we have seen them in the other Jurassic Park movies... George Lucas' Star Wars movies, the Star Trek movie series, the James Bond movies -- all remain viable because all sequels managed to retain those features, those strengths, that made them popular in the first place.  Jurassic Park III does not do this.  Am I being overly critical?  I think not.  The proof will be that there will never be a Jurassic Park IV.",1007164800,,2024,4.902941176470589
1297253,3,B00003CXXR,"Usually film series degrade as they progress through sequel after sequel, but I would say that the Jurassic Park films are the exception. Perhaps my thinking is skewed because I went to the original Jurassic Park with such high expectations, and was let down, but went to JP III expecting a stinker, and well, it was a watchable film.
Most of the credit for the film's watchability goes to Trevor Morgan, a rare child actor who neither mugs for the camera nor delivers cute one-liners written by a screenwriter who has no idea how adolescents talk. Frankly, I was a little bored until he appeared, then the film picked up; he injected some life into it, even managing to act and react among adults who were giving less than sterling performances.
William H. Macy plays boring middle aged monotone guy that made him famous-- not to be confused with his occasion turns as shouting angry middle aged guy. This is all he's expected to do, and he delivers.
Tea Leoni is completely wasted. She is a fine comic actress, and G-d knows this film could have used a little comic relief, but as there is none in the script, she has little to do besides be shrill and whiny. Poor Leoni seems to realize how ridiculous her character is, and just can't help occasionally stepping outside her, just to let us know she knows. A fatal mistake, but I suppose better than letting people think you think you're delivering serious Oscar material.
Sam Neill squints at things, and makes lots of scientific pronouncements, and is believable if not compelling. For me, he will never do anything better than My Brilliant Career, though, so it's useless for me to comment on his performance.
The CGI is as good as ever, I suppose, although I never did get a good perspective on the sail-back dinosaur. I couldn't figure out how big it was supposed to be. At first it seemed at big as the T-rex, in their confrontation scene, then later, there's this jaw shot, where it seems to have a very long neck, but not such a big body; at the end it is huge, a real monster. But all the eyes were good; the dinosaurs had penetrating gazes that were quite frightening. To be able to achieve that effect of real eye contact is quite an attainment.
I don't really know how many people see these movies for the plot, per se. Isn't the plot really an excuse to show off the special effects? In this film, the writers have abandoned all pretense of science (all that ridiculous DNA frog fiction in the original film, e.g.), and made a fantasy. I enjoyed that much more.
I hope Trevor Morgan gets some kind of special Oscar.",1007078400,8,2580,4.550537634408602
1297254,2,B00003CXXR,"At least they have Sam Neill in this one!
The only wonderful scene was when the flying pteraodon turned his head in full close-up at the humans.  The special effects in that scene were amazing, looking so real.
Actually the flying pteraodons were the stars in this movie.  However this movie left me wanting more.  The plot was really no plot, the movie was short, basically it was throw some dinosaurs in, some screaming, a hero, [and a love story] and again Hollywood ruins it again.

THAT is on my Christmas list.
  To have Sam neil back in it was great.  And they did a good job with all the other actors they picked...they did a good job together.  You got to see alot more of different dinosaurs, which was great.  I love the petradon house...(enormous bird cage).  that whole scene was great.  this movie made me jump once...I laughed....and watched twice in a row.  The whole Jurassic park thing is great.

1297312,4,B00003CXXR,"First off, I'll say that I spent about a year at Dan's JP3 Page, anxiously anticipating this film.  I have always been a huge JP fan and believe it or not, I loved The Lost World.  After the long period of waiting and speculating, July 18th came and I rushed to theaters.  I sat in my seat, giddy as a schoolboy about the new addition to one of my two favorite series (along with Star Wars.)  Was the waiting worth it?  Was the movie even that good?  Could Joe Johnston make a movie worthy of the name ""Jurassic Park""?
After seeing JP3 for the first time, I said to myself ""eh...it was pretty good.""  I thought it wasn't as good as the other two JPs, thought the plot was stupid, and missed the T-Rex.
I saw it again later.  I LOVED IT AFTER THAT.  When first watching this film, it is normal to expect something in perticular.  What many fail to recognize is this:
JP3 was a fantastic movie for being a sequel.
Sure, it doesn't match to awe and wonder of Steven Speilbergs original masterpeice, but it was a great sequel.  Everything in it was fresh: The new intelligent raptors, brand new characters, the Spinosaur, the pteranodons, the para-sailing.  EVERYTHING WAS FRESH.  I never expected it to lose all the things we had gotten so used to in the first 2 to be gone.  Plus, it had a different mood, which I didn't expect.
JP3 was an excellent sequel.  So many sequels are crap these days and JP3 was far better than that.  Keep that in mind while your watching it on DVD instead of thinking about how it compares to the original.  :D",1006387200,,1538,4.340350877192982
1297313,4,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park III really did a number on the summer box office. It grossed $100,485,000 in the box office. I think that people expected too much drama in this film, but it was ALL action. They have had been too much talk about the film lacking a storyline! WHAT?!? If you're too dumb too see the storyline then you don't know too much.
The film is about a supposedly rich couple (William H Macy and Ta Leoni), whose son gets lost in the Jurassic Park. Now they must retrieve him by taking dinosaur expert Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and his protg (Allesandro Nivola), to take them on a tour of the park. Little does the Doctor know that their planning on landing in Jurassic Park! From then on all new dinosaurs appear, and the chaos begins.
This film was far-too short, but it is a great movie. (The movie only lasted 1 Hour: 23 Minutes). But it has superb acting, and great script, not to mention a ton of action. If there's one action DVD you can't resist, its this!

The action sequences are outstanding, particularly the part in the pterodactyl cage.  This is a very intense, very adrenalizing movie that anyone who enjoys a good thrill ride will love.

I mean the frist parts of the movie are really good but once it gets to the part were the kid saves dr. grant it all goes down hill from there. I makes me sick, this movie is a joke JP III is an insult to this series.  The first one was really good the second had its moments but the third is geared toward little kids. I mean its like they wanted to make even more money with the toys with this movie then all the others i mean they had toys that were not even in the movie.

1297317,1,B00003CXXR,"In my eyes, the Jurassic Park series has gone downhill each sequel. This sequel has nothing more than great dinosaur effects. Storywise, I'm sure kids will love it. What is with the obsession with the velociraptors? There are so many other interesting dinosaurs to bring to life, why focus on these in particular for 3 films? And this spinosaurus, don't make me laugh. It can bring down airplanes and kill a T-rex, but thats about it. I guess if all dinosaurs were human size the spinosaurus would be the first extinct dinosaur. And where was this superior dinosaur up until now? Sleeping? Who knows. Maybe it should take some advice from the velociraptors,since they can basically do everything except drive a car(part 4?). If theres to be a JP4, I hope they leave out the spinosaurus, drop some of the velociraptor coverage and invest some time in the multitudes of dinosaurs on whatever island they go to next time.",1005436800,,918,4.779874213836478

I feel really bad for Sam Neill there is no way this movie could have looked good on paper, they must have driven a dump truck full of money up to his house for him to say yes to this movie.  I loved Jurassic Park.  It should have stopped there.  I bought Lost Word because it came with the Jurassic Park DVD.

If you like scary dino movies than stick with THE LOST WORLD, but JP III is a good old fashioned B movie at its best with likeable characters, amazing effects, and roller-coaster ride sequences.  Not as amazing as it was back in 1994 with the first JP, but this new movie proves that if you work hard and put your heart and soul in it, even a Part 3 can be fun.",1005091200,,441,4.057471264367816
1297360,2,B00003CXXR,"Perhaps I've taken it for granted that the viewing public considered this to be the weakest film in the series, because it is.  JP3 is a film that had to be made to round out the trilogy, but they went about it wrong in almost every area.
For one thing--and perhaps the biggest gripe of all--is that JP3 does NOT try to one-up the past two films with a new idea.  In the original, the simple concept of believable dinosaurs sufficed and a classic was created.  In the Lost World, a film of lesser quality than its predecessor, it maintained a revolutionary advantage by introducing dinosaurs into human culture, here signified by San Diego.  In JP3, everyone is back on the island and the film seems like only a poor remake of the original; there is nothing new here, and everything that has been carried over was enacted to a far greater degree in the first film.
The film suffers in this respect, but further complaints are pending.  For one thing, dialogue is often laughable and character motivations seem to be negated completely.  Moreover, the ending is so incredibly anticlimatic that is undeniably apparent that the script was NOT completely finished at the time of production.
But all this is not to condemn the film in its entirety.  The dinosaurs look great as usual and even though I can't enjoy the film's story as I did the original, I will no doubt return to this chapter to enjoy the continuing spectacle of computer animation.  Also, though the pacing--especially in the beginning--can seem awfully rushed, there is a steady stream of action that doesn't cease and yet still doesn't tire the audience.  Perhaps to the benefit of the audience, the short running time doesn't overstay the welcome of such a flawed film.
So, what I get from this film is this:  It's great to see Dr. Grant in the park again; it's great to see those believable dinosaurs; it's a good adventure.  However: there is nothing new given to the viewer; a far from satisfactory story negates anything resembling plot; and it has characters that go no where and who, frankly, you don't really ever care to meet again.  In short, see it to relive your past enthusiasm for the series, see it for the effects, don't see it to find a satisfying and respectable addition to the genre.",1004832000,7,2268,4.6708542713567835

1297362,1,B00003CXXR,"When Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park', which I have not seen, opened in 1993 it was one of those films that was an instant blockbuster. Like 'Rush Hour 2' and 'Shrek'. Four years later Steven got up the courage to direct 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', otherwise known simply as 'Jurassic Park 2'. What I meant by when I said ""got up the courage"" I meant he was taking a chance with the critics, if they were going to like it or if they were going to hate it. They hated it and so did I. 'Jurassic Park 2' is like Best Picture up against 'Jurassic Park 3', the worst film of the summer and probably the worst film of the year, but I haven't seen 'Planet of the Apes' yet. The acting was beyond the grave of sadness, the film's setting was next to nonexistent, and to top it off, what mother in their right mind would let their son go parachutting on a forbidden island?

1297363,3,B00003CXXR,"Well, its the 3rd installation of the Jurassic Park series.  It definitely ain't great.  But its not bad, either.
This film is obviously not meant to be plot driven, but that's ok.  Chances are you won't like this movie when you first see it, but it will grow on you once you watch it a second time.  The special effects are pretty good, if a little dated, and the action is intense and non-stop.  Sam Neil reprising the role as Grant is a definite plus.  Not a great movie, but a fun movie.
The DVD edition is actually rather great.  There are tons of features that make it well worth your money.  The collectible booklet is actually a huge pull out of dinosaur size comparisons and movie facts.  The Special Features menu is huge, with 'Behind the Scenes' documentaries, theatrical trailers, Cast and Crew Information, and a bunch of other extra goodies.  While the movie isn't anything spectacular, if you liked the first two, you'll probably still like this film despite the inconsistencies and plot holes.  The plethora of extras make up for this, and overall its a pretty good DVD to add to your collection.",1003708800,,1113,4.627551020408164
1297364,4,B00003CXXR,"JP3 is nothing more than an action filled, edge of your seat, nail biting, heart pounding, jump out of your seat action thriller with `oh my god, do those Dinos look real' special effects.  With that said, why wouldn't anyone want to see this movie?  I can't think of one reason.  This movie was great.  It was such an improvement over the second one that I am now hoping they make a fourth one, and let Joe Johnston direct it, PLEASE!  I know that Spielberg was happy with what he saw. Which tells me one thing, Spielberg has outgrown these movies.  He's moved on to bigger things, like A.I. and Saving Private Ryan.  So let the reigns of his more meager works be taken over by lesser known talented directors.  Johnston does a superb job of handling the legacy of Jurassic Park.  He takes it back to the roots.  The movie is more of an action adventure.  It does tend to touch more on the themes of messing with nature and whether it is right or wrong as they did in the first one, but not as much.  Alan Grant, played very well again by Sam Neil, is hired to play aerial tour guide for a rich couple who want to see Isla Sorna from a plane.  A crash ensues and of course, people become snacks for the Dinos.  There are some cheesier themes of family togetherness as Grant finds out that his rich thrill seekers are really poor saps looking for their lost son on the island.  But the action that ensues from this is entertaining and pulse pounding.  There are many more types of dinosaurs to be seen, and the new big baddie, the Spinasauras is absolutely nasty.  the fight between him and the T-Rex is worth the cost of admission alone.  Improvements in Computer animation since the first movie allow us to see spectacular aerial shots of so many Dinos that you want to believe there is an Island out there with these creatures to be seen.  As I said beore, don't look for heavy themes of whether we should be tampering with nature as they did in the first movie, but you can count on something much more thrilling and fun to watch then the second movie.  Highly recommended.",1003622400,3,2077,4.3733681462141

1297366,4,B00003CXXR,"There was only one thing I liked about JP2 (when the trailer is upside down and the woman is laying on cracked glass--that whole scene was terrific) and there were MORE things I liked about JP3.
What a come back! But...it was SO SHORT! It had nearly everything I wanted to see in it but just seemed that there was little room for character development to introduce the new people. Tia Leone's character....was a tad depressing.
When I knew she was going to be in it I thought that I was going to be impressed...instead I was just, amused and or left disgusted; sitting there just shaking my head at her stupid antics. They could have casted her with a better part to play as ""Mom"". She was kind of a twit as she was.
But I really enjoyed the movie otherwise. While JP2 is going to collect dust on someone elses' video cabinet, I'll let JP3 collect a little dust in mine and be more satisfied.",1003363200,,892,4.347305389221557
1297367,3,B00003CXXR,"Was there some need for a third one?  Did they need to have a trilogy or something?  Some major complaints I have about this movie are that its not directed by Steven Speilberg, there are only a few returning characters, and even then they aren't all that interesting, its not based on a Crichton novel, the story doesnt even compare to the other Jurrasic Park films, and its way way WAY too short.
  The CG of this movie was excellent, of course but I think it was actually too elaborate.  I like the style of the old JP movies CG.  It seems that CG now a days is reaching the point were its extremely obvious.  Some parts like in the pteranodon's cage had very nice looking CG.
  The story was not that great.  It was like they needed to find some way to get Dr. Grant back on the island so they could have some sort of a sequel and this is the only way they could do it.  I'm not going to explain the story since it most likely will contain spoilers.  I also beleive that most people entered the movie theaters beleiving that they would be seeing entirely new dinosaurs that have never ever been seen before, like dinosaurs that were genetically mutated fictional dinosaurs.  Wrong.  The ""Super mega smart raptors that can talk to each other"" are just regular raptors, its just that they (Dr. Grant, etc.) are now realizing that they have the ability to communicate.  The feathers on their head?  basically just difference between either 'social groups' (sorry couldn't think of any other phrase)  or sex, I'm not quite sure/remebering.  The Spinosaurus (the one that is shown swimming in the water with the big sail) is of course a real dinosaur, but since they didn't show to many clips of it in the trailer, I have reason to beleive people thought it was some new aquatic dino.
Anyway, the movie is just way way to short at around an hour and a half.  It will leave people dissapointed.  About the characters, only Sam Neils character (Dr. Grant) and his 'girlfriend' (thats what you think) reappear in the movie. No Ian Malcom, no John Hammond.  Thats a major dissapointment. Of course it is Jurrassic Park and I do encourage people to buy it, just because of that reason.  If you haven't seen it yet you should rent it soon.",1003190400,,2232,4.486352357320099

Sam Neill gives a tired performance in his return as Dr. Alan Grant, who is commissioned by a supposed millionaire and his wife to take them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna (the island where the dinosaurs had been created in the second film) as an anniversary present to them. Little does he know, they plan on landing on the island. Naturally all mayhem ensues, and let me tell you some of the scenes with the pterodactyls had me clinging to the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, the characters really are tired, Neill isn't the slightest bit solid and the dialogue verges on the ridiculously mundane. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are quite fun as the foolish couple, and Laura Dern is lovely in a small (and stupidly manipulative) appearance as her character Ellie Sadler.

There was a couple of spots that were totally not kid friendly for children under the age of 8. This one I took kids age 8, 9, 11, and 12.

1297470,4,B00003CXXR,"A great sequel in the JP series, JPIII is an efficient and tense rollercoaster ride that thrills and can leave you breathless.
 The story should have been more relevant to the franchise, but it is efficient and sometimes, fantastic. The screenplay is very good for a film of this kind. The dialogue is not awful, it's realistic. A group of ordanary persons lost on a island being hunted by dinosaurs won't recite Shakespeare.
 The editing is great, the cuts are perfectly placed and the pacing is smooth and adequate. It's running time (approximatelly 93 mins.) is a good issue about the editing.
 The visual effects are outstanding, dazzling. Many areas, trees and most of the dinosaurs were digital, and absolutely realistic. You can see the Brachiosaurus' muscles moving - it's just marvelous. The sound is detailed, the sound effects sometimes were haunting and loud. The film deserves an Academy Award nomination for it's Sound Editing, which is brilliant.
 Sam Neill is such an underestimated actor... His performance is subtle; he has created a great character in JP1 and now Dr. Alan Grant has evolved. His personality has a great charism. The rest of the cast is OK, except Trevor Morgan (the kid).
 The cinematography is very well done, the movie has a blue tone and the camera angles are efficient. The musical score is not as great as John Williams' score in JP1 and TLW, but it's not bad either. Don Davis created some fine themes, but the best still is John Williams' one.
 All in all, JPIII is one of the best sequels released this year (along with ""The Mummy Returns""). It's fun, tense and it has some of the most exciting action scenes ever captured in a film of this genre. The dinosaurs are as wild as never. If they decide to make a JPIV, the film should be as good as this one. Highly recommended.",1001203200,,1818,4.70125786163522
1297471,1,B00003CXXR,"I was somewhat looking forward to the advent of JP3. For me, JP2 was a bit of a logical let down, with someone or something killing off the crew of the freighter just as it arrived in San Diego. Who or what cleverly waited until land was in sight to do this? The movie never explained.
Whereas in JP2 shows mommy Tyrannosaura Regina romping through downtown and a very nice suburb somewhere in San Diego to find her baby, JP3 shows a human mommy (and daddy) searching for their child in the jungles of an island off Central America.
JP3 also took its leaps of logic. The pteranodons, who, until now, were housed in an enormous aviary, are provided freedom thanks to the mommy, daddy and company. If the pteranodons could not escape previously, how did they obtain their food? One of their nests shows the gruesome skeletonal remains of humans. When was the last time humans had wondered into this aviary? The island had not had any visitors in years -- yet we have just seen a nest with young littered with human bones?
When I left the theatre, I felt that the makers of the movie were laughing at us, that I had just wasted 90 minutes of my life and $6.00 of my money.",1001116800,2,1169,4.391705069124424

It appears as if it were slapped together very quickly. The best part about this movie is the return of Sam Neill. A mysterious couple(William H. Macy, Tea Leoni)want Dr. Alan Grant(Neill)to fly them over the dinosaur island. They say they are adventurers. Dr. Grant disagrees until they offer to help fund his projects. He agrees and it's off. The plane they are on crash lands onto the island and the couple reveal that they are not who they say they are. They have a secret agenda. That's all I'll say about that. The action scenes are really fun and exciting. Some of them were even better than The Lost World. Director Joe Johnston is a great director, and he does the best with a flimsy, barely there script. Tea Leoni is, I have to say it, annoying. She keeps yelling. The dinosaurs are impressive as always. They look as real as can be.

1297536,2,B00003CXXR,"This for me, again, was a lazy ""I'll treat myself to a movie"" type afternoon.  So, that said, I wanted to try to catch Jp3 before it left theaters.
To be brief, the movie used basically the same formula as the other two: people get trapped on the island and try to escape.  My problem with the movie was less with what it did and more with what it didn't do.
The first movie was a groundbreaking classic.  It gave the audience something it had never seen before, much in the same way that the fictional creator of Jurassic Park was trying to do.  The second movie seemed (and was) kind of forced due to the popularity of the original.  It was enjoyable, but even then, I remember one of the criticisms being that it wasn't really breaking any new ground.
Unfortunately the same holds true here.  It's not a particularly bad movie, it just that you keep getting the ""been-there-done-that"" impression that the franchise has nothing left to offer.
I've also read a few criticism of the ending.  Personally the ending disappointed me in that I thought it was the only interesting part of the movie.  How much more enjoyable would the movie had been if it was about, say, the marines reclaiming the island from hyper-intelligent Raptors (a-la Starship Troopers, or the classic Aliens)?  If nothing else, it would certainly put a new spin on things.  Because as it stands now, the only thing I took away from Jurassic Park III was the absolute certainty that the franchise had officially run out of steam.",1000512000,,1499,4.601503759398496

Instead, the kid in this is actually cool and the cast are excellent but as always the dinosours are the real stars and the reason most of us go to see these movies. This was by far the best in the series so far. I hope they do another one and that one of the dinosaurs will fall on Spielberg if he comes anywhere near the set!",1000425600,,656,4.298387096774194

As far as visual effects, they were rather remarkable, and succeeded (apparently, according to the number of 5 star reviews) in masking the actual, or lack of, plot, with little to no character development, leaving vital factors unexplained.
You would think that the director would've had the sense to at least draw out the recovery of the child, but no...the audience is rather bombarded with dinosaur attacks continually throughout the movie, eradicating any potential for the build-up of atmosphere....",1000425600,,531,5.409638554216867

Of course, they crash land on the island...and the fun begins, with director Joe Johnson treating us to one great action set piece after another. Particularly impressive were the pteradon scenes.

  Honestly, this is not even close to Oscar caliber material.  But this is one hell of a fun movie.  I walked in with little expectations for this flick, and I walked out very pleasantly surprised.  And I'm not even a big fan of the JP series.
  Oh yeah, for everyone who says this movie has no plot, let me just sum it up for ya.  You have a couple whose son is missing on the island.  It is known that dinosaurs inhabit the island.  So they lie to a dinosaur expert to get him to come along.  Then their plane goes down.  So not only do they have to find the son, but also a way off the island.  And when Dr. Grant finds out he's been lied to, he's none to happy or cooperative.  That sounds like a pretty in depth plot to me, at least for a summer popcorn movie!

1297541,2,B00003CXXR,"The first Jurassic Park was better, the second worse.  The elements that made the first one good were not here.  Bigger and meaner do not always equal scarier, as with the newest dino, egyptus spinasaurus (or something).  The inevitable is not so frightening in comparison with the unknown, the unexpected.  You know the E.S. saw you, you know he's coming after you, you know you can outrun him because you are a good guy and it's a movie.  Big deal.  With the T-Rex though, who knows if he saw you?  If he saw where you stopped, will he look for you there?  Did he see you twitch?  That is the kind of fear that eats at a person's stomach.

The only thing that scared me during the movie was expectation.  It's too quiet, I think.  I grip the arm rest of my chair, waiting, dreading for some monstrosity to pop up and bite somebody's head off.  What I feared, though, was never as scary as what finally happened, so just a few hours after the movie I found myself thinking that there was nothing really scary about the whole thing. This coming from a person who is still traumatized by the kitchen scene from the first movie.
Bottom line:  If you really liked the earlier movies and you find your curiosity cannot be quenched until you see this movie, don't let me get in the way, but don't walk in there with any expectations.  If you want to see a tense, nail-biting flick that will make you jump, well, this ain't it.

My reccomendation to those of you wh still enjoy a movie with an actual story, go to the independent film industry, sure, you won't have the multi-billion dollar shoot outs, or the big tall scary looking monsters, but is that all movies are about? I say make Hollywood go bankrupt, and give that money where it belongs, to the poeple starving on the streets. Because where Hollywood is going, I'm almost starting to believe the T.V. brainwashing America stuff going around. This is a desperate attempt to rack in a few million dollars off of a somewhat reputable franchise. Please, do not see this movie. The story is insulting, the ending even more so. If you want to see a good thriller, I would reccomend Silence of the Lambs, Manhunter, or even Hannibal over this. This movie just isn't very good.",999302400,5,1234,4.639269406392694

So-so character development. A cheap story that was probably written on the back of a cocktail napkin before handed to some hack screenwriter. But the acting is pretty good, for the most part.
I noticed a strange thing with this movie, in comparison to its predecessors. In part 1 and 2, the kids were annoying, and the adults were either dinosaur food or interesting. In part 3, the adults are all annoying (Except for Grant) and the kid is the coolest character. The movie practically said it to the audience when he talked with Grant, and it seems like he would be the main character of JP4 if it's ever made.
The special effects aren't too special. They're good, but not any better or worse than the original movie. Of course, that can be said about pretty much everything.
It's a decent rental flick, but don't kill yourself to see it unless you really love dinosaurs, or Jurassic Park is part of your life. I think most people would watch it and wish they were watching the original.",999302400,2,1223,4.415929203539823

It succeeds mostly because it doesnt try too hard to be a sequel to Jurassic Park, it seems like a film all on its own. If I had to complain about something, the kid story is far too unbelievable to trick even the dumbest viewers and the characters sometimes do dumb things. Despite that I really enjoyed Jurassic Park 3 and it kept me highly satisfied and entertained for the overly-short running time. The dinosaurs look fantastic, the film is awesomely entertaining and improves on the quality of the 2nd outing. The film also improves because it is much scarier than the first two Jurassic Park films. The scenes may not have as much build-up or suspense but in the moment, right then and there, they are absolutely horrifying, more so than the first two films. The new dinosaur creation, The Spinosaurs, also helps to give the film a slice of originality and creativity. The acting isn't great and the absence of previous director Steven Speilberg shows in dramatic scenes, but this remains a highly crowd-pleasing and enjoyable summer horror adventure flick that Im sure youll enjoy if you don't expect too much from it.

The movie was horrible, terrible plot, horrible acting, terrible concepts, [bad] looking dinosaurs, and it doesnt start there, that became obvious in about the first 10minutes.

Unfortunately, this film only delivers the action scenes, without any substance to back it up. The scene when the group crashes on the island is impressive, with great fx work showing the new dino trashing the plane like its garbage. It's followed by a short but brilliant fight between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex, showing the Spino victorious. This may be short, but it's probably realistic and i have no complaints with it. I also liked the raptors in this film, they had some suspenful scenes, mainly when they are trying to retrieve their stolen eggs. It's very well done and keeps the movie with some suspense and as usual, the dino's look great. The Raptor and Spinosaurus chases are also impressive giving us some nice FX to look at. But the best scene in the whole movie is the Pheratons(spelling?) scene. Its masterfully done with a great mix of real and special effects to create one of the best action scene's of the past decade. It's brilliantly done, and has some suspense as to the outcome of it.
Anyone notice that all the great parts about this movie are in the action? the storyline for this movie is [terrible] actually, and in some parts very unbelieveable. The parents allowing the kid to go anywhere near an island were many people have died and the fact that he survived for 3 weeks is very stupid. The plot is also predictable and you know whether a character is going to be killed or live in some scenes and it makes the characters boring and not nessesary. What dissapointed me the most was that i thought the JP series was going to have the guts to kill of a main character like the father or mother in the movie, or even the little child. It would have added alot more drama to the movie and made it much more interesting and made us much more involved in the film then were are now.
  So overall this movie is a mixed bag. It does provide excellent special effects and some magnificant action sequences. The return of Sam Neill is also a big treat.

Sure, it wasn't as exciting or as original as the first JURASSIC PARK, but it's for the people who wanted to see more dinos and know more about what happened to Jurassic Park after the first movie...for people who wanted to go further into the story. I went opening night and really enjoyed it! The only thing that bugged me was the fact that these two girls were sitting in front of me and they kept jumping at like, every time the dinos appeared on the screen. That really got annoying because they kept getting in the way!
Anyways, the whole plot of the movie was that Dr Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is paid to take some tourists (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni), across the island of Jurassic Park for their honeymoon. But once they are on the island, the couple tell the real reason why they are there - the two are divorced and are looking for their son, Eric (Trevor Morgan), who got lost on the island while para sailing. Laura Dern also makes a cameo role as her original character, Ellie, now ex-girlfriend of Alan Grant. I have to say that the truly outstanding actor in this whole movie is Trevor Morgan (THE SIXTH SENSE). He is a very good young actor and was the strongest actor in this film in my own opinion. If you get the chance to go see this film this summer definitely do so because it rocks! Joe Johnston is a very good director, too and lives up to all the exceptations. Whatever you do you must see this movie on the big screen 'cause it's even better on the big screen! It most definitely is worth your $8.00! Go see JURASSIC PARK III!",998352000,4,2061,4.397905759162303
1297631,1,B00003CXXR,"I am a HUGE fan of jurassic park. But let me point out that the first two Jurassic Park's were both (a) Direced by Steven Speilberg who is an extraordinary and accomplished director, who has won many many awards for outstanding cinematography, plot and directing; and (b) Both movies were based on books by Michael Crichton. I believe he is one of the most distinguished writers of our time. His obsession with detail, and unparalleled ability to create complex plots while still leaving a simple story, and the fact that his books THRILL the reader make him the ideal writer of a book about dinousaurs. Now I don't know who this Joe Bloggs fellow is but he made a mockery of the very idea that is Jurassic Park: Big, scary as hell dinousaurs eating small, frightened humans.
The dinousaurs basically [stunk]. I'm not talking about visually -the graphics were impressive. I am critisizing their effect as dinousaurs. What I liked about the dinousaurs in JP I and II was the terrifying intelligence and speed of the raptors, and the awesome power and strenght of the T-rex. However, in JP III a new, and frankly ugly spinosaur was found, which didn't make sense because they didn't engineer this one in JP I or II. This new addition made the T-rex look small, which it is NOT!! It was unsightly and lacked the look of a predator. The velociraptors were especially dissapointing. They didn't eat any of the humans, and their attacks were not very scary. They seemed to have lost their animality and feirce hostility to anything that moves. I was expecting blood and gore and guts and some terrifying escape-from-the-raptors scenes, but I was in vain. After all, we want to see blood and gore - thats what scares us, the fact that these animals are ruthless and terrible - terrible lizards. Not lizards that take so much care of 1 egg and then leave the humans alone. No, we want to see lizards that talk to eachother so they can eat MORE humans.  I have no complaints about the Pteradons; they were well done. But again; more people, some characters to dislike, so that when these characters are ripped apart viciously, we are happy. But only 2 people died in this movie. 2! I've never seen such a lack of appetite in any dinousaur movie.
Let me just repeat the comment my friend passed about this movie - ""A week after I saw JP III, I was still recoiling from how much it [stunk]""
Watch it, and let the movie speak for itself.",998352000,3,2425,4.587557603686636
1297632,1,B00003CXXR,"the only reason I am writing this review is that the rest of the reviews seem to have been written by studio executives, or people who didn't actually see the movie, for I can see no other reason why this total waste of 90 minutes could get a decent review. Where to start picking apart this terrible movie is a challenge itself, but the story seems the most appropriate place. The problem with the story was there was none. I know people are always saying I could write a better movie than that, and usually their wrong, but I honestly think that any writer could put together a better movie than this on the plane ride from San Fransisco to Los Angeles. From the first scene I was able to accurately predict which characters would live and die, and pretty much every surprise in the whole movie. The story didn't even really have an ending to speak of, it just seemed like the writer got tired of writing, and decidied to cut it off midway through.
The sound, cinematography, and action were all excellent the first time you saw them, in Jurassic Park 1. The whole movie was an attempt (unsuccessful might I add) to recreate the dramatic mood and ambiance of the first movie. Unfortunately like a photocopy it came out as a blury imitation of the origional, and something that is stupid even by B movie standards.
All of the actors were on complete cruise control, they seemed to realize how horrid the movie they were making was, and had the look of prostitutes just trying to get the ugly job done so they could go home. It's a shame that so much money was wasted making this movie, because it could have gone towards something productive, like paying back all the people who saw it.",998265600,3,1687,4.48051948051948

The very things that made Jurassic Park II so bad are absent in this movie--excessive screen time and plot spent on boring old human characters.  Instead there is a nice, simple B-movie plot to this film, and a good number of shots of dinosaurs.  I say good number because I would personally rather see a Jurassic Park movie where the humans are mere extras.  At any rate, there is an interesting  section here revolving around those villians of the first film, Velociraptors.  I don't want to give away too much, but one scene in particular where Sam Neill's character tries to fool them with certain sounds was particularly great!  There are also (finally) some scenes of flying dinosaurs (Pterosaurs, Pteranadons--how the heck would I know, I was a Soc. major) that go by way too quickly.  The movie is very tightly edited, and runs only about an hour and a half.  On the minus side, it did not appear to me that the computer-animated dinosaurs where as real looking as they were in the first two films, but they were still pretty darned good.  I'll even go out on a limb and say:  This is my favorite Jurassic Park movie of all three produced so far!  Give us more!",998265600,,1343,4.545833333333333

So unexpected was the ending that I actually blurted out ""You've got to be kidding""! in the theater, much to my embarassment. In hindsight, I should not have been surprised as it was a typical nice, neat, Hollywood ending.  In summary, I was entertained, the story and acting were fair and the dinosaur special effects were fantastic, it was just the film's tail ending that really disappointed me.",998265600,,654,4.7105263157894735

The dinosaurs are much better looking that the first two, and there is a sense of alarm when we see that the velociraptors can communicate with each other to go after the humans. This is a good movie, but I wish they would come up with a secondary plot in the next movies where we could get sucked in so that the dinosaurs could really surprise the adventurers, and us as well... New in this one are the pterodons and the spinosaurus.",998006400,,547,4.372549019607843
1297747,3,B00003CXXR,"Okay, this wasn't your typical pitiful sequel.  On the other hand, it does virtually nothing to progress the overall story.  The first film established the possibility of modern-day dinosaurs, and how mankind thinks they're God.  ""Lost World"" takes the next step, revealing that the problem isn't solved, and providing some deeper thoughts about the dinosaurs ... just because they were created in a lab, does that not give them the right to exist?
This movie, on the other hand, is just one little snippet.  The story is really about Neill's character dealing with events seen in ""Lost World,"" but in which he didn't get to participate.  There's action and good special effects, but it falls short of its potential.  The scene of the pterodactyls (or are they pteradons?) flying away from the island opens the door to what this movie should've done:  deal with the possibility that the dinosaurs could leave the island on their own.",998006400,,933,4.9423076923076925

However this evolution from the pomp and circumsatce of the Steven Spielberg helmed films was desperately desired and an ineviatble continuence for Jurassic Park as film franchise. It goes without saying that I substanually doubt that Jurassic Park would have had nearly half the box-office draw and phenomenonal business without the  expert cinematic manipulation and enthusiastic drive of Spielberg for a new watershed maturation of special effects. With abundantly lackluster storytelling performance of Lost Word: Jurassic Park, Spielberg was either preoccupied with other cinematic projects or creatively dry of anything drasticly new to add to the Jurassic Park forum.
With this third picture in the series, JP continues to frolic in it's massive box office appeal though creatively speaking, the dinosaurs may possiably again become extinct in years to come.",997920000,2,1295,5.815789473684211
1297791,5,B00003CXXR,"I still remember that day long ago (2 1/2 years) when I finished reading the Junior novelazation of Jurrasic Park 2. The last 2 sentances went like this ""they would never be seen by humans again. Maybe"" Maybe. The one word that instantly told me that there was going to be another film. And so I waited 2 years, spent endless hours researching the film on the internet, becoming a member of a great fan site Dansjp3page.com, writing stories, and eargely counting down the days untill it came out. Finially the day it came out I couldent see it because I was on a boy scout camping trip. I somehow managed to convince my scoutmaster to take me and a few others who wanted to see the movie to a local theater in the dead of night to see it. I went in and sat down, watched the exciting previews and my heart started to race when the words ""Jurrasic Park III"" showed up on the screen. Did I enjoy it? Oh you betcha.
Jurrasic Park III is the best action film this year has seen so far. Its better then ""Apes"" its better then ""Mummy"" and its definiatly better then the awful ""Peal Harbor"" It delivers, with a great plot, great charachters, and fantastic action.
The action in Jurrasic Park III is withoubt a doubt some of the best ever featured in the series, from the plane crash to the boat attack, every single one is a classic. The brand new spinosaurus is really cool, even better then the T-rex (Who only gets about a minute and 30 seaconds of screen time) The special effects are still spectacular the 3rd time around, in fact, there so good, they should win a oscar.
The human charachters are interesting, including everyones favorite paleontologist Dr Alan Grant, a suspicious couple, Grants assistant, a tennager who survives the longest period in the jungle in any of the movies, 8 weeks, 3 supporting gung-ho charachters, 2 of whom become dino chow in 10 minutes after you meet them.
Jurrasic Park has been a series full of deaths and thankfully, this movie has the least amount of eaten people, a total of 4 people die in the film. So the sickining violence is kept to a minimum. However this film features the most gruesome and disgusting corpse ever featured the series. It is so sickining to look at that eveyone in the theater went ""Uhhh!"" when they saw it. It shows up when the group pulls on the crashed parisail, so be warned, kids may have nightmares for days afterwards.
One of the greatest new additions to the film is its great sense of humor. All of the jokes (Most of wich involve a cell phone) are very funny to look at. Some of them are so funny they should have put ""The suprise comedy hit of the summer!"" on the movie posters. One unintentionally amusing joke is lisiting to the new raptors ""Talk"" to each other. Its actually very funny.(Can you find the ""Rippling water"" tribute to the first film?)
Granted this film is not withoubt its problems. For instance how can a thingy survive in the stomach of a dinosaur for 3 days?  . Also why did universal promote the raptors so much? although they may be more inteligent they are actually not a threat. In fact, they only kill one person! Once you figure out why the raptors are following the humans its actually kind of silly to think that the raptors were promoted so much. The next biggest problem with the movie is its ending. If you are expecting a exciting ending, your going to be dissapointed. The biggest problem is the movies lenth, its only 1 hour, 32 minutes and 2 seaconds long! I don't know about you but that seems really short. Also, watching the ending leaves the door wide open for another sequel! (its been confirmed that a 4th one is in development) Its like the producers are holding up a sign saying ""Hah Hah, were going to make another sequel, Ha Ha!"" But beyond its problemes Jurrasic Park III is a great film. Go see it. I cant wait for my 4th viewing. If you had any doubt about the series after the last film, this movie will put those to rest. It was definiatly worth the wait.
The good: Lots of action, Really cool dinos, good charachters, good story.
The bad: bad ending, Spino vs. T-Rex battle is too short (1 minute exactly) dissapointing ending
And the ugly: inevitable sequel to this sequel, too dang short!",997833600,,4214,4.472727272727273
1297792,4,B00003CXXR,"Ok, let me the first to say, ""no this movie will not win an award for anything"".  The movie does lack on originality, but what it looses there, it makes up in comedy.  I dislike the fact that many people are dissing this movie without even thinking of the failure of Lost World.  This movie is head and shoulders above that, but doesn't equal the original.  It is a far better ride with Grant as the lead character, Ian was far too eccentric and at times you wondered why he had survived.  The worse part of the movie is the ending, by far.  The way this ended was not a way that it should have.  The movie does breath a little fresh air into the series though, due mostly to the Spinasaurs.  Also a VERY weak angle was introducd with the discovery of talking Raptors.
If you were left with a bad taste in your mouth after the Lost World or if you want to see hope in the JP series, this movie gives you a little of it.  But if your looking to at this with hopes of it surpassing the first, its not there.  Go to this movie, expect nothing out of it that is the best way to enjoy it, that way your not disappointed.

 The script was a quick job done by a new jack who didn't take the time to think it through.

The effects were breathtaking and the dinos were scarier than ever!  I admit that it's nowhere near as good as the original, but nothing can match that movie ;-)  The plot was clever and interesting and kept you guessing.
Tea Leoni impressed me!  I never knew she was so talented!  Her character was pretty stupid and deserved to be killed, but I was okay with her sticking around!  Alessandro Nivola was superb!  He's so cool!  He can play an upperclass aristocrat in 'Mansfield Park' and then come down and play around with dinosaurs in 'JP3'.  Very impressive, Alessandro!
It was great to finally have some flying dinos!  I was little disappointed that there weren't any in the previous two, but there were enough here to satisfy me!  They were very realistic!

There was practically NO character development. Yes, I expected character development - I also expected, as in the first two movies, that the dinosaur scenes would DRIVE the story. Instead, they were sprinkled about as if to fulfill some quota. Sure, there were lots of dino scenes, but most of them had no bearing on furthering the lame story line, such as it was. Wrenching?

Unlike previous Jurassic adventures, most of the serious chomping of actors is finished in the first few minutes on the Island. The rest of the film is a survival fest, with plenty of new dinos to get your attention.
Personally, I would have loved to see Tea Leoni's character get eaten, as she was annoying me through most of the movie. I also had a bit of a problem with William Macy. Sam Neill is right on track however.
My biggest beef with the film, besides the contrived methods of escaping dinos, is the ending. It sets up another Jurassic ride, but forces you to suspend belief. I do not want to give it away, so you will have to see it to believe how low they have sunk here.
Once again, if seeing some neat, new dinos is your cup of tea, you will love this film. The action is fast paced and there are plenty of ""Oh, my God"" moments to keep you glued to the screen. If you like story, substance, and believability, look elsewhere.",997401600,2,1086,4.302439024390244
1297840,3,B00003CXXR,"Hey, let's face it, dinosaurs are cool.  Dinosaurs have always been cool and any movie with dinosaurs in it is worth watching.  The original ""Jurassic Park"" cashed in on this fact but distorted what we came to look at (the dinosaurs, duh) with an overly complicated script.  For my money the second film topped the first by dispensing with a competent script almost entirely and, instead, giving us more of what we wanted to see (dinosaurs, duh).  Which brings us to the third film which, unfortunately, really doesn't have anything new to show us.  Although back in the time of the original ""Jurassic Park"" the computer generated technology was new and exciting, now it is starting to become old hat.  Not just from the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, but from other movies (Phantom Menace, the terrible Godzilla, and Disney's superb Dinosaur) that have used essentially the same technology.  Frankly, ""Jurassic Park III"" has nothing new to show us, and scenes of herds of dinosaurs milling about in a field aren't nearly as effective as they were in the first two films.
It seems absurd to criticize the plot in a film like this, after all it is just [inexpensive] summer entertainment (and we came for the dinosaurs anyway).  But the fact is now that we are not so awestruck by the dinosaurs anymore it is time to resort back to plot to carry the movie.  The direction this film should have gone would have been an adult version of disney's ""Dinosaur"".  By that I mean that the filmakers should allow us to get into the dinosaur's heads.  . . . . Instead we get the same old tired ""escape from dinosaur island"" plot that we have seen over and over again.
But you know, even a plot like this has its moments, and what ""Jurassic Park III"" has going for it is that it does present its mediocre ideas quite effectively.  There are a few really annoying scenes in which William H. Macy and Tea Leoni's broken marriage (apparently they got married back when Tea was still blind or something) starts to mend.  I'm sure that was suposed to be uplifting and all but who cares?  I was there to see the dinosaurs.  All in all, that's pretty much the key to enjoying the ""Jurassic Park"" movies.

First of all, the film's plot is pretty boring.  The original Jurassic Park's plot was very entertaining and interesting.  But, by now everyone basically knows what is going to happen in the film before they even see it.  I was hoping that the film was going to have a very exciting plot but it turns out that Sam Neil's character gets tricked into going back to the dreaded dinosaur island by a couple that secretly hopes to find their lost son.  I didn't think that Dr. Grant was so fickle to just say ""Oh well yeah I'll go back to the island that I was nearly killed on.""  Anyways the plot is so-so, the comic relief is actually pretty good.  JP III was the first film that I saw where it doesn't end, it sort of just stops.  And you think to yourself, ""is that it?  Is this what I payed money for?  To see THIS?""  I don't recommend seeing the film.  The only redeeming factors are the cool velocirapters, the spinosaurus/ T-rex showdown, and the comedy in the movie.  Other than that it wasn't that great.

1297843,4,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park III"" was everything that I expected, really. After ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", even though I liked it, was somewhat of a let down, I really wasn't expecting much from the 2nd sequel. But I got more then what I was expecting...
The main problem that Speilberg's 2nd installment had were scenes that seemed to be used for character development, but then they lead to nowhere. So what's left is some boring scenes that don't seem to matter, that you always skip when watching the DVD.
The 3rd installment does have one or two scenes like that, but they are a lot shorter and they actually have some relation to what's going on. Another plus for the movie is the return of Sam Niell's Alan Grant and an appearance by Laura Dern. This was a great idea, to connect this movie to ""Jurassic Park"".
""Jurassic Park III"" is nothing more then what it should be, a non-stop action packed 90 minutes. It's all a huge rush, just when the characters escape one danger, they find another. This movie also shows more of Velociraptor intellegence. In the previous films, they were said to be smart, yet they didn't do anything spectacular (except for opening a door and on hunting technique). But in this one, it turns out that they could ""talk"" to each other all along, this was a good idea. A lot of animals today do that, so it seem realistic.
The two highlights of ""Jurassic Park III"" are definatley: the Pteranodon scene, it was well worth the wait; the great Tyrannosaurus Rex & Spinosaurus battle in the jungle;  And to a lesser degree, the Brachiosaurs on the River Bank scene, where Joe Johnston seemed to try to recreate the awe of the first movie, and to a certain extend he succeeded.

Couple of questions about part 2. 1) How did the T-REX kill the captain of the ship in that tiny wheel room and every one on the ship and lock himself back up?  2) When they did leave site B (big mistake,HUGE!)and the T-REX was looking for a water source, why did it skip the bay and go to a chlorinated pool? My wife and I think we got it figured out, Spielberg said ""I've got special f/x and I'm gonna use 'em! Who cares about the story and if it makes sense?""  At least that's what we believe.  This is the sequel that part 2 should have been, it is better than 2 by leaps and bounds.  Bringing back Sam Neil and Laura Dern was a big help and whoever wrote this didn't get carried away with f/x, even though this movie does boast killer f/x.

1297846,3,B00003CXXR,"Actually, I'd give this movie three & a half stars, but since I can't I'll err on the side of caution.  All said, it was a fun flick to watch, and the digitally-created dinosaurs look better than ever........and that's why most people go to movies like this.  If you're looking for a ""realistic"" dino movie in terms of anatomy & pecking order, then this is not the movie for you.  From everything I've ever read about Spinosaurus Egypticus, I seriously doubt there's a well respected paleontologist around----Phil Currie, Bob Bakker, Jack Horner, Paul Sereno, or any others----who would guess that this predator would have been ""alpha"" to a Tyrannosaurus Rex.  In reality, it was nowhere near the size (in weight or in physical attributes) to a T-Rex, it's teeth were about half the size of a Tyrannosaur, and most experts think it mostly dined on fish.  But that's not the point here.  Movies of this nature are meant to entertain with fantasy as much as (or more so than) fact.  And in that respect, JP III gets the job done.  My two primary complaints are that A.) it should have been a little longer (please don't tell me you can run out of adventures when you're dealing with scientifically created dinosaurs), and B.) like the first two, the little-kid-as-a-focal-point angle is overdone.  Otherwise, just sit back, have your popcorn & soda, and enjoy the wild ride!

1297848,2,B00003CXXR,"Why don't they simply call these movies ""big scary monsters that chase screaming people"". And why persist with a [...] story line i.e. A Doctor of Paleontology and his star student, are mystifyingly duped by a deceitful couple into flying to a dinosaur infested island, ""what's going on? this isn't New York, it looks like a rough landing strip on a tropical islandwait don't land"". It would be easier and far less pretence to simply start the movie with our fearless group of misfit explorers already trooping through a jungle full of hungry dinosaurs. Why waste time with preamble? there isn't any story to begin with.
Some of the standard characters in the Jurassic formula are:
1. Professor (played by Sam Neill with a terrible American accent) His job is to utter jaw dropping facts about dinosaurs throughout the movie, such as, ""T Rex is constantly hungry, he marks each day on his calendar with  - kill and eat something"". Whenever he makes one of these statements watch out!  a sneaky dinosaur is in the neighborhood and is about ruin your day. It also provides the audience, who Hollywood believe are mindless morons, with valuable knowledge to help them keep up, ""they should have died out 75 million years ago"" (that's the dinosaurs not the mindless morons, although we can only hope). But there were plenty of mindless morons with very young kids in tow (I kid you not - sorry) in the cinema where I watched the movie.
2. Neurotic wife (horrible wooden acting) Separated and searching for her ten year old son who in an astonishing feat accidentally parasailed his way onto the island, (the things kids get up to these days! no marbles or scooters for him this Christmas, its sky scraper absailing or nothing). She encourages dinosaurs to chase everyone by bawling through a megaphone or screaming (she has a screaming alarm set for every ten minutes). Even though the Prof. tells her its not a good idea she does it anyway (I mean why should dinosaurs be allowed to snooze when the humans cant). In a bizarre twist of loyalties she proclaims undying love and devotion for her son but always manages to push him to the front of the line whenever a near death experience is about to happen. And then what does she do? Yep youve got it She was very impressive at outrunning an assortment of T Rexs, always in an open field no less.
3. The Dark and Brooding Loner (bad sunglass day) Not a major player but worth a mention. Sits motionless in the back of the plane staring (well we think he does but he never removes his sunglasses). Somehow hes in on the plot to get the Prof. on the island. But as the scriptwriter mercifully gave him very few lines he keeps you guessing. However, rule one in dinosaurs versus lost explorers; sinister looking men who never say much are usually dinosaur fodder. Invariably they always kick off the carnage with their snarling why don't you rip me apart taunt and velceloraptors are only too happy to oblige. Their demise is announced by a blood curdling scream of epic proportions somewhere deep in the jungle, causing frenzied glances from the rest of the party. Anyhow he did get the best line in the film; asked by the Prof. what his connection to the neurotic wife and her husband was he replied we go to the same church hahahaha.
This movie is banal. The effects are very good however, but it is not a movie for young children to watch. T Rex is the star and the Pterodactals come a close second. The attempt to portray an intelligent kinder velceloraptor is hokey. Next thing you know Jurassic 4 will star house trained raptors in local pet shops. Heres his lead sir, youll need the optional step ladder to get it on, scratch his belly he loves that. Its about time this genre of film making becomes extinct",997142400,,3758,4.6158445440956655
1297849,3,B00003CXXR,"Though what would usually be considered in days past, ""the bottom half of the bill"", ""Jurassic Park III"" is B-movie fun at its best. The plot: hey, merely a framework to hang several action scenes on, and the characters: well, they can charitably be described as thinly drawn at best. But as with all great ""B"" movies, who cares? No one goes to films like this for great drama or acting (though there are some fine actors here). The film itself is well executed; director Joe Johnston helms several action sequences with great panache and a terrific sense of timing; dinosaurs are what we really paid to see, and that's what we get, in force. Aided in great measure by the brilliant teaming, once again, of FX masters Stan Winston and ILM, the dino's are breathtaking, and show us new things, such as the raptors running at full-gait (as they apparently could) and ""talking"". Add into this the Spinosaur (killing a T-Rex, no less, in a thrilling, but too short fight) and the flying dino's, and you've got a winning mix. Total fun!
Sam Neill returns (thankfully) to his role as Alan Grant, and William Macy and Tea Leoni are a (deceptively) rich couple who persuade Grant to return to Isla Sorna, only to have events turn out worse than they imagined.  The plot is stripped down enough for the action to get moving quickly; and get moving it does. Like all great ""B"" movies, character development and plot are subservient to really cool special effects, and this film delivers in spades. Johnston (Jumanji, Honey I Shrunk The Kids) knows how to mount a great set piece, and goes all-out here with several scenes that just mount and mount in terms of sheer audaciousness. Watch for the scene in ""the birdcage"" with the Paradactyls, emerging eerily from the mists on a metal bridge, snatching the kid and attempting to feed him to it's young.
This movie may perhaps become a modern version of a classic ""B"" (""Mighty Joe Young"", ""The Valley of the Gwangi"", ""This Island Earth""). Excellent effects, slightly-hammy screenplay, ridiculous premise; but hugely fun and always watchable.",997056000,,2078,4.788300835654596
1297860,3,B00003CXXR,"Though not quite as good as the first two, JPIII is nonetheless a decent time-killer of a movie.  Clocking in very briskly at less than ninety minutes, the premise is pretty much a slight variation on what it previously was--humans getting stuck on an island that they ultimately wish they hadn't got stuck on.  Though the humans always take a very distant back seat to the dinos, original star Sam Neill is always a welcome sight, returning here to guide a couple in search of their missing son.
William H.Macy and Tea Leoni are completely wasted as the parents, and the few moments in which they attempt remnants of a relationship are forced and not well-written.  As Neill's protege, Alessandro Nivola serves as the film's eye candy(and very well I might add), though to this credit, he does attempt some surface fleshing out of his character in the limited time he's on screen.  Of course, the stars here are the dinos, and as is typical the special effects are first-rate--they even assign some slight distinguishing features to those nasty raptors.  Overall, a pleasant enough diversion, though the producers might want to consider closing this park up for good this time.",997056000,,1178,4.87

This dinosaur is the meanest creature I have ever encounted so far with the exception of T-Rex, but even T-Rex wasn't so mean in this film.  This dino was the best I have seen and the scene where they are standing by the fence and they hear the cell phone go off and they turn around and Spinosaurus is just standing there watching them and then starts charging, that was the absolute best and scariest to me.
I highly recommend this movie to serious movie goers.  The Jurassic Park series is becoming one of the best I have ever seen and one I will own and cherish for a long time to come.  I'm looking forward to more sequels.
Of course, the first one was just fantastic because it was something no one has ever seen before, but they just keep on getting better and better.  I highly rate this movie with 5 stars.",997056000,,921,4.2701149425287355

  Well, now Spielberg isn't directing, more of the original cast is back fom the original, and it's still quite fun!  The overall plot is kinda silly to get the main guy played by Sam Neill onto the island, but who really cares.  You're staring at spectacular special effects.
  The movie would be lost without introducing the Spinosaurus, which is bigger than the T-Rex, cause weve seen the raptors before.  Overall, it's pretty silly, but this is mindless entertainment, and it's only 90 minutes long, so it doesn't drag on for too long.  Recommended for fun!",996969600,,808,4.594405594405594

Director Joe Johnston does a fine job at filling Steven Spielberg's shoes. His style of direction is very reminiscent of the previous two films.
The cast is fairly good, at least for a summer blockbuster. Sam Neill reprises his role from the first film and does a good job at doing so. William H. Macy is a welcome addition to the cast. Tea Leoni gives a noteworthy performance but does come off as being somewhat annoying, though.
The story is, by no means, groundbreaking. The screenwriters borrow many elements from the first two films but add some of their own ideas. A new cast and new dinosaurs also help in making the film appear to be more original.
While Don Davis's musical score isn't as majestic and powerful as John Williams's score for the previous films, it does serve its purpose of heightening the action.
The special effects are very good but not quite up to par with those of the first film. The CGI dinosaurs have a `computer tint' to them. The animatronic dinosaurs are quite convincing, however.
I only have two real complaints with this film. Where the first film was perhaps too slow in its pacing, this one feels very rushed; some scenes fly by and don't give you an opportunity to catch your breath. With a running time of only 90 minutes, one would think the film could have been lengthened to further develop the story. The finale is also a little too `audience friendly.'
I doubt we'll see many summer blockbusters, this year, that will be more entertaining than this.",996796800,3,1755,4.664516129032258
1297867,3,B00003CXXR,"The first 'Jurassic Park' was amazing, the visuals and the story was just a big advancement in film.  But the 'Jurassic Park' series is one that I have never quite taken seriously.  I watch them because in the end, they're a lot of fun, and when you get down to the bottom...why even try to judicate this movie?  There are so many things I could whine about, the script, the acting, the plot, etc.  But I'm not going to, because when you tear apart a movie like this you sound more idiotic than the movie itself.  I must say that yes the movie could have been more action packed and yes 10 minutes longer would've made it quite nice.  Of course I love William H. Macy, one of my personal favorites, Tea Leoni I could give or take...But what this movie is, is its a big blockbuster movie that you aren't supposed to think about, just see it, have fun and leave knowing that your money has gone to make another sequel...",996796800,,918,4.308139534883721

The trouble is, also included in this movie are a bunch of actors trying to make do with a rather meagre and predictable plot. Some of them are pretty good actors, too. William H. Macy does what he can with the storyline and his lines in specific, and Sam Neill is as likable and convincing as ever, but it is all too obvious that a lot of formidable talent was wasted on what is clearly a vehicle for the dinosaurs. And whenever those aren't around, the plot steps into the foreground as the major tedium that it is. Relief comes only in the form of Spinosaur, the Raptors (sans dino-fuzz), Pterosaurs and the rest of'em. The dearth of substance in this film probably accounts for its comparative brevity, which you may also consider a relief. Anyway, if you can't get enough of perfectly rendered dinosaurs stomping and bellowing in Dolby Surround Sound on a big screen and don't care too much about the story, you'll get your fix for sure.

It also isn't as nearly suspenseful as the others, although I think the story is better than the Lost World. The movie also doesn't bring back as many of the old characters. The only major character is Dr. Alan Grant. Dr. Ellie Sattler is only in one scene, and Ian Malcolm isn't in it at all. And the worst of all - NO T-REX!!! The main suspense factor of the movies is replaced by another dinosaur. Although the Spinosaurus is a good edition to JP, I still like the T-Rex better. The T-Rex is only in one scene, and it's being attacked by the Spinosaurus! Another character not in the movie is the owner of the park, John Hammond. The movie synopsis goes like this: When Dr. Alan Grant thinks he's out of a job because of Jurassic Park, he decides to find more about velociraptor's intelligence. He finds out that they had the power to talk to each other. Even though Grant vows never to return to the island of Isla Nublar, a wealthy tourist, Paul Kirby, and his wife, Amanda, persuade Grant to be their guide on an aerial tour of a neighboring island, Isla Sorna, InGen's Site B seen on The Lost World. Grant thinks it's just a quick flight, but when the plane lands on the island, Grant finds out that Kirby is actually not a wealthy tourist, but an owner of a small tile company who is trying to find his son, who was trapped on the island from a parasailing accident near the island. But when Kirby realises the dangers on the island and takes the plane off, they crash into ""something"" and get caught in a tree. There they meet the Spinosaurus as it rips apart their airplane in an attempt to find the survivors. The group decides to look for Kirby's son, but when Grant's apprentice scientist decides to take home a souvenir raptor egg, they encounter life-threatening dangers - raptors setting traps, attacking Pteradons, and swimming Spinosaurus's. After they find the boy, their only hope may be a satellite phone, in the Spino's stomach. I'd only see the movie in theaters once, but probably buy it on Video/DVD.",996710400,,2200,4.5025

1297912,5,B00003CXXR,"I have been a Jurassic Park fan since the first time I saw the original in theaters at the age of 8 years old. Jurassic Park both scared me and fascinated me. It was a movie that was both intelligent and action-packed at the same time. Needless to say, it sparked a huge interest for me in dinosaurs and forced my parents to spend big money on lots of toys. I was severely disappointed with The Lost World. It was like a 2 and a half hour long Burger King commercial with cardboard cut-out characters and a plot that made no sense. With Jurassic Park III, I knew I was in for a treat. JP3 puts aside the pretentions of the 2nd movie and instead gives a straight visual treat. For those of us who have read the two Jurassic Park books, you will notice many scenes in this movie were taken from the books, which is good, because I was always disappointed how the movies left so much of the book out and I wanted so badly to see it all on film, and this movie delivers for that margin of people like me. The story is very basic, Alan Grant is tricked into going to Isla Sorna, the breeding ground for the Dinosaurs, by a rich, divorced couple, looking for their son who is stranded on the island. Of course, the minute the plane ""lands"" the dinosaurs give the visitors a rough welcome. Alan and co. discover that InGen had been breeding new breeds of dinosaurs and surprisingly, not many people die in the process. Some of the scenes in this movie are a little bit disturbing for little kids (I saw at least 3 different parents taking their kids out of the movie half-way through) but the whole movie was described just like the settings in the book. If you were a fan of the original and you want a good movie to go see on a hot 95 degree day, drive to the nearest air-conditioned theater and check Jurassic Park III out, you're guaranteed a good time.",996624000,,1850,4.273504273504273
1297913,5,B00003CXXR,"First came Jurassic Park. One of the greatest films in history. I saw that at the theaters more than seven or eight times, and I was pretty young. Then, four years later, came The Lost World. Not good. I expected too much out of it, and what was the stuff about T-Rex getting onto San Diego. Let's keep them on the island, I ended up only seeing it maybe three times in theaters. And I'm still debating on whether I should buy the DVD. And now, ironically, four years later, Jurassic Park III hits the big screen. I am one of those hardcore JP fans, and I must say that this movie was one of the greatest sequels Hollywood has ever made.
When I first heard of them making another sequel, I thought, ""Oh man."" But then, the news started rolling in. Sam Neill is going to reprise his role as the infamous Dr. Alan Grant, who was sorely missed in the second film. I thought he did such a fantastic job, that he topped all of his other films. Then came Laura Dern as a cameo. She does a great job, and it seems to be more than just a cameo role. It was a vital role for this film to be a success. William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, and Trevor Morgan, make the characters realistic, and I'm not usually a fan of Tea's, but this film made me want to go back and see her other films.
Then, of course, there are the dinosaurs. Spinosaur kicked major butt in this film. He knocked the crap out of T-Rex. The raptors were finally smart. The first one, they were mysterious. In the second one they were clumsy and stupid, but in this one they were very intelligent. They learned to set traps, and learned to look at all their options before attacking, thus proving Grant's theory about their intelligence. I've only seen it once, but trust me, it won't be the only time. I plan to see this film more than ten times in theaters, and, not to mention, buy the DVD when it comes out in December. Speilberg did an excellent job producing, and Joe Johnston deserves great recognition for this phenomenal picture.

Remember your absolute dread when the original T-Rex was breathing on the kids' jeep???  The action in this crowded movie is so incessant that one misses the epic sweep and sheer wonder of the original.  Instead, this new take on the story concentrates on the special effects, of which there are lots and lots, and on some zippy, fresh, funny dialog.  Forget the plot, characters do not really matter in these movies after all...still, the visual splendor is hard to beat, and you are bound to have a nostalgic feeling as you watch the lumbering beasts move across the movie screen -- it reminded me in feeling to JAWS II, which was not a disaster but which paled in comparison to the original.

The Lost World broke that mold with unrealistic acting and a poor excuse to return to Jurassic Park.  This, the third installment in the Jurassic Park series, does much better than Lost World, but fails to bring back the same feel of the original.
To start out with, the film is far too predictable.  Of COURSE ***SPOILER*** Billy took the eggs, Of COURSE Billy wasn't really dead. ***END SPOILER***  These things were far too easy to call in the course of the movie.
The scares are sometimes predictable (raptor in glass tube) but are mostly genuine.  All in all, they're fun.
The acting is superb on the part of William H. Macy, T`ea Leoni, and Sam Neill.  Trevor Morgan seems plastic at times, but generally, plays a brave lost boy genuinely.  Of course its good to see Alan Grant back, and apparently the cast thinks so as well, as they all seem to flock to him constantly throughout the flick.

1297978,4,B00003CXXR,"After seeing The Lost World, I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about seeing Jurassic Park III when I heard it was coming out.
Regardless, I saw it the night it opened, and I have to say it was a good deal better than the previous installment.  It served its purpose as a sequel and a summer movie, without being sloppy and tedious.
I was very glad to see that Sam Neil had returned as Alan Grant.  His presence was sorely missed in The Lost World.  Many dinosaurs also returned, in addition to some new ones.  The spinosaurus being the most notable. Its grand entrance was nothing short of spectacular, and the fight between it and the T-Rex memorable to say the least.
As much as I enjoyed seeing all the familiar faces, its too bad there weren't any familiar sites.  I had hoped this movie's story would center around the island Isla Nublar, where the first Jurassic Park had taken place.  It would've been nice to see that towering wooden Jurassic Park doorway again, or the visitor center, or even the raptor pen.  And what ever happened to the Dilophosaurus'?  When I walked through a department store, and saw that particular dinosaur figure in a box with the new JP3 logo, I naturally assumed they'd make an appearance in the movie.  But they didn't Oh, well.  Maybe next time.
Anyway, I thought this movie was great none the less.  It offered more dinosaurs, more of the original cast, great action sequences, and it managed to stay under two hours.  After seeing this, I actually look forward to the next Jurassic Park movie.
And another thing.  Many people have said that this movie is actually a prequel to The Lost World.  That's not true.  You find that out less than ten minutes into the movie, when Alan Grant refers to the San Diego incident during his lecture.",996537600,2,1774,4.6050955414012735

I also think that the dinosaurs theme is something that doesn't impress people who saw the first two films (although I think this one is better that THE LOST WORLD) Some stuff, on the other side, are really really cool, like the new dinos (the spinosaurus was great, but some more T-rex would have been better), the pteranodons (or the flying guys) and the new and improved raptors (how did they get all those stripes and ""feathers""?)

Another thing that befuddled me was when Sam Niell fell asleep on the plane and dreamed that a raptor was talking to him.  I actually laughed out loud (not the only time during this movie)!  As for the dinos, some of them looked great but an equal number of them looked faker than anything I'd ever seen in a movie.

I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts.

All of the inherent ethical questions were handled (and handled well) in the original Jurrassic Park, so The Lost World shouldn't have tried. In this one, new director Joe Johnston (October Sky; Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) takes a more direct and linear approach to a sequel. He sets up a plausible reason to return to one of the dino-infested islands, he gets the main cast stuck there, and lets the dinos chase them around the island to a convienent escape. And as any sequel should, he delivers bigger and badder monsters. And a child companion (performed well by Trevor Morgan) which, for the first time, doesn't make you grown. Alan Grant, my favorite character from the original, also returns as a main character. Likable characters, fairly solid plot, and terrific new baddies all make this the sequel that TLW should have been. The only reason I take off a star is the rather poor explanation of how the new dinosaurs got on the island. According the one-line explanation, they've been on the island since before TLW. Considering the fact that the spinosaurus was everywhere on the island, we should have seen him in The Lost World. Do yourself a favor and go see this film.",996364800,4,1228,4.716279069767442
1297985,4,B00003CXXR,"""Jurassic Park III"" attempts to pull a new twist on the source material of the first film, taking us to a new place where new dinosaurs will soon be wreaking havoc on human kind. Does it work? Completely! Combining some very effective action sequences with some of the bets humor for a movie of this genre, ""JP3"" is a thrill machine that doesn't portray itself as anything more or less. One might sneer at the drawn-out franchise, but there's no denying how much fun this film can be on many levels.
The movie brings back the original character of Alan Grant (Sam Neill), who is now a college professor of paleontology. He hopes that his new theory of raptor intelligence will inspire his students as well as earn some funds for his research, though his students seem more interested in his experiences at Jurassic Park so many years ago, experiences he would rather put behind him than rehash to the world.
That is, until Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy, Tea Leoni) come calling, with the promise of those needed research funds in exchange for Grant coming along with them to the island of Isla Sorna, the second island where the action of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" took place. Posing as tourists with a taste for adventure, their true intent is to locate their lost son, who they believe to be located on the island after a boating accident eight weeks earlier.
Once Grant finds out their true intentions, he demands that the mission be aborted, but soon, their plane crashes on the island, leaving them stranded among the carnivorous creatures, who are quick to start scaring the hell out of their new prey. Along with some new and quite dangerous dinosaurs, the velociraptors prove Grant's theory of raptor intelligence correct, though I'm sure he was none too thrilled about being right when he finds himself surrounded by them.
Like the first ""Jurassic Park,"" ""JP3"" brings on its share of action sequences and suspenseful moments, which are a sheer delight for those who enjoy a good jolt. I was sitting up in my seat after the plane crash, as the never-before-seen spinosaurus tosses the wreckage around like a child's toy. A fight between the spinosaurus and a tyrannosaurus rex is charged with intensity, and the group's fight to stay alive is made all-the-more challenging by a high quotient of prehistoric predators.
The film also explores what ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" merely conceived in words. The whole basis for that film was the creation of prehistoric life on the second island, and this movie takes us to the many sites of that creation, as well as showing us their attempts to contain that life in cages. One of those settings is a bird-cage, where pteranodons retrieve their prey for their young. The compound where our group finds temporary refuge recalls that of ""Jurassic Park,"" where the story all began.
Combined with the action is a heavy load of comic relief, lying within some very witty dialogue and situational humor, lightening the impact of scenes that would otherwise be too intense for younger audiences. Even so, this humor is a delight for all ages. At one point, Grant gives the group an ultimatum, to either search for their missing son or follow him, to which the pilot soon after replies, ""We'll search for your son, in the direction he's going."" Another situation finds them looking for a cell phone in a large pile of dino droppings, possibly one of the funniest scenes in a movie yet.
The cast seems to be having fun with the film. Sam Neill is as good as new in his reprisal of the role of Alan Grant, the same wit and intelligence pouring from him with ease. William H. Macy makes for a lot of good laughs as the cumbersome Paul, And Tea Leoni plays a well-mannered damsel in distress as his wife. Grant's protg, Billy, is played by Allesandro Nivola, and after this film, we can expect to be seeing more of him in the future.
The summer season is a time when movie studios bombard audiences with films full of action and humor, with little care for plot or substance. Surprisingly enough, ""Jurassic Park III"" surpasses any negative expectations you may have (believe me, I had my own). Director Joe Johnston may be no Speilberg, but his latest film beats out some very stiff competition, from ""The Mummy Returns"" to ""Pearl Harbor,"" to become the best summer movie of the year!",996364800,41,4343,4.723320158102767

A movie like this is supose to keep you glued to your seat or at least give you the rush of scareing you out of it. This movie just didn't do that. The other two movies made you want to see them again and again, but this one doesn't hold that kind of carisma. I think that they should call this movie a bad dream and let Stephen and Michael do there magic on the next instalment of the series...",996364800,,733,4.318840579710145
1298038,4,B00003CXXR,"The dinosaurs are back and they're bigger and better than ever, in this third installment that expands the series that began in 1993, and it still awe-inspiring in it's grandeur and size.  ""Jurassic Park III,"" directed by Joe Johnston, reunites Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) with his old friends the raptors, when some contrived circumstances land him back on the island (actually, the second island this time around) and he has a chance-- however unwelcomed-- to discover even more about these magnificent beasts, including the intelligence level of the raptors that he always suspected but could never prove.  And before it's over, he'll know a lot more, but at a price he'd rather exchange for ignorance than pay if he had it to do over again.
 As far as Grant is concerned, Jurassic Park is history and something he'd just as soon forget.  And he definitely had no intention of ever going near one of those islands again, but just as the funding for his archeologic dig is about to dry up, a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) shows up with deep pockets and a willing checkbook.  It seems that Kirby and his wife, Amanda (Tea Leoni) are adventure seekers, and for their wedding anniversary they've received permission from the Costa Rican government for a low fly-by over Isla Sorna, where the products of InGen are still thriving and roaming about freely.  They want Grant along as a kind of tour guide, and though his instincts tell him not to do it, he reluctantly agrees for the sake of his dig.  And after all, it's just a simple fly-by and they won't really be getting close to the island at all.  But we all know better than that, don't we?  Soon Grant and the Kirbys, along with their pilot and two other gentlemen, are winging their way toward the land that Grant wishes Time would've forgot.
 The plot is fairly simple and straightforward, the cast is great, the special effects are outstanding, and Johnston keeps it all on track and moving right along.  Most importantly, it's fun and exciting, with just enough tension to keep you going until the end.  It's a far cry from the original ""Jurassic Park,"" but that is to be expected; there's no way to recapture that special sense of wonder evoked by that very first glimpse of the island and those dinosaurs, and that's what really separates the original from the sequels.  You can only discover something once, and after that it becomes a matter of simply pursuing more of the same.  But it's kind of like discovering chocolate cake; that first time is great, even something special, but it doesn't mean you don't enjoy it just as much the next time around, especially if it's good cake.
 Malcom is sorely missed in this one, but it's good to see Dr. Grant back, and Sam Neill slips comfortably back into the role as if he never left, picking right up where he left off without missing a beat.  And Macy can always be counted upon to deliver a solid performance, no matter what role he's playing; he's simply one of the best character actors in the business, and he does an excellent job of bringing Kirby to life here.  Tea Leoni is also a welcome addition to the ""JP"" family, and though this part is hardly a stretch for her as an actor, she makes her character believable, and she and Macy work very well together.
 The supporting cast includes Michael Jeter (Udesky), Alessandro Nivola (Billy), Trevor Morgan (Eric), John Diehl (Cooper), Bruce A. Young (Nash) and Laura Dern (Dr. Ellie Sattler).  This isn't a film that purports to be insightful or anything more than what it is, which is good, solid entertainment.  But like space shuttles and Moon walks, ""Jurassic Park III"" is a big movie that is bound to be taken for granted to a certain extent, which is kind of a shame.  Because from Steven Spielberg, who started it all, right on down through all the rest of the cast, crew, technicians (or perhaps we should call them ""magicians"") and all of the rest who contributed to the monumental task of bringing this film to the screen, they did a flawless job and made it look easy.  This may be pure entertainment, but it's also art in it's purest form, and the filmmakers responsible should be acknowledged for their achievement.  Contrary to what many may think, those dinosaurs didn't put themselves up there on the screen.  And a film like this is nothing less than a tribute to talent, dedication and craftsmanship-- and without a doubt, it's what the magic of the movies is really all about.",996278400,8,4469,4.649301143583227

When Dr. Alan Grant's theory of Raptor Intelligence reaches new grounds, he discovers that they may actually have been able to 'talk' to each other. However, with minimal funding and time on the project falling short, Grant is greeted by a pair of rich adventurers that, with the power of money, get Grant to go with them to Isla Sorna, a place he swore he'd never go. Enter: Spinosaurus. When Grant figures out the real reason as to why they are on Isla Sorna(after a knockout blow to the back of the head), it is too late: The landing party is quickly attacked by the new 'bigshot' Spinosaurus. Afterwords, the rest of the movie's weak plot unravels.
Unfortunately, the hype that this movie garnered did it no justice. Falling very short of expectations, we see a movie that opens up many questions which are never answered, plot holes that are glaring, and scenes that are just a bit too over-the-top, mainly the Velociraptor 'talk' scenes. The concept of Raptor talk was taken a bit too far for this film. The plot also underwent many revisions, as you will see with Laura Dern's 2 minute appearence, who supposedly originally had a larger role in the movie, but had a schedule to keep with other films. The ending also seems to have been thrown together in a couple of minutes.
The Spinosaurus is greatly exaggerated in this film, and the highly anticipated battle between the Rex and the Spino is just too unbeleivable and short. If a Rex were to bite down on a Spinosaurus' neck, beleve me, the Spino would be dead. Not so in this film, as the Spino, for some odd reason, takes center stage. Many questions open up which, again, are not answered, such as: Why didn't Malcolm and the group run into the SPinosaurus in The Lost World? Spinosaurus was not on Ingen's list of Dinosaurs, why not?
All in all, the action is great, but that is all that warrants the 3 star rating. Sam Neil is once again great as Dr. Alan Grant, and the Dinosaur effects, although a bit dated, still look very good. The worst aspects of the film are the convoluted and hokey plot, which is just too weak and basic to follow. You will also see that there are many scenes that were in Crichton's novel The Lost World that did not make into the Lost World movie reconstructed into this movie. Dinosaurs that were a part of the second book that were not featured in the second movie, such as Carnotaurus, make a very, very brief appearence. Nothing critical.
Another glaring problem: Over-advertising. While it wasn't as bad as the insanely over-hyped and terrible movie Tomb Raider, each TV spot that came on about Jurassic Park III revealed more and more scenes in the movie. So much was spoiled in the television commercials and, during the NBC spoiler that aired a week before its release during a showing of the original Jurassic Park, in which commercial breaks were hosted by Sam Neil that unfortunately gave so much of the movie away that, combined with the tv advertisements, one could've easily seen the entire movie without having to go the the theatre.
The bottom line: See it if you are a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, but don't expect another masterpiece. At best, this is an action movie spin-off of the sequel.",996105600,,3281,4.629502572898799

1298152,4,B00003CXXR,"Yes, JP3 is a worthy successor to the series. Many people are saying that it doesn't have the artistic, dramatic flare that Spielberg gave JP & LW, but it does tell a fairly decent story and still has some thrills to it. The acting is casually well-done and the score is the resonating theme from the first two movies, with subtle variation. Taken on its own it is a good film with a good plot. It is not as intense as the others.  I liked it. Could it have been better? Of Course, but Spielberg was both too busy and probably a little bored with dinosaurs, so he passed it on to a man who did a decent job. The good: inside jokes that require the audience to have seen BOTH of the other movies, nostalgia at the Isla Sorna set from LW, SAM NIELL and his hat, Pteradactyls (or Pteradons - whatever). Tea Leoni's reaction to a shocking surprise (did they or did they not tell her what was in the scene?). The not-so-good: No majorly intense moments that scare you. Some that had potential yet were not taken advantage of. Predictability in certain plot points that were made WAY TOO OBVIOUS, thus spoiling the surprise upon revelation of said plot points. Obvious set-up for a fourth movie: everyone has a sort-of ""apprentice"" of whom they could be paired with. This one is over half an hour SHORTER than the other two, which clocked in at just above two hours, but it would have dragged on if they had attempted to fill in that gap. Funniest thing in the Credits: ""MAN IN SUIT"" cast credit. Overall, this was a good movie. Funny moments, minimal use of dino-to-human violence compared to the others, but pretty good.",996019200,,1616,4.45945945945946
1298153,3,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park I was incredible, we as veiwers we sent into a whole new world of dinosaurs, and in that adventure we also found out quite a bit about dinosaurs.  In the second one we found out what would happen if a T-rex got caught in a big city, and of course that was disastrous.  The second one was less educational and more of a blood bath.  I understand that these movies were not supposed to be educational, but the educational part made it fun for the whole family.
The third and final film was the lesser of the latter two.  When it started it left you wondering, and when it ended it left you grumbling.  There are really only 2 kinds of dinosaurs that are portrayed in this film, raptors and the new and overrated Spinosaur.  The raptors are our old arch enemies that we loath and admire at the same time.  We hate them because of their belief that killing everything that isn't them is what is to be done, but we admire them in this movie for there cunning and their ability to communicate with eachother.
We are rushed into the film and the killing almost immediatelly.  Allen Grant is rushed into the new island with dinosaurs, supposedely there just wasn't enough running around loose already.  Stupidity is what this film is about.  First of all, these new people think they can control these dinosaurs (did they not watch the first two episisodes?)  Also, the cages they build are severely inadequate, which leaves you wandering who built them, and what material they were made of.  For some reason this movie decided not to answer our many questions, as to why they put these dinosaurs on a new island, and if the 100 people who died before both innocent and not did not persaude them to think twice before they bred and brought to life new dinosaurs that we were missing in the past.  There are so many questions that are left unanswered that this maximum of 1,000 words just wouldn't do.
Seven people die in the first 30 minutes, and then no one else dies.  I guess they just didn't have room or the time to let the other actors in on it.  The action scenes are quite memorable and the raptors are a lot more forgiving than before.  They tried to splay some comedy here and there, which made the movie a bit more cheesier.  Overall, this movie is worth the 2,4, or 6 dollars whichever you have to pay.  I guess it's worth it for you to get the closure.  They had to end it somehow, and like Scream 3, I think it ended in a bust.  If action is what you are seeking, then here is your movie, but if you are looking for a good plot and story line, I suggest you find another movie, maybe longer than an hour and a half.  Kudos to Jurassic Park 1, we will always remember it.

Oh yes I forgot, there are thousands of man-eating dinosaurs in that jungle, but go we shall because we are in search of some ticket profit.

But no, people in this movie seem to be absolute morons. Well they'd have to be in order for the movie studio to churn out not one sequel but two. And the funniest part is I remember watching a trailer on TV where they mention how there are new dinosaurs in this one. Oh whooppee. Another Godzilla-type monster which gores people. Yay. This movie was a complete waste of time. I give it two stars, because, hey, the effects were good. I mean a movie's no fun if you don't really think a person's being chewed by a dinosaur, is it?

It's all technical, which is at the essence of all these films.  It's nice to see Sam Neil and Laura Dern back but Allesandro Nivola and Tia Leone also make a big impression here.

1298219,3,B00003CXXR,"Most people watched this movie for its special effects, but I actually like the story line of the Jurassic Park series. I was disappointed because the movie has a load of potentials that could have been developed and stretched out to make the movie a much more complete plot and more satisfying experience, but they weren't. The movie also lacks a high climax, or memorable scenes in the previous two series (such as the T-Rex banging the jeep in the first one, and the two T-Rex with the bus in the second). Not only was the ending confusing and disappointing, the over-all plot contradicts itself and has many holes. The first two movies have a lot of scenes where it places the audience in the character's seat, and we sweat and get nervous about whether or not the characters in the movie are going to make it out alive. I did not find such intense moments in Jurassic Park III, and if there was one, it was weak.
The special effects are good, and if that's what you care about, you won't be disappointed with all the special effects in this movie. But if you actually care about a plot, or you crave those excitement and intense scenes, then you will be a bit disappointed (but go to theater for the great sound system anyway, it will only be worse when you rent it on video and watch it at home).",995932800,2,1302,4.406639004149378

Very disappointing. However, the action sequences were pretty good, and very scary. A word to the wise: stick with the first two flicks.",995932800,,433,4.6103896103896105
1298221,3,B00003CXXR,"When you go into the theatre to see this movie, you need to keep in mind 2 things:
1. This movie was NOT directed by Steven Spielberg. 2. This movie was NOT based on any Michael Chricton book.
With those factors in the equation, anyone who has read both books and seen both movies (like myself) would be quite skeptical of what is essentially just a hollywood creation to make more money, since there is nothing really artistic to build off of. And it truly shows in this movie. As I watched the movie, I thought back to the original Jurassic Park, which had the original great cast of Laura Dern, Sam Neill (both are in the 3rd one also) and Jeff Goldblum. Unlike the original, this movie does not have much of a deep plot, the ""mysteries"" of how the dinosaurs do things is nearly all gone, since most of that has been revealed in JP 1 and 2, and the whole subplot question of ""chaos"" and ""are we man or God?"" are completely non-existant in this movie.
Well then, you may be thinking, ""Why this did guy give this movie 3 stars?"" Well, overall, in and of itself, this isn't that bad of a movie. It is very short, and not just by JP Standards either. The action in the movie is quite good and keeps you wanting more and more. You also aren't waiting and waiting for the dinosaurs to start eating people either (they appear within the first 20 minutes of the movie.)
In terms of how this movie compares to the other 2, it doesn't even hold a candle to the splendor of the original movie. As compared to the second one, it's a rather tough call, as the second one would have been ok if it wasn't for the T-Rex ravaging through San Diego (Something that did NOT occur in the original book.) I think I'd rather watch this one again instead of the Lost World if I had the choice.
I'm not sure if it's worth spending $13 on this movie ($8+ for the ticket and then the extra for food) in the theatres. It may behoove you to wait until this one comes out for home viewing, especially for those of you with sweet DVD home systems.

1298223,3,B00003CXXR,"I had pretty low expectations going in for Jurassic Park III and for the most part they were pretty closely met. The film has a very thin plot, no character development, and absolutely no ""magic"". In the first Jurassic Park movie, I really enjoyed the feelings of wonder and discovery. Sure the dino-chase scenes were cool, but only as an adjunct to the voyage through the world of the dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park III all we get are chase scenes and instead of wonder and discovery we get one big monster movie.
But really, there's nothing wrong with a monster movie. And on that level there are some pretty interesting monsters in Jurassic Park III who look pretty good on screen. The action is non-stop, and happily the characters don't repeatedly comment on their grave situation (as they did over and over in The Lost World: Jurassic Park II). Unfortunately, there really isn't a climax in Jurassic Park III - no final battle or triumph, something truly essential to a good monster movie.
It's hard to come out of Jurassic Park III and recommend the film. Clocking just over 90 min., Jurassic Park III ends up being one big, short-feeling, monster movie without a pay off.",995932800,,1176,4.713592233009709

I like the dinosaus the best in this one, because of how real they look. The only bad thing about the dinos is that they only have the T-rex in one scene. The other thing is how short it is. I think it was way to short, I mean the other two were at least 2 hours and this one is 97 minutes. I really like how they use the petradons,they are so cool. The velociraptors are still my favorites though. I love how they added all this almost human communication to the raptors. The T-rex is feircly underusded and about as bad as a brachiasaur compared to the spinosaurus. They only brought Ellie in for a grand total of about 10 minutes but they did give Allen a good reprising role. They could have told what happened to Lex, Tim,and Hammond but I guess they didn't want to. They should have brought back allen or Ellie in the Lost World and it would have been better.

Nothing beats the first movie.
Let's face it, a sequel off of a sequel is a recipe for disappointment! JP III is not as bad as Lost World, but it's so close they might as well be considered equal. The ending was predictable within the first 15 minutes of the film.

The plot is a little thin, how 14 year old Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan's first stint with dinosaurs was Barney's Great Adventure), could survive 2 months alone on an island of man eaters is a mystery , but the dinosaurs are phenomenal. The computer generated or mechanical creatures are so life-like,(although one of the dino fight scenes looks like a remake of something out of One Million, B.C.), you can almost buy into the illusion that they are real.

1298269,3,B00003CXXR,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, it was dark and violent and set up just how it was the dinosaurs were created.  The second one didn't know quite what it was supposed to be: it had some dark parts, some violent parts and then some absolutely dumb and silly parts (the entire San Diego sequence.)  The one thing that the first two movies had that this one didn't was the feeling of an event movie.  JP3, take away the outstanding visual effects, had the feel of a backyard movie gone horribly wrong, not an event film.
Alan Grant (Neill) gets propositioned basically in the exact same way by Paul Kirby (Macy) that John Hammond did in the first one.  Grant's research team in Montana is running low on funding, on the verge of termination when the mysterious benefactor comes along asking for a tour of the island and in return the team will be funded indefinitely.  So Grant goes, not realizing just exactly what he's being asked to do, and then havoc erupts.
The rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape the island alive ... and so on and so forth.  And like The Lost World, a team member takes something that the dinosaurs want back ...
The entire movie is formulaic, digging up horror, thriller and action cliches backed with impressive effects, but little else.  And like The Lost World, the ending is a little bit silly as well.
I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I've enjoyed the Jurassic Park franchise in both film and novel form. Maybe this film could have been saved if Spielberg himself directed.

1298272,4,B00003CXXR,"THE LOST WORLD was a bad book and an only slightly better movie.  Crichton was writing a tie-in book for a movie that hadn't been made yet (when he wrote JURASSIC PARK, he probably didn't think his vision could convincingly be put to film.  Spielberg's faults, which usually don't include making uninteresting movies, was at his dullest with THE LOST WORLD.  So it was perhaps for the better that both usually capable storytellers abandoned JURASSIC PARK III, which turned out just fine.
If the original JURASSIC PARK was FRANKENSTEIN for a more modern age, this one is PETER PAN (which is borrowed from extensively).  The message is that if you approach this movie as a boy who never grew up, you will like it.  It has nifty special effects, monsters chasing screaming people, and a fast, fast pace.  (THE LOST WORLD has a literary antecedent, too - Arthur Conan Doyle's book by the same name.  What the message was supposed to be is beyond me).  The movie moves so fast that it seems too short - the ending just sneaks up and is somewhat unsatisfying.
Other low points?  The dialogue is bad.  The plot is silly.  The featured role, yet again, of a child is annoying.  And the featured creature - the ""spinosaurus,"" while based on a real fossil (that was destroyed in World War II) looks fake.  Part of what makes Jurassic Park work is that the dinosaurs are so realistic that their very images evoke wonder about what they were really like.  The spinosaurus doesn't work both because it looks unreal, and nobody ever heard of it even if a fossil did exist once.  But then you get beyond that when it battles a T-Rex and then its back to being a boy who never grew up.  Little boys don't care about any of those things.  Except the part about it being too short.

And I was not dissapointed.  This is an action packed film from beginning to end, and is very entertaining.
This movie does however, suffer from two major flaws, and one minor flaw.  The first and biggest flaw is that this movie does not feature much of a story.  The only real intriguing thing to the story is that we have now discovered that the raptors can communicate vocaly.  The other major flaw is that this movie is just too short to be a Jurassic Park film.  Instead of the two hour long movie we have grown accustomed to, we get a movie that just barely clocks in over ninety minutes, which gives this a kind of rushed feeling.
The minor flaw, the humor.  This is a Jurassic Park film, humor and Alan Grant do not mix.  That is why you put Ian Malcolm into the movie,(who does not appear in this film, but is mentioned) to create humorous situations, Alan is meant to be the dark serious character.  This leads to many jokes where you find yourself sitting there not laughing wondering why the people around you are even chuckling.  The largest problem with the humor is that, it is things which have been done in many other films and just aren't executed well here.
This is the second best in the series(they don't even come close to the first one, the only one with an intriguing story).  And while I recommend this movie, I first recommend that you take your thinking caps off before stepping into the theater.",995846400,,1617,4.5034246575342465

The story and movie seemed ""thrown together"" to make a quick buck. The film also appeared ""dark"" to me, e.g., fuzzy outlines of images and it had that ""cheesecloth over the lens"" look about it. The story line was completely unbelievable to me. It was almost like a serial movie reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Action, action, action with little character development and very little believability. Sam Neill seemed like he was ""tired, but show me the money and I'll do it again."" I wish Laura Dern had had a bigger role. The little kid I didn't care for at all. Obnoxious. No empathy. Overall, I enjoyed the dinosaur sequences, but the film was too short, and the ending was quite unbelievable to me as well. Oh well...it's hard to top the first JP, and sequels are never as good as the originals (most of the time, anyway). The producers could have done much more with this film than they did, in my opinion.",995846400,,1029,4.5675675675675675

1298299,5,B00003CXXR,This movie is the BEST yet! I could not wait for it to be released. ALL of my freinds and I watch it the first day. It is better than the second one most definetly (when hey took the T-rex to Los Angeles or New York [i cant remember]well that was stupid) As far as the raptors are concerned it wasn't better than the kitchen scene in the first. If the Velociraptors didn't set traps it would have been boring. In the first raptor part when they were in the building looking at the unfinished dinosaurs and the woman looks into the tube and sees a raptor she thinks it is inside but it blinks and jumps out at her I knew that was coming but it still scared the [...] out of me. Why the raptors ran away once they got their eggs I don't know. was it because of the noise Alan made or because they heard the helicopters. the real raptors would have ripped them to pieces. Spinosaurus was great but I don't like how he killed the T-rex in 30 seconds. Pteradactals were great too. in the end the pteradactals flew away from the island. this may possibly set up JP4(i hope).

Its rare to find sequels getting good word of mouth from top critics. I must say I thouroughly enjoyed the film. Its a masterpiece compared to The Lost World, but not as good as the original adventure. JPIII is dark, funny, and best of all, short. Had the films running time been any longer than 10 minutes, it probably wouldn't have been as good. But its brilliant the way it is. Its just action and adventure all the way with each set piece getting more and more bigger and better. All the sequences with the Spinosauraus are wonderful, especially the boat attack and fight with the T-rex, and as for the familiar Raptor scenes, these are all given a new and impressive light concentrating more on there intelligence and social behaviors. JPIII is a worthy addition to the Jurassic Park franchise, but I'm not sure if the studios will be able to take it further. But I would recommend this to anyone. For pure fantasy JPIII has some of the best visual effects I've seen since The Matrix, and its worth watching just for that.",995846400,,1213,4.54337899543379

1298302,4,B00003CXXR,"Summed up, this third installment of the Jurassic Park franchise was a solid installment in the series.  It still contains all the blood-curdling thrills that made the first such a humongous hit.  Tons of suspense and ""holy BLEEP"" moments in this one.  Overall, it's a great way to kill a few hours.
If you're squeamish do be aware that a few sick and gross moments are in the film.
The basic plotline has our hero Dr. Grant returning to the island of dinosaurs after being conned into a rescue mission for the son of a couple after a parasailing accident.  In all the story makes for some great ""tender family moments"" and tons of suspense and action as our heroes battle (or more like RUN and HIDE) from the monstrous predators.
Cool stuff: the revelation of the Raptors intelligence (really spooky to think if this were true and they still were around), the Pterodactyls and the brawl between these two T-Rexs
Not so cool stuff:  the very abrupt ending to the movie that just screams, ""Okay, that's enough, let's wrap it up here.""
Overall though, it's a great flick to kill a few hours.  Other than the ending, you'll come away with a ""this one's pretty cool"" feeling at the end.  It's not as good as the first, but better than part two.

One that stands out the most would be the final rescue scene in which a man stands on the beach with a mega-phone and calls out to the group as they exit the forest onto the beach, ""Dr. Grant!"", as if some other group of people just happened to be on this island too. The only thing that would have been worse, would have been if the guy was holding a sign that read ""Grant Party"". Sure it's believable that they make a satelite phone call, only to get disconnected, and Dern dials *69 to call them back, and she's able to figure out their location from Dr. Grant yelling ""We're in the river."" She gets the Army, Navy and the Marines to come rescue them in less than 45 minutes out in the middle of nowhere. I don't think so.

I was so excited about this movie coming out because I loved the first two.  I noticed that Steven Spielberg didn't direct this and I was wondering about how good this movie would be, so I decided to give it a try.
This is a horrible movie in plot and concept.  This movie is also a waste of talent.  William H. Macy, one of my favorite actors, is the only thing that gives the acting sort of a boost.  Most of the characters were very dry, including Sam Neill, who was so great in the first one.  I wish that the little boy got eaten by a dinosaur.  He was sooooo annoying.  The problem with this movie was that every line had to be funny.  The screenwriter probably spent so much time trying to be funny, it turned out not to be.
Like I said, the only good thing in this movie is the effects, though cheesy, they are sometimes breathtaking.
All in all, this movie was horrible and very disappointing.  Do you want to know why?  It wasn't directed by Steven Spielberg.",995760000,,1084,4.203883495145631

1298356,4,B00003CXXR,"All right, so the script isn't eclectic, and the storyline isn't exactly unpredictable. Nobody goes to see a Jurassic Park movie for those elements -- face it, everyone wants to see the DINOSAURS. And if this movie does anything well, it's in the dino-delivery. The dinosaurs are bigger and smarter -- and, surprisingly, apparently less hungry. Out of all the Jurassic films, fewer people get chomped in this one (perhaps that's because there are fewer main characters?). Still, the script manages to convey a dark humour, and there are a few witty wisecracks.
The cinematography is fantastic, and the special effects engrossing. A few shots, like the one with the embryos in the 'production room', are simply ethereal. All in all, while it's certainly no brain-bending piece of thoughtful rhetoric, JPark III delivers well what we want most: MORE DINOSAURS!

In once scene, Grant says that their is ""nothing in heaven or earth."" that would get him to go back to the island, but not 5 minutes later he's on his way.
I'm not going to give away any of the ""plot"" but be assured that you'll leave scratching your head.  This movie should not have been made.  If the was no good story to tell, then they should have let the Jurrasic Park series die without it being tainted with this!",995760000,2,687,4.104477611940299
1298360,4,B00003CXXR,"I felt that this sequel was an apology for The Lost World.  Michael Crichton wrote an unbelievably great sequel to Jurassic Park, Spielberg took it, slapped Crichton in the face with it, and then threw it away.  C'mon . . . the last scenes of JP2 were possibly the cheesy I have ever seen (the Godzilla comparison with Japanese running down the street yelling stuff, the T-Rex loose in San Diego)
Nevertheless, I liked JP3. It was a return to the thrill-ride intensity of JP1. Maybe it was having Sam Neill back that made it better.  The special effects were, once again, great.  The jungle fight between the T-Rex and the new monster, spinosaurus, were too real-looking to think they were computer-generated.  Sam Winston, once again, did a superb job with the velociraptors.
The story line was admirable but left a few holes. I was shocked that the movie was so short. However, it was a pleasant length.  Although, it was funny walking out hearing a fellow movie goer ask if it was intermission.
I don't understand why this movie was rated PG-13 unless it was for violence and scary intensity.  There were very few profanities that I can recall.  And, I don't like the evolutionary message it sent - I am a Creationist.  (Please, velociraptors would never have taken over the world.  They didn't the first time.) However, I have come to accept that Hollywood will never embrace Scripture, no matter how true it is.

It did for some parts, but the movie didn't have the same feeling. This movie was targeted for younger viewers compared to the first two, which were targeted for teens and adults. Reasons why it didn't live up to its reputation:
1. Usually at the beginning of the JP movies, they would show someone getting attacked or eatened. Well, they didn't actually SHOW it in this movie.
2. The movie didn't show anyone actually getting eaten, besides the quick grab by the Spinosaurus. There was no ripping in half or crunch time.
3. Out of the people (the ones searching for the boy) who went onto the island, only three people got killed. Compared to the other movies, this kill count is a small fraction.
4. The scenes/camera moved to fast to catch a real good look at the dinos.
5. I didn't see any blood besides coming from the cuts from the people and the plane slamming into the dino.
5. Isn't at least two hours long
These reasons should be sufficient enough. The reasons why JP3 was equal to the other two were:
1. The dinos, to me, looked the same (same effects)
2. Uh, I guess leaving in a chopter at the end.
3. Introduces new dinos (Spinosaurus and a couple of others)

1298424,5,B00003CXXR,"I have been holding off writing my 50th review because I wanted it to be on something big and special. I'm glad I waited. After hitting all the JP3 sites for nearly a year now, waiting for the final day when we here those fated words, ""Now Playing At A Theatre Near You."" I couldn't sleap the other night! Waiting for my family, I had to pospone my trip to the cinema for two days. Well, after all the wait, and the sleepless night here is my review on something Big and Special:
 Welcome to Jurassic Park, for the third time. By comparison it isn't as good as the first, but was better than the second (The Lost World, for those of you who don't know by now.) For the past few days I have had the opportunity to be around theatres, to see the reaction to the third. 19 mil$ in the first day, thats the original fact I learned when I bought my ticket. I saw the wide-eyed and happy expressions of those leaving the theatre in front of me. They were clawing and making jurassic-motions, if you get the meaning. They looked a little goofy, but they didn't care because they seemed too impressed to care. Today I was close to a theater slam full of lines, I must have heard the words, ""Jurassic"" and ""Park"" and ""3"" and ""Awesome"" a thousand times. (Are they connected? We may never know...) I myself think that a new level was reached for the Jurassic enterprise, and even though I thought I was Jurassic-immune from watching the original about...well I lost count around 63...times. And the Lost World 40+ times. But Friday afternoon proved one thing, the Jurassic series still leaves me grinning cheesily. Maybe I like jumping and yelling ""Bite him!"" Or maybe I fell in love with the characters. ....As I surrendered my imaginaton to Jurassic Park 3, I realized that it wasn't necessary because it was holding my mind on its own. Things happen so smoothly and so quickly that you don't have time to stop and smell the dino-droppings. (Gross, yeah I know).
 If you have never watched the two films before this one don't let that stop you! This story stands on its own. The time is not too long, not too short (I am going to pay for that remark), and gives you just enough to smile when you see the credits.
(To Universal, and all involved. Congrats. ....UPDATE! I have now seen it twice! Its still great! Going to see it again on the 30th with some friends. We'll see if the 3rd time breaks my hype.) (Update (Aug 1st) Nope, the third time didn't break it. It is still great. What are you doing reading this long review! I have already seen it three times! You should be at the theater right now!)",995673600,10,2594,4.390852390852391

I WOULD recommend this movie for a theatre-viewing to enjoy the effects (even though they aren't as good as the first and second movie) but make sure you bring along earplugs and a good imagination.",995673600,,369,4.545454545454546
1298426,4,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park was great. The Lost World was mediocre, but fun to watch. Jurassic Park III is a surprisingly enjoyable blend of its two predecessors. It combines everything that made the first film great with everything that made the second film ...entertaining. You get amazing atmosphere and subtle, eerie effects, while at the same time, being blown away by very blunt and in-your-face shock-horror. They mix to make for a very suspensful and scary summer thrill ride.
I think the best thing about it is the variety it offers. Unlike The Lost World, whose action was practically identical to the original film, it offers new and exciting hazards for the cast to overcome. In the first two films, there were only two main threats, the Tyrannasaurus Rex and the Velociraptors. However, in JP3, the T-Rex is almost completely absent (he makes a pleasing cameo early in the movie), and a great twist is added to the Raptors. Also, two new dinosaurs are thrown into the characters' faces, the Spinosaurus (who even the T-Rex fears) and the Pteradon, a flying dinosaur.
However, like all films, JP3 has its flaws. These flaws include an almost entirely unbelievable ending, which in my opinion, came too soon; the movie ended before things had a chance to wrap up.  The ending was mediocre at best, unlike the first, and even the second film.  ....Unfortunately, JP3's ending is no where near as memorable.
It won't win the Oscar for best picture, but when you get down to it, good acting, great special effects, a decent script, and amazing action make this one of the best summer popcorn movies in years.",995673600,23,1602,4.843065693430657
1298427,4,B00003CXXR,"Jurassic Park had a story, great cast, likable characters, and terrific dinosaurs. The Lost World had a little bit of story, an ""okay"" cast, some annoying but still manageable characters (Dude, that baby T-Rex really got on my nerves at times), and the same old dinosaurs save for those little green guys. Both had great dino attacks and action sequences.
 Jurassic Park 3 does away with the story element ...and hits it big with the dinosaurs and action sequences. During the first 15 minutes or so of the movie, we see the reason there would be a return to the dreaded island o' dinos. We're also reintroduced to Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), our heroes from the first film. Although Laura Dern's appearance is only a cameo, it was great to see how her character and Sam Neill's character has evolved relationship-wise. After that, Grant is approached to give a couple (Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) an air-tour of the dreaded island. ....After they make the mistake of landing, the action begins. We're quickly introduced to the new dino in town, the Spinosaurus. And he makes quiet an entrance. After that, it's all about running and guess -- or knowing -- who's going to meet their death at the jaws and claws of a dino.
 The whole idea of the movie was to focus on the dinosaurs. JP3 was all about the dinosaurs. And we get magnificent views of them too. And not to mention a battle between the shortly seen T-Rex and the Spinosaurus. And a magnificent and truly thrilling action sequence with the pterodactyls.

1298429,3,B00003CXXR,"Let's not mince around here. 'JPIII' is *not* on cinema level with the first movie - not even close. But it is a sequel, not only that, but a *second* sequel, so what should one really expect by now? What 'JPIII' *is*, is a great, edge-of-your-seat ride of a B-movie monster flick.
  The only returning character from the other films is Sam Neill, as Dr. Grant. Laura Dern (from the first film) makes a small cameo, but that's only at the beginning. Grant is still digging up fossils, but times are hard, and his research project needs money. A possible light at the end of the tunnel appears when a couple (played by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) approach him, offering him a blank check if he takes them on an ""airborne"" guided tour of the Jurassic Park island. He agrees, but it soon becomes clear that the couple are not as forthcoming as they had once seemed. Instead of merely being thrill-seekers, as they had claimed, they are intent on landing on the island in order to find their lost boy, who was (rather stupidly) skydiving over the island when he suddenly went missing.
  The plane, of course, crashes, and secondary characters quickly get gobbled up. What I liked about *this* particular 'Jurassic Park', was that it was very brutal. Many of the attack scenes in this picture make the part from the first film where the two kids are trapped in the van and the T-Rex is after them look positively tame. I'm not altogether sure 'JPIII' is completely factual in terms of what dinosaurs were actually capable of doing, but this is a fantasy movie, so why bother? Here the monsters can think, verbally communicate, set traps, and follow their prey over long distances. The scenes where they appear are fast, graphic, and very intense. The raptors play a large role in the film, as does another dinosaur (bigger and badder than the T-Rex) named Spinosaurus.
  Most of this movie is nothing more than the main characters being chased by big, ugly, mean dinosaurs - but that is what makes it good. So many of the scenes are dripping with horror and suspense, that you really feel as though you are trapped on the island with them. Sometimes, the encounters with the monsters even borders on the terrifying. True, there are some things thrown in for ... ""shock value"", but the thing that you must realize about this film, is that it is a second sequel to a highly successful movie, and this time, the gloves are off. The characters are less real than ever (if that can be believed), but the dinosaurs are definitely badder. If there is one qualm I have with the movie, it is the ending. It ended ""not with a bang, but with a whimper"".
  'Jurassic Park III' is an all-out thrash & bash monster B-movie. Don't go into it expecting anything more than that. It did it's job well in that endeavor, and for that I was pleased. It is a pale shadow of the first film, however, and I hardly see how a *fourth* entry into the series can be done, unless they have it take place on the mainland, which sounds a bit silly. Just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is - a 90-min. thrill ride on Dinosaur island.",995673600,,3109,4.490265486725663

Just like when a cute or handsome guy brings a woman to a boil and just when she is ready to fall he grins and all his front teeth are missing--JURASSIC II is disappointing.  This was intended to be a 10 even 15 movie but it ends up between 3 or 4 because somebody dropped the ball.  It certainly wasn't the Special Effects techs.  THEY DID THEIR JOB.  But let's throw tomatoes at the script writers.
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  One reviewer said, ""real monsters, real people.""  Well right, but who wants drappy, drippy, huggy-wuggy people in the middle of a great monster movie?  Who?  I'm sour and so disappointed; frustratingly so.
I'M WILLING TO BET this movie does not make the half-billion to one billion it would have made with a more mature script; with some characters more mature, less suburbian, less stupid.  I thought the son was much more mature than his parents.  He really added to the movie.  I think instead of his parents I would have preferred him knowing more and doing more with the monsters to get the upperhand.  But his parents worked on my last nerve.  One hug was enough but they did twenty.  I don't want them in my monster movie, okay!  They frustrated me so.
If only, the characters were more mature and interesting I could have had a complete experience in my seat.  I could have had that great ride in the park.
I'll be watching the numbers.  We'll see what the people say; if they say the same as me.  I'm predicting about 200-300 million worldwide for the special effects only.  Just the special effects.
THANK YOU EFFECTS PEOPLE--GREAT JOB.  YOU DID NOT DISAPPOINT.  BUT CHECK OUT THE SCRIPT WRITERS NEXT TIME.

Well, what I got was snippets of thrill, one motherly character that overdid her role in an extremely cheesy manner, and an entire movie leaving me hanging on for more. The end...well, that was one big abrupt stop sign.  When the clock struck 90 minutes, did a bell go off to tell the writers ""your time is up, lay your pencils down, now???!""  I sat and hesitated for a minute wondering where was the rest of the movie and where was the rest of the plot.  By far, the pteradactyl scenes were the best, following the realization of the actors that they were in a giant, rotted bird cage.  What a nice, twisted shock to me that this little bit of info, the existence of such magnificent creatures, had not previously been divulged!  Nice touch!  The spino was an ""enormous"" addition as well, but we should have seen more of him and more interaction with him.  I am now waiting on the video.

1298432,4,B00003CXXR,"This movie does a good job of doing exactly what it wants to do. ""Jurassic Park III"" is not as awe-inspiring as the first film or as elaborate as the second, but in its own B-movie way it's a nice little thrill machine. One of its charms is its length--less than 90 minutes, if you don't count the end credits. Like the second half of a double bill in the 1940s, it doesn't overstay its welcome. One of the ways it saves time is by stunningly perfunctory character development. There's hardly a line of dialog that doesn't directly serve the plot in one way or another. Even Sam Neill's pontifications about those who would trifle with the mystery of life are in the movie only as punctuation, to separate the action scenes. In a summer when B-movie ideas like have been blown up to gargantuan size and length with A-movie budgets, here is an action picture we actually wish was a little longer. Part of its brevity is explained by the abrupt ending.... Trained by the interior tides and rhythms of most action movies, we're blindsided by the ending, which comes when we expect the false crisis, followed by the false dawn, and then the real crisis and the real dawn. We can't believe the movie is really over, and when some flying Pteranodons appear, we expect another action scene, but no--they're just flapping their way overseas to set up the next sequel.  The movie begins with a 14-year old named Eric (Trevor Morgan) parasailing with his mother's boyfriend over the forbidden island of Isla Sorna, off the coast of Costa Rica. You will recall that this is the location of the doomed theme park in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park II."" The tow boat disappears into a mist of fog and emerges sans crew, and the parasailers crash on the island. Cut to America, where the boy's divorced parents (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) offer ... but the movie is ingenious in devising ways for prehistoric beasts to attack. There are some truly effective action sequences--one involving flying lizards and a suspension bridge, another involving an emergency rescue with the recycled parasail--that are as good as these things get.  I also liked the humor that's jimmied into the crevices of the plot. There are two nice gags involving the ringer on a cell phone, and a priceless exchange of dialog between the 14-year-old and the expert paleontologist... ....I am aware that ""Jurassic Park III"" is shorter, cheaper and with fewer pretensions than its predecessors, and yet there was nothing I disliked about it, and a lot of admire in its lean, efficient story telling. I can't praise it for its art, but I must not neglect its craft, and on that basis I recommend it.

1298473,3,B00003CXXR,"You might remember Dr. Grant from the first Jurassic Park movie, while looking for additional fund for his research, he decided to give an aerial tour of the Isla Sorna near Costa Rica to Paul and Amanda Kirby.  When their plane crashes on the island, Dr. Grant again finds himself in the midst of hostile dinosaurs, trying to stay alive.
Seeing dinosaurs in action again still give me the goosebumps, but a lot of scenes in Jurassic Park 3 just doesn't hold the same thrills as the first movie, rather, a feeling of been there and done that.  The movie itself looks great, excellent visuals and great looking cinematography, but the rest held little surprises.  The only other positive thing about the film are the characters, this time there is a real and believable reason for them to be risking their lives, although some more reluctantly than others.  Sam Neil reprises his role as Dr. Alan Grant, a man whose love for dinosaurs has been tainted by his near death experience at the Jurassic Park.  William H. Macy and Tea Leoni plays the Kirbys, their relationship and intention for visiting the island is not what it seems.
Jurassic Park 3 is definitely 92 minutes of non-stop action, I didn't find any places that dragged on, and it is still as violent as ever.  I'd recommend not to get your expectations too high, although it isn't as scary, the blood and gore might not be suitable for the younger children.",995587200,4,1417,4.670682730923695
1298474,5,B00003CXXR,"Well, besides the first one.  Jurassic Park 3 is one of the rare sequel to films that actually lives up tothe original.  A sequel either has to be just as good, or better than the original.  After lost world was a waste of time, Spielburg stepped down from the jp chair, and handed it to director Joe Jonhston (Honey, I shrunk the kids and October Sky).  I was extremely excited for th new JP film to be released, because I'm such a big fan, since the original.  I saw it on the opening day, July 18, 2001.  I walked in excited..came out with a smile on my face.  It was sooo good, I want to see it again.
The story is very good and original: Isla Sorna, the island from lost world, is now RESTRICTED from any human being (which I love at the beginning when it says in big, red letters) after the annoying scene from TLW with the T-rex romping through San Diego.  But pleanty of idiotic tourists like to bask near shore of the island, including one para sailing crew, that decides to para sail near the island...big mistake.  The boat is found torn apart and the two hang gliders, are shipped to shore on the island.  The film then jumps to a house with a kid playing with toy dinos. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill, reprising his role from the first film) is visting his old college and friend, Elle Saddler (Lara Dern, also reprising her role), in her happy, married life (too bad.  I was hoping the two would be the married ones).  Grant is struggling to get funds for his paleotolinest dig, but isn't getting any because ""the inncident"" on the park doesn't help reseach...despite the fact that John Hammond (Richard Attenbourgh, and no,he doesn't appear in the film, for some reason) resent death doesn't give any will to Alan, espeaically since he prommised to give Alan a raise in the first film.  But then, a billionare Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) asks Alan to be his tour guide for him and his wife, Amanda (Tea Leoni) to fly over isla Sorna. Alan agrees, because Paul, in favor for the guide, will give as much as Grant wants to his reaseach: money.  Alan takes his trusty assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola) with him for the ride, while the Kirby's take several shady charecters (of them is Micheal Jeter and John Diehl).  But things start to get rough when they get there: Paul then tells Alan that they will land.  Alan then goes furious, knowing that the island is way too dangerous, and refuses to land.  It doesn't matter...minutes later, they land and are forced to take off again, being attack by some type of dino.  The strange dino kills one of them at first, then destroys the plane, with them inside.  Now they are stranded on the island. The Kirbys thn explain that their son is on the island, because the para sailing inncident earlier. The dino that chased them earlier is called a ""Spinosaurus"" a larger dino than a Tyranosaur.  Plus, even more danger is brought when the team discovers that the band of Raptors on the island can communicate with other dinos and are very intelligant.  Evolution is Adventure.
JP3 is a definate blockbuster for the summer.  With a solid cast, unbelieveable special effects and good plot and story to it, it's definately a movie that will please both types of crowds.  A must see.  Spetacular.  Genius.  Brilliant.  And just plain...Fun.  Two thumbs up.",995587200,,3305,4.54653130287648
1298475,4,B00003CXXR,"Okay, I loved the first one and hated the second one (there is just so much chaos a person can take). The third one is simpler, less characterization, less dialog, much cooler dinos. Special effects are great, the lizards are great, and lets face it, has anyone EVER seen William H Macy do ANYTHING bad? I sure haven't! To me, if the WH Macy choses to make a movie, my money is on it. The casting was believable (I was glad to see Grant back), there was a little comic relief, plenty of action, and my only complaint is that the human body is designed to SIT IN THE THEATER for a little over 100 minutes, so the end comes too quickly at 97 minutes.
That is my two cents.",995587200,,670,4.161538461538462
1298476,5,B00003CXXR,"I saw this movie opening night and it was awesome. I'm glad that Sam Neill is back as Dr. Alan Grant. He's my favorite character in the movie. They go to Isla Sorna to guide a married couple for their anniversary. While they are there, they also look for their son. This one was much better than the 1st and 2nd ones put together. I saw this movie the next day for a 2nd time because it was so good. Jurassic Park 3 is a must see.",995587200,,430,3.954022988505747
1298477,2,B00003CXXR,"I was hesitant to see Jurassic Park III, not because of the exorbitant price charged to see any movie nowadays (although that is scarier than any movie I've seen - $9 a ticket).  But because a sequel is hardly ever as good as the original.  This one did not disappoint me.  The special effects (yawn) were fabulous, but were more impressive in JP1, or even JP2.  The shots just looked rushed and stiffer.  The science behind the fiction was passable until the Pteranadon scenes.  Flying creatures have to be extremely light.  The Pteranadon fossils all point to hollow bones and light bodies.  Why then do the Pteradactyls make a BOOM like a T-Rex when they walk on the broken bridge?  Why do they look like they weigh at least 500 lbs?  Bad science in the science fiction.
Let me qualify the comment about the special effects: If any of the JP movies were to be taken individually for their effects then I would not yawn about them.  After two JP movies there is nothing particularly ""special"" about these same effects in a third movie.  Either develop a really solid story line with more meat (no pun intended) or really surprise us with something different in the FX department.  I actually enjoyed the previews for Monster, Inc more than the JP3 effects.
The acting and story line were predictable - people go to dangerous island against any intelligent thought or government wishes.  They do not listen to any warnings about how to behave, even after being almost eaten within 15 minutes of landing.  Someone wanders away from the others (what a surprise there) and gets into trouble.  The only armed people are eaten within 30 minutes or so of the landing.  No one thinks to pick up even a sharp stick to use as a spear.  Predictable, predictable, predictable.
I think Sam Neill is a heck of a fine actor as are the rest of the star cast.  Why then do I wish the dinosaurs had eaten them all?  My suggestion is: see this at a matinee.  It should be seen on a big screen, but not for $9 a pop.  It just isn't that great compared to what it had to live up to.",995587200,,2063,4.459893048128342
1298478,1,B00003CXXR,"While I will always be a dedicated and loyal fan of the Jurassic movie series (the first one was fabulous and Lost World was twisty, strange but still commanding and worthy of appreciation), Jurassic Park III is a flat out dud.
The underlying plot material is unquestionably similar to the first two movies, the acting consistently flat, and the supporting cast immensely weak (for example, the notable absence of Jeff Goldblum in this third film makes you realize how essential his character and talent was in making a box office success of the two prior Jurassic films).
While Spielberg apparently had consulting roles in the construction of the film, it becomes abundantly clear even before the first 30 minutes of the film have been viewed that Spielberg was certainly NOT at the helm in Jurassic Park III.  The dialogue is rarely provoking and more often glib and nothing more than American soundbites of pop culture.  The sold-out movie theatre crowd with whom I watched the film appeared to agree with my growing dislike of the film -- the crowd rarely laughed, never applauded, and immediately scurried out like a pack of underfed bloodhounds upon the rolling of credits in the final, goofy scene.
In a word, Jurassic Park III is an enormous disappointment.  A film lacking in polish, character, and more importantly -- soul. One never feels any sort of emotional connection with the cast; even the young actor cast as the lost child on the dinasour island leaves you feeling ambiguous and disinterested in his eventual rescue.  And if one can believe it, even the dinasaur scenes seemed to lack the digital precision and realistic flavor that one may have grown accustomed to in the first two films.
Save your $8.50 and maybe you rent this one night when nothing is left at the local video store.  Three times is not a charm, at least not for Jurassic Park III.",995587200,6,1870,4.813084112149533

The dinosaurs look more real than they rver did.  Yes, a few parts in the movie were either boring/cheezey BUT ONLY A FEW!!  The director did pretty good besides making it an hour 1/2 when the others were 2 hours but o well.  i think u should go see this movie if you're a die hard action freak like me i love action/adventure so this movie is perfect and see it if you like Jurassic Park movies 1&2.

1298480,5,B00003CXXR,"I have just recently seen the new Jurassic Park movie and it was great. Although nothing can live up to the first film in the trilogy, Jurassic Park 3 is a close second. This film is far better than The Lost World (The second movie). And this time there's no annoying Jeff Goldblume in it. A big plus for most JP fans (I mean how much can you take of ""You two dig up-dig up di-dinosaurs?""). And a huge up for the film is that Sam Neil is back for the role of Dr. Alan Grant. Even Laura Dern (Dr. Elllie Sattler) has a cameo.
In Jurassic Park Three, Alan Grant and his student Billy are desperate for money for their new ideas on the intelligence of raptors and for their dig site in Montana. When it seems that they'll have to shut down for lack of money, wealthy Paul Kirby and his wife (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) tell Grant that if he goes with them to Isla Sorna (Site B) they will provide fundings for his dig. But once they reach the island, things take a turn for the worst. The team (Alan Grant, Billy, Paul Kirby and his wife, and several others) crash land their plane on the island and are faced with a danger they could never have imagined.
In my opinion, Jurassic Park 3 is a great movie. Also, this movie takes place four years after The Lost World, not before (Just thought I'd clear that up).",995587200,6,1312,4.189723320158103

Of course not!  Be honest now, you  did it for only one reason... to SEE THE DINOSAURS!  And boy, are they ever first class! They are worth the price of the movie, and you will leave the theater feeling that you did, in fact, get your money's worth.  The dinosaurs were, as expected, excellent and certainly state of the art.  If you want to see realistic looking dinosaurs making sounds that rattle the sub woofers in your local theater, then this is the film for you.  However, if you really do want the plot twists, etc., then I suggest that you rent Citizen Kane.",995587200,,761,4.431654676258993
1298482,1,B00003CXXR,"Ahh yes, the 3rd installment of the best-selling Michael Crichton novel.  As I and I hope may of you can tell this 3rd episode is not based on a novel written by him, more of a continuation of a profitable series by those in hollywood.  First off, the premise is weak.  They say that the island is some 200 miles off the Costa Rican coast, yet somehow a 15 ft fishing boat has made it out that far.  Second, I do (sort of) understand that they are wanting to be close so that they can see dinosaurs, not the MOST creative premise but hey whatever works right??  Second, why did they even include Laura Dern in the movie? I would guess that they did not have plans to, but when they did not know how to get them OFF the island in the end, that is when she came in to play.  And yet she does not even show up at the end.  Third, the final (battle) scene.  Who can forget JP1 when Grant and others are surrounded in the visitors center by 3 velociraptors when T-Rex comes and gobbles them away, allowing them to esacpe. Not to mention the magnificent plight of attempting to get away from the raptors that happened prior to this.  In the second, the T-Rex plowing through city streets looking for her baby.  In this installment, there is none.  Even the MAIN so called ""mean"" or ""main dinsaour"" that they keep running into has not a...[darn]thing to do with the ending.  What is that?? Not to spoil it but there wasn't even a final battle!!  Last but certainly not least, the side drama of the divorced parents coming together to find their son.  Their constant squabbles and annoyance only make you want the dinosaurs to kill them.  Or perhaps it was just me.  The only truely likeable charater was Grant (Grant's assistant could mabye be considered one also, however he commits treason but later is redeemed.)  The reason it did earn its one star for me was for good action sequences (expecailly the T-rex, Spinosaur battle) and some sporattic humor. Special effects were also a very big bright spot for this film, as can be vouched for by its past academy awards (the sequence of the baby Pranadons attacking Eric are fantastic).  In conclusion, if you must go see it do not expect much.  The action is good, as are the special effeects,  the cast is as well, things just did not come together as well as they should have.

JP3 starts out well enough, Grant is suckered into going on a rescue mission to Isla Sorna by a ""wealthy couple"" who miraculously manage to hire three expensive specialists to come because they own a small-town bathroom company and can no way pay Grant. After they land on the island, things start to go bad. Without ruining the already medicre plot, this movie is all about action, which sounds like a good idea but as JP2:LW proved, good ideas are usually met with poor execution by the filmwriters. The acting gets VERY cheesy through most of film, and the ending is laughable in its stupidity, which was the final nail in the coffin for this film.
The Jurassic Park series is definetly descending downward. JP1 was the best by far, then JP2 which, was lame but watchable, to this, which is just plain terrible.

The first thing I do (and reccomend you do) before i go to a sequel is to make sure I don't expect much from it, after all, many sequels have been hastily and sloppily done.  But there's just something about Jurassic Park that draws people to the theatres.  It's probably the most recent and realistic take on dinosaurs for any movie because the series shifts the style from godzilla style monsters destroying cities to basically wild animals from 65 million years ago.  So, about the movie.  I will admit, even though I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan, that the plot was a little sketchy so don't expect a dramatic story.  The ending is very sudden and that's one thing i didn't enjoy about it (the story could have easily gone on to meet 2 hours). But the effects are just stunning.  No recent ""dinosaur"" productions have ever captured the successes that the JP line has.  Expect dino-fights and some characters fighting as well.  If you loved the T-Rex is Jurassic Park and the Lost World, get ready to cry because it will be relinquishing the championship to the newcomer dinosaur, Spinosaurus.  There are also sme nasty airborne dinos, the Pteranadons, that act as some nasty pests to Grant and his buddies.  There were problems with this movie but I still liked it enough to give it 4 1/2 stars (since i can't pick that option on the rating) and my theatre actually started clapping at the end of the movie which movies seldom induce around here.  In short, if you enjoyed Jurassic Park 1 & 2, like non-stop action, or just want to go see a movie to kill soem time, I would highly reccomend Jurassic Park 3.",995587200,4,1654,4.531986531986532

The new famous actors they brought to this movie have trouble relateing to the dinosaws. They run away scared, but they are not terrified, like the people are in the 1st and 2nd movies. They just seem to have trouble believeing there real dinosaws. William H macy does a flawless job in his role untill they crash on the island, after that his acting is not as good, due to the lack of being frightened enough in the movie. I personally think that it is better than the Lost World, but very similar, because they are on a island, they were doing experiments there, everyone there, who was there is now dead etc... Except unlike the lost world this one has less story to it. At the begining parts caused me to jump but from about half way through to the end, it was just people running going ahhhh. As a dinosaw chased them, nothing new is in this film. Sam Niell does a flawless performance, however throughout the film he is always seems depressed. On the whole it is an ok movie, nothing special, just different. Its worth a watch, but I wouldn't buy it on video unless it was on sale in a box with the other 2 movies.

1298559,1,B00003CXXR,"I am with out words, (almost.) I truly enjoyed the 1st movie, and I somewhat enjoyed the sequel. I went into the theater tonight with the greatest of hopes. New direction, and not Spielberg...I thought I would see a new take on the series. And I did, straight downhill. The movie is boarder-line grade ""B"", only its CGI pull it out of this category.
I don't even know where to start. But, number one, the premise. super intelligent Raptors. From the world of science fiction we enter the world of Ed Woods. The Raptors are supposed to be smart...we know that. But, now we are to swallow the idea that they are smarter than whales, dolphins and primates and even have their own ""Raptor language"". To cover up this lie, the script calls for some impressive sounding ""double talk"" from Sam Neil. However, his lecture on the intelligence of Raptors reminded me of the lecture on how smart the Killer whale was in the low budgeted Jaws rip-off ""Orca"". By the way, Dr. Grant later talks to the raptors in their dino tongue, and ask them to leave him alone. That is just for starters.
Once on the island....I will skip the part on how they ended up there. All you need to know is that they are back on the island. (Site ""B"" for the inquisitive minds.) And they are looking for the son of two very naive parents. And immediately, with out cause or reason, we are thrown into the action sequences, one after another, with out time enough in between to draw ANY suspense. Besides a new bigger, better T-Rex, the Spinosaur, we have new ""punked out"" raptors, (they have mowhawk looking spines) just casually thrown into the mix. To top it off we are given no explanation on why, or how in either case these new dinos are there. I sure hope they don't want us to believe that they evolved in the total of five years. I would have taken about ANY reason though, except for the evolution one that is...but, we were just not given any. Most likely, because they could not think of any.
Now, we find the kid...not only that, he save Dr. Grant from the raptors, with nothing less than smoke grenades. This teenager seems no more at home in the jungle than the T-Rex did in San Diago. He should have died, to put it bluntly. But, he and his parents, blunder on to live through out the movie.
There any many other flaws in this movie, I will dwell on only two more, as to this is getting long, and I do not wish to spend any more time over this over-hyped garbage for the mass. Second to last, is the scripting. We have some very talented actors in this movie...But, with in the first 10 minutes we can already see that the line are being forced. The lines are unnatural for the characters and thus degrade them. And finally, it is only an hour and a half long! There is no time for plot development, true conflict, a climax or a proper resolution. The movie just ends. Out of nowhere...I sat there hoping to have the first plot twist of the movie as they boarded the helicopter, but NO, I was denied. As the credits rolled I sat there, in awe of how bad Joe Johnston (hopefully now) ended the Jurassic series.
I know a lot of you will see this movie, despite what I say. Some of you will even despise my criticism. But, you owe it to yourself not make the mistake I did, and see this movie.

So maybe the other characters are a little bland and not to descriptive, but why get into too much detail then kill the person off....it wouldn't be worth it anyways.... JP3 is just pure fun.

The rest of the film is sufficiently mixed with high and low adventure.  Director Joe Johnston should be proud of his achievement...a well crafted, entertaining popcorn flick that most adults and older children (over 10 or 11 years of age) will enjoy.  Parents: be conscious of the fact that these dinos eat people...and we see it.  There is also some thrilling scenes of several people being attacked.  you probably know that, but it may be a bit much for some children.  I say this because I heard young children and even (yikes!) babies crying and talking during the film.  It's summer.  This is a summer movie.  Enjoy!",995500800,,1090,4.966850828729282
1298562,2,B00003CXXR,"...I have mixed opinions about it.  At times JP3 has suspense, action, and dry humor, but at others it seems that the movie is moving along too quickly with little or no real storyline.  The scenes graduate by switching between attacks by different species of dinosaurs for the whole film, which I might add seem to have been color coordinated for the kids, until they are easily rescued by a force that basically eliminates any further suspense for the climax.  Virtually no one in the movie dies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing always, but those who do die as well as the majority of the other characters excluding Alan Grant are horribly 2-dimensional.  Sam Neill carries the movie well, and William H. Macy does too at times, though all of the interpersonal dealings between the characters are left unresolved in the end.
Bottom Line: It was much like the Mummy Returns, a fun summer movie with no real plot.  If Crichton and Speilberg had been at the helm a better movie might have resulted.",995500800,,1001,4.6971428571428575
1298592,4,B00003CXXR,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I stood in line for Jurassic Park III. It seemed to be so different from the others, with a new director and new writers. Thankfully, these changes turned out to be good ones. Director Joe Johnston injects some real energy and projects a new perspective on the concept, picking up the slack when Steven Spielberg's ""The Lost World"" lacked focus and inspiration. It's by no means a perfect movie, but it's seriously entertaining and tons of fun to watch.
Most everyone knows the plot, so I won't waste time going into it. Basically, the plot serves as an rope to string several inventive and cool action scenes together, showcasing the wily velociraptors and the new flying pteredactyls, who produce more thrills in five minutes than during the entire length of the Lost World!
Dr. Grant and the other park visitors are also stalked by the huge new super predator, the Spinosaurus, who stalks them by land and sometimes under water. It's much bigger than the T-Rex and way nastier. In fact, most of the dinosaurs in the film are really merciless and aggressive, making for some unpredictable moments.
My only problems with the film are small ones. For one thing, the special effects are sometimes excellent, with the pteredactyls, and sometimes TV-movie quality. I can think of a few scenes with the Spinosaurus which looked kind of weak and out of focus. The abrupt ending is really a disappointment too.
If all you're looking for is a spectacularly fun summer thrill ride, then Jurassic Park III is the best excuse to go to the movies this summer. So far, anyway...",995500800,,1600,4.7797833935018055

Also the serach for the kid was stupid and you can pick out whos going to die and who lives. Though it tries to be creative with new dinos mixed together but the ending is so weak with no suprises.

I was not dissapointed. I'm sure there will be plenty of nay-sayers about this film, but I think for a movie with basicly no finished script, it was pretty well done. What I didn't like was that the movie's atmosphere was too dark. And another thing: the movie released merchandise implying that the Dilophasoras would be in the movie, but it wasn't. Pretty much all the other dinos make an appearence, but the new Spinosaures is pretty cheesy. The T-Rex is still better.

1298599,4,B00003CXXR,"I wasn't sure what to think when I went to see Jurassic Park III on its opening day. Would it be as good as Jurassic Park 1? Would it be along the lines of The Lost World, with lots of dinos but not a very deep plot? Or would it totally ...? The answer is, none of the above. JP1 will always be the best, as it was a new idea and completely shocked everybody. Jurassic Park III does not have a very deep plot, but then again, when you have so many cool dinos, how do you have time for one? The dinosaur scenes are much better than Lost World. Instead of senseless killing and lots of screaming and dinosaurs, the dino scenes are very well thought out, the Raptor scenes especially. And this time around, a Raptor didn't unrealistically get its ... kicked by a kid, as in the first 2 movies. The addition of the Pteranodons was a great idea, and added a whole new dimension to the dinosaur threat. The Spinosaurus was spectacular in that, you didn't miss the T-Rex at all until the movie ended. Now that I look back on it, the T-Rex could have been used more efficiently, maybe providing a nemesis for the Spinosaurus during the whole movie and ending.(I don't want to spoil it, because it is an awesome scene, with the T-Rex and Spino.) That brings me to my last gripe. The film seems, unfinished in the end. I don't want to spoil it, but don't be surprised if you feel the same way at the end. Overall, however, this is a great movie and is probably the second best one. It gave you a feeling of awe that the second movie didnt, and the dinosaur scenes were very, very cool.",995500800,,1575,4.235880398671096

Of all scenes, I wish that there could have been some more Spinosaurus vs. T-Rex fights. Sam Neill was the only real driving force for this movie, playing his charecter well even through the cheezy dialogue. The visuals were great, as we come to expect through ILM. However, the rest of the film feels as if it were a TV Movie, coupled with one of the dumbest endings that I've ever seen. I'm glad that musical motives from John William's score were used, and the score was actually pretty good, but gone were certain moments that only a director like Steven Speilberg could create: terror. Like a puddle of water shimmering from the shock of an approaching Tyrannosaurus. Here's a hint if they do another sequel (which is almost certain, especially if the movie fares well at the box office).

1298634,4,B00003CXXR,"Let's not even let The Lost World enter the equation:  that movie was the cinematic equivalent of excrement.  About a year before Lost World hit the screens Spielberg received some kind of award for something and he proceeded to thank the myriad of writers he has worked with.  The main thing he said was ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage"".  That means if the script isn't up to snuff then it is darn near impossible for the movie to be much good.  Then, Spielberg turns around and releases The Lost World, a movie which didn't even have a completed script or third act when they started filming.  Apparently he didn't take too much stock in his own acceptance speech.  Maybe someone else wrote it for him. JP3, on the other hand, at least has a coherent script.  There are dashes of humor, suspense, and a degree of violence and carnage that the situation demands.  The movie isn't perfect, but at least it wasn't layered with the same degrees of schmaltz that tainted LW and (in spots) JP.  JP3 is a more straightforward adventure yarn, simultaneously fun and scary.  The ending could have used some punch, however.  Also of note:  earlier reports (and not by me) have indicated that chronologically this story takes place before the events in THE LOST WORLD.  Not true.  In fact, the events in THE LOST WORLD are referred to in JP3 by Sam Neill's character.  So the chronology of the trilogy is indeed linear.  And the dinosaurs in JP3 do look fantastic, too.  The only gripe about special effects that I have are the process shots during the parasailing scenes early in the film.  Well, at least the close-ups and medium shots.  They look like they were shot on a stage.  And they were, of course, but it looks so obvious to the audience.",995500800,,1756,4.546325878594249

The velociraptor and the spiked Dinosaur.  It got old after a while. 3)At the end of the other Jurassic Park movies their is always a big grand finale escape ending, I feel that this movie didn't even come close to that. 4)I thought that the young boy they were searching for and Tea Leoni became quite annoying after just a few minutes. 5)I also was disappointed that Dr. Sadler wasn't on the island but she still ""saved the day"". 6)I thought that the main pretator with the ringing cell phone in him was horribly animated.  He walked and acted more like Godzilla than a Dinosaur. 7)Many things were very unrealistic, ie. The young boy couldn't have stayed alive on the island for 8 weeks alive and by himself. 8)Don't even ask about the Pterodactal. 9)Just as you think the movie may be getting a little better, it ENDS! 10)You can assume from the ending of this movie that there will be another sequel, and it will probably be worse than this!!!

1298638,2,B00003CXXR,"""Computer geeks playing with their toys"" would be a good way to describe the plot of this film. In this age of rampant technology we're seeing more and more movies being made based upon the technology available. Plot is an afterthought - the focus is in finding ways to exploit new computer graphics.
The fact is, there was no reason for this film to be made. There is nothing in it that cannot be found in one of the first two films. I mean this literally, for in some cases actual ""plot"" lines were borrowed. The worst part about this film may be that its one redeeming quality - the effects - were actually poorer than the original which came out in '93.
The ridiculous unrealism that crept into ""The Lost World"" runs rampant in JP3, providing us with memorable scenes such as a cell phone's ring being heard through a giant dinosaur's body (he swallowed it), raptor's speaking to each other, Grant learning their language and communicating with them (why yes, I speak Raptonian...), and a kid who in a few weeks alone on the island has become a dinosaur and survival expert.
There is no reason whatsoever I can give to you to go see this film, especially if you've seen the first two. But, if JP4 comes out, maybe they'll give the raptors subtitles. I'd pay to see that.",995414400,7,1274,4.495689655172414

But honestly, the end seems to be seguing into ""Jurassic Park IV: Lost in New York."" I guess that's fine with me; somehow, the evil pterodactyls, with screaming humans in their talony clutches, seem better suited to perching on the Empire State Building than they do the jungles of Costa Rica.
Sam Neill, however, may be the Indiana Jones we never knew we had. Pulling his indestructible paleontologist's hat tightly onto his head and giving us a quirky grin, we wonder: does he know this was all the equivalent of a dime-store pulp novel? Could Dr. Grant possibly be mocking us? Does he get a joke we all missed?

The only reason that I didn't rate it five stars is for the following two reasons:  1) there was some cheesy humor that didn't fit well into the film (some of it did, though).  2) The filmmakers are inaccurate in the size of the Spinosaursus, it is actually smaller than the T-Rex.  Even though that's really no big deal, it just kind of irritates me.

As I stated in the title, this is a fitting third chapter in the series.  It lacks a bit in the acting department and story development, but more than makes up for it with the special effects and excitement. As the titles have gone on, the dinosaurs have gotten more and more realistic, to the point in this one where they are seamlessly integrated into the story.  I won't give anything a way here, which makes it a bit tough to tell you about any of these scenes, but suffice to say that this movie will, as the others in this series have done, amaze you with the level of work gone into the detail of the dinosaurs.
Again, as I said before, the plot of this movie will not garner it a ""Best Picture"" nomination, but neither will it severely disappoint you.  Just remember, it's a summer blockbuster, a popcorn movie in a series of popcorn movies, and if you go in with that mindset, you'll have a fun time at this movie!

Some of the humor doesn't really work, for example Sam Neil has a dream of a raptor talking to him which is kind of funny but doesn't really fit in the film. Still though for a 90 minute film JP3 does have the most entertaining edge of your seat action of any of them. The dinosaurs are scarier than ever, that Spinesauras is terrifying, plus Joe Johnson knows how to use him. You probably won't care about seeing a T-Rex in the next after seeing him. Although the film just ends and doesn't leave you thinking ""WOW"", instead you're like ""it's over ?"", it's funny how it still manages to be satisfying though. Plus it's good to see the underapreciated Sam Neil back because I think he's one of the missing elements that Lost World needed. It was kind of hard to take Jeff Goldbluim serious in Lost World after he was so wacky in the first, plus him having a black kid didn't help much. Speaking of kids, the one in the 3rd is less annoying than the ones in the others, but still in part 4 leave the kids at home!",995414400,,1120,4.283018867924528
1298663,1,B00003CXXR,"I waited patiently for today.  Being an avid Jurassic Park fan, I spent my lunch seeing the premiere showing of Jurassic Park 3 here in San Bernardino, CA.  I was truly disappointed.  It insulted my intelligence with a horrible plot and unbelievably weak script.  It is an insult to Spielberg's initial classic and its sequel (The Lost World).  Don't get me wrong, it is a visual spectacle and you get the chance to see and hear the dino's munch and crunch everyone in site, but it has no substance.  And yes, Spielberg had nothing to do with this one.  It shows.  the music by John Williams.  Dr. Grant is back and Laura Dern, who starred in the first film but passed on the second, has a limited role...it should have been expanded.  I heard on the radio this morning that after Spielberg saw this film, he wants to do JP4.  He'd better.  Or I won't waste my money.  Go see it if you just want to be entertained.  It never taxes your brain.  It may insult your intelligence as I mentioned before.  Based on my summer movie experience, even Scary Movie 2 and all of its raunchiness was better.  I definitely recommend Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence and the recent Final Fantasy over this one.  However, if you've never seen JP1 or 2, you may enjoy this because a standard wouldn't have been set.  If I was Spielberg, I'd sue.

1298664,4,B00003CXXR,"After the horrible ""Lost World"", the Jurassic Park series redeems itself with JP3 (ironically, without the vaunted directorial power of Steven Spielberg who was the one who dropped the ball with the last film).  But let's not kid ourselves...Jurassic Park has never been about revolutionary film making (with the possible exception in the special effects department) or thought provoking plotlines.  No, from the very beginning the first Jurassic Park film set a tone of fun, thrilling entertainment done with enough charm and intelligence to pass as respectable moviemaking.  In this spirit, JP3 lives up to the original and will not disappoint.  ""The Lost World"" was full of cheap thrills and gore but sorely lacked any real character and style, but JP3 succeeds where the previous film failed.
For one thing, the characters have enough personality and liveliness to actually hold a film and make the viewer care when it looks like they're about to be eaten by a pteranodon.  The quality cast brings a good amount of substance to a pretty conventional plot (this may have something to do with the fact that the front runner is Sam Neill again this time rather than Jeff Goldblum).  The dialogue has some interesting exchanges ad there is a good amount of smart humor that really made me enjoy this film a lot.  At times, the movie even pokes fun at itself and the Jurassic Park series at large, which makes for great fun.
JP3 is definitely not without flaws though.  Director Joe Johnston does a great job stepping in for Spielberg, but Spielberg still cannot be beat in the thrills department.  The tension and anticipation of the first film is sorely missing.  Although the CGI dinosaurs are the same (if not a bit better), Johnston simply doesn't give them the same intimidation and personality as Spielberg did in the first film.  The kills are not nearly as stylish as in JP1, but they are also not as needlessly bloody and graphic as in The Lost World.  The body count is actually kind of low this time around which was a bit disappointing to me.  There was at least one character who really should have been dino food but for some reason they actually let this person live!  I must also say that despite technological advancements in the area of CGI, much of the dino effects didn't really look all that convincing to me.  Perhaps there was not enough blending of actual models along with the CGI.  The movie is also a little bit on the short side and without giving away too much, I will say that the ending rescue really had a lot more potential than the anti-climactic way it turned out.  The ending was a bit disappointing.  The bottom line is that this film will not fill you with the same awe and wonder as the first film (yep, the first is still the best) but it is still far better than the second and it will fulfill your wish for a quality dose of cheap matinee entertainment in a summer that has so far been dsappointing.",995414400,,2941,4.655705996131528
1298665,5,B00003CXXR,"First off let me say that this movie is not about dramatic performances and plot.  It's about seeing really big dinosaurs eat people and each other in very entertaining ways.  In this area, the movie succeeds like neither of it's predecessors.  It brings us bigger, badder dinosaurs, cooler effects sequences, and no jeff goldblum.  The most exciting sequence is one in which we see the normal Dino-human beat-down, except this time, it's high in the air over a river full of jagged rocks.  I can't even express how good it was to have Sam Niell's Dr. Grant back instead of Goldblum's annoying malcom.  When I heard that Stephen Spielberg would not be directing, I thought this would be a bad thing.  I was very wrong.  Joe Johnston handled the film masterfully, making it just as intense and frightening as either of the first two in the series, if not more so.  Another Great addition to this movie is the much needed humor that was missing from ""lost world"".  Goldblum provided the humor in the original, but in ""lost world"" he was a serious guy with way too many lines.  In this film, William H. Macy is very humorous as the father of a child who went missing on Isla Sorna 8 weeks earlier.  Him and his ex-wife, played by tea Leoni, convince Grant and his student to come with them to the island, under the false pretences that they are a wealthy couple just wanting Grant to point out the sights on the island as they fly above.  They give him a huge amount of money, so he decides to come along.  When they get to the island, he learns that they are actually a search party looking for the lost child.  The plane crashes and they are left to run from dinosaurs until help arrives.  Pure Cinematic Genius.  This is, along with ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" the best big budget movie of the summer. Go see it.  By the way, expect JP IV sometime in the near future.",995414400,,1875,4.464705882352941

1298669,3,B00003CXXR,"I've always had a personal connection avec the original JP...it came out and one of the happiest times of my life; perhaps that's why I've projected that it was a great movie. Certainly it holds a technique that the sequal and this third installment lack: incessant suspense. Yes, there were some suspensful intentions, but many never followed through. Perhaps the fact that it is a mere 92 minutes as compared to the first two which were two hours+. This film also lacks the majestic qualities and the inspiration of awe, the feeling that you were taking in something new and unique just as the charcacters in the movie were and the inability to comprehend the situations put forth before them. It seems that JP2 and 3 have a fatal flaw (predictability and casualness).
Mind you, I certainly enjoyed the action sequences. I'd go as far to say that they are certainly braver than the originals. You can tell Spielberg did not direct this movie. It is not overly sentimental. Instead it harbors a darker flavor and it works well.
It's a shame that the movie has a tendency to drop dead with banal dialogue. There's a speech delivered with William H. Macy about the joys of fishing trips with his ex-wife, Tea Leonie. Yes, that's right. Ex-wife. Yes, you've seen Twister and you've seen the Parent Trap so you know the formula. Happily, we care so little about the characters (though I should note that they are wonderfully acted by a quasi-all star cast) that wether they live or die is not an issue. We care more about the action and adventure. The action and adventure sequences are so top notch that we are left wanting much more. But they've followed Hollywood's ONLY pertinant Golden Rule: Leave your audience wanting more. Unfortunatly, you should have some sort of conclusion before abruptly ending the film with no catharsis.
Jurassic Park is not something I would consider a movie, I would consider it an object. It is not pretentious, it does not masquerade as art. It is a movie that you can go and enjoy without having to get involved with characters. As opposed to other knock 'em out formula films, JP films always always succeeds in entertaing you no matter how thin the plots are. I definatly reccomend this film. It is a perfect summer movie. By all means, hang disbelief at the door, sit down with you popcorn and enjoy seeing a Spinosaurus (or Tricephlaplotz as William H. Macy calls it) eat an airplane.",995414400,,2422,4.714622641509434
1298670,1,B00003CXXR,"Oh boy what a bad film its was so bad that one cant even describe it.  As someone who like the first two reasonably well I was shocked at how bad this film was.  It wasn't even bad in a good way like Battlefield Earth.  What is sad is that people are going to like it!  True the visuale effects are great and better than the first two but all special effects and no plot or substance don't add up to a good film.  It may only be good to those people out there who totaly stop thinking and be dumb for two hours ( Im not talking about kids, kids are born to like this film) Im sorry I cant do, that Im not George W.  The truly dood thing in this movie was the Spider-Man trailer before the movie began, that was the only thing that made my spending ... worth while.",995414400,3,764,3.9285714285714284
1298671,1,B00003CXXR,"This has got to be one of the least exiting movies I've seen in quite some time.
I must admit I didn't see the first 10 min, but the rest of it was boring from one end to the other, and no doubt the first part was just as boring. First stupid thing they do is land on this Island with their plane to search for a lost child. Second stupid thing is the mother grabbing a megafone beginning YELLING after her child, and as some might guess, it doesnt take 5 min before they are attacked by some dino, they try to take off, crash and is attacked by the same dino. Then your first 3-5 people is dead (didnt keep count...). The same pridictable store continue 'til the end and even the most exiting chase scenes don't get your blod pumping.
The actors are actually fine actors, but either the instructor or the script truly suck, because they simply don't live up to their expectations.

The humor is well placed and keeps the film rolling right along. I thought it seemed a bit short, but in the times of movies like A.I. and other long epics, I guess less is sometimes more.
Great action, great effects!

1298704,4,B00003CXXR,"Let's face it, 80% of us will go watch this movie if only because we want to recapture the thrill of the first (and still the best) Jurassic Park. Scenes of the the scientists Grant and Sattler meeting their first live dinosaur on Isla Nublar as well as the way T-Rex gobbled up the lawyer will always be remembered as the gems they are. Plus it had a great storyline to go with it (the book was better, tho).
  Which brings us to JP3, the third instalment of the JP series. Sam Neil is back as Dr. Alan Grant, so is Laura Dern (in a minor role), and of course T-Rex. Grant accompanies two 'extreme adventurers' played by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy into Isla Sorna otherwise known as Ingen Corp.'s Site B. Their plane crashes (of course) and they are left to their own devices on the island battling the dinos. Like most sequels, the plot is minimal. ""Build them dinos and they will come."" must have been their motto.  It was as if they didn't have a screenplay to begin with and decided to let the CGI people figure out the plot as they went along creating the dinos.
  T-Rex, like Dern, only appears briefly as a new leaner and meaner dinosaur takes centrestage - the spinosaurus. Larger and smarter, it tracks down the dwindling party as they try to find their way out of the island. Oh, and satelite phone sales might skyrocket this year.
The velociraptors also reprise their role as the intelligent almost human creatures. Only this time, they can erm... talk. Well in dino language at least. However, perhaps the best surprise of them all, are the pteradactyls. I was disappointed when the first JP didn't feature these great flying killling machines, but here they're given their fifteen minutes of fame as they soar through the valleys and cliffs pecking away at Grant and the others in what I feel is the best sequence of the entire 90 minutes of the film.
I won't give any more of the (weak) storyline away except to say that it has all the usual (but essential) ingredients needed for a successful summer movie - lots of suspense, action, estranged characters get back together when faced with impending doom..... And no, there are no T-Rex chasing people in San Diego  scenes.
I really wasn't expecting much for this film  and as a result I was pleasantly surprised. It had that a-thrill-a-minute kind of feel to it that rivalled the first JP. And it is after all a sequel to a sequel. As a result it lacked the element of surprise. But it quite makes up for it with the excellent CGI and cinematography. A word of caution: It's not really suitable for children as the blood and gore is rivals that of the first JP. So, parents beware.
My main complain (as will be yours when you've seen it) is the abrupt and dissapointing ending. Loose ends weren't tied, dinos were still roaming around and worse, Tea Leoni was still alive.  It felt as though the director or producer had enough of the film at the 90th minute mark and said, ""OK, that's it. We'll end it here."" But if you can forgive them for that final gaff (the Marines? What were they thinking??), then perhaps you'll like this show enough to go watch it again if only to see those Pteradactyls soar once more. It's a summer popcorn movie, what did you expect?",995155200,33,3231,4.492333901192504
1298705,5,B00003CXXR,"First and foremost I must admit I loved the first two movies, so to rate this one is basically impossible, I'm not able to give it less than five stars (maybe four and a half).
The movie is a very intense thrill ride, but not gory as many want to make believe, just as much blood as in the previous movies in the series. The action scenes (which are a lot) beat even the ""T-Rex trashes the Explorers"" of JP1. My only complaint is that all the action scenes don't last longer, in fact the whole movie clocks around 90 minutes. And the end... it seems as if they ran out of time, which is funny considering JP & TLW are at least half-hour longer.
Personally, i liked the Pteros scenes better than the much hyped T-rex/Spynoo fight, which was great too, but the outcome (and lenght) was disappointing. The sets in this one are very moody, too, the jungle, the abandoned labs and the birdcage ae awesome. It's hard to rank in which place this one ends up when comparing it to the other two. I think they are all tied in first place, each one with their's own flaws and strenghts.
Anyway, I thank the heavens this movie was available in sneak-peek here so early!
My final word is that if you liked JP and TLW, you'll like this one... now, it's time to wait for that DVD release and (probably) JP4.",995068800,4,1292,4.299180327868853

THAT'S what the first two movies lacked: fog.  i'm seeing it opening day with my girlfriend and i can't wait to see how many of my suspicions/conclusions are correct.  i'm especially looking forward to the appearence of the spinosaurus and william h. macy (i loved his performance in fargo.)  so...see the movie",995068800,,851,4.474025974025974
1298707,2,B00003CXXR,"Once you've seen JP II and JP I, you've seen enough. I don't know the exact reason Spielberg didn't do this film, but to me it's pretty obvious: wouldn't you get tired of being stuck on a park with Dinosaurs?  I mean how many different plots can you come up with given that they're extinct?  How many times can you stretch the plausibility of this?  This movie sounds like a desperate attempt on the studios lacking creative innovation to try to milk the JP franchise for all it's worth without respecting the audience's desire to see something new. A good rule of thumb in making a sequel is that you have to add something new and worthwhile and have something to say that you didn't say in the movies prior to the sequel.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't seem to live up to that rule.  If you want a good action movie, try Kiss of the Dragon.",995068800,3,846,4.397435897435898
