My sociology teacher in college had us watch this to demonstrate ""who we are to this world"" and what people are willing to do for their beliefs... This video depicts many cultures and religions all over the world. I found it to be extremely interesting... Leonard Nimoy narrated well and I will be buying this! Highly recommend! Enjoy!",1426550400,,399,4.882352941176471

Just such simple explanations that it may work for high school, but at college level, it didn't add much.  The narration was strong, but the subject matters weak and not fleshed out.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't say ""fleshed out"" when talking bout rites of death... LOL",1355875200,,339,4.616666666666666
