8522312,4,B007VTEEPK,"Richard Clear's instruction demystifies the foundations of internal arts, in this case Ba Gua Zhang.  He does not dive into finer points of palm strikes here but gives a tactical overview of Bagauzhang.  Because of the clarity of instruction and it's focus on the practical I give this 4 stars.  The top tier of video bagua instruction has been set by YMAA Baguazhang - 8 Trigrams Palm.  I'm still searching for a dvd set that combines the practicality of Richard Clear's instruction with the precision of YMAA Baguazhang... please let me know if I've missed it.",1435622400,2,562,4.822916666666667

8522315,5,B007VTEEPK,"If you are a martial artist, you can get no better instruction than from Richard E Clear JR he is a true Master that knows how to transmit functional utility from whatever art you learn from him. No, I am not one of his personal students. ( I wish I lived close enough to him to be one though.) Not in person anyway but, just watch what he does, how he does it, and hear what he says and how he distills complicated and complex information into simple and easy to understand terms in a way that enables you to actually use what he is teaching you about and you will know that he is a true master of whatever art he chooses to teach others about. He is a tall drink of cool water in a desolate waste land of Mc Dojo's and false marketing. Yes, Mr. Clear is the Real Deal. I would recommend all of his products! For this particular DVD I would also recommend the previous two videos to this one as it would definitely help you understand all concepts. I did not initially as Bagua was my primary interest at this time,  but now I want those too, yet I still learned a tremendous amount from this one on it's own.",1375315200,6,1110,4.138888888888889
8522316,5,B007VTEEPK,"One of the most powerful things about Richard Clear's teaching ability,he hold countless styles under his belt, is the ease with which he explains it. He has the natural ability to break down his technique in a simplified matter so as to get his method across. I highly recommend Sifu Clear and ALL the arts he teaches in ANY videos.
