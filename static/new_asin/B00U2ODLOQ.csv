7027915,4,B00U2ODLOQ,"Albeit Virtuous was initially recommended as starring Erik Estrada, it is Jessica Lynch's name which ultimately caught my daughter's attention. Personally, I always appreciate the opportunity to introduce new Christian movies in view of the doubtful choices offered by Hollywood myself.

This latest Dove Foundation approved film shows different women challenged by abuse under different circumstances, be it bodily or verbal and their triumph over adversity.
We are reminded of the virtues listed under Proverbs 31, a true celebration of womanhood and an inspiration to all of us, young and old.

Finally, whilst the acting was nothing exciting, I found the scenario interesting and the songs very pleasurable.

Due to thematic contents, I would recommend it to older teens and family viewing.
Check out the special features.
Overall, I give it 4 stars.

7027916,5,B00U2ODLOQ,"In light of programming available for our families, it is such a thrill to find incredible movies that are not only amazing but share a valuable moral lesson straight from the Bible as if they are modern day parables. Receiving 5 out of 5 Doves, by the Dove Foundation, Virtuous from JC Films has been released on DVD for your home entertainment. It conveys the message behind the Proverbs 31 woman, one of faith, integrity, wisdom, and honor!

Singer/songwriter Brandy Allison stars as Simone Burner, a young college student who is returning home late one night after working a double shift as a waitress only to be followed by a man Patrick Walters, she meets with a group of friends outside a club. They want Simone to stay and enjoy the evening but she is too tired to stay. Instead of accepting her refusal to join them, Patrick tries to convince Simone to come stay with them, and no matter how hard she tries to dissuade him, he won't take no for an answer. Inside a dark alcove as they struggle, he is shot and Simone is left as a person of interest, especially when the gun she said she found on the ground outside her apartment goes missing.

A District Attorney looking for re-election caves to the wealth of Patrick's grandfather, who insists that Simone be charged with murder and her arrest be made swiftly. They incorporate one of the officers assigned to the case,  Detective Avery, who is convinced that Simone is guilty despite all the evidence facing her. She is assigned the case along with sealed documents from Simone's less than stellar past to help bring about the charges as quickly as possible. Simone's only chance for redemption is through an attorney Jack Evans (Erik Estrada) who offers free consultation for any case. Along the way, three other stories begin to emerge along the way of other women who are struggling to find their own self worth in a world that wants only to condemn and control them.

I received Virtuous by JC Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review with only a complementary copy of the DVD provided. The opinions in this review are strictly my own. I really LOVED the overwhelming theme of the movie as it really pertains to women's struggle for discovering self worth and affirmation doesn't need to come from the world or anyone but through knowing we are daughters of the One True King, Jesus Christ! A must for any young girl struggling with low self esteem or finding out who she is outside of what the world has to offer. There is even a Behind The Scenes Look with the Cast and Crew included and a Discussion Guide is available at VirtuousFilm.com. Well worth every single 5 out of 5 stars!",1432944000,,2724,4.621900826446281
7027917,5,B00U2ODLOQ,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.

I'm a firm believer in mercy, grace, and the power of forgiveness. I'm a firm believer in hope, faith, and second chances. I'm a firm believer in the saving grace and redemption available through Jesus Christ the Son of God. There's no bad that's too bad, no low that's too low, no sinner that's too sinful for Jesus to redeem.

That's exactly why God came to Earth in the form of a sinless man as the child born in the manger. He was the perfect sacrifice for every sinner ever born and every sin ever committed, past, present, or future. Your hope is in Jesus Christ. Ask Him today to save you. He's waiting.

VIRTUOUS is all about the changes that can happen in a person's life and how the past influences the future. The plot a little chaotic until you realize that all of the characters are going to come together in the story, and nearly all are facing a battle of their own. It is a story with many stories within. We're all facing troubles of our own. Finding the strength to go on, to make important decisions, to change is central to the plot. VIRTUOUS shows that while following the primary story of a young woman accused of murder not because of evidence but because of her past.

***Our thirteen year old didn't watch this with us. I think it's for older teens through adults because of references to adult themes and scenes. There is nothing that I found embarrassing; however, she is too young for it.***",1432771200,,1464,4.451492537313433
7027918,5,B00U2ODLOQ,"Virtuous is a movie about many different women, but the main focus is on Simone who murders a man because he tried to assault her. She has a bad past but is now trying to lead a decent life.
  It is also about a young woman who was in the war and got captured and tortured, but God gives her the strength to keep going.
  Another woman in the movie is an older judge who puts up with an abusive husband. Not beating her, but verbal abuse.
  How they all hear in church that God loves them and they are precious in His sight. How this insight changes each of these woman and also others.
  Jack Evans is Simones lawyer and he proves that this has happened before to many women, but they didn't do anything about it.
  If you want a faith-based movie that shows how women overcome the trials they go through with the Lords help this movie is for you.
  Excellent acting and very good actors.  Highly recommended and very enjoyable.

7027919,5,B00U2ODLOQ,A movie that dwells on absolute truth in a world of big money versus innocent drifters who are literally made the fall guy.  Beautifully written with actors who superbly brought their characters to life.  Deeply moving emotions portrayed in this film with the ultimate aim - redemption is truly ours if we only believe in a Most High God who can and will forgive and allow all to begin again.,1465948800,,392,4.585714285714285

7027925,5,B00U2ODLOQ,"This movie has several characters who are facing different trials in their lives. The main character has come a long way from her troubled past but now has the past coming back to haunt her, her attorney who is still grieving his daughter, a female judge who is constantly being belittled by her husband, and a reporter who wants to make it big so she compromises her principles. A pastor who teaches about the Proverbs 31 woman helps some of these characters realize that they are daughters of the King and should respect themselves and expect respect in return causing changes in their lives. This movie shows that faith and steadfastness can help you get though tough times.

7027927,3,B00U2ODLOQ,"Somehow it didn't hold together like some Christian based movies we have seen.  It is not NEARLY as good as the movie, Fireproof. So am comparing it to one of the best we have seen, which is Fireproof.",1440720000,,201,4.2894736842105265
7027928,3,B00U2ODLOQ,"There are some strong female roles in this film who represent women who have gone through various forms of neglect or abuse who each come to terms with their past and overcome it as they realize their value as daughters of the King. From Si (Brandy Allison)who has left behind a life of abandonment and drugs, an ambitious news reporter (Vanessa Ore) who has left her faith behind as she seeks to advance her career, A cop (Angelita Nelson) bitter over her husband's betrayal, a soldier (Jenni Ivers) who is captured and tortured by the Taliban, a single mom (Melissa Barron), and a retiring judge (Bonnie Johnson) who is emotionally abused by her husband. Each of the women have storylines that intertwine, but it takes a while before the stories come together enough for the pieces to fall into place. I enjoyed the second half of the movie more than I did the first.

To be honest, the first 5 minutes were not good at all and I am certain that had an impact on my attitude as I watched the film. Then with all of the loose threads of stories that had not yet come together, I had problems staying focused on the action. I commend Director of Photography, James Burgess, on the look of the film, but some of the dialogue and acting was cringe-worthy. I wasn't crazy about musical choices (and a good soundtrack can make or break a film for me) and some of the scenes just didn't quite make sense to me. I was even able to (reluctantly, LOL!) overlook that one of the more obnoxious characters was a staunch fan of my beloved University of Alabama. I don't want to say there were not good moments, because there were several, especially in the second half of the movie that did really touch me. But I would have missed them had I not been reviewing the film since the weak beginning would normally have me turning it off. So, it has some good points that are worth waiting for, but is more of a ""preaching to the choir"" type movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but only still it is a mediocre film.

The film, directed by Bill Rahn, is slightly over 2 hours and is probably not suitable for anyone under 13. Other cast members include Erin Bethea, Ben Davies, and Jessica Lynch. For more information, go to www.virtuousfilm.com.
