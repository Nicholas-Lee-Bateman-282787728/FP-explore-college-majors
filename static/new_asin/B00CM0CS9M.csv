5726331,4,B00CM0CS9M,"If you're a cartoon buff, but don't want to spend big bucks on a collection from just one studio, then consider this specific Warner Bros. Academy Award-Nominated Animation DVD. I found this at Walmart for $5, and I was very impressed. There are some amazing cartoons here that have set milestones in animation history.
For those who are expecting perfect restorations: PROS: A Wild Hare (1940) and the previously BANNED Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt (1941), both cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny, are shown with ORIGINAL TITLES! And BLITZ WOLF, a non-Droopy Tex Avery MGM cartoon, makes its HD DEBUT IN NORTH AMERICA!
CONS: Popeye The Sailor Meets Sindbab The Sailor (1936), though previously restored for the Popeye DVD set, does not have the correct ending score. The original Paramount logo is seen at the end, but the a.a.p. ending musical fanfare is still intact. Also, Puss Gets The Boot (1940) has what seems to be a digitally recreated title card? And with the exception of A Wild Hare and Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt, all WB cartoons on this DVD release have their Blue Ribbon rerelease titles which do not credit the directors involved.
Nonetheless, this is a great set at a great value. This is the most diverse WB cartoon set as it contains Warner Bros., MGM, and Paramount cartoons (out of the latter, WB only owns the Fleischer/Famous Studio Popeye cartoons (1933-1957) and the Superman cartoons (1941-1943)).
