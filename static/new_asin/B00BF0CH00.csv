8567477,1,B00BF0CH00,"I wanted a stability ball workout, and this is good for that, but there is too much stopping and starting - no flow - and Jessica talks to much, I found I was waiting for the exercises to start already! while she kept rambling about form.  This is for someone who has never exercised on a ball before.  I might consider doing this again but with the sound turned way down or off completely",1395705600,,389,4.243243243243243
8567478,1,B00BF0CH00,"I have been working out for 30 years now, and I have purchased 40-50 exercise videos over the years. I have never found one that I truly hated until this one. It is obvious that Jessica knows what she is talking about, but she never stops talking. She starts and stops constantly to make sure that you have the proper form etc. This would all be well and good if the DVD contained another version of the sets without the stopping, starting and repetitive information. Jessica doesn't have a pleasant speaking voice, which made it all the more irritating for me. I would definitely give this one a ""thumbs down"". It could be a good work-out, but the way the sessions are presented makes it difficult for me to do use it again.",1392249600,2,725,4.458646616541353
8567479,4,B00BF0CH00,"I wanted another ab/core work out that would use my ball.  This one certainly does.  I have not gotten beyond the initial 15 minute work out, but I do certainly look forward to it.  The video is nice, in that it is a different way for me to move.",1387238400,,246,3.979591836734694
