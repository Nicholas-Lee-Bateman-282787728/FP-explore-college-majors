5979415,5,B00FEAKKV0,"Anyone interested in the history of gay porn and its pioneers will be intrigued and fascinated by this excellent documentary of Toby Ross. Probably the most appealing aspect of this film is Toby's incredible memory of events many moons ago and his charming matter-of-fact delivery.  Despite being mostly a talking head type of documentary there are still ample slices of erotic clips featuring his hunky and tantalizingly beautiful ""discoveries"" from his films plus never ending ""action"" being shown on the monitors behind him.  A very clever way of displaying enough hard-core sex to whet the appetite without going over the top. The filmmakers have successfully captured a very special period of gay porn and in particular the influence of changing times and the heady atmosphere of 1970's San Francisco.  And Toby Ross comes across as the very genuine article and a breath of fresh air in what is often regarded as a ""not so nice"" profession.
There are also some good extras on this disc, most notably a number of trailers from Ross films, mainly more recent ones, which are enjoyable and quite hilarious.",1403308800,12,1108,5.010869565217392
5979416,5,B00FEAKKV0,"An excellant documentary from Toby Ross detailing the 1970s in San Francisco.  I would also highly recommend the e-Book of the same title (also available on Amazon) which goes into greater detail of people, places and events.",1401062400,2,225,5.081081081081081
5979417,5,B00FEAKKV0,"This is a landmark film  in the league and spirit of MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO.  It is an incredible American story  the life and times of porn film director Toby Ross.  It is a PBS worthy historical documentary. But the beautiful young men from the past make the film worth the price alone. This is A+ work.

I was fascinated with the behind the scenes descriptions of film technique, use of natural light, and the need for actors to say there lines correctly.  At times the film takes the viewer on a trip to another planet like the video of a packed theater in Montreal where one of Tobys films plays accompanied by a live doo-wap band.  The film is nicely edited by Joe Rubin. Joe looks hotter since he cleaned up his vibe.",1387497600,12,722,4.343283582089552
5979418,5,B00FEAKKV0,"TOBY ROSS & THE 70S is an artists autobiography, though directed by Joe Rubin, (Ross is lovingly referred to just another old master), liberally illustrated with clips from Ross porn movies, touchingly depicting San Francisco when it was the steaming center of the Gay Revolution. Commentaries remind us what that Revolution meant to lonely, scared gay lads, escaping from restrictions which are now nearly unimaginable. Ross himself is a charming, bright, chatty presence (and is a damned handsome twink in a clip from a film he was in). It was a time when porn wasn't dirty, It was, for both the maker and his model, a personal gesture toward freedom! We get delightful backstage stuff from risky shoots, and absorbing tips on filming porn. The richness of memories and minutiae this movie offers is beyond description.  Remember Wakefield Poole? Big Bill Eld? Jeff Stryker?",1387065600,11,876,5.083333333333333

8614745,4,B00FEAKKV0,"I know there were some 'iffy' reviews on this - the editing is amateurish and production isn't great, but the guy's story is an interesting look back to a particular era.  I wouldn't call this porn - there isn't enough sex to even call it that though.",1519084800,,251,4.340425531914893
8614746,1,B00FEAKKV0,"Not only does the quality of the material stink, but the disc itself gets hung up every few seconds. I guess I could send it back, but I definitely don't want a replacement. The interviews are a chore, and who on earth is that sub-frat-house band?",1492992000,,247,4.391304347826087
8614747,2,B00FEAKKV0,"Horribly dull with an older Toby talking with movies occasionally in the background. His accent got on my nerves right away (French, German?) and the film consists in a boring obnoxious ""hipster"" asking him questions. There is also another self-important ""hipster"" who is so ashamed of being a red head he dyes his hair and beard. Near the end it shows him getting a haircut. WHF!!  I had to jump forward after the first 5 minutes. Incredibly dull, shows as many shots of NYC as SF (and no new ground there).  Be warned and save your money!",1437436800,,540,4.556701030927835
