Unfortunately this series didn't quite gel for me. Started off well but I felt it lost its way in subsequent episodes. IMHO it placed too much emphasis on the awkwardness of the heroine and storylines suffered as a consequence.

Production values are high so there is no complaint there. It is in no way horrible to watch but I must admit to skipping from ep 6 straight to the last ep as it had lost my interest somewhat.

One big con IMHO is that the ending doesn't wrap everything up so those who don't like fairly open endings I'd say this is one you should avoid. It is NOT a complete cliffhanger as the episode's storyline is wrapped up but there is a scene that follows that is best described as leaving a ""to be continued"" feel. Perhaps the writers expected that there'd be a second season?

The series was based on a novel of the same name but I have been unable to find anything about how the novel ended.

In summary by no means unwatchable but could have been better.",1401062400,,995,4.385869565217392

8553332,5,B0011VW5BE,"Mop Girl is the story of Momoko Hasegawa (played by Keiko Kitagawa), a woman who is working as a wedding coordinator.  Unfortunately, she has a very embarassing accident at one of her weddings which leads to her to being re-assigned to another division of the company--funeral services.  She becomes even more discouraged when she finds that she has been assigned to the clean-up division responsible for cleaning up messy crime scenes.

In this line of work, however, she discovers that she has a special gift.  When she touches an item of the deceased, she is sent back in time.  With this power, she can try to prevent the murder from happening.  She retains full knowledge of the case, however, the details may turn out to be very different from what everyone assumes.  Momoko must rush to prevent the crimes from happening with the reluctant help of the boss of the clean-up division.  The stories are always fascinating to watch.

I've rated this item with 5 stars.  Beware, this is for the series itself.  The actual DVD for sale here on Amazon is a Chinese bootleg.  It is obviously recorded directly from TV as it still has the commercial sponsors listed after the opening credits.  Also, the recording itself is not good.  It appears to have been recorded directly onto a computer as there are issues of pixelation and less than clear focus.  The English subtitles are nearly unreadable.  They were obviously written by someone with a very loose grasp of the English language.  If you can't understand the original Japanese, you may find the English subtitles more of a distraction than a help.

However, there is one more thing to note.  This series is out of print in Japan, so even if you wanted to get a legitimate copy you couldn't.  Since the original print run was very small, you cannot even find used copies for sale--at any price--even in Japan.  So this may be your only option other than watching the series on YouTube.

I hope a legitimate copy of this is released soon.",1241481600,,1993,4.715942028985507
