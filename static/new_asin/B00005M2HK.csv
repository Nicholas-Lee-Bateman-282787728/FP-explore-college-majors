7944914,3,B00005M2HK,"I like the actors, they are funny mostly because they are enjoying themselves and each other so much. I also like seeing them all play such different roles. But the writing of most of these ""Carry On,"" films is mediocre at best.",1444089600,,228,4.4523809523809526

7944918,5,B00005M2HK,I love the earlier Carry On Movies.  Charles Hawtrey is extremely funny!  Good British humor that you are sure to enjoy.  The Carry On movies do carry on with the theme of guys oogling girls...but it is tame...not offensive.,1319068800,,224,4.6923076923076925
7944919,4,B00005M2HK,"Following on from the success of one of the best entries out of the entire series, Carry On Again Doctor (1969), the gang retreat into another historical theme. The gang are all on an expidition through dark Africain 1900 and encounter a Tarzan type figure on the way and get kidnapped by an all female tribe. Lots of fun to be had. Only weakness is in its blatantly obvious studio setting, using inevitably enough real stock footage variously throughout the film. Despite that shortcoming, the film holds many fine comic moments amongst the adventures that take place in it. Frankie Howard takes a part origanally written for Kenneth Williams and gets top billing over series regular, Sid James. Frankie actually breezes into the carry On mood seemingly effortlessly and fills in the outrageous campness thats usually provided by Kenneth Williams. Although Charles Hawtrey is given third billing he is not seen until at least within the last 30 minute of the film. However his considerably small supporting role is used to great comic event deeming his character an integral part in the film. Joan Sims, a fine actress and comidienne is of good value in this entry and is most defintley in one of her best characterisations that deservedly gains a lot of screen time in this one. The hilarious scene where a snake winds up Sims dress and she thinks in quiet delight that Frankie Howard is making advances at her, is a classic. Kenneth Connor returns to the series, his first Carry On in many years whilst Terry Scott takes the Tarzan role that was origanally written for Jim Dale, but Scott comes into his own whils Jaki Piper and Bernard Bresslaw bubble along in the background but each do get to have some good lines to deliver.
Carry On Up The Jungle drew a mixed critical response. Some critics claimed that this entry was weak in comparison to the acclaimed Up The Kyber (1968) and Cleo (1964), but to me this firmly retains the quality of those entries. Although patchy in parts the film picks up a lot after the first half hour and is consistently funny from there on. The audience always has the final say and Carry On Up The Jungle was just another in a long line of huge box office success. Recommended!",996364800,7,2214,4.694087403598972
