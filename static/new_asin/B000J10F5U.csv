8148334,3,B000J10F5U,"The Hay series and perspective on life is always timely, but the clothing, hair styles, and generalities in the piece were distracting from the message.

8148336,5,B000J10F5U,"The DVD ""Dissolving Barriers"" simply a recording of one of Louise's seminars. It was an amazing Seminar! Louise starts out sharing some knowledge on the subject the seminar was on (in this case the subject was barriers and why people hold themselves back without knowing why they do it), and then she answers questions that the audience has for her. I wish I could have been there to ask her questions! I recommend this DVD to everyone!",1283212800,2,436,4.675324675324675

8148341,5,B000J10F5U,"I first saw this video years ago when my life was in a shambles. Everything I thought I needed to know for successfull living was coming unraveled and I didn't know what to do about it. Enter Dissolving Barriers. When Louise asked people to express genuine love for themselves, something welled up within me that words simply cannot hope to explain. It was her message of focusing on loving oneself that set me on the path to wholeness. I now regularly and heartily recommend this video as well as Louise's other great inspirational materials to clients and friends.",1065484800,5,566,4.785714285714286
