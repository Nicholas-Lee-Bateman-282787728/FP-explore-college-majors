7805054,3,6300198308,"Oh dear, you definitely need to see this uncut! This film was released uncut in the UK briefly, but soon banned, and is now incredibly rare. It involves the stalking and murder of a group of holidaymakers in Greece by a  huge flesh eating man-beast. The film shambles along depicting murders on  board ships, in spooky villas and in caves, all without any suspense or  depth. It stars Tisa Farrow, sister of Mia, who looks vacant and vunerable  throughout (Is this intentional?) as well as Zora Kerova, star of several  Italian gore epics of the 80's. Nearly all characters succumb to the  monster's hungry advances, and the murder scenes are gruesome enough,  although the gore looks cheap and the foetus eating scene is hardly  convincing (mind you, he really seems to be taking a bite out of it,  whatever it is!). D'Amato even manages to introduce suspense in the final  few minutes as Tisa Farrow is attacked in a well, but its all too late, and  the final intestine-chewing death of the creature is laughable. Good  riddance, you may say, except that the monster appears again in the sequel  (entitled ""Absurd"" in the UK) which is actually much better, so  try and get that instead.",957744000,3,1188,4.7317073170731705
