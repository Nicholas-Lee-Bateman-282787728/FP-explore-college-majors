8048562,4,B0007LW2UI,"I'm a beginner and this dvd was very helpful.  I've been researching all over the internet and reading books, and wasn't really able to comprehend what I needed to do.  It's so much easier to understand when you see it being done.  The sections she covers are kinda short, and I think a little more should be covered - but I guess that's probably what the next volume would be for.  $30 is pretty pricey for what this dvd has - there should have been more to it, or at least come with a bead board or something.  I would like to see the next volume, but if it's for this price again I'll pass.",1142553600,21,593,4.121739130434783
