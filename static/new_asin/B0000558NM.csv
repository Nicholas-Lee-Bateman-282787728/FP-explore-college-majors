There were high hopes and great expectations for this film I remember...I was dissapointed... Everyone was. But hey..even Hollywood and it's 5 million dollar budgets make some pretty bad ones too...",1520035200,,315,4.543859649122807
7931080,1,B0000558NM,"Racial issues aside, it's a horrible movie with no strong storyline, no plot, and what was used to budget this movie was used to feature a rapper here and there. That should be a sign of trying to reach out to fans of these rappers so that you would watch. The same reason why Pun was on the movie poster. To put asses on seats because that would be the only way to get you to watch.  No good actors (go to imdb. If they have other credits its because only the director gave them a chance) and the writing is off.
Director/writer: go to film school, please.
Actors: take an acting classes. Don't think you have a natural talent. Even the best actors take a class here and there to perfect their craft.",1356739200,,701,4.231343283582089
7931081,1,B0000558NM,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Frankie Negron,I do wish he had a better role and different film. True I agree the with many reviewers,the director Val does not know much about Puerto Rican culture and feeds into the negative stereotypes and adds rap like Big Pun & Dmx etc..like we all listen to that music and making us look ghetto. Why not show a positive view of Puerto Ricans like hard working,going to school,arts etc..Instead we get a one side view,with bad acting,stereotypes,ghetto,bad directing etc..The plus side is good spanish music and Frankie Negron,but still that cant save the film. If you want to see good efforts watch ""West Side Story"",""I like it like that"",""Cayo"",""Nothing like the. Holidays"",""Blue Diner"",""Yo Soy Boricua""(Rosie Perez documentary),""El Cantante"" starring Jennifer Lopez(who does an Amazing job) in a story with complex family life of legendary Hector Lavoe with beautiful scenes of Puerto Rico and amazing music. Also, ""Yellow"" with Roselyn Sanchez. There are interesting stories,great efforts of Puerto Ricans,that do Not feed into the Negativity and actually tell an interesting story. Sorry,""Boricuas Bond"",you go in the ghetto negativity category with Mexican ganstas and cheap crappy films with no substance.",1320537600,,1259,5.331658291457287
7931082,4,B0000558NM,Well I came here looking for Rosie Perez's documentary from IFC on DVD but saw this and came because I remember seeing this movie in the theatre when it came out years ago. I am the type of person who is usually turned off by films that depict minorities in Hollywood- as for Puerto Ricans in particular- El Cantante- shame on J.Ho and Marc. Illegal Tender- being that it wasn't written or directed by a Puerto Rican it was okay- and outsiders view- but still nothing noteworthy. Yet I remember enjoying this film because although negative- it wasn't out of touch- as most are- growing up in a Puerto Rican ghetto I could relate to this film- it was a slightly exxagerated film about life in the ghetto but I could relate with Frankie's character in the film- for he was just out of luck- a kid who tried to get out and was offered this means to but was faced with issues that didn't allow him to so he just gave up (temporarily ?)- not positive but very real and possible- I would not be suprised or turned off if I met someone with the same type of story for it truly is real. How does the saying go- I know that this is wrong- but does art depict life or life depict art- this film I would say is more of art depicting life.,1194912000,,1227,4.203389830508475
7931083,4,B0000558NM,"People hate this movie, so I like it.  It is a great movie that I compare to ""Kids"".  I'm no movie critic, But I've been around people like in this movie.  I've been there with my friends and what not.  This movie unlike most shows the reality that a lot go through.  The music is tight, the characters r realistic and remind you of your peeps that u roll around with.  If John Leguizamo woulda been in this movie, it would have been an ace.  Bottom line is critics go nuts over kiddie movies and PG never going to happen movies.  tell me how many movies that show the everyday reality of people, gets good ratings?",1069632000,3,615,4.241379310344827
7931084,1,B0000558NM,"First off, I am an aspiring independent film director myself. When I had talked to consultants about my project, they told me never to write something that I didn't know anything about. Case and point, a Russian named Val Lik has decided to write and direct a film about Puerto Ricans, like myself, and failed miserably, because it's obvious he doesn't know what he's talking about.
This movie had little plot and I couldn't tell who the lead was from time to time. When reading the TV Guide review, it stated that a white kid was trying to survive in a Puerto Rican neighborhood. When I read the online review, it stated that a painter looked to do something better with his life besides crime and drugs and prostitution. So, what character are we supposed to follow? Not even Val Lik, who plays the white kid, knows who we are supposed to follow. Not to mention, Axel, an overweight Boricua, taking off his clothes any chance he gets to do so. If I had to see this kid's ass one more time, I was going to shoot myself.
Considering how weak his story was, he enlisted the help of hip-hoppers Big Pun, DMX, Method Man, Redman, and a few others, to try and earn him some credibility. It doesn't. Not to take anything away from any of these artists, but this outsider's look on Puerto Ricans in the inner city gives him no credibility and no chance of redemption in my eyes, regardless of who he casts in the film.",1064448000,4,1412,4.434615384615385
7931085,3,B0000558NM,it wasn't too unbearable. I must admit I watch it constantly but only because of Frankie Negron's sexy self. If not for Frankie I'd probably rate it a 1.,1052352000,,153,4.310344827586207
7931086,1,B0000558NM,Whatever you do not buy or rent this movie. It is yet another ignorant portrayal of Puerto Rican reality done by some outsider...do not support this movie.,1033776000,6,155,4.777777777777778
7931087,4,B0000558NM,"Kinda of confusing, but I'm from the area, so I have to show love.  It's a cool video though...there are alot of funny moments so it's worth it.",1033603200,,144,4.142857142857143
