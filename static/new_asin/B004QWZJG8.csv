8438581,3,B004QWZJG8,Good tricks but the performer could slow down the instruction a bit. He is great at teaching the basic moves but tends to speed thru the explanations. It is worth the purchase or rental fee. I will learn a lot after watching this a few times. The video quality is why I gave a 3 star review otherwise i would give 4 stars,1456012800,,321,4.111111111111111
8438582,2,B004QWZJG8,"Well, I have no idea why you'd ever buy this for 20 bucks, when for 13 bucks you have have Gerry Griffin's CD containing about 30 times the amount of tricks and info, honestly.

Don't get me wrong... Van Doren seems like a nice enough fellow, and the DVD is kind o fun.  But just watch it on Amazon Instant for a few bucks one time, it's really enough to just enjoy his show.

Its a pretty shoddy learning tool, though.",1449360000,,419,4.148148148148148
8438583,4,B004QWZJG8,"This is a good DVD for anyone looking to ""step up"" from self-working card tricks to easy sleight of hand.  The DVD begins with a live performance of a professional card routine.  The routine consists of six tricks that are fairly well-known among card magicians (e.g. a variation of ""The Chicago Opener"", the Biddle trick, card to card box, etc.).  After the performance, all of the necessary sleights (e.g. double lift, double undercut, biddle count, etc.) are taught.  Then, the actual tricks are explained.  This is obviously not as comprehensive as any of the multi-DVD sets of ""The Royal Road to Card Magic"" (also recommended) but nevertheless, a good introduction to modern sleight of hand card magic.",1390608000,,707,5.0085470085470085
8438584,1,B004QWZJG8,"I rented this one for my kid who likes watching shows about magic. It was about like watching paint dry. The magician is talented enough, so the first part where he goes through his act wasn't terrible. But (IMO) you can just turn it off after that. If you're interested in shows like this though and you have FIOS, there are some nice shows on MagRack (On-Demand section in with the free channels) --> Magic with ""Justin Credible"" which are both entertaining and educational. There's also another set of shows in the same area (which I can't recall the name of) that my kid likes. Both are much more entertaining than this one.",1359849600,,628,4.566371681415929
8438585,5,B004QWZJG8,"Some great tricks here, some good introductory sleights. A very good primer on card magic and a simply great price.  The host of the video does a more than adequate job introducing some basic ideas in card magic, and prefaces his instruction with an actual performance for friends and family, which is in itself very, very good.

It is ""beginner"" stuff, but not for little kids.",1358208000,,378,4.712121212121212
