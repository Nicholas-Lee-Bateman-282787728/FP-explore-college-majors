8514432,5,B007CBX548,"This is a great film with a great script. I'm not usually into zombie comedies but how is this film not more famous?

Yes its a bit rough around the edges but its got a great script with a great sense of humor. Reminds me of cult films like Repo Man and Cemetary Man. If you're into films with a built-in sense of nostalgia then please find a way to see this one.

Just go on wikipedia and check how many horror and fantasy festivals this film has played at and check out the awards its received at them. My guess is that the director/producer made it without a distributor on board and then later none of them will touch it like it has a plague.

Why do great films like this just go undistributed and unnoticed?",1339804800,3,713,4.189781021897811
8514433,1,B007CBX548,"Fortget about the cool poster above, this movie is no where near a good or entertaining film !!

the whole concept was ridiculous and silly, it involves a soldier named Bart who dies in Iraq and is brought to the states for his funereal, we are soon indtrodcued to a very annoying character named Joey played by an equally annoying actor Chris Wylde, who is bart's best friend and buddy, we find him giving support to Bart's girlfriend and easing her grief. only to end up sleeping with her ! some friend !!

Well, Brat some how comes back to life as an undead, a Zombie, but he retains all his human brain activity, think Death becomes her 1992, and soon the two buddies are united and embark every night into action as a dynamic vigilantes who hunt and kill bad guys, and then eath them !!

one might think, the action and scenes might actually be funny or cool, but trust me, its not,  rather a very annoying and slow paced plot, and the action is very minimal.

the film fails in being both a commedy or a Horror, just unbalanced.

the acting was mediocre, and the plot was very shallow, lacking any meaning or goal.
no wonder there isn't a U.S format for this film.

if you want a some what similar, but far more superior film, just go back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Becomes-Her/dp/0783225482/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Becomes Her</a>&nbsp;with Bruce Willis and Meryl Streep !!",1335744000,,1447,4.905737704918033

Bart is clearly dead, but clearly alive with full brain function so is not your typical zombie, he also is completely dead during daylight hours only to reanimate at sunset, wich is conveniant enough for the boys to live a party lifestyle.
While out one night they stumble into an armed robbery and bart is shot, realising being a zombie comes with the perk of being invinsible and seeing as Bart needs to drink blood to continue to servive decides to be a vigilante style superhero with Joey the happy side kick.
Great to be watched in companion with Dead Heads, great laughs and a new perspective on the zombie landscape, a much needed reinvention",1333756800,7,748,4.58955223880597
8514435,4,B007CBX548,"This is a genre splicing film from Wanko Toys Productions, and that has to be the best production name ever. It links the `Death Wish' revenge theme with the undead zombie theme. The basic synopsis is our hero Bart (David Anders) is killed on active duty in Iraq. His body is repatriated and a grieving girlfriend and best mate bury him. The preacher is one of those full on sanctimonious Bible bashers that insinuates that Bart may not have embraced the Lord enough in life to be welcomed through the Pearly gates, so we should all take note. This gets best mate Joey (Chris Wylde) thinking if his best friend may actually have gone to Hell.

Well he needn't have fretted, as later that night he gets a knock at the door and a voice from the past calls out. Yes you guessed right, Bart has returned, and after some initial scepticism Joey takes in his old mate, but he soon has to make a trip to the Emergency Room after Bart finds he can't process normal food, the penny finally drops when the Hospital goes mental at the thought of the living dead. After some inter web research Joey realises he is neither Vampire nor Zombie, so they decide he is a Revenant - from the French for one who has come back after a long time, often from the assumed dead.

Then they get mugged and after a tussle they realise that Bart can have a steady food supply and do society some good by killing criminals and homeless and drug dealers and just about anyone that they consider bad.

This is billed as a riotous comedy and it does have some very dark humour but not belly laugh stuff, the gore is pretty full on though. The actual story is the real strength, and the twists are far from obvious or sign posted. I agree this is to be feted as a cult classic very soon, but 'Dead Heads' is way funnier, this though has more pathos, and much better make up. There is also a great homage to `Dirty Harry' which you have to see. I really enjoyed this great film but needs viewing caution as we have some so called `strong language' and lots of gore/violence and loads of shooting.

This is not a full on Zombie fest but it is a new take on the subject and I prefer a sentient Zombie to the slow walking drooling sort that is the norm, this also plays it straight despite the humour, it is not camped up like say `Gory Gory Hallelujah', which I also liked. This also has some lovely touches like the roaches in the apartment and the great Camaro that Joey drives, if you like your zombie movies fresh then look no further.",1333584000,17,2503,4.319148936170213
