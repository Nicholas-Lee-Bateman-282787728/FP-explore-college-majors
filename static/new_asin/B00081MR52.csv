8055267,4,B00081MR52,"The good news is that, via DVD, we can see a long-unavailable W.C. Fields silent comedy from 1926 that happens to co-star the alluring Louise Brooks. The bad news? They recorded it at silent speed. Silent speed versus sound speed has been a long-running debate and bone of contention among silent film enthusiasts and scholars. Many hold fast to the notion that anything filmed at 18 fps should be shown at that speed. Others say that as cameramen standardized cranking speeds, projection speeds were no longer required to slow down to compensate for undercranked film, and there are film leaders that bear this out, instructing projectionists to set their rheostats at speeds of 20 fps or higher. Comedies benefited from slightly higher speeds that gave them a brisker pace and larger-than-life speed in the chase scenes. Certain dramas, like Lon Chaney's ""Phantom of the Opera,"" bore instructions for slower projection. Ironically, most video copies of ""Phantom"" were mastered at sound speed.

""It's the Old Army Game"" is listed in most books as running at 72 to 74 minutes. This copy comes in at 104 minutes. I find this problematic for this feature. Fields, as druggist Elmer Prettywillie, spends the film re-creating several stage routines that later found their way into sound movies including ""The Barber Shop,"" ""The Pharmacist,"" and ""It's a Gift."" In this particular movie, they are played broadly, with little subtlety. At silent speed, they feel drawn-out and labored. At sound speed, they at least regain some of the larger-than-life satire they must have possessed onstage. If your DVD player has multiple fast-forward settings, you can run the movie at 1 1/2 speed at achieve a running time of just about 72 minutes. Unfortunately, this makes Keith Taylor's piano score unlistenable.

As for the movie, W.C. Fields is just about the whole show. The story makes a few arbitrary twists and turns to generate some drama and provide a love story for Louise Brooks, whose good looks are more distraction than support for Fields' comedy. The scenes, which are all dry-runs for the later sound versions, are played with a certain savagery that is sometimes shocking, sometimes hilarious. Overall, their timing (and the overall movie) doesn't quite jibe, but it's still entertaining to see Fields at work, molding an screen version of his stage persona.

The image is good to very good, occasionally a bit light with some barely noticeable surface scratches throughout. Keith Taylor's piano score is spare and serviceable and should be played if you run the movie at silent speed. I'd love to hear what Robert Israel or Ben Model might do with this movie at sound speed.

Whichever speed you choose, it's wonderful to see Fields as a character-in-progress in this movie.",1367193600,12,2775,5.0524017467248905

Mr. Prettywillie, the Druggist of the small midwestern town, can't seem to get any rest. When he's not woken up by an hysterical high-society lady (played well by Dale Fuller, the triple-jointed ""patient"" in The Dentist; she shows up later on, apprently exhausted by the walk to the mailbox, and it seems her dress refuses to stay in place, and she transforms from the upper crust socialite to the flapper) who must have have a single stamp right now, or by a neighbor's infant just doing what an infant will do, or by various delivery men who dare to make a sound while Fields sleeps on a hammock on the backporch, he's beleaguered by the normal walk-in traffic, who have an eye on Louise Brooks, the pretty assistant who falls for a Real Estate man with a surefire plan.
He's even tormented at a distance by the Aunt of Louise, who cannot contain her crush on her neice's employer; he must feign appreciation as a courtesy to his employee.
There's a very long scene with Fields and co. picnicing on the lawn of a great estate - Fields does some wonderful pantomine but the whole segment could have been excised for a two-reeler. Also, it has no bearing on the plot at all.
The soundtrack was performed and recorded live and some of the non-musical ambience bleeds through.
This reasonably priced DVD is a great companion to the rare ""You're Telling Me"", from 1934.",1221004800,13,1604,4.671378091872792
