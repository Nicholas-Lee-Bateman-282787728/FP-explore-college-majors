7946994,3,B00005NFZ8,"Not the greatest of thrillers from the description i read when i first considered buying this movie, the cover sleeve got my attention first. However it was a decent purchase, not a bad movie with some cool twists and good looking ladies. Worth it.",1371772800,3,248,4.659090909090909
7946995,3,B00005NFZ8,"This film is a thriller with a twist. The picture on the box has absolutely nothing to do with the film's story line. Its a story of how a woman and her boyfriend conspire to kill the anal retentive husband of her friend. Of course theres a plot twist. But this film by no means is sleazy, like it's cover. And speaking of the cover....who are these women? They're not in the film.",1011312000,31,381,4.232876712328767
