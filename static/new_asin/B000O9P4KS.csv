8184085,5,B000O9P4KS,"This VHS is certainly a collector's item for one lucky Amazon buyer, but if it isn't you, don't despair. This remarkable movie is available elsewhere on the web. It streams constantly and affordably.",1483920000,,199,5.0606060606060606
8184086,5,B000O9P4KS,this movie is hysterical especially the part where the narrator and star of the movie talks about a filthy old man he picked up one time. i never laughed my ass off as hard!,1440288000,,173,4.117647058823529
8184087,1,B000O9P4KS,Really poor quality. Lots of dropouts on VHS copy. Price too high. Lighting poor too.,1418601600,,85,4.733333333333333
8184088,1,B000O9P4KS,"This is one of the best documentaries ever made. I have been trying to find a copy of this movie for years. I was so excited that it was available at Amazon.com, I sat down to order it and I was totally deflated when I saw the price.  I can't afford $79.99! It's not cool to charge so much.",1395273600,,290,3.9152542372881354
8184089,5,B000O9P4KS,"This is undeniably one of the funniest memoirs in the world, but it's only available in this format . Jeffrey Strouth should have had this transcribed and published. Alas, he is only one of many whose life has ended too soon, but at least he left this documentary so that he will be remembered! If the owners of the rights to this docu-comedy would get it on DVD it could reach an entirely new audience!",1334448000,,403,4.386666666666667
8184090,5,B000O9P4KS,"As someone who knew Jeffrey from his teens, I can attest to the veracity of these stories. What was often tragic, occasionally funny, or even of only passing interest in life somehow always seemed funnier and more dramatic when Jeffrey got involved or related the story. He had a way. I only wish all the OTHER great Jeffrey stories could be told. RIP Jeffrey. You were one of a kind and are missed. Somewhere there's a red Pinto looking for you...

I'm glad this part of Jeffrey survives and that he entertains yet today, almost 20 years since his passing, so others can have the joy of knowing Jeffrey. And yes, he was as 'bigger than life' as he seems.

I describe this movie to the unknowing as a sort of stand-up comedian's act, but more of a sit-in-the-back-of-a-classic-car-being-driven-around-while-drinking act.",1298937600,4,820,4.85
8184091,5,B000O9P4KS,Gay folklore and the art of story telling live in in Jeffery. Funny and moving.,1255478400,,79,4.333333333333333
8184092,5,B000O9P4KS,"I love this documentary!  While riding in the back seat of a black '50's cadillac, Jeffrey Strouth recounts his life growing up gay in a white trash Southern setting, tossing down shots of whiskey.  As the liquor takes effect, the stories get crazier and darker, yet completely believable.  Jeffrey charges into situations most would try to avoid.
  He recounts his life up through the 80's club scene, offering a timecapsule of life in the drug-crazed fast lane.  Although he must know he's dying, Jeffrey keeps his chin up and the tales have a bittersweet edge revealing his sweet, caring nature underneath it all.",1243900800,3,616,4.932038834951456
