5523054,1,B00AWGBGMI,"I rented this movie because it had four stars and I wonder what kind of human being would give it this rating!  The acting was horrible, the scenes were disgusting (worse than Texas Chain Saw Massacre) and the story line was downright stupid.

Lesson learned:  Do not believe the ratings since they are obviously completely unreliable!

This is worth a refund...",1370476800,,362,4.885245901639344

5523056,1,B00AWGBGMI,"I'm thinking the other reviews had to be written by the cast and crew! Audio is horrible - actually had to use close captioning.  Acting is mediocre at beast.  The entire movie seems to have been made by film students on an iphone.  The plot not only emulates every other horror movie in creation,  - but has so many holes that it would be comical if you could hear it.  Why do the characters immediately think that the person chasing them is some supernatural entity?  Further, why do they all instantly separate upon witnessing it?  Are they trying to create one long stream of horror clich&eacute;s?  I am guessing that the creators saw texas chainsaw and grave encounters and set out on a mission to combine the two in a corny poorly made ""indie film.""  In the future I suggest that they use their iphones solely to make phone calls.  A for effort but someone really needs to fix the audio.",1368489600,6,894,4.496894409937888
5523057,4,B00AWGBGMI,"Horror movies and I usually don't get along, but it was obvious in this one when the major gore was going to begin, so I hid my eyes during the last part.",1367020800,2,154,3.84375
5523058,5,B00AWGBGMI,"I loved ""Animus"" a great indie horror film.  The acting really accentuated the amazing camera work.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and it definitely gives you all the blood and guts you could want.",1366675200,2,211,4.25
5523059,5,B00AWGBGMI,"This is a true independent horror film with great special effects.  It has good acting, good camera work and is reminiscent of the classic 80's  horror films. Even with the small budget, I had a lot of fun with it.",1365897600,,214,4.325
5523060,1,B00AWGBGMI,"A clueless group of youths (is there any other kind?) traipse off to an abandoned psychiatric hospital (how original!) to investigate possible ghost infestation.  Instead, they encounter a Hills Have Eyes reject with nasey teeth and a really bad anger management problem.  Ho hum....you've seen it all before and there's nothing particularly original to distinguish this half-baked Indie.  Why can't it be five octogenarians trapped in an abandoned nursing home?  Or birdwatchers accosted by parakeets?  ANYTHING fresh would be heartily welcome!",1365292800,8,545,5.679012345679013

5523073,5,B00AWGBGMI,"John Bernath is one of the best at playing creepy monsters and this was a good one - just the good kind of scare you expect from a good horror flick!  Really liked this one, I mean you know it's not real right?  But this guy scared the bejeezes out of me!!  Other reviewers have mentioned sound quality but that wasn't an issue for me with the DVD; maybe streaming is different?  I dunno, I'm not techie - I just know what I like!  Get it.  Watch it.  But maybe not alone.  Oh, and leave the lights on!",1440374400,,502,4.051020408163265

5523076,3,B00AWGBGMI,"Maya, (Megan Davis) a student and Thorazine junkie is doing a film for her nonfiction film class. She loads up the van with her friends and not her ex-bf Brad (Trinidad Amaya) and heads out to Copper Queen hospital in remote Arizona. Here they have a hospital which experimented on children as we get the story told to us by an elderly woman, the low point in the film. Once the crew gets to the hospital creepy things happen and it turns into a screaming senseless gore fest.

The film seemed slow to develop. The driving scene proved to be a waste of dialog. Once they get inside, the film becomes a combination of hand held cameras and badly shot scenes from the worse angels...like Russian porn. Room for improvement.

I had no issue with sound. In fact I had to turn mine down.

5523077,3,B00AWGBGMI,"Animus is a low budget horror flick with a Michael Meyers/Jason Voorhees type bad guy. The flick is very slow, but the final act of the flick is very intense and pays off.",1387238400,2,171,4.212121212121212
5523078,4,B00AWGBGMI,"there's potential here. sure, the movie's flawed, but the tension, lighting, and effects...those are right up there with some of the bigger-budget flicks they show on fearnet or chillerbetter even because they were real, not cgi. the sound and plot could have used a little help, but i was along for the ride so that didn't bother me too much. considering this was this guy's first movie as a director (according to imdb), he's off to a decent start. i'll definitely check out his next one if he makes another.",1376265600,2,510,4.677777777777778
