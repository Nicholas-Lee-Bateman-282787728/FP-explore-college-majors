3803653,5,B001URA5RK,"""A six lesson study packed with thought-provoking truth.""

Twisting the Truth by Andy Stanley is a must for those looking to expose deception in our present day culture. We are so molded by what is now so acceptable, so tolerated, and sadly even promoted. We do not realize the devastation of buying into the lies of the enemy.

I purchased the participant guide to use with the Group Curriculum DVD in my next Bible Study. As with all of Andy Stanley's teachings, I was not disappointed.

This study focused on topics not often discussed in depth such as the truth about authority, the correct view of sex, and all woven back to the central theme of deception.

Thought provoking character skits introduce each weeks session prompting the viewer to focus on the various levels of deception and the often overlooked result. These skits reminded me of C. S. Lewis' `Screwtape Letters' because of the view inside the enemy's camp.

The discussion questions are on point and very useful in igniting discussion and conversation. This is my favorite portion of the guide.  We cannot deal with a thing until it is first recognized in light of what God tells us then discussed openly to put to rest all the questions a small group has.

I recommend this highly as well as the DVD  Group Curriculum.

8344766,5,B001URA5RK,"This is the second book that I have chosen to read from Andy Stanley's works.  Andy's gift is the ability to reach the unchurched. And in that I mean he has the insight to help us apply God's truth into our lives as we journey here on this planet.  In this work Andy exposes the way Satan works his will on this earth.  Andy uses every day situations that we face each day and in our unaware state of mind we accept this situations as normal or the way it is.  When in reality they are lies. We accept these lies as the truth and they are far from God's Truth.  If you are not a christian or in any way do not believe in God or what His word says in how we are to live and love each other, this may be a difficult read.  But if you are searching for the right way to live, and the way you have been living is not working for you, then I would recommend this book and the dvd that goes with it.  If you are a seeker, this is a good place to begin your new journey.",1365120000,,963,3.8333333333333335
