1206550,4,B00000FA91,"This film contains several great twists and displays a truly talented side of Ryan Reynolds in which I would like to see more of.  The soundtrack was excellent, paring the right music at the right moment and pulling you into the character's anguish.  The only thing keeping me from giving this film five stars was the beginning of the movie.  It didn't hook me until about 25 minutes in, and then I wished it didn't end.  The supporting cast was excellent, and Reynolds' character brings an appropriate amount of comic relief mixed with his unraveling.",1213747200,24,552,4.778947368421052

1206726,4,B00000FA91,"Chaos Theory was an interesting movie. A drama the likes of which is out of character for Ryan Reynolds, yet he's able to pull the role off quite convincingly. The film really elaborates on the hypocrisies of life and relationships with a comical solution on Reynolds' part. A shallow movie with only decent acting by the supporting cast that allows it to maintain a roughly true to life quality. While I enjoyed watching it, I definitely do not believe seven years after it's release that it's worth $20 dollars. I purchased it for $11.73 and still feel the price was high even with the inclusion of a double sided disk (Side A Widescreen/Side B Fullscreen).

1206843,4,B00000FA91,"I did poorly in my single college logic class. So why does it seem that I've found only one other reference to a problem with the hinge of this film's primary plot device?  Frank's wife, hoping to give him more time to start his day, catch his ferry to work, and return the rented videos, sets the kitchen clock AHEAD.

This is not made explicit in scenes where it happens, but is alluded to.  When he gets to the convention and concludes his speech he hits the hotel bar and is met by his friend Buddy. Buddy asks what's wrong.  Paraphrasing the important here...

Frank:
""Susan.... she get's all over me about my schedule, she sets the clocks FORWARD to give me more time only she gives me less time because I miss the ferry......""

This could not have been excused a minor mistake in Franks thinking at the moment because his friend Buddy responds with...

""She actually set the clock forward?""

Frank responds.  ""Actually set the clock forward"".

It only takes a moment to see the problem here (beyond that Frank says ""clocks"" but all other references in the movie are singular), but the writers, actors, crew, and millions of viewers seem to have just accepted the logic of it without question.

Susan sets the kitchen clock 10 minutes AHEAD. So if she moved the kitchen clock from 7:05 to 7:15 what does Frank's watch read?  Correct. 7:05.  Kitchen clock is 10 minutes AHEAD of Frank's watch, not behind it.  So at the moment of realization when Frank looks at his watch in panic, instead of howling about missing his ferry he should calm down and realize that he now, as Susan planned, has 13 more minutes to leave the house!

Once I just accepted the idea being proposed instead of the flaw in the writing it turned out to be a fairly enjoyable film although I would not watch it a second time.",1386201600,,1802,4.501538461538462

Ryan Reynolds gives a great performance as well as Stuart Townsend as the sleezy, flirtatious, husband's best friend that likes to put the moves on his best friend's wife.  I had several good laughs watching this movie and was surprised it went under the radar--or perhaps it's because I don't watch commercials anymore ever since the DVR was invented!

1206846,3,B00000FA91,"This movie is well-written, and the title fits the story.  Ryan Reynolds is fun to watch, as he is beautiful and extremely talented--I hope he goes beyond those quirky, funny guy roles and finds opportunities that showcase his chops.  The little girl in this movie is also very talented, and is gorgeous.  But the casting fell short.  I hated Emily Mortimer as the wife.  She is awkward to watch, especially in this movie.  I also get annoyed at actors whose accents come out frequently (Catherine Zeta Jones, Minnie Driver--when they play Americans), as hers does.  Not only is Mortimer uncomfortable as RyRen's wife, her character is despicable and completely unlikeable.  You'd think they could have cast an actress who could capture a sensitive situation as hers was, but still be able to touch the audience.  Overall, worth a watch.",1370908800,,837,4.9640287769784175

1206848,2,B00000FA91,"I wanted to like this movie.  This type of character is perfect for Ryan Reynolds and the movie had the makings (according to the other reviews I read) of being one of those low budget dark-comedy gems that turns out to be unexpectedly good.

It wasn't.

--NO SPOILER REVIEW--

We are all different people with differing opinions, but I cannot see where anyone would give this movie 5 out of 5 stars; even 4 is a stretch.  The acting in this movie is average AT BEST, the flow of the plot lines are jagged, the situations depicted were almost always unrealistic, and the movie had no idea what it wanted to be.  A comedy?  A dark comedy?  A drama?  A dram-edy?

Listen: Not Ryan Reynolds' best movie and this is one of those movies that if you have very few other options in place for your viewing pleasure, you can watch this movie and not think it an absolute waste of your life if you do.  Wanted to give it 2.5 out of 5, but since I can't, had to round down once I started thinking about it again.

--SPOILERS REVIEW--

Okay, this movie essentially kicks off by their group of friends talking about what they've named their penises, but more painstakingly unfortunate, every one of them, in fact, has a name for theirs.  What?  The main female character then goes on to exclaim she wants a husband for a New Year's resolution and she will pick from her friends (using sound reasoning only existing in the movies, mind you). About a minute or so later you get the impression Ryan Reynolds was her choice all along, but that doesn't stop this from feeling gimmicky from the start or written by a 10 year old.

Fast-forward a bit and Ryan Reynolds' life starts falling apart as soon as he's late for the ferry.  Now, I'm no expert on the ways and means of aquatic-transportation, but the worker not letting him on the ferry is absolute crap.  There is no one else waiting, they haven't pulled up the ramps yet, and the next ferry doesn't leave for another HOUR, there is NO REASON they couldn't let this ONE GUY aboard the ferry.  A minor discrepancy, yes, but to base the start of the premise on this is, again, written by a 10 year old.

This movie is 1hr 27m 48s long (roughly) and there are two distinct parts where they spend way too much time on something that has nothing to do with the overall arch of the story.  1) When he's driving the pregnant woman to the hospital, we get the pleasure of spending almost 3+ minutes inside the car while he tells her to breath?  Wow.  2) Then, when he finds out he's sterile, we get another 3+ minutes of him sitting by the river half crying/vomiting/gagging.  In a 90-minute movie, you can't have 6'ish minutes of nothing.

Also, he's angry at his wife because she accidentally set the clock ahead 10 minutes, making him late, and this eventually causes him to have drinks and flirt with a hot blonde, ultimately winding up in his room with her almost naked?  Again...what?  Where on earth would a HAPPILY married man with a young daughter wind up in bed with another female, with his friend present at the bar (a friend who openly flirts with his wife, mind you).  It doesn't matter nothing ultimately happens, and he ultimately rejects her, doesn't matter he had been drinking, IT DOES NOT MATTER, this is so cliche and undermining I took an entire star off of my review for that.

Some other points: The nurse's phone call and how professional it was, their fight when he first gets home after delivering the pregnant woman to the hospital (no chance of explaining himself, we just go right into the cliche ""you're the devil, get out forever!""), Buddy's speech when he tries to convince the wife he loves her and he wants to raise ""his"" daughter...was some of the worst dialogue in the movie (Buddy's character development up to this point...he might as well be wallpaper).  And how did the pregnant woman find out where he lived anyway if she left the hospital?  Magic?

Also, the wife sleeps with Buddy (the best friend of the guy she chooses) less than a week before choosing her husband?  What?  And her defense of this is ""But it was only you after, promise!""  And another thing, at the beginning of the movie, the groom has cold feet because his fiance, during a momentary break-up, sleeps with another guy for 2 weeks?  And his friend is convincing him this is normal and he's lucky?  That dude needs new friends and definitely a new bride.

I'll stop there before my head explodes.",1365379200,,4440,4.496878901373283

1206850,3,B00000FA91,"This is an okay movie. Efficiency expert Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds) makes lots of lists. He has time scheduled, planned, parsed, and pigeonholed. Then one day he is 10 minutes late to a speech (his wife adjusted the clock) and it sets off a chain of events that changes his life. He lets a woman from the audience use the bathroom in his hotel room and when his wife calls she suspects he is cheating on her. Then he helps an expectant mother and is confused for the father.

I feel a connection to the main character because of his habits. He keeps index cards of to-do lists and I like to write down important errands and events to keep track of them. He leaves for work at exactly 7:18 and I like to set my alarm clock for atypical times to squeeze in a little more sleep. A key part of the movie involves finding out who the biological father of a 7-year-old girl is and it would be very upsetting if a man found out a child he had raised wasn't his.",1359849600,,955,4.190217391304348

This movie actually has some awesome one-liners in it that you will find yourself repeating!  This would have been a 5 star review except for a number of scenes which dragged on slowly.  The other scenes had so much action and so many surprises that Chaos Theory definitely rates 4 stars!  Ryan Reynolds' acting is superior as his character, a time-control freak, discovers that control really is an illusion.  As he carefully makes lists for each day so as not to waste precious time, being late for a ferry begins a ripple in time that exposes life-changing secrets and movie twists! (sorry, I can't give away any secrets here!)  It's a fun ride, DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING.  I highly recommend this movie!",1344470400,,801,4.678571428571429

Basically the movie is a life story of the father of the bride, who was sharing it with his future son-in-law. It would be a great watch for young people and for adults too. It's not a comedy, though a good story that make you think about human nature.",1341273600,,558,4.214953271028038

1206912,3,B00000FA91,"A couple of years ago, a movie called ""Chaos Theory"" was recommended to me but I couldn't find it at the library or in the catalogs. I found this one from Canada on Amazon.com, and I think this 2008 release, which stars Ryan Reynolds, is the one my friend had in mind.

Filmed during Reynolds' steady ascent to A-List status, he flawlessly inhabits a character who is more than a little ADD. This guy is a time-management expert who has a successful career as an author and a lecturer. His wife has a more cavalier attitude about time, consequently she causes him to miss his ferry ride, which sets off a series of events which irrevocably change their lives.

Here are the principal players:

  * Ryan Reynolds (""The Proposal"" and ""Green Lantern"") is our overly organized maker of lists. By the time he embraces chaos, he is seriously off track.
  * Emily Mortimer (""Match Point"" and ""Lars and the Real Girl"") is his impatient wife. She would like more spontaneity in their marriage.
  * Stuart Townsend (""The Best Man"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") is a long-time friend of both.
  * Matreya Fedor (lots of TV) is their nine-year-old daughter...smile...

By the time our hero buys a shotgun, I was actively involved in this script and had my fingers crossed. There are no bad guys here, although I really WANTED to dislike one or two...for awhile, anyway....",1317945600,,1375,4.73109243697479
1206913,5,B00000FA91,"A young man is about to get married to Jesse (Elisabeth Harnois.) He is getting second thoughts about taking the plunge. He is cornered by the bride's father Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds) on the way to the exit. And here the groom is told in detail and an extensive flashback how the chaos theory works (or not.)

The essence of the story starts with a wife setting a clock off 10 minutes trying to give her well organized husband an extra 10 minutes but inadvertently loses 10 minutes and it snowballs into chaos. I will not go through the many details as the surprise twists are what give value to this story. However the father explains that you cannot plan on events, but you can choose to love.

With some of the almost slapstick actions and not likely events I can see how someone would take this as a comedy. At least this has a fresher formula that all those girl meets, guy misunderstands guy, later realizes mistake and they go off happily ever after stories.

I would say that it is at least worth watching so that you can make your own decision as to whether this presentation was worth the effort. For me I'm still not too sure.",1314576000,,1139,4.414285714285715
1206914,5,B00000FA91,"In two words, this film can be described as suprising and compelling.

I ran across this film while browsing Netflix through my PS3. The plot sounded pretty funny, so I took a shot.

First impression - whoa, this is not a comedy - but even though it didn't meet my immediate expectations, Reynold's character was very compelling (me being the same sort of straight-laced OCD personality, I almost immediately developed a strong sympathy for Reynolds).

I've never been a big fan of Reynolds - I always envisioned him the ""Van Wilder"" type, and never really cared to give any of his films an honest break. But between the likeable character design and Reynold's fantastic portrayal, my heart actually broke for the poor guy during the progression of the plot. I should make a correction - I WASN'T a fan, but his performances was strong enough to convince me to give some of his other projects a go.

The supporting cast is also very solid - no A-listers, but all genuine in their roles. The plot is the most unexpected part of the whole experience. Despite the dark-edginess of the story and the contemporary amorality of the film industry, Chaos Theory is surprisingly moral and grounded in traditional values. There is no edgy perversion, no cynical mockery of straight-laced Frank Allen his normal family, there's no sex on camera, profanity is realistic, and all of the characters, for all of their failings, are just good people who want to do the right thing. All in all, it's a lesson in the sometimes catastrophic consequences to seemingly minor events (the chaos theory), but in the end, you choose how you live with it.

On the technical side, I appreciated the use slow pans and long cuts, it really forces a performance from the actors, and forces the audience to maintain that connection. When compared the modern immature rapid-cut preference in film editing, it made it much more personal. The location, which looks like up near Vancouver, fits the plot well: beautiful, cold, and somber. It's not Avatar, nor is it Casablanca, but still well executed.

I enjoyed this film so much, I watched it again the very next night, and I'm now buying it. Highly recommended.",1309219200,2,2180,4.815508021390374
1206915,5,B00000FA91,"Until I watched this film it seemed to me that Ryan Reynolds played himself in all of the films of his that I have seen. There were variations of course. The Proposal was different than Blade 3 but the underlying ... portrayal was the same at it's core. I really enjoy that portrayal because he makes me laugh. He has made me laugh in Two guys, a girl and a pizza place; Foolproof; Just Friends; The In-Laws; Definitely, Maybe and Van Wilder. An outstanding comedic actor.

This film, as well as his others, Buried and Smokin Aces (A film that I don't recommend for anything other than Reynold's and Jeremy Piven's performances), shows just what kind of range this man can show us. When he gets the news that his life is built on a lie and he takes that hit emotionally... I never doubted his reaction. Totally believable how he responds to what he perceives, rightfully so, as the destruction of his world and his attempts to find any kind of meaningful path to get through that chaos are such that you could not help but feel his pain even though he didn't say a word on the drive back from the revelation.

Not to say that there is no humor, there is, or that the other people in this movie aren't excellent, they are. Watch it for yourself and make your own decisions.",1305158400,,1272,4.408510638297872

The hair styles and makeup helps to show the different ages but his mannerisms just takes it over the top. The plot summary describes the main character as ""an obsessively organized efficiency expert"". This sounds like a nerd which is visually supported by the DVD cover where he is wearing horn-rimmed glasses. The movies I've seen him in he is far from that thus causing my need to see the movie!

I don't want to give anything away, but a cascade of events changes Frank forever.  He learns about himself, his daughter's parentage, his best friend's history, and more.

Ryan Reynolds is well cast as a well-meaning but excitement-shunning man.  When he comes out of his shell, it is a tempered but determined emergence, which gives the plot more credibility.

Chaos Theory was fun to watch.  Make sure you go beyond the ""5-minute"" test... you'll need at least 15 minutes to catch this wave.",1294531200,2,802,4.932835820895522

I was pleased to find it for a reasonable price online. None of the stores in our area had it in stock. Chaos Theory has a good mix of humor--that isn't all slapstick--and a decent story to follow. All in all, it's a good flick to watch on a date night or with friends, and it's one worth watching again.",1293408000,10,444,4.114942528735632
1206980,4,B00000FA91,"It's not exactly North by Northwest, but this is a solid, fun film.  Unlike most romantic comedies, the writing is actually pretty good.  There were a bunch of really clever lines, and no real groaners that I can think of.

Two things bothered me about it.  It really celebrates the concept of heterosexual marriage and monogamy as the way to go.  It doesn't really question any of that.  Lots of people are happy not being married, or being non-monogamous, and certainly not everyone is straight.  So it's a little bit of a bummer, Yet-Another-Movie-About-Straight-White-People-Getting-Married-And-Being-Monogamous.  Like we really need another one of those.

And also, somewhat it sets up the wife as the villain for a lot of the movie, which is another sad trope.  Poor-Perfect-Man-With-Overreactive-Wife is a little played out as a movie theme.

Other than those two things, I enjoyed it quite a bit though.",1271116800,,911,5.171232876712328

1206982,3,B00000FA91,"This movie is definitely a dark comedy -- as some of the other reviews reveal, Ryan Reynold's character has everything go miserably wrong in his life.  The irony is that he is an efficiency expert and, prior to this series of events, had an inordinately structured and ""perfect"" existence.  When it shatters apart, he begins doing the some of the risky behavior he once condemned (driving a Harley with no helmet) and smoking.  You can feel the tension because his actions go against his personality.  Throughout, Reynolds is very convincing in dramatizing the stress and anxiety.

Just watching the film, I could not help but feel very empathetic toward Reynold's character.  To me, it isn't really all that ""laugh-out-loud"" funny.  Rather, it is more of a sense of shock that the poor guy has been devastated so badly and deeply.

While I normally don't like this kind of movie, I felt it was strangely compelling and well done for what it is.  Just don't watch this for some light-hearted laughs.",1266537600,14,999,4.829411764705882
1206983,4,B00000FA91,"I really liked this movie because it is an interesting way to see one's entire life as a series of comedic events.  Ryan Reynolds plays efficiency expert, kind of person who cannot live without organizers, priority lists and carefully scheduled events.  One morning, his wife plays a practical joke on him, that causes a series of events neither one of them could have possibly anticipated.  From mild misunderstanding to major discoveries, their entire married life suddenly start getting a whole new dimension to it.

1206985,3,B00000FA91,"***1/2

Spontaneity is not a highly esteemed commodity in Frank Allen's catalogue of virtues.  An efficiency trainer by avocation, Frank is a man whose own life is organized entirely around to-do lists, time charts and abstrusely calculated probabilities.  Then, one day Frank becomes a victim of circumstances so utterly beyond his control that he is forced to abandon his old way of thinking and adopt a new philosophy of life altogether, that of throwing caution to the wind and letting his every mercurial whim determine the course of his actions (he shuffles index cards to determine what it is he should do next).

""Chaos Theory,"" a small but insightful movie written by Daniel Taplitz and directed by Marcos Siega, boasts a cleverly addled storyline, some sharp, witty dialogue and energetic performances by Reynolds, Emily Mortimer and Stuart Townsend, the latter two as Frank`s wife and best friend, respectively.  The plot complications get pretty hot and heavy at times but, as with all good comedy, things have a way of straightening themselves out in the end.

Though there may be a few too many musical montage sequences in the movie for my taste - they always seem to be used as shortcuts to get the heart soaring or the tear ducts flowing - the movie has a fluidity and charm that raise it above any possible shortcomings.  Moreover, the Pacific Northwest setting provides a scenic backdrop for all the amusing shenanigans taking place on center stage.",1229817600,2,1468,4.96734693877551

The whole thing hinges on events that NO ONE would do - leaving your name, address and phone number at the hospital when dropping of a stranger for example.  Then there's the fight with his wife which could have been resolved in 30 seconds if he would have made any attempt at all to explain instead he ends up living in a dive motel.  Yeah, that would happen.  All the ""humor"" in this is telegraphed way ahead of time and the insipid sound track makes you fast forward through the ""touching reflective moments"".  I had my finger on the ""stop"" button at 30 minutes into this.  I went the distance but wish I hadn't.  This sucked.",1225065600,4,815,4.357615894039735

1207082,4,B00000FA91,"Synopsis: Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds) thinks he's figured out the perfect system for a happy, organized life. The secret is making lists, the more specific the better. His list making abilities have been so successful he makes a living teaching business seminars the profitability of list making.

Yes things are almost too perfect for the handsome, intelligent and successful husband and Father. That is until Frank's life takes a chaotic turn for the worse and he is faced with events that cannot be solved by writing them down on a piece of paper. There's only one solution, a new paradigm must be adapted if he is to survive what lies ahead; the Chaos Theory.

Critique: You're always off to a good start in any film when you have the likes of Ryan Reynolds in the starring role. Another big plus for the '07 dark comedy romance `Chaos Theory' is the presence of the talented Emily Mortimer as Reynolds wife Susan.

If you're like me you just might be surprised early on in this film that it isn't quite what you expected. If that's the case fight the urge to tune out and stay focused, there's really a lot going on in this film if you give it a chance. The dialogue is sharp and insightful, the message contemporary and Reynolds and Mortimer's performances excellent. Well worth a watch or two.",1218412800,15,1300,4.643478260869565

1207084,4,B00000FA91,"i hardly ever get to write movie reviews anymore. However this title i had jsut rented it on iTunes and was immensely connected to it. It was not your usual 21st century American suburbia crisis manifested in some town and then the family live on happily ever after!  well maybe they do! but besides the point the character of Ryan Reynolds was very captivating for me.  It was like ""you know things like this do and can happen, and we need to deal with it!""

the ending part i didn't really care for that much but it was sort of alright i suppose.  But the big message here was: the routine of life in at self will and should have some sort of catharsis...and you my human friend better sort it out in the most sincere way possible cause others are depending on you!

Stange and different sort of modern romance i suppose",1216252800,,822,4.34640522875817

And a wrap around wedding scenario, that bookends the main story, does not help, seemingly put there in a lumbering attempt to make some sort of thematic sense of the ""chaos"" of the central tale.  And to perhaps pad out the screen time. Take off this wedding framing device and the end credits and you have a pointless 75 minute tale about unlikeable people doing unlikeable things to no real end.

Frank's wisdom plays out over the course of the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chaos-Theory/dp/B00000FA91/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chaos Theory</a>&nbsp;as he shares a dramatic tale of the ups and downs of his own marriage experience.  As the story begins, Frank and his buddy, Buddy (Stuart Townsend) are fighting over the same girl, Susan Allen (Emily Mortimer).  Susan chooses to be with Frank and the two get married and have a daughter.  Jesse is seven at the beginning of the movie.

When Frank leaves for a lecture, his highly structured existence is screwed up when Susan intends to set the clock ahead 10 minutes as a joke, but instead sets it behind.  Frank ends up late for a lecture about time management.  Following the lecture, Frank is approached by the beautiful Paula Crowe (Sarah Chalke), who was at the lecture.  After several drinks and seductive compliments, Paula works her way into Frank's room.  Susan calls to check in and Frank immediately runs out to return home.

On his way home, Frank (driving drunk) runs a pregnant woman off the road.  Although attempting to do a good deed by helping her to the hospital, Frank actually sets off a chain reaction of events that lead to tale of love, forgiveness, and chaos.  This move is extremely thoughtful and charming.  Reynolds is one of our favorite actors and is brilliant as he portrays his character during multiple points in his life.  Emily Mortimer is also excellent in her role as the sought after leading lady, wife, and mother.  Her emotional acting is excellent.  This story is a good romantic comedy that should not scare guys away, as it offers some very `manly' comedic relief.
