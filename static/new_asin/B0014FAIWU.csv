3132280,5,B0014FAIWU,"I've spent hours upon hours trying to cobble a home-brewed DVD out of my tapes of these golden episodes. Just as I was about to go back to my annual summer project, I checked online and BOOM! Here they are, for sale! This show stretched the boundaries of television and humor in strange and amazing new directions. As close to a perfect disaster as has ever been broadcast.

PS: I have nine watches. None of them are fake.",1213920000,3,422,4.410256410256411
3132281,5,B0014FAIWU,"Jingle bells, jingle bells....

I am soooooooooo happy this is coming out on DVD. From Robert Goulet watching a puppet turtle vomit all over a Las Vegas casino table to AniPal puppets sneaking off to a Tijuana cockfight....let's not forget Triumph the Insult Comic Dog getting a hummer from a French poodle....this is some funny....um, stuff.

Robert Smigel is a comic genius!",1212624000,,376,5.048387096774194
3132282,5,B0014FAIWU,"I hoped that this would eventually come out on DVD.  I accidently left my only copy of this show in a VCR I sold in a garage sale to a soccer mom before I moved out of Layton, UT. (Sorry lady, hope your kids didn't see too much) Sames restaurant, Stedman, Atlantic city, a baby chick caught jerking it. All classy and all classics. Hooray!",1211241600,,339,4.2153846153846155
3132283,5,B0014FAIWU,YESSS!! Ive been waiting years for this to come out! like everyone else ive got a vhs tape that i taped off of one of those midnight marathons of TV Funhouse they used to run but its getting very worn out. ive nearly stopped watching it so that it would last a little longer but i can rest assured now. Horray for Mexicans Day!,1211241600,3,327,4.125
3132284,5,B0014FAIWU,"This show is so hilarious, it is like Monty Python on steroids.  I have 5 episodes that I recorded when it was on; I can't wait to see the rest of them.  I agree with everyone else who is amazed that this show was cancelled so soon.  I think it was so bizarre that the television programmers couldn't believe it was actually a great show!  I mean come on - it gave birth to Triumph the Comic Insult Dog!  If you like comedy, you must own this DVD!!!",1210723200,,449,4.056818181818182
3132285,5,B0014FAIWU,"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!!! No longer will I have to keep watching the 2 bad quality VHS recordings I have of 2 TV Funouse episodes.  I have no idea why it took them so long to release this.  Next to South Park and Chapelle Show, probably one of the best shows Comedy Central ever produced.  Too bad they didn't see the true genius of it and kept it going another season or two.",1207180800,,391,4.118421052631579
3132286,5,B0014FAIWU,"My review is based on the actual show - being that the DVD isn't out yet.  But I'll be happy even if the DVD is just the shows, because it was THAT good.  If you have a sharp sense of humor, and don't take things too serious, this is the show for you.",1207008000,2,251,3.7169811320754715
3132287,5,B0014FAIWU,"Funny subversive mock children's programming at its finest!!!!

Need I say more?",1206403200,,80,5.666666666666667
3132288,4,B0014FAIWU,"Finally out and hope it's a nice set. Very funny odd show that got cancelled too soon. Funny and sharp twisted spoof on children's TV shows that is not intended for children. Favorites include the Christmas episode and the cult episode. If you liked all the TV Funhouse animated shorts on SNL fair bet you will like this one. It never really found a slot on the comedy channel, but I would imagine this would be perfect for adult swim.",1204588800,2,435,4.45

3132340,5,B0014FAIWU,"I remember spending a lot of the summer of 8th grade with this show. Revisiting it now, and seeing how great pre-9/11 comedy was.",1401235200,,129,4.416666666666667
3132341,5,B0014FAIWU,"Show was way ahead of its time! I hear its missing a couple sketches but what ever, still LMAO! Must buy",1395273600,,104,4.0
3132342,5,B0014FAIWU,"This is the funniest show. I laugh now just thinking about it. ""I'm taking the pipes""! I can't understand why Comedy Central would have canned this, gem. It was and is insanely hilarious",1394064000,,186,4.666666666666667
3132343,5,B0014FAIWU,How was this show not given a 2nd season?! Great humor and super subversive! Bring back Doug and the Anipals!!,1391731200,,110,4.55
3132344,5,B0014FAIWU,"I actually had to stop watching after the first episode because it was too funny to take anymore. Wonderful! This show is in the same realm as The Uncle Floyd Show, but with a bit of remarkably sophisticated effort put into it. As an adult, I still enjoy kids shows and cartoons, so the spoofs done here are delicious if you recognize the source material. The truly demented social commentary is on the surface rightfully goofy, but abrasive enough to be thought provoking. I really believe these episodes should be shown in schools and discussed. Do turtles have a turtle Jesus? Why are bowel movements done in private rooms? What is the role of police in society?",1387670400,,665,4.6923076923076925
3132345,4,B0014FAIWU,"I reallyreallyreally wanted to give this 5 stars, but it's a flawed masterpiece. Robert Smigel starts out strong, then the series seems to lose steam near the end.  When the Ana-A-Pals visit Atlantic City, it's like the writer(s) went on autopilot.  YOU may want to hit the snooze button.

The first show starts off really strong, and they should have just put that on the disc and pretend they ""lost"" the last two episodes.  Kudos to Comedy Central for being brave enough to put this on in the first place, and kudos again for cutting it off as it became creatively bankrupt.  Yes, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is on those two last episodes, but don't think for a second that he saves it.",1384387200,,689,4.524193548387097
3132346,5,B0014FAIWU,this is one you will have to see if you like real weird things this is it and I loved its content,1381622400,,97,3.4545454545454546
3132347,5,B0014FAIWU,I loved this as a kid and I still love at as an adult. A great DVD to be had.,1376524800,,77,2.9
3132348,5,B0014FAIWU,"Not many of my friends enjoy this show. Kinda hard to follow the anipals and the stories never seem to have a finish, but I remember waiting when I was in middle school for this show to play. It was stupid and funny, and I loved it for it. It was right up there with Siffle and Ollie. I so miss the 90's. (Yes I know this show was 2000, but the 90's feel was still in the air for me).",1375833600,,384,3.753086419753086
3132379,1,B0014FAIWU,"I bought this because I thought there would be more clips of Triumph the Insult dog, but there wasn't .  It was really lame.",1370736000,,124,4.166666666666667
3132380,5,B0014FAIWU,"The show is nostalgic and pretty good.  For the average price of the movie, it is a worthy purchase to make.",1364515200,,108,4.142857142857143
3132381,5,B0014FAIWU,"These were great. I wish there had been more episodes made.
I highly reccomend these for adults only though.
Way to much information for kid under 15.",1364342400,,150,4.592592592592593
3132382,4,B0014FAIWU,a hilarious before its time TV show that i am so glad they came out with on DVD. this show was the funniest thing on TV a few years back too bad it didn't last more seasons on TV.,1351987200,,179,3.6153846153846154
3132383,5,B0014FAIWU,This is hilarious. I watched this when it was airing on Comedy Central. I couldn't believe there was something I liked. I wish there were more episodes.,1343174400,,152,4.666666666666667
3132384,5,B0014FAIWU,"I enjoyed TV funhoiuse when it was on Comedy central, now here it is again. this type of humor is not for everybody, you have understand the ""back stories"" to get most of it, however those of us that grew up in the fifties and sixties will find TV fun house to be a hoot",1297814400,,270,3.9272727272727272
3132385,5,B0014FAIWU,"Apparently some people are unaware that there used to be a spinoff show for the TV Funhouse franchise which is why some have been disappointed that certain material has been left off.  This DVD release has all the episodes and material that was shown on the original series show on Comedy Central, but anything that was on Saturday Night Live is not on the DVD because it was never on the circa-2001 cable show.  The picture quality and sound are top notch and look better than when they appeared on TV at the beginning of the last decade.",1297036800,11,539,4.489795918367347
3132386,5,B0014FAIWU,"I first saw TV Funhouse when it aired on comedy central.  I'm a big comedy fan and I have to admit I have a pretty open minded outlook.  This is truly one of the funniest shows ever aired in the history of television.  If you like Triumph the Insult Comic type humor then you will love this.  I personally feel that if you have never sampled this hilarious series then you have never really experienced the comedy genre.  Many of you will find parts of it offensive, some parts will just not make you laugh, but I can guarantee you will find something in this show that makes you laugh uncontrollably.  And don't expect your typical vanilla snl bs either.",1294790400,4,655,4.416666666666667
3132387,4,B0014FAIWU,"re: ""Run Time: 30 minutes""

Interesting. Didn't know you needed 2 DVDs for a scant 30 minutes. I'm impressed.",1280534400,,109,4.7368421052631575
3132388,4,B0014FAIWU,This show is hilarious but I generally have to watch it by myself because the humor is a miss for most watchers.  If you like Upright Citizen's Brigade or Whitest Kids U Know this will probably be right up your alley.,1259712000,,217,4.2926829268292686
3132409,5,B0014FAIWU,"I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but once again I'm grateful to Amazon for making it so easy to get stuff that would otherwise be impossible to find in stores. I think.",1251504000,,174,4.303030303030303
3132410,5,B0014FAIWU,I was so glad they finally released this on DVD.  It was even better than I remembered!  A must have for those of us with sick senses of humor.,1225670400,,143,3.896551724137931
3132411,5,B0014FAIWU,"Ever hear of Wonder Showzen?  It was on MTV2 for two seasons and went way overboard on more than a couple of occasions. If you already know what I'm talking about and haven't seen TV Funhouse, you need this one now.  Total comic nirvana - as in ""analogous to the band that influenced scores of bands after it"".  This one went over the edge long (three years or so) before Wonder Showzen was warping minds.

Far more subversively offensive as well when you consider some of the skits/cartoons they had (JoKamel; The Baby, The Immigrant and The Guy On Mushrooms; Mnemonics; etc.).",1222905600,,578,4.637254901960785
3132412,4,B0014FAIWU,"This show was basically a full-blown spin-off of the ""Triumph The Comic Dog"" character from Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as the ""TV Funhouse"" cartoons from SNL, and it shows, as Robert Smigel, the man behind the dog, has a whole show all to himself, and it's full of all the TV funhouse and vulgar puppet goodness you'd expect from a guy who did the same things on Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien.

Very graphic and obscene, but incredibly funny in a LOT of ways.",1219968000,,479,4.443181818181818
3132413,3,B0014FAIWU,"Just watched the first disc and was VERY disappointed that ""The Harlem Globetrotters First Christmas"" cartoon was left off the Christmas show. The TV Funhouse Christmas show is my favorite Christmas show of all time, but  the DVD set is missing this excellent blasphemous cartoon. I thought I would finally be able to lose the DVD I burned of the Christmas show off cable, but now it looks like I'd better keep it commercials and all. It's a pity they would do this and expect people not to notice. For this reason alone I subtract two stars.",1217635200,20,542,4.587628865979381
3132414,4,B0014FAIWU,"I agree with most of the other positive reviews, but one thing is lacking: This DVD set contains no material that was aired on Saturday Night Live even though it aired on TV Funhouse on Comedy Central.  This means the hilarious ""Ambiguously Gay Duo"" shorts and any other content from SNL are cut from this DVD set.

That's about the only downside to this DVD release of a hilariously funny short-lived show.",1216684800,6,407,4.638888888888889
3132415,5,B0014FAIWU,"- test subject monkey: ""i have eight watches, none of them are fake!""

3132416,5,B0014FAIWU,"Haven't seen the DVD but the show was incredibly funny -- the Stedman bit, the old guy in the cave with the mayo jar, the Wonderman-in-the-laundromat cartoon, the pokemon skit -- with a floating cigarette and the ""Assegore"" -- and a few others.  In retrospect, I think the live action part of the show, including the Anipals (approx 50% of the show?) were good, but the cartoons were exceptional.  These cartoons are deceptively simple and visciously funny.  Not everyone is going to enjoy the show.  Don't buy it as a gift for someone unless you know that person's sense of humor.  On the other hand, you can use this show to find out about a person's sense of humor.",1215475200,,668,4.579831932773109
3132417,5,B0014FAIWU,"Finally on DVD!!  Way ahead of it's time: smart, subversive, and imaginative.  Hopefully this DVD sells billions of copies and Comedy Central will have to get on their collective hands and knees and beg Robert Smigel to write 5 more seasons.  Bring this show back!!!",1214438400,3,266,4.866666666666666
3132418,4,B0014FAIWU,"This is def some off the wall comedy.  Akin to Wonder Showzen, this is some adult humor presented as a kids' show.  Parts are dated and not that funny, other parts are crazy and still funny.  Of course, this is just my opinion.

Worth checking out if you like weirder stuff like Wonder Showzen!",1213920000,,294,4.388888888888889

3366885,4,B0014FAIWU,This show is hilarious but I generally have to watch it by myself because the humor is a miss for most watchers.  If you like Upright Citizen's Brigade or Whitest Kids U Know this will probably be right up your alley.,1259712000,,217,4.2926829268292686

3366908,5,B0014FAIWU,"Ever hear of Wonder Showzen?  It was on MTV2 for two seasons and went way overboard on more than a couple of occasions. If you already know what I'm talking about and haven't seen TV Funhouse, you need this one now.  Total comic nirvana - as in ""analogous to the band that influenced scores of bands after it"".  This one went over the edge long (three years or so) before Wonder Showzen was warping minds.

Far more subversively offensive as well when you consider some of the skits/cartoons they had (JoKamel; The Baby, The Immigrant and The Guy On Mushrooms; Mnemonics; etc.).",1222905600,,578,4.637254901960785
3366909,4,B0014FAIWU,"This show was basically a full-blown spin-off of the ""Triumph The Comic Dog"" character from Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as the ""TV Funhouse"" cartoons from SNL, and it shows, as Robert Smigel, the man behind the dog, has a whole show all to himself, and it's full of all the TV funhouse and vulgar puppet goodness you'd expect from a guy who did the same things on Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien.

Very graphic and obscene, but incredibly funny in a LOT of ways.",1219968000,,479,4.443181818181818
3366910,3,B0014FAIWU,"Just watched the first disc and was VERY disappointed that ""The Harlem Globetrotters First Christmas"" cartoon was left off the Christmas show. The TV Funhouse Christmas show is my favorite Christmas show of all time, but  the DVD set is missing this excellent blasphemous cartoon. I thought I would finally be able to lose the DVD I burned of the Christmas show off cable, but now it looks like I'd better keep it commercials and all. It's a pity they would do this and expect people not to notice. For this reason alone I subtract two stars.",1217635200,20,542,4.587628865979381
3366911,4,B0014FAIWU,"I agree with most of the other positive reviews, but one thing is lacking: This DVD set contains no material that was aired on Saturday Night Live even though it aired on TV Funhouse on Comedy Central.  This means the hilarious ""Ambiguously Gay Duo"" shorts and any other content from SNL are cut from this DVD set.

That's about the only downside to this DVD release of a hilariously funny short-lived show.",1216684800,6,407,4.638888888888889

3366913,5,B0014FAIWU,"Haven't seen the DVD but the show was incredibly funny -- the Stedman bit, the old guy in the cave with the mayo jar, the Wonderman-in-the-laundromat cartoon, the pokemon skit -- with a floating cigarette and the ""Assegore"" -- and a few others.  In retrospect, I think the live action part of the show, including the Anipals (approx 50% of the show?) were good, but the cartoons were exceptional.  These cartoons are deceptively simple and visciously funny.  Not everyone is going to enjoy the show.  Don't buy it as a gift for someone unless you know that person's sense of humor.  On the other hand, you can use this show to find out about a person's sense of humor.",1215475200,,668,4.579831932773109

3366915,4,B0014FAIWU,"This is def some off the wall comedy.  Akin to Wonder Showzen, this is some adult humor presented as a kids' show.  Parts are dated and not that funny, other parts are crazy and still funny.  Of course, this is just my opinion.

Worth checking out if you like weirder stuff like Wonder Showzen!",1213920000,,294,4.388888888888889

Then there are moments that are pretty funny, some that are not funny but entertaining, some that are not entertaining but not boring, and then a few bits that are, let's face it, BOHHH...RING!!!  I came away from watching this set feeling no regret for the purchase but no real desire to watch it a second time (at least not anytime soon) and not confident to recommend it to others.",1499644800,,475,4.698795180722891
8255571,1,B0014FAIWU,"I bought this video with high expectations based largely on the participation of the genius known as Robert Smigel.  Alas, it is unwatchable.  The basic premise is they take a bunch of memes from the 1950s (when the squares who ruled culture force fed us all sorts of unintentionally hilarious, naive dreck) and fill it with raunchiness and profanity.  Such an amazing idea -- no one has ever made fun of clueless, dated source material in this way before!

There's a host who bores us to tears by relentlessly playing the chipper, happy go lucky square regardless of whatever nasty stuff his anipals say or do.  The analpals go on various adventures which invariably culminate in them sodomizing live animals (or, in even zanier moments, each other).  Then there's the dog who's always chasing his tail -- with hilarious results.  Really, the fun never stops... because it never starts.",1497052800,,887,4.912751677852349

8255573,5,B0014FAIWU,"It brings me back to when I was 20! (I was about 20 when I would watch this show). Anyways, this has to be one of the strangest and crudest shows that I've ever seen on Comedy Central, and that's why I love it. What other show features live animals (who always look bored to tears, if animals could cry, btw) (hilarious) like dogs, cats, bunnies, an occasional chimp or horse et cetera along animal puppets getting into crass adult situations? What other show features a man-boy who is always abandoned by these uninterested animals when he wants to do some childish and quirky activity? What other show features Robert Goulet and his impromptu marriage to a stripper/""chimpstitute"" chimpanzee in a feather boa and ginger wig? I told you it was amazing. It shows Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and has his type of humor, if you're familiar with that. Don't let the innocent cover picture fool you, this show is NOT for kids. In fact I think it would have an MA-17 rating. There is a lot of sexual stuff in it which is not appropriate for kids but is weirdly hilarious when juxtaposed with the animal puppets and the unharmed but very bored real animals. It is quirky and crass to the max so if this is the kind of humor that makes you laugh or just watch with befuddled amazement this show is for you.",1434499200,,1299,4.46218487394958
