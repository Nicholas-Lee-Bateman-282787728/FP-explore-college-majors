It's a real funny movie. I actually bought it for my girlfriend. She watches it all the time. I just saw it on TV once, thought it was great, and got it for her because I knew she would like it. If you want to watch a  funny movie that you and your girlfriend can both watch together, but each get something different from it, get this movie. You won't be disappointed.",1455321600,,526,4.207920792079208
8551204,2,B00AG4774C,The story was sometimes funny and sometimes sad(so much lying) but it was mainly just unbelievable and quite contrived. The male character was dislikeable.,1452297600,,155,5.5
