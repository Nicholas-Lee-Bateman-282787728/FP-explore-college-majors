5562486,1,B00B81NPGQ,"This was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.  I suppose I continued to watch it hoping there would be some type of lesson out of all the tragedy.

5562487,1,B00B81NPGQ,"I must have missed something in this movie... I managed to make it all the way through but I saw nothing in the characters. Just odd, bad... n bizarre.

5562491,5,B00B81NPGQ,"When is ones Muse amusing?  Phew, this movie is like a four course meal at the Four Seasons in Seattle. You walk away pleasantly surprised saying to yourself so that is fine dinning.

 This is fine writing. (at least the translator would want you to think so) Don't blink you won't want to miss a word otherwise you will be pressing the rewind a lot.

 You have to have patience. Its a little slow at the start.  Oh, hell it's pretty slow all the way through. Its worth it if you like to watch a movie and not a road map spelling things out as you trudge along.",1364774400,6,561,4.148148148148148
5562492,3,B00B81NPGQ,"How can you talk about a movie without giving any spoils out...Well, this movie a bit hard to follow. When you know what's going on, you see that you had no idea. It is very slow going movie. very little, extreme brief nudity in the movie. Movie actually about is an affair. And in this affair, husband dies in the car accident with his girl friend-mistress.

5562496,5,B00B81NPGQ,"This movie is now my favorite of all time. As far as I am concerned, the story tellers got it right. It must of been extremely difficult to write this movie because there is simply no cliche in this work as far as I know and well thought out. Do yourself a favor, just view this for yourself. There isn't movie made that can do all things for everyone. This film should be seen as the artwork that it is.",1425081600,,404,4.0625

5562505,1,B00B81NPGQ,"I was misled into buying this movie through the notion that it would be a worthwhile watch given the fact that it won The Pusan Award. However, it ended up being a dull and slow moving movie revolving around two childhood friends, one of whom is having an S&M affair with her friend's husband and offers herself to her friend, who, initially, spurns her advances but, eventually, ends up having an affair and engaging in sex with her.

One of the worst lesbian dramas around.

Stay away at all costs.",1411171200,,500,4.544444444444444

5562511,4,B00B81NPGQ,"While subtle plot points are occasionally lost on me (as, not being Korean, I sometimes miss important cultural and dialogue cues), I still have found myself enjoying much of the Korean films I see. This one is another example of the complexities and creativity that I find so compelling.

Jung-Ha's husband Jane is having a (consensually) often-violent affair with Naru. Jane is killed in an automobile collision caused when he and Naru are having sex in a car by the road. Naru is eventually summoned (supernaturally) to Jung-Ha's home, as a sort of penance, for the affair and Jane's death. Jane, as a ghost or apparition, also remains until Jung-Ha allows him to leave.

The whole story is narrated as fiction, as an ""outer story"", in which a man tells the story to a woman, the two apparently meant to be Jane and Jung-Ha respectively. By the end of the movie, it's not really clear to whom the story has really happened.

Some may be frustrated by the ambiguity. Others may be looking for a movie with more prurient interest. Such viewers should pass on this movie, as there's much of the former and little of the latter. But for those who have enjoyed the creativity and fantasy, even sometimes troubling or disturbing, that is often found in Korean films, this film is worth a watch.",1405987200,9,1291,4.70353982300885

5562514,3,B00B81NPGQ,"It's a movie about a woman who is dealing with the loss of her husband while his mistress is searching for forgiveness and closure; it's a bit dark and has a sensual texture that permeates the entire movie, with a decent touch. If you're looking for character development, there is very little; the movie is more about the journey of a grieving soul. I got a bit lost near the end, and that's partly the reason for the 3-star rating.",1402358400,,433,4.425
5562515,4,B00B81NPGQ,"If you are expecting everything to be spelled out, this movie is not for you.  It is about forgiving, guilt and grief.  I found it intriguing and well done.  Parts of it was hard to watch but I think that was the point.",1400457600,,219,4.046511627906977
5562516,5,B00B81NPGQ,"At first glance, both at the cover of the movie and the general summary, you'd think this movie would be a provocative thriller, when in actuality, it's more of a psychological drama.

Here, you have the classic tale of the vengeful, wounded widow and her husband's wanton lover. Everything you might expect to come of this scenario, you get plus so much more. From spiteful behavior on the widow's end to the submissive nature of the paramour, no expense was spared in the feelings department. Not only does this film play on the themes of forgiveness and bitterness, but also that of real companionship and subconscious longing.

While the entire pace of the film is very slow, the acting, music and overall cinematography is impeccable. Despite the confusing composition of dead and alive characters, there is just enough mystery and realism to keep you watching. The writing character development is very much multidimensional and the acting is so realistic that you feel as they feel. Do not watch this with the intent of seeing much, but rather to think and relate. I would watch this movie again and again!",1400025600,,1113,4.883597883597884

5562518,2,B00B81NPGQ,Nothing really happens in this entire movie.  I don't understand what the writer and director were going for in this movie.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.,1397001600,,167,4.928571428571429

5562520,1,B00B81NPGQ,"Don't let the cover fool you, this movie was rather intense. It had no plot and no real acts of lesbianism except for one terrifying scene.

5562521,4,B00B81NPGQ,"Interesting take on the Korean Psyche which is quite different than say the Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, etc.
The cinematography is simplistically elegant, the acting quite good. The depth of the characters is more than adequate. The editing interesting moving between past and present, between live and dead characters. Quite good!",1395100800,,340,5.686274509803922
5562522,2,B00B81NPGQ,The film had an opportunity to take the characters in directions that would have made the film more intriging. Instead it ended with no real revolations revealed by the mistress serving the widow. In the end I imagine it provided catharsis for the widow.,1392508800,,254,4.795454545454546
5562523,2,B00B81NPGQ,"This movie was Just not as interesting as I hoped it would be. Kind of weird to me, just not my kind of movie.",1391990400,,110,3.625
5562524,2,B00B81NPGQ,"If you liked Ghost and don't mind a little sex in a tedious would-be art film, ignore this review.

I watched this for the promising title, in hope of that revelation, and there's enough here to say that it's apt.  But it's dull, should have been a short - it's at least twice as long as the ideas warrant, and some weird extra ""stuff"" with plants, and a little rough sex thrown in (extreme to my view, but well done, barely any nudity [but don't watch with your kids]) so that maybe we'll believe this connection is important to someone.

Really, I love many Asian movies, but I had to force myself thru this, and then wonder why.  The actress playing Naru is good in a hopeless part, the others irritatingly not.  The screenplay is all but awful, except that it's elaborated (drawn out?) from 3 ideas/sentences that are quite worthy.  Sorry, I won't add the spoiler, but don't waste your time looking.
I can't say I hated it, but should one be irritated for 90 minutes in a pointless hope for art, or at least interest?  Artists may say so.",1390176000,7,1042,4.424083769633508
5562525,5,B00B81NPGQ,"At first this movie seems to be about a man telling a story he's writing to a woman who is plying him with drinks. He seems an unwilling drinker as she nags hims to drink and resorts to stripping one garment for each glass of wine he drinks.

The story he's telling is about an extreme sexual relationship between a man and woman that includes a lot of S&M as well as high risk encounters (think sex in a moving car).

At some point you realize the author is telling his own story of infidelity to his wife. That he is in fact dead from the sex in the car incident. That his mistress is not dead but is severely hurt.

It is difficult to tell what is past versus present. For example, you see the damaged mistress at the site of the crash but then she moves in with the dead husband and the wife and she, the mistress, is undamaged.

The wife torments the mistress because she is so angry with her. For her part, the mistress is apologetic and tries to make up to the widowed wife by being extremely subservient and by helpful.

You realize that the wife is grieving and the dead husband and mistress are hallucinations that she is interacting with to help her come to a resolution.

Near the end of the movie, she has a revealing epiphany that helps her move on and forgive.

The sex is pretty extreme and violent at times, which makes the wife's epiphany all the more interesting.",1390176000,,1382,4.292307692307692
5562526,5,B00B81NPGQ,"I love Japanese cinema.
Usually the horror movies capture my attention!!
And although this one was very erotic, it was also a little creepy and suspenseful.
But what I enjoyed most, was that it told a GREAT story!!!",1389744000,,215,4.684210526315789
5562527,2,B00B81NPGQ,"Weird storytelling of a book to his wife of his lover killing him and the lover becomes the wife's slave, while his ghost watches them then lover to the wife.  Too much build up to the lesbian part of the story.  Plus in between going back of the husband and wife getting drunk telling the story got annoying.",1389657600,,309,4.310344827586207
5562528,3,B00B81NPGQ,"To be honest with you, I clicked on this thinking it would end up as a Yuri (I mean, look at the cover art!). Boy, was I mistaken. Just when I thought I had this movie figured out, they'd throw a twist in there, and I'd be confused all over again. At the same time, though, I stuck around wanting to see how it ended. Honestly, it wasn't the worse movie out there, but I definitely don't think I'll be watching it again any time soon (or at all).",1388102400,2,446,4.022471910112359
5562529,2,B00B81NPGQ,"Translation to english was terrible.  Reading the caption and following along with the story leads you to believe there is no plot, but there actually is",1387756800,,153,4.884615384615385

5562531,4,B00B81NPGQ,"There's nothing mysterious or ambiguous about this film, as other reviewers seemed to believe.

It's an elegant and beautiful piece of work.",1387584000,3,303,4.96078431372549

5562533,5,B00B81NPGQ,I didn't really understand this paricular movie it was kind of confusing to me. I don't know what else to say.,1387497600,,110,4.285714285714286
8563870,4,B00B81NPGQ,"""In My End is My Beginning"" was originally filmed as a short film segment for the omnibus film, ""Five Senses of Eros.""  The expanded theatrical version includes ""the end"" of the relationship which was not shown in the short film segment.

Even after watching this I am confused at what I saw.  This story is started by a man talking to a woman. But is the man really there? Is the woman reading her dead husband's novel and projecting. Is this a supernatural tale full of magic and actual spirits or something else? It is confusing and I am not sure of just what it is.  And I am not sure I care as I became engrossed in the film and wanted to find out where it went. My feeling is that this is one of those cultural things where you have to be part of the language and culture to truly understand it.

This was far better than the typical Korean erotic ghost story (if you can call any of them typical). Jane is having a sado-macsocist relationship with his lover, Na-Roo. Na-Roo is his muse and this strange, violent and very disturbing relationship gives him inspiration to write that has eluded him in his stale marriage. He is killed in an automobile accident with his mistress two weeks before he is to leave for Spain with his his wife, Jung-ha.

Na-Roo comes to see Jung-ha and wants to give herself as slave/servant to Jung-ha. Partially to serve penance and partially to be close to the spirit of Jane. Is Na-Roo a magician who does slight of hand tricks or is she an ethereal spirit herself? She appears in Jung-ha's home in a most unusual way.

This is a very sexy film without any nudity. The women really act well and in the less disturbing scenes it is erotic. ""In My End is My Beginning"" is one of those movies I enjoyed just for the  fact that it is well done in story and acting.",1443571200,2,1797,4.3273809523809526
