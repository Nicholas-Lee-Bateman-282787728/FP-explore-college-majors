8498874,5,B006IU0R4K,"Awesome! Love these old Jack LaLanne shows. Each DVD has 5 weekly episodes (Monday through Friday). Each episode is about 20 minutes. Some of the exercises are tougher than you might expect, especially as you move up through the series of 10 DVDs. Almost every episode includes Jack's dog ""Happy"", although, his other dog ""Smiley"" and his tiny dog ""Trim"" are also sometimes featured. Highly recommend!",1422057600,4,401,5.090909090909091
