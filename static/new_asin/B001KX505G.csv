While Imdb claims the original runtime is 100 minutes, that would mean all existing DVD releases are cut by almost 10 minutes.  I doubt the accuracy of their number.

What is a fact is that the UK DVD is at least 2-3 minutes longer (adjusting for PAL speedup).
In just the first 2 minutes of this DVD, one scene has been shortened cutting some action and dialog and another scene has been removed completely.

There are 3 minutes of Deleted Scenes as a bonus feature, but not the scenes that were removed.

Import the UK release if you can.  Publishers like BFS should be ignored.

Odd-choice-plus 1/2-star for the 65 minute 'Making of' featurette.
Minus a 1/2 star for hard telecining everything.",1377820800,,770,4.617647058823529
8316449,5,B001KX505G,"I think this movie is so funny and i love me some Dexter Fletcher. I was first introduced to Dexter Fletcher when I watch Hotel Babylon,and I was wondering what other shows or movies he has been in, and that is when I came across this movie. I bought this DVD hoping that it would be funny and it is. When I was watching it i could not stop laughing. Really good.",1366416000,,363,4.055555555555555

In the end, it actually was not that disappointing, and Mr. Fletcher got a chance to carry a comedy.

The story follows Fletcher's dental surgeon character as he wades through a loveless life, often at the mercy of his wretched step mom, all while being helped by his beautiful assistant (Parminder). Linda Hamilton (not sure how to take this role - as she had a horrible accent and appeared to be completely lost) plays a clueless private eye that lusts after every hot woman in the film. The dentist discovers his dreams are coming true (literally and figuratively) and decides to try and change the apparent outcomes as they occur, all whilst Hamilton stumbles along to assist.

The scenes are almost skit oriented and usually corny, but have some funny visuals, and even an honest feel to them at times. Dexter feels like a leading comedy actor here, so maybe this will be his calling. I would have given this an average rating but the DVD makers hit my weak spot and put an hour-long Soultanakis-like documentary on it. This actually turned out to be better than the film; a thorough logistical depiction of making an independent production. Then they added the three deleted scenes that were rightfully trimmed from the movie. Putting two proper supplements on there gave it another star; I always love to see just the right amount and properly produced segments on a DVD instead of the large volumes of fluff they put out sometimes.

A fun watch as a rental, probably an owner for the Parminder fans as she appears to have nothing else going on right now.",1240185600,2,1742,4.686274509803922
