8659220,5,B00KI8IA4M,"This is a GREAT experience for any Blues Lover,  or fan of live music.  It captures the ""flavor"" and makes you want to go to South Los Angeles.  I have the book also,  and both are well worth the money.  The author/director loves the subject deeply  and you feel that respect,  for the medium.  The Blues.  It's an art and a lifestyle.  She's managed to preserve the legacy,  for generations to come.  Highly recommend.",1420761600,,419,4.513513513513513
