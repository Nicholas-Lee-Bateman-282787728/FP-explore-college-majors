7998288,5,B0000C8Y14,"It's my 3rd one I bought because I keep giving them and loaning them out to friends. It's just the right amount of time (3 sessions for 20 minutes) in the late afternoon for a body refresher. And just the right amount of time before bed to get relaxed. If you want a longer session, do two of them. I love the affirmations  they say to set your mind in a positive flow with each pose. You will enjoy this DVD!

7998289,2,B0000C8Y14,"I thought it would be more of a work out than just a calming centering routine and its just a matter of personal preference that I do not like the voices of the people leading it. I did all of the routines and will say that it could be really nice but wasn't my cup of tea.

If you are looking for something that is fast and simply calming, you aren't flexible or familiar with yoga I would say go for it. All the poses are easy and have modified versions for people who need them. I also don't like that they constantly have affirmations like ""I am stable like a tree"" x3 or some such thing, I have my own affirmations in yoga and found theirs distracting.",1386806400,2,657,4.1328125
7998290,4,B0000C8Y14,"I was interested in trying the Ananda style of yoga, and this DVD is one of the only offerings available.  It has three practices of approximately 25 minutes each, two of which are led by Rich McCord, Director of Ananda Yoga worldwide, and the third of which is instructed by Lisa Powers, an Ananda Yoga Teacher Trainer.  Although this DVD was released in 2003, in has more of a 1970s feel to it.  The production values are pretty basic:  each practice features the instructor in a sparse tiled room, providing voiceover instruction that sometimes is a bit lacking in sound quality.  According to the DVD case, the VITALITY routine will ""reinvigorate,"" the CALMNESS routine will ""restore a sense of inner peace and well-being, and the ""INNER HARMONY"" routine will transform ""edgy, angry, moody, or scattered"" states.

The Main Menu offers the following options:  Play--Scene Selection--Interview.  From Scene Selection, you can choose the three practices individually, although selecting the first will have the effect of playing all (i.e., you will NOT be returned to the Main Menu after the first session is completed).  In the short (3.5 minutes) introduction, McCord explains that the purpose of Ananda Yoga is to engage the entire being.  This style of yoga also couples the postures with specific mantras which are repeated several times to oneself (e.g., ""I am free"").  Furthermore, each practice ends with a brief guided meditation with the idea that the practitioner would then continue with his/her own seated meditation.  I have broken down the three practices in detail below.

VITALITY (McCord; 25 minutes)
This practice begins seated on a cushion, opening the breathing with diaphragmatic breaths.  McCord also performs side stretches and ""double"" breathing.  Coming to standing, he continues with further side stretching as well as triangle pose.  Moving back to the floor, McCord comes to seated on the heels (""firm pose"") before moving onto the stomach for locust.  Flipping over to the back, he moves through boat pose, showing the posture modified with one leg at a time but also displaying the full options with both legs.  Returning to seated on the cushion, McCord stretches into a small backbend, sort of a reverse plank with the legs crossed.  This practice concludes with approximately 4 minutes guided relaxation (McCord uses a surfing analogy) before finishing in a seated position.

CALM & CENTERED (Powers; 24.5 minutes)
Powers also begins her practice seated on a cushion for diaphragmatic breathing, then moves into tensing and releasing with the breath.  Next, she comes standing into a partial squat position (horse stance) for several stretching moves.  This is followed by additional standing postures, including tree pose, chair, and squat.  Coming back down to the floor on her knees, Powers performs rabbit pose, a kneeling backbend stretch, and reclining back on the elbows. She transitions with staff pose and then moves to her back for fish pose and a reclined twist.  During the 4-minute savasana, Powers encourages meditation on silence; she ends the practice with a brief spine massage and seated meditation.

HARMONIZING THE HEART (McCord, 25.5 minutes)
Again starting the practice seated, McCord encourages both diaphragmatic breathing and a connection to the heart center, adding sweeping arm movements to the experience of the breath.  Coming to standing, McCord performs several rounds of ""whole body breathing,"" or breathing in and tensing the body and then breathing out and releasing.  He continues with a standing forward bend and then moves to kneeling for camel pose.  In a seated position, McCord moves through one-legged seated forward bend, modified side plank, half fish pose, and cow seat.  Finally, bridge pose is held for a few minutes before the practice concludes with a shorter (2.5 minutes) savasana and seated meditation.

In general, I found these to be gentle, relaxing yoga routines.  Personally, I enjoy both mantra and meditation as part of yoga practice, but as presented by these instructors, it felt a bit stale and over-the-top to me.  (For comparison, I much prefer Eoin Finn's fresh, down-to-earth meditations in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blissology/dp/B004CTI5SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blissology</a>&nbsp;set; I also enjoy Kundalini Yoga DVDs with Ravi Singh and Ana Brett, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-the-Chakras/dp/B000I2JCBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance the Chakras</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kundalini-Yoga-Solar-Power/dp/B0035AO4VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kundalini Yoga Solar Power</a>.)

7998291,5,B0000C8Y14,"I absolutely love this video.  Ananda yoga is what yoga's supposed to be!  Light some incense, put in the DVD, and get ready to RELAX!  I've been to an Ananda yoga center here, and it's the next best thing to going to a class.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!",1315785600,,256,4.163265306122449
7998292,5,B0000C8Y14,"I attended a great ananda yoga class 4 years ago, that brought me not only inner peace, but helped me conceive my only child.  Since then, I have moved overseas, and and after trying so many yoga DVDs without finding inner peace, I finally found this amazing and simple Yoga for Busy People.  OK, the title left me in doubt, initially, but after just 3 sessions, I felt the way I was back 4 years ago, peaceful, more positive, healthier, and best of all, my blood pressure went back to normal.  I also breathe easier now.  I would recommend this for anybody looking to de-stress their lives.  It is the best out there!  And not to worry, the yoga poses here are so simple, even beginners will find them easy.",1198540800,9,708,4.407692307692308
7998293,5,B0000C8Y14,"This practice and the DVD entitled Yoga to awaken the Chakras are wonderful. Ananda Yoga uses affirmations during the yoga practice. It is very meditative and refreshing. You work on individual chakras thru yoga postures, breathing techniques, and positive thoughts. Yoga for Busy People is broken into 3-20 segments and you can do them individually or all together. Each segment ends with a visual-yoga nidra type of relaxation. Yoga to Awaken the Chakras goes thru each of the seven chakras again thru postures, breathing, techniques, and positive affermations.
If you have not tried Ananda Yoga yet, I would recommend starting with Yoga for Busy People. If you like it, try Yoga to Awaken the Chakras. I use both and alternate with my other Kundalini Yoga, Hatha Yoga, and Tai Chi personal practice.
