3070705,5,B0011Z5NN2,"A master at work, Deepak Chopra describes in a simple and doable way, the prescription to Happiness using the Buddhist philosophy. Part one of the DVD is an explanation of the 8 fold path and ways to experience happiness. Part 2 of the DVD is practical demonstration on how this works using some of his participants in the program. I found part one of the DVD of greater use for me although part 2 had some valuable suggestions. For many of us who look outside of us for happiness, these DVD's drive home the fact that happiness is an inner job, we must look within us and once we recognize this everything fits perfectly well in the schema of things. An enjoyable, worthwhile and educational program, a must for anybody who desires greater awareness in coping with daily life and its challenges. I would like this to be part of the curriculum at schools so that children can learn these concepts early and apply these both in their school and home.",1287446400,5,949,4.555555555555555
3070706,5,B0011Z5NN2,"This DVD really speaks to me of issues I am familiar with and how to overcome them.  I'm positive it speaks to everyone.  We watched it while doing a puzzle, and I found myself relaxing and slowly enjoying the process of putting the puzzle together instead of rushing and trying to figure out how to get it done as quickly as possible.  This DVD reminded me that I have forgotten how to be in the present, how to stop looking at the end goal and enjoy the journey.  As a person who has struggled with depression, fear of dying, and what Deepak refers to as ""existential suffering"" for many years, this DVD is definitely a huge step toward becoming free.  I want to watch it a few more times and get back to how ""present"" I once was.  Plus, Deepak is really funny and warm and shows his great fashion sense. ;)",1267660800,5,809,4.2894736842105265
3070707,2,B0011Z5NN2,"I am very familiar with Deepak Chopra's work, and I am a big fan of his.  I am right in line with his beliefs, and my new favorite book is Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul, and I very much recommend that book and/or audio cd.  I have both.  I have MANY of his books, and love them all.  But THIS.  This dvd is just wrong - I don't know what Deepak had in mind when he decided to wear Elton John-like red sparkly glasses.  It completely corrupts his message, in my opinion.  And I LOVE this guy!  My husband and I just couldn't help laughing most of the time while we were watching this because the glasses are just that distracting.  They sparkle!  Deepak Chopra is talking about meditation, chakras, changing your perspective, unity of all things, and these glasses are catching the light everywhere he turns.  This is a great thinker and he's wearing movie star glitter.  The one saving grace are the two meditations under ""Extras"" on the second dvd.  Those are quite enjoyable.  But honestly, I also didn't like the audience format and the small groups of people he sits with.  It's all distracting, and keeps me from wanting to watch again - again, the glasses and the extra people corrupt the message.  I would have preferred just having him speak to the camera.",1265846400,12,1278,4.5394736842105265
3070708,5,B0011Z5NN2,"Deepak Chopra believes that if you are happy you will naturally be healthier and more successful. He explains how we have the happiness formula backwards. Wealth does not bring happiness but being happy might bring wealth. This is probably just because you will have a more positive outlook on life.

In this DVD, Deepak Chopra explores meditation, cognitive therapy, pleasure, existential suffering, peace, harmony, good relationships, money, choices we make daily, helping humanity, dreams for the world, death, love and compassion. He explains how we should live in the present, get rid of toxic emotions and replace fear with love.

The audience is very responsive and there are quite a few times Deepak Chopra has everyone laughing. They do become really quiet when he starts discussing death.

While most of this DVD is about Buddhist teachings there is one mention of Jesus Christ. I found that this DVD could be enjoyed by anyone of any religion. The only thing I found myself questioning was Deepak's advice to a young boy to tell people he was ""universal"" when describing how he felt about religion. While you can take something good from most religions and personally apply it to your life I think it would be very difficult to say believe in a religion that worships idols and worship the one true God. It would seem that you would always be in conflict in such a case.

Deepak appears in this video wearing his trademark red sparkly glasses. He is very nicely dressed with a matching red shirt and red shoes. At first the glasses were a bit distracting but he is an excellent storyteller and soon I was enjoying his tales from India. I felt that watching this DVD confirmed some of my beliefs like that happiness comes from making other people happy and that you are happier when you have a sense of accomplishment.

3070713,5,B0011Z5NN2,"I have watched about 8 different DVD titles on happiness
and such. This is the best I have seen.  Not only did it
change my life, but the life of people around me - at work,
at home and at social gathering simply because I have
changed - more peaceful, happy, joyful, and self-centered.

I've ordered 6 copies of this title and have given them to
whoever wanted it. I watched this more than 10 times over
a period of a month, never got tired of it.  Because there
is so much Deepak is saying, it takes time (many times)
to get a deeper understanding of his teachings.

This is an update on 12/30/2009.  It has been more than 1 1/2 years since
I started watching the DVDs.  I found that I need to calm myself once
in a while to clear my disturbances and personal conflicts by watching the DVDs.
I have picked up daily meditation about a year ago.  It has
many benefits - allowing me to remain calm, peaceful, and become healthier.

There is another DVD that is my favorite too - 10 Secrets to
Success and Inner Peace by Wayne Dyer.  One of the keys for me was
you must try to send love in response to hate.  It works for me on
numerous occasions, at work and at home.  I used to react, but my personal
experience shows that it only 'works' in short term.

I've also come to understand the law of attraction - love attracts love,
and hate attracts hate.

I am still working on ""in this world, but not of it"".

Update 1/6/2011.  It has been more than a year since my last update.  I am getting
closer to the understanding of ""in this world, but not of it"". I am
still working on it, however.  I was educated as a scientist,
which helped give me some insights into this possibility and probability. I have
seen two individuals on 2 separate occasions from a distance years ago.
Each time it gave me a sense of serenity and peace.  Unfortunately, I missed the
opportunity to meet them face-to-face.

My inward journey is now onto human psychology and emotions, trying to define and
understand the dichotomy of emotions, and the reasons why I react the way I do.

Update 9/26/2011.  I finally understand ""In this world, but not of it"".
It fundamentally changes the way I look at myself and the world.  We're One!

As always Deepak is easy to understand and very inspiring. I reccomend this even if you don't think you need this.",1211241600,15,599,4.555555555555555
3305210,5,B0011Z5NN2,"I have watched about 8 different DVD titles on happiness
and such. This is the best I have seen.  Not only did it
change my life, but the life of people around me - at work,
at home and at social gathering simply because I have
changed - more peaceful, happy, joyful, and self-centered.

I've ordered 6 copies of this title and have given them to
whoever wanted it. I watched this more than 10 times over
a period of a month, never got tired of it.  Because there
is so much Deepak is saying, it takes time (many times)
to get a deeper understanding of his teachings.

This is an update on 12/30/2009.  It has been more than 1 1/2 years since
I started watching the DVDs.  I found that I need to calm myself once
in a while to clear my disturbances and personal conflicts by watching the DVDs.
I have picked up daily meditation about a year ago.  It has
many benefits - allowing me to remain calm, peaceful, and become healthier.

There is another DVD that is my favorite too - 10 Secrets to
Success and Inner Peace by Wayne Dyer.  One of the keys for me was
you must try to send love in response to hate.  It works for me on
numerous occasions, at work and at home.  I used to react, but my personal
experience shows that it only 'works' in short term.

I've also come to understand the law of attraction - love attracts love,
and hate attracts hate.

I am still working on ""in this world, but not of it"".

Update 1/6/2011.  It has been more than a year since my last update.  I am getting
closer to the understanding of ""in this world, but not of it"". I am
still working on it, however.  I was educated as a scientist,
which helped give me some insights into this possibility and probability. I have
seen two individuals on 2 separate occasions from a distance years ago.
Each time it gave me a sense of serenity and peace.  Unfortunately, I missed the
opportunity to meet them face-to-face.

My inward journey is now onto human psychology and emotions, trying to define and
understand the dichotomy of emotions, and the reasons why I react the way I do.

Update 9/26/2011.  I finally understand ""In this world, but not of it"".
It fundamentally changes the way I look at myself and the world.  We're One!
