4114523,3,B003ES5JDS,"Just watched this and the story and animation are excellent.  Even if you have read the story already, this does really bring it to life quite well.  So, you might be wondering why give it such praise for only a 3 Star rating.  The voice acting is why.  Neil Patrick Harris and Jensen Ackles both delivered excellent voice work here that I expected from NPH, but was pleasantly surprised by Mr. Ackles.  The Joker's voice was really bad, the laugh was pretty good, but the dialogue was awful.  This guy was just not right for Joker unless all he did was laugh.  Alfred was completely out of place, bad casting.  Batman's voice was ok.  There were times when it was wrong, and there were a handful of times when it was right.  It did not feel as though it had the weight of Batman for almost the whole film.  It was not awful, but it really makes you appreciate Kevin Conroy's excellence in delivering both Bruce Wayne's billionaire cover and Batman's tortured soul through his work.  In this great story, Batman sounded as though he never felt weighed down by what was in front of him.  I am sure these people are nice people and tried to do an excellent job, it just was not a good fit for them.

Summary:  Amazing story with great art work that unfortunately had a few voices that immediately make you disconnect and drop the illusion that otherwise had cast a powerful spell allowing you to let go and truly believe in this world and story.",1279929600,4,1443,4.4541984732824424
4114524,4,B003ES5JDS,"I want to start off by saying that my all time favorite film is The Dark Knight. That said, this movie takes the Gotham Nolan created and brings it to its animated roots. All the way down to the train that Batman fought Ras Al Ghul on, in Batman Begins. Now for the movie at hand, Under The Red Hood is a great addition to the collection of animated comic book films. The dark, gothic presentation is perfect. The pacing is perfect as well. This one is a bit longer than usual. It's still only an hour and fifteen minutes, but I thought it was perfectly paced, and ended when it should. Under The Red Hood is more mature, and that's what we want when it comes to Batman. Superman can be childish, but Batman is supposed to be mature. This movie reminded me of Marvel a few times. First of all, the Red Hood himself looks a lot like Deadpool (my favorite comic book character). He also reminded me of Daredevil when he and Batman faced off on the roof of a church.

There was another villain in the movie by the name of Black Mask. He looked exactly like Red Skull from Captain America comics, except his face was black. And he ran the crime in Gotham like the Kingpin runs Hell's Kitchen in Daredevil comics. There was also a brief fight between Batman, Nightwing and a Superman-like android called Amazo, who happened to do the Hulk Smash. He was also very much like the Terminator. He rises out of fire with half of his metal face exposed and a bright red eye. All of the times they did something like that, which had already been done, I considered it homage. There are some nice winks to other sci-fi flicks. in a positive light. So, there's another Marvel reminder.

The action was great. It was a bit over the top and unrealistic, but it's a cartoon. Why not do things that couldn't be done in live action? They really took me out of it though, because there were a bunch of explosions (some of which the characters were actually inside the exploding building), yet no one seemed to get hurt by them. A few scratches on the face aren't good enough. I'd expect dismemberment from the kinds of punishment the characters went through in this movie. Of course, it is a kid's movie at heart, so they can push limits, but not too far. There is a bit of mild profanity, so I wonder who the target audience is. I'd think it would be older fans, like myself. But the mix of mature subject matter and violence with unrealistic physics and explosion damage is a bit immature.

Either way, the negatives really brought the quality of the overall film down. If it were not for the unrealistic explosion damage and people jumping from buildings across the street (like Marvel's live action adaptation of Daredevil), I would have given it a 5/5. That's how much it took me out of the movie. I'm ranting, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. The writing is actually very good. There was a good amount of humor, even though some of the more juvenile jokes fell flat. Also, the fantastic mystery aspect of most Batman movies (he is the world's best detective) didn't last very long. We find out who the Red Hood is way too early, but hey. It's not a long movie anyway. I also think fans will be satisfied by the long list of characters who make an appearance.

The Joker, the Red Hood, the Riddler, Ras Al Ghul, the Fearsome Hand of Four, Amazo and Black Mask are all of the villains that make an appearance. Don't worry though, they are balanced perfectly. Batman, Robin and Nightwing are the heroes that make an appearance. Of course, what is a Batman movie without Alfred? He's in it too. I loved the connection to the Gotham that Chris Nolan created. There were a few scenes very reminiscent of scenes in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. If you've seen those two movies as many times as I have, then you should spot them right away. If not, then oh well. The score was another aspect that was directly linked to Nolan's. The music in this movie was very much like the music in The Dark Knight. Some of the musical themes were identical. So, all in all, I really liked this one. I got the blu ray, but just noticed that my review is for the dvd. Anyway, the blu ray is perfect. Lots of worthwhile features, amazing video and audio. Get it!",1279929600,3,4241,4.412515964240102
4114525,5,B003ES5JDS,The raw emotions that you will feel after watching this film make it worth the price tag. Even if you are not a fan of the series this dark and complex story will leave you wanting more. I am not going to spoil the story like some of these reviewers did. Just buy it.,1279843200,15,267,3.962962962962963
4114526,4,B003ES5JDS,"I'm glad that this short is getting such rave reviews. My question is what is the Amazon-exclusive full-color animation 3"" x 5"" litho cel that is excluded as an extra? Is it really a cel used in the production of the movie...or  just a re-creation a cel used as a gimmick to trick buyers into spending $3 more than the regular Blue-Ray version of the DVD? Answers please?
  I would like to second the request an earlier reviewer suggested that DC has to make their animated films longer if they are going to make the experience truly satisfying for the many older-fans who are buying them. I realize that the excuse they may offer is that kids have too short an attention fan for a 2-hr cartoon, but I suspect that the real reason is that it's just cheaper to make a short film than a full-length one....and yet they still get to charge the same prices! You can full some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time but......",1279843200,,951,4.331460674157303
4114527,4,B003ES5JDS,"This was truly the batman cartoon I've been waiting for, for so long.  The story ran smoothly and seamlessly.  I will admit that the first scene Joker's voice was a bit off putting, but it eventually grows on you. Having NPH as Nightwing worked surprisingly well. Jensen Ackles was phenomenal, I can't think of a better person for the part. Animation is also really well done",1279843200,,375,4.666666666666667
4114528,5,B003ES5JDS,"I have to classify this movie as a minor masterpiece.  I give most of the credit to the screenwriter.  Hollywood's live-action superhero movie producers and writers can learn a lesson here about how to write a screenplay properly when creating comics-based movies.  The problems have always been the fact that there is a big audience that knows the stories and a large audience that does not know the stories.  The major comics-based movies are all tainted by the supposed need to explain everything and introduce characters to those who know nothing.  Likewise, they have to depart from directly adapting the beginning, middle, and ending of previously published stories - no matter how good the original stories may be.  These supposed limits have resulted in a long string of mediocre live-action superhero movies.

However, this script deftly and effectively provides all necessary backstory and context so seamlessly and effortlessly that I have to wonder why the big studios never tell the story and make the movies the way it is done here.  That this movie is animated is no explanation.  With all the advances in live-action, this identical movie could be made with actors, sets, special effects and CGI no problem.  The tools of movies are not the problem with movies.  It's always been the writing that limits comics-based movies.

All the Batman fans are familiar with the story and know all the spoilers.  That problem is dealt with masterfully by the script by weaving it into the tale early on.  The 50 years of comic history Hollywood would tediously explain to a new audience is dealt with perfectly using brief, in-context flashbacks, imagery and dialogue that never interrupts the story.  The professionalism and polish of the script is in ""Casablanca"" territory.  Every line and scene moves the story, nothing is left out that is needed and nothing is put in that isn't.

The voice acting is good.  The actor playing the Joker is the best Joker voice yet.  I have no idea how Andrea Romano is able to cast these DC animated movies so well and keep picking the right voices.  Not a false note among any of the casting choices.  The characters here ring true to form.  I think they really got this one right.  The Marvel animated producers and creators are put to shame again.",1279497600,20,2293,4.868217054263566
4114529,1,B003ES5JDS,Why couldn't they get the real voice cast to do it?  The joker's voice in particular is just awful.,1279324800,14,99,4.2105263157894735
4114530,5,B003ES5JDS,"DC animation admittedly can be VERY uneven. Bruce Timm, as much as I am grateful for his stewardship of most of Batman: The Animated Series, and the Superman animated series can really bite the big one. I'm not a fan of the Doomsday, or even the New Frontier adaptations, and innumerable other projects he's taken on.

But here, he knocks the ball out of the park. The animation is first rate! Dark, moody, and with the right kinetic feel to make it seem like a comic book come to life. Like something that could only exist in animation terms.

They stick close to the original story (with a few minor variations, which serve the story, as a stand alone, outside of continuity, quite well), and the script is by Judd Winick, so I'm glad for that.

The music serves the story very well. The acting, for the most part is first rate (I'm an actor, so please forgive me for nitpicking this part).

Bruce Greenwood takes over the role of Batman (look him up on imdb, you know him, yeah you do) from Kevin Conroy, and sounds almost exactly like him! Which is not a bad thing. He does a really great job! Kinda feel bad for Kev, who otherwise is the only guy that should be allowed to play the role, but hey, if he had a sore throat on the day... Bruce did a bang up job!

Jenson Ackles (the pretty boy from Supernatural) does a very pretty boy job of playing the the Red Hood. And, ok, I realise he has his fans, but I just don't think he's all that. I think they cast a name, and I think they could have done better. He doesn't suck... but he's helped by a really good script!

Neil Patrick Harris plays Nightwing... Not bad, not great, too small a role to be great at. He serves the story well and my only comment is ""when is the next Dr. Horrible coming out!""

The Joker, as played by John DiMaggio is frankly week! But he's not in enough of the movie to be a detriment. Still, they should have stuck with Mark Hammil.

But for all the nitpicking and whatnot, I gotta say... this is a first rate animated feature, with as much balls as the format will allow.

I saw an interview once with Bruce Timm, where he joked that his core audience was a bunch of thirty and forty year old's who still read comics. If that's true, why don't you write and draw for the adult mindset instead of saturday morning cartooning it? Instead of sanitizing it, in other words.

This one almost feels like he's playing to that core audience he joked about. It's well worth adding to your animated collection, and even though I've seen ad advance copy of it, I can't wait to add the 2 disc version to my collection ('cause I'm a geek and I like all those bs features and documentaries that come with them).

If you want, wait 'till the price goes down (it's a tough economy we're stuck in) but put on your wanted list, it's worth the wait!",1279238400,3,2814,4.28060263653484
4114531,5,B003ES5JDS,"I was so pleasantly, incredibly surprised by  the pure awesomeness of this movie.

Bruce Greenwood has done the impossible and manages to do an even better Batman voice than the legendary Kevin Conroy. Greenwood is magnificent.

I love all the violence, this is certainly not your Saturday morning cartoon for kids. I LOVE all the characters that make an appearance, and the story is great. This is bar far the best animated production we've seen from DC, the best animated Batman movie they've ever made-- even better than Mask of the Phantasm.",1279152000,7,545,4.9021739130434785
4114532,4,B003ES5JDS,"I was prepared to dislike the new DC direct-to-dvd animated film, Batman: Under the Red Hood.  I've been annoyed with these animated films for a number of reasons, some admittedly nitpicky and petty, but annoyances just the same.  However, after watching a review copy I was quite pleased with the way it worked out!  Having read the original story arc in the comics, I wondered how they were going to take such a complex tale, one that draws on various Batman stories going as far back as 1951, and roll it all up into a neat little self-contained package lasting under an hour and 20 minutes (short running time--another gripe of mine).  The answer is, quite deftly!

The story has to do with the Batman's greatest failure, the sadistic, violent death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, at the hands of the Joker, who began his career as a masked criminal known as the Red Hood, which is established in short, succinct flashbacks.  The story begins five years after the death of Jason Todd and involves a criminal turf war between the Black Mask, an aggressive and entrepreneurial mob boss who wears a black skull mask, and a new masked criminal--a new Red Hood.  This new Red Hood is trying to clean up Gotham by controlling the gangs, and his methods are violent, ruthless, and murderous, and thus he comes to the attention of the Batman.  A showdown is inevitable, but who's manipulating who, how will the Black Mask react, and what role does the volatile Joker play in the plan?

The story is action-packed, very dark, and should make casual viewers and fans quite happy.  Some gripes; Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio turn in terrific jobs as the Batman and the Joker, respectively, but I really wish they would have gotten Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to play the parts.  Those two actors are so well associated with the roles and it would have been quite interesting to see how they would have handled such a dark and violent story.  Sometimes the violence is kept to a nil when it should be amped up.  For example, the death of Jason Todd is fairly unbelievable; the Joker spends a good deal of time beating him with a crowbar, yet afterwards he looks only as though he fell down and scraped himself up a little.  The comic book story, A Death In the Family, regulated by the Comics Code Authority no less, showed blood, bruising, swelling, a shredded costume, and made him look more than half dead.  The movie fails to convey this, and when they're dealing with a PG-13 rating they could certainly have done better.

Another big problem I have with this film, and the DC direct-to-dvd movies in general, is the short running time.  Again, with a PG-13 rating and such dark and complex stories, it's more than obvious that the intended audience is NOT young children and pre-teens, but rather an older, more mature audience.  So why the short running times geared towards the short attention spans of young children?!  This film runs one hour and 15 minutes.  The last film, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, ran only one hour and 13 minutes.  Please, DC, PLEASE--know your audience and realize that the vast majority of people purchasing these films are adults who can keep track of sophisticated plots, complex character development, and running times that are closer to those of adult movies--an hour and a half to two hours!  If you did that, you could do so much more with these animated films.

Depsite my gripes, I have to give this movie four out of five stars.  It was very entertaining, with lots of action and some seriously twisted moments from both the Joker and the Black Mask.  Parents, please take note from a fellow parent:  just because this is an animated film, that does not mean it is suitable for young children.  Please take the PG-13 rating seriously.",1278892800,102,3788,4.67420814479638
4114553,4,B003ES5JDS,"Honestly this movie is amazing. There are only a few critics that feel warranted. Joe DiMaggio is an okay Joker but Mark Hamill is the best Joker voice actor of all time and it sucks that they couldn't get him on the project, some of the other voice actors are just odd choices. Overall for such an iconic DC animated movie it would have been nice to have the huge names in DC voice acting not just famous actors because they wanted to appeal to more people. They didn't do a bad job it just doesn't feel like the animated films you grew up with. The plot, story-telling, camera work, and animation are all stellar though. This is still a must see for all DC fans. If the DCEU could produce films half this good they wouldn't be talking about a Flashpoint reboot.",1524009600,,763,4.3426573426573425

4114560,4,B003ES5JDS,"Aside from the opening scene the movie was a little slow early on and I felt like some of the scenes and some of the actions of the characters were a little stupid. But on the bright side the ending of this movie was intense and thought provoking. Overall, I'd say it was a compelling story that most viewers would enjoy.

As a side note, seeing Robin in a speedo was...not good, fortunately it didn't take away from the movie too much haha.",1518220800,,441,4.313253012048193
4114561,4,B003ES5JDS,"""Under the Red Hood"" plays as if it might fit into the same continuity as the ""The Killing Joke"" movie, which portrayed The Joker as an early Red Hood prior to becoming The Joker--and it even flashes back to that storyline.  That said, the animation style of this film is quite different.  While ""The Killing Joke"" took its style cues directly from The Animated Series (and could arguably fit into the TAS/DCAU continuity), ""Under the Red Hood"" exists in a (just slightly) parallel universe in which The Joker, often drawn as slender and even lanky, this Joker is rather brawny.  But don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here.  The Red Hood of this film is NOT the Joker, but a new villain/anti-hero whom Batman must use his detective skills to unmask.  Once revealed, one could also see this film being kind of sequel to TAS were it not for the fact that Batman Beyond takes this same character (the alter ego of Red Hood) down a very similar, but different direction.  Still the parallel is close enough that it almost fits.  Recommended.",1514592000,,1042,4.6923076923076925

4114577,3,B003ES5JDS,"While not the worst Batman movie I've seen (the fight animation alone holds it from being as bad as Son of Batman), it's painfully average at best.

The Red Hood story, as headlined, is great. One of the best stories to come out of a comic. However, this is bogged down by horrible writing, including below par dramatic lines and simply awful comedic moments, often forced into a scene where it doesn't belong.

The voice acting is a mixed bag, with no help from the pre-mentioned writing. While Bruce Greenwood and (surprisingly) Jensen Eckles are able to work through the awful writing and give genuinely great performances, John DiMaggio and (especially) Neil Patrick Harris are left to suffer. As a huge Nightwing fan, and a decent NPH fan, this is the first time I wanted to sock Nightwing across the face whenever he spoke. They substituted charm for obvious exposition, which is nothing short of awful.

Lastly, the animation. I absolutely loved it! If I could watch this with no words out of anyone's mouth, I would rate it a perfect score. Everything looks fluid, and the action kept me at the edge of my seat.

All in all, I am glad I gave this movie a shot so I could see that it's far from perfect. I just wish we'd eventually get a stronger adaptation of the story.",1509235200,,1278,4.567685589519651

4114580,5,B003ES5JDS,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe may be running circles around it's rival DC counterpart in live action film (excepting the Nolan Batman trilogy), but DC's animated universe has (almost) always provided fantastic stories and characters that easily rival Marvel's best.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Avengers, Guardians 1 & 2, Civil War, Ant Man, Deadpool, Winter Soldier, Logan, etc. (after some early -- and even recent --  flops like the Hulk movies, most of the X-Men series, and Iron Man 2 & 3), but ever since DC's fantastic New Frontier, the Distinguished Competition has been quietly putting out thoroughly enjoyable animated fare for home viewing.  Under The Red Hood, Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker are personal favorites that rival Marvel's best.  Of course, DC set the stage for the super hero renaissance with Batman the Animated Series, Superman and the Justice League Series.  Pity that DC has abandoned quality television fare by catering to the toy market with abominations like Teen Titans Go -- a sad shadow of it's predecessor series -- and the preposterously boring and visually grotesque CGI Beware the Batman.  Here's hoping that Wonder Woman sets the stage for a new DC cinematic universe that respects the source material and, in particular, reshapes a morose characterization of Superman that must be fixed before DC can compete again on the big screen.

Under the Red Hood may be the very best of DC's animated movies.  Even without the iconic voice of Mark Hamill as the Joker, this is a cinema-quality release that probably should have been a live-action movie.  Expert direction, a collection of truly menacing villains including the under-utlilized Black Mask and a creepy, bloodthirsty Joker set the stage for one of the most compelling viewing experiences among all super hero releases.  The writing is impeccable and the voice acting is outstanding.  No spoilers here, but for Batman and DC fans, this is a must-see feature that is best enjoyed via a modern home theater, with plenty of bombastic action, flawless animation, and a compelling plot to justify the usual collection of bombastic explosions and violence.

4114591,5,B003ES5JDS,"Batman: Under the Red Hood was the first DC animated film I saw years ago, and it remains the gold standard for this impressive series. An outstanding mix of tense drama, effective acting, quality writing and direction, and excellent animation, it's a great introduction to the serious side of the film series (as contrasted with the more comical and 'fun' films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Harley-Quinn-Blu-ray-DVD-UltraViolet-Combo/dp/B01LBHSBUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman & Harley Quinn (Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet Combo)</a>). A narratively-rich film, it explores some of the darkest and most mature aspects of the Batman mythos with the gravity and moral complexity they deserve. For those familiar with the original comics, the story is significantly altered for cinematic purposes, yet effectively visualized and brought to life; for those who are new to the story, coming in with the least possible foreknowledge and expectations, as I did, leads to the greatest rewards.

While the DC animated universe has always treated its subject matter with respect and sophistication (even when having fun with it), Batman: Under the Red Hood adopts a particularly cinematic approach. It stands confidently with DC's live-action efforts as a film to be taken seriously, and benefits immeasurably for it. Viewers unaccustomed to animation delving into dark, adult-centric material may be surprised; this is just one of the many enjoyable discoveries in this film. The action and drama are well-balanced, each complementing the other and elevating the film into one with broad appeal that extends beyond the comic book crowd.

This was the first DC film to be animated by Japan-based The Answer Studio, and their outstanding effort on the film shows in its moody visuals, exciting action scenes, and nuanced moments of physical acting. Unlike in lesser animated films, each of the principal characters has his own way of moving, whether while running, fighting, or simple posture. Close attention to detail has been paid in each standout sequence; any time a shortcut could be employed, the animation instead goes for something hard and visually-dazzling to take its place. The hand-to-hand and physical combat remain among the best in any DC or Marvel animated film, and the action scenes are as thrilling and intricately designed as in a live-action blockbuster. The quality animation, delivered by such noteworthy animators as Kazuyoshi Takeuchi (animator on such anime classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira-Movie-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00ENNA62W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira: Movie (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;and Your Name), immeasurably adds to the film's effectiveness. Such is the excellence of the animation that one wishes all the DC animated films could be produced by The Answer Studio; the quality is so much better than most of the other studios that it really stands out. As it is, the films that are animated by them all stand out as among the best.

Finally, the top-notch voice acting from Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood, Bruce Greenwood as Batman, Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing, and John DiMaggio as the Joker, along with the rest of the cast, expertly handle and elevate the difficult material. Ackles' Red Hood in particular is so good that it's a shame he and the character have not appeared in subsequent films.

As a group, the DC animated films deserve a wide audience beyond comic readers; anyone interested in quality storytelling and thrilling action (animated or otherwise) has much to enjoy and discover here. And there's no better place to begin than with Batman: Under the Red Hood. If this outstanding film doesn't make you excited to check out the rest of the DC animated universe, nothing will.",1502668800,3,3853,5.615120274914089

4114640,4,B003ES5JDS,"I liked this movie. I was very resistant to get into anything with the resurrection of Jason Todd so held off quite a long time on getting this. I still haven't read any comics that have this Red Hood in them in anything but a very passing level. From what I've read of the comics I think this adaptation is a better adaptation of the story, at least for me.

I think all of the recent Batman animated movies have been very well done. The only one I couldn't stomach was the one introducing Damon Wayne and that's solely because they totally punked out Deathstroke and massively over wanked Damon Wayne as Robin. Otherwise the story and animation and voice acting and were very good.

The animation and voice action are good in this movie and I think they improve on the comic story by updating it a bit.

I think that they do a good job in explaining why Jason is back and his issues with Batman (and everyone) are completely within what I remember of his character. I can grudgingly say that maybe it wasn't a mistake (from a writing/publishing standpoint) to bring him back.",1478476800,,1077,4.456852791878172

4114660,5,B003ES5JDS,"This movie is a wonderful demonstration that animated Batman isn't only catered to children. It's got the right amount of action and great writing that the older audience can appreciate. The animation is top notch. I wish superb animation like this would be released in mainstream theaters. Traditional Animation needs to make a comeback to mainstream movies. Batman is handled greatly, Nigtwing is handled just as greatly, Robin/Jason Todd is the same little punk we all grown to know, The Joker is handled as phenomenally as ever, and it's an incredible gateway to Red Hood's charcter. Bruce Greenwood does a great job as the voice Batman. He'll most likely shape up to be a perfect successor to Kevin Conroy. Neil Patrick Harris does a fantastic Nightwing. The nice guy tone that knows when to be serious really does it for me. Alexander and Vincent Martella are great as Robin/Jason Todd. Alex provides the optimism of Jason's younger years, while Vincent provides the rebellious attitude of Jason's teenage years. I never would've expected this kind of voice work to come out of the voice of Phineas Flynn from Phineas and Ferb. One would be VERY surprised to hear the Jester of Genocide be voiced by Bender from Futurama and Jake the Dog from Adventure Time himself, John DiMaggio. Though it's very uncommon for The Joker to have a deep, gravelly voice, John managed to provide his own, astounding take on him that works superbly. Jensen Ackles as Red Hood was a great choice. He's got the right vocal inflections and depth that fit perfectly with the crimson-headed vigilante. The music is amazing. Sounds a lot like The Dark Knight Trilogy mixed with the DCAU's music.

To conclude, Batman: Under the Red Hood is an awesome addition to the DC Animated Original Movies' lineup.

If you love Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Gotham Knight, or The Dark Knight Trilogy, then you'll love Batman: Under the Red Hood",1475020800,,1921,4.907692307692308

4114696,5,B003ES5JDS,"Jason Todd,  the second Robin, is my favorite DC character. It's sad that he's been so horribly written/depicted for the past...forever. I highly recommend this movie and the comics it's based off (batman under the hood,  along with red hood,  the lost days). This movie,  while not a perfect rendition of the comics, is incredible. It's deep,  it's gut wrenching,  it's emotional. Jason has been forever seen as the Bad Robin by the DC writers who have all failed incredibly at writing this scarred and emotional character. In my humble opinion,  no one but Judick,  the writer of BUtH, has ever done Jason justice. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone who stands still as A Batman Must See (along with the comics ofc). Jason is a very key character in Bruce's emotional development, though many writers often forget that. I love his sense of justice,  very different from Bruce's, because it depicts so well the class differences between them.  Bruce, a rich privileged man who whose sense of morality can afford to be as high as it is. Yes he's been and survived through trauma and studied crime and immersed himself in it,  but he's still very much not a victim of the crime and poverty of his city. Jason, however, who was born poor and to a broken home,  and who survived his first decade in the worst parts of Gotham as a child, truly understands crime as any poor citizen does.  I really love the differences between them,  a Hero who doesn't kill and believes in redemption, and a Hero who has lived through the horrors and gutters and come out damaged but no less wishing to do good the way he knows will help.  Jason is a Bruce willing to get his hands dirty to save his city,  and I honestly find that more engaging than Bruce's methods,  that while noble,  really are only small fixes to bigger problems.  If you're a Jason Todd fan and find darker heroes interesting,  than you definitely will love the movie.",1467072000,,1931,4.574344023323615

4114717,5,B003ES5JDS,"DC Entertainment has been doing a fantastic job with its animated series of films. And with 'Under the Red Hood', you can count this one up there in the Top 10. The animation is great, the character selection for the story is exactly what you would want from the original comic book story, and the voice actors make it well worth the ride (Bruce Greenwood as Batman is actually not bad, though I always prefer Kevin Conroy). But let's not forget the additional feature that only adds to the experience here. DC Showcase: Jonah Hex is included with this disc, and is a beautifully done western story of murder and greed, ending in sweet justice delivered by the amazing character Jonah Hex voiced by Thomas 'Punisher' Jane. Add to this Linda 'Terminator' Hamilton voicing the deadly brothel madame, and you have quite the adventure ahead of you. I definitely wanted more Jonah Hex after this one short.

Pros...
Writing is good
voice acting is good
the concept is ok (as compared to many other recent Batman stories)

Cons...
animation is a little choppy
Lets face it, in order to be surprised by the villains identity you have to have read enough Batman to know what is going on, but be completely oblivious at the same time and that is the crux of the whole story...yeah, hence the 3 stars

A stand out vocal performance by John Di Magio as The Joker is just one of many reasons to check this one out.",1442275200,,444,4.235294117647059

I'm a huge fan of the ""Under the Red Hood"" arc in the comics. It was the first Jason story I read, though I was also familiar with ""Death in the Family."" This movie does an excellent job of translating UTRH from page to screen, even though this movie makes me feel literal pain.

Watching a child go from ""being Robin gives me magic!"" to what Jason became is gut-wrenching. Ugh, it hurts but it's such a good story. Watch it, read it, buy it. You won't regret it.",1441238400,2,635,4.031746031746032

The voice acting was very nicely done! Bruce Greenwood makes a nice hardened, tough Batman and John DiMaggio makes a pretty psychotic and witty Joker (although my heart will always be with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, respectively.), but Jensen Ackles steals the show as Red Hood! He captures the hot-headed, violent nature of the character incredibly and makes me want to see more of him!

It certainly helps that Judd Winick (the author of Under the Hood) is the one that wrote the screenplay for Under the Red Hood.

Although tempted to do so, Batman understands that if he ever stoops to the level of his enemies... he will destroy everything he stands for.

DiMaggio did an amazing job showcasing the manic nature of the Joker through his tone and attitude while voicing the character. And as for the Red Hood himself, the movie displayed how far off the deep end he was when he finally confronted Bruce about their past.

Batman has a couple allies, which is fun.

Frankly, the story is well-written and executed well.  Voice acting is terrific.  I am always surprised at how much better DC's animated movies are than big blockbusters.

Even though we don't have Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill contributing as Batman and The Joker, I think that Bruce Greenwood(Batman/Bruce Wayne) and John DiMaggio(The Joker) do a very good job.  Both are decent representations of Batman and The Joker.  We even get a decent performance out of Neil Patrick Harris(Nightwing/Dick Grayson) though he's not in the film as much.

4114881,4,B003ES5JDS,"Originally written 7-29-10

After an encounter with the Joker ends tragically, Batman returns to Gotham City. 5 years pass, and there's a turf war being waged between a wealthy crime lord called the Black Mask, and another crime lord named the Red Hood. However, Red Hood also acts as a vigilante with intentions on cleaning up Gotham City, but he doesn't follow Batman's ethical code, and he uses excessive force. His violent tactics have put him at odds with Batman. But what exactly is Red Hood after? -summary

This movie borrows heavily from two Batman storylines: A Death in the Family and Under the Hood. Fans of the comic will more than likely have an idea what's going to happen. However, despite having some knowledge of the storylines the plot is constantly moving to keep the interest level high. Even the character interactions can be very entertaining when the action finally takes a back seat.

The first thing I noticed about the movie were the visuals. The animation is not of the same anime style as Gotham Knight. It's more of the traditional Batman: The Animated Series style which I was very glad to see. The visuals are impressive when delivering some very fluid and incredible action scenes. I mean wow, the creative juices were flowing when it came down to the combat.

The choreography at times is like poetry in motion. The battles move with such grace that small details could be missed during the hand to hand exchanges, if one doesn't have a quick eye. The action scenes also didn't contain the slightest amount of re-used cels, and the animation was still fluid during battles taking place with multiple characters. The eye candy doesn't end there. I also think the CG and 3D blended in quite well during the high speed vehicle chases. One thing is for certain, the action junkies are going to feel their money was well spent.

Normally, a great soundtrack can bring out the best in most mediocre action scenes. However, it's the reverse in this case. The top notch action scenes actually help the soundtrack. Now don't take this the wrong way, I don't exactly find the BGM which was done by Christopher Drake to be bad; but it sounds way too similar to his other works with very little variation. The artwork and character designs are very consistent, and appear to be a step up when compared to Batman/Superman: Public Enemies and also Green Lantern: First Flight.

I'm sure someone is wondering by now, ""is the action all there is to this?"". Not at all, at least I don't think so. The character development and characterization are very good as well. I won't spoil the things Red Hood does; but his character is portrayed as someone whom means business. In his first appearance, it's obvious he is not someone to fool around with. He caught my eye rather quickly and I enjoyed his antics.

Casual fans whom are not into the comic will probably get an idea on why Batman has such a huge following. He's by far one of the most human characters in comic books, and the way he deals with his failure is so realistic. The Joker seems to be quite different here. Unlike his usual character in the animated series, where he's depicted as being insane,as well as a clown with a sick twisted sense of humor. Here, he seems to be based off of Heath Ledger's Joker; sadistic, unpredictable, and very violent.

This is the area where some diehards will probably feel sour about the film, and it happens to be the voice acting. Now, the voice work is solid overall, but there is slight inconsistency at times that I was able to pick up, mainly concerning Batman whom is voiced by Bruce Greenwood. Still, I think he does a good job. Fans of the Joker will probably miss Mark Hamill, but John DiMaggio grew on me rather quick. This version of the Joker had the sinister voice to match his actions.

I have small issues with the film. I think everything was too spelled out and predictable. It was no secret who was under the hood obviously; but I think his intentions were too easy to catch. I also noticed at least one awkward story element that had me scratch my head a bit. In addition, as good as the action scenes are they can be a bit too highly exaggerated, with these regular people performing moves at a superhuman level.

This part isn't exactly a con for me personally, because I prefer my dark superheroes to be in a dark atmosphere; but this is mainly a heads up for certain individuals. Although this is a cartoon that is based on a very popular superhero. I don't think it's child friendly at all. The dialogue can be quite violent at times along with the action. There are graphic deaths here with people being shot and blood splattered on the wall. The death scenes aren't as over the top as most anime series, but I think parents should know that it's present.

Overall, I was heavily impressed by this film. It gave me what I wanted and then some. It does have its flaws and of course they will vary from person to person, but this is something that is staying in my collection and DC in my view continues to dominate Marvel in the animated department.

Pros: Action packed, dark, violent, very good sound effects

Cons: Very predictable and too spelled out, inconsistent voicework, not child friendly",1427760000,,5238,4.6133190118152525

4114890,1,B003ES5JDS,"Humorwas flat in this film. Lots og one-liners felt like bad sit-com garbage, mostly coming from Nightwing. Last the plot was just done so badly. Most of this film is just fighting, the intimate moments of the original comic book story-arc were brushed aside such as Todd taunting Joker because he knows he isn't as crazy as he thought he was and dismissing Black Mask (who looks like a low-rent pimp in this movie) as just another thug with a gimmick. The biggest plot hole had to be Jason's plan to free the Joker from Arkham Asylum. How would Jason know Black Mask would recruit the Joker to stop him ? In the comic it made sense, Jason found the Joker and just kidnapped him. Why even place him Arkham at the time ?",1424563200,,719,4.373134328358209

The documentary for Dick Grayson was also very enjoyable, and if your a Nightwing fan like myself, you could buy this 2 disc just for that. What else can I say but if your a fan of Batman the animated series or the animated universe in general, than this is an excellent continuation, or if like me you wanted to see a little more young justice, than this is good for you too since you have the same director and some of the same voice cast.",1422403200,,781,4.507042253521127

4114933,5,B003ES5JDS,"This movie is definitely one of DC's best, hands down, no arguments.
While it doesn't stick to the Cannon version of the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin, but rather goes with a different arc, in which Ra's Al Guhl brings Jason back from the dead via Lazurus pits, it is simply amazing!

I love how they've weaved the story, adding in characters like Dick Grayson (who made the move all the more awesome) and really protraying the Joker as a very sick, sick maniacal person.

I know a lot of the fans didn't like Jason as Robin, but he totally kicks butt in this movie, and it really covers a lot for 90mins.
And it has the best ending...that was just heart wrenching.

So, if you like Batman, Jason, or just a really well done, action packed, epic movie, this one is for you!

I am not a huge fan of the graphic novels, but I am a fan of good movies, and this is one of them. This movie shows the death of Robin (Jason), at the hands of the Joker, only to later come back as the Red Hood. It is really enjoyable, yet sad, to see Batman realize that the new vigilante trying to take over the city is none other than his once trusted sidekick. This movie was very well done and it shows how Batman struggles with himself day in and day out when he lets another criminal live, but only does so because crossing that line would be too easy, and probably impossible to turn back. Overall, this movie is very emotional but with plenty of action sequences, and even some suspense when trying to find out who this Red Hood is. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Batman.",1407974400,,811,4.266233766233766

I have viewed Batman: Under the Red Hood about 50 times and it gets better after each viewing.  As it pertains to story line, action, adventure, pain, suffering, guilt, love and a host of other emotions, this movie is perfect.  The voice over actors' interpretation of the scenes is so full of emotional context.  You will never regret adding this movie to your collection.  In fact, I do not know why they have not gathered this team together again for a sequel or to depict another epic adventure by Batman.

As you watch this movie, remember that Batman (Bruce Wayne) could be The Red Hood at any time.  Therefore, the Red Hood is an extension of who Batman could have been.  Also, Nightwing (Mr. Chatty) is the person Batman desires to be as a person.  This was a perfect contrast of characters.

My only gripe is that Nightwing is a love or hate character in this because of his cheesy lines that seemed to have been written for an eight year old audience which is in stark contrast to the somewhat mature theme of the movie.  Saying that though, others that I've watched the movie with thought these campy lines were funny and entertaining so keep that in mind for what you like to have in your serving of Batman.

I, like several others, do miss the original voice actors for Batman, the Joker and particularly Ra's Al Ghul;  Bruce Greenwood did well, I'm just used to Kevin Conroy, and after Mark Hamill's classic Joker, it was a bit hard to get that ""Joker"" feel from John DiMaggio, but John Isaac's Ra's Al Ghul was the most difficult to swallow as that particular character.  He was a bit too mundane for such an epic character.  The animation was BEYOND gorgeous.  The fight scenes were incredibly executed.  I was especially impressed at just how elegant Nightwing's acrobatics were at the beginning of the film, they were just as wonderful as I had always imagined his moves would be.  The essence of these characters through the script, the voice actors and the fantastic animation was truly captured with an accuracy I had never expected they could be.  A fan of Batman and his allies for over twenty years, this movie really propelled Jason up into my top 5 favorite DC characters.  I would be thrilled to see more like this in the future.",1405209600,,1194,4.752427184466019

I also had to get passed the Bladerunner-esque Gotham, complete with blimp, as well as, The Dark Knight soundtrack. All that being said, it's still a very enjoyable watch. The movie moves along without any lulls. Great fight sequences. The Black Mask villain even manages to upstage The Joker with funny one-liners as he chews up the scenery.

In this offering, Robin plays such a complex character, and his relationship with Batman is almost a character of it's own. The first scene, has Joker beating Robin down hard with a crowbar.  Blood everywhere.  It was pretty powerful, and it really set the tone for this dark story.

As you would expect - THIS IS NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN.

I give it 5 stars because it was so good, that I refused the boot-leg copy and bought it for real.  The creators need to keep making animation like this.",1399593600,,637,4.294117647058823

4114980,5,B003ES5JDS,"Unlike the other Batman films I had seen at the time this came, this was excellent. It wasn't a sloggy mess like Batman: Gotham Knight, nor was it clogged with way too many characters like Superman/Batman Public Enemies, nor was it badly drawn like Batman vs. Dracula. This film was just right. It was well-drawn, had an understandable plot, a tense drama, a gripping story, yet made sense. The Red Hood comes to Gotham to clean up the town--lethally. To Batman he is another crime lord that needs to be taken in. It turns out to be Jason Todd, the second Robin, the one everyone assumed the Joker had killed. Ras al-Ghul had hired the Joker as a distraction for Batman t odeal with while al-Ghul pursues his own plans. But Ras felt sorry for Batman and decided to resurrect Jason Todd. But like the Frankenstein of old, Jason Todd after being resurrected becomes psychotic. Jason Todd becomes Red Hood and takes down Black Mask's gang. Black Mask becomes so desperate that he releases The Joker, who, naturally, wants first to kill Black Mask. But Black Mask survives. And it eventually comes down to Batman, Jason Todd, and The Joker, and an argument about morals why The Joker should die or shouldn't die. It finishes with everyone surviving. Only minor characters get killed. Joker, Jason, Batman, Black Mask all survive. And of course Ras al-Ghul, who blames himself for creating the situation and so has renounced crime and vows not to bother Batman again. All in all a nice story.",1399334400,,1487,4.723076923076923

Jensen Akles brings The Red Hood to life with his now expected humor and charm ( even for a phsycodic vigilante ) you find yourself rooting for the Red Hood.

Spoilers ahead~~
It starts with the Joker beating and killing the second Robin (Jason Todd) and although little to no blood is shown, it is defenitely not for children. I was surprised to see how violent it was (especially when the Joker kills Black Mask' henchmen and when Red Hoods assassins get his/her face blown off) but I really enjoyed it. I also liked the Jonah Hex short. This movie gave me a different opinion on DC animated movies because of its intense violence.

Unfortunately, I didn't wanna be this guy, but this seems to be the way with all things...the books were better. Don't get me wrong this was a great movie, but if you haven't read the comics go out and get them.

Pros
-Great Animation (I enjoy the new Anime-ish drawing style DC is doing with their new films, but if you enjoyed Batman: The Animated Series, you will love this)
-Great Voice acting (The only people I could really Identify was Neil Patrick Harris and John DiMaggio but everyone did a great job, I really enjoyed John DiMaggio's Joker, and actually caught myself letting out a scary joker laugh at one of his jokes.)
-Very Engrossing (I was sucked into this movie the whole way)
-Adult (You could call this a con if your a parent looking for a movie to entertain your child for about an hour, but if you're like me and feel like kids get enough super hero Saturday cartoons then you will really enjoy the PG-13 limits they take.)

*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS******SPOILERS******SPOILERS******
If you have not read the comics or have seen the movie do not read the following! The Cons I have is with story lines.
*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS******SPOILERS******SPOILERS******

Cons
-They left out Tim Drake (I understand why they did this, these are supposed to be able to be viewed by anyone, so if you threw Tim Drake in there, they would of had to add another 15 minutes of goons tied up doing commentary on Batman's fight explaining back story.)
-They left out the Blonde Chick that double crosses Jason (I can't remember her name, but I remember she double crossed him only to get double crossed by the Joker, and after all that Jason still saved her. It really showed how good of heart he was even though he was really brash, with out it, all we get is a little scene of him as a kid jumping around acting innocent so we are supposed to assume he's really a good guy.)

All in all it isn't a deal breaker, this is still an amazing film, go out and get it if you're a Batman fan.",1392681600,,2091,4.538461538461538

4115005,5,B003ES5JDS,One of the best of the current DCU animated movies. Great story line; excellent performances by the cast; more adult oreineted,1391990400,,126,5.0476190476190474
4115006,4,B003ES5JDS,"This is one of the more graphic and disturbing movies put out by the Warner Brothers animation studio. Please do take the movie rating seriously and screen this for yourself before letting a younger child watch it.

The movie opens with a desperate Batman racing to rescue Jason Todd, Robin, who has been captured by the Joker. The Joker has taken Jason to a remote location (Sarajevo), savagely beaten him, and then left him for dead with a ticking timebomb. Batman arrives just as the bomb explodes and, after frantically searching through the rubble, in a moving and iconic image that is straight from the original comic book story, holds a limp Jason in his arms.

The movie jumps forward five years, as we're introduced to the title figure, who is threatening a meeting of the largest drug dealers in Gotham, telling them that for 40% of their profits, he will protect them from Batman and from a would-be crime kingpin who has been taking over the gangs of Gotham, the Black Mask. To show them what he can do, he throws a duffel bag on the table, a bag containing the heads of their top lieutenants.

We then switch to the other main protagonist of this movie, as Batman intercepts a gang of hoodlums who have hijacked a shipment. The truck crashes and the shipment, the super-power-absorbing android, Amazo, is freed. With some assistance from Nightwing, the threat is defused. Batman interrogates the thieves and finds out that they are working for the Red Hood and that the shipment was intended for the Black Mask. Before he can learn more, the three men are all killed by sniper fire. Batman takes off in pursuit of the sniper and tracks him down to the factory where he first met the man known as the Red Hood (from a very old Batman story). This new Red Hood blows up the factory, effecting his escape.

Finally, we are introduced to the last member of our cast of characters: the Black Mask, the crime boss whom the Red Hood appears to be personally targeting. His crew is making arrangements for an arms shipment while the boss gripes about how the Red Hood is eating into his organization. Unfortunately for the Mask, we see that both Batman and the Red Hood are listening in.

The Red Hood steals the shipment but is stopped by Batman and Nightwing. The resulting chase sequence is innovative and thrilling, with some very clever work on the part of the Red Hood to get away. The Red Hood taunts the pair as a train passes by, masking his final comment. Later, at the Batcave, Batman filters the train sound out to hear that what the Red Hood actually said was, ""You haven't lost your touch, Bruce!""

We then flash back to Batman and a very young Jason Todd as Robin taking on the Riddler, followed by a seamless transition to an older Robin taking on, and brutally beating, a gang of thieves. An angry Batman dresses down an unapologetic Jason, who insists that the crooks deserved what they got.

Back in the present day, the violence between the Black Mask and the Red Hood escalates, with each of them attacking the other's businesses and underlings. The Black Mask sends some of the best super-powered assassins in the business to take out the Red Hood, a trap that he evades with the assistance of Batman. Finally, the Black Mask gets desperate and he seeks some very special help, help that ultimately backfires on him. To reveal any more would be to give away too much of the plot. Suffice to say that there are some surprises and interesting plot twists ahead. And that the story behind who the Red Hood really is and how he came to be is thought-provoking. My only complaint is that the ending is a bit unsatisfying, with part of it unbelievable and the rest of it ambiguous. There is no nice clean resolution here.

I give the story top marks on this one. The Red Hood is someone that Batman could easily have become if he had allowed himself to cross that line. The dilemma about what should happen to psychopathic criminals like the Joker is a very real issue, something the Batman, and every hero, faces every day. How many people has the Joker killed? How many times has he escaped? Wouldn't it really be better if Batman were to simply have killed him on their first meeting? But if Batman crosses that line, what would he become? Is it really appropriate for someone like Batman to be judge and jury? To become a killer, even if it's in a good cause?

The animation is excellent, with some very good sequences and an appropriate dark and brooding look that fits well with the movie's mood. Occasionally, the CGI sequences were a bit too obvious and didn't blend seamlessly in with the hand-drawn animation but not so much that it takes you out of the story. I had only one objection: they gave the Joker more of a craggy look with high cheekbones that didn't really match the look I've grown accustomed to.

The voice acting is a mixed bag. I thought Bruce Greenwood did a good job as Batman, while Neil Patrick Harris was a surprisingly effective Nightwing. The supporting characters were also fine The two voices I had trouble with were, unfortunately, two of the critical voices for the movie. Jensen Ackles, as Red Hood, just didn't do it for me. It wasn't a terrible job but it sounded like he was overdoing it, forcing his voice so as to try to sound tougher. And John DiMaggio as the Joker really bothered me. I'm not going to claim that Mark Hamill is the only one who can be the voice of the Joker but John just didn't pull it off, in my opinion.

Overall, I found this to be a disturbing and thought-provoking movie, one clearly aimed at adults and older youths rather than young kids. The action sequences were superb, the story engrossing, the animation excellent. I have to quibble about a couple of the voice actor choices and the ending but even with that the movie is still a solid 4, perhaps even 4.5, stars and I can definitely recommend it.",1391817600,,5893,4.55

4115026,5,B003ES5JDS,"I consider myself only a 'casual' superhero fan, meaning that I have never read or plan to read comic books. Instead, I just watch all the animated films and television shows and swoon over how awesome fictional men in tights kicking butt are.

When Batman: Under the Red Hood came out in 2010, it somehow slipped under my radar. But I spotted it on Amazon Instant Video and decided it was about time. I definitely wasn't disappointed.

On the aesthetic side, this movie is amazing - the animation is smooth and fluid but doesn't direct attention to itself, meaning that it complements the story rather than overwhelming it. Watching Batman and Nightwing battle together at the beginning of the film was epic; they're comfortable around each other, and it shows in the way they anticipate and build off each other's moves. I remember in particular the long arching shots of them swinging through the air after Batman's line gets cut and Nightwing catches him... that part just about made me pee my pants because of how well it was rendered.

As far as plot, it was just as exceptional, though I can't really summarize without giving everything away. This is probably the best in the Batman animated collection so far. Even if you know nothing about Jason Todd and Red Hood, if you enjoy Christian Bale gurgling through a 10 minute scene, then you will learn to prefer these guys, trust me. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Batman and the Joker from the animated series) aren't present here, which made me kind of sad at first, but once the story got going that didn't even matter. John Dimaggio did an excellent job as an older, but still crazy !@#$#!$ insane sociopath, and Bruce Greenwood was an excellent heartbroken, guilty father-figure.

4115050,5,B003ES5JDS,"I just took a look at the 2010 DC animated film, Batman: Under the Red Hood, to see if it still held water after a few years, and stands with the rest of the DC animated film line. I must say, I think it still holds up pretty good.

Most of why this film works is because of the creative team. It was directed by Brandon Vietti. He has done a lot of Batman work, including Young Justice, The Batman, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, but sadly, not on the original and perfect Batman: The Animated Series. Moreover, the screenplay was written by Judd Winick, who also wrote the comic book storyline that this film is based on, called Batman: Under the Hood, which ran in the Batman series back in 2005. So we know that the creative team has considerable experience dealing with the Dark Knight, so we should get a pretty faithful adaptation here, and we do. Years after the death of his sidekick, Jason Todd a.k.a. Robin, Batman is still battling underworld crime in Gotham City, which is run by the mob boss Black Mask. However, things get shaken up when a new upstart who has taken the mantle of the Red Hood starts taking territory and influence away from Black mask. Things get personal for Batman, when it appears that the Red Hood may in fact be Jason Todd, back from the dead. To make matters worse, Black Mask hires the Joker to help them take care of both the Dark Knight and the Red Hood. And it all comes down to a fateful showdown between the bat, the clown, and the boy.

The animation and art direction for this film is again, pretty good. Like most of these DC animated films, the art style is pretty similar to what we are ready got in the DCAU, but just different enough to tell that this isn't the same universe and were getting a different story. The action throughout this film is very good. I can tell what's going on and who's fighting who. In particular, I was very impressed with some of the acrobatic animation that went along with the Nightwing and Jason Todd characters. The original animated series could never get away with animation that was that crisp and that fluid, but they pull it off in this film very well, mostly because it's got a much larger budget. There are some very good shots of Gotham city in this film, and I get a much better sense of how large and bustling this city is, and there is also some fairly decent CGI with the vehicles, including the Batplane. There are a few flashback scenes that hearken to an earlier time of comic books. The design and colors here look more akin to what we would've seen in the Silver Age of the 1960s, sort of like the old Adam West series. The henchmen have their own outfits that follow their still in boss's gimmick, and the Dynamic Duo have their earlier, more colorful costumes from that era. However, there are a few hiccups in the overall art design. I'll say that Bruce Wayne looks kind of odd without the Bat cowl on; his hair looks like some sort of Army sergeant's crew cut, which I have never pictured Bruce with. The opening credits leave much to be desired, as they look like what is real-life video with some grainy Photoshop filters over it, which isn't as good as it sounds. The end credits are also similar to this, but with only one continuous shot of rain falling on a city street. For a very interesting movie, it's got very un-interesting bookends.

The characters and their voice actors are very well done in this film, for the most part. This film sets a pretty good tone right off the bat, with a pretty intense and gruesome opening scene of the Joker beating the second Robin, Jason Todd, with a crowbar. Right away, this film establishes that it is dark and gritty, even more so than the animated series (which, in case you didn't know, this film is not in continuity with). However, Jason is portrayed here in a way that shows that he is not helpless or without dignity. Later, there is a very good introduction for his new persona, the newest Red Hood, which immediately establishes that he is skilled, and a threat to both the criminals in Gotham City and a physical match for Batman. A lot of what makes Jason Todd so good comes from his voice actor, Jensen Ackles, who does fantastic. He perfectly delivers the seriousness of what's happened to the character, as well as his cockiness and sense of humor. Also, in the flashbacks were he's a teenager, Vincent Martella (whom you will probably most recognize as the voice of Phineas from Phineas and Ferb, and Greg, young Chris Rock's only white friend from Everybody Hates Chris) performs decently as the angsty teen Robin. However, was far more impressed by the performance of his younger brother, Alexander, as the very young Jason Todd, who was able to get across the characters joy and excitement about his new life as a superhero sidekick. One of the best performances in this film is from the legend-(wait for it)-dary Neil Patrick Harris, who takes over the role of Dick Grayson/Nightwing, who was also the first Robin. I get a real sense of Dick's lighthearted attitude, which contrasts well with Batman's more sullen disposition. I'd say this was a case of perfect casting. Bruce Wayne's trusted butler, Alfred, is also good. I will admit that his voice actor caught me off guard for a second; he sounds almost just like the original. In fact, I had to look it up. It's not the original, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., but rather Jim Piddock, who does very good, as evidenced by my initial confusion. Also appearing as a side character in this film is one of Batman's greatest enemies, Ra's al Ghul, voiced here by the great Jason Isaacs, who does phenomenally well. Isaacs displays all of the qualities that I've come to expect from the Demon's Head; he is cool, calm, elegant, not without honor, and believably remorseful in this story. Isaacs' British accent is back in full force here and it works well with Ra's al Ghul, conveying his class and aristocratic demeanor. However, not every performance was a home run, in my opinion. Wade Williams did fairly well as Black Mask in trying to convey what they wanted the character to be like in this film. However, I think the problem is their approach, not particularly Williams' performance. Here, Black Mask seems more like an angry gangster akin to Tony Montana than an in-control crime lord. He comes across as a petulant child, in my opinion. However I did very much like his assistant, Ms. Li, voiced by Kelly Hu, as a levelheaded aide who doesn't bat an eye at her boss's tantrum-like behavior. Also the android Amazo makes a brief appearance towards the beginning, although I can't explain why he looks like a buff Namor the Sub-Mariner here, but is appearance does get cooler as he sustains battle damage, giving off a very Terminator-esque vibe.

In the end though, what the acting comes down to are the performances of main hero, Batman, and the main villain, the Joker. And here, both do . . . okay, but not great. I'm probably being too critical here, because in my mind, both actors are matched up to previous performances that are near impossible to top. So, you could say that it's unfair to judge them as bad, only because they're up against an insurmountable wall. Bruce Greenwood (whom you know as Captain Christopher Pike from the new J.J. Abrams-directed Star Trek films) does objectively pretty good as Batman. But like I just said, he's not as perfect as Kevin Conroy was, but he is good at his own right. Greenwood can convey the repressed emotion of Batman, but not the same of authority and power that Conroy could pull off, both as Bruce Wayne and as the Dark Knight. Overall, Greenwood did well enough for this film, and he would later go on to reprise his role as Batman in the Young Justice series. My critique of the Joker's performance is pretty much the same. Here, the Clown Prince of Crime is voiced by none other than John DiMaggio, a veteran voice actor whom you have heard before as Dr. Drakken from Kim Possible, Jake from Adventure Time, and Bender from Futurama (throughout most of this film, I half expected the Joker to tell Batman to bite his shiny metal ass). Here, he does pretty good as the Joker, but again, doesn't give us the same perfection that Mark Hamill could do. However, he still does objectively very well. We get all of the good characteristics of the Joker that we've seen before; DiMaggio delivers very well the character's dark humor, irreverence, sadism, and madness, far better than some other recent voices for the Joker that I've heard. I'd say that as the voice of the Joker, John DiMaggio places as a solid second-best. Again, my opinion of these two performances is marred by the fact that I grew up with the original animated series, which remains in my mind as one of the best interpretations of these characters ever done, which is a hard standard to live up to.

The climax for this film is very well done. It is intense, suspenseful, has great action, and very good use of the characters' gadgets. It comes down to Jason, the Joker, and Batman in an interesting variant of a Mexican standoff. What makes this climax so good is that it contains a great discussion of the ethics and reasoning of Batman. You really get a feel of how Batman thinks and how that plays into his actions and how he deals with his enemies. Contrast this with the ethics of Superman, which are also very good, but very different, which plays into the differences of these characters but also allows for both of their greatness. Overall, this was a very good film. It had a compact story that was complex but not too difficult to follow. We got great performances from most of the actors, and there was a great ethical discussion at the end. This is a very good entry in not just animated Batman films, but Batman films in general.

The DVD extras here are pretty good. There the standard sneak peeks and trailers, and so forth. There are two pretty good documentaries about each of the robins featured in this film: Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. These documentaries highlight the histories of each character, and gives good insight on their similarities and differences and what made each character good in his own right. Also included standard with these DC animated films are a few episodes of the original Batman: The Animated Series, which on this disc are some of the best episodes from the entire series run, including Robin's Reckoning, the fantastic Mad Love, and the interesting The Laughing Fish. As per some of the recent entries in the DC animated films line, this one also includes as a bonus feature a short film, Jonah Hex. Don't worry; it has nothing to do with the live-action Josh Brolin film and this one is actually pretty good. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos and music by The Track Team, some of the guys behind the Avatar animated series and some episodes of Justice League Unlimited. There's good art design here, even better than the DCAU's version of the character, as well as good voicing by Thomas Jane as Jonah and character portrayal. What I've noticed with this and the other DC animated short films is that there less like adventures or battles, and more like ""A Day in the Life of""-type stories, which fits perfectly with the nature of the short films, and gets across what's good about the characters without overstaying their welcome. The short film is pretty good, in and of itself, but I'd do think that it's got kind of a cruel and dark ending, but then again I suppose it fits the character.",1373932800,,11499,4.5823215152986885
4115051,5,B003ES5JDS,"I loved this movie. Not for young kids, this was made for adults. Animation is top notch, the acting is wonderful, and the story is very well told.

4115052,5,B003ES5JDS,"UNDER THE RED HOOD is indicative of DC's brave choices in making these features. It is relentlessly violent. The Joker here is no less disturbing than Heath Ledger's performance. Admittedly the creators, writers and voice actor John DiMaggio(Bender of Futurama) were clearly influenced by Ledger's Joker both in look and attitude, but capturing it that well is like trapping lightening in a bottle. Joker's actions are also true to some of his more twisted acts in the comics, particularly his wanton murder of the second Robin, which jarringly opens the film. Also, heavily, but convincingly adapted, is the introduction of the Red Hood as one of Batman's most devastating adversaries. Credit is due Andrea Romano, who serves as voice director for almost all of these films. Perennial character actor Bruce Greenwood is perfectly cast as a seemingly older, emotional conflicted and often fatherly Batman. Jensen Ackles as Red Hood and Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing are solid if sometimes a bit overwrought. The dichotomy and parallels between Nightwing and Red Hood are expertly presented with subtlety both in dialog and actions. This is at once a dark and little known corner of Bat-fiction and yet is is presented devoid of oversimplification or over-explanation. None of which should be surprising from an animation division that knows and respects its subject matter and its fans. Nevertheless, these animated features cannot be dismissed as children's entertainment or cash grabs. They are so much more.",1371859200,,1513,5.282157676348548

4115058,5,B003ES5JDS,"I am not a die hard Batman fan of the comics (the reason being that DC has no idea how to keep themselves organized without the word 'Crisis' involved). That said, this animated feature is based on the pages of the original Batman comicbook, notably ""A Death In The Family"" (1988), and the original ""Under the Red Hood"". As an adaptation from the comics, I cannot criticize how far it strays from the source material or how well it stays true to form. This artwork seen here is gorgeous, and almost sets a new standard for what a cartoon should look like. The coloring on Nightwing, the shade on Bruce, and realism of nighttime Gotham's background.

What this does for a causal fan myself is entertain me using one of the different portrayals of the titular character. Death and Life are addressed, as are different philosophies in the wake of underworld crime and terrorism. Batman faces his greatest challenge in the film: to fight a long lost friend that he has practically embedded the best use of gadgets, combat, and recognizable resources to.

On a side note: while the Joker is the main attraction for any Batfreak or Batfreak pending, the crimelord BlackMask is not a very well known villain and this Blue Ray provides the perfect opportunity to get to know who he is, in an attempt to explore frequently unseen sides to the Batman Rouge's gallery. In the future that Batman takes a break from the classic villains, what you see here may or may not spike your interest.

Now for the voice acting: as a fan who grew up with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamills portray of Batman and the Joker throughout the 90's and afterward, I can proudly declare that the audience is put in very good hands when they listen to these different actors. John DiMaggio's Joker is something to celebrate as Hamill himself retired the role, and the Batman will always have a Joker. For those of you who want a more direct understanding, go to youtube and type in ""Don't give The Joker a Glass of water"" or think 'Evil Bender' from Futurama. It's the perfect advertising tool to whether or not you will be drawn to this film.

4115063,4,B003ES5JDS,"Batman Under the Red Hood is another film in the DC animated direct-to-DVD lineup. The last solo Batman film in this line-up was Batman Gotham Knight. I found that movie to be a disappointment, however, this film made up for it. I did not care for this film when I first watched it. However, when I viewed it again I loved it. This is definitely better than Gotham Knight. I even like this more than the Dark Knight Returns films. In fact this is probably the best film in the DC animated line-up so far.

Under the Red Hood is based on the comic of the same name. Under the Red Hood begins with the death of Jason Todd at the hands of the Joker. Then it cuts to years later. This new villain called the Red Hood shows up in Gotham in an attempt to control crime in Gotham. Batman needs to confront this new villain and face up to his past with Jason.

This film briefly covers Death in the Family and covers Under the Red Hood. The writer of the comic, Under the Red Hood is one of the people working on this film. I'm not familiar with the Red Hood comic. From what I hear it was not the best. Many people say that this is the definitive take on the Red Hood. From seeing this movie I can see why they think that. The writer of the original comic was involved because he wanted to make the story better, and many thought he succeeded. It is great to see someone get the opportunity to improve upon his work.

The voice-acting took some getting used to. I'm so used to Kevin Conroy voicing Batman, that this new voice did not immediately sit right with me. However, seeing the film again I like the voice actor of Batman. Bruce Greenwood voiced Batman in this movie as well as Young Justice. He does a good job as Batman.

Jensen Ackles, who voices Red Hood does a great job as well. I'm a fan of Jensen from the series Supernatural. The man has a wide range of acting talent. I wish he would get more work. Neil Patrick Harris does a decent job as Nightwing. Wade Williams as Black Mask was a lot of fun to watch.

However, John DiMaggio is probably one of my least favorite Jokers. He is definitely not up-to-par with Mark Hamill or Heath Ledger. I even like Jack Nicolson's Joker more. DiMaggio just did not sit right with me. I did not care for his voice, and I did not think he had any presence to him.

The animation is great, besides a few CGI shots. The action is great and engaging. Although, one action scene with a certain villain, I felt, was out of place in this kind of movie.

Overall this is a great Batman movie. If you are a fan of Batman and of the Red Hood comic, I highly recommend this.",1367452800,,2609,4.19560878243513
4115064,3,B003ES5JDS,"I'm not much of a superhero comic reader, and I'm not all -that- familiar with Batman. I've seen a few of the movies, learned a bit about him from friends of mine and from podcasts that talk about comics, and I was only a casual watcher of The Animated Series when it debuted in the early 90s. I keep meaning to read Frank Miller's stuff on Batman though, and I've had the Arkham games on my wishlist for a while. Under the Red Hood is a movie I've been meaning to see for a long time, ever since it first came out actually. Reviews for it were praising this as the best Batman-anything, calling it a dark film, accessible to anyone, even if they aren't versed in the world of Gotham City. I finally watched it last night, and from the opening sequence between the Joker and Robin, I kept feeling like I was watching a handful of episodes of The Animated Series, minus the great voice acting from Conroy and Hamill, and some of the suspense. It's tough to say if people just have low standards when it comes to animation these days, or if it's blind fanboyism that's doing the raving.

We start out with Batman racing to find Robin, who's been captured by the Joker. The Joker's got Robin tied up, and relentlessly beats him across the face with a crowbar, having fun like he usually does. Eventually, the Joker leaves, and before Batman can even get in the building to save Robin, BLAM! It explodes and the Boy Wonder is no more. Cut to 5 years later and the Joker is now locked up at Arkham Asylum, while Black Mask tries to control Gotham City. Unfortunately for him, a new guy's in town- Red Hood. He rules over all the other criminals through fear, and acting on his promises of killing anyone without a second's warning if they act up. Heck, even if they DON'T act up, he'll take them out. Red Hood is cleaning up Gotham City while still not doing the 'right' thing. Batman learns of this new foe after dispatching an advanced robot that was part of a shipment to Black Mask. As the days go by, Batman puts the pieces together regarding Red Hood's identity, while still being troubled by the loss of his sidekick. Meanwhile, Black Mask is getting fed up with Red Hood interfering with his plans, realizing that he's always one step behind. And so he decides to make a deal with someone legitimately insane who shouldn't have any problems with the situation.

At about an hour and 15 minutes long, Under the Red Hood never drags on. It moves at a brisk pace, with very few scenes without a fight or important dialogue. I even kept waiting for the obligatory ""my parents are dead!"" scene, and fortunately got no such thing! This movie is full of action and detective work, and most Batman fans are very pleased with the end result. There's not a huge cast of characters, so enough time is spent with everyone, from Black Mask to Nightwing to the Joker. We even get some good scenes with young Robin when Batman is having flashbacks of the beginning of his sidekick's career. Scenes like this are done well, and tastefully. They're not just put there to make you feel sorry for Robin or Batman, and serve their purpose. Animation-wise, Under the Red Hood looks very good for the most part, though some CG animated objects are a bit of an eyesore. I'm not one of those anti-CG nuts who rolls their eyes whenever they see it, or hear about a new CG movie, but what's used here doesn't look very good, and I can't help but wonder how much harder it would have been to just animate it like everything else.

So it's a pretty good movie in the plot, action and animation categories, so what's the problem? For me, there were two big problems. The first being the voice for the Joker and the other being that they were tame when it came to the violence. I'll get that second problem out of the way first here with a good example. In the beginning when the Joker is just wasting Robin with the crowbar, it doesn't seem like it hurts that much. There's no blood, no bruises, not even cringe-inducing sound effects to really send the message home. It seems like Robin's being hit with something much less deadly, like a plastic bat. There's another very good scene later on involving a certain someone's ""interview"" with Black Mask, where an object is used to cut the throat of someone. -As soon- as the glass swipes past the neck, the dude's hands are up, like he's choking, and again, there's no blood. Look, I'm not a gore hound (in fact, I get bored with how violent things like God of War are these days), but is there something wrong with adding some blood to make things a bit more real and serious here? The whole movie has the 'old western death' syndrome, where people would get shot and fall over, and that'd be the end of it.

Regarding the Joker's voice, I can't say anything bad about John Dimaggio, as he does seem to be trying to give a new take on the character. At the same time, it just doesn't sound right to me. He's too serious, and sounds like he's smoked a few more packs than he should. For this reason, I didn't like the Joker's scenes as much as I would have if say, Mark Hamill had been brought back to do the role. The entire movie, I just kept imagining how much more fun his Joker would have been here. Listening to the performance he gives, it sounds like Dimaggio was going for a mix between the Hamill and Ledger Jokers.

In the end, Under the Red Hood didn't impress me. It's a fun romp through Gotham City for me, someone who hasn't been there in a while, but could still be seen as maybe a three-part episode of a newer Batman animated series. Three stars isn't a bad rating at all. Though I'm sure plenty of fans are going to say otherwise with a healthy dose of 'No' votes for this review.",1366588800,2,5722,4.389255419415646
4115065,5,B003ES5JDS,"This is easily the most effective, engaging animated DC flick I've seen. From the animation, to the art, to the voice cast, and the ability to weave the best parts from the cinematic Batman universe into this crime drama. It is absolute class, and bests anything before it. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of the original animated series. But due to the direct-to-DVD release, and rating -- creative liberties were given that were not afforded to the animated series. It could easily be a companion piece to The Dark Knight.

Batman is not Superman. He needs to flirt with crime drama, psychological thrillers, and film noir. That is quintessential Batman, in my opinion. When his comic book gimmickry is downplayed, and you can treat him as though he were a police detective, as opposed to a dude flying around in a bat suit. It's almost as if all that (cars, weapons, costume) becomes window dressing, or a facade to lure kids to throw down money as opposed to the real crux of the character who is Bruce Wayne.

Many things in this film are treated with care, and respect. More so than other Batman fare. And maybe it's my naivety in regards to the comics this is based on, but ""AMAZO"" is the only flaw. After the film does a killer job at setting a somber, Batman-esque tone -- AMAZO happens. A ridiculous, cybernetic, super solider is thrown way out of left field to attack Batman, and Nightwing.

Imagine you're watching a show like ""The Sopranos"", and after a great bit of storytelling, and setting the ""rules"" of the show -- you're comfortable with the tone. Then WHAM, Tony Soprano gets hit by a lead pipe, and he is face-to-face with no one other than Swamp Thing who wants his crib back. But Tony, and his family are turning his mossy home into a waterfront cantina for drunken tourists that moonlights as a money-laundering scheme.

Doesn't make any sense, does it? The Batman universe is definitely broad, and has many supernatural elements (including the Pit featured here.) But does this particular film, focusing on the crime-driven narrative, and ideological battle between the Red Hood, and Batman really prosper from the robot with the elfin shoes? It's distracting.

But no matter, AMAZO's done in like 3 minutes, and you have the rest of the film to enjoy the incredible cast, art, animation, score, and storytelling that sets this apart from any other DC animated film. Five stars, highly recommended.",1366243200,,2426,4.752969121140143

4115080,5,B003ES5JDS,"I'm a little behind on my animated DC and trying to catch up so I can watch both parts of Dark Knight Returns back to back.

Under the Red Hood is a rough adaptation by Judd Winnick of his own writing on the comics title and if he has to rush things a little, he still hits all the key notes.

The opening scene is tough to watch. While not gory, the beating that the psychotic Joker puts on the Jason Todd Robin made my toes curl. It's certainly much stronger than we had seen previously in their animated material.

That dark and uncomfortable tone lingers throughout the story and definitely gives this a darker edge and I think a strength. The story itself is simple and the mystery of who is under the Red Hood is pretty much telegraphed from the beginning, because that really isn't the point. Rather what we get here is an exploration of Batman's failures and guilt.

Inevitably there will be some who complain that it's not Kevin Conroy or Mark Hamill doing the voices of Batman and Joker but I've actually enjoyed how DC have let other people try out their versions of these characters.

Bruce Greenwood's Batman has a bit of the Christian Bale voice without being so over the top, I found it effective for the story. It took me a little while to warm up to John DiMaggio's Joker at first, but as the story went on found his mixture of seriousness and manic hysteria ideal for a Joker who is as psychotic as any we've ever seen.

Similarly Jensen Ackles (as Red Hood) and Neil Patrick Harris (as Nightwing) effectively embodied their characters. Really there weren't any bad performances to my ear.

In fact the only weakness I could really point to was the way the Black Mask was portrayed which made him largely comic an ineffectual rather than one of Batman's most challenging opponents.

If you're worried about fitting this into comics continuity I can't really help you. It does appear to accurately reflect the A Death In The Family storyline where Jason Todd died, and at least one of the Joker's origins from The Killing Joke but how that relates to the current status quo is anyone's guess.",1359244800,,2109,4.531578947368421

4115089,5,B003ES5JDS,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies featuring Jason Todd. Not many characters unless popular such as the Batman or Superman have a movie. This one was pretty good for me who read the Death in the Family. I was hesitant to watch it but I did. It was amazing. I enjoyed the voice of Jason (Supernatural); the character was done well and I like the script. In my opinion it was done well. However do consider this movie is 75 minutes, this means that it is rushed. Overall it is a good movie.

The disks are better for me because I enjoy the Robins.

Disc one contains the move and trailers to the other DC movies.

Disc Two was good and disappointing. It featured Robin: The Story of DIck Grayson which explores the origin and evolution of the character. I happen to enjoy all the Robins but the problem was this movie is about Jason Todd who took over as Robin. The movie only gave you a small history of Jason Todd from his death to upcoming role as THe Red Hood. It also contains two Batman Animated Series episodes which feature Richard Dick Grayson.

The main reason I bought this is because I love the movie and it's the only animation featuring Jason Todd besides a cameo. Jason's background and history is probably one of the most tragic within the DC nation. All the Robins (Male) have been featured within the history of DC animation. Jason's had only  one other appearance which once a cameo in Young Justice. and it was not even for a full minute.

I've had this movie for a few days but I'm enjoying it and most likely I will probably watch this every week before DC nation or after.",1357430400,,1601,4.373737373737374

Kevin's voice would've sealed the deal for me as BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE. I wish the script was a little more longer because it is very, very good. But overall I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.

I didn't think this would be on par with them... but you know what, Under the Red Hood proved to be a way better movie than Apocalypse, Public Enemies, Doom, Wonder Woman. And I like the latter two quite a bit.  But the list goes on.

Under the Red Hood was not only dark but it was deeply emotional.  Not the kind of emotion that you have to try to feel - that manufactured emotion - but the kind that just kicks in on its own.

I've seen a lot of Batman in my time, and a lot of really great animation, but not quite anything quite as dark, as successfully paced, as beautifully animated and as carefully crafted as this.  At least not in a very long time.

Without giving up any spoilers, I will simply say that this very brutal tale gets to the depths of evil and permanence within the first five minutes before the pre-movie credits.  I found the voice of nearly all of the characters to be wonderfully selected.  As a huge fan of Futurama, I didn't even recognize that the Joker was played by John DiMaggio (in deference to some reviews I've seen saying it was distracting).  I found the Joker in particular to be very scary, very interestingly drawn and voiced, a terrifying and yet pathetic maniac.

*Edit* - I wrote the paragraph below before reading a review saying that the extras on the Blu-Ray edition stunk and are not remotely worthwhile.  So I guess having no extras is okay in this case. ;)

I am reviewing the Single-Disc DVD; at this time the only other edition is the Blu-Ray.  I have no interest in Blu-Ray personally, and am frustrated that there are no extras at all on this edition of the movie.  Not only is the Blu-Ray more than three times the cost of this edition as of this writing, but there's no reason the extras wouldn't have fit on the regular DVD; they're just not there out of spite from the publisher (the movie is about 70 minutes long, plenty of space left).  But that's really my only complaint.

Fantastic story weaving other stories of the Dark Knight, with bits I believe from the Killing Joke and other dark Batman tales.  Well worth a watch, just be prepared for something serious, and don't bring the young kids.",1351382400,,1795,4.53416149068323
4115111,5,B003ES5JDS,"As I was saying, if you enjoyed the animated series from the 90's or the Tim Burton style of dark/brooding atmosphere, you'll love this animated movie. I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone so I'll just say what I think makes this movie so good without giving away too much. In ""Under the Red Hood"", Batman is portrayed as a hybrid of the dark knight from the kid friendly ""Batman: The Animated Series"" of the 90's and the portrayal shown in Tim Burton's ""Batman"" from 1989. Both Batman and Bruce Wayne are portrayed perfectly by Bruce Greenwood. All of Batman's gadgets and vehicles (including the Batmobile and the Batwing) all very closely resemble 1989's portrayal while also blending elements of the animated series. The Joker appears in this a lot and is again a hybrid of Mark Hamill and Jack Nicholson's portrayals of the Joker and the blend is superb (although the new voice may take some getting used to at first). Nightwing appears here and his outfit and demeanor is much less out of place than Robin but he can still kind of make things campier than they need to be at times (luckily, he isn't a main character and isn't featured much). Robin is a secondary character yet he is the basis of the story (I won't lay out the plot except that this involves Batman's failed training of a second ""Robin""). I love the fact that this movie is PG-13 because it allows the story to be told in a way that it never could have if it were targeted to a younger audience. The reason it got the rating is that people die in this (sometimes brutally), they are tortured, there is more profanity, more talk about drugs and in-depth details of organized crime, and probably the fact that it's just much more bloody and dark. This movie has very few flaws though and I would rank it up there with some of the better live-action Batman movies (not to mention the superb ""Mask of the Phantasm"").

For die-hard Batman fans, this is a must buy.

For fans of live action Batman movies, take a look at some of the animated series shows or movies first.

For fans of the animated series, be warned that this is much more intense than what was released in the 90's or targeted to children back then with the straight to movie releases.

Not only did I feel this movie did a great job of picking the key elements from the comic story and making them work in the movie, they even had some parts where the dialogue was directly from the comic!! I was in heaven!!

The casting in this movie was spectacular for the most part! Jensen did a tremendous job voicing Jason Todd and Neil Patrick Harris most certainly owns Night wing as far as I'm concerned!!

I am a big fan of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, so its hard picturing anyone else doing their voices. Batman's voice never did quite grow on me and I still wish Kevin Conroy had done it, but John Dimaggio's Joker certainly did! From the first maniacal laugh on, he had me! I still always love Mark Hamill the most, but I was really impressed with John Dimaggio as well!!

The animation was also perfect!! It suited the tone of the story!! I really have nothing bad to say about this movie. Since buying it a few months ago I have watched it probably at least 50 times!

This is one of my favorite Batman movies. Period. This is just a phenomenal movie. :)",1350432000,,1219,4.259740259740259

The animation and the art style fit the gritty atmosphere of the story like a glove. I was disappointed at first that the movie lacked the tighter more intricate plot of the comic arc. (think some of the later Harry Potter movies.) But they did keep the weight and the driving force behind the characters alive and strong, particularly in the last few minutes of the story. In retrospect the comic book was such a hit with fans because it managed to bring out a different a side of Batman in a powerful and believable way. They definitely achieve that in the movie version. It did take me a while to get used to anyone but Kevin Conroy, and Mark Hamill voicing Batman and the Joker, although Bruce Greenwood, and John Dimaggio did fill the roles well. Jensen Ackles' portrayal as the Red Hood was especially good.

Seriously.  If you like Batman - even in the slightest - BUY THIS MOVIE!!

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen...note I said ""best movies"" and not ""best animated movie"".  It's that good.  The emotional depth in the story-line is fantastic.  The plot makes sense and is gripping.  The Joker, as always, is fantastic.  Although Mark Hamill didn't voice him, the voice still fit the story...and was quite menacing, to be honest.  Also, Black Mask kicks butt in this movie.

I'll rave on forever about how good this is, but in the end, get it.  Not only will it fill you in on the goings-ons of comics if your interested in getting into them, but it's an amazing movie in general.  Seriously, don't think about this one...buy it!

As a side note, the Blu-ray quality was fantastic, and definitely worth the few extra bucks.  The extras were equally as fascinating and good.  It really delved into the history of the character of Jason Todd in the world of comic books.  It also explored (in depth) the ""vote"" that went out to the public that ultimately decided whether Robin should live or die.  Great choice of individuals for the extras interviews - and totally amazing extras, that really fill you in on the history of the Batman comics in the 80s.

It's basically the Red Hood comic storyarc in animated feature format, but somehow it actually seems to work better in animation than in the comics. The dialogue just works so much better spoken than read in this case, I dunno.

The action choreography is by FFAAAARRRRRR the best out of any Batman film, bar-none. If you're a fan of ""punchy"" Batman you'll love this. If you're more into the detective stories, this may not satisfy as much (I'm actually a fan of the detective stories, so that tells you how amazing the action was in this one).",1346371200,,728,4.549618320610687

It was very disturbing but also gripping and inspiring to me as someone who wanted to be a storywriter- what the animated movie doesn't include is Todd's mother, and if I remember right she was allied with the Joker and Todd tried to help her,

Anyway, this was a great movie. Got me chuckling several times too- the Joker is the kind of villain I have a difficult time hating despite being a homicidal maniac! The animation is very well done- has a nice nostalgic 1992 TAS feel to it, which is a nice relief after seeing several experiments with different styles that is okay but not really as fantastic.

Only one thing irks me- I can't help but think of Deadpool when I see the Red Hood. But I understand it's impossible to design a character that doesn't somehow remind us of another one :) I won't hold that against them though.",1340496000,,996,4.378378378378378
4115131,5,B003ES5JDS,"...I just HAVE to write a review about this movie as it is one of the best I have seen in a long time...heck, one of the best movies I've seen, ever.

BACKGROUND--Major Spoilers ahead

I have always enjoyed comic books, the toys that come with them, posters, etc. However, I have never been too big a fan of the cartoons...just never really got into them as I thought (for example) the old 'Superfriends' were silly with the Wonder Twins and their pet monkey, Gleek, ridiculous plot lines, and such like.

'Red Hood,' however, caught my attention as many friends recommended it to me...but mainly that I know 'Red Hood' is the original alias of the Joker.

The name of the movie just sounded ...cool...so I gave it a look.

I. Was. Blown. Away. I had hopes, somewhat high ones, going into this that I would enjoy this cartoon, but I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.

There were no pet monkeys in this cartoon, by the way.

WHERE TO BEGIN?

Let's start with the voice cast: I understand most Batman fans were disappointed that the long-time voices of The Batman and The Joker: Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, respectively, were absent from this film, but I thought their replacements: Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio, did a great job. I've always liked Greenwood since seeing his portrayal of President Kennedy in 'Thirteen Days,' and I thought his Batman was spot-on, at least in my mind, of what the character should sound like.

DiMaggio was a good Joker...more Jack Nicholson than Heath Ledger, but Mr. Ledger's performance will never be duplicated so why even bother to try?

Neil Patrick Harris is great as Nightwing (Dick Grayson, the original Robin) as he brought humor to an otherwise very dark movie. However, he didn't have a lot of on-screen time, which is one of the few complaints I have with this film.

Wade Williams is Black Mask, the gang leader who is at war with The Red Hood. Over-the-top and quite funny (think the 1960s TV show), I enjoyed his performance.

Jason Isaacs is Ra's al Ghul. Isaacs gives the character a quiet dignity of a sort, mixed together with an authorative, self-righteous tone. Plus, Isaacs can do creepy quite well. Check out 'The Patriot' or 'Event Horizon' for further proof, if you need it.

Finally, Jensen Ackles is Red Hood/Jason Todd. I felt Ackles stole the show as he brought a dramatic intensity to his character that completely swept me into the story. The raw emotion he conveyed, particularly in a scene with Batman near the end of the movie...I cannot describe it, it was great. No, beyond great.

ANIMATION

I am not qualified to give technical aspects, but I thought this movie looked great. Gotham City visually looks like a mix of the Gotham City(s) from the Christian Bale and Michael Keaton movies--with a little 'Blade Runner' thrown in for good measure. The animation has an elegant flow to it...the heroes glide across the screen...and the only negatives I noticed were a couple of scenes in which characters are running and it (the running) looks kind of 'stop-motion choppy.' However, the visuals are quite stunning.

STORY

The movie opens with the Joker brutally killing Jason Todd, the second 'Robin,' as Batman arrives just seconds late to save him. The violence depicted is brutal, despite being shown off-camera, and definitely not for children.

The movie then jumps ahead five years and there is a new villain/vigilante in Gotham, killing any and all rivals who dare get in his way. He bargains with the Gotham drug dealers, telling them he'll protect them (mainly from himself) as long as he gets a huge cut--and they don't deal to children. This new villain is the Red Hood.

Of course, it is only a matter of time before he crosses paths with Batman, and if not for Nightwing showing up to help out, the Red Hood may very well have defeated Batman in their first encounter...as Red Hood departs, he yells something that causes Batman to take pause...playing and sound-editing back a tape of their encounter later, Batman realizes Red Hood called him, 'Bruce.'

Meanwhile, Black Mask is so frustrated with Red Hood's assault on his crime empire, he breaks the Joker out of Arkham Asylum hoping to enlist his help...which, of course, backfires. And, Batman discovers through detective work of his own that Red Hood and Jason Todd are the one and same...he then travels to Ra's al Ghul's lair and gets the details filled in.

Finally, the Joker is now on the loose spreading chaos throughout Gotham City, only to be captured by Batman, but 'stolen,' if you will, from Batman by the Red Hood. All of this leads to the film's climax where Batman and Red Hood debate their different perspectives of morality: Red Hood stating he ""is the better Batman"" because he *kills* criminals, thus ridding the streets of them for good. Batman's response is that, as much as he would enjoy killing the Joker, he realizes that if he ever crosses that line...""there is no going back."" At this point, Red Hood has brutually beaten the Joker and is going to kill him. He tells Batman (GREAT performance here by Jensen Ackles) he needs to make a decision on...

...well, get the movie and *watch* it to see how it plays out!

COMPLAINTS

They are minor, but...a short run-time, AND DEFINITELY not enough Nightwing/Neil Patrick Harris. As stated, his humor was much-needed in this gritty, violent film. True, Black Mask/Wade Williams was funny as well, but his humor comes while he is beating people up.

FINALLY

I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I really, REALLY enjoyed it. Just hurry up, DC, and release a Red Hood action figure!

4115132,5,B003ES5JDS,Definitely need to have in your DC movie collection. It's been too long since I've seen an animated movie this good. Brings 'A Death in the Family' back to life for a more modern generation. I just finished watching it and I'm pretty sure I'll be watching it again tomorrow.,1337990400,2,274,4.5
4115133,5,B003ES5JDS,"I really enjoyed Batman under the read Hood. It does have a bit of a dark story but the story does ask the question on how far can a person be plushed until they plush back. It questions the hero code of never killing the villian, which I myself find very interesting being a criminal justice major. I feel that this is a must see for all Batman and DC fans in general.",1336867200,,369,4.068493150684931
4115134,5,B003ES5JDS,"The character development is flawless, and you don't have to think too hard to realize how tragic this story is. Wonderful voice acting, good animation for when it counts the most ie: dramatic confrontations and fight scenes. Even the music was mood setting being dark, mysterious, and dramatic all at once, it was a great addition to any scene. I never for a second doubted the characters beliefs, reasons, actions, feelings, or realities because even with such a complicated twist in character; it makes sense. If you don't know what happens because you didn't read the comic, I suspect you're in for a surprise. If you know what's going to happen? You'll enjoy seeing the mystery unfold with the action and dramatic confrontation.",1334448000,4,733,4.967479674796748
4115135,5,B003ES5JDS,"This is the ultimate animated Batman film. Much respect for Mask of the Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Year One, but this was perfect. Excellent voice acting. Greenwood definitely gives Conroy a run for his money. This film is dark and gritty. Ut combines the comics with Nolan's vision. Brilliant. The action is nonstop and stellar but doesn't forget the characters either. It's heartfelt. DC Comics seem to come off a bit more for adults than Marvel for some reason. That's fine though. I still like Marvel, specifically X-Men and Spider-Man, but I lean more toward DC. Once again, if you are a true Batman fan, this is top notch. Note: Don't think this is a kids' cartoon and complain about that. This is for teens to adults. Enjoy.",1334188800,,738,4.684615384615385

4115137,5,B003ES5JDS,"Although I have enjoyed most of the DC comic dvds this one has me watching it over and over again. The voice actiing is great, the action cool (especially the Red Hood), there are twists and turns in the plot and the story deep - too deep for children. I have never been a rabid Batman fan and this film hit the core of my distaste - why does Batman not kill the serial killers that he has faced time and time again? Maybe it has been answered in the comics but in this film it is answered in a truly poignant, adult manner. The only problem is that I agree with the Red Hood! Regardless, if you like the gritty side of the Batman story is this by far and away the best story ever made.",1331251200,,686,4.014598540145985
4115138,5,B003ES5JDS,"I know many people have issues with the Joker's new voice. It is very different, but imagine this... The joker is older. It think it fit that sorta idea.
I really liked Jensen Ackles as Red Hood. He played it well with a sorta Deadpool twist. I thought that when it came to the serious parts he was able to switch really well.
The animation is very nice. I concur with Anelka24, '...This movie brings me back to the days where I would watch Batman Beyond or the first animated Batman series...'
IT has the dark mature feel, but isn't unnecessary. All the blood and drama fit in nicely and don't take anything away. If you like Batman, check this out!",1327795200,,650,4.380165289256198
4115139,4,B003ES5JDS,"First, some background information.  Batman has had four Robins over the years.  The first Robin, Dick Grayson, leaves Batman and later changes his crime-fighting name to Nightwing (with a new costume).  The second Robin was Jason Todd, who, well, you'll learn all about him from the movie (or from the other reviews.  Hey, just because all the other guys have spoilers doesn't mean I have to.)  Also, the Joker has had some slightly different origin stories over the years.  In some of the versions, he began his career as ""Red Hood,""  wearing a red metallic helmet which completely covers his face.  He was wearing this hood when he fell into the chemical vat which changed his skin and hair color, so Batman never knew who he really was.

The film begins with the Joker clobbering the Jason Todd Robin with a crowbar.  You don't actually see the crowbar hit Robin's head, nevertheless, this is a good reason for the movie to be rated PG-13, and you probably wouldn't want your younger kids to watch it.  Then a bomb goes off, and, um, we're in the present day of the film (many years later).  There's a new villain in town calling himself the Red Hood.  The major crime boss in Gotham is the Black Mask, and the Red Hood wants to take over his territory, apparently.  But that's not what's really going on...

I'm not a Batman expert, and I haven't read the original comics the movie was based on, but this story seems self-contained and you don't really need any more background information than what I gave you above for the story to make sense.  The animation is pretty good (better in some places than in others, as is typical).  Regarding the voice actors, I think John Dimaggio does a great job as the Joker.  He steals every scene he's in (plus he gets most of the best lines).  Jensen Ackles does a good job as Red Hood.  Bruce Greenwood is adequate as Batman, and Neil Patrick Harris adds humor to Nightwing.  (I get this vibe that Batman wishes Nightwing would just go away, which makes their scenes together amusing.)

I have two problems with the movie that keeps it from being a five star.  First, the Black Mask character just isn't very interesting.  Second, and more important, **slight spoiler** when Red Hood asks Batman The Big Philosophical Question towards the end of the movie, Batman's answer just doesn't quite work.  **end spoiler**

For special features, there are trailers for Superman/Batman Apocalypse, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Batman: Gotham Knight, Superman: Doomsday, The Lord of the Rings (Animated), the Jonah Hex motion comic, and Legend of the Guardians.",1327708800,,2606,4.748329621380846

4115141,5,B003ES5JDS,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT YOUR HAPPY GO LUCKY BATMAN WITH LITTLE VIOLENCE.  Before this movie, I was only mildly interested in the Batman comics/graphic novels and only viewed the cartoons because they were beautifully told and animated.  But once I watched it premier during the San Diego CCI I was floored and decided to look up the source, the Under the (Red) Hood run of the Batman comics.  Suffice to say, I am hooked on the comic books.  Though I didn't buy this in Amazon, I did buy a copy and would probably buy another in BluRay once I upgrade to that player.  The story closely follows the source but the addition of voices and action makes the story that much more effective than the comics.  It is so emotionally taxing and beautifully told that every time I watch it, which I've done multiple times, it still causes tears.  Just like all the DC animated movies and series, the animation and quality is top notch and the voices were beautifully chosen and handled.  This movie is all about the second Robin, the one that lives in infamy for being the only comic book character whose fate DC allowed fans to decide, and his heartbreaking return to Bruce/Batman's life.  The story is also a great intro to Batman's psychology and his relationship to his Robins.  This is my favorite of all DC animated features and is something that shouldn't be missed by any Batman fan.

The only thing I could see someone having a gripe over is hearing Bender (from Futurama)or Jake (Adventure Time) as the Joker.  It takes a while to get used to Di Maggio as Joker, but I believe his voice, especially the low rasps, does add a more sinister undercurrent to the character than Hamill's more cheerful sounding voice.

4115142,4,B003ES5JDS,"I honestly bought this for 2 reasons:  1. It actually (for real) follows the messed up sidekicks to Batman really are.  It shows how it's not Batman's darkness that makes a Robin go bad, but instead we get to learn that it is because of Batman's darkness that he is able to save a fallen bird. And 2. Jensen Ackles as Jason/Hood.

The action was tight. The script was excellent. Not too much monologing, just enough backstory for even the most casual of viewer.

Great for the tweens and the big tweens also.

This film has great action and great voices, a little Joker, all the trappings of a great Batman movie.  Now if they could just write a live-action script like this.  It was dark and disturbing, but it was supposed to be.  Not enough to give you nightmares, just a ""mmh"" momemnt for older fans seeing into the psyche of the ""Dark Knight"".  It's worth watching again and one more time. . .",1326412800,3,898,4.393939393939394

4115147,5,B003ES5JDS,"For Batman fans, this animated film is a solid buy. This film is for adults however seeing that the story lines from Batman ""A Death in the Family"" and ""Under the Hood"" are darker subject matter. PG 13 is a great rating and keeping that in mind if allowing younger children under 13 to watch this film.
Voice acting was great in some parts lacking in others. Bruce Greenwood and Jensen Ackles did a great job but for long time Batman fans, it's hard to not hear Kevin Conroy's voice when you see Batman.  The same can be said for the absents of Mark Hamill has the joker.  Replacing iconic voice actors is difficult. However, the solid story and directing allows you to forgive these shortcomings.
 The story was solid before it was a movie.  However, the adaptation of the comic and directing made sure the story was interesting and kept you on your toes. Has a fan I knew where the story was going but I was never bored or felt cheated by the films adaptation of the story. For comic book fans, you won't feel cheated!  For people not familiar with the story you will want to know more.
 If you don't have this film and you're a Batman fan I hope Batman comes to your house and throws a Batarang at you because it's that good.

4115148,5,B003ES5JDS,"To my surprise, this film has a great plot, and all the characters have believable motivations.  The action in this movie is well animated.  I have no gripes with anything movie-production related, except that Joker's voice is too normal sounding.

I had no familiarity with the red hood prior to watching the film, other than knowing his identity because I looked it up on wikipedia at some point.  I have not read the comic book equivalent of this movie, but after comparing the book synopsis online with how things went down in this film, I have to say the film seems to be the best way to experience the storyline;  It has much fewer stupid gimmicks than the comic books.

Buy this.  It's $5.00 for the single-disc currently, a lot cheaper than the $20 Under the Red Hood TPB, and the story is superior in the film.

EDIT: After reading the graphic novel of this, I can stand by my initial conjecture that this movie is more enjoyable than the book.  I still believe this DVD to be the definitive way to experience this storyline.",1322352000,,1034,4.545945945945946

I would put this one near Batman: The Dark Knight, but it is a different flavor considering its more based on the comics.  Its not the classic animated series joker, but he seriously does justice to the character.  It includes great one lines, especially from the joker, and touches bases with the least well known Robins.  Just an overall delight for any batman or action fan.",1319587200,,505,4.566666666666666

4115153,5,B003ES5JDS,"A Death in the Family. Go, read it now. We'll wait for you.

Alrighty. Now that that is out of the way, this is a DCU animated flick featuring a new villain, the Red Hood, busting in and taking control of the underbelly of Gotham. Comic fans most likely know this tale. But suffice to say, Red Hood is noticed by the Batman and visa versa.

Despite my reservations, the voice-actors are amazing. I didn't think Greenwood or John DiMaggio could pull their weight but I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking forward to Jensen Ackles entering into the DC animated films. I will say that Neil Patrick Harris did not get enough time on-screen; he nailed Nightwing dead on.

It seemed that DC just continues to make these productions better with each project. The special features are in line with what we've come to expect from DC's animated lot. But they did include a short film for Johna Hex, and it was very well done.

Batman fans should not miss this one. And don't count out the Joker in this one. He's a scene stealer.",1318982400,2,1023,4.483870967741935

Even though everyone Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill would have made this perfect, I still liked the voice for the Joker they chose, as it made his character a bit darker this time around.

The first thing that struck me was how good the animation was. (Mask of the Phantasm was an amazing movie but animation was found lacking) this one is well animated, deftly scored and voiced. True with DiMaggio (bender) rather than Mark Hamill as the Joker, it sounds a little off but after a while you get used to it. Under the Red Hood is a dark and brutal masterpiece of DC Animation and oh my gosh... it is beautiful just BEAUTIFUL to watch. I have watched it 10 times easily already and have not gotten tired of it. this is how batman should always be portrayed. HEAR THAT BURTON, SCHUMACHER, AND NOLAN, take notes.. the animated team got it right again, they started with Mask of the Phantasm, continued with the Mr. Freeze Subzero film and now topped even the great Nolan himself with Under the Red Hood.

4115165,4,B003ES5JDS,"I usually have pretty mixed feelings about the DC animated flicks - 2 or 3 stars, most of them - but this one is a cut above the others I've seen. Very nice animation, good voicing by the leads, fun action, a pretty literate script, especially for this genre. In the grand scheme of things, I suppose the story does not hold big surprises if you're at all familiar with the twists and turns and identity crises which typify these kinds of stories; still, within the context of the genre itself, it keeps things interesting, and reveals the twists in entertaining fashion. Also, kudos for a really great final shot. When a flick like this can actually evoke a sense of pathos, you gotta give it due credit.

WARNING: this movie is not for little kids. Lots of blood and violence, and people die. It is rated PG 13 for a reason.",1300665600,,826,4.434210526315789
4115166,5,B003ES5JDS,"When I first saw this come up on my suggestions I was a little skittish.  Most Batman themed cartoons/animations I'd seen except for one have stunk, but this one?  It blew me away.  The first thing to catch my eye was a favorite actor of mine in it, then the cast as their names went by before the title appeared; I had recognized almost all of the actors and actresses, all of them phenomenal no matter what challenge they had had before them.  The second thing that caught my eye was the animation itself.  Incredible.  I haven't seen animations this well done since the early 90s when I was little and Disney still had (although they have it back now) a cartoonist department.  Throughout this entire movie I couldn't get over how well done the drawings were.  Another plus for me was the editing, cinematography, and sound!  All  amazing in their own respects but as a whole did well together and really brought this cartoon to life.

I got sucked into the movie and really felt for each and every one of the characters.  The plot kept me interested from the moment the first image came onto the screen and has had me watching it everyday since.  And as I watch the movie again and again I have only seen it get better and better.  It continues to blow me away.

But if you are looking for a animated movie with strong character development and an engrossing story, this is strongly recommended. Without spoiling the story, it involves Batman and ancillary characters from the past and present. The plot development is good and the voice acting, excellent. There is probably more action than in the comic book arc to keep it an action offering.
It is also not an origin story like many other DCU animated offerings. So a minor primer on Batman and the supporting characters of Gotham would help viewers. This is also not for the squeamish as it pushes the boundary of what is acceptable for violence in an animated film with popular superhero characters.

I'm happy I did.

I found the movie to be entertaining and well put together.  On Blu-Ray it looks absolutely fantastic.

I don't know if fans of the comic books would be able to pick this one apart due to small inconsistencies with the comic franchise or not, but I do know that if you are looking for a good Batman movie that isn't live action (like ""The Dark Knight) I would highly suggest you give this one a go.",1297296000,,641,4.0476190476190474

To put it short, this movie is amazing because it has a(n):
1)Amazing plot, with an ending that will keep glued to your seat
2)a mature feel, although it's a cartoon the movie is made more enjoyable by making it a little more realistic with scenes of Batman getting whooped and occasional blood.
3)great dialogue, the characters stay true to Batman tradition
4)art style, the art style isn't too flashy with effects and gives the movie a dark/noire feeling.

My advice is if you are a superhero fan, consider yourself a superhero fan or even like superheroes to the point you see every live action movie release - you need to see this movie.

It will capture you from beginning to end and is worth every penny. I've watched it a few times. If you're going to pick just one DCU movie to see what they're about, this is the one.

So I like Batman when its fairly dark, and or serious, and this film is both. I did look up the Jason Todd story after I saw this, and I'm VERY glad they dropped the Superboy angle, that was just too awkward to swallow.  As for this movie, I loved it, the animation and music were great.  I wasn't too keen on John DiMaggio voicing Joker initially, but he grew on me.  His laugh was creepy! Bruce Greenwood had some serious shoes to fill as I'm a huge Kevin Conroy fan, I grew up watching Batman:TAS. But i think Mr. Greenwood did a great job, and i would be happy to hear him voice Batman again. Overall i think this is one of the best animated Batman films out there thus far.

Disc 2 gives you even more extras, which I always find interesting as you get to see an inside look at the story along with a couple episodes of the Batman Animated Series.

You MUST see this movie, whether you're a fan of Batman or not. I grew up watching Batman and he always had some gadget to deal with situation before him but nothing like this movie.

4115184,5,B003ES5JDS,"Okey, this is going to be a loooong explanation, based on this movie & the graphic novel it's based on.

This was way better than Dark Knight, even better than Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker & Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Gave me the warm-fuzzies. Thank gawd the movie was done by the same guy who wrote the comics.

Even though it deviates a lot from the story, & it's skimmed down, missing lots of characters, & adds distantly connected comic stories by other authors from different times, Winick managed to beautifly reimagine this story in a way that probably made more sence than the the comics.

Okey, like the opening part takes place after ""A Death in the Family,"" which happened in the 80s. There should have been a woman there, one claiming to be Jason's mom who lured him into the Joker's trap. I guess they didn't want to introduce a character who would never appear again.

In the comics, Batman never guessed who Red Hood was, he had to see him take off the mask, & even then he didn't believe it was really Jason. But this is taking from 3 different yet connected stories written many many years apart from eachother.

This movie didn't exactly follow the comics; Black Mask never broke Joker out of Arkham; he was already out & moping about in the abandoned ammusement park he used to use as a hideout, & Black Mask never hired him. Black Mask's personal assistant was a man. Jason DID die, & his resurection has something to do with Superman. One of Ra's Al Ghul's men spots Jason & reports him to Ra's & they take him in to discover the mistery of his ressurection. Againt her father's wishes, Talia Al Ghul pushes Jason into the Lazerus pit, restoring his memories of who he was & how he died, then she helped him escape (her father was pretty pissed). Also, Ra's never hired Joker in the begining, Joker was overseas of his own accord.

The universe in which Joker was the Red Hood was supposed to be destroyed in ""Absolute Crisis on Infinate Earths,"" so Winick oopsed on his continuity; everything that happened in the gold, silver, & bronze aged comics was retconed, but he used it for a plot device. The Joker's origin as the Red Hood was also unofficially retconed in ""Batman: Lovers & Madmen,"" the latest & longest Joker origin story. The Joker can also break out of & back into Arkham at his own liesure.

The ending also deviates from the comics. Jason threatens to shoot the Joker, Batman tosses a batterang at Jason, accidently piercing his neck. Joker sets of a bomb he set up. Batman does not grab Jason because he thinks he's dead, doubly so after the bomb went off, but all 3 of them escape (though it isn't shown). In the end, it was the Joker who got the last laugh. If you're wondering how the Joker set up a bomb, well, he's intop poisons & pyrotechnics & he's capable of Houdini stunts, like untying & tretying himself & getting out of handcuffs.",1294531200,4,2889,4.480988593155893

Donaldson, for the moral drama.  Batman: Under the Red Hood contains that element of moral drama in an animated film very appropriate for its subject.
I was a little skeptical at first, because Batman isn't voiced by Kevin Conroy; but Bruce Greenwood has a very similar sound, and was excellent in the role.  I thought a few of the Joker's lines were delivered very woodenly, and those stood out from what was otherwise a fine and creditable performance, and I will admit to cringing at young Robin; but other than that, the fine touch of Andrea Romano elicited very believable delivery.

Not that I don't love their films too but Animation should become a medium of story telling instead of simply a kids genre.
Anyway a wonderful film that really captures everything that Batman is. If you are a fan you will really enjoy this. As for the complaint about this film not being bloody or gory enough, I really don't see why it would be, it is not a SAW film, its an animated character driven Drama about the things that matter in a excellently told, emotions character development, empathy, and amazing animation.

To the creators of this film I simply ask that you continue to create these wonderful rich well made films and keep pushing the envolpe as far as writing! that is what great film making is all about!",1292630400,,1188,4.6571428571428575
4115191,5,B003ES5JDS,I can't say how much i love this movie batman is at his best in this film were he has to track down the red hood who seems to have the same type of training batman has. I do not want to give away to much but the plot is very well written and even though kevin conroy is not doing the voice of batman in this movie. the actor that does the voice is pretty good. I am gald to see that with these animated movies coming out that they finally get batman and superman right unlike that justice league show that ruined batman and superman were they treated them like they were nothing and nobodies.,1292371200,,592,4.068376068376068

4115194,5,B003ES5JDS,"I find it a bit sad that the animated Batman films seem to be much better than the live action films, but we seem to be saddled with that as a fact. Although I liked the two films done in the reboot, I'm not really tempted to re-watch them. ""The Dark Knight"", in particular, was so unremittingly tense, with no breaks whatsoever to give the viewer breathing room, that while I regard it as an excellent film, I have no desire to go through that again.

This plot in the animated film shows how to achieve the balance that ""The Dark Knight"" failed at. While the story IS dark and tense, there are humorous moments, especially from the mouth of Nightwing, that prevent it from pushing the viewer farther and farther down with no relief.

The story is about the rise of a new crimial, The Red Hood. This guy is fully as homicidal as the Joker, aothough his cold blooded killing seems to be reservered for Gotham's criminal elements. In fact, if it weren't for his cold blooded mass murders, one might well approve of his actions, as he seems to be pitting the worst and most powerful of Gotham's criminals against each other. When he proves seemingly superior in fighting ability and acrobatics to both Batman and Nightwing, questions arise as to just who this remarkable new man on the scene could be.

It is a mystery that Batman quickly solves, and the answer is just as shocking to the viewer as it is to the Batman himself. The solutions to the story bring us a rich plot that belies and surpasses the animated nature of the movie.

The animation is a visual treat, and contains enough frame by frame detail to make you forget it is animation. From backgrounds to facial expressions (even behind the masks), much attention was paid to making sure this came across as a rich environment.

The voices performances were outstanding across the board. Bruce Greenwood's as Batman is entirely natural and believable. As much as I like Mark Hamill, this Joker to me was a big step up. He came across to me much more believably as the sociopathic killer and sadist the Joker is made out to be, but has so often seemed forced in other performances. I was entirely captivated by the performances, without a break in the illusion of either the story or the animated format. That's hard to do, and is a credit to both the animation and the acting. It is a very mature story and set of themes which at once legitimately bring into question the Batman's methods, yet validates them. Again, that's a feat which is hard to accomplish in any film, and it is brought off here solidly.

I think anyone can enjoy this film. If you are particularly a Batman fan, then you'll enjoy it all the more.",1291248000,,2678,4.511340206185567

4115196,4,B003ES5JDS,"...but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this knock-it-outta-da-park addition to the ""DC Universe"" animated features! The only thing I truly hated about this disc set is Warner Brothers' infuriating ""half-assed"" keepcases! (just when we thought they'd learned their lesson with those gawd-awful flimsy-azzed ""snapcases"" -- WB's dvd distribution arm needs to be B*slapped 4Real!)

Any way, moving on from my rant about WB's shoddy-azzed ""product packaging"" -- as I've said, I've NEVER liked ""Robin"": I'd always felt Batman didn't need him & that a ""kid sidekick"" was too much of a hinderance to him... but I'd especially hated that gawdy-azz costume! But ""Under the [Red] Hood"" almost does the character justice!

Having long since moved away from being a comics collector, I was unfamiliar with the original story this feature is based on (with the exception of the death of Jason Todd, which I was still around for), but this entry is powerful enough all the same!

Despite how much I'd really like to move ""Superman & Batman: Apocalypse"" ahead to the #2 spot, in light of the action & moving drama of ""Red Hood,"" I just can't bring myself to justifiably do it.

Though the wrap-up for this one could've (and should've) been a lot better... and ""Amazo""???? (WTH? -- a whole who's who of baddies DC could've pulled up for the occasion, and they gave us ""Amazo""?) -- even so, I'm still placing this DCU feature right near the front of the line, just below the dynamite 5-star performance ""Wonder Woman"" feature. I'm very happy to have this as an addition to my personal DVD library!",1290902400,,1585,4.881040892193308
4115197,5,B003ES5JDS,The storyline cast and everything about this movie is fantastic. This is probably the best one I have seen to date. The character performance of the Joker was probably the most impressive and Jensen Ackles/Red Hood performance was also very well done. Overall this is an excellent movie.,1290297600,,287,5.0
4115198,3,B003ES5JDS,"I could tell by the trailers and teasers this was going to be much darker than past ""Batman"" animated endeavors. Sure enough, the opening cribs from the ""Death In The Family"" comic story, with Joker bashing the Jason Todd Robin up with a crowbar. I won't go into further detail, as comic diehards already know what happens next, but there are plenty of twists and turns in this story I don't want to spoil for the uninitiated.

The good: the animation is fluid and extremely well story-boarded. The action doesn't seem to let up for a second, and the voice work overall is really good. Nightwing appears, and they don't bother to bog the story down with explaining who he is. It's good to see Black Mask for once, though he doesn't do much here but chew scenery and punch out his guards.

The not so good: this is the same team that brought us the 90's Batman Animated series, but Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammill, the respective voices of Batman and Joker from that series, aren't back here. I can only assume they want to mark this release as a departure for the world of animated Batman (and since they grafted Jason Todd's origin onto Tim Drake aka Robin III in the latter seasons of B:TAS, what happens here already doesn't jive). It's also brutally violent: shootings, beatings, killings, and that's just the Joker. I guess this darker mood was telegraphed back in the ""Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker"" film, but even I wasn't expecting something this out and out violent. I'd never read the Judd Winnick comic arc this is based on, but there's a real dark undercurrent to this story. In short, it probably ain't for the youngin's.

I'm not sure why the developers settled on adapting this story over something like ""Hush"", but this film delivers well overall.",1289952000,,1766,4.635782747603834
4115199,5,B003ES5JDS,"Batman: Under the Red Hood is an intriguing look at the mind of Batman. After a new crime lord starts taking control of Gotham City, Batman must face his own greatest personal failure and its consequences years after the fact. He must also answer some deeply personal questions, specifically why he never kills his enemies, but especially the Joker. The answer he gives is one which anyone who has ever had dark impulses can appreciate. The film also raises questions such as can one ever truly stop crime, or is the best one can hope to do control it? On top of all these interesting ideas, the film has brilliant voice acting and animation, and really creates the appropriate dark and moody feel from the first scene in which Robin is brutally beaten to death by the Joker.

5, This movie shows violence the way it's suppose to.

Note, I'm not a batman fan, but the movie was made like it's suppose to be made, batman is just a human and this movies gets that across unlike the justice league batman that survives everything that should kill him. It's good to see that characters have short comings which adds to their persona.

Based on the graphic novel of the same name, the movie deals with the death and resurrection of a certain former Boy Wonder(Jason Todd) and his mission of vengeance against The Joker and his take no prisoners stance against crime in Gotham city.

Combining the tragedy of the loss of a Robin (Jason Todd) at the hands of a homocidal Joker, the pain of Batman in failing to prevent the murder, the emergence of a major new force in the Gotham underworld, and the unpredictable impact and moral code of nearly-immortal Ra's al Ghul, the surprisingly short feature melds all these elements into a literate, well-crafted and exciting 'whole'.

The voice talents are superb, although, as a long-time Batman fan, I'd have loved hearing Kevin Conroy voice the Caped Crusader, in this production. Neil Patrick Harris makes a very credible adult Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Harris is making quite a career voicing young DC heroes...I loved him as Flash in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-The-New-Frontier-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000PFSYO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, as well!) Jensen Ackles is equally good as the youthful Red Hood, as is Jason Isaacs' portrayal of Ghul. Truthfully, I felt John DiMaggio's Joker lacked the edge of Mark Hamill's interpretation, but I'm partial to Hamill's portrayal, and you can judge for yourself...

The artwork is simply incredible; just pop in a Warner/DC-produced DVD from a few years back, and you will be amazed at how much the definition, line-quality, and overall appearance has improved! This is certainly movie screen-caliber stuff.

I always love Bruce Timm's 'picks' as additional features, from over a decade of animated Batman TV episodes; they touch upon the themes of the feature, offering an earlier 'take', geared to the younger TV demographic. Fascinating stuff! The history of Robin feature is fun, too, if a bit superficial. I wasn't as thrilled by the Jonah Hex short, which didn't fit in with the rest of the material, and clearly served as a plug to the live-action film (which bombed, sorry, guys!)...but overall, the DVD is top-notch.

Great work, DC!",1288915200,,2919,7.284090909090909
4115203,5,B003ES5JDS,"I am big fan of Batman comics and have been following story for a while now. This movie was unlike anything I expected. While other Batman animated movies have been decent, I was expecting this to be similar and nothing more than a rental. However, after watching it, it just made me go WOW.

PROS.

STORY (NO SPOILERS): As you know in DC comics, story has come up to the point that Batman is on his third Robin. This story takes place between Second and Third robin. It is about identity of a masked man that is amazingly almost as skilled as Batman himself. In this journey, Batman will encounter quite a few familiar and not so familiar faces. If you are a follower of Batman, YOU WILL LOVE THE SUSPENSE IN THE STORY.

ANIMATION: No need to speak here. Will make you go WOW as before.

ACTION: Unlike some of the previous batman animated films, it had a great deal of action. Special thing to note was action and choreography were simply spectacular. Batman using his gadgets to save himself from the fall, using hidden C4 on enemies in a manner they don't see coming and action of such matter looked quite natural truly fantastic.

CONS.

The only con. I found in this movie was to save this film from ESRB system, they had very little blood in it. While blood and gore don't make a good movie, but if someone were to be blown by tons of TNT, I would at least expect them to be burned or bleed little. But for some strange reason they don't. Oh well, I am presuming most who are going to watch this movie are gonna be kids. So works for them.

CONCLUSION:

To Batman fans, I would say this is a MUST BUY. But at very least, at least give it a rent. I was quite surprised by the story and animation and I am pretty sure, so will you.",1288310400,,1736,4.25531914893617

4115205,5,B003ES5JDS,"An excellent film for what it is.  Perhaps that's the most important qualifier - this is an animated film designed for adults, mostly Gen X like myself who grew up on the 1990s animated series.  In spite of our matured tastes, we still appreciate their bringing a good solid romp such as this to us in the present day.

In the tradition of ""Superman: Doomsday"" and others, the tone is darker, the themes more adult, the violence more gritty and sometimes disturbing.  The animation is more refined, and certain much-beloved voices while in absentia, are done proud by their replacements.  If you don't think so, compare this ""update"" of the Joker with the one from ""The Batman"" series which many never warmed to.

While I agree that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are an irreplaceable Batman and Joker and that change for change's sake is anathema to any true fan, I will say that these voices seemed a good fit for the animation and storyline.  It just felt more... evolved.  Grown.  I would have been a bit disturbed to see a story like this voiced by such beloved heavy-hitters as Conroy and Hamill.  This is not their time or place, and the movie reflects that.

I will leave the minutia of the tale to others, except to mention that this was a remarkably true-to-form retelling of the comic storyline featuring Jason Todd's resurrection.  Very little was changed, and many of the story points were succinctly included without detracting from the rest.  What adjustments were made served to tighten the storyline and remove potential confusion, and this was well-executed.

One last note: the comic book ending to this story was never given, due to the ""One Year Later"" storyline disrupting all DC events, and I found the one provided here to be true to form and dissatisfying in just the right way that the story needed.

So yes, as I said at the start, an excellent film for what it is.  Just know what you're getting into and if it's your thing, then by all means enjoy the ride.",1287964800,,1984,4.658045977011494

This kind of reminds me of ""Batman the animated series"" of the 90's except with an almost PG 13 rating. Warner Bros. should definately keep the directors, composers, and the same crew if they were to give us a sequel or a prequel to this movie. I'm actually curious to how the the directors would portray Catwoman, Penguin and the other villians in the movie. It left me wanting to see more, which is rare with some direct to dvd movies.

The action is amazing, fast paced, edgy and very well animated and the story itself (including dialogue)is very impressive but make no mistake, the violence, though not gory, is there, it doesn't pull any punches and is a departure from other batman animated movies. I personally enjoyed it since it added to the tension and seriousness of the overall story line. The voice acting was alright. Idk if some of the people chosen to do the voices should have been. Batman, Night Wing and the joker all seemed off, vocally, to me. It didn't take away from the movie but it was noticeable to me. Batman is darker and harder which is a welcome reprieve from the usual mainstream dark and brooding attitude we are used to seeing. Batman's response to the Red Hoods points about dealing with certain super criminals was dark, straight to the point and unexpected and was something, I feel, fans have needed to hear from him for some time. The movie is, without a doubt, an elevation of the Batman on every level. That may sound odd since it is a cartoon movie but this isn't your typical Batman cartoon movie from start to finish.
I gave it 4 stars because I felt some (and I mean very few) of the smaller aspects of the story were predictable but I won't mention them since it comes from a personal PoV and others may not see it that way.

It wasn't just the standard comic book, bad guys good guys, action, and some entertainment, it rose a series of questions with moral and philisophical play that you expect in arthouse/indie flicks.  I don't want to go to much into detail, but the issue of right and wrong, killing and leaving alive, and of course what is allowed in revenge are all addressed, and done in a way that isn't entirely one sided.

4115219,4,B003ES5JDS,"overall. the movie is quite good, despite an annoyingly drawn, and uninspired, ill-performed turn by dimaggio as the joker. he is excellent as bender on futurama but is dreadfully miscast by the usually awesome andrea romano. i did not care too much for the facial features of bruce wayne/batman in this movie although they are not too bothersome. the story is good, the animation fairly solid as usual, and bruce greenwood does a fair job at the batman role, though why you would not get kevin conroy to play the role every time is a mystery. the movie is more violent than the norm here, and the change towards more mature viewers is welcome. the supposedly non-super characters still leap enormous gaps, and fall long distances without harm which i would prefer to see toned down to more realistic levels. this installment of the batman animated series tries to be much truer to the contemporary graphic novels which is the right direction, in my opinion.",1285027200,,958,4.8121212121212125
4115220,4,B003ES5JDS,"Being the first full-length Batman animated movie in a long time that had one consistant story to it(Gotham Knight not withstanding), the latest movie, Under The Red Hood is a retelling of the Under The Hood story arc from the Batman comics. This is a bold new direction for DC Universe by taking a character they've tried selling as being more family-oriented in productions like Batman: Brave And The Bold, and bringing the one that most die-hard comic readers can identify with on the level of The Dark Knight.

The story begins in the past with Joker under the payroll of Ra's Al Ghul keeping Batman and Robin #2(Jason Todd)busy while he tries yet again to take over the world. However, the Joker ""shockingly"" goes way overboard, and kills Robin. Fast forward to five years later where a new masked man called the Red Hood is shaking up things in Gotham City by slowly taking over territory of local crime lord, Black Mask. Batman busts up a delivery of an Amazo robot with the help of Nightwing, but the goons smuggling it are taken out by the Red Hood. Originally, the Red Hood was the alias that the Joker used before he was given his permanent skin bleach. Bats and Nightwing check with Joker in locked in Arkham to see if he's got any connection to this new Red Hood, but even your novice Bat-Fan could tell you the real Joker would've let you know if it was him. The Dynamic-former-Duo track down Hoodie robbing some pushers, but Nightwing hoits his widdle toe, and spends the rest of the movie on the bench. Black Mask sends out the Fearsome Hand Of Four after Red Mask, who are a team of cyber-ninjas original to the movie, but Batman shows up and they fold that deck together. Batman then deduces that R.H. is really Jason Todd, and takes the Batwing over to the other side of the world to have a chat with Ra's Al Ghul. Ra's revealed that he tried making amends for causing Jason to die by dipping him in his time-honored plot device, the Lazarus Pit. Jason came back, but pissed off as Hell, and escaped from Ra's. After hearing this, Batman zooms back to Gotham, to find that Black Mask sprung Joker out of Arkham to kill Red Hood, but Joker doublecrossed him(suprise!), and uses him as bait to lure out his current successor. Red Hood makes off with Joker, and gets Batman to meet him in Crime Alley. Red Hood unmasks to show is indeed Jason Todd. Jason then corners Batman into either choosing between shooting him or Joker, which he stops Jason, and the building they're in blows up. Batman and Joker survive, but Jason's fate remains unknown. The movie ends with Batman reflecting on when Jason first became Robin.

First, I'd like to say how this movie differs from the comics. In the original context, Jason Todd was brought back to life mainly because the evil Superboy-Prime ""punched reality"", and made it so Jason came back to life, although recent retellings of Red Hood's origin also include him backstoking in a Lazarus Pit. There's ben alot of retconning involving Jason's resurrection, but the movie managed to pull it all together well. A few other things like the Black Mask hiring some C-List supervillains from the Secret Society instead of the ""Hand Of Four"" from the original story, although it makes more sense for them to have Batman taking on Mortal Kombat wannabes instead of Captain Nazi, even though they could've had them be the Royal Flush Gang or some other recognizable DC villains. There was also the rewrite of the Death In The Family story where Joker blows up Robin in the middle east, instead of Europe. Plus, no supervillain would ever be stupid or desperate enough to hire the Joker to do anything, and certainly not a criminal mastermind like Ra's Al Ghul! Nightwing was also a little to flippant in this, like freaking out over the Amazo shooting lasers at him, which he should be used to after being with the Titans. Another character who was out of place was Black Mask, who is usually alot more cool and calculating, where here he was way more hotheaded.

As for the movie itself, I think this one has the best animation out of any of the other DC Universe movies, including some of the shorts from Gotham Knight. The city backgrounds look like it might be taking place in the actual downtown New York instead of fictional Gotham City, despite the fact that there are still police blimps in it. The character designs are awesome too, and Joker really looks menacing for once. Speaking of Mr. J, John DiMaggio(aka: ""Bender"")does a bang-up job as Joker by bringing in influences of both Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger. Bruce Greenwood is fair as Bats, but he's no Kevin Conroy. Jason Ackles is good as Jason Todd, and Neil Patrick Harris makes for a decent Nightwing. My only real low grade on the movie is that it should've ended on a more realistic note instead of just some happy flashback with young Jason Todd. The special edition DVD and Blu-Ray versions also feature a killer DC Showcase animated short of Jonah Hex starring Thomas Jane which is waaaay better than that crappy live-action movie, plus a decent documentary on Dick Grayson as Robin. So, in closing, I'd wholeheartedly demand that any Bat-Fan should store this in their cave between the giant penny and robot dinosaur!",1284940800,,5243,4.647629310344827
4115221,5,B003ES5JDS,"Batman has gone through so many different forms in the past, but I'm so happy to see DC finally giving us a dark and brooding Batman.  This movie is amazing and should really be enjoyed on Blu-ray.  Many people think that something animated can't possibly look better on HD, but they are wrong.  Movie takes place with Batman suffering a great loss at the hand of the joker, and having to deal with that loss through the movie.  Nightwing  (the original robin) is in full form and really adds something nice to this show.

For those who figure they'll just rent this...trust me, if your a Batman fan, or just a fan of really good story telling and animation, then you'll be purchasing this movie.",1284854400,,696,4.528

That said the joker didn't work for me. Black mask was annoying. The serious tone and message of this show was lost abit in cheesy hokiness. Something has happened with DC releases past Wonder Woman, GL and PE. Every film is an experiment with big billing actors that don't quite mesh with the super hero they are playing and the scripts while more adult, action packed, and better animated lack the soul of their past counterpart shows. Decent attempt but I really fear there does not seem to be any remote replacements for batman or joker that will do them justice.

The voice acting is top notch, even though Mark Hamil's Joker is the stuff of legend the new voice actor has my applause for his graveled creepiness. It reminded me of Heath Ledgers Joker at times.  A surprising thing is the violence, they pulled no punches with this movie. People get taken out, often and in ways you haven't seen in any animated batman series or movies. I hope the creative team that put this together continues with the franchise. If you like Batman your gonna dig this movie.",1284508800,,797,4.496551724137931

All the characters sounded right, and DiMaggio as the Joker was a welcome change (as much as I like Mark Hamill as Joker, I don't think he would've fit this version of the Joker well.) The main plot point you can see coming, but I was never too sure who 'it' was and I had no idea as to how the other plot points would fall into place.

This whole film feels familiar, but still fresh in how it carries itself. If you're a Batman fan, I'd at least give this a rent.",1284163200,,611,4.008196721311475
4115228,5,B003ES5JDS,"I'm not going to lie to you...while I enjoy watching and collecting all the Batman animated features that I can(especially the DC Universe ones), I haven't really felt every last one I'd purchased was worth the money I paid for it. That being said---I can honestly say I got my money's worth with Batman: Under the Red Hood. This animated feature, to me, is the animated equivalent of The Dark Knight. It's gritty, dark, action-packed and has alot of atmosphere.

The story, itself, deals with the death of Jason Todd(the second Robin) at the hands of The Joker. The Joker, as you find out in the feature, started out his criminal career as The Red Hood, which you find out in flashbacks. Fast Forward sometime to Gotham City, there's a turf war going on between The Black Mask and a new criminal named The Red Hood. The Red Hood, you see, is trying to clean up Gotham by controlling criminal activity on the streets(like The Black Mask) but his methods aren't respectable, to say the least. That comes to the attention of The Batman, who quickly figures out who The Red Hood is and why he is doing things the way that he is. Without giving too much away, let's just say things are rather complex in this tale.

I was especially impressed by the voice talents of Bruce Greenwood, John DiMaggio, Neil Patrick Harris, Jensen Ackles, Jason Isaacs, and Wade Williams. They made this feature quite believable. I disagree with others about Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill's missing their respective roles this time. I don't know if they could've pulled off quite as believable a story.

At any rate, I loved the animated feature and I look forward to Warner Premier and DC's next project.",1284163200,,1679,4.66554054054054
4115229,4,B003ES5JDS,"I recently received this DVD as a birthday gift.  I was a little hesitant, at first, because I was unfamiliar with the voice actors but after watching it, I'm very impressed with this production.  Bruce Greenwood was excellent as Batman and the rest of the cast was also great.

The animation was really amazing.  Some of the scenes of Gotham City looked pretty realistic.  This movie was much darker than any of the Batman movies to date.  I definitely noticed that there was much more violence than what I'm used to seeing in W.B.'s animation.  Most of the really ""bad"" things were done off camera but there was a lot of gunfire, beatings, blood, and killing.  Not to say that those things are not appropriate, because they certainly are, but parents may want to preview this film before allowing younger children to watch it.

Given the storyline of Jason Todd's Robin/Red Hood, the violence is not surprising.  There are appearances by Nightwing, Alfred, Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, the Black Mask, and various other Gotham criminals.

I was disappointed in the special features.  There is a really interesting featurette on Robin/Dick Grayson, which I enjoyed.  There are also two episodes from Batman: TAS featuring Robin.  On the main disc, there is a sneak peak of the upcoming Superman/Batman Apocolypse movie, which looks good.",1283990400,,1334,4.923766816143497

It feels exactly like the comic did and was my favorite Batman animated adventure since ""Return of the Joker"" or ""Mask of the Phantasm.""  Unfortunately, it loses a star because the voices in previous movies, the animated series and especially the ""Arkham Asylum"" video game were so much better than they were here.

An excellent Batman story inspired by ""Death in The Family"", this is the best Batman animated movie since ""Mask of the Phantasm"". The animation in this movie is just flawless that merges some CGI mainly for the batmobile and good old fashioned traditonal 2D animation with excellent voice acting by an talented cast even by Kelly Hu.

I must say that DC animation has done it again!

4115236,5,B003ES5JDS,"Warner Brothers Animation is continuing with its quality direct-to-DVD films that take established comic stories that are fairly true to their origins, albeit abbreviated and somewhat altered.  This latest release sports superb animation, an engaging storyline, and fine voiceover work for a gifted cast.

Bruce Greenwood, though not Kevin Conroy, makes a good Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Those of us who prefer Conroy in the role, can be satisfied with Greenwood's interpretation.

Jensen Ackles, star of ""Supernatural,"" is excellent as the enigmatic Red Hood and Wade Williams fares very well in the role of The Black Mask.  Neil Patrick Harris makes a great Nightwing/Dick Grayson.

However, John Dimaggio is OK as The Joker but the film would benefit the inclusion of Mark Hamill in the part.  His is the definitive voice while Dimaggio comes off a little bit too Heath-Ledger-like.

David Warner should also have been a participant in the film as Ra's Al Ghul.  Jason Isaac's just doesn't have Warner's distinctive menace.  And if 92-year-old Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. hasn't retired, then his should have been the voice of Alfred as in did in the Batman animated series and subsequent movies and television follow-ups.

The PG-13 rating for the film is warranted for the violent content and the occasional profanity; thus, for the parents who may not pay attention to the rating, the DVD should come with a more attention-grabbing disclaimer so that unsuspecting parents won't pop it in, thinking that they'ew getting a more ""family-friendly"" ""SuperFriends"" installment.

""Batman: Under the Red Hood"" is definitely not that.

As far as the extras go, the best of these is ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson,"" a well-produced mini-documentary on the evolution of the character.  The ""Jonah Hex"" short is notable for its inspired casting of Thomas Jane (""The Punisher"" and ""The Mist"") as the deformed bounty hunter and Linda Hamilton as a sinister saloon ma'am.

Animation - Excellent, no complaints at all.

Story - Some will try to compare it to the the comic books, & you just cannot do that. Did this movie do the job of relating the story as best it could: Yes, it did!

Voice Casting - Good & Bad. This always gets to me with these WB productions. For a company that has the excellent voice talent they already have with Kevin Conroy (Batman/Bruce Wayne) & Tim Daly (Superman/Clark Kent) just to name two actors, why do they feel the need to hire anybody else to do the job? With Batman: U.T.R.H., they did a decent job of getting most of the new voice casting right for this production: Bruce Greenwood, & Jensen Ackles voice Batman & Red Hood. Both actors do a great job, Greenwood even sounds like Kevin Conroy's Batman voice, so though he did a great job, why not just use Conroy? Voice failures go to John Di Maggio - the Joker, & (I hate to say it) Neil Patrick Harris - Nightwing. Di Maggio's Joker just is horrible, and he sounds bored reading his lines. Harris' Nightwing is just too goofy sounding. He makes a good Flash, but not Nightwing. Everyone else does a good job with their characters.

No doubt the storyline being based on the comic stories of Jason Todd has something to do with this, but when you watch this animation, you will agree with me that it could seamlessly be translated into a blockbuster live action film.

Combining all of the classic elements of BTAS and the crisp modern production values of today's DC feature films, and adding a spice of realism and maturity that can only rightfully be explored in Batman's realm, ""Under the Red Hood"" is a work of art.

UNDER THE RED HOOD

Batman Under the Red Hood is a new DC Universe animated film based on a few different Batman comics that started with ""A death In the Family"". The story as I am sure you know by now centers around the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin. I will point out from the beginning this is no ""Mask of the Phantasm"" but is by no means a horrible film either. For those of us who read the comics already know basically what the deal is but it was still interesting in seeing how they would fit all that they wanted into an average length film. Did they accomplish what they needed to make this a classic, no, but it is not the worst the company has put out either.

We start off with the Joker and Robin [Jason Todd] spending a wonderful night together all cozy with a crowbar. Well it is actually Joker who is cozy as he is beating young Todd to death and having a great time doing it. Batman is on his way but he does not make it in time as the Joker is gone and Robin is killed by a bomb. Fast forward and time has gone by as Bruce Wayne is still trying to cope with what happened. But it seems he is no longer the big fish in town and neither is Black Mask who's empire is falling to a new crime lord, the Red Hood. The Red Hood has been used by many people including most famously by the Joker, but who is this new guy who can out run and play Batman.

So the race is one as Batman not only has to deal with Black Mask and this new guy named the Red Hood but it seems that the Joker is some how involved. Add in his former partner Night Wing is trying to help out where he can, by the way he was the first Robin but our boy wonder grew up. Now throw in a few more guys and events and you have one rushed and convoluted film, but it is still fun. But to be honest with all that is going on this film seems like it could have been a great miniseries for the DC Universe. But alas it was not meant to be as they crammed as much as they could into this film.

That is over all the main problem with this film, to much in such a short time. Everything else seems fine from the animation to the voice acting. Speaking of voice acting John DiMaggio did an excellent job as the Joker in this film. Everyone else here does a good job as well and all the performances are top notch. Written by Judd Winick and directed by Brandon Vietti this film while heavily mixed with different stories does miss out on a lot that the books had. I could go into all that it missed but that is covered in other reviews but I do recommend reading all the comics.

Also there is an excellent short animated film on Jonah Hex that I highly recommend, I really enjoyed it. It is about a lady, a working lady if you know what I mean, who lures drunk men upstairs only for them never to be seen again. It is just like I said a short film but it is very very good. Also we have a lot of in depth looks at other DC Universe films and two episodes from the excellent Batman animated series from the 90's, 2 about Robin and his origin. As well as an in depth look a Robin in a documentary called ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson"".

This two disc set is very much worth the price and I do think you should get it when you have the chance. Sure this is far from a classic, well maybe not far because it had potential to be the best. But it fell a little short but remains a very entertaining film and 2-disc set, the special features alone are great. So if you are a fan of DC, Batman, The Joker, or just comics in general I say buy it.",1283212800,,3526,3.9591549295774646

I had no idea at how much I would love this movie. This is an extremely well made animated feature. My eyes never left the screen. You can pretty much figure out who the Red Hood is within the first 10 minutes, and later on you find out how ""he was made"" which, in the Batman universe, actually does make sense and will not make you roll your eyes. The animation is very detailed. The voice-acting is spot-on. The Joker is voiced by a different actor now (Bender from Futurama) and though it might take a little of adjusting he does a good job; Mark Hamill is still the best, though. The story, though quick, is a good one. My only, real, complaint is that I wish there would have been a little more back-story of the Red Hood and the reasoning of his exploits. But overall this is a great, great, animated feature to add to the Batman universe. I hope, in the future, there is a continuation of this movie. In my opinion it beats the first 4 batman movies. I have to re-watch ""Mask Of The Phantasm"" to see if I like it better or not, but it definitely beats out the 4 Batman movies, easily.",1283212800,,1253,4.203319502074689

I liked the fact the movie showed depth in each of the main characters.  Also, the appearance of Nightwing was an added bonus.  I always like when the storytellers include a blast from the past.  I am not really a big comic book fan, but I am a huge fan of the animated series.  Batman has been kicking some serios butt for decades now and showed no signs of slowing up in this movie.  The Joker was as psychotic as always.  I loved it.  It was great to see appearances from Amazzo and Black Mask.  The bonus disc did not disappoint.  I loved the Jonah Hex short movie.  Hopefully a full length feature film will be released sometime in the near future.  Excellent movie DC!",1282953600,,845,4.238993710691824
4115249,3,B003ES5JDS,"The aspects of the movie that made it worthy of three stars:
  1. Jensen Ackles did a great job portraying the Red Hood as a vigilante using mobster tactics and Batman's training to control crime while concurrently working toward obtaining vengeance.
  2. Bruce Greenwood lived up to my expectations.  He successfully gave the viewing audience a Batman capable of admitting he should not have made Jason Todd Robin.  Greenwood's voice was a perfect complement to Jensen's Red Hood, John DiMaggio's Joker and Isaacs' Ra's al Ghul.
  3. Jason Isaacs gave me a complete understanding of Ra's al Ghul the character in such a short amount of time.
  4. Kelly Hu's voice-over acting

The aspects of the movie that kept me from giving it four or five stars:
  1. Wade Williams:  While Black Mask is a volatile villain, he is also a cunning crime boss that constantly keeps Batman on his toes.  I felt as if Williams overplayed the part throughout the movie.
  2. John DiMaggio:  He was the best choice for the role of Joker given the script.  However, as a fan of Batman the Animated Series and Justice League, I always wanted to hear Mark Hamill deliver the type of gritty Joker dialogue given to DiMaggio.

I would recommend this movie for fans of Jason Todd or the Red Hood.",1282780800,2,1270,4.660633484162896

The comic books in my opinion are always better than the movies and the cartoon(with the exception of the 60s series which was a pop phenomenon of its own, but this is as good as a cartoon straight to video can get.

4115255,5,B003ES5JDS,"DC Comics I love, however, their past movies (Though I loved Green Latern : First Flight)seemed to lack some things... however.....This movie surpased all.

Marvel can never compete. I'm not sure if DC comics's movies (before this one mind you) were just too scared to add new characters? Well, maybe this will be a sign for them, keep adding! However, the movie was really short, but that's why I guess they added the extra episodes(?), to make it better. (Longer movies are more win, and these aren't going out in theaters, so I don't see why this one was so short)

It was a great story, and they added Nightwing! ('Bout time) However, I was somewhat dissapointed they didn't add Robin (Tim Drake), it could have easily added more conflict for Jason and bought more time, but for what ever reason, they didn't. I'm still very pleased with this movie.

I bought it twice to get the special Red Hood figure my local best buy offered.

4115257,5,B003ES5JDS,"I've been saddened by the inaudible, grunting Batman in the recent movies. You'd need subtitles to follow along with what those guys are saying, and even then it needs interpreting. Batman: Under the Red Hood I rented on a whim, now I have every intention to own it.

The action is fantastic, some of the wildest pursuits and face crunching fights in Batman history. Aside from that it's very well drawn, great visuals on everything from the explosions to the background objects you'd probably not notice at first glance. The story is phenomenal from the start, beginning with a scene that is grueling and following up with loads of surprises with only a few expected occurrences. How it ends is probably the most exciting finish I've seen to date, with hatred and a plethora of other emotions fighting for dominance. On top of that, a certain someone who adds his signature wit throughout the movie brings moments where it's genuinely funny.

The choice of enemies in this one was the most impressive. Not to give too much away but seeing Black Mask play a major role was great. Ra's al Ghul plays an even bigger role, both characters that are rarely given the face time they deserve in Batman flicks. I don't want to reveal any details about the story itself but Red is the real deal. He proves throughout the movie he can go toe to toe with the Bat and hold up better than even the most seasoned villains (again, the pursuits are what really blow me away about this movie, he is not easily shadowed).

Renting this movie is a poor decision. You can buy it with confidence, you won't be disappointed. And if you are one of the handful who don't enjoy this movie, then riddle me this, what Batman have you been watching all these years? Because this is easily the best in years.",1282348800,,1779,4.570532915360501
4115258,5,B003ES5JDS,"I was fully prepared to dislike this movie since my only reason for watching it was Jensen Ackles. Shallow I know but I'm a Supernatural fan and I even watched 'Devour' which was horrible. To be honest I wasn't very optimistic since my last animated Batman was 'Batman-the animated series' and I'm an anime fan, meaning I dislike the animation style of most american productions.

BUT I LOVED IT!
The animation: There were a few car chases which looked too simplistic and too computer clean but the rest was a joy to watch. The fight scenes were impressive, my favorite one was definitely the Red Hood against the four asassins, the character desgin was great and the overall atmosphere was very dark and moody. It's a shame that they didn't go beyond a PG-13 release and did a more bloody, realistic death scene but you definitely get the feeling that they were trying to include as much blood as possible.

The voices: I didn't watch anything besides 'Batman - the animated series' so it didn't bother me that they had different voice actors for this Batman movie. I liked Batman's voice, LOVED the Joker's and the Red Hood's and although he played a very very minor part,I loved Nightwing, he had just the right amount of ligtness and humor to counter the darkness of Batman and the Red Hood.

I liked this movie so much that I finaly dared to watch other DC/WB movies like 'Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths' (Great animation but horrible voices for Batman and Superman), 'Superman/Batman: Public enemies' (great voices but horrible animation) and 'Batman/Superman World's Finest' (great voices and good animation). I have to admit that 'The Red Hood' is my clear favorite since it did a great job with the animation and the voice acting.

So please more Batman movies like this one!",1282262400,,1790,4.764516129032258

4115262,4,B003ES5JDS,"Fitting three major villains and the mysterious namesake character into a 75 minute film is an admirably but perhaps overly ambitious project. Spiderman 3 couldn't pull off a three villain story with two hours.  Luckily the creators - mostly Judd Winnick, adapting his own comic - know what they're doing, and bring together multiple strands of Batman history that adds to, rather than distracts from, the central story.

As a viewer with only a dim knowledge of the Batman comics history, I went into this without any strong opinion about Jason Todd, apparently a favorite target of fanboys, whose death at the hands of the Joker opens the film. Five years later, a vigilante known as the Red Hood makes his presence known in Gotham's underworld, mainly by killing and manipulating its members. The highest-profile of these members is Black Mask, who spends a lot of money trying to get rid of the new presence and who eventually asks for the Joker's help (spoiler: this ends up being a bad move). Batman's attention is necessarily demanded, and he approaches the Red Hood pretty much the same way he would approach any villain. Even with the aid of Nightwing, though, Batman is unable to apprehend him, a failure made eerier by the fact that the Red Hood seems to know an awful lot about the Dark Knight.

Viewers expecting a typical DC Animated Universe outing might be shocked at the level of violence here. The grisly opening scene, while not showing anything more than a bit of blood, is still quite striking relative to the level of violence seen in other Batman animated releases. And this is only the start - lots of gun deaths and (offscreen) immolation and decapitation occur as well. It certainly earns its PG-13 rating, unlike, say, the uncut version of ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker.""

This heightened violence is beneficial to the film for a number of reasons. In terms of character, it allows for a more psychopathic, less clowny version of the Joker. Fans will doubtless be comparing this version to the standard, Mark Hammill voiced DCAU incarnation, to which there is some resemblance. There are some sick laughs to be had in John DiMaggio's wry, sneering delivery, but this Joker is far more interested in death and destruction than theatrics. In terms of story and theme, it allows for the Red Hood character to be a vicious killer while undeniably undercutting the influence of Gotham's scum, bringing Batman's absolute injunction against killing into question on pragmatic and even ethical grounds.

The film's technical aspects are first-rate. Voice acting is solid all around. Bruce Greenwood's Batman is pretty similar to Kevin Conroy, a good thing for most DCAU fans. Jensen Ackles does superbly as the Red Hood, giving the character a range of emotion from callous indifference to impassioned humanity. As mentioned, DiMaggio's Joker is convincingly psychopathic. We could have used more Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing, who provides the bulk of the comic relief. Jason Isaacs delivers his few lines as Ra's Al Ghul with a silky elegance. The fight scenes, of which there are a lot, are inventive and visceral. Save for a couple of confusing gadgets, the action is coherent.

The climax is the source of the film's only problems. A long dialogue about the conflicting morality behind the Red Hood and Batman's actions was inevitable, but it's handled clumsily. Also, the phrase ""Good Lord"" comes up a bit too much, and the two vigilantes reminded me of a couple of born-again Christians trying to hold back swears. This is quite a minor complaint, but it just seemed whitewashed.

Overall this is a very dark and sophisticated film, and a fine addition to the DCAU.",1282089600,,3700,4.919871794871795
4115263,5,B003ES5JDS,"Everybody who's a DC Comics fan knows the stories of the five Robins that have been with Batman.  First was Dick Grayson, who later became Nightwing.  Second was Jason Todd, who was murdered by the Joker.  Third was Tim Drake, who became Red Robin.  Fourth was Stephanie Brown, who is now Batgirl.  And fifth is Damian, the biological son of Batman/Bruce Wayne.  The stories of these five people are unique and a lot of fun to dig into and discuss with fans.  Everybody has a favorite Robin.

Batman:  Under the Red Hood is the story of the second Robin - only after he was killed by the Joker and brought back to life by Ras al-Ghul.  Judd Winick wrote the script, based on the Batman arc he wrote that revived Jason Todd, and it serves pretty well, but I know it couldn't do true justice to the whole story.  There's a lot of history in this tale, and all of it worth telling.

As far as this direct-to-DVD effort goes, the story can't relate all the years Jason was around after Batman caught him stealing the tires off the Batmobile (something that fans simply couldn't imagine being done even back in the early 1980s).  He lasted for five years before getting killed, and was dead for seventeen years before he was brought back to life.

All the fans believed Jason was dead.  After all, didn't DC Comics run a phone contest for fans to decide his fate?  (Right after that, Warner Brothers - the parent company - got hold of DC and asked what they were going to do with the warehouses full of Batman AND Robin products they had to sell!)  So a third Robin was immediately in the offing.

Comic heroes are notorious for not staying dead.  Used to we could point at Captain America's sidekick Bucky Barnes and say, see?  Bucky's dead.  Only now Bucky is the new Captain America and Steve Rogers was dead - except that he's now back alive too.

Simply put, there's a lot of emotional context and resonance and real-time history missing from the pared-down story on this disc.  However, it is slam-bag full of all things Batman.  First of all, there's lots and lots of action.  And there's a ton of Bat-toys.  Then there's the appearance of Nightwing, Ra's al-Ghul, AND the Joker.

There's a lot going on in this movie.  The beginning of the film is gripping, and the assault on Jason Todd/Robin is brutal.  Watching it with my twelve year old was a little hard because I didn't expect that level of intensity.  The Joker was played as perverse and evil, and he stayed that way through the film.  I love how he turned the tables on Blackmask.

The art is rendered beautifully.  Loved the explosive action, the detail, and the cityscape.  The world depicted here really felt like Gotham in all its glory and grime.

I found the ending a little disappointing, though.  Plenty of questions were raised, and everybody got a look at the heroes' moral compasses, but the main question concerning Batman's relationship with Jason Todd wasn't satisfactorily answered.  Batman makes a choice at the end, but where does he stand after he makes it?

I know part of this story is still ongoing in the DC Universe, so the movie is an excellent lure to pull readers into the six-part Red Hood story now being published.  But in these direct-to-DVD adventures, I'd really appreciate a whole story.  This one ends almost where it starts, and we still don't know the true outcome.

This Blu-ray disc comes with lots of extras, including two episodes of the original Batman The Animated Series.  These episodes recount the origin of Dick Grayson/Robin, so they're a special treat.  There's also a lot of material (interviews and comic content) depicting Jason Todd's history.  And there's sneak peek of the next DC Comics direct-to-DVD movie, Superman and Batman:  Apocalypse.  The best part, though, is the Jonah Hex short feature written by Joe R. Lansdale.",1282003200,,3842,4.650297619047619

The storyline was fantastic I thought it flowed flawlessly and a few parts kept me on the edge of my seat. but alas I have grown up with one voice of the Joker and he doesn't sound like a deep voiced thug.

Thankfully the Joker is only in it briefly (I really missed Mark Hamill here), and the rest of the film was really fun to watch.  The Joker was supposed to be a darker portrayal, but the voice just didn't work for me. It was too distracting and took away from the film.  Other than that get this and enjoy the ride.

Then I saw this Batman movie. It is drawn, written and acted much better than past versions.
The movie was not a short movie by any means. It was very entertaining and the flow of the plot kept my attention from start to finish.
Extras on the Bluray are awesome. There is a full Jonah Hex episode, past history videos of both Dick Grayson (1st Robin - Now Nightwing) and Jason Todd (2nd Robin). 4 extra episodes that were hand selected to show some back story and much more.
I have read that the digital copy is very limited what programs can play it. I cannot verify this because I have not used my digital copy yet.

People can complain all they want that Jason Todd (the 2nd Robin) was ""brought back to life"" even though I have to agree, I was glad to see his whiney butt ended in past comics.

4115269,4,B003ES5JDS,"Regarding the field of original animated direct-to-DVD movies, DC is kicking the crapdoodle out of Marvel. BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, running at around 76 minutes, is another well-executed, highly charged superhero thriller, and it's dark and compelling, and never mind that I wasn't that into the Red Hood saga when it was in comics form. This movie improves on the comic book.

Remember about 20 years ago when DC put out an 800 number so that you and I could call in to determine Robin's fate? And the votes came in, and that marked the end of the annoying second Boy Wonder. Since then, Robin's death has been regarded as Batman's greatest failure.

BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD opens in Bosnia and has us reliving that story, with the Joker's savage beating and eventual murder of Jason Todd, with the Batman come too late to save him. Five years later, a new masked man's come to Gotham City, and he's playing both sides of the field, a vigilante vastly more ruthless than the Dark Knight and simultaneously a crime lord craving a slice of that crooked pie. The Red Hood believes he's saving Gotham by taking control of the city's criminal elements. Inexorably he carves out his own territory, digesting chunks of the Black Mask's empire, igniting a gang war. Batman finds himself caught in the middle, and then he begins to harbor a horrifying suspicion as to who's really under the Red Hood.

Unlike in the comic book, there isn't much of a mystery regarding the Red Hood's true identity. Instead of the mystery element, we're enfolded in bits of powerful storytelling. Almost shattering. The strength of the narrative lies in how it keeps resurrecting themes of broken relationships and failed promises and warped vengeance and devastating guilt, and it's like picking and picking at a scab until the blood seeps. In their final showdown, the Red Hood fiercely justifies himself to Batman and, honestly, I think he makes some very valid points. For instance, how many deaths is Batman indirectly responsible for by allowing the Joker to live?

Tim Drake, the third Robin, isn't here, and it's a good move. His presence would've made the story more cluttered. Instead, Batman gets an assist from Nightwing, and it sucks that Nightwing isn't in the movie more. Neil Patrick Harris absolutely does him justice and provides levity to a brooding tale, but then again Dr. Horrible can do no wrong. For a voice cast that's new to DC animation, these actors perform well and emotionally hook you in. I would never have thought of Bruce Greenwood to voice Batman, but he's very effective, although I hesitate to say that he makes Batman his own. I hear too much of Kevin Conroy in his performance. John Dimaggio as Joker takes a bit of getting used to, as well, but it's not bad. His verbals are deeper than Mark Hamill's, and it helps that this Joker is depicted as with more bulk. Jensen Ackles (SUPERNATURAL) makes the Red Hood an almost sympathetic and certainly tragic character. I have to say, I very much see where the Red Hood is coming from.

Pretty good animation, even though Black Mask looks more like the Red Skull. Very good action, an appropriate dose of violence, with the Red Hood giving as good as he gets, although I like that he does get hit, he does get bloodied. Except that he's too stubborn to quit. Batman, of course, is Batman. This film earns its PG-13 rating just by virtue of its disturbing opening scene. The ""payoff"" moments take place off-screen, but you can't prevent those violent images from surfacing in your brain. Joker, deranged and taunting, applying that crowbar to Jason Todd. Even though DC makes the film more accessible by refraining from showing bruises or too much blood on Jason. Still, don't let the younger kids see this. Also, along the way, the Red Hood kills several times.

Now can I please talk about the Jonah Hex animated short? It continues that stamp of excellence that so marked the Spectre animated short featured on the JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS DVD. This gritty short captures the essence of what makes Jonah Hex work as an anti-hero more so than that live action disaster. Thomas Jane voices everyone's favorite scar-faced western bounty hunter, and Jane is loads better than Josh What's-his-face. The story finds Hex meting out his own uncompromising brand of frontier justice to a murderous madam (voiced by Linda Hamilton). And, if you already haven't heard, Warner Brothers is planning to release a DC Showcase DVD featuring four animated shorts: the Spectre short, this Jonah Hex one, the Green Arrow short which will be on the upcoming SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE DVD, and a never before seen short: ""Superman/Shazam! - The Return of Black Adam."" Look for that DVD on November 2010.

Back to BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD. I've got the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and includes a sneak peek (00:12:12 minutes long) at SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE, which features the coming of Superman's cousin, Kara Zor El, a.k.a. Supergirl; the nice Jonah Hex animation short (00:11:53 minutes); and First Looks at JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS (00:11:11 minutes), BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT (00:10:09), SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY (00:02:19); and trailers for THE LORD OF THE RINGS (Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film), the JONAH HEX Motion Comic, and LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS.

Disc 2 presents: a segment titled ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson"" which delves into the roots and evolution of the original Robin the Boy Wonder (00:24:12); and Bruce Timm presents 2 episodes from BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES: ""Robin's Reckoning, Parts 1 & 2.

And the digital copy to boot. Doesn't get better than this. I'd give it four and a half stars if I could, because it was nearly perfect. The action scenes were awesome, and they alluded to so much.

Had the history of Jason Todd been presented in a live action film of some sort, this would have been even better presented as such.  Script was outstanding, and I agree with others the PG-13 rating is warranted.  Before viewing, I was concerned about someone other than Kevin Conroy being the voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but I was very, very wrong.  Bruce Greenwood was perfect and I have to hope he remains the voice in any future endeavors.  Jensen Ackles was great as Jason Todd and clearly evoked the despair and pain Jason had felt the past five years.  I did not like the voice of Neil Patrick Harris as Dick Grayson/Night Wing.  Too youthful sounding. John DiMaggio as the Joker was stable, I got used to him with every spoken word, but just not up to the level of Mark Hamill.  Hamill's higher pitched voice is better suited for a homicidal character with white skin, green hair, a painted smile and purple clothes. The ending was great and Batman displayed the choice he would have made had he had the chance the first time around.  I read all the comics related to this storyline and what was left in, what was taken out, didn't deter one bit.

Of course, no one ever REALLY dies.",1281312000,,1409,4.422480620155039
4115273,5,B003ES5JDS,"Thanks for not dumbing this down, DC.  The storyline closely followed the Red Hood story (stories) from the comics, and the many character appearances were a welcome surprise.  We were treated to many characters within the Batman mythos without having to go through any origin stories (e.g., Nightwing, Ra's al Ghul, Black Mask, Joker).  The only origin story that was presented (Robin II/Jason Todd/Red Hood) was integral to the storyline and shown in flashbacks.  There was also a reference to ""friends"" that were shot (i.e., Batgirl/Barbara Gordon) by the Joker.  I'm glad that DC has gotten over the hump of feeling like they have to introduce characters in their animated films lately.  Instead, they place these characters into intelligent films and focus on the stories themselves, relying mostly on fans' knowledge bases.  After all, who is buying these DVDs?  Probably not anyone who's never picked up a comic book before.

The Jonah Hex short was entertaining as well.  I've never been a big fan of his (or Westerns in general), but I enjoyed watching this particular well-told story.

Next up?  How about using the comedic Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing again in a New Teen Titans animated film.  (""The Judas Contract,"" anyone?  Or actually ANY of the early stories from Marv Wolfman and George Perez.)  Or perhaps a tale including the events from ""A Killing Joke"" and Barbara Gordon's transformation into Oracle and the forming of the superheroine group Birds of Prey?",1281312000,,1482,5.066115702479339

4115278,4,B003ES5JDS,"`Under the Red Hood' has a huge advantage going for it in that it's working from a great storyline with mountains of emotional potential. The plot harkens back to 1988 when the Joker (with the help of thousands of DC fans) killed the then current Boy Wonder, Jason Todd. In the comic Jason was brutally bludgeoned with a crowbar before being killed from an explosion. The film doesn't shy away from extreme violence including a thug who gets immolated on his own Molotov cocktail and I was impressed with how accurately they retained the comic death. One change that did bother me was the redesign of the red hood itself and that I cannot understand. The classic design of the red hood is very distinctive, carries a ton of history and shouldn't have been altered. But c'est la vie, I guess we just have to live with it.

** Possible Spoilers **
I don't know if spilling that the Red Hood IS Jason Todd is considered a spoiler since it's well established in the comics in a storyline that continues to this day and quite frankly Batman figures it out before the halfway point of the movie. The basic premise of the movie is that Jason Todd has returned as the titular Red Hood and has decided to manage crime his own way by becoming the crime boss of Gotham City. This is an interesting concept that that was used by Alan Moore in The League of Extraordinary Gentleman although it's quite a bit less fleshed out here. In fact the only crime Red Hood even commits (besides wanton killing) is extortion from the various criminal heads. He starts a war with the hyper aggressive current crime boss of Gotham City, Black Mask, but the war is only a means to an end and exists just to move the plot forward towards the films Raison d'tre; the bringing together of Jason, Batman and the Joker.

The movie culminates in a spectacular battle between Batman and Jason which is choreographed (or I guess storyboarded) brilliantly. My only complaint is that Batman dishes out enough punishment that in the real world Jason Todd would be dead again five times over. The film climaxes with a powerful speech by Jason on the absurdity of allowing the Joker to continue to live after all the people he's killed (particularly Jason himself). There is one little problem with this scene. Batman is supposed to be right but Jason is the one making all the sense. As a die hard liberal I can unashamedly say that the Joker should be put down like a rabid dog. In the real world Batman's noble views on vigilante killing would be fine because society would take care of the Joker but in Gotham City the justice systems revolving door leaves Batman little choice. The idea is that if Batman kills just once he's started down that slippery slope and there's no going back which makes sense but why not just walk away when Jason offers to do the deed.

The animation is inconsistent ranging from very good to about what you'd get on a television program. Luckily it's good at the important moments and the fights in particular are well done. I don't have a problem with violence and killing but I do take issue when it's gratuitous and the movie definitely skirted the edge of gratuitous if not plunging straight over. My final issue was the fact the there really is no plot resolution in the end and that's a tough one to swallow. I would probably wait for the price to get around $10 for this one because I just think it has a bit of room for improvement.",1281052800,,3434,4.517684887459807
4115279,5,B003ES5JDS,"If you have an interest in viewing or purchasing this movie, you're likely a fan of Batman, DC Superheroes, or both.  Either way, this blu-ray disc will not disappoint.

Batman: Under the Red Hood is an amazing disc featuring a superb video and audio presentation of one of the best films released to home video by DC to date, and it comes loaded with special features. The following is my take on this release.

THE MOVIE (A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW):

This movie is an adaptation of the comic book story that debuted in Batman comics nearly five years ago. Those familiar with the comic who watch this film will notice some changes to the story (this story omits the Infinite Crisis tie-in device featured in the comics, allowing the film to work as a stand-alone piece). Although I'm a fan of the comic, I personally found the film to be superior to the original comic storyline in every way.

The film opens with Batman attempting to avert an international threat involving two of his deadliest foes, and the opening sequence ends with Batman suffering the worst tragedy of his crime fighting career. After the opening credits roll, the story jumps ahead about five years. The setting is Gotham City, and a mysterious figure calling himself Red Hood is waging war against Gotham's reigning crime lord: Black Mask. Black Mask is noted to be the first criminal in Gotham to take over the crime/drug trade completely.  It is no small feat then when Red Hood cripples Black Mask's operations, taking over Black Mask's territories and eliminating anyone who gets in his way. Red Hood's actions eventually place him in Batman's sights, and the resulting chases and battles between the two prove to be some of the most impressive ever depicted on film, animated or otherwise.

The chase scenes through Gotham city rooftops incorporate extensive aerial acrobatics, lightning fast martial arts techniques, death defying use of grappling lines, and bullseye gunslinging by Red Hood. Also keep your eyes open for a very impressive scene where Batman and one of his closest allies employ perfect team work to prevent a falling aircraft from crashing on city streets. I've never seen anything like it before, and I was very impressed.  Of course, the film culminates in a showdown between Batman and Red Hood, but between the opening and closing of the film, you'll be treated to one breakneck action sequence after another. Each of those scenes highlight different aspects of Batman's crime fighting skills and his advanced crime fighting technology. You will be treated to extensive shots of the Batcave, and you'll see appearances by the Batmobile and the Batwing. Special mention goes to one of the earliest action scenes where Batman is first reunited with one of his oldest allies.  The two employ perfect teamwork in a breathtaking action sequence where they take on and defeat a very powerful enemy. The battle takes them from the ground to the sky in an amazing display of aerial combat, death defying acrobatics, and life-saving grappling gun skills, culminating in Batman's stealthy and perfectly timed use of his utility belt arsenal to defeat the villain.

While the film's story is pretty straightforward (mostly serving as the thread tying together the awesome action scenes), the plot is solid, featuring a few interesting twists along the way. These plot turns reveal how cunning and ruthless the Red Hood is, as well as how the Red Hood is connected to Batman's past. Red Hood is a worthy adversary for Batman, and his strategies lead Batman into a situation where the only way out may be to cross a line he has vowed to never cross.

Being that this is an animated film, the performances rise and fall on the strength of the dialogue and the talent of the voice actors. In that respect, neither of the two disappoint. The dialogue sounds mostly natural for a story of this nature, and the voice acting is very strong. While long time fans of Bruce Timm's Animated Batman consider Kevin Conroy to be the definitive Batman voice (myself included), Bruce Greenwood (Captain Pike from JJ Abrams' Star Trek) does an impressive job as the Dark Knight Detective. His style is different from Conroy's, a bit softer and more gravelly, but a fitting voice for Batman. Greenwood is joined by Jensen Ackles (best known as Dean Winchester from Supernatural) who does excellent voice work as the Red Hood, Neil Patrick Harris as a good humored but highly skilled ally of Batman, John DiMaggio (Bender from Futurama) and Jason Isaacs as two of Batman's oldest foes, Wade Williams as a frothing and violent Black Mask, and, Kelly Hu as the trusted assistant of Black Mask.

As for the animation, the style is similar to Bruce Timm's previous animated work, but with a smoother, more realistic look to the characters. The animation quality runs somewhere between the more recent Bruce Timm Justice League animated series and a really great anime. This isn't quite Disney caliber animation (which features generous frames of animation per second that give the appearance of life-like fluidity of movement), but for direct to video, it is truly great work. I'd say it's on par with good Japanese Anime such as Naruto.

All in all, I was so impressed with this film that after it ended, I watched it once more just to digest the awesome action scenes. I've let the movie run while doing other things, but I always stop what I'm doing to admire the action scenes; they're more inventive and impressive than anything I've ever seen.

Conclusion: this film is very highly recommended.

Now for the BLU-RAY REVIEW:

PICTURE QUALITY: Picture quality is a flawless 1080P. Although most of the scenes in this film take place at night or in otherwise dark settings (the movie is about Batman, after all), the image never falters. Characters are animated with amazing clarity, while backgrounds pop with near three-dimensionality. Colors are sharp and vibrant without bleeding, as evidenced by night time scenes involving explosions and electrical/energy weapons. There is also no artifacting or aliasing that I could see. Perfect video here.

AUDIO QUALITY: Audio is very crisp and balanced. Flying batarangs, gunfire, explosions, dialogue and everything in between comes across solidly and clearly. I did not have to constantly adjust the volume up and down to hear dialogue and to avoid overly loud jumps in volume levels when gunfire and explosions rolled around.

SPECIAL FEATURES (SPOILER ALERT: TWO OF THE FEATURETTES MAY BE SPOILERS TO THE PLOT OF THE FILM, SO BE FOREWARNED)

ANIMATED SHORT FILM: The best special feature is a short film starring Jonah Hex (he is a gunslinging cowboy character set in the wild west time period of the DC Universe; his most notable physical characteristic being horrific burns/scars on one side of his face). Thomas Jane does great voice work as Hex, and his fine effort is complemented by that of other well known actors, including Michelle Trachtenberg, Linda Hamilton, Jason Marsden and Michael Rooker. This short ten minute film sees Hex tracking a a wanted criminal to a saloon/hotel where some of the clients check in and don't check out. When Hex comes up against the murdering criminals who run the joint, you'll see him employe fast thinking and even faster shooting to stay alive. The ending sees the villains getting what they deserve, and I for one, was very pleased with the film. I've seen a review saying this film was in standard def, but it looked hi-def to me, so you will have to decide for yourself when you see it.

FEATURETTES: The first one features Dick Grayson, the first Robin; the second features the second Robin, Jason Todd; the third is called ""Robin's Requiem"" - a feature about the comic story from the late 1980s called ""A Death In the Family"" which involves a death in Batman's family; and the fourth is a sneak peek at the upcoming Batman/Superman Animated Movie featuring Supergirl's reintroduction to the DC Universe called ""Apocalypse.""  These features are in hi-def.

FURTHER BONUS FEATURES: Included on this blu-ray disc are four original episodes of the Bruce Timm Batman Animated Series hand picked by creator Bruce Timm.  The episodes are: ""Robin's Reckoning"" Parts 1 & 2 (featuring the origin of Robin as told in the Batman Animated Series); ""The Laughing Fish"" (Joker is the main villain, with his scheme being to use his chemical gas to create fish that share his Joker's smile - the story is actually more entertaining than it sounds, plus Joker is voiced by the definitive Joker voice actor, Mark Hamill); and ""Mad Love"" (a Joker story featuring Harley Quinn, Joker's main squeeze, who hopes to get rid of Batman permanently so that she can be the focus of Joker's attention). These episodes are in standard def.

DIGITAL COPY:

You also get a free digital copy of Batman: Under the Red Hood. But don't get too excited. It is exclusive to Windows Media Player, so all you itunes/ipod/iphone users out there are out of luck.

FINAL WORD:

If you are a fan of Superherores, Batman or the Bruce Timm animated DC Universe, you owe it to yourself to either buy or rent a copy today. The film is by far the best direct to home video feature ever produced to date.  With great voice acting, solid animation and a story that is equally dark and exciting, fans of Batman and superheroes in general will not be disappointed.

4115282,5,B003ES5JDS,"Let's see; A healthy dose of a murderous madman;  The discovery of a former partners `return from the dead; A dark hero struggling to justify the path he chose after losing his parents.........this is one whale of a Dark Knight Tale brought to us by the animating team at DC comics!
  Of all the Batman stories Bruce Timm, Inc. could have brought to DVD, `Under the Red Hood' represents a full arc of intrigue, action and emotion which makes DC characters so unique in the world of comics.
  The animators and writers seemingly jumped into a Lazarus pit of opportunity to take you into the madness and pain of Jason Todd - the Robin stripped from Batman's side by the Joker's hand. One also gains a better perspective of Dick Grayson's respect for his former mentor, while we better understand why Batman's code of ethics is so resolute.
  All this emotional story telling is teamed with action and violence befitting a story based in Gotham City. The PG-13 rating is a good measure, but that said, the violence depicted was far from gratuitous and merely served as a means of better understanding the characters in the story.
  ........Simply an amazing story - ""Under the Red Hood"" stands tall, arguably taller than any other animated DVD Warner. Bros. have released.  However September has the promise of another great DVD as Michael Turner and Jeph Loeb's Supergirl story arc will be brought to animation; looking forward to it!",1280880000,,1432,4.784552845528455
4115283,4,B003ES5JDS,"Batman: Under the Red Hood encompasses the Judd Winick (who also wrote the screenplay in what may be his best work to date) story line of the same name as well as the classic 1988 Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo yarn ""A Death in the Family."" Synopsis and plot summaries of the movie are readily available all over, so you hardly need me repeating it.

While not a perfect film by any stretch of the animation, Under the Red Hood is dark, fun and, more than anything else, able to walk the line between giving fanboys what they want while never insulting the intelligence of an average, non-initiated viewer. At no point does the film hold your hand or spend much time on exposition, something the other DCU Animated films seem to have a problem with. Winick's script is tight, clever, and really understands the core of each character. The animation looks tight, for the most part, with the notable exception being any and all of the 3D vehicle models, which look clunky and lifeless. I understand the reasoning behind using these models, but more than anything else (including the voice actors), they take me out of the moment.

And now the big one: voice casting.  I was incredibly skeptical going into this film, in large part due to the fact that Batman and the Joker were no longer voiced by fan favorites Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (who has stated that Arkham Asylum 2 will be his final performance as the character) but two other well known actors: Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio. Greenwood does a fine job as Batman, mostly because he's doing his best Kevin Conroy impression. Obviously there are some differences in the voice, but overall he does a fine job. John DiMaggio, however, takes a lot of risks and decides to completely change up that loveable rascal, the Joker. Knowing Mark Hamill's trademark high pitched, whimsical voice and cackle wouldn't cut it, DiMaggio goes for a stark alternative: a deeper, much more vicious and cruel version of the Joker whose laughter is less grating and irritating (as it should be), but much more sinister.  DiMaggio's history in animated comedy shows as many of Joker's lines are timed perfectly, and there's never a moment where the viewer ever feels comfortable around him, regardless of the restraints he may be in. DiMaggio's take is a welcome breathe of fresh air for the character. If WB was smart, they would keep these two on speed dial in the future. Supernatural star Jensen Ackles voices Jason Todd and doing a fine job out of it, as do most of the cast. Fanboy favorite Neil Patrick Harris feels a bit underused. On camera, his charm and wit are unmistakable, but here, they fall flat. It also hurts that Nightwing is in, maybe, 20 minutes of the movie and really feels like an afterthought.

A solid score mixed with ok extras (though the FANTASTIC Jonah Hex short had me smiling ear to ear at completion) really makes me think that DC's animated film department really stepped up their game for this one. Again, while not perfect, it's a huge step forward for the line, especially with All-Star Superman up next on the plate.  After this, though, I really wouldn't mind more original Batman movies. Recent storylines like Batman RIP come to mind, as do classics like Arkham Asylum and the Killing Joke, but we'll have to see. Check this out if you're a fan or you just want to be entertained for 75 minutes.",1280880000,,3373,4.679595278246206
4115284,3,B003ES5JDS,"It's really borderline whether or not to even be able to recommend this movie.  It feels more like a documentary than a story.

More than any other DC comic movie or show, this one consists largely of repetitive dialogue along with lots of running and jumping.  That would be fine if there was a strong story the back it up, but this, as I said, was more like a documentary....a chance to observe Batman as he deals with probably the most emotionally charged period of his life.  For somebody unfamiliar with the comic series that spawned this movie, it was interesting, but that's about it.

Mask Of The Phantasm was a much better Batman movie.  And if you're looking for some good super hero animation with original and entertaining storylines, a much better bet is the Justice League Unlimited series.",1280880000,,804,4.707142857142857

4115287,5,B003ES5JDS,"This is without a doubt my favorite animated movie put out by DC and probably Marvel too.  Being a Marvel fan it was hard to say that but it is true.  Having read the original ""Red Hood"" story I can say that I did enjoy the comic but not as much as the movie. (isn't that usually the opposite?)  I really enjoyed the emotion behind ""the Batman family"" and speaking of, Neal Patrick Harris was truly inspired as Nightwing.  But I can't go on without mentioning Bruce Greenwood and his perfect portrayal of Batman.  Before this i would have said that Kevin Conroy (Batman in the Animated Series) was the one and only voice for Batman but I think that Bruce really is Batman.

The moral dilemmas raised in this show are fascinating to watch and then contemplate after the film is over.  I often times find myself questioning who I should root for.  The animation is crisp and visually striking which is awesome as this movie has some pretty intense action sequences that are sure to thrill the mind.

All in all I wish Marvel could turn out animation of this caliber.",1280793600,,1064,4.471502590673575
4115288,5,B003ES5JDS,"As a long time comic fan who has been disappointed with many animated movies based on books or comics I was wary about purchasing Batman: Under the Red Hood for that reason but chose to take a chance.

Like many other reviews I can say that I'm pleased that I did. For such a short run time, it manage to include much of the material that was included in the 2 graphic novels of the same title. It was filled with action, some nicely timed humor that reflects better on screen that it did in a book. A couple scenes weren't there that I would have liked to have seen but overall this movie did stay true to form and didn't disappoint.

The voice acting was also very well done though as another reviewer mentioned I would have liked to have had Conroy and Hamil do Batman and the Joker but Bruce Greenwood did an excellent job with Batman and Jensen Ackles couldn't have been more perfect as Jason Todd a.k.a. the Red Hood.

4115292,5,B003ES5JDS,"Batman: Under the Red Hood is the latest in the DC Universe series of animated DVDs.  The two-disc DVD is very special and tells a gripping story and gives lots of great features that you'd spend hours watching.

The main event has to do with Jason Todd, the second Robin who was beaten to death with a crowbar by the Joker and then bombed out of existence -- or so we thought.  Batman began his darkness at this time, blaming himself for Todd's death.

I though it interesting that the writers only touched on Jason Todd as Robin, not really getting deep into the history of the character -- just enough to interest the viewer but not so much as to bore me to death with details only a rabid fan would know.

Still, the foam began forming around my gums as Batman hunts the Red Hood.  The Red Hood was also the name of The Joker back in the day (in the comics world, in the 1940s) and so he hunts up the Joker (with some special humor appeal from Nightwing) to see what Joker knows about this Red Hood character.

The underworld is under his pay, 40% of all they bring to the drug trade to the Red Hood and he will provide protection.  This vigilante can't stop crime, he says, so he'll join them -- and kill anyone who gets in his way.

Great fight scenes, some ingenious moves and some flash-back stories to a younger, more vibrant Jason Todd.  The story reminded me in many ways of the Hush storyline in its action and keeping the viewer guessing as to the Red Hood's identity.

Features:

Lots of backstory on the Robin character, from Dick Grayson's beginnings, his development into Nightwing and the early writers and artist's reasons for giving the lone Batman a sidekick in the first place.

Two Batman-related videos from the early 1990s, where Robin finds the killers of his parents and Batman tries to prevent him from taking revenge.  Tight story, not a slow minute.

The previews and trailers, I've seen most of them already:  Crisis on Two Earths and so on.  However, the first look into Superman/Batman Apocalypse with Darkseid as the powerful bad guy and a complete Supergirl origin story was right out of the Supergirl comics done by Michael Turner a few years ago.  But the story is expanded and the creators of the show really exude interest and excitement for this project.

Lastly, some Jonah Hex animated stories.  The animation is not as top notch as the feature film, but does make for some interesting storytelling.  Jonah is looking for a man who is on his bounty list.  Except the man was murdered by a madam who kills first and kisses later.

Bottom Line:

The story and voice-acting abilities of Batman: Under the Hood create a dark, interesting view of a Batman who seems to have created a monster, full of anguish and what he can do to rectify the Red Hood and his crime spree -- regardless of how many criminals he has to walk through to stop him.

A must-see for any Batman fan and a great intro to the DC Animated Universe of DVDs.

4115293,4,B003ES5JDS,"Great story line.  the only drawback I had  with the movie Is that I am a huge Joker fan and the actor they chose didn't do as great of a job as Mark Hamill dose, this actor did very well, however at times I felt his portrayal of the joker wasn't as deranged as it should have been i felt the joker should have enjoyed the beginning scene much much more than he did the beginning scene should have shown the joker having some serious fun but Ihe just seemed less sick to me. the joker just didn't seemed sick enough at times. although the final scene with the joker was very good and made up for some of the scenes i was disappointed in. I don't know why they chose a different cast, I suppose to differentiate this story line from the animated series and other films with that cast, but I enjoyed the film its awesome. I would have enjoyed it more if mark Hamill was in it. I would recommend it to any fan (way better than Gotham knight) If your a batman fan you will definitely enjoy this movie its worth getting.",1280620800,,1015,4.173469387755102
4115294,5,B003ES5JDS,"Reading the reviews others have given, I would have to say that I agree with most of them.  Under the Red Hood is an EXCELLENT addition to the DC animated library, no question!  However, something I was VERY pleased with that doesn't seem to be getting a lot of attention is the Jonah Hex Showcase short that is included on the disk.  I'm a fan of the western and wierd western genre, so Jonah is right up my alley.  Thomas Jane provides the voice for Jonah, and I have to tell you, he really does an excellent job.  With any luck they will do a full length Jonah Hex animated movie, and Mr. Jane will reprise his role (hint hint, you folks that make this all happen!).",1280620800,,669,4.2362204724409445
4115295,3,B003ES5JDS,"I agree with most reviewers that this movie is not for kids.  This is mainly due to the violence.  In this movie characters actually get shot and die.  Plus there is a pretty violent beating scene for a cartoon.

Plot:  The overall plot was good, nothing special though.  There were no twists or mystery and everything was pretty predictable

Characters:  All the characters were done well and so was the dialogue.  My only complaint is the Joker.  Mark Hammil is NOT the voice of the Joker in this movie.  This is a shame.  I believe the directors were trying to make this joker more like the one in the ""Dark Knight"" movie.  This doesn't relay well in an animated feature.  Plus if you bought this movie, its probably because you are a fan of the animated series.  Not having the original character voice is a disappointment.",1280620800,,827,4.568493150684931
4115296,2,B003ES5JDS,"Once again, I was duped by the ""digital copy"" offer.  For $19.99, I was supposedly getting the blu-ray and the digital copy, which theoretically would have allowed me to play the movie on my iPad and iPhone, as well as AppleTV.  Well, again, this studio has decided to make the digital copy Windows only and ""not compatible with iTunes or Macintosh.""  The studios can do whatever they want, even if they want to cut out a large swath of the public for no obvious reason.  But my problem, when purchasing on Amazon, is that this is NEVER EVER clearly indicated.  Since, I've been duped before, I've learned to look for this.  But NO WHERE (and the digital copy is no longer offered) on here did it say PC only. This is the CLEAR EXCEPTION to the digital copy norm and I make it a habit to encourage studios who offer digital copies with Blu-Rays by buying them (when reasonably priced). I would not have purchased this movie had I known that.  A simple ""PC-Only Digital Copy"" tag would have sufficed...

What's worse, I actually have Windows 7 running in Parallels on my MacBook.  So I gave this download a try in Windows.  After being forced to install some bizarre download manager, I was shown two files downloading: PC and PSP.  To make a long and annoying story short, there only appears to be one file and it WON'T PLAY on Windows Media Player -something about an incompatible codec (ay yay yay!).  The file is only about 3MB, so I assume it's the PSP file.  The ""PC"" file is no where to be found and the download code no longer works.  So now, I don't even have this digital copy in PC.  All that pain for nothing (and this isn't a Mac vs. PC issue - I often use both). The only reason I give this product two stars is because it actually is a good movie.  But I didn't get the value I paid for.  Again, this is why there is piracy.  Studios are punishing people who are actually willing to pay for digital media...",1280620800,3,1921,4.363380281690141
4115297,3,B003ES5JDS,"The movie itself would get 10 stars, don't get me wrong!

This review is specifically for the two disc special edition ONLY!

The Jonah Hex short is amazing, but I've heard DC is soon releasing all the shorts in a collection with a brand new Captain Marvel one. If Jonah isn't on the single disc for Red Hood, wait until the Showcase collection.

The Dick Grayson as Robin documentary was what made me buy the two disc edition. The documentary wasn't good at all. It does not cover the character of Robin or Nightwing in depth, does not cover the character's appearances in other media (from the 1940s serials to the cartoons of the 1960s through Batman Brave & Bold...not even Batman TAS!).

The two Robin episodes are nice (Robin's Reckoning Parts 1 & 2), but if you have the complete series of Batman TAS you don't need them.

The Robin documentary mostly covers the psychology of the sidekick, and the psychology of comparing Batman to Robin and how they deal with parental loss differently.

I'm telling you, as a fan of DC Documentaries as special features this is a dud. The 18 minute long Supergirl documentary in the Smallville Season 7 boxset was more comprehensive! The 14 minute Plastic Man history with the 1980s animated series DVD set was even more comprehensive! Seriously, Robin deserved a better documentary, not even his time with the Teen Titans in the comics was mentioned!

I don't recommend buying the two disc set if you were only doing so for that Robin documentary!",1280534400,16,1491,4.711538461538462
4115298,5,B003ES5JDS,I hope DC/Warner keeps up the story and production team creating the stories like this. Was amazed at how well done the story was. Animation was also nicely done along with the story and soundtrack to the movie. This movie follows the batman animated series. Hope this may be a start to bring back the batman animated series.  Keep it up DC/Warner this new direction does work. The next release Superman/Batman: Apocalypse also looks good. They have a good behind the scenes feature on the single and 2 disc edition.,1280534400,,516,4.733333333333333
4115299,3,B003ES5JDS,"Although I grew up on Robin (Dick Grayson) in the cartoons, Jason was the current Boy Wonder when I was buying comics. So I dugged the idea of a Jason Todd as Robin/Red Hood movie and hoped that his Robin years would finally be appreciated.  He got dissed when the ""fans"" voted him out and seem to favor Dick Grayson and Tim Drake as Robin. There's even a Dick Grayson featurette on the Special Edition. His Robin isn't even the star. Jason's Robin featurette is only available on the Blu-ray, which sucks big time. Like it or not, Batman has three ""sons"" (not counting Terry McGinnis), and it's time Jason gets his proper respect. This movie truly wasn't what I had hoped, but had a few okay parts. I wanted a less gory version of the Death in the Family storyline from the comics, they complied. But all the changes weren't cool. More Jason as Robin first would've been great, especially for folks unfamiliar with the storyline. I did like how bad ass Jason (Red Hood) was when battling Batman and Nightwing. But why was his Robin costume primarily red (like Tim's)in the flashbacks? Didn't Jason ware the same yellow cape, green shorts, original Robin costume that Dick wore, with minor if any changes? Tim originated the black cape, long red pants Robin costume. ONE IMPORTANT THING. The reason whey dvds aren't selling well anymore is because companies aren't packing them with nearly as much bonus content as before, and releasing 2-Disc editions with so limited an amount of content that it should be compiled onto one disc. DC/Warner's animated releases typically include the main feature (60-75 mins. long) on Disc 1 with preview or two as a bonus. HELLO, A PREVIEW IS NOT A BONUS. Disc 2 has one short documentary, a brief animated short, and two episodes from Batman or Justice League box sets that most of us already have. So it's a major rip-off. When they finaly stop putting out 2-Disc editions with only one disc worth of content and provide more actual bonus content altogether, then maybe more people will start buying instead of renting for a buck though Netflix or Redbox.",1280534400,5,2092,4.715846994535519

4115301,5,B003ES5JDS,"Still mourning the loss of Robin ""Jason, not Dick Grayson"" at the hands of the Joker (voiced by John DiMaggio), Batman finds himself up against a new enemy that calls himself the Red Hood (Jensen Ackles). The Red Hood cleans up Gotham as well but unlike Batman, killing is an option.

  While trying to stop the Red Hood, Batman finds himself up against Ra's Al Ghul (Jason Isaacs), The Joker and Black Mask. Batman gets help from Nightwing (Neil Patrick Harris) but he rather work alone since he blames himself for the death of Jason.

  Batman: Under the Red Hood is easily the best Batman animated film...ever! It has plenty of intrigue, action and it's also surprisingly very violent. The film is crowded with villains, even a Riddler cameo, yet the movie isn't a mess like Spider-Man 3. All of the villains fit into the plot extremely well. I didn't expect the movie to be so well made that dare I say, it's almost as good as the Dark Knight. I strongly recommend this movie!

I was floored how well they made this animated movie, not scared to show how low it can get to entertain its audience. More animated movies should take notes from this excellent creation. I just hope the movies quit shying away from characters not considered as being ""Dark and gloomy"" as Batman.. Just make them dark if that's their issue! As long as you stay true to the character making them dark won't be a problem. I'm sick of just seeing Batman getting all the screen time when their are other characters such as Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl who some of us can look forward too!

By the way I can see Jensen Ackles being perfect as the Red Hood or an older version of Jason Todd as Robin in the movies, throwing you pennies for your attention WB & CO..

4115303,5,B003ES5JDS,"As a long time fan of the Batman mythos, the story of the second Robin has been one that's lingered with me for ages.  ""Under The Red Hood"" does a fantastic job at exploring Jason's death and his rebirth.  The movie is beautifully animated, the acting is superb, and the tone is gritty, dark, and haunting - exactly what I'd hope for in a story such as this.

I love that there is very little true good and true evil.  It's very easy to see shades of the three members of the Bat family in each other - elements of Dick's lighthearted attitude return in dark reprise in Red Hood's lines, just as likewise we can see hints of Red Hood's ruthlessness in his former mentor.  And the complexity isn't just with our heros:  Jason Issacs as Ra's al Ghul is a delightfully conflicted character despite being nominally on the villain side of the house, and the political interweaving between Red Hood, the Joker, and Black Mask is honestly fun to watch.

If there is anything I'd have wished for more of in this story, it would be an exploration of the connection between Nightwing and Red Hood.  I'd have liked to see more about the similarities in differences between these two sons, both of whom left home for very different reasons - and returned in equally different means.  Sadly, Nightwing is phased out relatively early in the story which is a real shame for a fan like me who enjoys the relationship between Nightwing and Batman - and Nightwing's running commentary on Batman's methods - just as much as that between Batman and Red Hood.  The movie feels like it runs a bit short to me, so there could easily have been some extra time spent in this area.  The movie also suffers from a lack of Tim Drake, which is equally unfortunate but perhaps understandable in the interest of simplicity.

All in all, ""Under The Red Hood"" is an action packed romp with some truly delightful twists and turns.  It's grim and dark, but there's a delicate thread of hope and humor running throughout it.  It's a definite must for anyone who enjoys the Batman mythos or even just fans of solid animation and action stories in general.  As I'm a fall of all three, it's a perfect win for me.",1280534400,,2174,4.4961832061068705

4115305,5,B003ES5JDS,"From the no holds barred opening scene dissolving to the classy cinematic credits and film score, this was the biggest surprise and the best of all the direct to dvd Warners/DC animated movies to date and packs a major wallop right to the final breathtakingly animated, heart wrenching scenes. Reminiscent of the dark themes, intensity and emotion of the uncensored version of Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker, no coincidence that the unrelentlessly evil and twisted psychopath Joker does very bad things to another Robin in this one too.
As they say, you are only as good as your script and this movie gets the balance just right between emotionally charged character motivation to give reason for all the vigilante anger and violence, so the explosive, action packed set pieces doesn't just become 'noise'. We actually give a damn about the characters. For an animated film as opposed to live action, this is more difficult to achieve but that's how good 'Batman: Under The Red Hood' is.
Voice acting all round (perfectly cast by Andrea Romano) is pitch perfect with perhaps the exception of Neil Patrick Harris as 'Nightwing' whose tone is more lightweight/cartoonish but then again, his character in this movie is the least angry out of all the characters.
What Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' did for raising the bar of live action superhero movies to the next level (how dark and adult can they go?), this movie raises the bar in quality of superhero animated movies. This movie is not suitable for children but made for a wider, more adult audience. Producer Bruce Timm and his team must be relishing the creative freedom that this direct to dvd format gives them (easing censorship restrictions that Television can impose), to be able to have such dark themes in animation get to the final cut.
If 'Superman/Batman: Apocalypse', released 28th September can match the quality and intensity of this one, then Warners Animation will continue to set the benchmark standard that other animation studios will try to emulate.",1280534400,,2035,4.988235294117647
4115306,4,B003ES5JDS,"okay, the short review is as follows:
>> action, story, dialogue is great. die hard batman fans = buy, pedestrians = rent. *not for young children*

and now the long review:
>> first off, i'm reviewing this as modern age batman fan. i grew up on the animated series [and yes, batman DOES have the best rogues gallery]. i feel that as complex as batman's characters are, once you understand them, their interactions between one another become very clear. that being said, Batman: Under the Red Hood definitely delivers. the re-introduction of Jason Todd into DCU proper was nothing short of inspired and they did a fantastic job translating Jason's story into an animated short.
>> the script was great because it told a simple, fluid 'revenge story' that really didn't leave any plot holes. i like that the creative team pulled from different source materials to make a DARK, gritty, action packed movie. the dialogue between the characters was spot on and delivered with precision. all of the voice actors were great but i was very impressed with Jensen Ackles voicing Jason Todd. for a character that's never before given a literal voice, Ackles conveyed JT's emotion and purpose brilliantly.
>> as for the extras on the dvd, it's always nice to have subtitles. there are a few trailers for previous dcu animated movies, as well as trailers for 'the Lord of the Rings, animated', 'Jonah Hex Motion Comic' and 'Legend of the Guardians'. the best extra is the 'First Look at Superman/Batman Apocalypse', the next dcu animated movie [it tells the story of Supergirl's return to the DCU proper].
>> all in all it was a great movie. i didn't give it a 5/5 because there will always be room to improve, 99% of the time. in my personal opinion, it would have been more compelling to swap out Nightwing for the third Robin, Tim Drake..or hey, include all three Robins; but it would've probably gone over the 75 minute mark. i wish there was a commentary track but there isn't one. and yes, there are a few other things that i could nitpick at but it's really just that, nitpicking. the DVD is great and my only regret in purchasing it, is not having purchased the two-disc special instead. good job DC!",1280448000,,2196,4.703896103896104
4115307,2,B003ES5JDS,"Batman: Under The Hood, written by Judd Winick, reincarnates former Robin, Jason Todd, as a homicidal vigilante. Though the permise was gimmicky from it's conception, (an obvious ploy commisioned by DC to get people to buy into their ultra-convoluted ""crisis on infinite earths"" story arc) Winick wrote a sharp witted story-arc with humor and some psychological depth. This was all lost in the dismal animated adaptation. Batman: Under The Red Hood undermines pretty much everything Winick did in the comic book counterpart. Jason is sorely underdeveloped; All we know about him is he was a cocky kid who once wore green tights as Batman's former side-kick. His years spent with Batman are simply set-up in quick excerpts. Jason's bitterness is aparent but it's superficial at best. I think the film's secound biggest crime was the absence of good humor. Judd Winick is primarily a cartoonist so funny dialogue isn't foriegn to him and the witty banter he wrote for Black Mask and Todd was entirely eliminated for the animated film. As a matter of fact, the only reason why I read this story more than once was mostly because of the humorous dialogue. One of my favorite lines was the following:

Joker (talking to Jason): Didn't I kill you ?
Jason: You said that already.
Joker: I know, I just like to keep saying it.

In general, the humor fell flat in this film. Many of the one-liners felt like poor TV sit-com garbage, mostly coming from the painfully flat Nightwing. Last the plot was just done so poorly. Most of this film is just fighting, the initimate moments of the original comic book story-arc were brushed aside such as Todd taunting Joker because he knows he isn't as crazy as he thought he was and dimissing Black Mask (who looks like a low-rent pimp in this movie) as just another thug with a gimmick. The biggest plot hole had to be Jason's plan to free the Joker from Arkham Asylum. How would Jason know Black Mask would recruit the Joker to stop him ? In the comic it made sense, Jason found the Joker and just kidnapped him. Why even place him Arkham at the time ?

I think I could probably go into another long and seperate rant about the flacid backgrounds and character designs and futility of being ""reaslitic"" in animation. However I'll just say that DC is better off making story-arcs like this into live-action films. You don't have to go on the scale of features but something DTV so you won't have to cut so much out in an animated adaptation. Lastly Warners can afford a stable of talented voice actors that are a lot cheaper then boring live action stars. Spare us all and get the casting right for these films.",1280448000,8,2643,4.655246252676659

This movie is GREAT the animation is SUPERB. The Voice casting (which I thought would never live up to the animated series) truly surprised me. The characters were right on...I like the Joker in this version, seems a lot more DARK,TWISTED, AND INSANE. If you like the DC Animation I HIGHLY encourage you to get this. PARENTS BEWARE THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOUNG VIEWERS. Just in the first 30 seconds of opening you see some pretty brutal stuff. The extras were ok not a lot but ok I guess. The JONAH HEX SHORT THOUGH...This is another reason why this movie should be a must buy. Hopefully DC will come out with Hex's own animated movie.",1280448000,,788,4.5174825174825175
4115309,3,B003ES5JDS,"I was shocked that the creators didn't hold back and showed the Joker beating Robin to death in the first scenes. ....other similar scenes make this DVD absolutely not for kids.

Cons: I was a bit disappointed in that unlike the movie ""Superman/Batman, Public Enemies"" that followed the story arc faithfully, used Conroy's voice, and based the artwork on artist's Ed McGuinness this story didn't.  I was looking forward to how they were to interpret the artist's Doug Mahnke's work and show some of my favorite's scenes from the trade. One scene from the book was Batman's quest for understanding how people come back to life after death from his friends, Zatanna, Superman, and Green Arrow .... classic Batman interaction. At one and 15 minutes long...they could have added some of these classic moments.

Pro: Pretend you never read Batmam, Under the Red Hood and this is a great movie. Brings all the pieces together of Jason's death and his comeback as the Red Hood.  The last scenes where Batman remembers the first day of Jason as Robin is heart-breaking.
The action scenes, the battle scenes, and the chase scenes are fantastic. They took a page from Batman, Gotham Knight DVD and brought Gotham to life..the lighting ...the shadows of the city, all enhance the story.",1280448000,2,1275,4.888888888888889
4115310,4,B003ES5JDS,"Probably having just as much knowledge about the Batman mythos as any average Joe out there, I am glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed ""Batman: Under the Red Hood.""

The story itself is just as the advertisements have been talking about, everything revolving around just who exactly is this new person called the Red Hood. With Batman having taken down a good number of criminals and having already gone through two Robins in the process, it seems as if times are finally changing for the caped crusader. Having initially ruled over villains through fear, there still remain those who aren't intimidated by Batman and continue on their rampage around Gotham City. With this problem at hand, the Red Hood has taken it upon himself to clean up the crime Batman has left behind, not even fearing killing those who get in his way.

As short as the running time for the movie is, the pacing is actually perfect with nothing feeling either too fast or too slow. Gaps in the story are explained with the help of flashbacks and don't remove from the experience at all during the movie and appearances from villains the Joker and Black Mask only add to the enjoyment of the film. Conclusion: Definitely not your typical B-rate direct to DVD movie.

Special Features are standard for DC, with two documentaries covering the history of the first and second people to have played as Robin in the Batman mythos. Also tacked on (at least for the Blu-Ray version of the release) are two episodes from ""The Batman"" animated series, covering the backstory of the first Robin and two episodes from the original ""Batman: The Animated Series"" revolving around the Joker. While the Robin episodes make sense as an addition to this release, the two Joker ones seem more like they were added on last second in that they don't connect all that well to the film itself and are merely alright in terms of episode quality (the first, covering Harley's backstory is a fan favorite, but the second concerning the Joker and some fish was rather dull).

For those who picked up the Target exclusive, the only additional content is a second disc, which contains the special features already on the first disc as well as two more episodes from the animated series I've yet to watch. I'd say if I had to choose again, I would have gladly gotten the amazon.com exclusive with the lithograph over a filler bonus disc any day.

All in all, a great movie that was only slightly hindered with its filler special features.",1280448000,,2483,4.711981566820277

4115313,5,B003ES5JDS,"One thing that can be said about Batman is that his character as a whole has created a monster fan base. Part of that fan base that grew up with the Dark Knight has actually had the privilege to create some of his most memorable adventures. Bruce Timms' newest animated movie `Batman: Under The Red Hood' is one of the more recent Batman classics brought to us. What makes this story so special is that it was derived from one of the darkest stories in Batman's legacy, and that story revolved around the death of the second Robin. Historically the death of Jason Todd is known as `Batman's greatest failure'. What Under The Red Hood does is takes `A Death In The Family' and adds a whole new chapter. Deriving from the major elements it turns `Death' into a much larger story with an incredible epilogue. As much as I would have loved to s `A Death In The Family' brought to life, `Under The Red Hood' may in fact be the best Batman story the DCAU has offered us.

The story that this film gives us takes place five years after the death of Jason Todd. Suddenly the crime lords of Gotham City have a new threat and he is this merciless vigilante known as Red Hood. His mission is to keep the mob in line and make sure that while their actions continue to flourish, they have to work under his rules. Because, if they step out of line, they die. Of course Batman leaps into action to try and take him down, but once he gets too close to this new threat his world will be shattered when he discovers who Red Hood truly is.

This movie was such an incredible piece. It is definitely the darkest film up until this point, but it is such a well executed story. There are however a few negatives, but I will go with the positives first. What I loved about this film was the homage to the ending of `A Death In The Family'. While it is not as graphic as depicted on the pages of the comic, keep in mind that this film is rated PG-13. Still, they kept the actions taken and the dialogue intact and it is such a gripping scene to watch. That feeling that you get in that moment carries on all the way to the end of the film. The final showdown with Batman & Red Hood is incredible. I have never seen such passion and emotion thrown into one of these films up until now and I have to say that I had to re-watch that whole final scene, just because it was so well done. On that note the voice acting was perfect. Bruce Greenwood did a spot on job as Batman. I have to admit, there were points in the film where I couldn't even tell it was him because he sounded so similar to Kevin Conroy. What made Greenwood a better choice for this film was the passion in his voice especially when he raised his voice. Jensen Ackles was great as Red Hood. He started out just as a regular voice actor, but the scenes he has with Batman are so great. The final showdown he puts almost an Oscar worthy performance, I have to say I was enthralled. John DiMaggio took on the Joker. Now, I have to say that many people always hate when Mark Hammil isn't there, but let's face it with a movie as heavy as this one Mark Hammil's voice would just come of extremely cartoonish. Don't get me wrong in Phantasm and Return of the Joker he does a great job, but take a look at those movies in general and compare them to the setting of Red Hood. I promise you, you will understand why they used another actor. Still DiMaggio as a plus turns on that Mark Hammil Joker charm in this film, but the voice he brings is a darker, creepier Joker and it's a win for this film. The best voice would have to be Wade Williams as Black Mask. He brings sheer over the top villainy to Black Mask. It is one of those voices that just makes the character so evil you grin with delight at his madness. Black Mask was this guy that would get so high strung in two seconds he would punch through a brick wall.

So, what are the faults of `Under The Red Hood?' It was too short. A movie of such grandeur should be more than 79 minutes. I don't know why Bruce Timm thinks that we have such short attention spans. There were so many great things thrown into this package that I felt there wasn't enough. An example would Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing. I could watch NPH perform in front of a brick wall for 3 hours and be entertained. He breathed great life into his character, but it would have been great just to see more action with him in it. The flashbacks of Jason Todd were great as well. I thought maybe it would have been a plus to throw some flashbacks of Dick Grayson as Robin maybe to see him depart from Batman or encounter him for the first time as Nightwing. Yet, I digress.

`Under the Red Hood' is a great film, mostly because it revolves around the Robin character. Robin is a persona in DC comics that is always blasted by fans because of the camp of the silver age and the old Adam West show. Still, Robin is probably one of the most important characters because he brings a human side out in Batman. To see what Batman goes through when a hero that he trained becomes something he shouldn't be it just makes the Batman persona more of a legend, but more than that a hero with a heart.  Also if you are planning to get this film on DVD, purchase the two disc edition, which features another DC Showcase short. This one features Jonah Hex, and since his movie bombed this will be all the Jonah Hex you need.",1280448000,,5371,4.210679611650486

Even the music and sound effects were good. My only gripe would be that the directors pushed the envelope of reality a little too far at times; some scenes left me scratching my head in disbelief. Aside from that, the plot unfolds nicely and the movie kept me engaged the entire time. If you're a fan of the recent JL movies then you'll probably enjoy this too.",1280361600,,636,4.352941176470588
4115315,5,B003ES5JDS,"Batman: Under the Red Hood is by far the best animated movie that DC or Marvel has put out in years. I'd go as far as to say that it's the best animated movie that's been made. All other animated movies that have come out recently were always lack luster or you were never completely satisfied. With ""Under the Red Hood"", You definitely got your money's worth. The voice acting (And you've got to give it up to Andrea Romano for once again putting together an excellent cast) was superb. Big ups to Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood. Probably did the best job of the cast. Not to take away from any of the other voice actors who did fine jobs themselves. Notably John Dimaggio as the Joker who I thought made the Joker his own with his portrayal. Bruce Greenwood as the Batman was also dead on. Neil Patrick Harris did a pretty good job as Nightwing though he slipped up with the voice once or twice and seemed to use his regular speaking voice. He didn't have a very large role in the feature so it wasn't anything that took away from the movie. Wade Williams also did the Black Mask justice. His character was written a little over the top but Williams captured it very well. I think the fact Judd Winnick (the original writer of Under the Hood) writing the feature is definitely what made it as good as it was. He stayed very true to his original story but the changes he made to the original story still worked out very well. Not only did he take the 2 volumes that comprised the ""Under the Hood"" arc and combine them for the movie, he was also able to connect the events of ""A Death in the Family"" (Possible *SPOILER*) which is where Jason Todd meets his ultimate demise at the hands of the Joker. End of the day, Batman: Under the Red Hood was an excellent movie that you shouldn't miss. It does not disappoint.",1280361600,,1813,4.319648093841642
4115316,5,B003ES5JDS,"I never read the original comic story so I don't know how it went... but this movie was freakin' awesome! Charaters seem spot on as well... A Batman obsessed with his mission, a Nightwing that remembers he moved on b/c he was tired of batman's crap and a joker that's just crazy as hell. I love how DC has started making their movies darker and less dependent on the 90's animated series. The movie starts with Joker beating robin with a tire iron, later kills another crime bosses 8 guards like it's nothing, and later has the joker pouring gasoline over a rival crime boss trying to set them ablaze to get the attention of the title characters... That's how I like my joker, bat-snot crazy with a smile. Another scene a gangster is about to light up a rival mobster with a molotov cocktail and the red hood shoots the bottle setting the would be killer ablaze.

The voice actors did a great job. The story was awesome, dark, and seriously action packed. And they packed more characters in than I was expecting to see. DC has been slowly stepping up their game lately ever since Marvel merged with Disney.

*People need to stop reviewing this movie poorly because they didn't use the original voice actors. Hamill has not voiced Joker (except in the game Arkham Asylum) since like 2003... deal with it.
*People also need to stop reviewing this movie lower because the FREE digital copy they got doesn't work with their Macs. Boo-Hoo, you didn't pay for it so there's not a reason for it to effect your review.

4115320,4,B003ES5JDS,"This review originally appeared on [...].

I'll admit that when Warner Bros. announced Batman: Under the Red Hood  as their eighth direct-to-DVD feature, I was a little disappointed. The story of how Jason Todd returned from the dead seemed a bit too convoluted and complicated for a seventy minute movie, and there were easily a dozen other comic storylines I'd like to have seen adapted for film first. After the brilliant Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Warner had a lot to live up to with their next title, no matter what it was. Though Under the Red Hood doesn't quite live up to the high standard of Crisis on Two Earths, it's actually pretty enjoyable, and is one of the more action-packed animated movies DC and Warner have released.

Way back in the glory days of 1988, fans voted for the Joker to kill Jason Todd, the then current Robin, by calling into a 900 number DC created to give readers a say in what happened during the monumental ""A Death in the Family"" storyline. Batman was of course devastated, and since that day has had a Robin suit hanging in the Batcave in memoriam. In 2005, Todd was resurrected by time shockwaves created as the result of Superboy-Prime punching the walls of his inter-dimensional home. Jason returned to Gotham a changed man, obsessed with finding out how Batman could possibly have let the Joker live after what he did. Taking up the moniker of one of Batman's first villains, the Red Hood, who would later go on to become the Joker, Todd brought a war to Gotham in the hopes of drawing out the Joker so he could finally finish him off for good. Even though that's just the extremely short version, it's still a bit... complicated. Trying to condense years of continuity into just over an hour could have resulted in one messy movie. Surprisingly, Winick does a great job adapting his own comic script into a film that though a bit heavy on continuity, is easy to follow.

The first step in making Under the Red Hood`s story more accessible to the general non-comic reading public is ditching the whole Superboy-Prime time punch angle, and instead opting for a more traditional (at least in the Batman universe) resurrection courtesy of Ra's Al Ghul's Lazarus pit. You see, the Joker still kills Jason Todd, though the violence is awkwardly toned. Joker mercilessly beats Todd with a crowbar, yet there's nothing wrong with his face save a few scratches. I'm not asking for gallons of blood pouring from gashes across the boy's face, but this strange double-standard the DC animated features have with portraying violence continues here to odd effect. It actually takes you out of the moment for a second, but you're reeled back in the moment a bomb goes off, blowing the building up, and leaving Todd dead and buried in the smoldering ruins. Flash forward a few years, and suddenly a new Red Hood is popping up in Gotham, challenging current big crime boss Black Mask for territory. None too happy with gang violence of any kind, Batman teams with Nightwing to investigate this new Red Hood. As the mystery deepens, Batman's findings lead him down a path that leads to only one answer: the Red Hood is Jason Todd. The final act brings the Joker, Batman, and Todd together again in an appropriately intense conflict, and it does a great job bringing everything that has happened full circle.

The characters are brought to life wonderfully by one of the best ensemble casts Andrea Romano has ever put together. Bruce Greenwood's Batman is intense and driven, but he's also introspective and mournful. Greenwood's able to bring the father figure in Batman out with ease, and though we don't get to see much of Bruce Wayne in this movie, Greenwood's able to present the duality of the character very well. Jensen Ackles does solid work as Jason Todd. It's got to be tough trying to emote when your character spends 90% of the film behind a full face mask, but Ackles somehow finds a way to get all of Todd's rage, passion, and regret through to the viewer. I'd love to spend more time talking about Neil Patrick Harris' Nightwing, but he's in and out of the movie so fast, you don't ever get a chance to enjoy him. That said, he steals every second of the brief amount of screen time he's given. Jason Issac's Ra's Al Ghul is appropriately regal, but as good as everyone else is, John DiMaggio really brings it. I love Mark Hamill's Joker. For the rest of time, his will be the voice that I hear when I'm reading the Joker's dialogue in a comic book. In this film though, DiMaggio is able to make the Joker his own, and he's darker and more twisted than ever before in an animated story. You really believe that DiMaggio's Joker would kill, which was always a trait missing from other voice actors. Even Hamill at his psychotic best never made me believe for one second the Joker was going to kill someone, and that's a testament to both DiMaggio's performance and Romano's direction.

What really stands out in this picture though, are the incredible action sequences. Since Todd was trained by Batman, he's got virtually the same skill set, which makes for some pretty intense fights that feel like they belong in a Bourne movie. And that's a good thing. Too often, Batman's enemies are either untrained crazed thugs or madmen more focused on killing then they are technique. When going up against one another, Red Hood and Batman are almost equally matched, and by the third counter attack, you've really lost track of who's actually winning the fight. The animation in these sequences is spot on, never moving too fast for you to see what's happening, while at the same time showcasing rapid-fire moves that would make real fight choreographers jealous. None of the characters in this movie actually have any real superpowers, and it's refreshing to see an honest approach to hand-to-hand combat rather than the ""I punch you really hard, you punch me really hard"" combat theory that so many more powerful heroes subscribe to.

Now, like Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Under the Red Hood also comes with a ""DC Showcase,"" this time for Jonah Hex. Try not to think about the live-action movie that was in and out of movie theaters in the blink of an eye. This short manages to be faithful to the core of the character, well-acted, and expertly animated. Tom Jane stars as Jonah, who rides into town looking for a man with a bounty on his head. It appears something unpleasant may have happened to this outlaw before Hex captured him, but Hex always gets his man. A few quick action sequences and one eye for an eye later, it's all over. The only thing wrong with the short is, well, it's too short. Just like the Spectre's story on the previous DVD, I was left wanting more immediately. Now that the ""DC Showcase"" is going to be a regular part of the package, I look forward to them almost as much as the feature.

Even though I still think Crisis on Two Earths is the current front-runner for best direct-to-DVD DC Comics feature by Warner Bros., Under the Red Hood is still highly watchable. The creative team does a great job adapting the comic storyline, and the action, intensity, and acting will have you enthralled until the very end. Combined with another solid effort in the Jonah Hex-starring short, this is a package that's hard to resist. I just hope Superman/Batman: Apocalypse can live up to the new standard set by these last two films.",1280275200,,7410,4.6727969348659
4115321,5,B003ES5JDS,"If you don't like anime and hated ""The Batman Vs. Dracula,"" then this is the first pure Dark Knight cartoon since 2003's Mystery of the Batwoman. And I am pleased to say, this is the greatest Batman animated feature since Mask of the Phantasm.

The mysterious new Red Hood rolls into Gotham and tries to control the Gotham gangs with Batman and Nightwing caught in the middle. Bruce Greenwood, Jensen Ackles, John DiMaggio, and Neil Patric Harris do a superb job in their roles. Special mention should go to Neil Patric Harris who does an absolutely perfect performance as Nightwing. On the other hand, John DiMaggio provides a different voice for the Joker than we all are used to, deeper and a bit reserved, compared to the loony, cackling Joker that Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger used. Despite this, the Joker really steals whatever scene he's in.

This is all because it's written and plotted so perfectly. There's plenty of action that will keep you glued to the screen, but there's also a great conflict in this story that is a hallmark of all great Batman lore. Not just the Joker, but Batman, Nightwing, and the Red Hood are written true to themselves that any fan of the comic book will instantly recognize them. If you're not a fan of the comic book. that won't affect your enjoyment of this movie. It's been perfectly adapted from the source material, so that all the problems have been ironed out.

I should say, though, Robin III (Tim Drake) isn't in this movie at all.

They really covered their bases with the Extras on this Blue-ray. Two documentaries ""Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson"" and ""Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd"" really fill in the blanks for the average fan that doesn't know the history of Batman, Nightwing, and Robin.

Also included on the Blu-ray, four episodes from Batman the Animated Series: ""Robin's Reckoning, Parts 1 & 2,"" - which details the origin of Robin, ""Mad Love"" - where the Joker meets Harley Quinn, and ""The Laughing Fish,"" when the Joker tries to copyright a face on a fish. These four are really great parallels to the movie, besides being phenomenal all by themselves.

Plus, a First Look at Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, which can only be better than the last one. We hope.

And of course, the 11-Minute Jonah Hex cartoon. It has good animation, but what really stands out to me is the excellent music direction.

Some trailers pad out the rest of the disk.

But if you only get the Two-Disk edition, you don't get the ""Jason Todd Documentary"" or ""Mad Love"" or ""The Laughing Fish.""

If you have a Blu-ray Player, don't hesitate to get the blu-ray edition. You don't want to miss all that good stuff. Great adaptation. Great acting. Superb animation. Awesome extras. A five-out-of-five. For Batfans, and people who love cartoons. What's the greatest Batman cartoon movie? It's either this or Mask of the Phantasm, and if you already own Mask, get this already.

The only thing missing are the commentaries. This is Blu-ray. Stop giving me trailers, and cram in some commentaries.",1280275200,,3037,4.754752851711027
4115322,5,B003ES5JDS,"I have always liked Bat Man cartoons, especially after Warned Brothers took up the franchise in the early 90's and presented a more serious, moodier Bat Man.
This movie is a great addition to anyone's collection because it presents a very interesting side of Batman that we don't usually see: a weak side that feels regret or maybe even guilt. And very well done with excellent voice acting and a great animation style.

The only warning I have here is for parents: It carries a PG-13 rating due to the violence level. I would caution parents to not show this to young audiences at all. I usually let my 8-year old son watch DC cartoons with me (his favorite is Justice League), but under no circumstance would I let him see this one with me. Examples of what happens that I don't consider appropriate for kids are: beating to death using a crowbar, sniper shots to the head to other characters, massive beatings with weapons, murder with improvised weapons and hand guns. In fact, I think this is THE most violent Batman cartoon I have seen.",1280275200,,1042,4.602150537634409
4115323,5,B003ES5JDS,"So I finally got myself a PS3 and have moved into the world of Blu-ray...sort of. I still need a nice HD TV, but that's coming. So this won't be a review of how the Blu-ray quality of the picture held up, though even on the screen I watched it on it was absolutely beautiful. My friend just kept repeating ""the animation is sick!"" So yeah even without the TV it was gorgeous. Oh and the sound was great too, my other friend that was there was stunned right away by the clarity of sound. So that was cool too. And now that I've gotten that out of the way on to what you really came here to find out, was it any good?

The answer is a resounding HELLYEAH!!!! I have been a fan of all of the DC Animated films, and this is by far the best in my opinion. Though they started off a little wobbly they have matured into some truly fun and well done films. I still say they should be at least 15 minutes longer each but they have started to make up for that a little with the DC Showcase shorts, but more on that in a bit.

First Some quick background for the uninformed aka non-geeks. Everyone knows who Batman is. Most know who Robin is as well. A lot may not know however that there have been several Robins, three that are well known and loved or hated as it were. Dick Grayson was the first Robin, and grew into his own heroic mantle as Nightwing (recently taking on the mantle of the bat himself), while Jason Todd was the second Robin who was headstrong and less loved. Then there was Tim Drake, the third and arguably the best Robin, as he took the title from being just a sidekick to being his own solo hero, as well as following in Dick's footsteps and leading the Teen Titans.  Still with me? Good. Now in 1988 Jason Todd had become unloved by fans to the point where DC allowed fans to vote on the fate of Todd at the end of the ""A Death in The Family"" story arc. Fans voted him dead. And that's exactly where this movie starts, with the death of Jason Todd at the hands (or crowbar and bomb) of the Joker. Judd Winnick who wrote the ""Under The Hood"" arc that this film is based on struck gold with this. He not only faithfully adapted the story but improved it by streamlining it of all the crazy subplots and the ""Crisis"" event tie-in. And what a story it is!!! It's gripping, emotional, and action packed. I mean seriously ACTION PACKED! There's barely a lull in the film before you're off to the next chase or fight. The choreography for the fights is amazing too. But it's the story that propels these insane action scenes and it just keeps getting better as the film progresses.

Five years after the death of Robin, there's a new vigilante taking on the criminal element in Gotham called the Red Hood. He's using the name of the Joker's first criminal identity and taking on all the crime lords in the city especially Black Mask, and he isn't afraid to shed a little, or a lot of blood. This naturally catches Batman's attention, and the chase is on. I really don't want to say too much more about the plot as if you're not a comic person, the person under the hood as it were is still a mystery, though not much of one due to obvious clues but still, it's a mystery all the same.

The animation is slick and very well done. The Batman model looks like an updated version of the one seen in DC's last release ""Justice League: Crisis on two Earths,"" and is well detailed as are all the other characters. Kudos to DC for finally using Nightwing's comic uniform instead of the silly bird insignia they have been using (though the ""Teen Titans"" and ""The Batman"" versions were cool), and for crafting a Joker who truly looks sinister. And we can't talk about an animated flick without mentioning the voice cast. Wow! That's all I have to say. First of all Bruce Greenwood voicing Batman was rather good. I am one of the few that have been okay with most of the iterations of the character as I though each voice fit with that version of the character, but for this dark and brooding story and world, I felt that Greenwood captured it perfectly. Kevin Conroy who has voiced Bats for almost 20 years in animation is the iconic voice, and he would've been great, but Greenwood did an exceptional job. Neil Patrick Harris was spot on as Nightwing, he got his chatty personality but his detective upbringing down very well. Wade Williams was interesting as Black Mask. The character first appeared in animated form on ""The Batman"" voiced by James Remar and was cold, and calculating, never really losing his cool. This version is very cold when calm, but violently over the top when he's angered and I liked it. But the voice I loved most was John Dimagio as The Joker. You know DiMagio as Bender from ""Futurama,"" and here he's absolutely fantastic. A bit more deep voiced and gravely than I was used to, his humor is dry and he's constantly cracking himself up. But that dry delivery is amplified by the psychotic and sadistic things he says. Just wait til you see the final confrontation between Batman, Joker, and Red Hood.

This movie was amazing, but the total package is made better by the DC Showcase short ""Jonah Hex."" Thomas Jane (who wanted to play the part in the live-action film) voices Hex and he is awesome. Just like the last Showcase short ""The Spectre,"" Hex completely embodies the genre it attempts to capture. It is 100% a western in the vein of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and other Eastwood classics. From the setting to the music it has a true western feel, and none of the cheesiness that was in the live-action film. This is what the film should have been. Rounding out the voice cast are Michael Rooker, Linda Hamilton and Michelle Trachtenberg. Other special features included are two documentaries about the two Robins featured in the film, Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. There's a first look at the upcoming ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" based on the ""Supergirl From Krypton"" arc, some trailers, and of course Bruce Timm's picks from past cartoon series, this time all from ""Batman: The Animated series,"" with a personal favorite of mine being ""Robin's Reckoning"" telling Dick Grayson's origin. Don't look for any updated picture quality with these though. They're just as they are on the DVD.
All in all a good buy for anyone who is a fan of Batman or of just good action.",1280275200,,6299,4.435233160621761

4115325,5,B003ES5JDS,"When I first subscribed to DC Comics 5 years ago, this storyline was already underway. Though knowing the backstory of Jason Todd's death and Joker's identity as the original Red Hood, I was still very confused. I didn't really attach to the story and even now, I don't really get modern comics, my tastes lying back in the Golden and Silver Age (even some tales of the '70s), so when I heard that this was the next film the DCU line, I was a little disappointed. But now that I've seen it, I now consider it my second favorite animated Batman movie.

The first few minutes detail the pivotal events that occurred in the ""Death in the Family"" storyline of the late '80s. I'll admit I thought the scenes with Joker thrashing Robin with the crowbar would be a lot more brutal, but I was nonetheless shocked with the end result. When I mentioned last time that less is more (heck I even had a discussion about that topic with a customer where I work, which I found eerie), it proves that we don't need to see the Joker strike him every time. Once was enough and after that, most of it was done in shadow or off-screen, which is really all the audience needs to know that this kid is being tortured to within an inch of his life. When the movie flashes forward and Batman has recollections about the times he and Todd worked together, it shows that he was similar to Dick Grayson in his youth but as Jason grew into his teens, he attempted to take the law into his own hands. Batman's reacts with sorrow and regret as he faces his past, and it was a nice touch when was talking about how he'd like nothing better to kill Joker but knows that he could never return from that path.

The animation was crisp and the characters looked great, though on the cover of the DVD and on the menus, the characters reflect how they appeared in the comics but in the actual film, they didn't really have any resemblance. New Frontier and Public Enemies, while being adapted to Bruce Timm's style, still had a passing resemblance to how they appeared in those books. Black Mask however, didn't look as intimidating. Even in The Batman, he looked more of a threat (I don't think they added pupils in that version).

This voice cast is one of the best they've pulled off so far. Since Batman first appeared in New Frontier, we've gone through four different actors, and, Conroy aside, each has been able to make the role their own for that particular movie. Bruce Greenwood is no acception, bringing the pain and anguish that Batman is feeling as he sees his former partner alive really shows in his performance. Jensen Ackles makes Red Hood psychotic but during the scene when he and Batman fight off the guys with the ""lightsabers"" (were they in the comic?), he has Jason feel nostalgic about the adventures they had before. Neil Patrick Harris brought some levity as Nightwing to an otherwise dark film and it was welcome. None of his sarcastic remarks didn't come off as forced or inappropriate. As for the villains; though Mark Hamill will always remain my favorite, John DiMaggio was funny and lethal as the Joker, one of my favorite scenes being when he and Black Mask are in the prison cell. Though I felt out of place (I was watching this with my family) when I started laughing with all the dead guys lying around. I'm a very morbid person. Jason Isaacs was great as Ra's al Ghul and I almost wish (the key word being almost) that he had done the voice for Batman: TAS. Though he and Batman are enemies, he had no intention of Robin dying and he revived Robin with, I think anyway, good intentions (though even he should've realized that the Lazarus Pit would drive Jason crazy). Wade Williams, while good as Black Mask, seemed over the top. With all the yelling and screaming, I had very hard time of thinking of him as a threat. Again, the interpretation seen in The Batman was done very well, an unknown person with a very large organization, who had a deep gravelly voice supported the mystery behind that skull.

The Jonah Hex short I wasn't too crazy about. All power to those who do like the character though, this is just my opinion but outside of his appearances in Batman and JLU, he didn't come off to me as an impressive character. Also judging by the live action film that was just released, it didn't look all that impressive, for the Wild West, there sure were a lot of explosions (and it had Megan Fox, which also probably didn't help it). It did have some good points though, the animation was great and the voice cast was good.",1280188800,4,4534,4.478839177750907

When I first started the movie I wondered who the Red Hood would be. Especially after The Joker appeared as The Red Hood in Batman Brave and Bold series. It starts off with the Joker having a new look killing second Robin Jason Todd then jumping five years to a Gotham that has the police patrol blimps we use to see in Batman The Animated series.  While I'm not sure if I prefer The Black Mask in this animated incarnation or that one from the previous THE BATMAN series better I find find this movie to have no dead spots. It just move from one action filled scheme like Batman and Nightwing taking on Amazo the android or The Red Hood giving the other drug lords little join but to follow his orders or else.

It's Batman's world:  dark, raw, and violent.  The only way it should be presented.  The animation, storyline, and voice actors were spot on.  And while I am partial to Tim Conroy as Batman, Bruce Greenwood does Gotham's favorite son justice.  Even Doogie Howser kicks butt as Nightwing.

With that said the animation itself is not impressive. I enjoy 2D animation, however, it seems with these direct to dvd animated movies the animation has not progressed. Anything that moves is brighter than the backgrounds which takes away from the visual aspect of the story. Its been an element of animation that I never liked. When other animated movies, that are geared towards adults or even children, have progressed the DC and Marvel animated films seem to stay the same. The perspective on the figures seem to be off, there's no weight to the action; its as if everyone in a fight defies gravity, and the detail of the characters are simple. I was never a fan of the Batman: TAS. I thought the block style animation was terrible and there was no fluidity to the motion of the characters. This is the case with some of the animation in this film. Some of the half hour cartoons today have better animation than these films. Dark and grittieness comes off as cheesy with simple animation. The opening credits sequence has more mood and tone than the rest of the film. The Batman Gotham Knights sticks out animation wise and its mostly done by japanimation artists. Save your money and rent these movies. If you like it, then purchase the movie. If these animated movies are going to be geared towards an older audience then there should be more to it than violence and people being murdered. The short running time and the animation that hasn't changed much since the 80's isn't going to do it for me.",1280188800,5,1645,4.636986301369863
4115330,5,B003ES5JDS,"Batman Under the Red Hood is an excellent addition to the DCAU. Bruce Greenwood does an excellent portrayal of Batman that is comparable to Kevin Conroy (GASP!) and John Dimagggio follows in the footsteps of Mark Hammil masterfully. Jense Ackles plays the Red Hood and does a decent job despite his limited acting ability. What makes this such an excellent movie is how all the characters are integrated together without feeling cluttered. Black Mask, Ras al Ghul, the Joker all play an equal part in this intricately woven tale. Some of the other Animated films, specifically the  Justice League ones feel too cluttered and the characters tend to lose themselves. What really makes this film stand tall above the rest is the flashbacks to Batman and Jason Todd in the early years. We get an inside look into the relationship between Batman and Robin as well as how a young Robin grows into a cocky, brash, and violent teenager. Nightwing is a great addition as well. We have never seen many team ups of Batman and Nightwing in the Animated Universe and watching them take on AMAZO and chase down the Red Hood was really fun to watch.
This is one of the better Batman films, but Parents beware, its violent. Put your kids to bed so Dad can watch it by himself. After watching this realtively short film, it leaves you craving a spiritual successor to Batman The ANimated Series; perhaps one with hour long episodes, overarching stories, and more adult themes. I can't get enough of these films. Keep churning them out DC!",1280188800,7,1521,4.739622641509434
4115331,5,B003ES5JDS,"I watched this on the Amazon.com rental because I'm impatient like that. I plan on purchasing the movie now that it's available on DVD. Overall, this is a very dark Batman story, but not without some fun, and some great visuals.

As I mentioned, the story itself is very dark. The movie opens with the death of the second Robin. From there, we go five years into the future where Batman is still protecting Gotham, but by himself. A vigilante named Red Hood has appeared on the scene and is stirring up trouble the criminal territory that Black Mask owns. Batman and Nightwing, the first Robin, head out to investigate this new vigilante, and end up on a chase around Gotham to discover his identity. Added into the mix is the Joker, who is causing mayhem as usual, and Ra's Al Ghul, who has more to do with the Red Hood than anyone would have guessed.

Others have said this, and I agree, that this feels very remiscent of ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" which is definitely a good thing. Batman is dark and troubled by the death of his partner, which has stuck with him after all these years. Nightwing is only in the first half of the movie, but he's perfect as the good-natured, somewhat happy-go-lucky hero who has graduated from the role of Robin. The team-up between him and Batman in the beginning is a lot of fun. Black Mask is fun to watch as the eccentric, increasingly aggitated crime boss who just wants Red Hood dead. The Joker was also a good mix of lunatic and sinister. I was reminded of both the Batman: Animated Series Joker, and the Dark Knight's portrayal, with more of the former. Ra's Al Ghul also has a small role, but comes off very mysterious, and almost morose. I usually don't care for his charcter, but I actually did not mind him in this movie.

The movie in filled with many flashbacks, which are very effective for the storytelling. A lot of them are location-triggered, which adds to the memory effect. The movie ends on a somewhat strange note, leaving me feeling a bit empty. I think it can be interpereted either positively or negatively, depending on how you look at it, which might have been the intention.

All-in-all, I enjoyed this movie very much, and reccomend it for anyone looking for something similar to the Animated series, or just a good Batman movie. The violence in this movie is rather high for an animated feature (note the PG-13 rating), however, so I would not reccomend this film for children. There is blood, explosions, and deaths. The opening scene involves the Joker beating Robin with a crowbar, if that's any indication of the violence level. It's not gory or extremely explicit, but it's definitely not your standard Cartoon Network-level violence.",1280188800,,2710,4.663179916317992
4115332,5,B003ES5JDS,"alot of us know whos under the hood, for those who dont, i envy the revelation. very well done, top to bottom. i wondered if dvd vs. blu-ray would matter for animation, its really better, thats all i can say. Mark Hamill doesnt voice the joker, bummer, but johnny D (bender) does, and does pretty darn good. im putting in five stars, alot for the animated action, well choreographed (how? that wouldve been a great extra feature), mostly for a great story, and a good job of showing so much DCU history in one event without skimping on story.",1280188800,4,542,4.484848484848484
4115333,4,B003ES5JDS,"I've liked most of the DC's recent forays into animation on varying levels, but none of them really hit the mark for me. The scripts in those other titles just weren't good enough and brought the entire production down. Many of them had excellent voice actors and animation, but that couldn't save a poor script.

Batman: Under the Red Hood is different.

Managing to cram five different arcs from the comics into a movie just under 90 minutes is impressive. Managing to do that and keep the entire thing remarkably faithful and have it turn out well is on another level.

The movie starts off with the final moments of the comic arc 'Death in the Family' featured in Batman #426-429, where the Joker sadistically kills Jason Todd aka the second Robin. This scene isn't extremely graphic and most of the violence is kept off screen, but as other reviewers have warned please take the PG-13 rating seriously. From there the story jumps forward five years and compresses Batman #635-650, taking bits and pieces from all four story arcs, to form the rest of the movie. Yes, there are changes. Some are large, including writing out Superboy Prime's role (which is a very very good thing). Others are smaller, from leaving out certain characters and subplots to changing how the Red Hood gets a hold of the Joker. None of these truly matter, as the heart of the story has been distilled and streamlined in a very faithful way.

So faithful are they that some of the dialogue is taken straight out of the comics, including the finale. This is how comic adaptations should be done.

For the most part the cast is excellent, though there will be fans that are disgruntled over fan favorites Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill not contributing. They've defined their respective characters for so long that many, including myself, have a hard time accepting new voice actors in their stead. Bruce Greenwood proved a lot of people wrong though, and I could see him voicing Batman from here on out.

John DiMaggio had the biggest shoes to fill though, and didn't quite do it for me. His Joker was a cross between Ledger's movie portrayal and Hamill's animation counterpart, and while not bad by any means, just didn't sound right to me. It didn't help that I kept hearing Bender from Futurama, either. The laugh was almost perfect, but his speaking voice was just...too husky. This is absolutely going to be up to individual preference though. His line delivery is excellent and there's nothing wrong with his performance. I'm just too used to Hamill, I guess.

The rest of the cast is spot on and practically a dream cast. Neil Patrick Harris is great as the light hearted, cracking wise Nightwing. Jensen Ackles is given the difficult task of voicing a character that covers the entire emotional spectrum during the course of the movie, and does it well. Jason Isaacs is by far the best Ra's al Ghul we've had. But my personal favorite has to be Wade Williams as Black Mask. He IS that character for me now.

Batman: Under the Red Hood is easily on par with Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, that other excellent animated film. It very well may end up being better after additional viewings if I can put Hamill as the Joker behind me. I really hope this is a sign of things to come from DC's animation division.",1280102400,138,3291,4.662068965517242
4115334,5,B003ES5JDS,"Just watched it today, I had to comment about it. People always complain about the voice actors...the cast did great..Batman, Nightwing, RED HOOD..they all sounded great. I'm not going to comment on Joker's voice, instead I will praise his animation...Joker looked GREAT. The movie is much adult oriented this time, ..good. I can't recommend it enough..great moments, shocking and touching at the same time. the final battle, the final scene..the intro music, which is the same played at the end could be used for a live action movie. I want to see more of the guy behind the red hood...

SPOILER ALERT; Remember what Joker does with a pencil in THE DARK KNIGHT?...watch this movie and see what he does..with a glass..and be surprised like I was.....ENJOY IT for what it is, a dark, violent, good BATMAN story.
I would love to see the Killing joke....",1280102400,34,851,4.828767123287672
4115335,4,B003ES5JDS,"I've always liked Batman. No, the comics aren't always great. The movies are either too silly or too serious for my taste and the animated versions seem to keep trying to immitate the 1990's cartoon (with the exception of the fun 'Brave and the Bold'). While I wasn't completely sold on the original comic-story, Batman: Under the Red Hood mixes the darker sensibilities of modern Batman incarnations with the fun and emotional context of the 1990's animated series. The result is surprisingly good.

Like the comic, Batman: Under the Red Hood involves a new vigilante in Gotham city named 'Red Hood'. Unlike Batman, Red Hood kills criminals but seems to be doing a more effective job at cleaning up the city than Batman ever did. As the Dark Knight investigates this new player he's forced to confront past tragedies as well as villains Black Mask and The Joker. The story (written by comics writer Judd Winick) doesn't always ring true and is told a bit un-evenly in parts (usually unvolving some rushed but neccessary exposition and a cool but out-of-place opening fight scene) but the emotional connections between each character keep things grounded and the final confrontation between Batman and the Red Hood is a knockout! The action scenes are also well done, even with the somewhat blocky character designs.

The voice work is quite good for the most part. Bruce Greenwood won't make you forget Kevin Conroy but he's appropriatly brooding as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Wade Williams perfectly mixes fun and psychotic as Black Mask and Jason Isaacs and Neil Patrick Harris give brief but memorable contributions as Ra's al Ghul and Nightwing. I liked John DiMaggio as the Joker for no other reason than that he didn't remind me of any other incarnation (and if he sounds a bit 'off' I blame some uninspired dialogue). As good as these voice actor's were however it's really Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood and Vincent and Alexander Martella as the two different ages of Jason Todd that steal the show and bring real weight to their characters.

While Batman: Under the Red Hood may not be the best Batman story ever, it is a VERY good one. If you're a Batman fan or just looking for a good superhero flick that won't waste too much time (at 75 minutes) this is definitly worth a look!",1280102400,2,2283,4.789340101522843

Adapting his own much maligned comic storyline while writing Batman, Judd Winick's Batman: Under the Red Hood is the latest in the DC/Warner Bros. line of direct-to-video animated features.  Combining the controversial 80s storyline ""A Death in the Family"" with his own ""Under the Hood"" (along with a great nod to Alan Moore's classic ""The Killing Joke"", Winick weaves a tale involving a guilt-ridden Batman (voiced by Bruce Greenwood) who, years after the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin, at the hands of the Joker (voiced by John Di Maggio), finds himself at odds with the vigilante Red Hood (voiced by Supernatural's Jensen Ackles).  Red Hood appears to be carving a deadly path through Gotham City's criminal underworld ruled by Black Mask (voiced by Prison Break's Wade Williams) while at the same time hiding his own agenda with Batman; all of which leads up to the inevitable showdown and revelation.  For those unfamiliar with the comic storyline, Jason Todd was brought back from the dead after years of being one of those ""untouchable"" dead characters in comics (much like Bucky (who also came back from the dead in Captain America around the same time, Gwen Stacy, or Uncle Ben), who meant more in death than they ever did in life.  Winick's storyline wasn't quite praised at the time, although it does seem to fit better here as an animated feature.  That being said, even those who are unfamiliar with Batman comic continuity won't have much trouble figuring out Red Hood's identity.  The animation itself is sharp, some of the voices are well cast, and the feature as a whole is surprisingly quite violent.  With all that being said, the dialogue doesn't quite hold up well, Nightwing (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) comes off as a laughable character, and compared to the past DC Universe features, Under the Red Hood just isn't as enthralling.  Still though, it's worth a look at the very least, and goes down much smoother than Winick's comic storyarc ever did.",1280102400,3,2012,4.928994082840236

4115339,2,B003ES5JDS,"1)Story :  Even though the concept is lifted from the books, it is still good to see animated.

2)Animation: The animation is average.  For some reason it zooms in on the eyes when people are talking lots of the time.  I don't know if that is the ""Style"" or they were lazy with animating speaking mouths.  The backgrounds and vehicles show no style and are poorly done.

3)Voicing :  For voicing ranged from average to bad.  The joker voice was horrible and was one of the 1st ones you get.  With such proven joker voices out there, I fail to see why they went so poorly.

If you are not familiar with the Jason Todd storyline, I will refrain from spoiling it.  It is a sad tale, and as Batman is already a dark and brooding character, this film gives you some insight into the added grief he carries with him.

My only gripe with this film, once again, is the voice casting.  It took me several views to get used to the voice of Batman and the Joker.  Some fans have complained about the voice choice of Nightwing, whom I found a balancing comic relief.  The aforementioned two, however, Joker sounded like he was just getting over a cold, and Batman....I don't know.  Perhaps I've been used to Kevin Conroy for so long, and I loved Bruce Greenwood who voiced the role for Young Justice.  Anyway, a great movie nonetheless!",1525046400,,889,4.472049689440993
