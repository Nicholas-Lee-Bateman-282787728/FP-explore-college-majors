5368648,5,B009TTGLJ2,It is a Christmas gift.  I remember the sitcom.  It was great then and it should be as good as what was on TV.,1355875200,,110,3.5416666666666665
5368649,3,B009TTGLJ2,"No extras, no subtitles, poor package... like season 1. I expected something more for such classic tv show. Such a  shame.",1355443200,5,122,4.809523809523809
5368650,5,B009TTGLJ2,This is a funny show with great characters & funny guest stars. The picture & sound quality was good and the price reasonable enough. It came promptly and was in good condition. I'd highly recommend it.,1355184000,3,202,4.638888888888889
5368651,5,B009TTGLJ2,"This is the best of the best,,certainly recommend this one...got 2 more ordered that they got new...can't wait to see them....",1353974400,3,126,5.0476190476190474
5368652,4,B009TTGLJ2,"I ordered my copy of ALICE: The Complete Second Season as soon as it was announced on the Warner Archive site a few weeks ago to be sure I got pressed discs (instead of DVD-Rs) just like I did for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0089BSLKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice: The Complete First Season</a>. The price was a few dollars cheaper than here too and the cover art and discs follow the same design as the first set--no complaints whatsoever. (**NOTE** The limited-run of pressed discs for Season One has long since sold out and only DVD-Rs are now available--you MUST order early!).

During its' second season on CBS during 1977-78, ALICE was still finding its' footing with a revolving door of producers, writers and directors. Several of the installments this season seem somewhat static and flat compared to Season 1 (see ""The Indian Taker"" or ""The Reporter""). Ironically, this is the year the show jumped into the Top Ten finishing at #8 among all prime-time series for the 1977-78 season, no doubt helped by its' cozy new Sunday-night timeslot following ""All in the Family"" which was enjoying one of its most brilliant seasons ever. The ALICE cast are still delivering on all counts, but the writing and direction lets them down a little. Despite this, ALICE is still ten times better than any of the current sitcoms and there are indeed some series highlights this season. If you don't already own it on the 2006 Best-of disc, ""Close Encounters of the Worst Kind"" is ALICE at its' best when Alice's psychology has the gang at each others' throats; Mel insists he doesn't want any fuss made for ""Mel's Big Five-0""; Jerry Reed makes his first guest appearance in ""Star in the Storeroom"" and Mel is trapped at Alice's apartment with an injury in ""That Old Back Magic""--all classic episodes. This set also boasts guest appearances from George Burns, Desi Arnaz and Morey Amsterdam.

Two episodes that were held back and originally aired as part of Season 4 (""The Reporter"" and ""The Bus"") are included here--as they should be--rounding out the episode total for this set to twenty-four half-hour shows. The video quality is about as good as it was on Warner's Season One set and the great news is they've already announced that Season Three is in the works and we should see it in the first-quarter of 2013! This is when the show REALLY get's cookin'!",1352332800,21,2438,5.077306733167083

5368718,5,B009TTGLJ2,I am so glad they released ALICE on DVD.  I really enjoyed ALICE back in the day.  This DVD has great quality.,1417737600,,110,3.9545454545454546
5368719,4,B009TTGLJ2,Always good to see these older sitcoms.  ALICE is a classic.,1417392000,,60,4.454545454545454
5368720,5,B009TTGLJ2,"I ordered seasons one through three of Alice (I haven't purchased season 4 yet), and am just finishing season one, as I compose this.  So far, the MOD (made on demand) discs appear to be just as good as standard DVD's that I've traditionally limited myself to (although there was a brief hiccup on disc 1 of season 1.. but to be fair, I've occasionally seen a brief hiccup or two on many standard DVD's I own, so who knows...)

Thus far however, I'm very satisfied with the image and audio quality.  For playback, I use an inexpensive Magnavox DVD player, which upconverts standard DVDs to near HD quality, to my HD television.  Long story short, it's  great to be able to view ""Alice"" all over again after not having seen it for more years than I care to count, lol..

Honestly, I find ""Alice"" just as funny now as I remember it to have been.. As always, shipping from Amazon was quick and painless, so I'm eager to finishing viewing all three seasons in the next day or so.  I'm not as reluctant (as I initially was), in ordering MOD discs, because these discs appear to be as good as any other DVD I have.  My first purchase of a MOD DVD (just recently), was for the original Angels in the Outfield (with Janet Leigh and Paul Douglas),  and I was pleasantly surprised with it's quality as well.

Update:  I have since purchased season 4, enjoying it as much as I did the previous 3 seasons.  And again, this MOD disc plays just fine.  I think other positive reviews of season 4 were spot on, so all I will add here is that season 4 is just as enjoyable.  Hopefully, additional seasons will follow.",1415836800,5,1600,4.379661016949153

5368747,5,B009TTGLJ2,"Once a huge ratings sitcom during the late 1970's, Alice is now a prime classic and still as funny as it was back then. The first four seasons are all worth the purchase. What makes Season 2 one of the best collections is that Alice was still in it's infancy while gaining wider popularity. This was when CBS moved the show to Sundays and it became a huge hit, and not surprisingly considering some of the best episodes are included here with examples like the gang getting locked in the storeroom, the earthquake, Alice demanding equal pay for women, Mel's recession, and one of the funniest episodes in TV history with ""Close Encounters of the Worst Kind,' in which everybody decides not to hold back their real feelings. Some of these episodes also helped pave the way for more very funny stories and performances with Season 3.",1395792000,2,831,4.659863945578231

I like it that the show also deals with serious issues.  The show had some great guest stars as well.  I love this show from the opening theme song to the ending credits when Linda Lavin ""scats"" along with the music.  It's one of the best sitcoms ever made and thank goodness, it's on DVD so it can be seen over and over again.  I already have Seasons One, Two and Three and I intend to get more when they come on the market.",1377388800,9,578,4.107142857142857
5368763,5,B009TTGLJ2,"I first watched season 1, and then eagerly opened season 2 of Alice.  I couldn't turn it off, and I watched pretty much the entire season in 2 days.  The second season is probably the best, and I have fond memories of many of these episodes from watching them during summer vacation as a kid. I particularly loved Florence of Arabia!  When I lived in Phoenix going to college, I was extremely homesick and watched Alice every morning during my break.  The characters always felt like family to me, and I still feel like that today.  Corny I know, but this is just a terrific show!  I highly recommend it and hope they will put out more seasons soon.",1374105600,6,649,4.411764705882353

5368797,5,B009TTGLJ2,"I've been waiting a long time for this 2nd season DVD to come out! ""Alice"" is one of those genuinely funny comedies where all the characters work well together, are good friends, share everything, and just blend their lives together in a positive way. Sure it was a sitcom, but after all, and especially moreso in today's world - aren't all those show qualities really what we should be watching and enjoying as we try to escape the madness of the ""real"" world? Sometimes it's good to just sit down, watch some simple problems resolve themselves within less than a 1/2 hour, watch and listen to some laugh-out-loud comedic lines that leave us with a smile. It feels good. And if you are one of those that enjoyed such programming in the 70s and 80s, Alice will not disappoint you.

This series is also great in ""going down memory lane"" - seeing things like pay phones being used and definitely the outfits being worn, will also bring a nostalgic smile to your face!

I'm definitely enjoying Season 2 of ""Alice"" and hope that the next season doesn't take quite so long in coming out!",1358985600,11,1082,4.572164948453608

There is one thing I have noticed in watching this second season.  If I watch more than two episodes in a row,  then it is just too much Vera.  While Beth was a wonderful actress,  the Vera Character got on my nerves really quick.  Too Stupid.  Not to say that she didn't have some really good lines too.  By the second season it was known by most around where I lived as ""Flo"".  I don't even remember anyone around our house saying Alice is on.  We always just said  Flo is on.  Still,  the entire cast was perfect for the show and the characters they played.  They seemed to really work well together.  I didn't care for the type of singing of Linda/Alice, whatever style that is called.  It was a little hard to sit through,  but it usually didn't happen often or last too long.  That's not a shot against Linda,  just the type of music and style of singing/songs.  This show and other shows from the 70's always make me homesick.  Maybe we can never go home again,  but we can watch these old shows and remember a different time.",1508976000,2,1161,4.293023255813954

8544375,4,B009TTGLJ2,"As this 1977-78 Season of this break-out hit sitcom ALICE graced the nations airwaves, Mels Diner soon became the nations dining destination of choice. Thanks to its hearty combination of down-home eccentrics, sweet sentiment, blue-collar ethos, and the spice of edgy topicality, Alice proved a dish the nation could not resist. With the central flavorings of Alice (Linda Lavin), Flo (Polly Holliday), and Vera (Beth Howland) rooting the comedy, and the often disgruntled, Mel (Vic Tayback) and Tommy (Phil McKeon) on hand to balance the distaff waitstaff with curmudgeonly charm and youthful enthusiasm, ALICE was cooking with gas and ready to serve up some sit-com gold.

George Burns, Jerry Reed, Desi Arnaz are among those who get served in the 2nd Season, as the staff faces working holidays, dispossessed natives, divine stars, and the specter of Mels fiftieth in this 3-Disc, 24-Episode collection about this sitcom that ran on CBS for 9 years.
