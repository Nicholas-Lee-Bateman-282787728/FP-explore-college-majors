7827736,5,6302543959,"This is a very sweet film about a man lost who finds himself and what he wants by going back home.  William Petersen (CSI, To Live & Die in LA) is perfect as Joe Starling who left home to become an artist. The supporting cast is wonderful (Rachel Ticotin, Lolita Davidovich, Jeff Kober, Buck Henry, Lois Smith, Jack Palance and Fred Thompson), the scenery is beautiful and William Petersen is just, well, the man is just good looking (as well as a good actor).  It would be nice if Turner Pictures would do a DVD of this film and have updated interviews with the cast. It would be interesting to know what was going on at the time they were making this film.",1267401600,,658,4.341463414634147
7827737,4,6302543959,This is a good story and okay acted movie. Good for one of those snowed in or rainy day don't feel like going anywhere afternoons. It is played out like a real story in that the guy messes up multiple times and does not win everything at the end.,1265155200,,246,4.040816326530612
7827738,5,6302543959,"I enjoyed this movie. William Petersen is awesome in this movie. If you are a fan of his then you will enjoy this movie. As with most movies that is based on a novel, The story differs from it but it is still enjoyable to watch.  If you are looking for a deep movie or one that you need to think about, then this movie is not for you. This is what I would call a non thinking romance type movie. You are suppose to sit and enjoy the story, as well as the play between characters.

I hope that they release it to DVD so I can buy it. I already own the VHS and I am upgrading all my movies to DVD.",1130198400,3,595,3.7903225806451615
7827739,3,6302543959,This movie is very choppy- may different things going on-hard to figure out the point--although William Petersen is as sexy and handsome as on CSI- only younger-- what expression's he has on his beautiful face- can't quite figure out WHY? he never made a BIG film-like Tom Cruise-he's every bit as good- & so georgeous to look at-what a face--YUM-YUM,1072483200,2,350,4.85
7827740,5,6302543959,"I thought this movie was just wonderful. William L Petersen carries this roll well it was well suited for him. It was interesting to watch because just when you thought you had it figured out what was gonna happen it went the other way. If you are a William Petersen fan then you must watch this....I give the movie 5 stars for talent,and great storyline",980553600,8,354,4.461538461538462
7827741,4,6302543959,"If your a William Petersen fan then this movie is a must. William plays Joe Starling who is (darling). Deciding to re-evaluate his life, he heads back to his hometown and takes over his ranch. Meets up with old rivals and old girlfriend, and finds meaning to his life. It's cute and fun and as always, William Petersen is at his best! On a Horse~",975715200,11,346,4.338461538461538
