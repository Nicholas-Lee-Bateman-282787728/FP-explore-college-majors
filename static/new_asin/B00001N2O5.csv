8139722,1,B00001N2O5,"This was a poorly made video.  There is only about ten minutes of worth while content.  The fishing appears to be concentrated on one day spent on two riffles. Most of the video covers how to get there, and the environment itself.  Some of the film explains what type of camping equipment, rain gear to bring, and about the film's producers. Part of the video leaves Kokiak, and goes Tarpon fishing in S. America!  Guessing from the narrator's hair this video was made in the early 80's.  It does not take much to get me interested in watching fishing, but this video just plain sucked. Not worth the time or money.",1128643200,,615,4.504504504504505
