8687339,2,B00PBX847C,"So, nowhere does it state that this is a Blu-ray edition. I got it based off of the description that it's a regular DVD format. Very disappointed we can't watch the movies because we'd first have to purchase a Blu-ray player! Can't rate the films themselves because we haven't watched them. Disappointing.",1432080000,2,305,4.884615384615385
