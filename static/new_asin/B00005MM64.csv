1626944,4,B00005MM64,Those that thought this movie was slow moving don't seem to understand character development or else they only care to watch action/adventures.  This is just a great story about real people.  The under-stated Anthony Hopkins at his best.,1326067200,6,237,5.2105263157894735
1626945,3,B00005MM64,"It's a made-in-Australia drama --comedy, I suppose-- set in the 1960s when jobs were being shipped overseas (sound familiar?).  Take a small business owned by an old man who cherishes his employees but has forgotten how to make a profit, add an outside expert and romance among workers, and you have a film that's enjoyable but in little danger of becoming a classic.  I like the story and much of the acting, but my wife and I wished for subtitles. NOTE:  At the moment, this movie is available in more than one aspect ratio, so check the details.",1317772800,3,548,4.571428571428571
1626946,5,B00005MM64,"Before Anthony Hopkins decided to make a career out of mugging his way through the Hannibal Lecter movies, he made this terrific little film about a small family-owned business that hires an efficiency expert to assess their finances and employees. What sets this aside is the warmth and compassion of the characters involved, who are all well-drawn and interesting, with good relationships to each other. Treading occasionally on Local Hero territory, this film is a gem and deserves as wide an audience as the overrated Hannibal the Cannibal splatter-fest. Hopkins is a brilliant actor when seperated from his Jack Nicholson moments, and shines in this movie. Highly recommended.",1299801600,3,681,5.314814814814815
1626947,4,B00005MM64,"Flawless production, coupled with sparse (which is unfortunate) musical selections of the Sixties, this unsung but gratifying little film captures beautifully the discovering/rediscovering of true, basic human needs from the vantage point of two separate generations and social classes.
With the current scourge of globalization, it strikes a very poignant chord when an ""efficiency expert"" (the ever versatile Anthony Hopkins)  comes to investigate the dwindling profits of a small town shoe-manufacturing firm. He is occupied with cold facts and figures rather than compassion and dignity for the workers as he decides that 50% of the company could be laid off in the interests of getting the firm out of the red.
There's financial consulting, change management, resistance to change, the usual works. Then something happens that changes his perspective on his consulting recommendations, specifically a (doozy) car racing event.
In its denouement, the movie goes somewhat Polyanna (how one wishes such ""solutions"" were possible in the real world) but the cosy, relaxed pacing of the movie and its simple lessons make this a worthy rental.
Oh, and if Russel Crowe is the reason you're renting this, beware: he has a small part, I should have guessed this, the movie is from 1992 and he was still a budding Australian actor.",1078617600,17,1325,5.309523809523809
1627009,4,B00005MM64,"I recognized Toni Collette's voice before I even saw her or knew she was in it. A waste of a very young Russell Crowe. A sweet, tender film with Anthony Hopkins usual perfection. Angela Punch-McGregor was ill used. Amazing actress from We of the Never Never and she is never in anything anymore.",1395273600,2,295,4.584905660377358
1627010,3,B00005MM64,"It's a ""cute"" movie. I'm not really into ""cute""....I like sci-fi and thrillers and good romances. This has a little of everything and is entertaining. But I wouldn't watch it twice.",1386288000,,181,4.870967741935484
1627011,4,B00005MM64,"The cover is misleading, though. Didn't capture the characters accurately. Caught a brief look at a rare exhibit of a carefree, effusively happy Hopkins character. His characters are usually so reserved.",1384992000,,203,5.580645161290323
1627012,4,B00005MM64,"I think this movie is wonderful.  It uses just plain people along with a big star or two.  It contains material to make one think about their own life and priorities along with being entertaining.  I don't think it is for the majority of people of this day and age since there is no blood, drugs, special effects, foul language, half-naked pretty people parading around with multiple partners, etc.  Well worth the time to watch unless you are looking for a multimillion dollar production....better look elsewhere.  This one is a bit slow at times, but entertaining nonetheless.  A favorite of mine.",1377216000,,599,4.881188118811881
1627013,4,B00005MM64,"Good movie, setting is in the early 70's in the Melbourne Australia area. Depicts the decline of a small business and the lack of desire for the business owner to make changes. Hopkins plays an efficiency expert who is brought in to help the company, but soon realizes there is no desire by anyone to change. This is a drama with many humorous moments.",1373500800,,352,4.515625
1627014,3,B00005MM64,"This is some sort of comedy drama that features some good actors but also has a story that isn't all that interesting. Too bad, because it had some potential.",1369440000,,158,4.482758620689655
1627015,3,B00005MM64,"So so story, not Hopkins nor Crowe's best part.  Maybe  just a little outdated by todays standards, but all in all entertaining.",1363996800,,128,4.7727272727272725
1627016,4,B00005MM64,"Tony's still the best!! Sweet and different film, seriously is there anything n acting Hopkins can't do??!...add this to ur collection",1362960000,,134,5.428571428571429
1627017,1,B00005MM64,I ordered based on the acting of Anthony Hopkins.  This was a bad decision.  Not worth the time to view or money.,1359417600,,113,4.090909090909091
1627018,5,B00005MM64,"Great cast, great movie, I have been looking for this movie for a long time.  So happy to find it.  by the way Russell Crowe is in it.....",1353456000,3,138,3.892857142857143
7945788,1,B00005MM64,Full screen. Shows its listed as widescreen but I received a full screen version.,1514332800,,81,4.857142857142857
7945789,5,B00005MM64,This is one of the masterpieces of anticapitalist comedy. At bottom perhaps this films subtext has become a potboiler; Middle class white man searches for redemption from our depraved economic system. Very funny and deeply perceptive including a great cast of unknowns. If you want to understand what has happened to us' see this movie!,1503532800,,336,5.127272727272727
7945790,4,B00005MM64,took a long time but good,1500508800,,25,3.3333333333333335
7945791,5,B00005MM64,"Wonderful movie.  So now it's 2016 and the era of the Efficiency expert is slowing down... they recommended down sizing & out-sourcing to other countries and they never dreamed that their own jobs could be exported & automated.  Fortunately for most small, medium size businesses of that era the efficiency experts final reports often became coffee-table wear.  These medium size businesses were more so attacked & swallowed  by big business whose  ability to manipulate law & public custom were the weapons of choice...
The efficiency experts can still find jobs in big consulting companies that feed on the Federal Government... they still make coffee-table ware: strategic plans, business plans, and  efficiency reports which government senior executives are more than happy to hide behind.  It really beats having to make a decision now & then... and they are still oblivious to the biggest asset most companies & government agencies have, people.",1474156800,,951,5.3
7945792,5,B00005MM64,"An excellent movie! It was fun, touching and splendidly done. The vintage slot car racing scenes truly make this a must have film for all slot car racers. It's just boss!  Anthony Hopkins is a gem.",1461456000,,197,4.472222222222222
7945793,5,B00005MM64,One of my favorite movies. It's the sort of story that leaves you feeling pleasantly entertained and puts a smile on your face. The cast is magnificent and the humor delightful.,1433376000,,177,4.741935483870968
7945794,5,B00005MM64,"If you have not seem this, you are missing out.  This may not be a new release, but it really hits home if you work for a company that is always changing things that have worked well...just because someone who does not know your job, tells you how to do it better.  We all know that change is not always a good thing, and not always a bad thing.  You can put your feet up and have a giggle with this one.",1419984000,,404,3.902439024390244
7945795,4,B00005MM64,OK movie.  Very young Russell Crowe.,1419984000,,36,5.0
7945796,5,B00005MM64,"I'm a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins' work and he certainly did not disappoint in: The Efficiency Expert.

This is an original, sweet story with a supporting cast of oh- so- quirky characters, who deliver plenty of laughs, along with a message about what really matters in business and personal life.

For anyone who thinks this movie is slow-paced, I agree with another reviewer here, I think they've missed the point a bit. That's how these workers were suppose to be. Marching to their own drum but ever loyal in their rather misguided way to the company they had worked for, for so many years. Through the good and lean years along the way.

If you like Anthony Hopkins, you will love this movie. :-)",1418688000,,701,4.592
7945797,4,B00005MM64,This was a great cast and I loved the ending- how appropriate for the person portrayed by Russell Crowe to take on a position as an efficiency expert  at the end - he wld relish the position...,1396483200,,193,4.216216216216216
