475950,5,6302530032,"I bought this tape and Vol. 2 back in 1997, a few years after they had been first released. (I remember being overjoyed to discover that now I could get Black Sabbath on VHS.) It is absolutely essential for anyone who calls themselves a Black Sabbath fan. I don't mean this as demeaning to those fans who don't have it, it's just that I had thought that I knew the whole Black Sabbath story and still learned new things about the way they were during Ozzy Osbourne's tenure with them.
In this video, we get great performances from Black Sabbath doing some of their best songs, such as ""N.I.B.,"" ""War Pigs,"" ""Paranoid,"" and ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath."" Actually, my favorite video is the last one: a BBC Top Of The Pops performance of ""Never Say Die"" from their 1978 album of the same same name, their last one with Ozzy. There are many insightful interviews, especially with Tony Iommi, who gets credit only for being a great guitarist but not enough for being an intelligent, throughtful and well-spoken individual. He is quiet-mannered, yet is forthcoming when talking about the band, and reveals some very interesting information which showed how much I didn't know about them. Drummer Bill Ward and bass guitarist Tony ""Geezer"" Butler are also very forthcoming, the latter in particular about his drug abuse. And yes, one of the videos shown is the Bill-Ward sung ""It's Alright!"" THE BLACK SABBATH STORY really is essential for helping you understand the whole story about one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
MOST RECOMMENDED, FOR FANS AND CURIOUS ALIKE",1083888000,39,1562,4.810408921933085
475951,4,6302530032,"The DVD is a Great item, and works well in this format. Plays best in a THX system. It's a Great Overview for any new or old fan of the original group. The time of the disc ( 85 Minutes) refers to the full disc content. This is a great disc if you don't like the Non-Ozzy Sabbath lineup. Disc one is potentially for one set of fans, and the second DVD has a different appeal, but this explains why the discs are separate, and it is not a ""Grab the Cash"" concept ( as in the way Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley do their Shtick).",1039219200,6,525,3.9622641509433962
475952,3,6302530032,"I like about 3/4 of this DVD. BUT, they included some of the poorest songs from the albums Technical Ecstacy (the song with Bill Ward, the drummer, singing is HORRIBLE) and some of the weaker songs from their last album with OZZY Never Say Die. THEY COULD HAVE INCLUDED THE GOOD SONGS FROM THOSE TWO ALBUMS, but instead, they gave us [poo]. ALSO, the DVD is not anywhere near as long of playing time as claimed on the back cover.",1035417600,5,429,4.375
475953,4,6302530032,"good nostalgic music,good footing but don't imagine that it is top of the line video and sound quality,still a must for black sabbath fans",1032566400,,138,4.791666666666667
475954,4,6302530032,"The interview with Geezer and Tony is interesting while it gives a ""human"" view of their incredible performances. The best moments are from early live concerts. Parts are in Paris and include NIB. My preferred moment is a very poor quality black and white shot of Children of the Grave in the US. Only the mediums survived on the sound track ... which is again sad for Bill and Ozzie that have most of their part outside this frequency scope. I would hope that at some point better vintage material will come out, but in the meantime this is extremely valuable.",981849600,7,561,4.564356435643564

476016,2,6302530032,"But today, most of this material exists in *far* better quality on youtube. For example, the Cal Jam footage is now color whereas on this DVD it is only B&W. And the Paris 1970 footage is not the original master here. Finally, the interviews are not very enlightening. If you want more interesting interview material (as opposed to a full concert) get the Last Supper DVD.",1356998400,,372,4.651515151515151
476017,2,6302530032,"i was looking for the definitive Black Sabbath dvd, something along the lines of what Led Zeppelin or KISS did with their dvd packages-- this ain't it. it looks as if VH1 produced this! i know they didn't, but, it looks like one of their 'Behind The Music'-jobs. 'Sabbath could've/should've put more stuff on there. i know there's a Vol. 2, but Vol. 1 wasn't all that-- plus, it covered the time frame i was interested in, The Ozzy Years. maybe, someday they'll get it together.",1295049600,,478,4.569767441860465
476018,5,6302530032,"I'm a fan but this was a gift for a friend.  He loves it!  Great coverage of the band and their tumultuous ties with Ozzy.  Interviews, videos live shows it's got what you're looking for!",1284681600,,187,4.285714285714286
476019,5,6302530032,"I am a collector. So, I had to have this and it's a good documentary. Really cool to watch. If your a new fan and want to get an overview of how the started. This is a good one to get.

Enjoy!",1231632000,,192,3.5714285714285716
476020,4,6302530032,"The footage on this isn't too bad. Some great songs, however there could be some better ones as well.
It is a must have for SABBATH fans.
There is an interview with the old manager that is pretty insightful.
Lots of little tid bits that none of us would have ever known about
early SABBATH history.
There is a cool story about OZZY beating up
a police officer when he was younger.
The sound quality is great, except its not really in wide screen.
It appears as if production added some cheesy looking black bars to the top of the screen.
Drummers will love all of the close ups of BILL WARD pounding
on his set.",1208217600,,611,4.275862068965517
476021,4,6302530032,"It was great seeing, firsthand, the early Black Sabbath days, before the split up, fighting and he said, he said!  I loved it!",1207526400,,126,4.478260869565218
476022,5,6302530032,"I bought this video on VHS over 10 years ago and nearly wore it out. Great footage of the original Sabath line - up. We get to hear a new song called ""War Pigs"" from the ""new album"", with Bill Ward playing a single bass drum kit. The whole band wears jeans and sneakers in early footage and in a few short years Bill has a double bass and the band is wearing platform shoes w/satin (?) pants. This is the best overview of Sabbath from the 70's. The interviews are apparently from the era before the Reunion when apparently they didn't anticipate Ozzy returning. It's actually a pleasure hearing the interviews with Tony and Geezer without Ozzy's big mouth. Another great thing about this video is that the interviews are in between songs not during them and now that it's on DVD you can actually skip over the parts that you don't like. Also includes bonus track ""A Hard Road"" not on the VHS version. Tony and Geezer tell Ozzy stories and reminince about the early days. Personal favorite is the one about Ozzy beating up a doped up fan who was beating up his little boy in the audience. Overall, it seems short and will make you want to rewind (skip backward) to hear it again. This isn't one of those documentaries that drags on forever (e.g. Some Kind of Monster - ugh), but rather keeps you watching and holds your interest. Also it doesn't contain any back biting or bad mouthing just good natured remininces from Tony and Geezer.",1169942400,5,1435,4.480916030534351
476023,5,6302530032,"I have had this video now for almost 10 years, and it is now available on DVD.  But to this date, there is no DVD that even compairs to this one as far as the history and footage shown. The live videos and rare tunes played in this documentary is worth every penny i originally paid for it. I still can't believe the footage from Ontario motor Speedway in 1974, showing the massive crowd that Sabbath played, just spectacular. This video covers through early 1978, and touches on Ozzy leaving, but you'll need tape two to see that.  On DVD, the 1978 year is completed on DVD 1 ending with ""a hard road"" and ozzy leaving. So this is a must have for any sabbath fan, and don't foget to buy the Black sabbath story Volume 2 to complete the set.",1153785600,3,741,4.24822695035461
476024,3,6302530032,"I enjoyed the band interviews that are interspersed throughout the DVD--although there were no (recent) Ozzy interviews--and particularly the interview with the band's first manager, Jim Simpson, who had some interesting insights to share on the band's origins.  I also thought the ""Band History"" section of the DVD as a whole was pretty informative (there's even a brief Cozy Powell interview).

Having said all that, I was disappointed in the overall production of this DVD from the moment I opened it up.  The sound isn't all that great, but I can forgive that considering how old a lot of the footage is.  But the major sins are:

*  No insert booklet (That spells C-H-E-A-P.  I mean, come on!)

*  The ""Extras"" section is comprised solely of two 90-second interviews with Tony Iommi, in which he grumbles about the state of modern heavy metal, and Bill Ward, and I'm not really sure just what he was talking about.

*  The ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" video has almost two minutes lopped off the end

*  The live footage of ""Symptom of the Universe"" and ""Snowblind"" was taken from the ""Never Say Die"" tour.  I would rather have seen footage from when those songs were released.

I noticed in a couple of the reviews that some people mentioned the DVD being shorter than the 85 minutes advertised.  Although I haven't timed it, I think if you add up all the various features (""Band History,"" etc.) it will be closer to 85 minutes.

I almost gave this DVD 2 stars for not even having a booklet, so I will recommend it with an asterisk.",1135900800,6,1534,4.643122676579925
