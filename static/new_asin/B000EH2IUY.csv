2518654,4,B000EH2IUY,"An okay movie...good story...but slow paced.  The action is there, the actors are all good, but I have seen better movies of this kind.  All in all, an okay film.",1354838400,,162,4.366666666666666
2518655,4,B000EH2IUY,"This is a great real life story.  The lady had great courage, surviving alone in the wilderness.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes wilderness/ animal stories.",1336608000,,174,4.9655172413793105
2518656,5,B000EH2IUY,"This is a true story and a testimony to the indomitable spirit of one woman. Raised in high society, she courts and marries a gold miner from Alaska. Removed from her familiar life style, she finds herself in the rough, alien environment of Alaska's pre-state frontier Territory.

Learning to cope isn't easy at first. With time though Martha venerates the title 'pioneer woman' with characteristic independence and enthusiasm that typifies frontier settlers.

While adapting to her new home she became seriously wounded during an earthquake while her husband at the same time becomes injured and unable to return home. To make matters worse, she faces a winter alone and pregnant. Unaware of the fate of her husband and completely isolated from another human being she successfully prepares for winter and deliveres her child alone.

Finding courage in her Christian faith, she survives the winter holding on to a hope that her husband would return to her after the ice leaves. Over time she discovers a deep abiding love for the wild frontier she calls home.

I highly recommend this film to women who love true adventure stories.",1330819200,5,1132,5.037433155080214
2518657,5,B000EH2IUY,It is a little campy and perhaps not Jill Eikenberry's best acting work but it is a terrific story and I love having it on DVD.  The rustic setting in Alaska makes a beautiful backdrop for this story of determination and survival.  Just enjoy it!,1322179200,,246,4.444444444444445
2518658,5,B000EH2IUY,"I have a rare copy of ""O' Rugged Land of Gold"" which this movie was made. I viewed the movie when it first aired on TV and since then have watched the video and DVD versions, and read the book, many times over. This is the wonderful true story about Martha Martin and how she and her son came to live in Alaska with her new husband. Martha endured many hardships that were conquered through self-taught survival skills. This is probably Jill Eikenberry's best movie role.",1304380800,9,471,4.488372093023256
2518659,5,B000EH2IUY,"""Timid widow Martha Martin didn't know quite what to expect when she moved with her new husband Don and her son Lloyd to the remote Alaskan wilderness in 1954. But nothing could prepare her for this unforgiving, unpredictable land, filled with dangerous Grizzlies, earthquakes, and brutal winters. Don's brusque prospecting partner (Graham Greene) claims it's a place for hunting gold - not for raising a family; and Martha doubts that she can rebuild her life in such a harsh, unrefined land. But when Don and Lloyd disappear in an accident, a pregnant and injured Martha is forced to find new strength to face seemingly insurmountable challenges - including delivering her own baby alone in the wilderness - if she is to survive and be reunited with her family. Based on a true story, this compelling film is the inspiring drama of one woman's incredible courage and of a family's undying love and unity.""",1261180800,11,907,4.934640522875817
2518660,5,B000EH2IUY,"This movie is extremely moving .You can't believe all that
Jill Eikenberry goes through in this story of{ a woman of extreme indulgence and privelage }, she has to rise to the most horrendous of circumstances and find a way to survive in the wilderness of Alaska once she's left alone , when her son is missing and her new husband takes off to find him !

2518664,5,B000EH2IUY,"This is one of those really good family movies that got lost in the shuffle. I would give it 10 stars if I could.

2518682,5,B000EH2IUY,"Excellent movie! Acting was good, but story line is great!",1413158400,,58,4.9
2518683,3,B000EH2IUY,"The story portrays a socialite, rich woman who meets an Alaskan gold prospector and their struggles to make a life in the harshness of the Alaskan frontier. When her son goes missing and her husband goes off to find him, the woman undergoes the greatest test of her entire life, as for months she fends for herself, deals with injuries and has a baby.

While the movie is good and does an excellent job at keeping your interest, even if you hadn't seen on the credits that this is a family channel movie, you'd know it as it's quite obviously a low budget cable movie. One can't help but wonder what might have transpired for the story had there been a bigger budget. Perhaps we could have also seen her husband and son's struggle to survive after they became lost, since it's mentioned at the end that her husband had even worse injuries and an even greater difficult path to survival with only her son to help keep them both alive. I certainly would have enjoyed seeing that right alongside the woman's struggle rather than ONLY seeing her difficulties.

Also, if the husband and son had such a perilous experience and it was the son who kept the husband alive, why at the end does the son look like he's just been playing in the snow for a couple hours? His leather fringe jacket had a couple more fringe strands broken off than before, but that's it. Otherwise he looked fine, while the husband looked like death warmed over. But hey, it's a made for cable movie, so there's bound to be inconsistencies. 3.25 stars",1405209600,2,1518,4.516363636363637

2518686,2,B000EH2IUY,"Loved the book, tolerated the movie.  It missed the whole point of the book, which was a woman surviving in the wilderness.  Better than no movie, I guess, but I was very disappointed",1396396800,,183,4.515151515151516

2518704,3,B000EH2IUY,"Incredible scenery throughout the movie.  Unfortunately that's all I found redeeming.  The acting was poor, at best, and the story was impossible to believe.  It was fine for watching one time, so borrow it from a friend if they have it, if only for the breath-taking scenery.  Not worth buying, in my opinion.",1384646400,2,310,4.7924528301886795

2518709,1,B000EH2IUY,"This movie is supposed to be ""based on a true story"" but very loosley based I would say! If you have never read the book this movie might be ok at best. The book ""O Rugged Land Of Gold"", set in the early 1900's not midcentury like portrayed in this movie. There is so little actual truth to this movie that is like another story altogether. The main character (Jill Eikenberry) acting is morose and unbelieable. The son (Lloyd) is disrespectful to adults and lied for his mother which she thanked him for! Pathetic excuse for a family movie, whether you have read the book or not. I loved the book though.",1375142400,6,605,4.410714285714286
2518710,4,B000EH2IUY,"I thought that the man could have been more honest as to his intentions for his bride and her son.

2518716,5,B000EH2IUY,"Rugged Gold was an awesome movie!  It's the kind of movie the entire family can watch and you don't have to worry about vulgarity or anything sexual appearing in this one, so make sure the kids see this one!  What's even better, the movie is based upon true events.",1365465600,,265,4.387755102040816
2518717,5,B000EH2IUY,"The book that this movie is based off of, O Rugged Land of Gold, was written by my great grandmother  (under the pen name Martha Martin, real name was Helen Bolyan). Lloyd's name is really Clyde, my grandfather. I asked him after the movie first came out and we watched it, if he was as much of a brat as he was portrayed in the movie and he told me he was always a good boy. But the twinkle in his eye made me think otherwise :-)

My grandfather was born in 1915. The book states that my great grandmother complied events from her life to write the story. The movie loosely portrayed the book, for example the set it in the 50s. My dad was born in 43, so my grandpa couldn't have been a little boy in the 50s :-)  There really was a mine. It's located on the Chichagoff Island. You can read how it came to be here:
