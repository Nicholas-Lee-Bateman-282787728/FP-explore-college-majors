8336181,5,B001QQA1NI,"This is another of Charles Smiley's great video's, and the third of the four that compile this series ( the Southern Pacific is the fourth movie for me). The other's in the series ( the Western Pacific, the Union Pacific, and the Santa Fe) show railroading in the 40's, the 50's, and 60's, If you are interested in this era, the Western Pacific, along with the others, is a must-have. The transference from film to DVD disk is, for the most part, just perfect! A great DVD!",1407542400,,473,4.448275862068965
