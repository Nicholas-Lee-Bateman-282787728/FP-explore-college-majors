2510051,4,B000E8QVD8,"Conspiracy Theory  DVD

This movie reminds me of Bird on a Wire  where Goldie Hawn is the lead female, a lawyer, here it is a red-headed Julia Roberts playing a Justice Department lawyer with Mel Gibson being chased by Agents.

Bird on a Wire  was made in 1990

Conspiracy Theory made in 1997.

Short memory.

Just because you're paranoid , doesn't mean nobody is out to get you.

I enjoyed both films.

Recommended for fans of Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.

2510052,5,B000E8QVD8,It was a great movie when I first saw back in the 80's and I still enjoy watching it whenever it is on! Great story line. What a man wouldn't do for his true love but sometimes the simpleless way is the best way!,1202428800,3,212,3.840909090909091
2510053,4,B000E8QVD8,"Great value for Mel Gibson fans. Tequila Sunrise includes Kurt Russell and Michelle Pfeifer in a cop/smuggler/romance story that has some decent acting and action. This one alone sells in the $12.99 range. Conspiracy Theory has Mel, Julia Roberts and Patrick Stewart in a crazy story of trying to understand if there really is a conspiracy and if there is, which conspiracy is it. A decent thriller that runs around 9.99. So the two in this set normally run over $20 around six dollars in shipping. Here you can get them both for about $16.00  or less including the shipping. I recommend this DVD set. I bought it and I enjoy both movies.",1188345600,3,638,4.646017699115045
