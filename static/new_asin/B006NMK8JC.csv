8501413,5,B006NMK8JC,"I was so thrilled to receive my copy of ""Martini The Movie"", after waiting what seemed like an ETERNITY since it premiered in Early 2009.  It was so nice to get more than just one movie on the DVD.  I was most thankful for the photos of the movies, and the outtakes! They were hysterical!! My MOST Favorite Outtake was from ""Martini the Movie"", with Robert Camina tapping on the bottles at the bar. He had the funniest face! IT was great!  My other favorite was the outtakes from ""Hunter for Love"", the, ""I don't do this, I don't do that"", guy! What a riot!

Thank you Robert L. Camina for such excellent work, and for making me smile and laugh... LOTS!

I look forward to MORE MORE MORE!!",1324771200,,689,4.310077519379845
