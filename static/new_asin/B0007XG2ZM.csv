8053378,4,B0007XG2ZM,This item was in excellent brand new condition. The tape itself was of poor quality particularly in regards to the audio. This was no fault of the seller's though. I think they all were made like this and I was just happy to at least get a copy.,1430524800,,245,4.125
8053379,4,B0007XG2ZM,"The Blockhouse is a movie about six men forced into work camps by the Nazi's in World War II. On the day of the 1944 Normandy invasion the allies shelled the beaches, these men were forced to take shelter in a concrete bunker/blockhouse. These six  men took shelter all the way into the blockhouse, the bombing had blocked all the exits.  The men were able to find candles and stacks of food for German officers that would last them for years, little did they realize that it would take until 1951 before they would be found by a French work crew. Only two men survived. It was estimated that they had run out of candles and were in complete darkness for at least four years. The film quality is not the greatest, but the acting and directing are so good that I had to pause this film every so often and run outside for fresh air. Do not watch this if you are claustrophobic it will make you panic. This is a gritty movie and not for the faint of heart, but I loved it. Sellers and Kemp are excellent actors and it was worth watching their performances. I gave the movie four stars only because the film quality was not great.",1320278400,,1126,4.306603773584905
8053380,4,B0007XG2ZM,"Based on the true story of seven Allied prisoners sealed inside an underground German bunker after the D-Day invasion, ""The Blockhouse"" is a hidden gem in the Peter Sellers filmography. Director Clive Rees transforms this claustrophobic nightmare into a quietly effective drama. Sellers' detailed performance as the French teacher is a revelation  ample proof that he could step outside the comedic realm. Charles Aznavour, Jeremy Kemp and Peter Vaughan give equally compelling portrayals in a strong ensemble cast. ""The Blockhouse"" was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1973 and then unceremoniously buried in a British vault. Except for a few screenings, the film remained unseen until its VHS debut in the mid-1980s. This DVD release includes the widescreen version with better sound and picture quality. Not for all tastes, but a must-see for Sellers admirers.",1240617600,3,881,5.430656934306569
8053381,2,B0007XG2ZM,"Peter Sellers delivers a fine performance, as do all of the other actors. It's an amazing, important, TRUE story, that deserves to be told. However, the method in which the director has chosen to convey the story, leaves a lot to be desired.

Material for a great documentary? Absolutely! A rewarding viewing experience as a film? I'm afraid not.",1235692800,,346,4.864406779661017
8053382,4,B0007XG2ZM,"I'll wager a bet than most Americans-even Seller's most devoted fans-have never even heard of(much less seen)this terrific film.
In my opinion, that is a real shame, as this is a straight DRAMATIC role, the exact kind that Sellers got too few chances to perform and-in my humble opinion-was every bit as creative and effective in as his signature comedic roles.

Set in a dim, dreary, claustrophobic WWII bunker(lit exclusively by candlelight)it's poignant yet entirely without a trace of maudlin, in it's tale of a ragtag group of labor camp prisoners trapped for a harrowing six years beneath a German bunker, struggling to keep themselves alive body and soul.  The bunker is well-stocked with food, beverages, etc. yet the body count continues to rise notwithstanding.  The film's message is clear:for Man to sustain life(and the very desire to KEEP alive), then love, affection and GENUINE caring is AT LEAST as necessary as supplying the body with it's more rudimentary needs of food, water, etc.

Sellers really tore at my heart with his simply stunning, unadorned portrayal of a French school teacher who's intent on sustaining the spirit to survive in his fellow prisoners. His quiet strength of character makes this one of my all-time favourite roles that Sellers created in his long film career.  Those sad, dark, empty eyes of his stayed in my psyche LONG after the movie had ended.
Had the screenwriter given Sellers not one word to utter through the entire film, his performance would STILL have touched my heart deeply.

Note:this excellent film is FINALLY available on a U.S. playable format!  Do yourself a BIG favour and check it out!",1135296000,,1651,5.0036496350364965
8053383,3,B0007XG2ZM,"""The Blockhouse"" is a film rife with good intentions but, alas, good intentions do not a great film make.  It is noble of the filmmakers to portray men in a desperate situation trying to maintain their spirits and sanity.  That said, even at the 92 minutes that the film clocks in at it's difficult for the viewer to retain their spirits let alone interest.  Director Clive Rees films the men trapped in an underground bunker in natural candlelight and it appears that he allows his international cast, led by Peter Sellers, to improvise with no music to cue our emotions.  In this regard the film is only marginally successful.  It's not to say that this cannot be effective.  Some may laugh, but think of Tom Hanks in Robert Zemeckis' ""Castaway"".  As for Peter Sellers, some may think this is a vanity project for him but it's anything but.  Sellers is effectively subdued in a rare dramatic role for him and graciously shares the screen with his supporting cast.",1128902400,7,965,4.7023809523809526
8053384,5,B0007XG2ZM,"The ""real life horror story"" of The Blockhouse is haunting but understanding why Sellers would play a role of such claustrophobic intensity makes the film both harrowing and amazing.  Nine years earlier was Dr. Strangelove with its psychotic view of international relations (Mutually Assured Destruction writ large upon the screen).  Then, at the age of 48 and after years of failed movies and in failing health himself he took on The Blockhouse, conveying the same ""war is absurd"" message but at a supremely personal level, and this time with a stunningly subtle performance.  Where Sellers had been able to exceed the pain threshold of comedy like no one before or since (re: Hyrundi V. Backshi pantomiming through ten excruciating minutes searching for a restroom to relieve himself), he did so in this film by the mere tweak of an eyebrow.

In The Blockhouse, Sellers and his cohorts (WWII labor camp prisoners), are trapped by Allied bombing inside tunnels offering all the amenities they'd been starved of by their German captors.  They quickly find, however, they have everything needed for survival except a means of escape.  It's the worst possible situation, but it's Sellers' character -- Rouquet, a French schoolteacher - who becomes the very essence of integrity for the others.  Through him the group maintains civility by having a way to judge the passing of time - a feat accomplished by Rouquet counting his own heartbeats to measure how long candles are lasting.  This is where the film becomes truly harrowing, as we're more than aware that Sellers had survived a massive heart attack a decade before the release of the film.  Thus we suddenly find ourselves trapped along with the other prisoners into relying on Seller's heart (and sanity -- of all things) as he obsessively, yet perfunctorily counts heartbeats until the lights will literally go out.  Rouquet (Sellers?) even makes the almost resigned (chilling) observation that he can continue doing so ""Only as long as my heart keeps beating.""

Eventually Rouquet realizes there is no dignified escape and thus quietly, and neatly, slits his wrist into a bag of flour (the only material on hand by which to bury those who die), culminating the scene by using his own blood to snuff out the last of his candles  -- the hiss of which haunts one long after the film has ended.

Sellers' role in this film is a revelation, but The Blockhouse is also a bookend to Strangelove in that both are exceptionally anti-war films but from opposing styles and approaches.  What they share is a view that war is the very summit of absurdity and thus irony taken to its naturally painful conclusion (a Sellers' stock in trade, thus both films are perfect for him).  Strangelove, however, is extroverted madness (chaos and kinetic energy) while Blockhouse is madness turned in upon itself (it may be the closest viewers, or Sellers himself, ever came or will come to finding the hidden center to the man).  The latter also features no musical soundtrack while Strangelove blares When Johnny Comes Marching Home throughout.  And where Strangelove ends in multiple mushroom clouds, Blockhouse extinguishes the screen to total blackness as Rouquet douses the light of his candle -- one can only imagine what it must have been like to experience that effect in a theater.

As this film is autobiographical by the very nature of Sellers repeatedly claiming he had no ""self"" other than his characters, it is truly a terrifying glimpse of what it must have been like to be Peter Sellers, and as such, a must have for anyone hoping to understand his genius - or The Blockhouse that may be inside us all.",1122940800,11,3653,4.912195121951219
8053385,3,B0007XG2ZM,"Since no one has reviewed this film, I will give it a go. This is the true and unbelievable story of 7 - 8 men on D-Day June 6, 1944. During the allied bombing on that day forced laborers took cover in a german blockhouse (underground bunker) which held supplies such as food and ammo. These bunkers led deep underground. The bombing was so heavy that it actually burried these 7 - 8 men alive (there are conflicking reports on how many were actually burried, 7 or 8. From what I read (and this is pretty accurate), there they stayed. In 1952 while a construction team worked near the beach area, they removed some debree, and from out of the ground appeared some of these men, still alive, while history passed them by. What happened during that time? That is what this film evolves around. With the bombing, all electricity was virtually destroyed underground. This is probabally one of the most dismal and at various times boring films you will ever see, but just the same, it is interesting to watch. Action? Just a bit at the beginning during the bombing. Apparently there was a book put out about this event, but I believe it is out of print, and there is not much on the internet about it. I would not call this a war film, but a survival film. Peter Sellers blends in with the rest of the unknown cast, and there is no humor here. Watch it as a late night film, in the dark, because about 85 - 90 percent of the film is in the dark. The MGM release should be a lot more clearer in viewing then the older VHS release (by Paragon Video). Deserves 3 1/2 stars for authenticity.",1118534400,4,1582,4.347972972972973
