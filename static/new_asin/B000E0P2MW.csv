8103554,4,B000E0P2MW,"""Malgudi Days"" was a much appreciated series on state run Indian television. The series itself was dramatization of R.K. Narayan's collection of short stories. All stories happen in the fictional town of Malgudi in pre-independence India and are an interesting social insight in the rural India rarely seen in the cliched Bollywood productions or even in so called progressive Indian cinema.
A must for anyone interested in Indian cinematological history.",1255910400,3,455,5.514285714285714
8103555,5,B000E0P2MW,"After reading some of the reviews on Amazon of the 2-Disc Collector's Set of  R.K. Narayan's ""Malgudi Days"", I felt compelled to write my own perspective.  R.K. Narayan was one of 20th century's greatest writers-most certainly one of India's finest-who was short listed for the Nobel Prize in Literature several times.  ""Malgudi Days"" was directed by the highly gifted late Shankar Nag for India's TV channels in the 1980s.  Of the 39 episodes that were aired at the time, this collector's set contains a select thirteen.  The set comes with a booklet which serves as a guide to the phenomenon of ""Malgudi Days"".  R.K. Narayan, elder brother of famous Indian cartoonist-R.K. Laxman, has conceived of an imaginary village called ""Malgudi"" in Southern India.  At first glance, Malgudi may seem as far off from present society as could possibly be and especially so for city dwellers, but on closer inspection one recognizes the genius of R.K. Narayan that has captured-in insignificant Malgudi-the essence of human culture that could be found anywhere in the world.  The stories essentially take place in Southern India, and Nag's superb direction serves to beautifully portray the subtleties of Indian society and culture.  These stories superficially appear simple but have a deeper meaning.  I have enjoyed and repeatedly seen all thirteen episodes in this set but in particular have found four episodes to stand out as a must-see for anyone remotely interested in Indian culture.  They are ""The Missing Mail"", ""The Seventh House"", ""The Watchman"" and the ""Cat Within"".  I would not want to give away the stories of these episodes and rob the dear reader of some quality television but want to state that each reflects Narayan's deeper understanding and impression of the human mind.  I recommend this set highly to anyone who wants to watch quality television at its best!",1198713600,6,1873,5.101639344262295
8103556,3,B000E0P2MW,"I had seen a couple of episodes on TV in India as a kid. This is an earnest attempt to bring RK Narayan's work to life, that said, it falls short. RK Narayan paints a very colorful world with words, rich, colorful, bustling with activity. This might just do it for a kid, but as you grow older, your expectations change, and the bar is raised higher. This may well be the best thing with the given resrouces, but I enjoyed reading the books more than the dvd. The other thing that stuck me was that though RK Narayan's books are in English, they are very much Indian in thought, but this DVD is in English and it is missing that Indian spirit, unlike the books which opens you to the rich colorful Indian culture, soceity etc, If you saw this as a kid, chances are you may not enjoy it as an adult.",1174435200,,798,4.188311688311688
8103557,5,B000E0P2MW,"If you had seen Malgudi days as a child on doordarshan, you will surely relive those memories again, if you watch this DVD.

Very worth gift for someone.",1173312000,,153,4.464285714285714
8103558,5,B000E0P2MW,"I watched this series on Doordarshan when it was originally telecast and was mesmerized by the simplicity of the characters and the excellent picturization.  The DVD set is a wish come true, I can't wait to see it again.",1155513600,,220,4.641025641025641
8103559,3,B000E0P2MW,"If you are reading this, you probably loved the serial 'Malgudi days' on good old Doordarshan and want to know how endearing it still is. Or you love the books and want to check how they are adapted to the celluloid.

The good news is that the episodes still look good and fresh. Admittedly, the repeat value for some of the episodes (which is an important consideration when you buy a dvd) is non-existent so this is something you would want to factor in your decision to buy. Some of the stories seem simplistic but that is a trait of RKN's writing (and is probably a tribute to small-town life - you do not have to complicate something that is inherently simple).

The DVD itself is packaged well and there is a neat booklet that serves as a guide for each episode. There are no other extras but since when did DVD's from India incorporate them? Still, it would have been nice if some commentary or critique were included given the popularity of Malgudi.

If you are remotely interested in the world of Malgudi, then this is a worthy buy and a fine way to indulge in nostalgia of tiled houses, elephants on roads and the easy pace of life in a bygone era of South India. Just don't expect anything earth-shattering though. IMO, Vaidyanathan's title music itself is worth the price of admission - Tanana-tanananana.",1138233600,23,1317,4.572033898305085
