8616386,4,B000007NUR,"This video is absolutely stunning. I love the raw worship experience that is captured at a church in London with Darlene. She is away from all the Hillsong worship team, so the songs are very differently arranged, however, I really prefer some of the British arrangements to these now Hillsong classics. A must have for your Darlene Zschech or Hillsong collection!",1282608000,,364,4.983606557377049
8616387,5,B000007NUR,"I have several of Hillsong's cd's. I absolutely LOVE your music. It is literally all I listen to. However, I hope that soon you put out a cd that features the solo singing of Darlene, as in the  ""I Believe The Promise""  release.  To hear her singing solo brings such awsome blessings to me, (and, I know, to many of my friends as well).  We wait in anticipation for a realease of more or her solo singing.  Thank you so very much.  God Bless you all, for blessing us with your music.
In The Lord, Karen M. Reimann",976665600,2,513,4.183673469387755
