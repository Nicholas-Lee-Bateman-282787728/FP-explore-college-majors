8205060,3,B000SAPJGM,"The previous reviews are polarized, and the truth is somewhere in the middle.  This DVD does provide a good basic introduction to what a track day involves, which is useful for someone contemplating doing one.  But yes, the information is rudimentary, and you'll outgrow this DVD after having done one or a few track days.  And yes, there's some promotional material in the DVD, but you can ignore it and it doesn't take up much time.  For those looking for more in-depth information on track driving (and racing), the ""Going Faster"" DVD from the Skip Barber group is certainly better (and really the only option currently available).",1384905600,,634,4.897196261682243
8205061,1,B000SAPJGM,"Save your money, this DVD only covers very basic things at a very high level and is more like a sales brochure than an actual instructional video. You are better off reading ""Speed Secrets"" or ""Going Faster (Skip Barber book)"". Most of the content is also freely available to watch on the HookedOnDriving website. Save your money for more seat time at track days with the instructors where you will learn a whole lot more.",1286323200,,422,4.64
8205062,5,B000SAPJGM,"Hooked On Driving offers beginners to performance driving an excellent source of ""how to"" information. I don't agree with the negative reviewer; the material is virtually unknown to the average driver... this is info covered by all professional performance drivers schools: Skip Barber for example, will cover this exact material in all of their beginner classes.",1269993600,,363,5.5
8205063,1,B000SAPJGM,"I had high hopes based on the description and the previous review.  What a complete waste of my money and my time.  There was absolutely no information in here that an average automotive racing fan wouldn't already know.  I suppose for a completely new driver there's some redeeming value, but if you're over age 16 forget it.  My favorite part was the five-minute explanation of the importance of fuel quality by a Shell representative (the title sponsor).  Wow, thanks, that will really help me at my next track day!  Add to that the gratuitous shots every few minutes of a Shell tanker truck parked near the racetrack, and you get the idea.  Save yourself the aggravation and the expense.  Don't buy this DVD.",1207526400,8,712,4.7317073170731705
8205064,5,B000SAPJGM,"Much more info than I expected.  Very well done and hey I can actually understand what they are explaining!  Loved it.  Heal and Toe driving watch out, I'm on the road baby.",1184284800,2,173,4.34375
