8093581,3,B000BWQTUM,"Absolutely loved the drama.  However, couldn't read ""white"" subtitles when words were shown against white doctor's coat, or light background.",1314748800,2,141,6.05
8093582,3,B000BWQTUM,"I ordered this drama from Amazon in February 2006--however the seller was different from the one now listed, so this review does not apply to the current seller.

The drama I received came in packaging different from what is currently shown.  The title printed on the box is ""Spring Sun,"" with a sticker that says ""Spring Days."" The E-subs (English subs) were listed as being excellent.  The product I received has good quality picture and sound, but the subs are so bad that 90% of the dialog is not comprehensible.

The translator clearly did not have even a basic knowledge of or fluency in English, appearing to have sat with dictionary in hand, translating literally word by word. There are many typos; personal pronouns are way off.  The translator literally translates the Korean honorific pronoun protocol, making it really impossible for any English-speaking person to comprehend and follow.  Fortunately, I am familiar with it and it finally dawned on me what the translator was doing, bringing a tiny bit of clarity to who is saying what about whom. The overall result is dialog that makes no sense, whatsoever.

The box set was sealed, however the CDs were slipped in nothing more than non-stick saran wrap-type plastic and thrown in the box.  On the whole, the particular box set I received reminds me of a cheap pirated version from Hong Kong.

My advice is to check with the distributor before purchasing.

As for the drama itself, I basically like the drama and would purchase it again--except for these blasted e-subs in my copy.  I found the acting to range from excellent to amateur, with several very accomplished veteran actors in the cast.  The performance by the actor playing the younger brother borders on laughable in this role, almost as though it's a tongue-in-cheek comedy.  (Unfortunately, it isn't.)

Rating:  Drama - 3 stars; E-subs - minus 1

Word to the wise:  Check out the seller and contact them regarding the quality of Eng subs before purchase!",1142985600,9,1983,4.889221556886228
8093583,3,B000BWQTUM,"This could have been a very good story. Unfortunately, Ji Jin-Hee was the only actor carrying this drama. The portrayal by Go Hyun-Jung and Jo In-Sung tried to take over the story. They were really not very believable. They were too immature and childish. The actor who played the young doctor should have been left to play a band player--that would have been more believable. Unfortunately the director decided to give them more of a focus than necessary. So, so disappointing.

Ji Jin-Hee is a fantastic actor and had his character been developed to be the main focus, it would have been a much better story. I would give Ji Jin-Hee 5 stars, but because of the other 2 actors, I couldn't. Disappointing.",1139356800,5,705,4.7317073170731705
