This documentary goes backstage and behind the scenes in a way I found really interesting, interviewing the coffeeshop owners, seed company guys, growers, expert pot judges, and the staff of High Times magazine.

It's not too long, and well done, so if you're interested in cannabis, Amsterdam, and the event, check it out!",1235088000,4,399,4.940298507462686
8285051,4,B001BWYT44,"This edition of the High Times Cannabis Cup DVD is much more of a documentary style video than the one made in 2003 which contained a lot of strange outtakes.  The overall quality is also much better and this is a very well made and entertaining video as well.  Good commentary from the select cast about the behind the scenes of the event and about some of the culture of Amsterdam, as well as some stories of their experiences in the city during their visit.  It goes inside the coffee shops, gets into some of the politics of the event and gives a good in depth look at how it all works.  Overall a really well made film and would definitely reccomend.",1234396800,6,655,4.344262295081967
