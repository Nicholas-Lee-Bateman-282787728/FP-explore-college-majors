6031503,5,B00FUABJQY,"A fun, campy little experience that does pretty great at capturing the feel of Eisner's works. Not a faithful adaptation of The Spirit's origin story, but it's own little thing that really does the character justice. The acting's quality varies, but Ellen and The Spirit are both wonderfully done by their respective actors, the only really awful moment is the very beginning, where a death scene is painfully over done. The DVD looks pretty great considering it's an archive edition. If you like the old comics or Darwyn Cooke's reboot, this is good for you.",1428364800,,559,4.894736842105263

6031505,2,B00FUABJQY,"My husband and I enjoy ""B"" flicks and have a very nice library.  This film is more of a ""C"" flick, uneven and weak.",1422316800,,115,3.7916666666666665
6031506,4,B00FUABJQY,"It's 80's slightly, (okay maybe more than slightly), cheesy super hero fun.
This was meant as TV Movie pilot for a potential series.
It was not picked up.
Perhaps it would have fared better in today's TV environment with more tan the basic broadcast network options.

Silly but fun, this is head and shoulders above the more recent cinematic attempt at the character.
Recommended.",1420070400,2,380,4.9375
6031507,4,B00FUABJQY,"The film sticks close to the original newspaper strips and comic books, unlike the 2008 turkey. The only problem is that it was too expensive for a 1986 film. It would have been a good buy at half the price.",1389398400,3,207,4.2
6031508,3,B00FUABJQY,"This ""Archive Collection"" (burn-on-demand) DVD-R of 1987's made-for-TV adaptation of ""The Spirit""---actually a 64-minute pilot episode that never got picked up---is good for a watch, especially if you've got a soft spot for 1980's camp and light-hearted crime fighting.  Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) does a capable job in the lead: there are definitely some fundamental flaws (limited set design, for example), but the action is decent and several of the supporting characters are interesting or at least memorable.  It's not exactly a hidden gem, but I've definitely seen much worse in the world of failed TV pilots.

The DVD-R itself is pretty limited, though.  The source material (edited on videotape, it would seem) is hardly impressive and no efforts were made to remaster it.  There are NO bonus features.  Heck, there's barely even a menu screen!  It's definitely overpriced at $20 or more and would probably have been better suited as a $5-$10 digital download.  Only die-hard fans of the character---especially those who have seen this 1987 adaptation before---should buy it sight unseen.  It's great that obscure productions like this are being made available, but there's very little ""bang for your buck"" here.",1383264000,11,1218,5.269430051813472
6031509,4,B00FUABJQY,"Warner Archive continues its crusade to give fans of quirky classic television shows and movies of yesteryear what they want on-demand with the release of 1987's ""The Spirit."" Originally made as a pilot for a series based on Will Eisner's legendary comic book character, it ended up forever lost as a TV-movie. It wasn't until the arrival of Frank Miller's ill-received big-screen adaptation that this garnered attention once again.

Denny Colt (Sam Jones) comes to Central City to investigate the death of his good friend (Philip Baker Hall). After getting a little too close to the truth, Colt is shot and left for dead to drown in the harbor. Thought to be dead, he ""raises"" from the grave as the masked avenger the Spirit. He joins forces with the city's police commissioner Dolan (Garry Walberg) to find the connections between his friend's murder and a local art heist.

The Warner Archive release of ""The Spirit"" marks the first time it's been made available in any home entertainment format. It's printed on-demand and only available on DVD. In essence, what you're getting is a legally burned copy of the movie. Like the cover states, ""It's expected to play back in DVD Video 'play only' devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives."" Has it been digitally remastered and cleaned up to the best of Warner's abilities? No, but I guarantee the picture and audio quality is better than any of the bootlegs or YouTube versions floating around out there.

The cast of ""The Spirit"" features some interesting actors in key roles. Sam Jones steps out of his Flash Gordon outfit and into the blue suit and fedora of the masked vigilante. Nana Visitor (""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" ""Torchwood"") plays police commissioner Dolan's daughter, Ellen, who has a crush on the Spirit. Television actor Garry Walberg of ""Quincy, M.E."" fame portrays Commissioner Dolan.

Most fans of ""The Spirit"" will find this failed 1987 TV-pilot much easier to digest than Frank Miller's big-screen adaptation of the hero. Although the movie has its ups and downs, it's more accurate to the tone and visual appearance of Will Eisner's beloved comic book. It's a worthy addition for any enthusiast looking to complete their home entertainment library of super hero films.",1382400000,14,2284,4.971204188481676
8618657,5,B00FUABJQY,This was sooo much better than the Frank Miller 2008 fiasco. Also has a young Nana Visitor in it cica 1987 for any DS-9 fans. The casting and feel of the film was so much more in line with the comics that Will Eisner made legend.,1499644800,,229,4.0
8618658,4,B00FUABJQY,Cheesy action with a sense of humor.  I enjoyed watching it as it's a fun movie.  Also fun to see Nana Visitor in her role.  It's not Shakespeare but it is a very entertaining made for TV movie.  Glad I purchased.,1491350400,,213,4.121951219512195
8618659,4,B00FUABJQY,"I remedy watching this when I was a kid, and wished they had made this into a series. It had a sense of fun to it, and it reminded me of being a kid and watching the Lone Ranger with my Father. I got to meet Sam Jones not too long ago, and you could tellyhow much fun he had. Outland it came out on DVD. It is much better than that movie from about 2006.",1490400000,,354,3.6710526315789473

8618661,4,B00FUABJQY,"The Spirit is a tv made adaptation of one of the greatest comic book series of all time, Will Eisner's The Spirit! This 1987 offering is charming at best and cringe worthy at times. The hearts are in the right place though because they successfully adapt The Spirit's origin and, while the plot may be thin and the budget painfully low, the characterization is great! This is worth at least a watch for ALL comic book fans and especially fans of The Spirit.",1484870400,,457,4.518072289156627
8618662,5,B00FUABJQY,"Surprisingly entertaining, puts the expensive 2008 version to shame.",1475366400,,68,6.666666666666667
8618663,5,B00FUABJQY,"I had to pick this one up, because my VHS copy went kaput! As other reviewers have stated, this incarnation of Eisner's ""The Spirit"" is way better than the 2008 motion picture. The cover photo is misleading, because Sam Jones' hat and suit are royal blue, the same color as used in the comics. The style is a mish-mash of retro and current; old cars, vintage clothes, modern people and soundtrack music. Yes, the script is cheesy, but it reflects the innocence of the times when ""The Spirit"" had its original run.  You may remember Sam Jones as the actor in the film, ""Flash Gordon"", and the spunky kid, ""Eubie"" (Ebony in the comics) is Bumper Robinson, who as an adult now is the voice of the Falcon and Cyborg and Black Lightning in various animated cartoons. Again, I highly recommend this, if not for the quality of the film, or to fulfill your superhero film collection, then get it to show publishers there is a demand for obscure movies.",1456963200,,944,4.552941176470588
8618664,4,B00FUABJQY,"Too bad this was never made into a series. As campy and stupid as it is, I saw this one on TV in the 80's and since I was a real honest to god fan of the Will Eisner comics, I liked it a lot, even though the producers changed Ebony's name! And when the movie came out a few years ago... Well, I still cannot bring myself to even rent the DVD. At least someone tried to make a nice representation of the comic in this case and in some weird way it does a pretty good job.",1451260800,,470,3.757575757575758
8618665,4,B00FUABJQY,"Not quite the comic book character that I remember, but give it an ""E"" for Effort.  The best that I can say is Cheesy!",1448668800,,118,3.9166666666666665
8618666,4,B00FUABJQY,"Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) as Denny Colt, the cop who loses his life only to begin a new one as The Spirit! A fun tv adaptation of Will Eisner's phenomenal crime fighter. The Spirit with beautiful Ellan Dolan at his side (Nana Visitor) cracks a crime ring of art forgers led by the femme fatale P'Gell! Action with a sprinkling of laughs, a worthy edition to your crime fighting film collection!",1437091200,,393,4.549295774647887
