1800202,5,B0000714BS,"This poignant, exciting, realistic tale of human iniquity and eventual spiritual resurrection evokes, and is mostly equal to, ""Once Upon A Time in America"". Olmos' directing and acting are both brilliant; in a genre where there's a strong temptation for the actors to ham it up with gang signs and baggy pants, he has inspired real sincerity and genuine emotion. Never for a moment do any of the protagonists seem like they are trying to act cool; it's entirely convincing. The voiceovers - You Ride, Behind Pride, Thinking you can hide; the music - the killing of one of Santana's own accompanied by the desperate ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""; the wealth of expression on the actors' faces - as when Santana learns his mother has died; all add up to create an extraordinary atmosphere. Colors, light, shadows are all beautifully arranged; an especially effective scene being when La Eme and Nuestra Familia file into the prison's cinema, their light and dark blue shirts the only colors. Superb performances by JD, Mundo, Puppet, Little Puppet, Cary; sorry, I don't know all their real names, but they are to be congratulated. Make sure you wait for the closing credits to hear ""Ain't No Sunshine"".",1120694400,17,1202,4.926108374384237
1800203,5,B0000714BS,"this was a really good movie. if u buy tha dvd it has a documentary ""lives in hazard"" which in my opinion was as good as tha movie.",1119916800,3,131,3.7142857142857144
1800204,5,B0000714BS,"The movie is a valiant effort but everything is so negative its hard to have any compassion for anybody. There is an incredible documentary ""Lives In Hazard"" in the bonus section that tells the story of the making of the movie. They interview real-life gang members and convicts in Folsom. The technical advisor for this movie (a former gang member) was murdered in her own driveway after the movie was made.",1111622400,2,408,4.76056338028169
1800205,5,B0000714BS,"This is the most brilliant film I have seen about East Los Angeles.  It's about consequences which follow action, and about those victims that fall between them.  It's about the true struggle that Mexican-Americans face in the Barrio and about the air of violence and hatred that these children grow up in.  Violence conceives violence, and creates a cyclical conundrum in which escape is futile.  I see that the Editorial Reviewer on this page wanted to see a solution to our problem.  Well miss O'Gorman, if we could find a solution, trust me, we would fix it.  As for now, things stay as it is (to some extent) portrayed on the film.  The film uses juxtapositions of scenes of love with scenes of violence and creates an aesthetic captured only by great story tellers (such as Tolstoy which you see the main character reading in the film).  This film is beautiful and Olmo's life's work.  A must see for those interested in ELA culture.",1057363200,16,939,4.676829268292683
1800206,5,B0000714BS,This is the best movie l have ever seen Olmos throws it down for la Raza about our struggle at the time I cant say this was bad it was interesting to watch and understand our culture at the time. Olmos should do a another of these movies again.,1052179200,8,244,4.0
1800207,5,B0000714BS,"This movie captures the real gang banging life within the walls of prison.  Folsum Prison is accurte in all the scenes.  What is most chillinging is the values that are so intense in the prison system.  Never show weakness, ride behind pride and violence without  thought are tools for survivial.  I highly recommend ""Blood in Blood Out"" to compliment the California Depatment of Corrections life style.",1052092800,4,403,5.045454545454546

It seemed like the institutions put a coat on him with a persona and he had no choice but to wear that coat and do what he had to to survive.. And  when he was released he didn't know how to act like a normal person His shyness with women, feeling like he didn't belong to either world, and hating the one he knew he was going back to because he had changed and knew the man he had become could no longer survive in prison.

1800714,4,B0000714BS,"We've seen this sort of thing before. Gangsters in and out of the joint. Running their empire from within and without. Struggling to maintain their power. This is the first one I recall dealing with the Latinos in East L.A.

Here's the scoop. The film begins with the Zoot Suit riots in L.A. after WWII. The riot introduces us to the mother and father of Santana Montoyo. Shoot ahead a few years and we meet Santana (Edward James Olmos) as a teenager on the rise with a gang. He gets into some trouble and lands in the joint where he solidifies his power both inside and outside of prison. After 18 years he's set free and life outside proves to be fraught with its own challenges.

This is a decent movie. It's Olmos' directing debut for a feature length film. Probably the best angle here is when Satana is released from prison. Here is a man who has done much to maintain a high degree of power and respect but, since his formative years have been spent inside prison, he is socially very awkward when he hits the real world. He meets a local gal and is simply at odds as to how to be with her, have normal sex and a normal relationship. They say, when trying to profile a serial killer, you can nail down much about him except when it comes to his age. Because if he's done time, his social clock has stopped, and that is what's happening here. He tries to adjust with a calm assuredness but his view of things is too skewed. Much of the rest of the story deals with his struggle to maintain his empire. Not really much new there.

Some of the script and directing are a bit heavy handed and the pace gets a bit uneven in parts, but, overall, this is a good entry into the genre. The soundtrack is cool. Olmos does a good job in his role as does William Forsythe as Santana's buddy J.D. If you at all like Gang/prison dramas you could do much worse.",1387756800,,1853,4.273504273504273

Once in a gang, one never gets out of the gang, even after release from prison.

1800730,5,B0000714BS,"This is a powerful movie, perhaps made more powerful when viewed in combination with the behind-the-scenes documentary that comes on the Blu-ray disk.  Besides showing how some LA gangs were brought  to a truce to aid in producing American Me, the documentary notes that during or shortly after the shooting of the film, some of the gang members enlisted as extras were shot down, as well as the lady, a former gang member, whose adult life had been spent in the barrio trying to mediate among the gangs.  She had appeared in a small role in the film.  In other words, a temporary truce doesn't slow down business as usual in the east LA barrio.

Another point brought home by the documentary is that kids reared in the barrio literally cannot see far enough to glimpse a life other than that ruled by gang culture.  They are born into families whose other members are or were active gang members, and every street they pass down, every school they attend, every business establishment they visit, every person they see is connected with or influenced by the gangs.  Their gang becomes their religion in a way that effectively makes them citizens of a nation other than the United States.  And like many other visitors, they are largely unprepared to enter U.S. society in a productive way.  Unfortunately, all this is not found only in east Los Angeles.",1367193600,,1354,4.727659574468085
1800731,4,B0000714BS,"This is a very powerful and strong film that will for sure stay with you. Though it met with basically only mixed reviews upon its release, for me it has been one I had to add to my ""gangster"" film library.  Some of the scenes are especially potent.  It is all based in or at least loosely based in the historical facts surrounding the creation of the modern-day prison gang known as ""La Eme"" or also ""Mexican Mafia"".  This gang is predominantly found in California and Southwestern US prisons, but it reaches out to the streets as well and doubtless to varying extents across the border into Mexico with some of the drug-dealing activities and so forth.

 The real Eme members who saw the film were apparently infuriated that Olmos had portrayed firstly their founder as having been raped in a juvenile hall (even though in the film he then kills the attacker), and secondly some of their members sexually assaulting another male inmate at one point later in the film.  As well as the intimation or depiction in the film that the founding member, or one of the founders, was later killed by his own gang members.  To the actual Eme prison gang members these portrayals were seen as highly disrespectful and insulting, to say the least, and Olmos himself was supposedly actually ""green-lighted"" (ok'd to be ""hit"") by these men on the streets. At least two of the film's ""consultants"" actually were killed.  Olmos had to hire bodyguards, etc, and probably lived looking over his shoulder for some time.  Not to mention he was also supposedly sued believe it or not by ""Pegleg"" Joe Morgan (the real-life white co-founder or early member of the gang who was portrayed in the film by William Forsythe) who sued Olmos and company for half a million dollars from his cell at Pelican Bay, claiming they had depicted his life story without his permission.  So needless to say, while much of it was fictional or ""poetic license"" was probably taken with some of the facts, a good deal of the material here also definitely overlapped with real events.

 It's definitely worth watching or adding to your collection, particularly for those who are fans of the gangster-type genre and/or prison films, or nowadays prison documentary as well (such as ""Lockup"", ""Hard Time"", etc). Bearing in mind once more that some of the prison material depicted in this film could be disturbing to younger or more sensitive viewers.  There is a very brutal (probably fictional) scene where the rather dimwitted son of a powerful Italian gangster is assaulted and killed in the penitentiary... to which the young man's father then retaliates by poisoning the East LA heroin supply causing many overdoses and deaths in the Mexican community.  But the scene itself may disturb some viewers, along with some of the drug use and overdose depictions and so forth.

 It's a very gritty movie that doesn't compromise, and it displays this unique subculture pretty much exactly as it must have been at that time (that is, the Chicano/ Mexican-American ""cholo""-type subculture in California and the Southwest from the 1940's all the way to the 1980's).  There is also at least one important plot-related twist (again, quite possibly fictional) relating to the character who is based upon the Eme founder which will probably leave you surprised as well.  Today that founder is gone, but the Eme remains a serious force to be reckoned with, still based in the west coast penal system.  Nowadays they are allied, at least within the prisons, with other very powerful prison gangs that also have the ability to reach beyond the walls such as the Aryan Brotherhood (a ""business""-based alliance one has to assume), and they also control or have a hand in several of the large youth-based Hispanic LA street gangs.  ""Santana"" and his small crew, or rather the real men upon whom these characters were based, certainly grew into something they might not have even been able to imagine back then and something that remains a serious and heavy presence on the scene still today.",1367193600,,4029,4.845481049562682

""American Me"" is filled with inaccurate information about the Mexican Mafia, and according to ""Boxer"", a dropped out member of this organized crime prison institution, three people were ""wacked"" by EME because of insulting and embellished story telling on the part of Edward James Olmos.

I highly recommend any student of law enforcement, in particular, Corrections Officer candidates, to purchase this film as well as read the book ""The Black Hand"", a prose written about the impact of the Mexican Mafia in this generation.

It's unfortunate tha these three deaths occured due to ""story"" telling, but most likely these individuals would have died by the sword anyway due to the fact they were still active gang members.

He immediately hooks up with his gang cronies looking to expand La Eme business (Forsythe is especially memorable as J.D., based on real-life former LE member Joe ""Peg Leg"" Morgan) and even falls for a woman along the way. It isn't long before Santana realizes that he will most likely never get adjusted to society and live a normal life.

1800768,5,B0000714BS,"While this is one of my favorite movies, there were many scenes in it that bothered me.  I was very pleased to finally see a good movie about Chicanos growing up in America.  It's easy to look at these characters and call them stupid.  However, one must keep in mind that they grew up in a place where they and their parents were hated because of their skin color.  No, it doesn't justify joining a gang and selling drugs.  But in the end, who is more wrong?

Santana's parents were zoot suiters.  I'm willing to bet a lot of people who watched this movie didn't even know what really happened to zoot suiters in those days (not that I'm saying this movie is a history book).  I also realize there are always at least two sides to a story.  But anyway, the so called ""zoot suit riots"" were about the ""heroic"" sailors beating these zoot suiters up (many of them were only kids) and putting them ""in their place"".  The cops were ""most helpful"" and arrested them (zoot suiters) after they were beaten.

Time passes, but little changes.  Children were born to them and grew up poor, without hope and with lots of anger.  What are they to do?  No, they are not victims, but they are also not stupid kids who chose a life of crime when they had so much going for them.  What did they have going for them?

Santana, Mundo, and JD end up in juvie and eventually prison.  They formed one of most powerful prison gangs known as ""La Eme"".  In their mind, they are a success story.  They are doing what think is right for their people.  They are protecting their people in prison and controlling the drug trade that already existed.

Santana eventually meets a woman who he takes an interest in.  It is through her that he realizes he is two people.  One is the one she loves.  He's the innocent one who is like a child and knows little about the outside world.  The other is evil and is the head of a powerful gang.  And a certain point in the movie, Santana feels there is no hope for him.  He's all grown up now and knows nothing more than his life in prison.  He even realizes he's not 100% Chicano.

I would have liked this movie more than Scarface and The Godfather if it weren't for some VERY disturbing scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I realize this is a prison movie.  However, IMO, there were a few things this movie should have cut out or shortened.  The rape scenes (there were at least 3) were MUCH, MUCH longer than necessary.

I think Santana summed this movie up best when he said the following: ""You know, a long time ago, two best homeboys, two kids, were thrown into juvie.  They were scared, and they thought they had to do something to prove themselves.  And they did what they had to do.  They thought they were doing it to gain respect for their people, to show the world that no one could take their class from them.  No one had to take it from us, ese.  Whatever we had...we gave it away...""",1252195200,5,2901,4.303703703703704

1800770,1,B0000714BS,"American Me: 3/10: In all fairness I have to admit I was expecting more of a gang picture (albeit a serious one) with Mexican overtones rather than a straightforward prison drama.

American Me is a straightforward prison drama.

Nobody in this film emotes; and pass the K-Y jelly because there is more guy on guy action in this movie than in the men's room at a Sex in the City wrap party. Add in the bathroom/drug smuggling scenes and you may be squirming in your seat for more reasons than a slow pace.

In addition, many older actors can play characters in their twenties. Even those that have obvious hairline issues (see the later Porky's movies) seem to pull it off. Edward James Olmos is one man who should never even try. He looks like he was born fifty. He also plays the lead with the charisma of a sullen rock.

In addition to the miscasting and sodomy, American Me suffers from serious script issues. It simply takes at face value the characters contention that they are king of the world. They are not. It is one thing for the characters themselves to be misguided (as they are most certainly are) but the movie itself seems not to realize what big losers these guys are. Sure, they are king of the cellblock. Hurrah, that is like being voted carnie of the month.

A good first 45 minutes or so quickly melts into under acted pathos (Nobody emotes in this movie, cause they are all tough guys see.) and misguided plot twists (the whole taking on the mob bit was horribly done). The movie just keeps getting worse and worse.

Oh and Olmos's character writes poetry; bad rhyming poetry. Yup poetry and anal sex, American Me is one makeover away from its own Bravo series.",1248825600,3,1682,4.516447368421052

1800781,5,B0000714BS,"American Me (1992), is an uncommonly  absorbing, introspective
movie, not so much dealing with gangs, as dealing with the subject
of one's own identity in face of other individuals, other groups,
other cliques. At length,  creating or joining a clique or gang
may facilitate or solve the problem of  seeking  one's own
identity, purpose in life, and place in society at large.

Clearly, to a lesser or greater degree, viewers will relate to
peer-pressure scenarios, whether as part of the military, working
for a company, an association, a community organization, etc.

Edward James Olmos, plays the leader of the eMe, spotlessly
portraying the leader who is highly sensitive and aware of what
constitutes leadership, which is the importance in creating,
maintaining a particular image for success in the clique, which is
to say in controlling perceptions at large, to command as well the
respect of rival group members.

He is great at this, having graduated to the boss position from a
""professional"" track record, extending  from youth to adulthood,
always with the same particular type of people or members
comprising his organization, or those of rivals.

William Forsythe, (also seen in Gotti, for example) has an equally
fascinating appearance  throughout the movie, as a no-nonsense
gangster.

The cinematography is impeccable, as is the case with the sound,
and musical accompaniment or soundtrack, with subtitles and a true
wide-screen.

There is a fair bit of gang jargon throughout, despite the
subtitles will  mystify viewers.

There are a few eyebrow raisers, such as the thousands of junkies
scattered across cities, that rely on the toxicity of the
substance they consume, or the horrific scenes.

In gangs or cliques, nobody is above the clan's or clique's
commandments, including the top dog, as the disciplined members
are pigeon-holed into a lifestyle (they often know of no other)
and as such, become dependent professionals in both behavior and
conduct after a period of time -  their reactions to any deviance
being mechanical, and automatic. This upbringing and lifestyle, or
belief system, can be larger than life, larger than what humans
sometimes  can control themselves.

The gang aspect, from an educational point of view, is perhaps
overdone, by specifically underlining rival factions, of La
Primera St., 18th St, Hazard, Nuestra Familia, the Whites, the
Blacks, Italians.

There is also a litany of detention centers listed, such as
Folsom, Chino, Soledad, Vacaville, etc. The business motives are
clearly explained,  from extortion, sex, gambling, substances.

Perhaps the downfall of a leader is being out of touch with
members, either for love, passion, lack of experience in dealing
with distractions, resulting in a shaky adherence to  gang
commandments.

A strenth  of the movie, is the historical accuracy and concern
for an entire community in face of other  communities that were
well established in USA, the resulting tensions and the challenges
for acceptance.

It also is highly original and brave in not shying away from
showing the ugly reality as it is.

The movie is perhaps too specific, in demonstrating the inmate
lifestyle in various aspects.",1238198400,4,3194,5.260869565217392

Frankly, it's not for the squeamish or overly sensitive crowd. With that being said, it's a typical prison drama. You pretty much have the usual rape, death by shankings, and rioting scenes. To this day, I have never seen a prison movie that ended on a good note, and I certainly can't remember anything good about this one either. This movie was just sad and depressing from start to finish. Edward James Olmos plays a youth who's life is a downward spiral soon as he's sent to a youth detention center. Of course, he's raped there by another male youth (which he kills). From there, he gains respect, but he also gains a sure ticket into prison as soon as he turns 18. This movie is sad because even after he gets out of prison he can't seem to make it on the outside or blend into society because he's been locked away for so long, and he still has that prison mentality. Ultimately that leads to his demise. That's pretty much what this movie is about..nothing real impressive! I do think what pushes it over the edge is the brutality of the rape scenes. I must admit watching a man being tied down and gang raped by 4 inmates was enough to haunt me for a while. Especially, the fact that they were sick enough to enjoy this at the same time, and be so kind as to use KY Jelly first. What happens after that I won't even mention. This movie is not for kids at all. However, I do suggest that it be shown to all teens and pre-teens who think their so tough, and that jail is a place they truely want to be.

I don't know which one i love more out of the two, because i know i've watched each movie more then 30 times... Both movies are pretty similar to each other... but ""Blood In, Blood Out"" kinda focuses on the 3 brothers, and the paths each of them takes, where as ""American Me"" focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie (like Santana, Puppet, Lil' Puppet, etc).. but not only does it show their lifestyles, but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families, and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading... ""American Me"" i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture (La Raza) then ""Blood In, Blood Out"" does... it also shows its origin, like the Pachuco's (Zoot Suit's, Zoot Suit riots).. This movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book... To me i think it definitely is 1/2 star better then ""Blood In, Blood Out""...becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it, and more characters its focusing on... both in and outside the prison walls..

I am not a particular fan of this type of movie but if you watch ""Lock Down"" you'll see what a movie in this genre SHOULD BE.

After all I've heard about American Me I thought it would be good, it wasn't even decent... and the extras are laughable.",1136160000,4,516,4.5978260869565215
1800799,4,B0000714BS,"Edward James Olmos's movie ""American Me,"" is about the life of a boy named Santana. As a child he witnessed the harassment of his parents during the Zoot Suit Riots. He then joined the community gang and committed crimes with his two best friends. The three of them get sent to Juvenile Hall until they are old enough to go to jail. They go to Folsom Prison from there, and build up their gang. Soon they are the most feared people in the area. They controlled all the drug dealing and gambling in the prison. Though he does what he does with a certain enjoyment, he understands his life is the wrong life to lead. He fears his younger brother might end up just like him.

After many years, and even more killings, Santana's sentence comes to an end although his gang stays strong. After coming home he falls in love with a cousin of a friend. She falls for the childish side of him, not the drug dealing, killer he also is. She blames him for the deaths caused by drug overdoses.

The night of a friend's wedding he gets arrested for something he didn't do. He goes back to jail and lives there contemplating his life. Soon afterward members of an opposing gang kill him and dump his body. Meanwhile his younger brother joins the gang, and goes out to kill someone, starting the same life as Santana.

The movie follows the story line of a poem summarizing Santana's life. Lines like: ""It was easy to blame my father for everything I did, isn't that the life of every kid"" and ""Thought I knew it all, ended up in juvie hall"" really give a sense of his life as a child. The events of his father's life led to him being a gangster and going to jail.

""American Me"" shows a different side of California which someone normally wouldn't come across. It shows the underground world of gang violence and drug dealing. Events like those in the movie occur everyday, although most of them not to the public eye.

""American Me"" also shows jail life, and the different events of living behind bars. The movie acts as a passage way between the lives of you and me and the lives of others in our community. Others who were led to a life of crime and violence. Others who never escaped.

One question comes to mind while watching the movie; does a scarring childhood justify a life of crime?

It's very tough to change one's perspective on the world after it has been developed. In the case of a boy like Santana, he experienced brutal events occurring within his community, thus giving him a negative outlook on life. These experiences lead him to the life he lives. Although it would be tough to change the course of destiny once it begins, it still does not justify a life of killing. There are multiple roads a person can choose to follow, and Santana chose the wrong one.",1128816000,5,2763,4.437869822485207
1800800,5,B0000714BS,"Another view of gang life and it's effect on human relations, both in and out of prison. Even tho the violence is toned down from reality, it reflects a life that is very much a part of our society today. A society within a society. I like the fact that while the characters are caught up in this life, they don't make it look so glorious that young kids would be attracted to this life while viewing the movie.",1123632000,,411,4.215189873417722

7973960,5,B0000714BS,"This was a Four Star film in my opinion but the hour long documentary boosted it by half a Star. The beginning shows you how racist America was towards Mexican Americans. The so-called ""Greatest Generation"" was the most racist of generations. Seeing what airmen, marines, sailors and soldiers did to Mexican Americans during the Zoot Suit Riots sets my guts afire. It has me rethink the so-called ""honor"" of the American forces and their generation. thugs in uniforms is what they all were. They may have been no different than the Nazis & Fascists!

While this film subject matter had been covered before in other films it had never been detailed from the Mexican American point of view. Kudos to Mr. Edward James Olmos. He pulled things off very well. Janet Maslin said the film was dark, slow and solemn. Violent as it is, American Me is seldom dramatic enough to bring its material to life. She's right about that. However, the film does convey its message enough for the viewer  to learn about Mexican Barrios. Without being preachy or pedantic, Olmos's film pulls this off and shows us how the gangs in East L.A. are merciless--even to those within their ranks.

I look at this movie and realize that that could have been me coming up as a kid had I come up in the barrio. You gotta be tough in the 'hood because if you are not you will be considered a ""punk"" and any and everyone will walk all over you. This is where I realize how women have it so much easier than men. They never have to join gangs and there is never any pressure on them to be ""tough"". Machismo exists only for men.

Unfortunately for Santana he gains wisdom too late and is slain by members of his gang. Buy this film and you will like it. I want to recommend some other films like this. Colors, a Robert Duvall film discusses gangs in detail. The Warriors is another film that details gang life from the East Coast, however. As an extra, see the 21-Jumpstreet Episodes: Loc'd Out. It will show you the gangs Seattle style.

I'm the 277th person to Rate this fine film. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
