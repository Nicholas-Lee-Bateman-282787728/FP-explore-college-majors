5353810,5,B009NNMBCA,"Being a fan aside, I can't think of any major criticisms for this movie. It took the time to focus on each of the boys as well as the group as a whole. There was also excellent concert sequences and the quality was excellent. It came off as real and leaving the theater, I honestly felt like I understood them much better, and I felt closer to them and their music as a result.
The boys are incredible, and so was this movie.",1380499200,31,425,4.132530120481928
5353811,5,B009NNMBCA,I loved it but my hater of a mom said it was just concert videos.......I think it was mainly a concert for the fans that cant go to a concert so if you cant afford a $200 ticket then you should spend $6 on this movie,1380412800,27,216,3.717391304347826
5353812,5,B009NNMBCA,"I'm a 30 something year old directioner with no kids, and I loved this movie.  I found it really interesting to see how they first started and got to where they are today.  They are all very dedicated and their success is much deserved.",1379721600,75,236,4.340909090909091
5353813,5,B009NNMBCA,"I'm QUITE a bit older than the average fan, but thanks to having 2 younger daughters, i have become a HUGE fan of these boys! This movie is an awesome insight into the lives of these young men. It shows you the fun times, and the times when they are just openly and honestly still kids who miss their mums and dads and would love nothing more, some days, than to just be able to walk down the street without getting mobbed. But, accepting their place in the world and loving every minute, they pull it off with grace. They prove to be very humble, down to earth young men from solid working class families, who have worked SO very hard to get where they are. In the realm of boybands, the life expectancy of a group isn't very long. But i'd like to see these fellas stay together for a long time and keep up the amazing work. We love you One Direction!!!!",1378857600,83,855,4.219512195121951
5353814,5,B009NNMBCA,"First off, let me start by saying that I am not an obsessed teenage girl writing a review for One Direction. I happen to be much older but I really do love this group and I also fell in love with the movie. I think it was raw and real and it really gave you a look into what happens during their day whether they are working or have a day off. These young men are very talented and humble and also very different from the previous boy groups who have come before. Even if your not a huge fan you should see the movie and not judge because these boys deserve all the fame and success they have through their hard work and dedication.",1378252800,186,632,4.064
5353815,5,B009NNMBCA,"Being a huge directioner, I just had to drag my best friend who hates them out to see this with me and even she admitted that she liked it, which is saying a lot. This movie is everything a directioner could want and then some. I used to like Justin Bieber before he ruined his life and when the Never Say Never movie came out I loved it, but that's nothing in comparison to this. This movie was extremely enjoyable to me and I can't wait to buy the DVD.",1378166400,60,454,4.055555555555555
5353816,4,B009NNMBCA,"Even Martin Scorsese digs One Direction. In the most hilarious scene from One Direction: This Is Us, a 3D rockumentary about the world's biggest boy band, the director comes backstage to greet the lads before their debut at Madison Square Garden. ""I like your stuff,"" Scorsese says, shaking hands with all five U.K. crooners. Admittedly, Scorsese seems to be doing a tear-inducing favor for an accompanying girl (his granddaughter, perhaps), but he brings up a point that this film boldly illuminates: What's not to like? The quintet, made up of Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson, seems utterly unpretentious, with personalities as infectious as all those earworm-y singles. They harmonize wondrously on stage, singing tunes that are both energetic and respectful toward swarms of largely female fans, and off of it, they're each shown exuding appreciative glee, which, unlike the downtime in, say, Katy Perry: Part of Me, has nothing to do with preachy, puffed-up ideas about changing people's lives. That the movie is nearly as innocuous as the band's chart-toppers is bound to put a target on its back, goading cynics to dismiss it as frivolous bunk. But what makes the performers worth exploring is their truly anomalous nature.

Having each auditioned independently on Britain's The X-Factor in 2010, the boys, who range in age from 19 to 21, were eventually cobbled together as a group, a move for which Simon Cowell proudly takes credit in the film (""I made the decision in about 10 minutes,"" Cowell boasts, even though some sources claim the idea came from X-Factor guest judge Nicole Scherzinger). One Direction eventually lost the show's competition, but they signed with Cowell's Syco Records, and saw a rabid, rapidly formed fanbase rocket them to global fame before they'd even cut an album. Thanks in part to social media, the U.K. sensation soon hit the U.S., and in the movie, via an infographic that's typical for the film's director, Morgan Spurlock (who takes an uncharacteristic, low-profile approach to the job), we see the viral, worldwide spread on an animated map, which is soon covered with that ubiquitous ""1D"" logo. In the subsequent tour that This Is Us chronicles, the group bounces restlessly from France to Japan to Verona, each nation loaded with girls who all but convulse before the band in fits of joy. ""It's not unusual; it's unprecedented,"" notes a pundit, adding that not even the Beatles achieved this level of success so early in their careers.

Harry, Zayn, Niall, Liam, and Louis may not be the new John, Paul, George, and Ringo, but they all have remarkable singing chops. Unofficial frontman Harry stands out thanks to his especially impish rebellious streak and an inborn cool that promises he'll never be settling down from this life (the singer evokes Keith Richards long before he cites him as a hero). However, the bandmates otherwise seem to be on mostly equal footing. There's no spotlight-hogging Justin Timberlake here, nor does there seem to be a merely competent Nick Lachey, whose future will involve hosting shows that seek out the world's next One Directions. During the movie's breathless performance segments, all five guys are deftly engaging the crowd and the cameras, while the stage's video backdrops are brought to life via visual effects. At one point, the rock-inspired group belts out a cover of Wheatus's ""Teenage Dirtbag,"" while they're each depicted as anything but the song's title, intermittently adopting the CG qualities of a comic-book-ish set, and appearing as the superheroes so many imagine them to be.

But the boys genuinely don't seem to see themselves that way. Some of the film's most memorable moments involve Niall and Liam looking down on oceans of screaming devotees in the street, and controlling their cheers like orchestra conductors. It's not pomposity, as these kids are as shocked by the whopping spectacle as you are. And unlike Lindsay Lohan and Honey Boo Boo, the One Direction guys don't seem to have come from households with stage moms and dads. Their ostensibly blue-collar families are simply riding the wave with them, and the movie's poignancy comes from the bittersweet musings of the parents, who wrestle with empty-nest syndrome, the role-reversal of their children showing them the world, and the sheer surrealism of having a son achieve such monumental fame. Spurlock's chief mistake is that he seems to yank out confessional, kumbaya hogwash, underlining that which viewers can easily infer from the proceedings. The boys come off as being incapable of fakery, and their recreational antics more than speak for themselves, so the repeated insistence that they're ""just normal guys"" plays like a filmmaker's manipulative concession to genre clichs. Most glaring is a scene that's wholly out of context, wherein the band mates pitch tents and build a campfire, just so they can sit around it and discuss the future for the cameras. It's unabashedly staged, but then again, it visually highlights what Spurlock didn't need to spell out for anyone: that this movie captures a red-hot act at the peak of their glory, like it's holding onto a flame.",1378166400,4,5190,5.103529411764706

It had me rolling on the floor laughing...literally....and a right good many times too.  I love the way they show their families talking about them and their careers.  It shows that being famous is not all it's cracked up to be and that a strong foundation and base of support is ABSOLUTELY VITAL!! I love that they don't just make everything funny or sugar coat the whole way through, but instead show us that they have nerves, feelings, fears, and days where they miss home so much it makes them sick.  It really shows the truth behind fame.",1479340800,2,671,4.379032258064516
