5726736,4,B00CMG9P4M,"I was 8 when these came out in Japan, and getting to see them again, on DVD, was a real treat.  I have to resist the urge to go 5 stars out of nostalgia, I enjoyed them so much growing up.  It's two mini-features, 45 minutes each.  Only thing English is the subtitles, but I've never heard a dub of this series that I didn't hate.  The animation is a bit dated, but certainly not bad.  The stories are simple, and really don't follow the continuity of the series at all.  The only advantage to having watched the series at all is being familiar with the characters, as they really don't get any type of introduction.  If you enjoy anime of the more fantasy style, rather than the sci-fi style, Saint Seiya is a must.",1388361600,4,716,4.2592592592592595

5726738,5,B00CMG9P4M,"Saint Seiya is back! Remember when ADV stopped releasing Saint Seiya and got to volume 12, episode 60 back in 2005? Well fans were in uproar and while the episodes 1-60 have been re-released in collections and box sets, the later episodes were never released. This was deemed a combination of Saint Seiya not having the fanbase of South America and certain European countries like Italy, as well as just bad management such as licensing only half a show which makes it harder to renegotiate a good deal for the remaining.

Anyway luckily for fans, Discotek's (Eastern Star) have added Saint Seiya to it's now huge catalogue of classic shows. They have licensed all 4 of the original movies from the 80's which fit nicely into the TV series and give great side stories. I believe Discotek chose these movies as a way to gauge the plausibility of licensing the whole TV show, after all, they licensed Fist of the North Star movie first then the TV series when sales were deemed extremely good and sufficient.

Saint Seiya is very popular in Japan, one of their most successful franchises' ever. The continuation of further movies, video games and merchandise proves it, which is phenomenal for a show of 30 years of age. I highly recommend checking out the Playstation 3 game as well.

Both movies together are 90 minutes so around 45 minutes for each one. They are both in Anamorphic Widescreen and are remastered with the new telecline print used in Japan. The colors are riduclously vibrant and glossy. Infact the opening shots broadcast just how strong the animation will be throughout both productions. Newcomers do not need background knowledge to enjoy the show, the characters quickly grow on you and the Greek mythology is both exciting and easy to learn, you'll be surprised how edifying it can be with your new found knowledge.

An easy buy and addition to your anime library, it won't feel complete without this. Shonen fans in particular will appreciate the originality and the differences to other Toei masterpieces like Fist of the North Star and Dragon Ball Z. Perhaps Saint Seiya is the best of them all.

8583422,5,B00CMG9P4M,"great video quality.  Im surprised coming from a dvd format  thumbs  up for this edition.
Dont watch  this if you haven't  watch the first series of Saint seiya (sanctuary ).
it would be great if they would release  the whole series, every single  saga of Saint seiya. I would definitely  buy it. its a shame that this anime didn't  reach the English language  audience at all. like it did in Latin America,(including Brazil where it has a huge fanbase), italy, france and  the list goes on.
but anyways its really worthy to watch it all is my favorite anime series  ever.  I'm  happy with my purchase",1484784000,,601,4.547169811320755
