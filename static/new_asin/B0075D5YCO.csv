Cleese isn't doing stand up per se , but more of a one man show , part bio and all hilarious.  Sadly it's only available as an import so unless you have an all region player you should not order.  I have watched several times and never tire of his biting wit.",1431820800,,343,4.166666666666667
8510559,5,B0075D5YCO,"I saw Cleese perform this live in Modesto, CA at the Gallo Center for the Arts.  I believe it was the first time he performed this in the US.  Brilliant.  The first few minutes will have you doubled over on the floor, and the rest--though just as funny--is informative, too.

Cleese explores a lot of topics in short order.  He explores, of course, his divorce(s), schooling, family life, the beginnings of Python, and his relationship with Graham Chapman and the Python crew. He also presents clips from his early days demonstrating an unusually keen sense of timing and creativity.

Throughout Cleese's narration is distilled, dry, insightful, and amusing.

The entire performance is a joy.",1360195200,3,692,5.017543859649122
8510560,2,B0075D5YCO,"I came across this set while looking for something funny to watch on laughDB. The review wasn't encouraging, but I like John Cleese so I gave it a go. This DVD is really if you want to support John Cleese by buying something that will give him royalties. It is less a stand-up comedy show than an audio-visual presentation. I doubt there is much on it that will make you laugh.",1357948800,,377,4.323943661971831
