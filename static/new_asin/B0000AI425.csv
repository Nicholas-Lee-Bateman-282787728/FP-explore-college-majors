1906187,5,B0000AI425,I ordered this DVD because I have always loved the Nickelodeon nicktoons of the 90's and early 2000's and I've missed watching a lot of the shows especially since many of them aren't on anymore.  I especially miss watching a lot of the Christmas specials so I really enjoyed this DVD and it brought back a lot of memories of watching these when they were on TV.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone that loves the old shows that were on Nickelodeon.  I had no problems with the DVD and was happy with the way it was packaged and everything.  Therefore I give this a 5 star review.,1389484800,,582,4.3119266055045875

FROM THE BACK COVER:

Ho, ho, ho boy, Christmas never looked like this before! In these four merry tales, Santa's got his work cut out for him, trying to convince the non-believers that he really does exist... and convincing the believers that you CAN have too much of a good thing!

SpongeBob SquarePants ""Christmas Who?""
It's Bikini Bottom's first Christmas, and SpongeBob gets everyone into the spirit of the season. But when Santa doesn't show on Christmas morning, everyone is disappointed, especially SpongeBob. It's gonna take someone special to make SpongeBob feel jolly again. And you probably won't believe who that someone is!

Rugrats ""Babies In Toyland""
Stu's created a holiday village at Megacorp Park. On Christmas Eve, teh whole gang takes a trip to see the enchanted park with its lights, villages, real live elves and Santa himself! Unfortunately, Christmasland loses its sparkle when the adults become trapped inside a log cabin and Angelica drives Santa Claus to quit!

Nickelodeon Rocket Power ""A Rocket X-Mas""
Ray spots a classic 10-foot longboard in a local sport shop. But the price is too much for his wallet this holiday season. So Reggie and Otto decide to surprise him with it for Christmas! To make the cash they need, they start walking the neighborhood dogs. The job goes well, until Otto loses sight of some of his canine charges!

The Fairy OddParents ""Christmas Every Day""
Timmy loves Christmas so much, he wishes it could be Christmas every day! Big mistake. Santa is overworked and the other holidays are mad! So when the others want to banish Santa to make it stop, it's a race against time. Will Timmy reach the North Pole to warn Santa before the Easter Bunny, April Fool, Baby New Year and the others do?

Running Time: 116 minutes

Great DVD to add to the Nicktoon fun.",1316736000,5,1840,4.837579617834395

1906194,3,B0000AI425,"I love the trend of putting television shows on DVD, it never quite caught on for VHS, at least not like the DVDs.  Anyway, this DVD includes some fantastic Christmas episodes sure to become classics like Spongebob and The Fairly Oddparents (the others aren't all that entertaining in my opinion).  But where are the other classics that I have come to know and love, like Hey Arnold and the first Rugrats Christmas-The Santa Experience?  These ones are truely special and entertaining (and what's more have stood up to year after year of viewing).  Nick has a huge stash of great Christmas episodes of their Nicktoons, let's hope there will be a volume two for next year.  But frankly, the two good episodes are worth the price of the whole DVD.  Unless you have a DVD burner set up to record next year.",1077321600,8,803,4.619718309859155
