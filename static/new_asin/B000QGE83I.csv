2838999,5,B000QGE83I,"I really enjoyed both of these movies.  In ""Just Desserts"" a Bronx pastry chef (Mandylor) decides he needs to win a pastry contest in order to save his bakery.  Apparently, all the local businesses are either being bought out or torn down.  His own family bakery is struggling and his uncle wants to sell it to a chain donut company.  In order to enter the pastry contest Mandylor must have a partner.  He recently had a run-in with an attractive restaurant pastry chef (Lauren Holly), and solicits her cooperation.  Reluctantly, she agrees on the emphatic condition that their relationship will be strictly ""Just Desserts"".  Of course, it doesn't turn out that way, but getting ""beyond desserts"" and fighting it out in the contest are all great fun.
The other movie ""Wedding Daze"" is also a great fun family film.  You will really enjoy this film if you have ever planned some big event in your life and found that you had to put it on hold, or forget about it altogether, because your children, not really intending to interfere, but planning their own big events that necessarily involve you.  In this film, a couple is planning a trip around the world as a sort of second honeymoon.  One by one each of their daughters announce their engagements and, of course, each engagement results in a more modest second-honeymoon trip.  At any rate, it is great fun.
I felt the acting was very good, the music, especially in ""Desserts"" was also very good, and, as stated above, I loved the stories.",1234396800,4,1492,4.7

8196374,5,B000QGE83I,"Wedding Daze is funny and a pure pleasure to watch. The cast works well together and the plot is very believable. I'm so tired of Hollywood's idea of entertaining us with violence of all kinds so I rarely purchase movies that aren't made for TV anymore.

Just Desserts is a cute movie worth watching over and over. No violence, no swearing and no bouncing T&A. It's no Hollywood Blockbuster but great for the whole family. That's what I love the most about both of these movies.",1363910400,,478,4.558139534883721
