6282705,5,B00INLE6HG,"First of all, a huge thank you to those responsible for making a wonderful film which takes place in 1919, yet has practically no use of the tobacco drug!

A stellar period piece, with interesting depictions of the how many of the rich got their wealth by worker abuse and other corrupt means (i.e. John D. Rockefeller) and how others tried using terrorism to achieve their goals.

David Strathairn deserves an Oscar for his subdued but powerful performance and Ray Wise as Attorney General Palmer is the guy you'll love to hate (or maybe for whom you'd vote, if you like republicons!)

I highly recommend No God, No Master for anyone 16 and over!",1398729600,4,647,4.657894736842105

6282707,3,B00INLE6HG,"The IWW or Wobblies were a the center of the Anarchist movement and rather than being a labor union, as many now often think of them, were committed revolutionaries, not merely trying to improve working conditions but dedicated to violently seizing the means of production. They were also aggressively racist, as they drove Chinese and blacks out of Western states. Before the events depicted in this film they were already practicing terrorism in Montana and Idaho, killing and bombing, waging war on the mines, not for noble purposes, but to seize them. They were essentially communists, and perhaps more importantly, the basis for the labor movement in the United States. John D. Rockefeller is used here almost as a strawman, because elsewhere and long before this episode the anarchists were on the attack, instigating rather than being the victims of violence, and in Marxist style using terrorism to provoke crackdowns in order to justify further violent attacks and to create a broader revolution. While the Marxism dropped away from the labor movement over time, and with FDR basically helping them achieve legitimacy, they continued the violent tactics, and to this day the Teamsters are the subject of hundreds of violence complaints per year, which cannot be prosecuted due to the nature of labor law that considers all this within the context of ""collective bargaining."" Basically, it's legalized crime. Anyone who has ever been the victim of the threats and intimidation of the Teamsters, at knife point, gun point, and with firebombing of employee and management vehicles, and drive by shootings into the houses of management, knows all too well the tradition initiated by the IWW and carried on by various aspects of Unions today. Further, even those Unions that do not use guns, knives and explosives, resort to thuggery and intimidation, including public employee unions. The entire labor union movement has criminality (legalized, as it were) as its foundation and modus operandi.",1525478400,,1999,5.211180124223603
6282708,5,B00INLE6HG,True to its word - not to many people know of how Italians were looked upon in the early 20th century,1515542400,,101,3.857142857142857
6282709,1,B00INLE6HG,"David Strathairn is a brilliant actor and as always is great.  The movie itself was just cheaply done, the plot muddled and the screenplay sucked.",1514592000,,146,4.84
6282710,5,B00INLE6HG,"Especially with understanding that makers had rather small budget to work with, the result is truly outstanding. I wish they had more opportunity to lay out the plot fully, with more realistic, convincing detail -  it could then become something akin to the Battle of Algiers. Still, it feels true to the essence, at least to the sufficiently educated look.
I sure agree, that there's an element there of what some would view as ""propaganda"" - however, I would rather label that part as 'maker's point of view'. Anyone should be aware of their first amendment right, so no wonder that filmmakers in particular follow this path to their freedom.
At the same time, that means respecting other's point of view to the matter. Hence, I am not criticizing anyone who's ""not liking""  this film - rather, I suggest that they educate themselves on the history of workers' rights movement, actual (political, cultural, economical) history of this country, and reality of the problems that we as people are facing right now - and while immigration questions are not unimportant, questions of distribution of political and economical power, equality of economical and political opportunities, and basic human rights are all coming to mind first while watching this film.

6282717,4,B00INLE6HG,A lot was covered in this movie.  The director was a little too eager to push an agenda.  Hoover was a schmuck.  If that's all the director wanted to prove in this movie I wish he would have renamed it.  It was pretty good.,1494115200,,223,4.0

6282725,5,B00INLE6HG,"Another fine example of quasi-history and done without the over development of characters no one really has any deep historical information about. Get a grip on what you are watching here. It's entertainment produced by the entertainment industry. If you want a more in depth look at the true history of the time period watch a documentary or read books, but always remember that stories are told from the singular perspective of the story teller. I suspect that only a college history major would know about the anarchism of the time but, oh, that's right, history majors no longer have to study American history so who knows? The story was captivating, the acting was excellent. The only other pertinent question is how many viewers looked up the definition of anarchy on their phones while they were watching.",1486339200,2,812,4.934306569343065
6282726,1,B00INLE6HG,"No God, No Master is just possibly the most predictable bit of hagiography ever produced about Sacco and Vanzetti.  And that is saying a lot. If you like films that attempt to canonize convicted criminals (who just happened to be guilty) and portray civil society as the real culprit, you can still skip this one.  Just catch some video of Black Lives Matter rioters demanding the death of ""pigs,"" or watch CNN as it justifies urban looters while they destroy their cities, and you'll get the gist.  Or better still, join the ""Free Mumia abu Jumal"" crowd.  The theme is not all that complicated.  It comes to you straight from Animal Farm.  ""Anarchists good!  Peaceful citizens and the police who serve them bad!""  Don't get me wrong.  There is a market for this genre.  Some people like their morality served upside down.

6282730,4,B00INLE6HG,"Set around 1919, this film tells the story of the deportation of hundreds of immigrants suspected of Leftist ties.  David Strathairn seems to flourish playing rles of righteous indignation and moral probity.  One critic said of this film, "" A stodgy banquet of idealistic speeches and weeping violins"".  Those remarks tell me that the author is probably terrified to take a moral stand against anything, envies those that have the courage to take such a stand, would not be indignant if children were sent to work in the mines at the age of ten, and probably welcomes Trump's Executive Order banning all Muslims, temporarily, from entering the United States.

6282739,4,B00INLE6HG,"I think I liked this movie for the very same reason someone else did not like it.  I didn't want a movie about the Sacco & Vanzetti Murder Trial.  Much is known about that.  I wanted a movie about the times and people.  David Strathairn plays Agent Flynn, an agent of the budding Bureau of Investigation in New York.  It should be noted here that a subtitle to this movie might be called ""The Case of the Vanishing Accent"" as in a few scenes Strathairn has the Irish accent of his character yet in most he does not.  Suffice it to say, that's a little picky but certainly noticable.

Both my wife and I enjoy the movie.  Not only was it entertaining but well played out and written.  There's a bit of underlying information that most people know little about.  The times were the times and the people were the people.  Interesting and Enjoyable to watch, is my verdict.",1485561600,8,869,4.40251572327044

It's frightening to see that the trouble we are experiencing with terrorists today in America actually started back in the early 1900s!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is not exactly a blockbuster movie and it is a little slow in parts, but it's definitely worth watching!",1485388800,,386,4.422535211267606

I felt the film was very informative, but it dragged at times. David Strathairn received an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination for best actor. He played an FBI agent who, contrary to the head of the FBI and his assistant J. Edgar Hoover, was very sympathetic to the workers. The head of the FBI ran for president after this affair and lost. The man played by Strathairn then led the FBI for two years, and was followed in this position by Hoover for over 40 years.
The film tells about two Italians Sacco and Vanzetti who were charged with robbery and murder of a bank guard and a man who was carrying money. They were executed in 1927 after spending seven years in Jail. Fifty years later, in 1977 Governor Dukakis declared that the two were innocent.",1479772800,,957,4.382022471910112

The problem is that the screenplay isn't tightly focused on any one strand of the story. It's got some Oliver Stone going on, with the Attorney General/J. Edgar Hoover angle, and that ultimately wins the most development; it's got a love story that has no juice to speak of because it's got no screen time; it's got a buddy-flick set-up between Straithairn and Witwer that has no resonance; it's got more and more and more.

I should have loved this and instead I kept thinking about how to trim it down and tighten it up. A noble attempt to tell a story with deep resonances to today's world. Actors and audience deserve more clarity of purpose and forcefulness of action.",1478563200,11,831,4.64625850340136

No God, No Master (2013) is thoroughly ridiculous in its attempts to unify some type of coherent story by putting together a conglomeration of notorious events and characters (Industrial Workers of the World, John D. Rockefeller, Sacco and Vanzetti, The Palmer Raids (1919 and 1920), Emma Goldman, and J. Edgar Hoover, into a debilitated storyline.

The acting is horrendously weak, the script, loose and dead, and I even noticed many mistakes (camera light in automobile windshield reflection, reflection of a modern skyscraper apartment in a shop window, the ""yellow lines"" of a modern road that were heaped with dirt but still visible).

At its most simplistic, No God, No Master is merely a torrid attempt at anarchist propaganda.  Most of the scenes are contrived and stilted, and the budget hampers the effective power.

It is average.  Reds (1981), The Molly Maguires (1970), Germinal (1993) and Matewan (1987) (which also had David Strathairn) are far superior films.",1458864000,,1017,5.208588957055214

First, it tries to depict an FBI 'bomb expert' accusing Rockefeller, to his face, in his home, for being responsible for the anarchists' bombings because he had company stores that paid employees with ""scrip"".  Many work locations would have NO store if not for the company store, and people would have to walk for tens of miles to do basic shopping.  In most cases, this was a credit operation, because workers were part of the new consumer class, and over spending.  Scrip could be exchanged for cash, at the end of the term of employment.  Many did not fritter away their credit and collected excellent wages by spending very carefully and frugally.

This movie tends to blame the ""rich"" and all the evil in the world was laid at their feet, with only a token of responsibility laid at the feet of brutal, communist, union organizers.  Our modern version are groups such as BLM.",1457827200,3,934,4.763975155279503

Ironic that the Mafia became a criminal force ensconced in the halls of power: political, economic and to some extent social for decades, replacing the IWW in the Union Movement wielding great influence over Amerikan life.  Now the Russian and Japanese Mafia has supplanted it and how easily this might have been avoided except for Hoover's rabid fear of and hatred for Organized Labor over his entire career.  One can only speculate what might have happened had the IWW been able to establish it's supremacy over Labor rather than the individual Labor Unions formed by the AFL-CIO later in the 30's dominated by the Mafia; especially the ILU, the Teamsters, USW, and the UMW.",1452211200,,891,4.803921568627451

I did admire the David Strathairn characters ability to defuse a bomb.  A simpler time, no need for SWAT, HAZ-MAT, teamwork.  But then he seemed naive, bucking the system, seemingly unaware how things had been working for so long.  Then a young J. Edgar Hoover appears and the lead sees evil from the get-go.  Preachy stuff.

More irritating, it clearly ""took sides,"" while unconvincingly maintaining a pretense of magisterial detachment.  Anarchist murderers Sacco and Vanzetti are portrayed as innocent, enlightened and saintly, even though the evidence of their guilt was highly presumptive by the time this movie was made.

I am a history teacher, so I can connect the dots, but I doubt most interested viewers can do the same. There was quite a lot a mayhem occurring during the time encompassed by the movie, and the chronology of the events are important if we are to understand what may have happened as a result of what.

So, in the event folks are interested, I offer the timeline here of events in the movie:

Ludlow, CO Coal Strike/Massacre: 1913-14
Letter bombs and Red Scare Palmer Raids: 1919
JP Morgan Wall Street bombing: 1920
Sacco and Vanzetti alleged crime: 1920
Sacco and Vanzetti execution: 1927

The most egregious labor-related violence in all of US history during this period occurred in 1921 during the Battle for Blair Mountain, an almost ""unknown"" immense military-style conflict that involved as many as 20,000 combatants. This battle was the result of events that transpired in a coal mine strike in the West Virginia town Matewan in 1921.

David Strathairn played Matewan's chief of police in Sayles' movie by the same name. Matewan is a great movie (though the sound is horrible). If you like No God, No Master, you may like Matewan even more.",1426636800,3,1263,4.675675675675675

Casting and actiing were jarring and boring. There was some attention to ""historical"" sets and clothing but not a lot. The actors still manage to look like completely modern Hollywood actors (""I'm not cutting MY hair that way!) dressed up for Halloween in sort-of period costumes.

It was REALLY hard to look at these people. I think it came down to the men being either slick gays' dreamboats or horrible old foagies. For the women, think the same.

An extraordinarily interesting and important part of American History that likely few Americans know much about. Though this production was decent, I was surprised it lacked more gravitas for such a pivotal time in American development. I do HIGHLY recommend this movie though.

The movie opens in the summer of 1919 with a string of bombings (and many more attempted bombings) carried out by anarchists fighting against socio-economic inequality and corporate dominance over the working man. Bureau of Investigations (BOI, later to become FBI) Agent William Flynn is tasked with bringing the responsible parties to justice. Package bombs or mail bombs are sent to many prominent members of government and the greatest of our business tycoons such as Oliver Wendall Holmes, JP Morgan, and Andrew Carnegie. Keep in mind that leading up to these events, President McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist and many years later conflicts like the Ludlow massacre were driving further animosity and violence between government and poorer workers. More recently, the government had adopted the immigration Act of 1918 which broadened the list of activities that could be considered anarchist and opened the door for anyone to be deported that the government deemed associated with the anarchists in any way. Flynn is able to quickly home in on a central figure Luigi Galleani who was inspiring the violence. The movie takes the opportunity to juxtapose Galleani with Carlo Tresca, who was leader of Industrial Workers of the World, and portrays Tresca as one seeking peaceful change through unionization. This story is a veritable who's who of individuals who changed the direction of our nation in the early 20th century. Figures like the young and quickly rising J Edgar Hoover appear everywhere. Hoover is central as he executes the Attorney General's plan to use the Immigration Act and Sedition Act to arrest and deport even innocent people (often Italian Americans) in the name of public safety. Agent Flynn develops many misgivings as he sees innocent persons being persecuted. Conversely, he displays great success in pursuing the actual anarchists and guilty persons. He is eventually recognized as the foremost anarchist specialist in the country and ascends as the director of the BOI, just a few years before J Edgar Hoover. This is only alluded to in the final credits. Great detail is given to maintaining historical accuracy in the movie. However, budget and casting leave this movie a notch or two below what it should be. It's solid, but cheap or melodramatic in areas. There are even a few unintentionally funny moments where dramatic moments gone wrong provide a good guffaw.

For the most part, the movie is not too preachy. However, when it gets preachy, it gets really preachy. I did not feel at all that this movie was a union apologist piece (and I am not always a fan of today's unions). I didn't even feel it was too anti-government-overreach until the advent of deported citizens and wrongfully convicted persons for a payroll murder in the latter part of the movie. However, these are facts history and well established. I wish they had been done a little less melodramatically so they didn't cheapen the importance of the events. Indeed, if one didn't briefly research the events, or at least pay attention to the closing credits, they would assume the court scene was completely contrived, melodramatic nonsense. In reality, it was a very important case and Carlo Tresca fought for the vindication of Sacco and Vanzetti for years. The movie takes great pains to humanize Sacco and Vanzetti and then hits you with their arrest and wrongful conviction later. Conversely, the movie softly sidesteps to some degree that these two still supported the anarchist movement. Sacco and Vanzetti were not publically vindicated until 1977 when Gov Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that they had been wrongly tried and convicted.

Even with Galleani deported, the movie ends on a fairly pessimistic tone with the 1920 Wall Street Bombing (the first major international act of terrorism on US soil). The movie does seem to hint at drawing parallels with today. We do not have income inequality and work conditions anywhere near the level they had in the age of the robber barons. However, since our own market crash, we have approached levels unparalleled since then. Obviously the issues of terrorism and what is the appropriate level of government oversight are very relevant. I think those points illustrated in this movie can be appreciated regardless of what side of the political debate one falls on. Foremost though, take it in for the tremendous history. I suggest only a rental.",1401235200,12,4796,5.105732484076433

It does this by invoking the heroic unions who are supposedly fighting those evil and rich capitalists. They were definitely rich but they were the furthest thing from capitalists. They (families like Rockefeller and Rothschild) acquired their immense wealth through cronyism. That is, some members within government made a deal with them and in return they were allowed to form a cartel that would make them immensely rich.
