8206159,5,B000SO7PC4,Wonderful TV Show!,1423958400,,18,5.333333333333333
8206160,5,B000SO7PC4,Extremely believable story of Police work linking with science/data and resulting in a captivating DVD series. Nothing 'hidden' to avoid....lots of compelling interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My husband really enjoys the reference to numbers and their effect on the overall completion of each session. Would recommend this set to anyone the most remotely interested in police craft and the resulting events.,1303948800,,423,5.3283582089552235
8206161,5,B000SO7PC4,"Fun TV show with a cool premise.  I love math, so it's delightful to see it starring in a major hollywood role.  ;-)",1273363200,,116,4.0
8206162,5,B000SO7PC4,"I Love this show and have been waiting to buy it...when i finally decided to spend the money, i was totally discussed when i received it in the mail. I didn't look at the movies to close because the box it was mailed in was in perfect condition. I couldn't wait to watch them so i opened them without even looking at them. It turns out that sometime before being mailed the set had been crushed. First and Second season books where mangled really bad like something heavy was set on top of them. Each one of them had cd's in which were loose because one of the pins was broken. I have order alot from amazon, and over the years have received movies that were some what messed up, but this was just wrong. This merchandise should have Never left the building. I do not plan on ordering from them any time soon because my brother just bought some movies and had the same thing happen to him. It's just being laze in my mind. I love the show and plan on buying the rest of the season. But Not from amazon!",1262217600,,1002,4.196891191709844
8206163,4,B000SO7PC4,I missed this on television and enjoyed the series on dvd. Interesting applications of math in mostly plain English. While the math solution is sometimes overkill it is done well enough. Decent story line.,1233360000,,205,5.0588235294117645
8206164,5,B000SO7PC4,This was a great buy and the service very good.  I LOVE the shows!,1226448000,,66,3.7142857142857144
8206165,5,B000SO7PC4,"Easily the best show on television.
I watch it all the time in remote Australia when ever it is on and couldn't wait to purchase the DVD set.
Get a copy of it and enjoy it as much as I have.
You'll not only get a great cop show to enjoy, but an insight into the world of Math, like never before.",1223769600,,295,3.774193548387097
8206166,5,B000SO7PC4,This is for the more nerdy crime drama lovers. Great story writing. I watched all the epsodes from all three seasons in a marathon with my wife over 4 months or so. We cant wait for the 4th season to come out.,1218412800,,209,4.0
8206167,4,B000SO7PC4,"I am a huge fan of Numbers so I just had to buy the DVD. All in all its great - only downside is the extras. Only one or two really worth watching but not much else. Most other DVD's have interviews and profiles but all we have here is chats to the creators, info on the SFX and a couple of blooper reels which are good don't get me wrong. Would just have expected a lot more.
Overall though if you are a fan this is a must have!",1207526400,2,429,3.7777777777777777
8206168,5,B000SO7PC4,"My husband and I are enjoying the series so far. It isn't real gory, so you can get the details of the crimes without seeing everything!",1203897600,,136,4.269230769230769
