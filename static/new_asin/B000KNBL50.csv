8158384,4,B000KNBL50,Harper is a private eye.  Paul Newman is Harper. And he is very good in  This ... a light murder / kidnap mystery that has many  other good stars in it.  ..Robert Wagner.  Lauren Bacall.  Janet Leigh.  It takes place in and of the style of the sixties.  It still holds your attention as a good caper movie.  I enjoyed seeing this nostalgic movie and seeing Paul Newman in one of his classic roles.,1378598400,,397,4.256756756756757
