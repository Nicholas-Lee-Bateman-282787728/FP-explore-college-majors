5072976,5,B007ATHNHC,"Received volumes 7-12 today from another vendor. Picture and sound are very good.

5072977,5,B007ATHNHC,"The claymation is classic! Actually, what I loved about this series most was less the fabulous claymation and more the old lessons kids learned from playing outside. It's an idyllic setting for an idyllic upbringing. And absolutely adorable, calm, and non-flashy like most kiddie stuff these days.",1419638400,,297,5.340425531914893

5072988,5,B007ATHNHC,"I ordered this collection three times! One for myself, one each for my daughters who are in their 40's one of whom I have grandchildren. You can't find things like this nowadays. Not only does it bring back memories, but even at age 65 I am still enjoying the beautiful inspirational messages in each episode. Anyone who wants to teach their little one's about God and moral values in a gentle and innocent way will enjoy this CD collection.",1393632000,2,441,4.594936708860759

5072993,5,B007ATHNHC,"I chose this rating because I simply LOVE Davey & Goliath not just because I grew up watching it, but the simplicity of their messages teaching about morality (being kind to others, wrong to steal, helping others, not judging others, etc.) using God as their moral compass to get out the the trouble they always find themselves in.  Though it is an older show from 1960 - 1975, I still find it to be an excellent show for little ones as they can understand and relate to both Davey and Goliath.  I recommend this to anyone regardless of your faith or non-faith as their messages talk on a level that relate to children.",1368144000,,619,4.469026548672566
5072994,1,B007ATHNHC,My husband and I purchased this set of Davey and Goliath because we had previously bought Vol. 1 thru 6 for our children and we had all really enjoyed them. They were clean old fashioned fun! I ordered this second set (7thru 12) and expected it to be the same. We were so disappointed. In each show Davey is very disrespectful of his parents and authority. He lies much of the time and there are no consequences. We ended up getting rid of them because they were so bad and not a good influence on our children. It was a total waist of money!,1358294400,3,542,4.221153846153846
5072995,5,B007ATHNHC,"It's Davey and Goliath. You have to have it.
I think you'll really enjoy the Christmas special-- it's really similar to A Charlie Brown Christmas.",1354147200,2,146,4.88
5072996,3,B007ATHNHC,"Davey & Goliath was always a favorite of ours growing up.  We believed this would be an excellent purchase & for the most part it was.  The first set, The Easter episode stopped working halfway through. We returned the set & reordered it, & it happened a 2nd time on The Easter episode & School Who Needs It?  Seems the problems lie with the 30 minute special episodes.  We kept the 2nd set & we fast forward when we get to the cut-off points.  Kind of disappointing to pay that much money & have difficulties.",1346284800,7,510,4.326315789473684
8513616,5,B007ATHNHC,"Before Larry the Cucumber and Bob the Tomato from the Veggie Tales videos, there was Davey, and his dog, Goliath. The stop-motion animation series was produced by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in the 1950s and 1960s to provide a Christian-based show for young viewers.

The 15-minute episodes center on Davey, a likable, polite, and hard-working kid who wonders how to apply his Christian faith and values to his everyday experiences. What made this show so approachable was its lack of good and evil dichotomies. Rather than sin and sinner storylines, these shows simply convey Daveys yearning to understand his place in Gods creation. While some of the shows deal with large social issues such as bullying, racism, and death, the majority of the plotlines explore Daveys daily journey of a faith-based life with Goliath by his side, both as companion and conscience.

Uncomplicated storylines, simple set designs of familiar characters and places, a thoughtful and kind central figure whose seriousness is balanced by his goofy yet loyal dog, anchor each show. The shows messages of love and forgiveness can trace its roots all the way back to Jesus and the New Testament teachings. I remember the powerful impression these shows had on me as a child. Despite the low-tech quality when compared to todays animation, my kids are equally riveted by this series.

This review applies to all the other shows within this beautifully produced series. Highly recommend for your family.",1489795200,2,1493,5.135802469135802
