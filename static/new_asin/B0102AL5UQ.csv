7304733,5,B0102AL5UQ,This was a beautiful anime experience! Watching Dandy and his crew explore so many different worlds and genres was wildly fun. I always found something entertaining in every episode even my least favorite ones. The only thing I hated about this show was that it needed to be longer and I would've liked to see some characters return.,1447113600,3,333,4.758620689655173

7304736,5,B0102AL5UQ,"Amazing show. Space dandy is sometimes accused of having no story, or paying too lose with its continuity. Although all of these decrepences are explained in the last episode, this episodic style of anime is exactly what watanabe intended. Each episode had a different director, each episode has a unique feel. Space dandy is a show about a dandy guy in space. That's it. That's not nessisarly a bad thing, and defiantly doesn't mean that the show can't get deep when it wants.  Space dandy is a show with no restrictions, it isn't binded by the rules of a drama or comedy or even by the rules of continuity, you can't fit space dandy into a pre determined box or label it. Space dandy is a overall good time. It's a fun show with wacky characters, but so hard to describe and defiantly a chalange to review.  So all I can say is just give it a try, and stay dandy baby.",1443225600,12,870,4.364197530864198
7304737,5,B0102AL5UQ,"A quality blu-ray/dvd combo release of the excellent second season of Space Dandy. Season 2 is even more rewatchable than the first, with the variety of story and visual approaches from episode to episode managing more hits than misses.

The episodes here are as expected colorful, sharp and detailed on the blu-ray, while dvd episodes I sampled are also no slouch. Disc 1 on the the blu-ray carries episodes 14-23 (numbered as a continuation from Season 1), and disc 2 has episodes 24-26 and assorted extras. There are trailers, textless songs, commercials, and commentaries. The two included dvds are split 14-20 and 21-26 in terms of episodes.

The English dub commentaries are also fun to listen to. Especially Episode 19 featuring Colleen Clinkenbeard and Alexis Tipton. Also of note is a video interview detailing the process of creating the well-regarded English dub, including the voice of Space Dandy, Ian Sinclair.

This release also features an appealing reverse cover that features Dandy with ukulele on the front with Meow and QT in the background while Honey graces the back cover alongside a features list. Agreeably, there is a title on the reverse spine as well.",1443139200,5,1179,5.06701030927835

7304739,5,B0102AL5UQ,"If you're reading this I'm going to assume that you've seen the first season, but just in case you haven't Space Dandy is awesome and is worth your time.  Dandy along with his two sidekicks, a outdated robot and a lazy cat creature travel the Galaxy looking for undiscovered aliens, but the problem is they almost always fail, which can be pretty funny.  That being said Dany is not a complete joke.  There are some  incredible visuals in this series, and has a different director each episode, which makes it feel like a new series each episode.  There is one all viewer should be aware of, and that is that this is a parody of a mix of animes.  Most notable the action, and fan service anime series, so don't take Dandy too serious and you'll have a great time watching him.

Now that's out of the way the second half of the series was a wonderful  conclusion to the first half, and had its share of funny characters and out of this world visuals.  But more importantly by the end everything is pulled together, and by the last episode you will be left with an awesome felling.

7304756,5,B0102AL5UQ,"Animation - Top notch animation going on here. The aliens, worlds, galaxies, and settings all feel so alive with the lush saturation of colors that are presented to you. Whether its fight scenes that end up dandy bagging an alien that is worth squat or the trio wasting time; you will enjoy the pretty colors and lush scenes.

Music - Man, that intro song is so freaking catchy. It definitely gets you going and could be a good song for exercising and dancing. Watanabe chose to not have instruments after like the 1970's. That intro song definitely sticks to your mind after watching two seasons of space dandy. Wow, the whole glee based episode was pretty hilarious to see. But definitely shows there was a lot of love here in making this anime completely random.

Story - Random as always, though the last few episodes tries to finish up the anime with a bang. The whole pionium conclusion about dandy is revealed to you and pretty explains why dandy encounters such odd situations.

Price - Funimation has it done right, enough said. Though seriously funimation's collections are very affordable and go look at aniplex; you would shudder the prices that they try to charge for a couple of episodes

All in all -  seriously why haven't picked up both seasons yet, and if your not enticed enough. Then go try the first episodes out on funimation's site.",1454025600,,1355,4.70042194092827

7304758,5,B0102AL5UQ,"Got this as a birthday gift for the husband.  We had seen most of the episodes online already, but if I like a series, I try to buy it.  This one is totally worth having.  The animation is mostly good, the sound quality is excellent, and the series itself is strange and entertaining.  If you are worried you won't like it, find someplace to stream a few episodes online, but if you watch it, you will probably want to buy the rest of the episodes.  Also, added bonus, it takes place in the same universe as Space Cowboy...so watch out for some Easter Eggs from that one...like a refrigerator.",1450656000,4,593,4.4036697247706424
