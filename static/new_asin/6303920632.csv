7854862,5,6303920632,"Oistrakh was, for me, the best musican for any instrument in any genre. This recording of the Tchaikovsky is the best I have ever heard. Notable CD recordings of this great concerto include Heifetz, Milstein, Kogan, Perlman, and Rabin but there are none I prefer to this video.
Some come close, but I like this video of the Tchaikovsky the best. Perlman's video with Ormandy that is also very very good if you can find it, however. I also own the Szeryng video which wasn't half as good to me. The Mullova video is also very good and is worth seeing. There are also clips of Rabin and Ricci playing the third movement of the Tchaikovsky in the DVD ""Great Violinists of the Bell Telephone Hour"".
For the Sibelius, there are none finer available on video. I also liked this performance alot more than Vengerov's DVD. Now if I could get a video of Neveu playing the Sibelius that would be something as she actually beat Mr. Oistrakh in a violin competition once.
Do yourself a big big big favor and buy this video if you still can!
