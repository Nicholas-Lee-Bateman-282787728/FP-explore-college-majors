3591327,5,B001G0MFLU,"Honestly, Jim dying was what grabbed me and pulled me in to watching. I was literally channel-flipping. I saw him with JLH's character and said, ""oooh, he's cute,"" and watched the episode. I'd sort of looked on the show a bit here and there but really didn't make time to watch but wow! I'm making up for it now. I've backtracked to see what I'd missed and this is a really smart show. There's so much on TV, some shows really aren't appreciated they way they should be. An instant hit isn't always the best hit.

I look forward to this show every week and will buy season 4 when it comes out.",1237248000,17,593,4.247787610619469

3591329,5,B001G0MFLU,"Ghost Whisperer is one of the best shows put on tv in a long time...There is no complaints from me about the show..Melinda helps alot of ghosts and people..The things she does for them is so amazing..There has been a few times that i have cried from it being so touching and you feel like you are there..Some of the shows touch close to home beings i have lost some close family members..Its a must see for anyone who hasn't seen it and its one that you can watch over and over again..

Shows that deal with the main story arc are more interesting than ""ghost of the week"" episodes which were more prevalent the first few seasons.

3592387,5,B001G0MFLU,"This is a very exciting season. It held a good grip of me from first to last episode that I was watching in marathon.
Spoiler: Jim died and wouldn't cross over in spite of Melinda's insistance - which is something she don't particularly like to do because she loves him dearly but knows it's the right thing to do. Then Jim finds a way to return, by being into someone's body who was at the verge of death. Thing is, onve Jim is inside that body he doesn not remember who he is (Sam) or who he really is (Jim). This makes the whole season exciting because you can't wait to know what and how happy ending it will be, or end in tragedy.
At each episode, there is still crying here and there as it culminates into conclusion for the dead and their loved one or unfinished business before they go into the light.
This is a must see season. Dont miss it.",1437177600,2,850,4.189024390243903

3592672,5,B001G0MFLU,"[note: this is a review of the series, not the DVDs so much]

So, this is what Jessica Love Hewitt is up to these days. I'm not a fan of ghost stories generally and would normally warn those who aren't to shy away from this series. However, if you can get by the ghosts, several of the episodes use the ghost story as a plot device to explore compelling HUMAN stories (somewhat like Hewitt's film ""If Only""). As such, even if you don't like ghosts, read on:

The good:
In the episodes I've seen at least, the story with the ghosts provided a segway into a far more compelling human drama. For example, in one episode I saw, the ghosts torment a father and daughter who feel guilty over the mother's death. The emotionally compelling part of the episode was seeing the father and daughter deal with their guilt and frustration. Hewitt, as the ghost whisperer, indirectly helps these catharses.

Now, the bad:
The ghosts aren't subtle. With a few exceptions (generally shadows in a dark room), the ghosts look and act just like normal people, only that ""only"" Hewitt can see them. There's no especially pale skin, glow, or anything else to make the ghosts seem supernatural. Admittedly, this varies by episode, and some ghosts seem to have supernatural powers. Still, don't expect freaky special effects.

In short, if you like the type of sitcom/dramas generally shown on the WE channel, you might like Ghost Whisperer. Don't be too turned off by the ghosts in the stories (even if the ghosts can get snarky at times). However, this isn't a sci-fi series or comedy sitcom.",1258502400,,1571,4.681159420289855

3592706,5,B001G0MFLU,"This is show is unique and amazing in many ways. No matter how ""weird"" or ""supernatural"" an episode gets, it still somehow seems almost realistic. This season DEFINITELY shows that with all of the drama that happens with Jim. Some people say that this choice was unneeded and it made the show worse. I disagree with those people because it showed how functionable and lovable Jim and Melinda's marriage is. On TV nowadays, it's all about sex and divorce. This show instead shows the happiness and hopefully true side of marriage. The episodes in this season are much darker and more intense, in my opinion. I look at the first season now and I'm like...wow...that seems so juvenile compared to where they are at now. It's amazing how much this show has progressed and matured. The first season was amazing when I watched it and I thought it was intense then, but each season gets better and better, unlike other shows. Buy this season now!! Fifth season has just started so you should watch that too!!! This show is amazing and you will love it. It's the only show, that I know of, that can go into almost full-on horror/suspense movie flick and then have a lovable, happy ending.",1254528000,8,1180,4.650717703349282

The fact that he died confused me since it didn't coincide with the earlier show I saw.  So I began to watch it just to understand what had happened, and was amazed at the concept.

Then when the husband died and came back, that was the last straw for my husband. I still love the show, despite all the crazy plot twists and actor changes. I will definitely be buying this season.",1249430400,6,502,4.239583333333333
3592710,2,B001G0MFLU,"My husband and I have watched this show since the first episode. He because he thinks JLH is adorable - me because I like ghost stories!
We loved season 1. Jim Clancy (David Conrad) as Melinda's husband was just about perfect as any woman can want a husband to be - just like Joe DuBois (Jake Weber) - Alison's husband on Medium. We were very saddened at the end of the season at the loss of Andrea (Aisha Taylor) as Melinda's best friend and partner. She brought humor and someone for Melinda to talk to about her gift. Season 1 gets 5 stars. *****
Season 2 introduces Delia (Camryn Manheim) as an uptight real estate agent who somehow ends up working for Melinda. I don't exactly remember how that happened since it was a few years ago. Delia DOES NOT BELIEVE in ghosts and certainly not that Melinda can see them. Not exactly a person I would choose to be friends with if I was Melinda. There was one shining spot in season two and that was Dr. Payne (Jay Mohr)! What a hoot! At first he does not believe, but is very interested in what Melinda is doing. His character was the best part of seasons 2 and 3. These 2 seasons get 4 stars. **** We own these 3 seasons on DVD. I pre-ordered all of them.
Season 4 gets all of 1 star * from us. First off, Dr Payne leaves on sabatical because Jay Mohr left the show. Automatically remove 1 star. Eli James (Jamie Kennedy) joins the show as a man who cannot see ghosts but only hears them. OK, remove another star. Then the powers that be decided that Jim needs to die. Remove 2 stars for this. And instead of him moving on into the light, he jumps into the body of another man who has died. But, instead of us seeing the new guy, we keep seeing David Conrad - I suppose this is least we forget that it is truly Jim Clancy. He spends half the season with amnesia - not knowing that he is really Jim and thinking he is the other guy and so on...... I would remove 2 stars for this also, but then we would be down to 0 stars. Instead we will only remove 1 more star for all of that and low and behold we are down to one star * for Season 4. I will not be buying this season as it is certainly not one that I want to remember. If you want to buy Seasons of Ghost Whisperer I recommend Season 1, then Season 3, followed by Season 2. I do not recommend Season 4 at all.",1248134400,17,2309,4.076923076923077

's storyline really good.  I enjoyed the first season and the fourth the best...  I really missed when her ""best friend"" left the show.  She was a great character ""Andrea"", and it took me awhile to get use to Dellia, but she grew on me.  Then ned, I liked the old one and the new one.  I see season for as a way to refresh the love and bond of Melinda and Jim/Sam.

 I came from watching the show The Medium,.. and after that, I found this show.  So I want to do some comparing, (just a bit)...Ok What I like about this show was there was less scary or disturbing things, then on the Medium.  However on the Medium, I like the ""realness"" of that family, Allison (Patricia Arequette) was a real wife and mom, very down to earth and she maintained her own weight, did not try to glam it up, or become something she was not.  She seemed like someone you want to be friends with.  This shows real 'home"" life fairly accurately; however, as Ghost Whisperer progressed, Melinda (Jennifer Love..) would wear these white thigh high boots and way too over the top clothing.  (What is it with her wearing ""all"" white?? in way too many episodes.  It was fake, and well....the over the top of Jennifer's character was why I took away one star.  All in all the Ghost whisperer had an upbeat feel, but not realistic.
