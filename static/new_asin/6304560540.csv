898844,3,6304560540,I dug this flik from the get-go. Killer soundtrack & bitchin' camerawork. Arquette makes up for those lousy phone commercials he does. Salma rocks.

Then the roller skating rink where he bend over and left oil on the floor. Selma is as beautiful as ever in this movie.  This movie was taking place in the 50's.  There was a lot of getting even with bad boy against bad boy. Then there was the bad officer, which happened to be the one boys father. He wanted his son to kill and even gave his son a gun.

899209,3,6304560540,"Robert Rodriguez's early effort ROADRACERS isn't necessarily a must-see movie.  It's not even, per say, a ""good"" movie, though it's definitely got its highlights.  Truly, it's more a film for two groups of people: Rodriguez fans (of which I am one), and those who love fifties rock 'n roll films (and exploitations thereof).

It's a film about Dude (David Arquette), who like pretty much every young male in the 1950s (at least in Hollywood-land) wants to buck the system, but he's just not sure how.  He's got a rivalry going with another young rebel (Jason Wiles), who happens to be the son of the local sheriff (William Sadler) who had a beef with Dude's father.  As in most Rodriguez films, things slowly escalate towards a riveting climax, propelled by outlandish performances and a killer soundtrack.

This has all of the hallmark stamps of later Rodriguez film: the music, the quick cuts, the fancy angles, the surprisingly strong performances.  Arquette oozes charm and insecurity in the perfect amounts; as his voluptuous girlfriend, Salma Hayek (making her English-language debut) is seductive and vulnerable, while retaining a certain fierce edge.  As Dude's friend Nixer, John Hawkes (character actor extraordinaire who shot into the spotlight with WINTER'S BONE) is an off-putting wonder.  The same goes for Sadler as Sarge--pure and utter menace, while managing to be incredibly amusing (see his opening scene).  Wiles, too, hits all the right notes.  And Rodriguez as writer/director manages a few strong points: the roller rink scene is near-perfect, and there are moments throughout that come close to equaling Rodriguez's later B-movie genius.  ROADRACERS is far from Rodriguez's best film, but considering it was shot in only 13 days, it's pretty damn good.",1354752000,,1776,5.214788732394366
899210,5,6304560540,I just love the pictures and updated sound quality from Bluray movies that were transfered from either VHS or older DVD's and so will YOU!!!!,1354579200,2,141,4.68
899211,4,6304560540,"In 1994 Lou Arkoff, son of the legendary American International Pictures producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, created and produced a series for Showtime called Rebel Highway. The concept was 1950's drive-in classic B-movies with a 90's edge. The movies didn't have to be remakes, but they did have to have the same title as an old AIP film. The series premiered on July 22, 1994 with Roadracers from co-writer/director Robert Rodriguez, which was just recently released on DVD and Bluray for the first time.

Roadracers follows Dude, a rebel greaser living in a small, dead end town with dreams of becoming a rockabilly star. Dude's dream seems to be in reach when his rivalry with the local sheriff and his son swings out of control.

The plot of Roadracers is really irrelevant. We've seen this story before. What's important here is the number of fantastic performances and the brilliant filmmaking of Rodriguez.

Rodriguez was brought in at the last minute to do the film after another director, Wes Craven, dropped out. Rodriguez had 10 days to write the script, 13 days to shoot, and 15 days to edit. If you're a fan of Robert Rodriguez you know this is right up his alley. What Rodriguez was able to create was a fun, fluent, quick moving movie that features an awesome rockabilly soundtrack and the best shot roller rink scene I have ever witnessed.

A young David Arquette stars as Dude, giving a performance full of angst and rebellion. Salma Hayek, making her United States film debut (this is the role that actually convinced Columbia Pictures to allow Rodriguez to cast Hayek in Desperado) , is along for the ride as Dude's girlfriend Donna. Arquette and Hayek have good chemistry and do a fine job but their co-stars steal the show.

Dark of the Matinee favorite John Hawkes plays Nixer, Dude's best friend. Despite often being annoying and sometimes gross, Nixer still has a certain charm that makes the Invasion of the Body Snatchers-obsessed sidekick extremely likable. Its easy to see why Hawkes became ""that guy"" that you always see pop up in things and stand out.

The town sheriff trying to run Dude out of town is played to perfection by William Sadler. Sadler's first scene may be the best of the film, at least delivery wise.

We find Sadler in his police cruiser with his new partner when he pulls pigs in a blanket out of his jacket. Sadler then begins to go on about how the bread is perfectly wrapped around the hot dog. He speaks of it as if its an art form. Its important to smell it, get a feel of it, take it all in before you eat it. Just brilliant.

This was Rodriguez's first time working with ""real"" actors but the final product leads you to believe he was already a seasoned pro. Roadracers was the perfect stepping stone to transition Rodriguez from his indie ways to working with larger Hollywood productions.

This isn't a great movie, but its a damn good one. If you're a fan of Robert Rodriguez, rockabilly, or you're just looking for a fun way to spend 80 plus minutes, I highly recommened Roadracers.",1346025600,2,3034,4.677298311444653
899212,4,6304560540,"A fun flick about a nutty kind of Dude who always goes for broke in everything he does/wants. No PC moments in this film, and maybe that's what makes it fun to watch. Not a great film, but plenty entertaining. You'll recognize most of the cast from appearances with Tarantino and Rodriguez. Video is fine, audio so-so. Not alot of punch with the car and gun sounds.",1338681600,2,365,4.462686567164179

899214,5,6304560540,"Great quotable lines & some hilarious hi-hinks.  Should be a cult classic like REPO MAN.  The 5 Stars is for the movie; hopefully, the BD will look & sound great.  Rodriguez said several years ago that he had remastered the flick for DVD release and that he was really pleased with the results.  Have been really looking forward to this for years (have about worn out the VHS copy & have copied it on DVD-R from cable).  Highly recommended for a fun time.",1330560000,,455,4.433734939759036
899215,5,6304560540,"Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff and Debra Hill for the Showtime channel in 1994.
 The concept was 10-week series of 1950s ""drive-in classic"" B-movies remade ""with a '90s edge"".[1] The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, ""what it would be like if you made Rebel Without a Cause today. It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off"".[2] Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, Raging Hormones but Showtime decided on Rebel Highway instead.[3] Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.[3] In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.[4] Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses. According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, ""They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.' And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era. We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation"".[3]

The series premiered with Robert Rodriguez's Roadracers on July 22, 1994.

899216,4,6304560540,"Some directors just 'get it.' They have a cool, easy sensibility and make their work look almost effortless. Robert Rodriguez is one of those directors. Like most directors he's not 100% but when he's good he's great. This made for Showtime piece is a ton of fun.

Here's the scoop. It's 1956 and the U.S. is in the midst of the Eisenhower era with its near nondescript character. Rock and Roll is starting to happen, particularly in Texas where the film is set. Buddy Holly, Bill Haley and Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys are starting to shake things up. Dude Delaney (David Arquette) plays a mean guitar but is not in a band. He has a gorgeous Mexican girlfriend (Salma Hayek) whom he cannot commit to though he loves her dearly. The local sheriff (William Sadler) wants to run him out of town as he did Dude's father. He's using his son to do so. How will all this shake out?

This is just a cool flick. It has a great Rock-a-Billy soundtrack with souped-up cars, roller rinks, greased-up hair and leather jackets. The bad guys are racist and stupid. Arquette doesn't cow-tow to the man. His close buddy (John Hawkes) is enthralled with the movie ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" which has just released to the theaters. It has a lot of great elements. Arquette has an epiphanal moment near the end where he sees the world like Kevin McCarthy sees it in the final scene of ""Invaders of the Body Snatchers"" where everyone is in danger of becoming soul-less creatures. He cannot let that happen to him so he needs to strike back.

The acting and overall production values are good. I had some reservations about Arquette in the lead but I warmed up to him by the end. Some of the elements are definitely a bit ""too"", (too much grease, too much spitting), but the rest is so watchable I have to forgive the excesses. This is a way good time. If you want to recapture a sense of personal freedom, this is the film to give you a hand.",1320883200,,1933,4.454802259887006

A 6.7 rating for a two week project is insane!!!!
With the amount of camera shots/editing that was done, this was a HUGE undertaking for being shot in only two weeks; not to mention it was written on the fly. Too bad others today can't work on such a tight budget and little time. Robert did an amazing job with such limited resources.
