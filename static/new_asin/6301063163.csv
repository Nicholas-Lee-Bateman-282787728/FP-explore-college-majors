7809488,4,6301063163,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie on Encore instead of paying
massive amounts of money since it is out of print. I loved reading
Harlequin novels and romance novels in general so I always want to
watch the film adaptations.

Anyhow, I'm 28 years old so naturally I'm accustomed to watching more
modern and fast paced movies. However, I already knew what to expect
since this was a 1987 movie.

Let me say that despite it being all, I enjoyed the movie and I'm glad
I woke up 6am in the morning just to catch it. It had a medium pace,
not as fast but not slow either. The acting I thought was good, the
relationship and chemistry believable as well as the scenery. Of
course, I always love the happy endings, hahaha.

Now as I was watching it at first, I was a little dismayed to see the
heroine having short hair. I don't know, I like my heroines to have
long hair because they seem more feminine, womanly, etc. Shorter hair
feels like the woman is a feminist/independent/etc. However as I
analyzed the movie even though its not really a deep movie to think
about all this analysis, I realized maybe the short hair was a good
idea. Even though you think the heroine seems independent and strong,
inside she is actually scared and weak (at first anyway regarding men
and love, etc.) Anyhoo, thats my analysis for the heroine. Otherwise
the actress did a great job in portraying her character.

On to the hero - well, I usually prefer my heroes, with dark hair.
Blondes just doesn't do it for me, they don't seem as manly or hunky.
Although this hero had that deep voice and rather big body, if they
colored his hair it would have been cool. However, despite my soso-ness
on his hair color, the hero did an EXCELLENT job. He was pretty
attractive and manly and yep, I believed his character. At first, he
was sort of arrogant and a player, but I believed it when he kinda fell
for the heroine and I thought it sweet and AWWWWW when he barged in and
just demanded the heroine that he has to take her home no ifs and buts
hahaha...!! Then of course the fact that later on he carries that other
woman on his shoulder and dumps her outside, I was like, right on!! And
of course when was trying to find the heroine and then later they meet
and super kiss, it was sweet ^_^ Now the scenes with the horses, it was
a little clichd/cheesy - the whole hero riding horseback for the
heroine through the waters, but I guess those scenes had their own
charm. Oh yes, i was shocked that the heroine could afford a castle,
but maybe it was discounted because of the supposed ghosts -_-

As for the story itself, at first I was worried it would be lots of
ghosts rattling, ghosts appearing kinda movie, but thankfully it
wasn't. After a few ghost scariness (not even that much) the story
definitely focused on the characters, how they fell in love, the ghost
story and the present, etc. Oh yah, and lets not forget the heroines'
past marriage situation and sister situation.

Anyway bottomline is this movie was definitely cute and entertained me.
I am glad I watched it and it is good for that rainy night.",1203811200,,3094,4.390924956369982

7809490,5,6301063163,"I came across this movie by accident one day and am pleased to say that I actually liked it. Sarah McAllister(played by Kathleen Quinlan)is finding it hard to deal with her husband's sudden death and is encouraged by friends to change her environment. After having a strange dream about a castle located in Scotland that she saw in a real estate ad, she decides to buy the castle( Uhh, how many people actually have enough money to buy a castle). When she gets herself settled, she is invited to a costume party where she meets Ross. The lovers have to overcome a lot of obstacles before they can be together(Sara's mistrust, a ghost, jealous woman). There were A LOT of clichs in this movie, but if you like harlequin books, this should be no surprise to you.",1169596800,3,760,4.554744525547445
