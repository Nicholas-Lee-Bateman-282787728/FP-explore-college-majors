8583162,3,B00CLROK7Y,"It is a very nice documentary DVD that is why i give it 3 stars
All I wanted is some dancing content for a personal project. With all the credits it is unusable
Guess that is good if someone wanted to copy this.",1386028800,,211,3.9302325581395348
8583163,3,B00CLROK7Y,The intermission between the next Samba bands was way too long.  For this type of production.  And could had spent more time on each Samba group.  This is Carnaval right?  We need to see the Queens of the Carnaval they are a part of the main thing why people watch the show.  It looks like each year the production company which is Brazilian cannot get their act together.  That is so sad.,1376611200,,389,4.333333333333333
