8561406,5,B000AASIQI,"I am a great fan of French films and have been saddened by their quality in recent years.  However, there is an exception for a few years in the late nineties and early 2000's like Amelie (2001) and Love Me If You Dare (2003) (or Jeux d'Enfants).  This film is hysterical while still communicating powerful and moving truths about being single in your 30s and the fears and insecurities that come with it.  I would compare it favorably with When Harry Met Sally, even though this film is a ""huit clos"" taking place entirely over the course of a dinner gone horribly wrong, while When Harry Met Sally is a wide-ranging, extroverted film that is as much a love poem to New York as it is about two individuals who discover each other over a decade.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1344384000,,783,4.492957746478873
