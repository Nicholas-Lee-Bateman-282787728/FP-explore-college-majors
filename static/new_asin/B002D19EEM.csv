8364713,5,B002D19EEM,"For those of you who want to know the truth about a subject almost completely ignored in the Western Media and rarely if ever spoken of in ""polite society"" for fear of offending the sensibilities of Muslims and their allies, this is the documentary to watch. This is the true story that is shameful and horrifying but nevertheless true. This video should be seen by every American, especially Christians and Jews who are willing to hear the voices of Christians who have suffered for decades in places like Egypt and Lebanon, and throughout the regions controlled by those Muslims who openly preach hate and violence against Christians and Jews and make no bones about their ""holy"" war to spread Islam and impose dhimmi status on Christians and Jews who are forced to pay the tax for mafia like protection by Muslim rulers  or  face death for refusing to convert to Islam.  The persecution and violence including rape  and murder is going on now.  Wake up before we face what these Christians have endured and are enduring to this day in the Middle East.",1387584000,5,1054,4.737704918032787
8364714,5,B002D19EEM,"This film is shocking. I thought that I was up on current events, I just can't believe what they did at that church, and it was not even noted on any mainstream media. This was for me a watershed event, in the sense that I now see just how completely anti-Christian the mainstream media is. It's just unbelievable. I still to this day can't believe it.",1317859200,10,352,4.348484848484849
8364715,5,B002D19EEM,"This documentary fills the black hole in history, and draws the line between ancient islam and todays terrorism. To understand the suffering of the christians in the Middle East, you need to look at this black hole in history, and this film does that. Must see.",1306972800,8,261,4.695652173913044
8364716,5,B002D19EEM,"This video is a ""must see"" for  everyone who is curious about Islam, and understanding 9-11. This video shows in a shocking and terrifying way, the reality of the ugliness of radical Islam that is carried out by the most ""devout"" followers of the Koran, which commands Jihad against infidels. No one who watches this spellbinding film, can be left without feeling disturbed by the oppression and barbaric treatment that Jews and Christians are subject to at the hands of Islamists, who seek Islamic world domination (and a return of the caliphate.) Political correctness makes this film and this topic untouchable on network TV. The only way to understand Islam, and connect the dots as to why 9-11 happened, and why Islamic aggression has happened throughout the world, and continues to this day, is to view this film and start to peel back  the facade of the ""religion of peace"". This should be mandatory for all school children, and all ""truthers.""",1268611200,10,951,4.900621118012422
