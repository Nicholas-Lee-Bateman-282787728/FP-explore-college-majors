7307906,5,B010CHR1ES,"I LOVE THIS SHOW. I love Omari Hardwick (he is hot and he can act), and yes, he is why I started watching the show.  I love his scenes with Tommy (J. Sikora), but the scenes with Angela (L. Loren) and Tasha (Naturi Naughton) are good too.  The acting is good.  The plot keeps me on the edge of my seat. The writing is top shelf (The show creator, Courtney Kemp Agboh, came from The Good Wife, so if you watched that show, you know the writing is some of the best on TV).  Season 1 was good and I waited on pins and needles for Season 2, which was a blockbuster.  I spent the last 6 months going on and on to my family and friends about how I could not wait until Season 3 came out in mid July 2016.  Season 3 has not disappointed (Shout out to Akina Noni Rose who is acting her behind OFF).  This is the only show I watch over and over.  I see something new every time in every episode.  The layering (acting, sets\images, writing) used to tell the story is intricate and amazing.  SHOUT OUT to Courtney Kemp Agboh.

My suggestion -- hurry up and get through Seasons 1 & 2, so you can get to Season 3.  So far,  I think Season 2 was the best of the 3, but Season 3, episode 5 just blew my mind and the season is only half over.

This is the best show on TV.  Point. Blank. Period.

ADD'L thoughts- 1\1\17 - I recently heard this show did not get nominated for any awards. Simply Incredible. This show deserves awards for the writing and the acting of Omari Hardwick, J.Sikora & Anika Noni Rose -- at a minimum. I am watching Seasons 1 & 2 for the 10th time and searching the stores for Season 3 weekly.

Also, I would now add This Is Us as another great show on TV, but it is neck and neck with Power.",1471219200,3,1701,4.0148809523809526
7307907,5,B010CHR1ES,"OMG! I LOVE LOVE this show! At first the character ""Tommy"" I doubted that he should even be in this show but after the 3rd episode I was sold and freaking Love this guy, The cast is exceptional and the story line is so raw and suspensful i have found myself addicted in finding out what happens next each time an episode ends. By Season 2 Episode 5 I am talking to the TV like the cast/actors can hear me telling them what they should do next.

Ghost (Omari) keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how he will think his way they Kenan (50 Cent) next dirty dealin plan. While Tommy runs on raw emotion. Right to the explosive end. Any more would ruin it. I give it Five Stars.  If  you have ever been interested in how the high level dope dealing game from USA to Latin America works, you wanna see.

I saw a marathon of the show when I was traveling and I was instantly hooked.  Since I didn't have Starz as part of my subscription with DirecTV, seeing it via Amazon Prime was extremely handy!

As for the show itself, I LOVE IT. It's real and raw (sometimes a little too real or raw for my taste, but I just turn my head and wait for the next scene, hence the reason for 4 out of 5 stars!).  The compelling conflict within Ghost wanting to go legit combined with all the double and triple crossings with all the other characters keep me yearning for Sunday so I can see a new episode.

Some might say that there is too much sex---and the sex scenes are very graphic, but not over the top. Mainly because they are realistic.

7308254,2,B010CHR1ES,Too many sex scenes.,1466294400,,20,4.25
7308255,5,B010CHR1ES,"I'm glad the storyline showed being a mistress is a fantasy and seemingly a fairytale. I wasn't sure which direction the show runner would take it before I started to watch S2. Jamie was his best self with Angela because it was only for stolen brief moments together. His marriage with Tasha was raw and honest (90%) on many levels- business, family, and love. More importantly it showed Jamie/Ghost is selfish. Everything was about him and what he wanted and what benefited him the most. I still  believe Jamie would have the same affair with Angela even if Tasha was in favor of going legit. Jamie basically forcing Tasha to stay in a marriage to keep him legally safe although he doesn't require the same of Angela. I think Tasha would still protect Jamie 1000% more than Angela because Tasha has her family to consider verse Angela's ego and career. Angela is book smart but uses her looks to get what she wants and throws everybody else to the fire, including Jamie (she saw the text from his daughter asking to come home and Angela sleep with him to keep him there with her). In turn, Jamie practically destroyed her career but still begged and pleaded for her to be with him. Making her depend on him like Tasha. Jamie is just like Tommy but he doesn't realize it. Tommy may be addicted to cocaine and to toxic woman, who remind him of his mother but Jamie addiction the unknown of his life if Angela stayed in as teenagers. Tommy has said multiple times that when Angela first left she mess his head up badly. I hope they explore that more in s3.

My only downside is Kanan(sp?) surviving. Like really? What is this Batman or Jessica Jones? I think that move cheapen the season. I think (drug supplier) forgot his name is enough of a villain for the next season. He's has many layers as a character including crazy and unpredictable. And that will be enough to handle on all fronts.

Overall great season. I thought season 2 would be whack going into it but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it.",1466294400,2,2015,4.53021978021978

7308385,5,B010CHR1ES,"OMFG so I just finished watching S2 of ""Power"" and after catching up I decided to write a review for both seasons combined. I personally loved this television series. I also enjoy gritty and violent crime drama shows so this was right up my alley. The story centers around James St. Patrick AKA Ghost and Tommy Egan who run a lucrative business together and how it affects their lives. The story in S1 I enjoyed and though I have heard gripes that it pushed to fast I thought the tempo was on point. The second season though blew S1 out of the water in storytelling with every character getting a good amount of screen time and S2 definitely had a hell of a lot more drama and intrigue then S1 and I personally found that to be dope. I will move onto the acting which was Superb everyone was cast perfectly. Ghost played by Omari Hardwick was on point and my personal favorite Tommy Egan played by Joseph Sikora was a Beast at his role and by far the best partner to a main protagonist to any show I have ever seen and I watch a ton of television. The action was very well executed no pun intended lol. I mean it was good in S1 but it came out like a Hurricane in S2 with the allocated slots of bodies being dramatically increased. The action was on point and at certain times not cliche which I thought was very good since so many shows are cliche today. The cinematography and the location of the show was shot beautifully with every frame selling the lifestyle and danger behind the life. I will close with saying that this is a MUST-WATCH Show for anyone who loves gritty and gangster style shows with a ton of gray. The third season premiers in July. My hat goes off to Courtney Kemp Agboh and especially 50 cent AKA Curtis Jackson for creating and producing this Masterpiece. I hope that there will be a 4th season but one season at a time. Thanks and have a lovely night.",1463270400,9,1878,4.3229461756373935

7308518,5,B010CHR1ES,"The lead actor is really good and I have no idea who he is, plus Lela Loren is simply outstanding. I only heard about Power because of Empire, but Power is a significantly superior show in comparison to Empire. Quality story, character development and writing is the bedrock of Power.

The writing is tight, the characters are really well developed, I was shocked that this diverse ensemble could churn out such excellent work episode after episode. I was worried that mediocrity would seep in with the diversity, but here the work is stellar, everyone is on point! Keep it up!

Empire is candy, I will continue to watch, but I won't miss it if it is cancelled. Power must stay, it's just so nuanced how a character we should despise is completely humanized and I can't figure out how to hate or love his choices/actions. I watched Power from Saturday night to Sunday morning without going to bed, I just wanted to see one more episode.... This show is special!",1459814400,2,961,4.647058823529412

7308603,3,B010CHR1ES,"I've only seen 1 1/2 episodes of season 2, so it's a bit early to be asked to give my review. However, since I'm a team player and all... there is way too much ""50"" to suit me this year as opposed to in season 1. Even playing a largely autobiographical character, the guy can't act; he's just too reptilian for me as well. Season 2 is drenched in rap (the script writers apparently have run out of ideas for dialogue) and the constant use of the ""N"" word and ""B"" word in place of actual song lyrics is a repetitive turn off to me (I'm just down with it - sorry). While the recently demoted FBI agent is a babe, her deductive reasoning skills are among the worst in fictional crime solving. All of NYC knows who Ghost is what he does/sells except for her.  At least she looks like fun in the sack. The intrigue between Ghost and the character played by Victor Garber is one of the true highlights of the series. But no matter how you slice it, ""Power"" will probably not help ""50"" out of bankruptcy.",1453593600,,997,4.219895287958115

You raised the bar so high, I can't find a TV show or movie STRONG enough to feed my addiction. Empire has all the pop and some funny....but Power is the ultimate.  Don't make us wait so long between seasons.  Put it on WEEKLY !  I'll pay as long as you keep up that great storyline.....all good stories begin with good writers, you're the best.
Now...WORK ON A STRONGER MARKETING PLAN . Buy a Network promo hour after midnight.  I know once people see it, they will be hooked.  I have my 84 year old parents watching.  My friends all say they HEARD it's  good. But haven't seen it yet...blah blah... I can't  hold their hands- but i. KNOW if you give them  a FREE taste.....the STARZ channel will beat HBO for your target demographics....

A lot more could have been developed for the show. If they cut out a few of the sex scenes it might've made for a better show. But this is a 50 cent production so what would you expect.",1444176000,5,421,3.9647058823529413

For those who gave bad ratings because of the wait for the episodes release, you mess up the movies status for something that is not related to the movie at all. You pre-ordered the series!! That was your choice!! It was Amazon's choice to pre-sell them. Smh spend some time reading what you are purchasing so you are not left feeling so frustrated.

7308838,5,B010CHR1ES,"Just finished watching the entire season 2 of Power and wanted to give you guys my thoughts on the show. This season brings betrayal and suspense to a whole new level, I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time. The story-line for this show was really well paced. It wasn't incredibly complex, but what made it great was that it was realistic. This show isn't a glamorized version of what it would be like to be a boss of a drug gang in NY. It's a realistic setting with realistic scenarios that one might encounter in their situation. The mix of drama and the performances by the actors really sold the show for me and I felt that the whole season was great.  I never knew 50 cent was an actor, but damn he was good. I didn't like the way they tried to sell the relationship between Shawn and Tasha, it just seemed forced and out of place. Overall, I guess I'm just nitpicking at the small things. This show as a whole was fantastic and I'm glad I watched it!

7308867,5,B010CHR1ES,"This show is banging, it has the right street etiquette, politically balanced well both in the streets & legitimate businesses, not too much with the sex scenes, yet these scenes are intense, and it shows the intelligence of those that didn't go to college for their education, including those in prison. It's the reality behind the scenes that you don't hear about in real life. Ghost is the real deal, leading by example... Banging!!!",1440806400,,436,4.905405405405405

7308877,5,B010CHR1ES,"I would like to point out that when purchasing the season, it states episodes will be added as they become available.  This is NOT Amazon's fault, but the responsibility of Starz network.  Amazon can't add any episodes until Starz allows it.  I wish people would realize this, as the 1 star ratings are reflecting poorly on the show itself, and that just isn't fair to this amazing series!!!  If you are upset, complain to Starz....all formats of instant video...Amazon, Vudu, M-Go, Google Play, etc. are all stuck until Starz releases the episodes.

With that said....this show just keeps getting better!!  The first season laid the storyline...and the finale made way for the second season.  The second season has so many unexpected twists to the storyline, and it just keeps you wanting more!  The season finale for this season was one of the best finales I have ever seen!!!  Can't wait for the 3rd season....going to be absolutely amazing!!  You will not be disappointed with this series!!!",1440460800,8,995,4.9397590361445785

As season 2, begins there are major hurdles to overcome for Ghost, both on the personal and professional front. Ghost struggles to keep Angela, Tommy and others in his control. He also faces trouble from Simon Stern who prevents him from regaining the club. Meanwhile, Tommy - who looks to have the biggest impact as the season progresses - is aligning with fresh-out-of-jail Kanan (50 Cent's character who secretly ordered a hit on Ghost last season). Ghost's wife Tasha is also growing a lot more exasperated with his deceits and it looks like she might do something that will affect Ghost in a big way. Actors Omari Hardwick (Ghost) and Naturi Naughton (Tasha) have real chemistry as husband and wife, even though their marriage is in free fall, for they are not only husband wife but also business partners, regardless of their marital situation the emergence of Kanan looks to be a major threat to both of them.

This series just keeps on getting better.
