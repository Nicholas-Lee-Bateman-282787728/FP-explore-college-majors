2776999,5,B000NOKRF6,"These lessons from sites in Israel have given me a better understanding of Old Testament and New Testament life and times than any other teaching I've had.  Every family should watch these together.  They are simple, profound, and very effective at putting all the pieces of the puzzle together.",1202428800,38,295,5.0
2777010,5,B000NOKRF6,Just like you were there.  Ray does a great job bringing you into the world of the Bible in a way that nobody else does.  Been a fan for a LONG time. This is a great series.,1375056000,,173,3.6486486486486487
2777011,5,B000NOKRF6,"Buy this series!  Seriously, just do it!  It will bless your socks off as it teaches you some great new perspectives on biblical history.",1363132800,2,137,4.666666666666667
2777012,5,B000NOKRF6,"Absolutely recommend it without hesitation. Inspirational, informing, thought provoking material here. It holds up biblical authority and inspires me to dog deeper in the scriptures.",1357948800,,182,6.32
2777013,5,B000NOKRF6,"I have watched every one of Mr. VanderLaans studies and few are as useful or as instructive as these.  Not only have I enjoyed them personally I felt the need to share them with fellow Christians.  They have been the basis of some of my best received lessons in the Bible Study I lead.  I can only give my highest recommendations for the ""That the World May Know"" series.",1337644800,6,371,4.3478260869565215
2777014,5,B000NOKRF6,"I have been using this wonderful series with my Sunday school class - 50-60 year olds, and they have been well received.  Easy to understand and lots of good often not well known info.",1332979200,3,184,4.411764705882353
2777015,1,B000NOKRF6,"Caution, if you're troubled by the emergent church, pass this series by...Many people are purchasing this series without understanding that the theology behind it is NOT what they think it is...Vander Laan is a post-modern theologian whose message is that it's not important what you believe as long as you believe...",1330646400,9,317,5.235294117647059
2777016,5,B000NOKRF6,"That the World May Know Series (now twelve volumes in number and, prayerfully, counting) is a profoundly moving and highly instructive series on 'on site' lessons within the Holy Land, upon the sites where Jesus Christ, and those others whose lives and ministries are illuminated within the pages of the Bible, lived, worked, walked, laughed, cried and taught, providing the insight to the culture, the times, the geography, life situations, and circumstances in which they were so fashioned, that the message conveyed to all who would accept it, would remain alive within their very lives and surroundings; as such, recapturing these settings, Ray Vander Laan provides to us the intent and symbology which those who spoke with God's Voice, had passionately intended.  Some scriptures will gain a new depth, others will gain new aspects/facets which we were unaware comprised the 'whole picture', while others will gain such an impressive new emphasis, which up till now, had not been available to us because we have not lived during those times, and in those places, yet in this 'new hearing' imparting a new message to lift our heart, delight our mind, sustain the body, both humble and encourage the soul, and further illuminate our path walking in the steps of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For many, like myself, too ill or otherwise unable to make the journey to join those fortunate ones experiencing this lectures series in person, this serves as 'the next best thing', and a profound blessing and a deeply moving (to the point of tears in many cases) testiment and testimony to our hearts, minds, and souls, of the Tremendous Truth and Living Love of our wonderful Lord God.
I have watched these lessons countless times; they never get old (how could God's Message get old?), and my wife and I have given or loaned out many copies through the years to others who were similarly blessed.
My review for each volume of this series will remain unchanged for each and every one, for any indepth review will be inadequate to convey that which is contained within; like someone who sees a work of art who does not have the words to adequately describe, or to do justice to, this masterpiece, all I can do is urge you to come and partake of this blessing and let the scriptures come alive within you once again!",1328227200,3,2305,4.820707070707071

2777019,5,B000NOKRF6,"I think this is a great video series to sit and watch over and over. Ray Vander Laan is so informative. You not only journey to the popular Bibical cities and towns, he takes you to the out of the way places, places you would not normaly go to on a popular tour. You feel like your taking the journey with the group. It's a greay way of seeing and learning about Israel, Jesus and that time period without actually being there.",1315612800,,427,4.219512195121951
2777020,5,B000NOKRF6,Excellent series. Have watched 10 of the series now and for those who want a better understanding of the Bible almost a must. Very practical in its application.,1303257600,,160,4.75
2777021,5,B000NOKRF6,"This DVD series is great for personal growth, small or large group bible studies, and is a useful way
to grow in your faith by expanding on well known bible stories. The historian/teacher, Ray Vander Laan,
is excellent and so are the videos, except for one that was made in a cave with very low light. I would
definitely recommend this series to anyone interested in Christian history and in growing in their faith!",1296172800,,415,4.621621621621622
2777022,5,B000NOKRF6,The insights and video footage are inspiring and enlightening. The lessons are nicely paced and focused.,1287792000,4,104,5.5625
2777023,5,B000NOKRF6,I am a seller here on Amazon (Faithfilms) and I sell these dvds.  Only recently have I begun to watch them and I must say they are wonderful.  My dream someday is to go to Israel and the Middle East.  Ray Vander Laan is a unique and incredible speaker/Bible teacher.  The photography is beautiful with breathtaking aerial views.  It would take many trips to Israel to see all that he packs into these dvds.  You are also taken to out of the ordinary Biblical sites.  These are dvds that I hope to have time to watch at least a couple times over again - they are full of so much.,1281398400,8,578,4.2
2777024,5,B000NOKRF6,"Ray VanderLaan does an outstanding job of bringing the Bible to life.  Right in front of your eyes, every story comes to life.  With an outstanding knowledge of the archeology of Israel and its surrounding territories, Ray is able to bring to life so many things.  I highly recommend this series.  Its very educational and will enhance any study of the Bible.",1273708800,17,359,4.741935483870968

2777026,5,B000NOKRF6,"The way Ray Vander Laan describes the landscape and culture of the time helps the pages of the Bible come alive. Someone told me about this series after my first trip to Israel so when I made the second trip it was even more special knowing the background story.  Whenever I am hungering for Eretz Yisrael, I pop in one of these DVDs just to see the places I've been so many times now and to glean yet more nuggets of truth from this awesome teacher.  You won't regret purchasing this DVD set.",1266883200,5,493,4.290322580645161
2777027,5,B000NOKRF6,"These teachings from Ray Vander Laan are AWESOME!  There is no other word for it.  He really makes the bible come alive and relevant for today.  The teaching on Masada alone is worth the price!

Despite the griping of the above reviewer, who seems to be upset that the DVDs haven't arrived and who therefore isn't commenting about the DVDs themselves, but about the poor service he is receiving, these DVDs will make a great addition to your library.",1253750400,9,450,4.658227848101266
2777028,4,B000NOKRF6,"This is an amazing historical and spiritual journey that incorporates visual and teaching elements that I've not encountered done nearly as effectively as it is done here.  Occasionally you may find some of the ""faith lessons"" a bit overly fundamental but this is rare and should not prevent someone from getting all there is good in this for those few moments - it is the only reason I gave it a four stars instead of five.",1236038400,13,424,4.578947368421052
2777029,5,B000NOKRF6,"I lived in Israel for 6 months and have visited several countries in this region and went to just about every place in these videos.  Ray Vander Laan does a great job of showing these places as they really are and giving a reasonable explanation on how the places came to be in the state that they are.  Then he ties it in with a Biblical lesson.

Reading the Bible has never been so interesting since going to Israel.  If you can't do that, watch these videos.  It will change your life.",1214870400,32,488,4.260869565217392

8180305,5,B000NOKRF6,I have been to Israel twice years ago.

I pray that I can find and purchase the other 5 lessons.,1385424000,,258,4.03921568627451

8180307,5,B000NOKRF6,"When he graduated from seminary, Ray Vander Laan was given a gift by a relative -- a chance to study the Bible (Old Testament) in Isreal with rabbis.  The experience changed the way Mr Vander Laan looked a the Bible and he started offering tours to students and others during summer breaks.  The participants saw first-hand the places Jesus and His disciples lived, worked, visited and learned to understand the culture as these key Bible figures experienced it.  These tours became extraordinarily popular and Mr Vander Laan couldn't meet the demand on his time.  This set of DVD's is a recreation of those tours and that wonderful teaching.  Ray Vander Laan is a compelling speaker and each lesson stands alone or compliments others in the set.  Since each of the DVD's comes with a teacher's guide, anyone interested in sharing these lessons as a Bible study has all he or she will need and, since each segment is only 20 minutes, it's easy to present to an adult learner.  Worth the time and money.",1378857600,9,1002,4.724137931034483
8180308,5,B000NOKRF6,"The DVDs are well produced, beautifully photographed, and highly informative. We used one of the 7 in our Vacation Bible School since we were learning about discipleship. Even the smaller children were interested and the adults were captivated.",1378598400,,244,5.447368421052632
