1971848,3,B00015EDMK,"To be brief, this DVD is still worth buying for the great singing and sound quality. The production is terrible----- another example of cheap modern eurotrash. The whole ambience is cold, unlike the magical fantasy of the Met/ Vienna production which should be taped instead. It is cheaper than to buy the full CD set anyway. So just turn off the TV screen and enjoy !",1084233600,7,368,4.590909090909091
1971849,1,B00015EDMK,"I can not express myself in English as well as I  would like to
completely disagree with the above reviewers of this outrageous
production od Dvorak's beautiful opera. I respect their right to
have liked it but I must present the opinion of the majority of
traditional opera lovers who think that opera producers and direc
tors do not have the right to change the composers' intentions.
It is a pity that such wonderful singers consented to participate
in this monstruous deformation of an opera dealing with a world
of fantasy. This is a recording to be heard and not seen. To my eye it is hateful, indecent, ugly and boring and what one sees
has nothing to do with what the singers are saying. It is worse
than Salzburg's productions of Les Troyens, La Damnation de Faust
and Turandot. Francesca Zambello's production of Les Troyens for
the Met. Opera and War and Peace for Paris are bothe modern and
not traditional but they still respect the composers' creations.
  Think well before spending your money in this DVD. If you want
to hear Ren&eacute;e Flemming in this beautiful opera buy the CD set.

1971850,5,B00015EDMK,"The is the only Rusalka DVD available in original Czech. And it boasts Renee Fleming in the title role.
As usual, she is magnificent. And it is great to see her in addition to hearing her. In general, I find her singing more dramatic and less silkily beautiful than in her celebrated recording under Mackerras(Decca). This is probably what one would expect from a live performance. The other singers are all great, with Sergei Larin as the prince, Franz Hawlata as the watersprite, Larissa Diadkova as Jezibaba and Eva Urbanova as the foreign princess. The orchestra under James Conlon performs ably.
The set and direction are very modern and to these eyes somewhat controversial. But they are interesting, effective and totally valid.
The audience is very well behaved(or some applauses are edited out?), bursting into applause, justifiably, after the famous first act ""Mesicku ..."" aria, but before the agitated orchestral lead-out, which I felt disrupts the flow slightly.
The film direction is well done in the most part. The camera occasionally lets you see how a scene change is done, which leaves you wondering what the audience in Bastille was actually seeing at other scene changes where the camera ""naturally"" cuts from one scene to another.
There are very minor cuts to the score. The one I noticed were the solos by the 3 wood nymphs before their trio in the third act.
I don't have a 5.1 system yet, so I cannot comment on the surround sound, but at least the stereo sound is very good.
All in all, the DVD is well worth having.

1971851,5,B00015EDMK,"Dvor&aacute;k's 'Rusalka' is by far his most effective opera and the only one that has made its way in the non-Slavic world. Based on de la Motte Fouqu&eacute;'s fairytale, 'Ondine,' but with additions from Hans Christian Andersen and the Czech ballads of K. J. Erben, and with a symbolist libretto by Jaroslav Kvapil, Dvor&aacute;k's music captures the story's ecstasy and anguish perfectly. Briefly, it is the story of a water nymph who falls in love with a Prince who visits the lake where she, her three sisters and her father, the Water Spirit, live. She wishes to become mortal so she can be with him and implores the witch, Jezibaba, to grant her that wish. Jezibaba does so but with two provisos: she will become human but lose the power of speech, and if her lover rejects her she will be forever cursed. Well, the Prince initially loves her but, dismayed by her muteness, is soon won over by the blandishments  of the evil Foreign Princess, so Rusalka, with her father's help, flees back to the water world. Jezibaba tells her that her only way of extracting revenge is to kill human males by kissing them and when the Prince, who has seen the error of his ways, comes to reclaim her, she warns him (having gotten back her voice) that she cannot come with him because her kiss would be fatal. He says that to 'die upon a kiss' would be the only way he could ever attain peace. They sing a rapturous duet, she kisses him and he dies. Curtain.
Rusalka is a signature role for Ren&eacute;e Fleming; her audio recording of the opera six years ago was a huge hit. This production, from the Paris Op&eacute;ra, conducted by James Conlon, followed in 2002. The direction of Robert Carsen and set and costume design by Michael Levine emphasize the duality and symmetry of the mortal and fairy worlds. In Act I, which takes place at the bottom of the enchanted lake, the stage set is designed with a vertical symmetry, rather like the reflections seen at the water's surface when one is submerged. In Act II, which occurs in a stylized palace, there is left-right symmetry with the singers on the left side and mute actors mirroring them on the right side. Quite effective, if sometimes unintentionally reminiscent of the famous mirror act done by Groucho and Harpo Marx. Still, it conveys visually the mirroring of the real and fairytale worlds whose inability to merge leads to the final tragedy.
The musical presentation is spectacularly good. Fleming, of course, is superb. Her two main arias, the famous 'Hymn to the Moon' and the Act III 'Vyrvana zivotu"" (""I am torn from life"") are stunningly beautiful. Her ecstatic final duet with the Prince, sung by Sergei Larin, is equally marvelous. Larin is in very good voice and has the requisite heft to manage the almost Wagnerian tenor role as the Prince. There is not a single weak member of the rest of the cast. Huge-voiced basso Franz Hawlata is touching as Rusalka's father, the Water Spirit. Larissa Diadkova is properly impish as the comic witch, Jezibaba. Eva Urbanova, strangely the only Czech in the cast of this quintessential Czech opera, is scary as the evil Foreign Princess. The three Wood Nymphs, as Wagnerian a trio as one can find outside the 'Ring,' are well done by Michelle Canniccioni, Svetlana Lifar and Nona Javakhidze. The Kitchen Boy, a pants role, is well-done by Karine DeHayes. It is particularly gratifying to see and hear the venerable French tenor, Michel S&eacute;n&eacute;chal, as the Gamekeeper.  The Act II ballet, neatly carrying forward the mirror-image theme of the production, was crisply choreographed by Philippe Giraudeau and danced by the corps of the Op&eacute;ra Ballet. The video direction was by Franois Roussillon; it is unobtrusive and natural.
I was both charmed and intrigued by this production. 'Rusalka' is slowly becoming better known throughout the world and I suspect this DVD of the Paris production will help further its spread.
Recommended.

1971872,4,B00015EDMK,"First of all, I am by and large a traditionalist as far as opera staging. I want my Hansel and Gretel to wear leiderhosen and pigtails, I want to see the women in sumptuous costumes, and I want my ""Ballo In Maschera"" to be about Gustav III of 1792. Having said this, I don't think this ""Rusalka"" is the worst crime against nature. If they had also butchered the music, perhaps I would be harsher on it, but I happen to think that a production is salvageable for posterity if the music is taken seriously.

I can't say it enough: 5 stars for the singers, 5 stars for the orchestra and conductor, 5 stars for the acting. I'm too confused by the staging to really decide on a verdict.

I loved the singers enough to put up with the staging. I loved the water effects and the subsequent lighting of water. Yes, it's confusing that the women are all in floppy white nightgowns, and even more confusing that the men are in perfectly-pressed suits, but I can think of worse things to do to an opera. The music is taken seriously, the staging is not. I suppose some people could argue that a goofy staging negates music or even the composer's intentions in general, but that seems like a harsh thing to say considering the quality of the music here. There are some very fine singers assembled together in this production, and the acting caliber is also rather good. Some people here are saying to just get the CD version instead and enjoy the audio glory. Maybe so, but I do think that seeing characters' reactions and interactions helped me glean quite a lot more in this case (sorry, not all of us speak Czech or can commit an entire libretto *and* its meaning to memory). Fleming is a very fine Rusalka, and the rest of the cast lend just the right mix of quirkiness, quiet nobility, and emotion. This one is, admittedly, not steeped in old fairy tales or old Slavic superstitions, but the ending is still an odd blend of creepy and bittersweet.",1372377600,,1940,4.461971830985916
1971873,3,B00015EDMK,"I have no problem with the musical aspect of this performance of Dvorak's magnificent opera, but I have dinged this production two stars for the contemporary sets and costumes. The opera is a fairy tale, after all, and there's nothing to suggest that here. Particularly off-putting was the large, bland bed-room set that dominates the long second act and serves as the forest and the castle. The pomp and ceremony of the procession is suggested only by the music with nothing visual to support it. The odd modern dance number in the middle served no purpose that I could divine. Sergei Larkin as the Prince is serviceable, but I found myself wishing he had Ben Heppner's voice from the CD recording. Fleming is Fleming. Hawlata and Diadkova both delivered the goods. All in all, this DVD is worth the trouble largely for the music, but was less than satisfying visually. Unfortunately there seems not much else available that would be an improvement.",1356134400,4,950,4.87037037037037
1971874,4,B00015EDMK,"I love this opera, though I am not certain that I love the modern interpretation. The voices they chose for this production are excellent, of course. I could listen to Rene Fleming sing the moon song all day (and I may have done so at least once or twice). The sound is not the HD sound that I would like to hear, but it's not bad.",1345939200,,331,4.03030303030303

1971876,3,B00015EDMK,"This is a reissue of the 2002 version of the Opera National Paris production. It's a delightful opera, melodic and pleasing music based on folksongs and life-motives. The singers are all very good, especially Renee Fleming, who was at the height of her art that time. It is however a pain to see how the director, Robert Carsen made a trash out of the production: he placed the story, which is about a folklore playing out in the forest and inthe Prince's castle, into a stark bedroom. Instead of the dances at the ball, what the music describes, Carsen organizes an ugly mad-scene among a bunch of people, stripping each other.

If you want to see such trashy production, go and buy the old [issued by TDK in 2004] version at $5.00, rather then this one at $ 30.00.",1343692800,4,766,4.510791366906475
1971877,4,B00015EDMK,"John Cahill has written an excellent and detailed review of the performance and production, so I see little point in reiterating his words. But I do think the unique nature of the production can benefit from some emphasis.

As I always say in my opera reviews, one thing that I think is of paramount importance, is that all aspects of the production must make a united whole, and not, like some, just a showpiece for a famous singer. Here, we are lucky to have both, as Fleming, (who I understand, prefers traditional productions) fits into this psychologically motivated performance with no appearance of being presented as the ""STAR"" attraction. If you are unfamiliar with this work, I feel it is a contender for Dvorak's greatest achievement. Although there are definite arias, the work is really continuous, extraordinarily beautiful melody from start to finish.

The story is a subtle one, and productions like that from the Met. (I have given up on Met performances, they rely too much on showcase extravagance, and the video production usually detracts from the opera) entirely miss out on the significant psychology in this story. When the opera started, I thought the set was terrible. But, as the story unfolded, and it's surface simplicity became apparent as a vehicle for something with much greater depth, so the set, lighting,  the detailed mirrored movement on the stage (for much of the opera, the action takes place on a set divided down the middle, and action is mirrored between left and right of the stage). You should make up your own mind on this staging, but it certainly relates to the psychological aspects of the story. And the ballet is the most extraordinarily creative work I have ever seen. Not long, but it conveys much.

With the DVD, engineering allowed a greater presentation of the environment of a water nymph, giving the viewer a superior result than I imagine the theatre audience would have seen.and it almost seems as if the DVD was the final aim for this production. Unfortunately, at least on my 2-disc set (it is a long opera with Act 3 on a second disc; but it doesn't drag, you want more) the physical DVD was poorly manufactured, In many ways, the image was sharp and able to handle rich color almost to Blu-ray quality, but I found dark areas just merging into an amorphous blackness with no grey-shades at all. I'm afraid I don't know the term for this technical flaw. Also, there was something wrong with the set-up options, with a tendency to freeze when trying to select audio and sub-title options. And this was tried on five players, three DVD and two Blu-ray, with costs ranging from budget to very expensive. Once underway, there was only the problem with dark areas. Fortunately, the audio is essentially flawless.

I have wandered a bit from my original intention of emphasizing that this was a rare and very beautiful opera, given a superb performance all round (OK, one minor role could have been sung a little better, but this is carping); but quite different to any opera I know. Strangely, and I guess most might not agree with this, but I had a feeling of influence from Wagner, but not so deep, and more immediately appealing. The producers have seized on the unique quality of the work, and come up with a unique DVD presentation. It won't appeal to all, but for those prepared to take on something unusually creative, there are many rewards.

Don't let this description of the deeper aspects of the work turn you away. Just buy it and enjoy some of the most beautiful music, singing and acting presented most imaginatively, in a way that is a rare experience. Congratulations are also due to James Conlon's musical direction, and the excellent playing of the Paris Opera Orchestra. This is my second Rusalka, the first being from a production for TV recorded in 1961. It's age removes it from the sparse competition. A pity it isn't on Blu-ray, but I think the technical problems with the vision made that out of the question.

Well, here I am, verbose as usual, but please, don't miss this one. (Oh. Only four stars because of the poor video engineering, and the testing was done on a very high-quality system.)",1320796800,3,4178,4.762430939226519
1971878,1,B00015EDMK,"I bought this DVD when it first came out.  I was a little hesitant about purchasing it because the production is by Robert Carsen whose productions of operas are just trashy!! However, the singing is just wonderful by all the main characters, but the sets and production are just plain awful!  Where is the beautiful lake in the woods at the beginning of the opera and particularly at the end??  There the Prince dies after kissing Rusalka and she sinks below the waters of the lake.  Why are they in a motel room at the end!!! It looks like a Motel Six room (with apologies to Motel Six). Where is the beautiful Prince's Palace???  I saw the MET production in New York with Fleming - it was glorious and thrilling to see and hear, and the final scene was beautifully done.  I would hope that the MET would put this out on DVD, but it may not have been filmed.  Too bad.  I don't recommend anyone purchasing this current DVD - buy the CD instead and listen to the glorious music!  You will be glad you did.",1294099200,11,1006,4.336898395721925
1971879,5,B00015EDMK,"The musical performance seems pretty much flawless, at least it seems to me.  Fleming may hold one or two notes a bit too long, just because she can, but her overall interpretation is charming as well as vocally perfect.  The Jezibaba and Vodnik have sung their roles all over the world and deliver here.  Larin, the Prince, can be a bit less convincing as an actor, but he manages the difficult big moments for his character without strain. The sound quality of the DVD and the conductor are excellent.

The production is a modern, reinterpretive one, and a very successful one at that, from the Paris Opera. It is a psychological slant on Rusalka, with the staging seemingly suggesting that Rusalka, The Foreign Princess, and Jezibaba are all different aspects of the same woman, mainly by means of matching costumes and by having characters move as reflections of each other in mirrors. The ending is reconceived as a happy one, a new beginning for Rusalka and the Prince.  The sets are incredibly attractive, although spare, and the lighting is striking.  The DVD's picture is excellent and detailed, with rich, bright photography, even in some fairly dark (interms of the stage lighting) scenes.

I have 2 dvds of Rusalka, this one and the English National Opera one with Eileen Hannan. They are both modern productions, and similar in interpreting Rusalka as a story about the difficulty of achieving maturity and breaking away from from one's parents.  They are both excellent, but I have to admit, I would like to see something different.  I am hoping the recent Glyndebourne production or some other will be released on DVD soon.",1262390400,10,1638,4.884476534296029
1971880,5,B00015EDMK,"This is a gorgeous production with an amazing performance by Renee Fleming. If you don't know Dvorak's opera, this is the best introduction you could have. A symbolist play representative of a rather kinky society (Nothing like a mermaid's kiss to take your breath away!), Dvorak's work is pleasurably melodic, with wonderful supporting harmonies.",1260230400,4,347,5.444444444444445
1971881,2,B00015EDMK,"Rusalka is among my favorite operas - Dvorak did a wonderful job composing the music to fit beautifully with the plot and the fantasty elements. I have the Fleming CD, and I thankfully did not buy this DVD. I borrowed it from the library, thinking I would at least enjoy it, even if it was imperfect. Giving this DVD two stars is generous. A fairly traditional staging is all that can work with Rusalka; it is a fantasy, set in what is almost another world. As soon as Rusalka's father entered wearing a suit, I knew the production would not be to my liking. It was about halfway through the opera that I realized I would actually hate it. Many portions of the opera become almost entirely nonsensical because the libretto does not match what's happening on stage. The simplistic staging could work for other operas, but Rusalka is a piece of fantasy that deserves better than what this director gave it. The extra star in my review is merely because of the music itself. Not recommended at all",1252195200,7,994,4.558659217877095
1971892,5,B00015EDMK,"[This is a reissue on the Arthaus Musik label of a production of 'Rusalka' previously issued on TDK which I reviewed in 2004. It is, as far as I can tell, identical with the earlier DVD. I append my earlier review.]

1971893,1,B00015EDMK,"The music was beyond reproach and the performers well cast. So why the one star? An opera, to me, is a story set by the composer in a setting of time and place. It is a visual and audial work of love where sound and sight are carefully joined to achieve the composer's purpose. Dvorak's beautiful fairy tale has been sacrificed to some giant ego who has completely disregarded Dvorak's setting. The opera is a fairy tale with dark woods, wood nymphs, a water goblin, a prince and princess and the protagonist who is a water nymph. How can it be set in a stark room with electric lights and a double bed? The prince comes seeking ""the white doe"" through the ""woods"" in a suit, topcoat and derby!! The only way I could get through this unpleasantness was to close my eyes often and just listen to the music. As another reviewer has said, buy the audio CD of Rene Fleming as Rusulka.",1238371200,46,880,4.371951219512195
1971894,5,B00015EDMK,"Thanks to movies and TV there are thousands of people who know the soprano's aris from the first act. I wonder how many people who have bought a CD of the complete opera were able to keep at the entire score. Certainly it pays off with repeated listenings but Dvorak's own assessment of this gifts for the stage were probably correct: he was not a natural born opera composer.

I had a CD of the opera but truth to tell I was rarely inspired to take it down and listen to it. With the death of Larin I thought perhaps I have unfairly ignored the work, afteall even the Met has seen fit to mount it--probably because of Fleming. The Carsen production doesn't do the work any favors, but is not offputting to me, and I find it more acceptable than his Paris Opera Hoffman. For those who demand a setting more appropriate be warned: this is about as far from a sylvan milleau as you can get. Fortunately the singing is of a very high order. Larin's death robbed the opera world of an attractive spinto tenor. There is no doubt that his voice is hardly as melifluous as Ben Heppner's on the CD but his physique du role more than makes up for sheer beauty of tone. Fleming has always been a puzzlement to me. Optimum beauty of tone and face seem to be rarely coupled with optimum intelligence and a gift for stage characterization. Her most egregious performance is Capriccio in which she is merely content to be Renee Fleming. The updating of the production should not have deterred her from characterizing the Countess but either she doesn't care or can't find any reason to find an ""inner"" life in her character. As Rusalka (a role she has claimed as her favorite) she gives far and away her best dramatic performance; that it is vocally superior is a given. As to her Czech pronunciation I am unable to comment. The two Russians, Didakova and Larin, obviously are more at one with the idiom and Hawlata has such a gorgeous voice that one would have to be churlish to make a complaint. The one native, Eva Urbanova, has some of the faults that characterize Slavic singers--in the past. But her performance is not a deal breaker (the production probably is for most) and the role is not that large.

I believe that the only competition of a film with Czech singers. I have not seen it, but I have such an antipathy to lip-synching that it would never make my ""short list"".",1209772800,,2369,4.456221198156682

1971896,5,B00015EDMK,"Rusalka is one of my favourite Czech operas. Dvorak's scoring is magnificent; edging towards the Wagnerian side of the scale; combining light and lyrical with dramatic overtones. The cast is impeccable. Commencing with Renee Fleming in one of her greatest roles to date and her support cast members are strong enough to match her. Sergei Larin's helder-tenor voice ripe for the picking. Laisssa Diadkova has always been a favourite of mine and here she displays why, both vocally and artistically. Franz Hawlata's large basso voice gives the Water Sprite that little bit of menace. The three wood nymphs of Michelle Canniccioni; Svetlana Lifar & Nona Javakhide are extremely powerful and remind me of the three Rhine Maidens from Das Rhinegold of Wager's Ring Cycle. Eva Urbanova makes a chilling Foreign Princess, the remainder of the cast match these. The Act ll Ballet is stunning as is the orchestral playing of the National Paris Opera Orchestra under the direction of James Conlon. Now we come to the staging: I can see where Michael Levine is coming from, but I do NOT agree with his decision or vision. Come on, what has happened to traditional set design? Who do these so called modern designers think they are! The composer and lyricist have developed a story/theme, why not stick to it. After all it has survived since its inception. How would you feel if the conductor wanted to play around with the music and add bits of his own? Would that be acceptable? So why change the design so that no one, other, than the designer knows where the opera is set.
This is a beautiful opera destroyed by an over egotistical designer who thinks he knows best. If he insists on these weird designs, then he should write an opera to go with it.
I have a saying: if it ain't broke, don't fix it; and that applies to operatic staging.",1191024000,5,1829,4.736677115987461

1971898,5,B00015EDMK,"I have read all the reviews and accept 99.9% of what has already been said.  This DVD recording of ""Rusalka"" is truly, ""A work to die for!""

I, too, bought this film because of Renee Fleming; having heard her Hymn to the Moon on various CD recordings.  As for Dvorak, familiarity with his symphonic works were always impressive.  The great surprise was the powerful score of Dvorak' Rusalka---almost Wagnerian.  Wagner's influence on Dvorak is very much evident; yet Dvorak retains his individuality.  Opera and any music for that matter which makes one think, ponder, and emote is worthy to be called great music.  Opera, of course, holds the trump card because it embodies all art forms. Dvorak's score powerfully holds the continuity of this work.

 And WHAT ART in this production of Rusalka!  Just to see and hear Renee Fleming  sing  Rusalka's Hymn to the Moon alone on stage in this magnificent setting is worth the price of the DVD.

5 Stars are not enough to honor all those involved in this production.  I'm still pondering and emoting.",1168300800,6,1046,4.803370786516854
1971899,5,B00015EDMK,"I thought this was a gorgeous production, and was riveted from start to finish.  Sometimes I get the ""Eurotrashing"" comments, some times I don't.  In this case, I don't see it at all.  I see a production of an opera based on a fairy tale where the sets and staging truly serve an artistic purpose.  In my opinion, it is a production that Opera National de Paris should be proud of.  I loved all of the sets, and loved the use of the ""mirror image"" staging to illustrate the duality of Rusalka's existence.  The lighting was stunning.

Another thing I like about this production is the number of singers I am not familiar with.  Truth be told, the only two in the cast I had heard are Renee Fleming and Eva Urbanova.  I spend a lot of time with opera singers, none of whom you have heard of.  One thing I've learned over time is this: there are plenty of great singers that will never be known to the general opera public.  This production will demonstrate that to you in spades.

The opening scene of this opera set the tone perfectly.  The three nymphs (Rusalka's sisters) are cavorting in the water.  The staging was playful and credible.  The use of water onstage was a very nice touch.  The set was vast, but sparse, making the nymphs look even tinier.  And what nymphs they were!  Michelle Canniccioni, Svetlana Lifar, and Nona Javakhidze were fabulous.  They sang beautifully, with gorgeous ensemble.  They also looked the parts, beautiful and innocent, dressed in simple white gowns.

Their cavorting is eventually halted by the entrance of their father, the Water Spirit.  His foreboding black suit and stern look gave way to a kind man, who proceeded to play with his daughters.  As the Water Spirit, we have the fabulous baritone Franz Hawlata.  What a great instrument he has, and what disciplined technique.  Nothing is forced, and every vowel lines up.  He delives some of the best singing in the production.

I also loved Larissa Diadkova as the witch Jezibaba.  Her mezzo has a real presence.  In addition to her wonderful arias and ensemble singing, she was a convincing actress.  She's definitely a good witch.  Not such a nice person is the Foreign Princess who underhandedly steals the Prince from our Rusalka.  This juicy part is very well sung by Eva Urbanova.  You may boo and hiss her actions, but you'll cheer her singing and strong characterization.  The Prince is capably sung by Sergei Larin.  His death at the end of the opera was very well done.  Plus, it's good that not only sopranos get to die on stage!

The reason I bought this DVD is to see and hear the magnificent Renee Fleming in this signature role.  All I can say is Wow!  Her two big arias (""Song to the Moon"" and ""I am torn from life"") are characteristic Renee.  The set and lighting for ""Song to the Moon"" was just beautiful; simple, elegant, and supportive.  Nothing in the set, staging, or lighting detracted from this, one of the most beautiful and moving arias in the lyric soprano rep. Renee's silky voice has plenty of great legato, full dynamic range, and outstanding register matching.  Every single note has integrity.  She can shape a phrase like nobody's business.  Renee is also a fine actress, and a beautiful, elegant woman.  I particularly enjoyed the scene where she is losing the Prince because she can't speak.  The last scene and duet with the Prince is beautiful and poignant.

But the real star of this opera is the music by the great Antonin Dvorak.  This opera can stand up to any opera.  Dvorak was a brilliant composer who, like Beethoven, bridged the gap between Classical and Romantic. He's a lot bigger than the New World Symphony.  The music is played with great sensitivity and energy by the orchestra of the Opera National de Paris, assertively conducted by James Conlon.

I hope that all opera lovers will make it a priority to own this DVD.  Not only is it a beautiful production, it is a performance record of one of the finest lyric sopranos of all time singing a signature role.  Renee is one of our generation's greatest blessings.

Highly recommended!",1167696000,11,4082,4.666666666666667

1971901,4,B00015EDMK,"As I was watching the first act of Robert Carsen's production of Dvorak's ""Rusalka"" for l'Opera de Paris, I couldn't help thinking how much M. Night Shyamalan would love it, given that the set looks like the bottom of a swimming pool.  Then again, it inexplicably switches to what looks like a very large hotel room, so perhaps Paris Hilton is the target audience. (Where, oh, where is this forest The Prince keeps singing about?)...Ah the Land of Eurotrash (in this case Canadian) Opera Directors, where their artistic ""vision"" completely obliterates that of those pesky little people known as the composer and librettist. At least Carsen has a unique eye for the stylish, and he pretty much keeps out of the way of his singers.  And what singers they are!  The voices here are uniformally superb, starting with the glorious Renee Fleming, performing here one of her signature roles.  Her supporting cast, particularly Sergei Larin and the remarkable Franz Hawlata shine no less than she, and they all do yeoman's service in ignoring the silliness around them.  I guess we can be grateful that somebody bothered to film Fleming in this role, but I personally would have preferred a less pretentious approach.  (And some explanatory notes from Carsen would have been greatly appreciated in the DVD booklet!)",1155168000,12,1307,5.0
1971902,5,B00015EDMK,"I am in the new generation of opera singers and lovers.  I'm always looking for new artistic productions and interpretations on stage.  This production of Rusalka could be most perfectly explained as sheerly beautiful!  Some don't like its mildly complex staging, but I believe that its open for vast interpretation  That's why its awesome.

These are a few of my thoughts about the meaning:

We see a small pool on stage about 2 or 3 inches in depth in the beginning, representing the lake that Rusalka and her sisters live.  Remember, Rusalka is a water sprite, NOT a mermaid, as many people seem to think.  Water sprites have the ability to walk on water, so this makes more since as they begin to splash around ""on top"" of the water.

Secondly, Rusalka's Father, who is dressed in a formal black business suit, is dressed this way (I believe) to represent a powerful force over the lake and its inhabitants.  Its like ""Daddy's coming home to his little girls after a day of work.""  The bed over the water represents the land, which is ""out of reach"" to the girls in their sprite form.  Of course, the bed lowers as Rusalka becomes a woman.

As far as the ""mirror scene"" is concerned, this is left up to interpretation, but becomes more symbolic as Rusalka and the new Princess ""trade places"".  Then we begin to understand why the mirror had to be there.  Also, think of each side representing something: One is a world wanted and craved, the other a plain reality.

The dance sequence is something that needs to be thought about.  Its essentially the entire story from beginning to end (more or less) in a dance.  Notice the gestures that Rusalka makes as if she is choking, and see that same gesture mirrored in the female dancers.  The stripping of their dresses is essentially the stripping of many things: life, happiness, and her ideal world.

I think that Robert Carsen did a remarkable job with this production.  In addition, the singing of ALL of the characters is quite amazing.  Renee's interpretation of ""Song to the Moon"" is sung with the warmest of legato lines and caresses the soul like velvet.  Truly one of her signature roles! I love the three sisters in the beginning for their musicianship and energy.  But Larissa Diadkova as Jezibaba is really something to hear.  Her dark Mezzo voice is like Chocolate, with a hint of spice.  Sergei Larin as the Prince gives a fascinating performance as well.

I highly recommend this production to any opera lover, if anything, just for something different. If you watch it with an open mind, I think that it has the ability to become a favorite in your collection.  It did in mine!!!",1152403200,9,2646,4.65658747300216

1971904,3,B00015EDMK,"When the character of the Watersprite emerges from the lake wearing suit and tie, overcoat and fedora one can only despair. Despite fine singing (if not memorable) the production is ludicrous and, in my opinion, stupid. The festive ball scene is a grotesque and downright ugly ballet. All of the magic of this wonderful Slavic fairy tale is gone in this weird production. Unfortunately, this is typical of what is being perpetrated in Europe today.

Thanks to inspired to performances by a stellar cast, making this fairy tale into a modern allegory of betrayed innocence works. Fleming and Larin sing and act beautifully.

 This production is incredibly intllegent and beautiful. Renee is AMAZING! But it is the director, Robert Carsen, who has outdone himself. This production trancends traditional produtions and reveals something that is, at once, cerebral and heartfelt. This production provokes your attention from the first note and never let's you go.

 Isn't that what opera should do?

 Seriously, do you really need to see another traditional production that you could easily imagine in your mind as you listen to the recording? Come on, we've all seen Disney's The Little Mermaid!

 This production keeps you guessing and engaged for more than 2 hours, while Dvorak's score is performed with incredibly artistry and commitment.

Fleming, Hawlata (as the water goblin) and the wood nymphs are particularly beautiful. I hadn't realized how good Fleming is until seeing this performance. Don't hesitate to buy this recording.
On the other hand... This is a matter of taste I realize, but I really prefer traditional, realistic staging for a work like this. The production is interesting. It seems to be making a point about the surface between the water and earthly worlds. The sets are full of mirrors, reflections, even doppelgangers. They're physically beautiful, and the production is less ridiculous than many conceptualist distortions of 19th-century operas, but still, I would have preferred a traditional design. This is irritating to me, but I can ""tune it out"" and enjoy the music thoroughly. It does appear to me that, as tastes develop, we are seeing fewer of these essentially egocentric production designs. The cult of the conductor is also in decline I hope.

""His stagings have become landmarks of 20th century opera, theatre and ballet history"", it seems almost inconceivable that anyone would have the cheek to stage a production of Rusalka like this. More heiniously, by what authority (other than articstic license) does one tinker with the libretto of  an exquisitely crafted opera to the degree that it becomes as insipid as the final episode of ""The Real Housewives of Tulsa"".

For those of  you who were introduced to Dvorak's masterpiece,  the prince betrays Rusalka who has made a Faustian bargain with a witch.
He is stricken with remorse and even though Rusalka warns him if she delivers the kiss that he needs to knowhe has been forgiven, he will die.
Rusalka yields to his entreaties for the kiss that will bring him piece from his torment and the Prince dies in her arms. while, with beatific sweetness, she thanks him for allowing her to experience human love. But  Rusalka is doomed and she descends to the depths of the lake for eternity for her ""sin"" to Dvorak's final chords which slash at your heart like a dagger . As the final strains of the music fade away, a beautiful moon hangs suspended over the still lake.

I can't think of any thing else to say. Renee fleming is a Goddess and a cheeky woman who is not afraid to push the envelope. I wonder still what she thinks of this slaughtering of the crown jewell in Dvorak's operatic repetoire.",1421107200,,1540,4.622710622710622
