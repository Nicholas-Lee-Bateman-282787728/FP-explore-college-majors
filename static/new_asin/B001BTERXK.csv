3498955,5,B001BTERXK,"What a grand film. Yes, the film makers took some freedoms with journalistic truth in having the father Giuseppe share a prison cell with his son, but they made a dramatic point well, and they did not deviate far from the significant facts. The son stayed in prison with the father and it was hell.
A hell imposed by a police legal conspiracy in response to a terrorist campaign.
Still relevant in these present days of terrorist attacks and police and judicial misbehavior.
Of course the performances are stunning.
I only wish the film makers had engaged Black 47 instead of Bono and U2 but hey that is show biz.
A great movie.",1463097600,,628,4.566371681415929

3498967,5,B001BTERXK,"A most compelling film that should be required viewing in the age of Trump, ""In the Name of the Father"" tells of a miscarriage of justice in the aftermath of terrorism.  Daniel Day-Lewis brilliantly portrays the alienation and at times the fatalism of the lead character, innocent though no choir-boy, and Emma Thompson is wonderful as his principled and passionate attorney.  Other characters are vividly etched.  This would be memorable entertainment if it weren't also much more.",1458950400,,482,5.233766233766234

3498969,5,B001BTERXK,"This movie is outstanding. It's a hard beginning with the violence in the streets and other situations but otherwise it's a two thumbs up. I'm not a die hard fan of Sir Daniel Day-Lewis (yes he's been knighted) but I began to admire him greatly when I did the miniature marathon. Can you imagine getting arrested for a crime you didn't commit? I would feel heartbroken if that was the case for me. It was ranked #6 on the list of Top 10 Daniel Day-Lewis Performances. On my list, it would be #3. I actually bought this in German (with French & Italian) and I can't wait for it to come home. It seems like Day-Lewis and Jim Sheridan were frequent collaborators with being My Left Foot and The Boxer. I highly recommend it to everyone.",1458259200,,733,4.397058823529412

The relationship between Jerry Conlon and his father is also quite touching.

3499063,5,B001BTERXK,"A riveting mostly true story of injustice dealt by the hands of police officers eager to exact revenge in response to well warranted public outrage, and pressure from their superiors, over the Guilford pub bombings southwest of London on October 4, 1975.

Unfortunately, such illicit and immoral activities by police, as is too frequently the case, results in lengthy terms of imprisonment of the innocent Guilford Four as well as the Maguire Seven, members of Gerry Conlon's family - including his father. When presented with evidence which is exculpatory for Gerry Conlon and his friend, including a confession by the real bomber, the police not only do not make this evidence known to the defense, they ignore it in its entirety and hide it away.

Like most lies, once told, they must be repeated. In this case the police did everything within their sphere of power to deny the truth for 14 years, and beyond.",1455148800,,912,4.877419354838709

The relationship between the father and son was real and raw.  Watching the know-it-all typical young adult grow and mature was powerful.

I have read many books on ""the troubles"" of Ireland, and the arguably horrendous actions by the IRA and the Youths that became entranced by its ideology.  But, the fact that the prisoners were treated as though human rights did not exist, is beautifully captured in this epic film.  I stage-managed a production about The Maze  prison.  This required volumes of research on my part.  The film has it all, and it is a social responsibility for anyone who visits Ireland and her wonderfully friendly people to see the film and wonder how could this be.",1453680000,,707,4.940677966101695

3499155,5,B001BTERXK,"Based on true events, the portrayal of 2 innocents, who, together with other family members, are swept up by England's government and police system at the start of the IRA bombings in London in the early 70's, for no other reason than they happened to be Irish, and happened to be in London near an IRA bombing. The police and other high governmental authorities lie outrageously, fabricate evidence and obstruct justice.. The father (Peter Postlethwaite) and son (Daniel Day Lewis) are  falsely accused, tried and convicted and jailed, for years,along with other family members, for crimes they did not commit. Postlethwaite and Lewis are intense as father and son trying to rescue each other and prove their innocence. Emma Thompson portrays the defense attorney, brilliantly. A good reminder for anyone who believes that their innocence will keep them out of prison, especially when a police state runs amok in a frenzy of terrorist attacks. Has to be seen to be believed. .",1453507200,,977,5.030864197530864

He always deal with IRA because he is from that place. And more interesting is the film budget partly comes from America.
This movie is kind of heavy and Daniel Day-Lewis is acting kind of a different person. Uneducated, nobrainer perhaps. His wearing and behavior shows it clearly. But one thing for sure is he has confidence that he did nothing wrong. He didn't put the bomb and he went to jail for nothing.
Most of the casting is familiar. They appeared in most of Jim's other movies which is interesting.

Day-Lewis, and director Jim Sheridan, give us a nuanced portrait of a petty juvenile delinquent who can't seem to take anything seriously, as he slowly morphs into a righteous and caring man. Emma Thompson is a little too timid in her role as public defender, I think, but generally she and the other supporting cast are excellent. I would have liked to see the final courtroom drama fleshed out in a bit more detail, but by then the audience knows what's going to happen, so maybe it was sensible to move through it pretty quickly.

3499204,5,B001BTERXK,"Besides an Oscar-worthy performance by Daniel Day-Lewis (does he know how to give any other kind?), and standout performances by Pete Postlewaite and Emma Thompson, this is the only film I've ever encountered that chronicles the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven.  These eleven Irish Nationals were used as scapegoats to appease the fear and paranoia leviathan in the midst of the IRA bombing campaign on British soil in the 1970s.  10 of the individuals were all connected to Gerry Conlon (alternately listed as Gerard and Gerald), the author of the memoir Proved Innocent, on which Jim Sheridan based his film.

I have used this film for several years in my interdisciplinary English classes.  My only criticism would be that on occasion the actors speak softly and their words can be lost at lower volumes.  I have found this to be true regardless of whether I screen the film on disc or stream it.  Nevertheless, the drama is compelling and moving.  This is a must see for anyone fascinated by dramas concerned with police and judicial corruption, abuse of power, and the trampling of Civil liberties and Due Process, not to mention the moral inversion, rush to judgment, and shoot first, ask questions later mindset that occurs whenever there is the threat of terrorism (likewise child abuse, witchcraft, or Communism).",1429142400,,1340,4.982062780269058

In this, the film succeeds.  It also succeeds in being a very good film.  The best thing about this film, by far, are the performances.  Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson, and Pete Postlethwaite in particular.  They convey the emotions of the characters so well, especially in the more intense scenes of the film.  The characters are very well-developed, even Thompson's character, which is impressive considering how little screen time she has.  That's not to undermine the other aspects of the film.  It's shot very well, the story is compelling, and everything included serves a purpose.  The only thing I didn't like was how poorly the length of time spent in the prison was.  At the end of the movie when they say that Gerry has been in prison for 15 years, it feels more like he'd been in prison for more like a year.  It doesn't help that Daniel Day-Lewis was never made to look older than he did at the beginning.

3499246,5,B001BTERXK,"The horrible tradegy these families and friends endured. Gerry's father dying in prison was so uncalled for. These families were physically beaten and other abuses by the British legal system. Dirty British police and none of the police were punished for their wrong doings. In fact some of them received promotions years later. The promotions were not related to the Conlon/McGuire cases. Still today, the British legal system remains corrupt. Falsely accusing innocent people. If I ever were to go to Great Britain, I would watch my back around the British police. This movie is heart wrenching. All the people were wrongfully convicted. Not just adults, but children were also convicted. Daniel Day-Lewis (Gerry Conlon), Emma Thompson (Gareth Pierce) and all actors in this movie did an excellent job. Excellent is putting it mildly. Daniel Day-Lewis put his heart and soul into this movie to show that all these people were innocent. It is a tearjerker at times. Gerry Conlon today suffers from PTSD and it is understandable after what this poor guy and his family endured. The McGuires went through hell. Annie McGuire is Gerry Conlon's aunt. Annie was in prison for 14 years, which should have never been. Her teenage boys put in prison. Patrick McGuire was only 12 or 14 years old. A young lad stuck behind bars for something he did not do. Giuseppe Conlon died in prison for something he did not do.
Yes, you must watch this movie because if you are around British dirty cops it could be you falsely accused of something. I do not know why the British legal system is allowed to continue their corrupt acts. If the police are dirty then it shows the entire system in disrepute. The British police need to be investigated, but then how can they be investigated when the entire system is dirty. Makes one think twice about visiting the UK.

3499251,4,B001BTERXK,"""In the Name of the Father"", newly released on Universal Blu-ray, has three strong arguments in its favor. First, there is the overall excellence of its production: the film, its director, Jim Sheridan, its co-writers, its editor and three of its actors were all nominated for  Oscars. Then there is the continuing relevance of its volatile subject matter and, finally, the mesmerizing quality of its leading performance, delivered by perhaps the finest film actor of the past thirty years, Daniel Day Lewis.
""Father"" is squarely in the middle of today's obsession with national security issues (cited in the dialogue),the fear engendered by domestic terrorism and the treatment of suspects before the law. This is a heavy trio of themes, to be sure, but ""Father"" presents them in a relatable if complicated father/son  struggle which evolves during more than a decade spent behind bars by the two. The father, Giuseppe Conlon (Oscar nominee Pete Postlethwaite) is a mild mannered and deeply religious man who works as a turf accountant (""bookie"" in American parlance) while his first born is a petty thief and ruffian who runs afoul of the local IRA and taunts the British soldiers occupying Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1974. Initially, Gerry Conlon (Day Lewis) presents himself as a Gaelic variation on Robert De Niro's Johnny Boy in Martin Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" (1973) with his clownish defiance of authority.
During the course of the film, however, he morphs from an irresponsible young man seeking ""free love and dope"" in a London hippie commune to a victim of British police brutality to an unjustly convicted victim derided as an ""Irish bastard"" and "" Irish scum"" in a politically charged courtroom and prison enflamed by the bombing of a pub frequented by the British military at home.
Finally, following a moral education at the hands of two fathers, one biological and the other a political terrorist, Joe Mc Andrew (Don Baker, in a surprisingly cool and elegant performance, given his character), he emerges as a strong willed crusader out to prove his father's innocence of the charge of criminal conspirator in the pub bombing and his own innocence as well.
 If the too comfortable and obvious symbolism of having father and son occupy the same cell underlines the more melodramatic aspects of the plot adapted from Gerry Conlon's autobiography, ""Proved Innocent"", then there is the schematic opposition of the two main British characters. The good defense attorney/solicitor Gareth Peirce, played by Oscar nominee Emma Thompson, accidentally uncovers the suppressed evidence that will free the unjustly imprisoned while the evil Chief Inspector Robert Dixon, played by Corin Redgrave, brother of Vanessa and Lynn, writes the incriminating and exculpatory note that will lead the presiding judge in the new hearing to throw out the case which resulted in some people spending 15 years of their lives in jail wrongly. What motivated Dixon? ""Our job is to stop the bombing"", he asserts. Even if he has to subvert the English judicial system to do so , observes the defense attorney.
""Father"" bristles with emotional energy, especially in the force of Day Lewis's and Postlethwaite's performances. It touches the raw nerves of every parent trying to communicate personal and cultural values to a child who is reluctant to absorb them. In one sense, ""In the Name of the Father"", the first words said when making the Sign of the Cross, depicts a lifelong battle between religion, represented by rosary beads and holy pictures, and the secular world, represented by an acid soaked map of the British Empire and posters of Jimi  Hendrix and Che Guevara, all of which figure in the visual design of the prison cells.
Giuseppe Conlon dies in prison, fearful but faithful to God and wife. It takes the horrific burning of the chief prison warden at the hands of the IRA agitator to turn Gerry against him and toward the securing of justice. Once his case, and those of the others, is dismissed, Gerry charges out of the front door of the courtroom building, proclaiming an ongoing campaign for the clearing of his father's name and in pursuit of the truth.
The British Prevention of Terrorism Act, cited in the film, is part of a continuum embracing American post 9/11 anti-terrorism legislation, including the establishment of the Homeland Security Department, and the bombing of the London transit system.
The Blu-ray of ""In The Name of the Father"", with its crisp, propulsive soundtrack and flawless blending of dialogue, sound effects and score (Bono and Sinead O""Connor are contributors) is an aural gut punch.

Terrific acting from everyone, touching, heart wrenching, violent, a bitter sweet relationship between father and son, hope, and much more. Daniel Day Lewis proves yet again that he is one of the greatest actors alive today. Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon- a two bit thief living in war torn northern Ireland. He has dreams of leaving forever for a life somewhere else full of free love and plenty of drugs. He and one of his friends take off for England. While there they hook up with a group of hippies who live in an abandoned house. Gerry decides to rob a hooker to help finance their trip. After returning to Ireland, a spiteful fellow hippy fingers Gerry and his buddy for being connected with the IRA and planting a bomb that kills 4 people in a British pub. Gerry, his friend, family, and several of the hippies from the house are accused of the crime and they are all sent to prison to serve long sentences. Gerry shares a cell with his own father while a determined lawyer played by the ever wonderful Emma Thompson fights outside the establishment to find the proof that Gerry and the others are innocent. The story based on actual events is a powerhouse and unforgettable movie experience that is sure to move the inner soul.",1371513600,,1316,4.556962025316456

3499274,5,B001BTERXK,"""In the Name of the Father"" is one of my favorite films of all time. Based on the true story of Gerry Conlon, a swaggering Northern Irish Catholic petty thief who, alongside with his commune squatting friends, as well as his more conventional family members, was wrongfully accused of an IRA bombing in the mid 70s. What makes this film so harrowing is the gut-wrenching and emotionally charged performances of the principle cast members, primarily Daniel Day-Lewis as the appropriately vitriolic Conlon. What could have been a sentimental story in the hands of a weaker director and screenwriter, is instead a stunning portrait of one of the worst miscarriages of justice by the British government. The politics of ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland may be integral to the plot, but the film never feels heavy handed or preachy on account of the superb writing. The plot-points allow viewers to draw their own conclusions based on the material shown and said on screen as opposed to merely explaining everything to the audience. Several scenes, such as Gerry's argument with his father over his delinquent nature, Gerry's reconciliation with his father in a touching but far from manipulative scene of the two men in prison, and the climatic court room scene in which Thompson's characters helps overturn Conlon and his friends' and relatives' sentences, are so brilliantly written and acted, I have watched them repeatedly on my DVD player, something even a cinephile of my caliber rarely does. Altogether, I highly recommend this film to those who appreciate transcendent and fervid storytelling",1343088000,,1598,5.15
3499275,3,B001BTERXK,"There are films that detail such horrific realities in injustice that one is left aggravated and completely frustrated throughout the film's entirety.  `In the Name of the Father' is one of those films.  Telling the true story of four young people and their families who become Britain's scapegoats during a time of panic, `In the Name of the Father' confronts the audience with a tale of corrupt police officers using brutality and disturbed tactics to coax confessions out of innocent people in order to stake a claim to stopping the terrorist threat causing a stir in London.

Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a screw-up of sorts who hasn't amounted to much but a partier a petty thief.  While in London, Gerry and a buddy wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they witness a bombing that takes the lives of five people.  Linked to crime by word from a jealous squatter, Gerry and his friends and eventually his father and aunt and cousins are accused of being IRA members in a move that is baffling (the interrogations and malicious testimony of the police officers is disgraceful to say the least).

Sentenced to life (with a minimum sentence of 30 years), Gerry's life has officially hit bottom.  Thankfully, for Gerry, his father is also sentenced for a crime he didn't commit and becomes his cellmate.

Gerry's father saves his life.

While the years slip by with little movement, eventually circumstances help Gerry to see the light in his father's plan to campaign to clear their names, especially once the real bomber steps forward and admits to his crime.  The police, afraid to lose face, refuse to admit this confession and so it is up to Gerry and his father, and a lawyer to prove their innocence.

The Academy obvious liked this film.  Back in '93 it was nominated for seven Oscars, including some big ones like Picture, Director and Actor.  As a whole, `In the Name of the Father' is very good, but I will admit that it takes its time getting there.  The first half of the film is a bit chaotic and not very compelling.  In fact, everything up until the initial interrogations it a bit jumbled and sloppy and Sheridan's direction feels almost like a television movie.  I also kind of hated Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in that first half.  Even as the film progressed, Day-Lewis tried too hard to enunciate his emotions that he came across extremely forced.  Emma Thompson and especially Pete Postlethwaite are very good here though.  The second half of the film, except for a small slag in the middle of the film, is pretty well orchestrated and pretty rousing, especially the last ten minutes.

I understand the love for this film.  I found it lacking in some areas but when it was on it was really ON and so I commend it for those parts.  I would watch this again, and it feels like the type of film that grows on you the more you watch it.  For now, I'd give it a high C, with Postlethwaite getting an easy A+ for his beautifully tempered performance of a man wishing his son would just grow up.",1329782400,,3035,4.621268656716418
3499276,5,B001BTERXK,"For years when I heard of this movie, I thought it was about Catholics!  Well, in an indirect way, the title does seemingly live up to that.  When the film begins we see Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his friend Paul (John Lynch) causing a riot on the streets of Belfast after being caught stealing metal off house roofs, and they have to flee to England to escape the IRA's wrath.  Neither of them are interested in working, happy to steal and crash with a bunch of hippies until one of them gets jealous over the time Conlon is spending with one of the girls and the two of them are unfortunately out on the street the night of the pub bombing in Guildford.  The ironic thing is, that shortly before this bombing, they meet a mysterious man in the park that later the police say never existed, and then Jerry unwisely steals money from a hooker's loft.  The same hippie who started a fight with them goes to the police, and then Paul, Gerry, and their families' lives are turned upside down.

They are tortured to the point of breaking down and confessing to a crime they didn't commit, and then are sentenced to jail along with the other Irish hippie in the squat and the girl Gerry was interested in.  There is also another group of people being unjustly accused of terrorism at the same time.  It was the first time in my life I wasn't so proud of my English heritage, but these things happen all over the world as my review title indicates, and Day-Lewis himself is English!  Though it supposedly didn't really happen, Jerry is rooming in a cell with his father Giuseppi, and their relationship goes from strained to something wonderfully touching throughout the course of the film.  Patient, kind, and very religious, he helps Gerry to stop being a screwoff--it's rather hilarious when he hangs out with the Jamaican prisoner whose girlfriend immersed a puzzle in liquid acid--and helps turn him into the man he later became.  What I'm really furious about is how when his father was dying, the cops let him instead of taking him to the hospital like they promised.  It was also outrageous that so much evidence was hidden at the initial trial and, to make matters worse, they did nothing when one of the prisoners came forward and admitted he was responsible for the bombing.  Thank God for Emma Thompson's lawyer character stirring up a well brewed pot of controversy over the case, but too bad Giuseppi never lasted long enough to see beyond the prison walls.  This wasn't just a miscarriage of justice; it was a bloody abortion!

If you have 2 hours and 20 minutes to spare for a movie with deep emotional impact and care about the injustices in this world, take a look at In the Name of the Father.  There is no way you can't be moved by the topic or the way in which it is deftly handled.  Also, God bless you, Gerry Conlon.

The film opens on a corner store at night. There is an explosion! It began in Belfast Ireland. Young men are stealing metal from a roof when they are fired upon by British soldiers. The community tries to help but the armored cars push through. The crowd throws stones at the soldiers. The IRA threatens the young thieves with being shot in their leg as punishment for starting trouble near their safe house. Gerry is exiled to England for safety. ""Honest money goes further."" Gerry stays at a house of squatters; they are vegetarians. [Does Gerry seem headed for trouble?] These squatters act like children, as if they never grew up. There is noise from an explosion. They stay at a park at night. Gerry trespasses and steals a small fortune, then returns home.

Somebody told the police that Gerry had a lot of money. The police break in and arrest Gerry as a suspect. [No subtitles.] Intensive interrogation breaks Gerry down. His family is arrested! Psychological tricks are used to get a written confession. Was it torture? Gerry's Dad was arrested after he went to see a lawyer! Gerry's speech shows his personal problems. [Was his cell bugged?] One guard notes the words in the visitor's room. ""Danny's dead."" [An incurable thief is a potential informer.] Nitrite tests on hands? [Recently painted surfaces?] The accused are in court. Were they all guilty? Physical and mental cruelty? There was no corroboration. Is Gerry convincing as a witness? Paul said they put a gun in his mouth to get a confession. This is a very emotional case and people are angry.

The jury finds the defendants guilty as charged, along with Conlon's relatives. The judge regrets he can't order the death penalty, and gives long prison terms to all the defendants. Can they get an appeal? ""Don't despair."" They wear special uniforms. Another prisoner confeses to the bombings. Will it mean anything? Gerry shows his personality faults. There is a fight when a new prisoner arrives. Can the English police admit to an error? We see how power is used: ""54 Halsey Road"". The riot squad takes over. Then a lawyer arrives. There is a violent attack on one prison guard during a movie.

The film slows down, father and son talk about the past. Lawyer Pierce seeks compassionate leave for Giuseppe Conlon. [Are prisoners allowed matches?] People demonstrate to ""Free the Guildford Four"". It has an effect. The stress affects Gerry. Lawyer Pierce finds suppressed evidence! A new court hearing after 15 years brings out the truth. There was an  alibi for Gerry Conlon but it was suppressed. The cases against Gerry Conlon and the others are all dismissed. The convictions of the Maguire family were overturned because of a lack of reliability and credibility in the prosecution's forensic evidence. Whenever the politicians put great pressure on the police to solve an outrageous crime they have to come up with a suspect. They only follow orders.

One value of this film is the scenes of life in Belfast and England that a tourist will not see, an unintended consequence. English law does not have a Bill of Rights to reduce oppression. [You will never see a movie about the framing of Tom Mooney back in 1916.]",1259798400,,3216,4.817028985507246

Any call for silence in the courtroom is most likely to be sincere when the comments of an attorney who discovered a file that was not to be shown to the defense underscore how rotton the core of courtly assertions has often been.

Like appreciating that Martin Luther was considered a criminal for being a heretic after openly opposing attermpts to shut him up, the idea that Saint Paul police twisted the arm of some radio news host in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in September, 2008, is as easy to understand as Jack Ruby catching Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of the Dallas Police Station in November, 1963, just a few weeks after what happened to Diem and Nhu in Vietnam and days after what happened to President Kennedy, if you understand how the police are likely to treat anyone they can hold for seven days in a situation that allows the police to control the mounting disgust.

The scene in the prison when Gerry Conlon's father is put into the same cell with his son is riviting. Day-Lewis's emotions build from confused to irate to explosive. Pete Postlethwait's sad, shocked reactions work perfectly with Day-Lewis. Throughout the film, these two work off each other--from lackadasical youth shunning his father's advice to mature, driven young man determined to be free. My Dad is 1/3 Irish & my mother 1/2 Brit.  So I've got a war going on inside me which sometimes blasts out like Gerry: ""Delayed shock! I've been this way since I was 7!!!"" The musical score is brilliant. Also, I'd advise you read the book by Gerry Conlon.  He is honest & straightforward. It's not just Britain that imprisons people wrongly, America has Quantanamo Bay. This is a cautionary tale for the justice system which should be shown to students of history in every high school, as well as to every civil servant--from Parliment to Senate to Congress.

3499286,5,B001BTERXK,"A remarkable film based on the true story of Gerry Conlan, In The Name Of The Father has one of the most gripping opening 20 minutes of any movie I have ever seen. The entire film is incredibly well written and superbly acted.
Essentially a tale of the miscarriage of justice and the abuse of police powers during the troubles, the film begins in Belfast with the British troops mistaking Conlon (Danile Day Lewis) for an IRA sniper and chaos ensues. This is just a foretelling of a much more serious mistake in identity that results in his being accused of being one of the Guilford Four bombers after being picked up by the police in London where he and his friend have gone to escape the dangers of Belfast.

Lewis is amazing in the lead role and the rest of the cast is fabulous as well. In the Name Of The Father is a story that serves as a cautionary tale regarding the abuse of power and how being the in wrong place at the wrong time can have devastating consequences.",1207440000,,976,4.362637362637362

3499288,4,B001BTERXK,"""In the Name of the Father"" is a movie based on a true story that shows not only how life can be unfair, but how, through strange circumstance, even in great suffering, a father and son come to know and love each other, when otherwise they might have drifted apart.

The story is set during the IRA revolution.  A first scene shows happy young people entering a English pub in the evening during the year 1974. Fire and smoke explode in front when a IRA bomb foes off, killing five people. An outraged public demands justice and the pressure on police is tremendous.

Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave), head of the police force, is desperate to find suspects - and needs them fast.  He picks on Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) with little evidence to back his charge.  (Daniel Day-Lewis plays this role superbly!)  Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill (John Lynch), are old childhood pals that meeting on a boat headed to London.  They play instead of work - want-a-be hippies out for a good time and finding home where they can, including  a park bench.  Somehow they become prime targets and are charged with the crime.

Gerry's father Giuseppe (a name given to him by his mother because she liked Italian Ice) rushes to help his son in London.  Pete Postlewait plays the father, Guisseppe.  It is a complicated relationship, but mostly antagonistic in the first part of the movie.  Guiseppe comes to London from their home in Belfast, Ireland, and is also charged as an IRA revolutionary.

At the trial, the ""Guildford Four"", including Gerry and Paul, are sentenced to life in prison and Giuseppe is given fourteen years.  The mother is there with the daughters of Guiseppe and sisters of Gerry.  She is heart-broken and another victim of the sad set of circumstances.  Later, evidence is uncovered that show Gerry and Paul are innocent.  For some reason of ""saving face"" the police keep it under wraps. It is not clear how or why Ms. Peirce, the lawyer (Emma Thompson), takes on the case, but she becomes the ""houndog of heaven"" - never letting go and digging out the facts and truth to get the unfair convictions overthrown.

The last courtroom scene is riveting and tense, yet wonderful in finally hearing that Gerry is free, although his father died in prison.  The freeing of Gerry and his three innocent friends is important, but every much as important is the bonding of father and son.  During the fourteen years together, they learn how to accept each other and develop a true father and son bond, love and respect.

3499293,5,B001BTERXK,"In the Name of the Father is superb.  It is both entertaining and moving.  Well-scripted, it shies away from the romanticism or melodrama that tends to muck-up films about legal injustices (e.g. The Hurricane - ""Hate put me in prison.  Love's gonna bust me out."") There's not a bad performance in the movie.  Day-Lewis, as Gerry Conlon, is nothing short of brilliant.  The same is true for the rest of the cast.

On a superficial level, it's a near-perfect guy movie.  It has everything the lads could want: riots, prison life, father-son bonding, IRA encounters, interrogations, courtroom drama, some comedy and a great soundtrack.

As a DVD package, it offers virtually nothing in the way of extras.  Don't expect anything of interest beyond the film itself.",1147737600,,760,4.968253968253968
3499294,4,B001BTERXK,"I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films.  As I watched In the Name of the Father unfold, I continually was impressed by the passionate camera angles, the conviction of the characters, and Sheridan's ability not to sway from his own personal heritage.  He is a master storyteller.  After watching this film, I am not afraid to confirm it.  From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political ""courtroom"" drama.  It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power.  I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate.  Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country.  The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do.  I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison.  Because of Sheridan, the masterpiece known as In the Name of the Father was crafted with genuine passion and superb direction.

What initially struck me as pivotal in this film were the actors.  For a film of this high of emotion and intensity to work, there needed to be key players involved that knew how to handle the truthfulness of it all.  Sheridan hit a bulls-eye with Daniel Day-Lewis in the key role of Gerry Conlon (which I think most directors do when they choose to hire one of our greatest cinematic heroes), but it was the surprise performance by the typical secondary character actor Pete Postlethwaite that shook me to the core.  I have seen quite a bit of films that used the talent of Pete Postlethwaite, but I must admit, this is the first time that I have seen him take control of his character and give it his full devotion.  Perhaps it was the dedication that Daniel Day-Lewis had to his character that rubbed onto the other actors, or again, maybe it was just the skillful direction of Jim Sheridan, but I will be the first to say that Postlethwaite stole this film.  He didn't just capture the individual scenes in which he was present, but he embodied this entire film.  He successfully portrayed the ultimate father figure.  The man that many of us would look up to with admiring respect.  Postlethwaite's father figure was there for his son, he put himself in danger for his son, and most importantly he taught his son the truth of the world.  He was phenomenal in the small role that eventually captured the entire film.  It is the belief of this reviewer that Pete should have been awarded for an Oscar for this role, instead of Tommy Lee Jones.  I was also impressed with John Lynch whom I had only seen in some smaller roles since this.  He fully embodied the frightened youth that didn't know better than to finger his friends to save his life.  Then there was Emma Thompson.  I do not believe I have seen her in a ""bad"" role yet.  She was subtle in this film.  She didn't try to dominate her scenes, but instead be a helpful part to the eventual emotional ending.  Her role was short, sweet, and to the point, which I think is another prime example of why Sheridan's direction is so acute.

Strong direction.  Strong acting.  One could say that the rest could have been rubbish and I still would have enjoyed it.  Not true.  With both of these elements in place, I needed to make sure that Sheridan wasn't cutting corners.  I have not read Proved Innocent, but I do not think that Sheridan went too far off course with his adaptation.  The story is what kept me glued to the screen.  I knew from the awards that In the Name of the Father was honored with that it was great in the direction and acting respects, but it wasn't until I watched the entire film that I realized the power of the story.  We don't watch Gerry grow up.  We don't see his dysfunctional relationship with his father.  We don't see the impeding chaos in Britain.  We don't see a lot of back items that would have taken this film into the three-hour zone.  Instead, Sheridan crops the film into three distinct moments.  Those are Gerry prior to jail, Gerry and his father in jail, and finally, Gerry gaining the wisdom from his father.  I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan didn't focus so intently on the trial, but instead the growth of Gerry and the developing relationship between him and father.  It was like watching a child grow before our eyes.  The only disappointment that I had with the overall story was the quickness of the ending.  I do believe Sheridan could have traveled it out for another twenty minutes to give us the full effect of the climactic courtroom scene, or those moments when Gerry decides to learn about British law himself.  I just felt that the last half-hour seemed to fly by because there were so many loose ends to tighten.  If it weren't for this mad sprint at the end, I believe Sheridan would have had a flawless masterpiece.

Overall, I thought this film (despite the quickness of the ending) was engrossing to watch and exciting to see.  It frightened me to watch it in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions.  It makes you wonder about the detainees of Iraq and if we, as a nation, are not discovering that our government is jailing the innocent.  Living in today's society and watching this film, it spoke to me on two levels.  Sheridan successfully brings the emotions of aggravation and frustration to the peak of the screen with the events surrounding the Conlon family.  He makes you feel for these innocent bystanders living in a corrupt nation.  It spoke to me on that level as I am probably one of those simpletons watching innocent people jailed for no reason outside of probably ""oil"" prices.  The second level was that of family.  It made me happy to have the father that I currently have and appreciate the wisdom that he has handed down to me.  Family is one of the most important elements in your life, and I believe that what Sheridan was trying to demonstrate with this film is that until you accept that, you will never find stability and security.  What an amazing film!

3499295,5,B001BTERXK,"Another powerful film.  Movies just get better and better.  Certainly Daniel-Day Lewis does.  Interestingly, this movie's executive producer was Gabriel Bryne who starred in ""Into the West"" which was scripted by Sheridan, who also directed Day-Lewis in ""My Left Foot"". It was very riveting - never seemed long or lost my focus at any point.  Fifteen years in prison for something you didn't do.  The concept is mind-boggling.  The disgraceful detective who allowed this to happen, even promoted it, was well played as a sniveling brownie by one of the Redgraves, Colin.  Raymond Massey's son also was good as the original prosecutor.  It was hard not to get mad when you see injustice so blatently splattered in front of you.  And the IRA did not come out well in this at all.  They were just plain murderers any way you looked at it.  The cast was excellent all round, as was the music by Bono of U-2.  Who else?

The British are responsible for terrible miscarriages of justice and have blood on their hands.

However, next time you think in admiration of those plucky irish rebels, please also spare a thought for the two kids, Jonathan Ball, 3 and Tim Parry, 11 who were blown up and killed by an IRA bomb planted in a bin on Bridge Street in my hometown of Warrington, England, in 1993.",1118188800,,771,4.696296296296296
3499299,5,B001BTERXK,"During a spate of IRA-triggered bombings in the early 1970s in the UK, the beleaguered British government created a haphazard ""Prevention of Terrorism Act"" which allowed the arrest of any individual on the flimsiest of suspicions.

When explosions rocked two pubs in Guildford (London?) a group of four Irish junkies -- Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) and three others -- were wrongfully arrested in what we are led to believe was a miscarriage of justice.

The movie is based on Gerry's memoirs, so it cannot be passed off as impeccably ""factual"" but if some memories have been bent into formulaic shape for entertainment purposes, the truth still remains: these people were not murdering masterminds.

There are really two stories working in the film:

(1) The steamrolling of the ""Guildford Four"" by the British government; and

(2) The atavistic relationship between Gerry and his father Guiseppe while the two were in prison

Each of these stories would have made a taut and fascinating film by itself, but combined they're an incredible force. Gerry's interrogation is an immemorable moment in cinematic history, including disconcerting scenes of police officials watching the torture in silence.

The film doesn't let up for a moment. The courtroom drama is clearly peripheral to the theme, but it provides some of the film's most nailbiting moments. A few bits in the latter half of the movie may seem a bit redundant (similar things happening over and over again in prison) all that is obscured by the sheer screen presence of Daniel Day Lewis. In fact, the only time you are not riveted by the all-round powerhouse acting is when U2's poignant background score has taken center stage.

An absolute must for fans of political films, and a terrific drama for the rest of us. Highly recommended.",1110931200,,1802,5.023489932885906
3499300,5,B001BTERXK,"Three films that stand out in terms of explaining the movement of the Irish Republican Army are Michael Collins, Bloody Sunday and The Name of the Father, viewed in that order. Michael Collins explains the 1916 Irish Rising against British rule and the subsequent assassination of Collins for making a deal with the British to allow them to keep the North, a problem that still exists to this day, albeit calmed down somewhat because of the peace agreements. Bloody Sunday is about the armed assault by British Paratroopers that shot up a catholic peace protest in 1972. It is like watching Saving Private Ryan in the streets. That court case is still ongoing today. The Name of the Father is in Britain and is worth seeing again because of new events.

In 2005 The Prime Minister apologised for one of the worst miscarriages of British justice - the jailing those accused of the Guilford IRA bombings. This film is about what happened. Eleven people sent to prison over the attacks in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. They were subject to such a horrific political ordeal and a deep miscarriage of injustice. The wrongly convicted were members and friends of two Irish families living in the UK at the time - the Conlons and Maguires. Although the Conlon father and son never did meet in prison (like they do in the film) it is still pretty much an accurate portrayal or police brutality and the corruption of the justice system.

In many ways the film has been deemed ""inappropriate"" along side other films such a ""Bloody Sunday"" because apparently they do not add anything of value to restoring peace, but the truth is that this kind of material has been censored in Ireland and the UK until the 1990s when for the first time the party of Sinn Fein was allowed a voice to represent Catholics in Northern Ireland - Jerry Adams was actually allowed to appear on the news and talk.

The problem is that the government is not responsible for the courts which allowed people to be subjected to the kind of ordeal that these two families went through, scapegoats for a political body that wanted to keep censoring the full extent of the troubles in the North.

This is a well-made movie with some great acting. Riveting stuff through and through and one of the best prison/court dramas who can get your hands on. In light of the Prime Minister's apology, this is work looking into again.",1107907200,,2383,4.68019093078759

3499302,5,B001BTERXK,"Daniel Day-Lewis, in another brilliant, Oscar-nominated performance. In the Name of the Father is a gritty, gut wrenching drama by  the talented Irish film maker Jim Sheridan. Daniel Day-Lewis proves why he is so respected and revered as an actor. Though his role as Gerard Conlon received less press than his turn as Christy Brown in My Left Foot, or Bill the Butcher, in Gangs of New York, he bristles with intensity as the troubled Conlon. Day-Lewis proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation. A true method actor, Day-Lewis is said to have gone through interrogations from police to lend true authenticity to the role. He has a rare and unequaled fire in his eyes that made me an immediate fan. I could simply not take my eyes off of him. He is not just another pretty face...although, what a face...he is without a doubt a very gifted actor.
Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite are just riviting on screen together. Their portrayl of father and son sings and stings with realism and sincerity.
This film has somehow gone largely unnoticed, however, it is a must see for those of you who enjoy a dose of reality with your drama.
Based on the book of the same name, written by Gerard Conlon himself, the movie does not cast a favorable light on the British Judicial system and their need to place blame on someone, despite their innocence. Your heart will break as you watch Guisseppe and Gerard fight for their case to be heard.
The movie, while placing focus on Day-Lewis's character, is an excellent forum for the wonderful character actor that Postlethwaite is. Their moments together are powerful and passionate. To find a better suited pair for father and son, one would indeed be hard pressed.
This film does exactly what it intended to do. 1. It creates and maintains a realistic relationship between father and son. Gerard's reaction when his father is imprisioned with him is a classic.
2. It is engaging. From begining to end this film will keep even the most hard-core action enthusiast engaged in the story.
3. It is honest. It does not sugar coat the facts as recalled by Conlon and it does not pretend to give a balanced view of events. Instead, it boldly makes a statement about profiling and what can happen when parinoia strikes those who are supposed to be objective and seek truth.

It wisely avoids over-the-top melodrama and even provides some moving scenes of a father and son relationship. However, as the plot unfolds, the movie starts losing its interest and becomes a familiar, average story about innocent and falsely-accused prisoners. At times, it almost seems like an ordinary made-for-tv flick exposing a prison tale, and the unsurprising and expected ending doesn`t help much, either. It also drags for too long, repeating its ideas and failing to engage at some parts. Overall, it`s not a bad cinematic experience but it lacks the punch and wit that it should have, and ends up being not too memmorable as a result.

3499308,5,B001BTERXK,"I must admit, I encountered a major stumbling block in trying to watch this movie.  All I can say is if you have as much trouble understanding heavy Irish accents as I do, watching a subtitled edition of this film might be a good idea.
That's my problem, though, not the film's.  In the Name of the Father isn't quite as dead serious as its cover suggests.  While its soaring emotional peaks are just phenomenally powerful and its messages ring clear and true, the film also contains enough offbeat humour to make it a well-rounded experience.
Daniel Day-Lewis gives a searing performance as Gerry Conlon, an Irish drifter wrongly accused of terrorism and imprisoned, a victim of a police conspiracy.  Day-Lewis, an Oscar-winning actor who has done only five films in the '90s, gives his signature dedication, enormous charisma, and sense of humour to the role, and he is no less than amazing in any given scene.  Pete Postlethwaite rises to the challenge as Conlon's father Guiseppe, a complete opposite to the deliciously diabolical turn he gave in The Usual Suspects.  Here Postlethwaite is warm, complex, and painfully human, with all the strengths and vulnerabilities attached.  And director Jim Sheridan's narrative voice is highly eccentric but engaging; the film moves in lurches and spurts, often with major plot points occuring very suddenly.  Strangely enough, I was never lost.  And Emma Thompson's work, when it finally surfaces (her character is mostly relegated to the last third of the film), is terrific as well, helping to anchor the final developments in the story.
One of my favourite points about this film is that, while it vilifies the British characters, it also does not scorn to show their side of the story.  The opening scene of the bombing grounds our awareness in the fact that, despite their incredibly brutal and unjust tactics, the police are simply crumbling under the pressure and trying to hide their folly, not plotting for the destruction of our central characters. Such moral complexities help enrich the thematic elements of the film, always a desireable thing when it comes to politically charged material such as this.
You'll need to be patient with this film to enjoy it -- because of its two-hour-plus running length, the dense, accented dialogue, and idiosyncratic narrative approach -- but I am sure you will find it an emotionally resonant and relevant film, as I have.",1033862400,,2416,5.002493765586035
3499309,5,B001BTERXK,"This is a powerful story, and watching it absolutely wrings you out.  You should see this movie, because the story is so emotional.  You should also see it because of the quality of the acting.  Daniel Day-Lewis' and Pete Postlethwaite's performances are so raw and perfectly understated that they make the film seem like the reality the story is based on.
Readers can get the gist of the plot from other reviews here, but there are a few remarks that should be made.
In this post-September 11 world, it should be noted that the thing that enabled these injustices was a bill that allowed British officials to hold suspected terrorists for up to 7 days without charging them.  This gave these officers all the time they needed to beat and intimidate Conlon into confessing something he didn't do.  The kind of power such a bill provides requires more responsibility than this.
While the British government does come out looking very bad in this film, it must be fairly pointed out that you can see why these officers were initially convinced of the Four's guilt:  they had been lied to by someone who disliked Gerry Conlon.  Naturally, at first, the police thought the Four were just lying to evade prosecution.  However, much later in the film, we see that Conlon's innocence had been proven to at least some of the officers a month or so after his arrest.  However, this was concealed from the rest of the judicial system, and the Four were still incarcerated.
I have to mention that some of the most powerful moments in the film actually come from Pete Postlethwaite's performance as Giuseppe Conlon.  His attempts, while in the middle of these horrible circumstances, to draw closer to his son are so genuine and heartfelt that it makes you want to cry.  This gentle, nice man's life was surrendered to these injustices, and all the while he still tried to teach his son to be good, to be honest, and to have ethics - in other words, to be a man.
There has been some commentary as to whether the Guildford Four were really innocent.  It should be stated here that the judge who released them - chief justice Lord Lane - stated that he felt the police involved in the case ""must have lied.""  Also, aside from an official apology from Tony Blair, the British government has made financial restitution to the Four.  I think that's enough to decide that they were probably innocent.
While occasionally seeming over-dramatized - like all films based on factual events - this movie succeeds in riveting you to the screen.  This is a good rendering of events that prove how tragedies can occur when you have people with too much power and not enough conscience.",1014163200,,2658,4.686021505376344

Daniel Day Lewis was made for this role, he is Gerry Conlon, he was real the perfect actor to play this role.

Emma Thompson was excellent as the British attorney, i don't think anyone else would ave fitted the part.
The location, Kilmainham Jail in Dublin, which ive visited many times was perfect because it actually was a jail, and made the film even more alive.

3499311,4,B001BTERXK,"This movie, based on a true story, is vivid and shocking indictment of the English criminal justice system.  It depicts a British society so obsessed with IRA terrorism that they would stop at nothing, even physical torture and near police state conditions, to bring a ""guilty person"" to justice.  It shows a system in which when the truth is uncovered that Conlon and his family were in fact blameless the authorities refuse to acknowledge this fact and allow to Conlon's to remain in prison.  Also shocking are the scenes in which not only are the prisoner's visits monitored but a transcript is taken of the conversations. However, not everyone victim of the British system was guilty.  This is the story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) a young Irish man caught in the wrong place and the wrong time and is implicated and ultimately convicted in an IRA bombing attack on a British pub.  The movie takes the viewer through this process.  From his time in London to his arrest and torture, both physical and psychological, at the hand of the British police during his interrogation to his 15 year incarceration in a maximum security facility to his triumphant appeal and release.  The interrogation sequences are most disturbing in their depiction of the combination of physical and mental abuse used to wear down a suspect to the point where he or she will admit and confess to any thing in order to end the abuse. We also see how the police arrest Conlon's entire family including his father as co-conspirators.  Ultimately, they are all convicted and sentenced to varying term in prison.  Conlon and his father Giuseppe are cell-mates and the movie goes on to explore the transformation of their relationship from a rather distant and cold one to a caring and loving one as the years of their incarceration drag on.  Daniel Day Lewis turns in a memorable performance in his monument to excesses of Britain's war on domestic terrorism.  Emma Thompson is OK in her role has a stalwart supporter of the family and their cause but her role could have been bigger.  This movie is not intended to be in any way balanced whatsoever.  The viewer is supposed to be sympathetic toward the Conlon family and have nothing but contempt for the British authorities.  The aforementioned instances and more make this emotional connection very easy to make.  That is a little more than disturbing.  As with other fact based movies, ""JFK"" et. al., we are getting a one sided view of the issue.  In many cases the makers use artistic license to ""tweak"" the plot in one way or the other.  As a result, viewers who may not be as up to speed on these issues may accept these interpretations as gospel when in fact they are not.  I am suggesting that viewers should not just accept at face value the opinions or views of very often biased director and producers who are out to make a political point.",1006646400,,2884,4.709163346613546

3499314,3,B001BTERXK,"Social justice always comes into play whenever the issue of what to do with Northern Ireland comes into play. As a result, whenever there's a new book out about it, or a film, or a song, nearly 30 years of conflict bubbles up slowly and ends up washing over everything.
One can't help but realize the irony of Gerry Conlon's life. While a young punk in Belfast, he stole and robbed with impunity, save for the IRA warnings; he never faced any punishment beyond that. Once he moves to London, Gerry keeps to himself and his family and friends. He keeps his nose clean, aside from free love and dope, and winds up in jail for a crime he didn't committ. Wherever he goes, society puts him behind bars because of his accent, socioeconomic status and manner of dress. The irony isn't lost on Gerry or anyone else. He accepts he's in jail for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He realizes there's no hope for him in either Belfast or London and that the system doesn't mind one bit.
What happens in 'In The Name Of The Father' is shocking at first, but it is also true. While anti-British elements in Northern Ireland might point to this film and say 'See? We TOLD you so!', it is still an excellent lesson in how political opportunism leads to abuses of power in its pursuit to end public fear of terrorism. Anyone concerned about a particular group terrorizing ANYONE ANYWHERE ought to look into the cases of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six and then look inside themselves, because it is when we are most afraid that out prejudices reveal themselves, and when that happens, freedom, democracy and justice suffer greatly.",988416000,,1632,4.573378839590443
3499315,3,B001BTERXK,"Daniel Day-Lewis is just too far over the top. I think he let his head become a bit too big after the successes of films like The Last of the Mohicans (which to this day I still cannot sit through). Day-Lewis won an Oscar for his portrayal of Christy Brown in My Left Foot, and as far as I can tell his career has been all downhill from there. This is not to say that this is a bad film. It is a true story but is told in a self-righteous and overly long fashion. The always-dependable Pete Postlethwaite is excellent as the father in this film. The story surrounds Day-Lewis's character, Gerry Conlon, and a group of his friends who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are convicted of being IRA bombers who blow up a club in London. Gerry's family is then drawn into the fold, and Gerry's father is convicted of having a key role in the bombing as well. The film tells the story of Gerry and his father surviving prison time while Gerry struggles to find an attorney who will help them to make their appeal. Finally they succeed in finding Emma Thompson, who again gives a splendid though small performance, who is the attorney who ultimately finds the evidence that acquits Gerry and his friends, but somehow does not acquit the father, who has by this time, died in prison. Gerry vows to fight on ""in the name of the father"" naturally. The film is good, and it illustrates how sometimes the justice system of any country does not necessarily search for or represent justice as much as it looks to find someone (anyone) guilty. Infuriating in this sense. Another good example of this kind of look at the justice system and the media is a film called Arlington Road, starring Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.",982368000,,1725,4.427672955974843
3499316,5,B001BTERXK,"""In the Name of the Father"" is a brilliant and controversial movie which examines in some detail the case of the Guildford Four, and especially the case of Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon, who were wrongly convicted of bombing a pub in the town of Guildford, England, on October 5, 1974. This bombing, which took the lives of several innocent victims, was alleged to be part of an ongoing Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of terror that year. The convictions of the Guildford Four, it was later proved, were based on forced confessions, perjured testimony, and - at best - extremely scanty and questionable forensic evidence.

""In the Name of the Father"" is a brilliant film on all levels. Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a tough, gritty, and realistic performance as the irrepressible Gerry Conlon - perhaps one of Day-Lewis' least known, but best movie performances ever. Pete Postlethwaite is magnificent as the gentle Giuseppe Conlon, who is the film's ultimate victim. And Emma Thompson rises to her usual level of brilliant acting as the tough-minded but emotional lawyer, Gareth Peirce.

This movie does not pretend at any point to be an objective examination of the Guildford Four case. It is a strong advocate for the innocence of the people involved, and an unsparing critic of the British legal and penal systems. Some of the points made in the film border on the hyperbolic - for example, the interjection of the fictional IRA terrorist ""Joe McAndrew,"" to press home the point that the British government knew of the Guildford Four's innocence, but, fearing a loss of confidence by the British public, chose to ignore evidence which exonerated them. Still, the film does not suffer any loss of credibility by so blatantly taking sides in such a politically and emotionally charged issue.

This is one of those rare films which does three things very well. First: it entertains. This is a dramatic and exciting story, replete with wonderfully realistic characters that are easy to understand and relate to.  Second: ""In the Name of the Father"" educates. Very seldom have I learned more about a particular time or set of circumstances than I have from this film. (I must note at this point that I was living in England in 1989 when this case came to a head. I followed news accounts of it with great interest.)  Third: the movie persuades. It is both a scathing criticism of a legal and penal system gone awry, and an apt description of what can happen when a democratic system becomes afraid of its own people. At the same time, it's a wonderfully inspiring testimony to the ultimate strength of the human spirit in times when all seems nearly lost.",974851200,,2652,4.845474613686534
3499317,5,B001BTERXK,Daniel Day-Lewis was wonderful as the out of control Irish boy who gets caught up in stuff above his head.  But the gem in this film is Pete Postlethwaite who plays the father.  His characterization of a man trying  his best to raise a child among bombs is gripping.  Definitely one of the  best overlooked actors today.  Another of his films to catch is Brassed  Off.  These great performances are made even more gripping by the fact that  these great film is based on a true story.,962409600,,483,4.459770114942529
3499318,4,B001BTERXK,"Gerry Conlon (Danie Day Lewis) was not an upstanding youth. He was a petty thief and layabout with little future. He was innocent, however, of the bombing of a London pub which killed four people in 1974. That did not stop  an English court, however, from sending him, his father, and several other  innocent men to prison.
What makes this story so compelling is that it is  true. Conlon really did serve 15 years in a British prison for a crime he  did not commit. His conviction was finally overturned in 1989, upon the  revelation that evidence which proved his innocence was deliberately  withheld by the government.
This film shows several chilling scenes where  Conlon is psychologically and physically abused until he finally breaks  down and confesses to the crime. He, along with the others, is then  sentenced to a long prison term. As the presiding judge tells him, ""I  only wish I could sentence you to death.""
After Gonlon and his  father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) enter prison in when the film's best  moments come. The way that the relationship between father and son grows  and matures is a pleasure to watch. This is one of the most compelling and  moving displays of father/son love that I have ever seen in a film. The  acting by these two men is nothing short of brilliant.
Emma Thompson is  also quite effective as the English defense attorney who works for their  release. This is just another entry in a seemingly endless string of  excellent performances by this gifted actress. She is an amazing  talent.
Much was made when this film was first released of the liberties  that writer-director Jim Sheridan took with the actual facts of the case.  That may well be true, but for the purposes of the film it is not really  relevant. This is not a documentary or journalistic report, and the facts  are close enough. It is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging film.",959040000,,1889,4.7446153846153845
3499319,4,B001BTERXK,"This is not a film that I watch very often but ""In the Name of the Father"" is still one of my favorites. The reason I am not watching it regularly is that it is quite disturbing. It is loosely based on the true  story of the Guildford four. A group of young people jailed for the bombing  of the Guildford pub in London back in 1974.

""In the Name of  the Father"" tells the story from the point of view of Gerry Conlon,  played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Gerry starts out as a young man in Ireland. He  is an unemployed lout who makes a little money on the side by stealing lead  lining off  neighborhood roofs. He is forced to leave Belfast due to the  IRA's disapproval of his thieving activities.

Once in London,  Gerry and his friend Paul Hill move into a squat with a group of other  flower children. It is not long before Gerry and Paul have to move out of  their new home due to friction over one of the young ladies' relationship  with Gerry. This leaves both Paul and Gerry in a public park on the night  that the Guildford Pub is bombed.

To make matters worse, the  jilted boyfriend of the aforementioned young lady, goes to the police to  finger Gerry and Paul as suspicious Irishmen. This is an opportunity too  good to miss for Inspector Pavis. He is under great pressure to bring the  guilty parties to justice.

The next thing we know Gerry, three of  his friends and the larger portion of his  family have been arrested, tried  and jailed. Only just short of being a kangaroo court, the prosecutor  paints them as a vicious IRA cell. The atmosphere is such that even the  flimsiest of evidence is seen as damning proof of their guilt.

Up  until this point in the film the story is told in retrospect, from many  years after the event, by Gerry as he languishes in prison with his Father,  Giuseppe. He is telling the story for a new barrister, Gareth Peirce,  played by Emma Thompson. She is keen to have a retrial. The trouble is that  Gerry is so cynical about English justice by this time, that he needs a lot  of encouragement in order for him to participate.

The rest of the  film shows us, one layer at a time, all of the deceptions that led to the  original convictions. False witnesses, false evidence, hidden testimonies,  forced confessions and even the cover up of the confession of the  real  bomber. It all comes to a head in court, but not before the death of  Giuseppe Conlon in prison, despite a compassionate appeal for early  release. We also see Gerry's transformation from a callow youth into a  dedicated campaigner for justice.

What makes this film so  disturbing is that the same forces that contributed to this outrageous  perversion of justice are alive and well today. The passion with which the  public calls for the conviction of anyone that is accused of a brutal  crime, is equally as vivid now as it was then. It should not matter how  brutal a crime is, we should call for the truth, not just revenge. And so  we are left with the knowledge that history will repeat itself and probably  is doing so at this very moment.",957657600,,3066,4.416517055655296
