8715293,5,B00X7LWXDQ,"In HBO's documentary, ""Nixon By Nixon: In His Own Words"" with a run-time of one hour and eleven minutes, we absolutely do learn in his own words. Although, they mostly were secretly taped so that he could certainly not take any of them back. Nixon also never thought they would be heard. We were able to hear the real Richard Milhous Nixon going on for quite some time in almost a ranting fashion about antisemitism, swearing just about every other word, and calling people many, many jaw-dropping derogatory terms to describe them... I was purely aghast even though I already knew of his proclivity for using the harshest of 'descriptive' wording. This shook me as many of the documentaries concerning Nixon do. It is hard to believe that this man opened discussions with the Moscow and also with China while setting into motion several programs in our country too. He was equally adept at foreign affairs as he was at domestic policies.

He was such a dichotomous man along with discovering several other sides to him that just keep popping up the more you learn. This documentary shows just how devious he is and the pandering he intends to do to the people he feels worthy of that information... ""The Silent Majority"". What he did to get elected into the second term of office is spelled out in short-form but a truth. Also, H.R. Haldeman along with Henry Kissinger's conversations with the President come to life as does John Dean who comes clean during the hearings all producing a knot in my stomach for our country's trials at the time which still are thought of today. A slight comment by John Ehrlichman adds to not just take a ""snippet"" of conversation from the infamous tapes to form an opinion as Nixon is much too ""paradoxically complex"" and calls for a historian to sit and listen to everything taped to draw a conclusion. You can right here...

All in all, this is another of the great documentaries of this man and President that really shouldn't be missed.",1499558400,,1974,4.702312138728324

8715295,5,B00X7LWXDQ,"The night of Watergate, we had taken our boys on a trip to DC and stayed at the Howard Johnson's (remember those) hotel across the street from the Watergate.  Saw that iconic building out our window.  Who knew?  As one who signed on in DC under LBJ the week JFK was killed, I have been endlessly fascinated by the complexities of both LBJ and RMN.  I thought John Dean's book was the penultimate on Mr. Nixon until I watched this.  It is mesmerizing.  His voice, discussing with Haldeman the fact that a Secret Service agent has offered to shoot Ted Kennedy.  You think you've heard it all until you hear these recent recordings, for real, from the University of Virginia.  It's must viewing for my grandsons as an example of how power corrupts.  I also kept President Nixon's letter of resignation on my office wall from 1974 on as a reminder to all of us what can happen when one man's ego is set loose.",1483488000,2,905,4.4363636363636365
