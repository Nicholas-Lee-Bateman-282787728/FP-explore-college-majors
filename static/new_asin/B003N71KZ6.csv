8400712,1,B003N71KZ6,I was so excited for this but come to find out you can't play it on your DVD player if it has a Region code on it. I didn't even know to look for that. So before you buy this make sure your DVD player can play disks from Region 2.,1507334400,,230,3.5294117647058822
8400713,5,B003N71KZ6,"I  sort  of  grew  up  watching  this  show,  I've  seen  all  the  seasons.  Its  the  kind  of  show  I'd  pass  on  to  my  kids  if  I  had  any!  Unfortunately  I  don't  have  any,  just  nieces  &  nephews.  In  this  show  each  Smurf  is  named  after  their  personality  when  they're  born,  &  when  Poppa  Smurf  discovers  their  hobbies  &  interests.  That's  how  they  got  their  names.  Poppa  Smurf  is  a  good  leader  who  spends  a  lot  of  his  time  working  on  potions  &  magic  spells  without  the  help  of  a  sorcerer  or  a  wizard.  The  Smurfs  always  get  into  mischief  if  they  don't  take  Poppa  Smurfs  advice.  &  one  thing  he's good  at  is  getting  things  under  control  &  setting  them  straight.  Pretty  much  always  they  must  be  prepared  to  outwit  the  hateful  Gargamale.  Who'll  stop  at  nothing  to  capture  the  Smurfs  once  &  for  all,  him  &  his  sidekick  cat  Azrael.  They  often  wind  up  with  other  enemies  too,  not  to  mention  things  which  get  out  of  control  &  quickly  become  urgent.  You'll  hear  some  fast  music  which  starts  playing  at  the  time  their  situation  is  considered  urgent,  At  times  it  can  be  ridiculous  because  what  they  get  into  isn't  always  serious  when  you  hear  that  music.  Each  of  us  hold  our  breath  as  they  try  very  hard  to  get  their  problem  under  control  at  that  time.  I  mean  considering  their  own  problems  that  they  have  around  the  village,  &  trying  to  live  in  peace  isn't  always  easy.  Sometimes  they  stumble  across  many  unheard  of  things.  A  lot  of  which  I  think  we  find  pretty  silly  &  quite  amusing.  Brainy  spends  much  of  his  time  trying  to  impress  Poppa  Smurf,  we  see  him  trying  to  be  a  leader  to  the  Smurfs,  I  think  because  maybe  he's  a  little  jealous  of  Poppa  Smurf.
What's  funny  about  Brainy  is  he's  always  getting  thrown  out  of  the  village  &  landing  upside  down  on  his  head  after  they  get  tired  of  him.  My  favorite  Smurfs  I  know  are,  Poppa Smurf, Brainy, Clumsy, Smurffett, Handy, Hefty, Jokey, Greedy, Grouchy,  &  Lazy.  They're  the  ones  we're  mostly  familiar  with.  Unfortunately  they  only  included  3  or  4  Smurfs  in  the  movie  they  just  released  a  few  yrs.  ago.  There  were  at  least  4  others  that  should  have  been  there  that  weren't.  &  one  yellow  haired  Smurf  with  sideburns  that  I've  never  seen  before  &  did  not  exist  in  the  every  Saturday  cartoons  we  used  to  watch.
The  show  never  fails  to  capture  the  curiosity  of  a  child.  Some  people  even  in  their  early  20's  or  30's  still  enjoy  the  show  to  this  very  day,  I  grew  up  around  a  family  who'd  sometimes  turn  off  the  TV,  &  I  had  to  go  with  my  folks  while  they  ran  their  errands,  or  I'd  get  behind  on  my  chores.  So  sometimes  I  didn't  always  get  to  the  end  of  the  episode  or  the  end  of  the  show,  But  I've  always  been  thrilled  by  it.  The show  is  really  less  then  half  an  hour,  really  about  20  minutes  with  3  or  4  10  minute  episodes.  I  was  never  ready  for  it  to  be  over.  I  am  just  glad  to  find  it  here  on  Amazon.  The  Smurfs  is  like  no  other  show  you'll  find,  they  get  into  the  most  unusual  problems  you  can  think  of.  Perfect  fairytale  drama.
The  memories  of  this  show  live  on.  I  don't  recommend  the  show  for  every  grownup  out  there.  Its  mostly  a  children's  TV  show.  If  grownups  like  it  then  be  my  guest.  Right  now  what  I've  seen  on  Amazon  as  far  this  goes  you  really  don't  get  too  many  choices  if  your  looking  for  a  full  season  or  volume  with  6  to  8  hours  worth.  There  are  a  few  seasons  out  there  worth  purchasing.  I  just  wish  there  was  more.  Then  I  would  definitely  make  a  full  consideration  for  the  entire  series  package.  How  ever  many  seasons  there  is.  I'm  not  quite  sure  to  be  honest.
&  thank  God  now  it  still  comes  on  Cartoon  Network  which  means  it  has  not  been  cancelled,  &  lets  hope  they  don't  cancel  it.
So  far  Amazon  does  not  have  the  entire  series.  I  await  the  right  time  to  buy  at  least  seasons  1  2  &  3.",1445385600,3,4403,4.244350282485875

8400716,4,B003N71KZ6,"Anyone in the US will probably never get the complete smurfs as Time Warner has released some digital only and some on DVD but none complete.

So this is the start of getting the DVDs, they are PAL format and prints are just as good as the NTSC sets. My only complaint is they replaced the original title screens and ending credits with new digital screens, while it doesn't take away from the episodes it looks ""out of place"".

The rest of the seasons (2-5) are available from Amazon UK you can get them there.

You can play PAL dvds on any computer that has a region free drive or by using region free software. Personally I just make a DVD-R copy region free and use it on my player, but you can do it anyway you want to plenty of links and help about it.",1367107200,12,758,4.178082191780822
