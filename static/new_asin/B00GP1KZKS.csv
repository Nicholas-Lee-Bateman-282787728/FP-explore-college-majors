Happily, for me, there are exercises which break down the piqu arabesque, which has always been an especially challenging problem. Sachiko Kanai is the beautiful demonstrator, and we are able to learn a lot by watching how Finis corrects and coaches her to his exacting standards. At the end of the DVD, we are treated to some outtakes where we witness the process of perfecting the tricky waltz step. I am super excited knowing that this video holds the answers to questions Ive had for quite a while. I strongly encourage all adult beginners to get this video so they can find out what theyve been missing! Ileana L. Ray  Adult Student, The Ailey Extension",1462665600,,1055,4.641711229946524
8625971,5,B00GP1KZKS,These videos are great.  They break it down for you and show the slow moves from different angle.  The teaching and demonstration is amazing.  My wife uses them to practice her ballet moves at home.  She has been looking for a step-to-step video for adult beginners for a while and is very glad to find these.  She plans to study them one by one and she said it would help her better perform in class.,1456358400,,401,4.293333333333333
