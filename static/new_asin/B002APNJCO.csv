3890692,5,B002APNJCO,"Everybody Hates Chris is a show kinda like The Simpsons, the worst in it is usually language. I'm getting this first day! It's also kinda like My Name is Earl. Chris is the only black kid at his school and has trouble. He has a friend named Greg. Greg and Chris are like me and my friend, except, me and my friend have crude adventures. All in all, Chris is a great show! Du-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1142812800,,419,4.675675675675675
3890693,5,B002APNJCO,"I had to write a review about ""Everybody Hates Chris,"" simply because I strongly believe this is a show that EVERYBODY has got to watch.

For starters, the writing is fresh, funny and incredibly socially conscious, without being preachy.  The first season is set in 1982, where a young Chris Rock, now well-recognized as a very funny stand-up comedian, played by the phenomenal Tyler James Williams (who looks just like the real Chris, by the way) is just trying to survive, one day at a time, in his ""urban"" (to be diplomatic) neighborhood,  his predominantly White school (where just about every kid wants to beat him to a pulp),  and in his household, where everyone (certainly acts like they) hate Chris.  Chris must shoulder the responsiblity of caring for his younger brother and sister, and basically takes the blame for every prank they pull.

The show juxtaposes fantasy flashbacks, music truly authentic to the era, and over-the-top sidesplitting, literal reinactments of idle threats (made by his parents), with glimpses into Chris' day-to-day existence and how even the most--seemingly--straightforward situations (doing the laundry, babysitting for his siblings, for example) spiral into wild misadventures, for the young man, his good friend Greg (Vincent Martella), his brother, Drew (Tequan Richmond), sister, Tonya (Imani Hakim), and parents, Rochelle (Tichina Arnold) and Julius (Terry Crews).

I reccomend you watch this with your children.  It will teach you something about race relations in the United States, during the early 1980s, the plight of children living in poor neighborhoods of New York, and the universal struggle of growing up.  This show continues to make us laugh, all the while educating us, and making us think.  I hope ""Everybody Hates Chris"" is on the air for a very long time to come!!!",1137283200,4,1828,5.187074829931973

3890698,5,B002APNJCO,I bought this for a 12 year old who visits often.  We watch it together.  It's great for young and not so young people. So enjoyable.,1517875200,,133,4.076923076923077
3890699,4,B002APNJCO,"Chris Rock started out as a stand-up comedian in New York, getting enough notice to find a few small film roles and eventually catching the eye of Eddie Murphy who mentored the young man. That led to his audition and acceptance to SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE in 1990 and from there performing stand-up in larger venues as well as into major movies where he was the lead. Then in 2008 he took the story of his early years growing up and created the CW series EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS.

The show focuses on Chris (Tyler James Williams), one of three children in his family and the awkward one at that. The character seems destined for failure with few friends, having a geeky attitude and with siblings that either taunt or exceed any expectations that are had for all three. But he carries on even though things don't always go his way and learns many life lessons in the process.

Chris' parents are Julius (Terry Crews) and Rochelle (Tichina Arnold). Julius is a hard working father who most consider cheap and this plays into much of the character and his attempts to save a buck. Rochelle is the loving mother who takes no guff from her children and has a ready comeback for each should they choose to cross her. Both are loving parents that want the best for their children and while keeping them in line offer them great role models and someone to care about each one.

Chris' brother Drew (Tequan Richmond) is everything Chris is not. He's popular, athletic, an academic, handsome and idolized by not just his fellow classmates but by Chris as well. But there's a grass is always greener dynamic between the two since Drew admires his little brother for his own abilities.

His sister Tonya (Imani Hakim) is the closest to a stereotypical character as you'll find here. She loves her brothers but also enjoys getting them in trouble. And being the baby of the family her parents tend to believe her no matter what anyone else says.

With those characters in place one would think this was nothing more than a retread of a multitude of other sitcom family comedies that had come before and appeared since. But that wasn't the case. Sitcom families are more based in the reality they make up than most give them credit for. But it is how they interact, the situations they find themselves in and the location of where all this takes place alter those basic elements into something else. EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS takes place in the area the Chris Rock grew up in and that wasn't quite the same neighborhood as Beaver Cleaver.

This is a neighborhood where you might see a dealer, where people hang out at the barber shop, where a local grocery is where people shop as opposed to a Walmart. You'll see nosey neighbors, whole blocks that will watch out for the kids and even homeless people on the street. This is not the prim and proper well-coiffed streets of the Cleaver family but a real life neighborhood. The fact is this is the type of neighborhood most of us actually grew up in.

While the show did decent in the ratings it was never a juggernaut series. Then again at the time CW was also not the major network that it's since become. But the fact remains that it was series like this that helped it move from the minor player it was to the fairly popular one it is now. Not only that the series also focused on two items missing from much of TV programming at the time: what it's like to be in school and the black family on TV. They may seem more ingrained in our viewing these days but it was shows like this that helped make that happen.

Many different groups recognized the groundbreaking steps this show made at the time and it won numerous awards. A Golden Globe, Emmys, Writers Guild of America, Television Critics Association, Teen Choice, Image Awards, People's Choice Awards and more all passed praise on to this series and rightfully so. In the end it wasn't so much the vast numbers that were watching when it first aired but the influence and affect it had for those who did watch it and who now watch it in syndication.

Here's the thing. If you missed it when it was on and if you don't have access to the stations that run it now you can still discover it with this release. The entire run is collected in this new box release set that will provide you with all the episodes start to finish. You'll find yourself laughing, you'll find yourself touched at times and you'll reflect on a number of memories from your own time in school where you felt like one of the characters here. And most of all you'll be entertained. What more could you ask for in a show?",1517270400,,4573,4.5

3890705,3,B002APNJCO,"This show had so much potential. I'm currently watching the series and want to enjoy it but it tries too hard. It tries too hard to make you laugh. The things they did the most like Chris Rock's commentary and the re-enactments of Chris Rocks jokes were over the top. To the point where I was getting annoyed with the re-enactments. Most of my laughs came from young Chris and the neighborhood people like the funeral director, the store clerk, the hair dressers, etc. Could have been a great show if they focused more on young Chris, the neighborhood people and the 80s era and less on trying to re-enact a joke from Chris Rock's commentary.",1504483200,,642,4.543103448275862

3890713,3,B002APNJCO,"The complete series are all of the individual seasons wrapped together.  While it's nice that they aren't all on a spindle like other cheap sets, the teeth that hold the discs in break pretty easily.  So easily that many of them were broken when it arrived, causing one of the discs to have a ring scratched into it.  One of the episodes on that disc froze my blu-ray player.  This seems to only be the first season, the other seasons are packaged better.  I am debating ordering a replacement.",1496620800,,494,4.50561797752809

The entire cast did an excellent job with their acting! It was easy to fall in love with this family. Julius was the hard working father who loved his wife and kids. Rochelle was the glue that held the family together and kept everybody in line. You always felt bad for Chris because he could never catch a break. Drew and Tanya were the younger siblings who kept Chris in trouble. This comedy series was a great family show. It was devastating to see such a good show come to an end. I wish they could at least do a special episode and let us know if Chris passed his GED. I was so pleased to get a copy of the collection and the price was reasonable. All four seasons came as promised, and so far, I haven't ran into any problems with picture or sound quality.

3890830,5,B002APNJCO,"Chris Rock has such great talent and we are so glad that we are able to view his talent and be entertained with clean T.V. shows. We also own I think I love my wife DVD which Chris Rock made. Both are great!

We own the whole season for Everybody Hates Chris and we love it! We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set as it was more affordable to purchase the set. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and Everybody Hates Chris Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!

Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.

Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!

He has gone through the entire series, and now, while out of school for the summer, watches the episodes over and over. The entire family has laughed over and over at how funny these DVDs are. Some of the language and situations were inappropriate during the 80s, on which it was based, and even now, but if you don't take yourself too seriously, it's absolutely hilarious. Chris Rock was and is a favorite of ours and sometimes too shocking but too funny for words. Reminds us of how times have changed and how to laugh at ourselves.",1341532800,2,669,4.537190082644628

It not only is very, very funny, but sweet and many of its messages universal. Until recently known to me only for his adult humor, Chris Rock clearly has a huge soft spot for every character that inhabits his show. The family is so great. Terry Crews is Julius, the long-suffering, penny pinching husband and father who always comes through for his family; Tichina Arnold as Rochelle is one of the best physical comedians ever, male or female--what she can do with her face, body, and voice is amazing. The kids and supporting characters are just right. Clearly great writing and perfect casting have made EHC the gem it is. Watching this show just makes me happy!",1331251200,,823,4.554054054054054

Now, why I think this show is great and a must see for all families.....  everybody hates Chris is about a real middle class family that loves each other and deals with everyday issues. While some of the issues may seem culturally specific (Black experience), all cultures can relate to the underlining message. Besides, it is time that all shows are appreciated for the entertainment and message and not the cultural specificity of a small number of segments. The show is down right funny!!!!  This is a show that you can watch with your children , girlfriends, or boyfriend and never feel that it is irrelevant. I did not watch while it was on the air, but now believe that Chris Rock should have been given praise for creating a truly enjoyable family show.",1323388800,2,1013,4.616666666666666

I begine  to catch reruns on the syndicated station here, it started to grow
on me. I now consider it to be up there with alot of the classic African
American tv shows. I guese the show eventually went off the air as most
sitcoms that feature child stars as they out grow the show. What was appealing
about the show to someone in my age group is the mature nature of the show.
I  also like the Simpson's for the same reason, even though I'm not usually into cartoons unless they are the old Warner Brothers type. I also like the guese
appearances of some Icons from black sitcomes from the 70s on EHC.",1297123200,2,671,4.234375

How they keep a straight face while saying some of their lines is beyond me.  The stories are so funny, and Chris Rock's narration is the icing on the cake.  Since I hate all the commercials on TV, I ordered the complete DVD set.  It's great, including the extras.  My only complaint is that there is no closed captioning available on the DVDs.  As noisy as my kids can be, I like having the ""words on"" while I'm watching shows.  However, my TV itself has closed captioning, so I use that instead.

I recently started to watch again, so you can imagine how I feel knowing that the show recently underwent cancellation. To take something so PERFECT off of television fills me with sadness and frustration! So let me put my emotions aside for a bit to explain one of the greatest shows to ever hit the airwaves!

The show revolves around the everyday life of Chris, who is a 12-year-old seventh grade student in the series' first episode. Chris is surrounded by a collection of interesting characters that, in his point of view, act as though they dislike him. Chris lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, a low-income community and attends an all-white school, where students and teachers alike pick on him. If things go well for Chris throughout an episode, then, 9 times out of ten, the situation will backfire on him by the end. On the same token, If a situation isn't going Chris' way, it always manages to get even worse for him, whether or not he tries to change the course of events. Chris Rock (a true genius and one of my all-time favorite Comedians) narrates the show and takes us through the ups and downs of his years living in Bed-Stuy during the early-mid 1980's. Tyler James Williams, who plays young Chris Rock, never fails to make you laugh with his professional sense of humor and jokes. Chris has major wit and charm! You find yourself sympathetic towards his character, with high hopes for a happy ending.

Mr. Rocks' narration ALONE will have you ROTFL, and the actors hit you with just the same! Julius (Terry Crews) is the perfect example of a good Father! He holds down his household and always shows love and affection; this man adooores his family! Rochelle (Tichina Arnold), in my eyes, is a Legend! This smart, intelligent woman won me over the very first time I witnessed her talent back in the mid-'90s, on the sitcom, ""Martin""; she's back and BETTER THAN EVER! Tichina will, without a doubt, make your entire face ache and your cheeks tense up with laughter! Drew (Tequan Richmond) and Tanya (Imani Hakim) are so adorable. They always argue, but they also like working together, especially when it comes to getting what they want from their parents. Chris' best friend Greg (Vincent Martella) will make you laugh as well, for he shows that he can stand beside his fellow actors and rise to the occasion of pure comedy.

One thing that stands out, probably the most, in the show is the array of '80s music used in the beginning of almost every episode. Artists such as Run DMC, Janet Jackson, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Howard Jones, LL Cool J, Culture Club, Madonna, Duran Duran and Kool Moe Dee lend their '80s hits to the show, as well as many other '80s musiciansthe list goes on!

WARNING: I will say this much, there are MANY episodes in this box set that have alternate music per episode (particularly Season 1). The original music soundtrack has suffered the ""cut/uncut"" treatment by Paramount (The Kings & Queens of destroying authentic movies and television shows, converting most episodes to edit format). Certain episodes have alternate music to support its intro. My guess is that Paramount was too lazy and cheap to conjure up a deal with the artists/companies who own the rights to the music. Oh, but don't worry though. If you want to watch the episodes in their full-original-music-soundtrack-glory, you will have to catch them as they air on BET or Nick @ Nite. Personally, embarking on a full-fledge television search for the original episode/soundtrack, when owning the box set should be more than enough, is ridiculous! I guess, in this instance, it's better to have alternate music on certain episodes rather than nothing at all.

On a lighter note, EHC is blessed with a reunion of seasoned vet actors and comedians, all whom play permanent roles throughout the entire series. Talented professionals such as: Jack&eacute;e Harry, Wayne Brady, Whoopi Goldberg, Antonio Fargas, Tisha Cambell-Martin, Ricky Harris, Ernest Thomas, Robin Givens and Mike Estime all shine, as well as a few new faces from the modern era of film/television.

Each season has a plethora of extras: Commentary on certain episodes, Webisodes on almost every episode, and deleted scenes, which are so funny, you can't help but wonder why they weren't left in the original episode.

It's very hard for me to even sit and watch the last season on disc because you just know that it's the end; it's final! And let's face it, there are not a lot of outstanding African American television shows out there nowadays that tend to make it past 4 or 5 seasons due to fans tuning in for a short period of time (during the beginning), then suddenly tuning out, which sends ratings in decline. I feel that we, the viewers, should make it our duty to keep our favorite shows on the air and support them, especially the shows that are quintessential to their nature. Otherwise, cancellations will continue to plague all genuine African American comedies, dramas and sitcoms. So this is my plea to all, like myself, who love and enjoy outstanding African American comedies, such as: Everybody Hates Chris, Tyler Perry's House of Payne, The Game, we must take the necessary steps needed to keep our shows where they belongon television!

I enjoy watching every episode, and I equally enjoy my occasional EHC marathons. But when the last season rolls around, what was once fun, enjoyable entertainment, slowly becomes a recollect of sad memories; memories of great, talented work, all of which leads up to the very last episode of the series. There is an empty space etched in your heart for everyone involved with the show. You are then left wondering what could have been for the members of the Rock family. EHC is now off the air and will not return anytime soon! I had hopes that BET would pick it up, but I don't know of any new news stating that this will happen. In a post I came across a few days after hearing about the cancellation, it read that Chris Rock announced the end of season 4 matched up with his own pastdropping out of high school to become a comedian, and that, basically, it was time to end the show. Again, they are the actors/entertainers, and we are the fans/viewing public. They do their part, now it's important to accomplish ours. So I reiterate: we must save our genuine black comedies!

Narrated by Chris Rock and inspired by his own childhood, Chris, played by Tyler James Williams spotlights the catastrophes, misfortunes and triumphs of growing up.  Constantly at cross purposes with his loving but dysfunctional family, Chris finds that being a kid isn't easy.  Every character in the show is wonderfully authentic and original and each problem Chris encounters is one that kids today will relate to. Chris Rocks' hilarious narration delivers bursts of precisely executed humor into each exceptional episode. Enjoy!",1256083200,31,637,5.414141414141414

3890852,5,B002APNJCO,"When it comes to a stereotypical Black comedy, it's all about having bad-ass attitudes, 'ooohhh girrl', 'mmm-hmmm', and clicking your fingers.

That's all I ever seem to see nowadays with these black comedy's. It gets fairly annoying, repetitive and quite frankly...cheesy! I'd given up hope seeing a decent Black comedy since Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and My Wife and Kids.

BUT.......

'Everybody Hates Chris' is a wonderful breath of fresh-air! Chris Rock expressing his childhood through comedy is very inspirational and brave. By balancing issues with fresh comedy is sure to be a thumbs up!

Whenever this comedy ends, lets hope it ends as a comedy to remember and love (and with a decent ending!)

Can't wait when this gets out on DVD!",1145923200,,740,4.983739837398374
