2792412,5,B000O7861E,THIS IS A GREAT DVD FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN YOU WILL LOVE IT.MONEY WELL SPENT.,1235260800,,78,4.266666666666667
2792413,4,B000O7861E,"Awesome filmage. The life of insects is really fascinating and vital for the survival of rest of the living creatures on earth. Magnificent close-ups and time-lap photography. For bug lovers a really nice addition to the collection. The down side is, that the documentary is damn too short. Only 38 minutes. Product information says 40 minutes, yes, only if you count the end credits as part of the total lenght. Many scenes are staged and digital effects have been added.  However, it has been well done, it is very realistic and the ""making of"" section is informative and interesting. The overall impression is that this documentary is worth the price. Although, Microcosmos, Genesis and Life in the Undergrowth are MUCH better.",1212278400,,730,5.033057851239669
2792414,5,B000O7861E,"First, the info on Tivo for this movie was incorrect (the info was for Bugs! a violent sci fi movie) and after an initial shock, we were relieved that we had the correct movie.

This is a well-done documentary, originally made for IMAX and made for BIG screens, narrated by Judi Dench giving much information about insects in the rainforest and centering on the lives of a butterfly and a praying mantis.

My 6-year-old son did well watching it and enjoyed it, although he did start commenting on how long the movie was at about 33 minutes of the 40 minutes run time. Admittedly, the movie was a little slow at some parts for a 6-year-old (and a 43-year-old), focusing on panoramic vistas and insect reproduction, but overall enjoyable.

One caution: do not plan on eating anytime after the movie ....",1212192000,,801,4.666666666666667
2792415,5,B000O7861E,"Our whole family, my girls(2 and 3yrs), my wife and I love it, didn't expect to enjoy it this much.  Wish we could see it in the original 3-D.  It is obvious that they put a lot of effort into this, details. details details, all blown up to see up close.  Makes you want to got to your own back yard to see what is living in the weeds.  The extras are full of even more cool footage and stories. Buy it, otherwise, it's going to bug you!",1211241600,,437,3.9318181818181817
2792416,3,B000O7861E,"The bugs were huge, kind of scared my 2 year old. My bug loving kids were very excited to watch this but they got bored about 10 minutes into this show. I found it interesting, but it didn't impress my 2 and 6 year old",1208736000,3,218,3.8666666666666667
2792417,5,B000O7861E,"One of the best bug dvd s I have seen.  Several of my friends have also viewed my copy and every one, bug lover or not, thinks it is great. several even commented on the narration being so clear.  I loved it absolutely.  Such wonderful photography.",1202428800,,248,4.3478260869565215
2792418,4,B000O7861E,"This DVD is a wonderful window into the world of bugs.  However, it was not the Nature film I thought it would be.  The DVD tells a ""life story"" of a butterfly and a praying mantis and all of the photos are staged and posed.  That may or may not be a deterrent to most people who like to watch this type of DVD.  This is NOT an animated kid's film - a clue is the reference to IMAX.  The ""how did they film this?"" section of the DVD was fascinating.

All in all a wonderful DVD with some amazing close ups of the bug world.",1200528000,,523,3.8867924528301887
2792419,5,B000O7861E,"This incredibly beautiful film is like a trip to the outer edges of Eden.  The stunning cinematography is a sight to behold again and again.  Judi Dench's measured voice work is a perfect match.  This film reminds me a little of ""Micro Cosmos"" in tone and style.  I have an affection for the great beauty of the natural world caught on film.  I find it reassuring and also somewhat disturbing that this world is more mysterious than we can possibly imagine and also more awesome and wonderful.  Yes, feel the wonder and awe.  Because that's what this little gem is all about.",1197244800,12,575,4.578431372549019
2792420,5,B000O7861E,"Our entire family enjoyed this movie!  The music is upbeat and dramatic at times. The scenary is of a lush wet rain forest. The narration by Judi Dench is superb! The information is fascinating and the entire BUGS adventure left a lasting impression on us. (observe & respect their life cycle) In this film, you will experience and witness the incredible life and survival of many different types of bugs. For example, 2 male rhino beetles battling for the affection of an awaiting female, witness hundreds of praying mantis hatching from one small egg, or watch the complete metamorphisis of a caterpillar to name a few scenes.  My 4 year old son began to mimick the bug's trail imprints left in the sand. He stood up and danced to the music while imprinting his own tracks in the carpet. On another note: if you are sensitve or a bit squirmish, you might have a hard time watching a few gory scenes- bugs eating other bugs! I had to turn away a couple of times but my little boy thought it was funny and even reinacted some of the scenes in the movie by using a few of his own rubber bugs.",1356307200,,1091,4.422885572139304
2792421,5,B000O7861E,"Judy Dench of course is what really sells this little movie. I grew up in the Disney era so all
bugs,and creatures become sweet to me.
What set up the sad ending was how we had watched the little catapillar finally become a butterfly,
and Judy had said what a short life they had,maybe 2 to three weeks. Then oh,oh,there is the other star
of the show just waiting..and then we see the little wings float down stream. I cried...

I don't have grandkids so I don't know whether they are Disneyized or not.
I hope they are,although it gives you a life long over protection for every creature and bug
on the planet..

And the tears of course..
This was very well done..we have to show the kids not everything lasts forever for pete's sake.
But yes,I too did cry,even at 64.
I don't apologize for it.

As a kid,I rememeber an older lady sitting in front of us at the Lakewood theatre  crying at
Old Yeller. She was crying into her Kleenex and we thought it was pretty funny..
until the sad part really got going,and then we two cried along with the old lady.

That's probably one of the first Disney feature films I remember clearly as being so sad.",1329609600,,1144,4.352112676056338
2792422,5,B000O7861E,Bought this for my grandson because he loves bugs.  This video keeps him occupied and he carries it around with him most of the time.  He loves bugs..  always has...  He is 9.. Glad I could get it from Amazon..,1326240000,,210,4.175
2792423,5,B000O7861E,"I first rented this dvd and was so delighted that I decided to buy it so I could view it as often as I wished.  Very educational, but in a format that all ages can enjoy.  It is about the right length to keep children interested to the end. Hopefully there will be more like it made and hopefully Judi Dench will narrate them.  Totally delighted.",1310083200,,346,4.212121212121212
2792424,1,B000O7861E,"I agree with the reviewer above, Elizabeth.  My son loves bugs. He's obsessed.  He can't get enough bug movies... but this one is going in the vault with Star Wars until he's older.  He came down the stairs crying his eyes out that the praying mantis ate the butterfly.  And what makes it worse... they give the two insects names, so my son fell in love with them both.  ""He ate Peeo!  He ate Peeo!!!  Mom!!!!""  Then we went into a discussion about the cycle of life, death, etc. -- all I wanted was 45 minutes of mommy time, not a philosophy lesson with my toddler.",1308873600,7,566,4.273584905660377
2792425,5,B000O7861E,"My 6 year old child, who is easily distracted, can't get enough of this movie! Educational and entertaining. He asks about caterpillars and praying mantis all the time now. Amazing shots of the bugs",1303862400,,198,4.852941176470588
2792426,3,B000O7861E,"While this film is beautiful and informative, the storyline is, to quote my 7 year old, ""Lame!!"" Both my 5 and 7 year old, who love insect and bug movies/documentaries and haven't had trouble in the past when insects die, ended this movie weeping and angry.  The story follows a butterfly and a praying mantis from birth to maturity, calling them by name and going through all of the dangers and developments they face. After all of it, they choose to end it with the mantis eating the butterfly. The butterfly wings float down together and land in the stream and float off. Artistic it was. Maybe that's nice for adults, but I would have liked a little warning before watching it with my kids.",1297123200,27,694,4.552
2792427,5,B000O7861E,I LOVED this movie. The soundtrack was awesome and the story was done in a way that you connected with the characters. Judy Dench was the clencher. She has an incredible voice that made the story.,1281225600,,196,4.472222222222222

The picture quality and quality of work is probably perfect but end result is not enough for fascinating the viewers -seen the competition. In my opinion, the purpose of the film was not clear neither (was it: filming the insects as close as possible without any filming patterns or telling a story of a butterfly?). So, I give 3-stars only for the efforts and meticoulous film production.",1259625600,2,857,7.755102040816326

8183780,5,B000O7861E,"Excellent! I bought one for the elementary students in a school in Panam. They LIVE in a rainforest, so this is personally relevant to each child. Having both Spanish and English voice makes it useful in both science classes and in the English program.",1415750400,,252,4.75
8183781,5,B000O7861E,"I am surprised at the rating of ""Bugs!! A Rainforest Adventure"", as I found it to be a remarkable film, and keep it in my main library to show friends.

This film highlights the extraordinary world of insects, Bugs! Photography is just incredible, and at its best when it focuses on the life cycles of a praying mantis and a butterfly from their birth to their inevitable demise in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.

The film covers more than 40 tropical insects are featured, captured in minute detail for the first time ever in 3D Large Format. This is just remarkable photography.
You will see a caterpillar hatch from a single tiny egg to metamorphose into a butterfly, and watch as a praying mantis snaps up a fly for its dinner.
I noticed a few reviews complain this is not for children. I would just say this movie was made as a documentary...not a children's film. It shows actually life cycles of animals and that may not be what a mom or dad wants their children to see.
Don't miss this one...it truly is remarkable!",1394150400,2,1036,4.564516129032258
8183782,5,B000O7861E,"I purchased this movie for my 4th graders to watch during our unit on insects.  It held the attention of my typically rambunctious group of students.  The footage is beautiful.

 **Spoiler Alert** The praying mantis eats the butterfly.  This may be quite traumatic for some children, but my 4th graders were perfectly fine afterward and required no counseling services as a result.",1387238400,,381,5.080645161290323
8183783,5,B000O7861E,"This is a cute movie! We use it at our school's small bug fair and everyone gets a kick out of watching it! I wish there was more information describing bugs, but it makes up for it with gorgeous quality footage and by following insect life cycles!",1359331200,,248,4.297872340425532
8183784,4,B000O7861E,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who say that this video would have been better if they left out the part where the butterfly is eaten. Especially after they gave it a name and developed the story so my kids got to know and like the butterfly. The video footage is good and the close up shots are great.
