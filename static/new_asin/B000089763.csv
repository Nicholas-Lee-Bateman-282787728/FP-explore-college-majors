1830083,2,B000089763,"This disc has all the things you'd expect from a ""special features"" disc, but its missing the actual episodes. If you are obsessed with the characters on the show, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're like me and are hoping to get ideas for decorating, skip this one and wait until they release the seasons. I hope this isn't an indication of how the producers intend to trickle out bits and pieces of the show while charging fans a premium. Its a good show, but not that good.",1073433600,7,476,4.420454545454546
1830084,2,B000089763,"First of all, I have to agree with previous viewers that this DVD (in addition to the accompanying book) lacks in any effort to show the home improvement projects which their show is about! Instead, all focus is on the people involved. Personally, my main reason for watching Trading Spaces is to see the creative decorating and projects that are involved. (If you are more into the personalities involved then you may just enjoy this DVD.) My second objection to this DVD concerns the fact that there are several reveals which I felt were very worthy of being included with the worst and the best. What about the military man who insisted that they leave his carpet alone and didn't want dark colors but Hilde went ahead and took out the carpet and painted his walls black? That episode remains a classic in my eyes. Oh well.
Because there wasn't any focus on the decorating and several worthy episodes were excluded, you may be asking is it worth it buying this DVD? My verdict is no; and I consider myself to be a fan of this show. Personally, I borrowed this DVD from my sister and don't have any plans to add it to my DVD collection.
If you enjoy Trading Spaces be sure to catch Changing Rooms and Home Invaders both airing on BBC America. I learned much more decorating tips and don't have to deal with Paige.",1056326400,13,1315,4.506276150627615
1830085,2,B000089763,"I felt like Clara Peller after watching this DVD.  While promising bloopers, outtakes and such, it delivers very little.  Most of it was just show clips that actually aired, which provides the hardcore fan (to who I assume this DVD is aimed) nothing much more than what had already aired?  Where are the interviews?  Where are the actual bloopers?  where are the mishaps that had to occur over the 2 seasons?
This makes a good rental disc at best.  There is little if any rewatching value here.",1052697600,10,494,4.620689655172414
1830086,2,B000089763,"It's a menu of extras, fine in and of itself, but lacking in the meat of the show.  I paid twenty bucks to see something different and I feel let down.  I would like to see actual interviews with the designers and carpenters.  I would like to know more about the departure of Alex (and Des).  I want to know how to put together some of the more beautiful armoirs and shelves that Ty and Amy Wynn built.  I want to see shopping lists so when I try to recreate some of the rooms in my own home, I know what to get at the store and which store to look through.
I don't get any of that on this DVD.  Even the reveal montages are available on the other Trading Spaces DVDs.  Save your bucks unless you're a completist.",1052179200,16,713,4.05
1830087,1,B000089763,"I want my money back!!  Since I know that won't happen, I hope to SAVE any people from ordering this themselves.
Listen, I LOVE this show.  I tape it if I think I might miss it, even just a few minutes of it, but this DVD was NOT worth my time nor my money.  What a disappointment!!
I agree with Maryland's comment on the book...that is definetly worth the money.  Order the book, not this DVD!!",1050883200,19,395,4.157894736842105
1830088,3,B000089763,"This DVD plays like the ""special features"" portion of any DVD-- there just isn't any main feature to go with it. The 121 minutes playing time is the result of adding the umpteen little clip-shows together, plus, I would guess, the running time of the menu.
The clip selections are not bad, but they are certainly brief. Each current cast member gets a short featurette, and those do aa good job of capturing the flavor of that individual. And even though they include a ""history of..."" feature, Alex is completely ignored (Des, too, but I can almost understand that...)
So if you sit down with this, you'll work the remote a lot and be done in a couple of hours. Mixed feelings here-- if someone gave it to you as aa gift, you'd probably be delighted and enjoy it. But if you shell out your own money for it, you may end up feeling a bit cheated...",1050883200,7,848,4.407643312101911
1830089,5,B000089763,"I've seen basically every episode of ""Trading Spaces"" on TLC whenever I can (since my boyfriend and I currently don't have cable in our apartment, I don't get to see it as often as I wish).  Its one of my favorite shows on TV and I was really excited to hear of this DVD.
Since it was only a 'best of' DVD, all it was made up of was clips, but I didn't mind!  I loved it!!!!  I was really thrilled to see clips of the, as I call it, 'Spaz Guy Episode' (His name is Chris, I forget her name though) since it is one of the only episodes I HAVEN'T seen yet.
I can't say everyone will like this DVD if they like Trading Spaces, but I did and I at least recommend people finding away to see it.",1048896000,7,689,3.872340425531915

7980149,2,B000089763,"For some reason, I was under the impression that this DVD had full length episodes of Trading Spaces, but it is really only snippets of different episodes. It was not worth the money in my opinion.",1189382400,,197,4.5
7980150,3,B000089763,"I watched this DVD because I thought I'd learn something about decorating (can you tell I've seldom seen this TV series?).  Instead I learned that it is definitely not a good idea to turn over a room of your house to the producers of this show.  The DVD reveals the behind-the-scenes interactions between the decorators and worker-bee neighbors.  Although the decorators are fun and entertaining, some try to bully the neighbors into assisting with a makeover that the neighbors insist the homeowners will hate (and they are proved right).  A natural approach would be to detect the homeowners' taste and take it to another level.  Instead, the decorators seem to be asking themselves, how can I make this room dramatically different (thereby abandoning any pretense of pleasing the homeowners).  Even the section that purports to show the reactions of people who love their makeovers falls flat--anyone who can read faces knows that at least one spouse in most of those segments was unhappy or at least unimpressed.  I gave the DVD an intermediate rating because although it teaches little about decorating it would be educational for anyone considering applying for the show.",1174435200,2,1177,5.098958333333333
7980151,2,B000089763,"This DVD is almost as bad as the show has become. 99% of the designers should all be castigated for being selfish, self-centered emotional ""artists"" who DO NOT take into consideration the lifestyles and tastes of the homeowners. Yes, they're working with neighbors, but the designers rarely if ever listen to what the neighbors KNOW their friends are looking for. Have you looked at the faces of people who walk into the new rooms?!?!  The vast majority are stricken, feeling ill.

Where do they find these designers? They sure aren't ""Christopher Lowell"". There is a way to meld your style as a designer to the client, and if totally at odds, the client should prevail.  Boo hiss to this show. It's nothing but shock-value TV to me at this point.",1170460800,,747,4.730769230769231
7980152,2,B000089763,This footage was sooo short and only showed highlights.  The biggest disappointment was Ty Pennington was not shirtless in this DVD!,1120608000,3,132,5.285714285714286
