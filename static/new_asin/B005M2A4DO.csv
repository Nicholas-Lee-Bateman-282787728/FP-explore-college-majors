That said, I was struck by how little screen time polar bears got during the segment entitled ""Polar Bears""! But seen as a documentary about Arctic life, I thought it was very interesting. Just don't expect to learn much about polar bears. If polar bears is all you want then you should find something else. While I did enjoy and benefit from this as a general ""arctic life"" show, I will look for something else for more extensive polar bear content.

By the way, this disc also has programs that (mostly) focus on the kangaroo and the mongoose.

In terms of the quality of the disc itself, I would mostly point out that this does NOT seem to be high definition. I haven't seen this DVD, but I doubt that the quality of this blu-ray is any better than the DVD. But at least it was really cheap...",1393459200,,943,4.382857142857143
