I had a hard time deciding what was worse.  The acting?  The cinematography?  The awkwardly stilted dialog or the actors recruited from a local retirement home. So yourself a favor and keep looking.

Yes, the acting is pretty basic and the story is simple, but I'm hoping Justin and Amanda Barber, who wrote, produced and acted in this film, will write, produce and act in others in the future.

5901931,4,B00ECFEL2C,"This 1-hour movie was charming and thoughtful, with a powerful reinforcement of the value of friendship and respect of others. The overall tone though was bittersweet as it could be depressing one scene and heartwarming the next. It really makes one think about what is important in life and relationships. Some of my children thought it too slow paced but I enjoyed it and would watch it again! Appropriate for all though keep in mind the storyline involves death so younger children may need some parental guidance.",1462060800,,517,4.954022988505747

I shared some of her experiences of appreciating the life stories of the people I met, as well as the sadness of their passings. I hope I brought some joy to them with my bright, young smile and singing voice like Megan did! Now, I'm much older and have my own life story to tell. This movie prompted me to write down some of those stories. Each one of our lives is a precious gift. Thanks to the film makers for this sweet, refreshing film!",1456272000,,717,4.16546762589928

As a server you get to know them, and their personalities as well as the ordering preferences. This movie portrays the interaction of a cute young server who really cares with 3 old men. There is also her co-worker who, sadly to say, it the hack server, ""just serve them"", waitress.

5902157,5,B00ECFEL2C,"An unassuming, gentle little (48 minutes) film. No, its not Gone with the Wind, nor does it pretend to be. Its a story of three rather frail old men who meet regularly for breakfast in a local caf&eacute; and their interaction with a young college student waiting tables to finance her schooling. One of the men is a former piano teacher, one a former factory worker, the third grew up on a farm in Austria and retains vivid memories of the terrible effects the war had on his family. They appear to be of modest means, but enjoy each others company for their weekly breakfast. The waitress, who narrates the film, has an open heart and it rapidly fills with the eccentricities, disabilities, and habits of the old men. Many scenes are quite touching. It all seems quite real, even to the extent that nothing dramatic happens. Dramatic events rarely do happen in real life.

Some reviewers say that this is a fine Christian movie. It may be that, but you don't have to be Christian to enjoy it and receive its message. In fact, theres only one short but moving segment where Jesus is named. For the rest, be kind and generous to others and you will be yourself enriched, is a message common to decent people of all faiths and no formal faith. This is also a film which you can watch with anybody without fearing to be embarrassed  there is no strong language or the slightest suggestion of sexuality  though it might be too slow for the very young.",1447459200,4,1448,4.519083969465649

Befriending her customers who happened to be old and understanding their feelings was a fresh breath of air. The process of getting old is difficult and people tend to discard the elderly unfortunately. She was different and listened to their problems and difficulties with great patience. These virtues are instilled by a strong family base and excellent parenting which was not a large part of the movie but evident in her demeanor. Her patience was deafening and her boss, the restaurant owner must have been cut from the same cloth. He understood a lot about life and was willing to listen to her suggestions and seemed to understand the human condition well. It was a short movie but there were a lot of things going on in a very small setting. Would be nice for young people to see so they can understand the other side of things instead of just seeing older people as biding their time before leaving this earth.

Complicated customers. *** Spoiler follows. *** As each of the old jewish octogenarian breakfast group each kicks the bucket, realizations are made about appreciation of history and those around us while living.

I saw it as a corny breakfast club movie and the characters were more than moderately boring. The movie was filmed entirely in Michigan and the 'small town' setting was interesting.

5902347,5,B00ECFEL2C,"I really enjoyed this movie for a few reasons, In my younger years I spent 27 years being in the restaurant business, starting as
a waitress, it was very hard work and long hours of being on your feet. I loved it! The hustle and bustle, the adrenal pumping of getting
everything done right, the friendliness of regular customers. I saw myself in this movie like they were telling my story. Customers were more
like friends and yes you really cared about them, and you would notice if someone didn't come in for a day or two.
I would look out the window and say here comes a grilled cheese with tomato with a cup of soup. People are creatures of habit.
I would put many orders in before they walked in the door and sat down. When it came to the elderly and I knew they would have a problem
opening those little jelly's I would come over and say here let me peel your grapes and rip off the seal for them, and we would all laugh.
And for the younger construction men that would come in and sit at the counter and never tip, I would make them laugh by saying come on gentlemen, this is NOT a non-profit organization and from then on they always tipped. If someone didn't have enough money to eat, I would put
it on a slip with my name and pay for it from my tips at the end of my shift.
This movie was done with such heart and true to life circumstances and it's about being human and caring for others, which takes you out
of yourself and realize you care about the other people around you and what happens to them.
I've seen and felt the hurt when a customer is stricken with illness or dies.
This was not just a movie of being kind to the elderly, It was about tolerance and consideration for all people.

I think too that anyone considering going into the restaurant business weather as a server or owner they should know it's not about money,
It's about people and if you don't like to cater to people then they should consider another profession. I always made a great living working as
a waitress and never worried about money because I cared about people and when they got to know me they cared about me too.
I bought and sold three restaurants in those 27 years and made many friends and lost a few too.",1431820800,12,2209,4.234597156398104

It was just a simple story from a young person's point of view. How a summer changed her opinion about looking through the rough exteriors, understanding how people get to where they are personality-wise, and digging in to find the beauty in all of us. I knew where the movie was going when she impatiently passed a car with an old lady driving, only to have the woman scowl. I would have thought the movie was a little goody-goody, except the lead was convincing as a sweet girl with a lesson to learn one summer. We have all had summers in our youth like that. Loved the part about her ""beautiful teeth"". I liked the music as it fit the mood of the movie.

Exposition narration that should have been used more sparingly, and letting the script tell the story.  This could have easily been a 90 minute film with a fuller script, revealing the Club members and the development of their relationship with themselves and with the waitress.

So when the gentlemen began sharing their stories in brought tears to my eyes.  That was a time that so many dealt with, and we have no clue to the suffering, and life changes that had to be made.

I never forget about what my mother went through as a young woman...and even tho' her life was deeply affected by the war, I wanted to do so much for her when she was getting to old to be on her own.  She was hard to deal with at times, because of her independent attitude.  But it was that determination that got her thru some hard times.  Such as moving  and learning how to live in the States.

It would be wonderful if young ones could understand that Older People were young once too.  We had hopes, dreams and aspirations that sometimes didn't come true.  Truth is, even tho' we are all slowly dying and aging...One will never truly know until that times comes.  But it's the wise one, you can at least begin to understand and show some respect and appreciation.

The young lady who intuitively seems to know, what these gentlemen need, is absolutely charming.

Small children would be bored but for those in their 30's and up this movie definitely gives one the inclination to pause and reflect on the passages of time and life.",1425081600,,553,4.435643564356436

This movie reminded me why I became a nurse. Like Megan, the crotchety ones always became a challenge to me & I was more than rewarded by those friendships. There are so many things that we can learn from the elderly if only we would take the time to get to know them. I think Megan discovered this truth a long the way as she got to know these elderly men. My heart broke for her in the end because I knew exactly how she felt. This was a beautiful story and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

The story line gripped my heart. The writing of, Amanda Barber  was superb, as was the directing by Justin Barber. Whoever did the casting did a wonderful job. The actors, the talented David Cade, and the older gentleman, Heinrich Roth, Nathan Goldwin, and Ricky Lombardo worked well with the two young and talented actresses, Stacey Bradshaw, and Amanda Barber. Their performances couldn't have been any better. The film reveals what most of us gave up on, or have lost in the past decades. I for one was compelled by The Wednesday Morning Breakfast Club to come out of my complacency concerning the elderly among us. The behind the scenes interviews are just a fabulous as the film itself. I plan to purchase this film for as many people as I possibly can. I also plan to donate this great film to my local library. I highly recommend The Wednesday Morning Breakfast Club to people of all ages, young and old alike. Families, and Church groups would do well to view it together.",1389312000,8,1139,4.666666666666667

5902542,5,B00ECFEL2C,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

This is a film that I would heartily recommend for families with children of all ages.

It gave so much to think about, such as the biblical principles of honoring elders, being patient, and being generous, and the film accomplished this through laughter, tears, and even a moment of heart-stopping action.

The musical arrangements were fantastic, always so perfectly timed and well executed.

But, I have to say, my favorite part was watching Megan (Stacey Bradshaw) grow over the course of the movie. It was very interesting to see how that was portrayed though her own narration. In the beginning she moves past things that seem difficult (the breakfast club, a group of three persnickety older men) and grows to not simply deal with their crankiness, but come to love them, and be moved by their lives.

I shan't spoil it, but get tissues. This is a beautifully crafted story, wonderfully done, and it will leave you with a heart full of thankfulness for the time you have today.",1385164800,23,1017,4.82183908045977
