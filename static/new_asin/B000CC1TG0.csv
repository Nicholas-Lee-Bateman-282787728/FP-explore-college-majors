8096779,5,B000CC1TG0,"This new comedy performance DVD produced by Jason Dudek (Open Mic with Dave Chappelle) showcases 4 bright stars rising on the comedy horizon.  The Laugh Factory in LA is known for discovering the next big thing.  Anyone of these guys could be it.  Some of the comics who got their start at the Laugh Factory include Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and Chris Rock.  Bob Marley (Mad TV, no relation to the reggae star,), Ruben Paul (Deliver Us From Eva, Comedy Central), Butch Bradley (Open Mic) and Freddy Soto (Three Amigos, Spanglish) deliver lots of big laughs in each of their 20-minute sets.  Unfortunately Freddy Soto died shortly after this gig.  This probably was his last recorded performance.  All 4 comedy acts were filmed in Hi-Definition digital video. The picture and sound quality are both perfect.",1143504000,9,803,4.9037037037037035
