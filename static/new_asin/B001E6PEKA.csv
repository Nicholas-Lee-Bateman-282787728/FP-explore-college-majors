8296856,1,B001E6PEKA,"In the late 70's an anime company released a wonderful movie adaptation of Aladdin's adventures in 1001 Arabian Nights.  It was given the title Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp.
This rendition of Aladdin was AMAZING.  It was very (suspiciously?) similar in story and plot to the Disney movie that came out in the 90's (kinda like Kimba the white lion...) except it had even more twists and turns.  Like when the evil wizard traps Aladdin in the cave of wonders, Aladdin escapes with the aid of a magic ring that he finds that has a lesser genie in it; later Aladdin has to figure out how to use his less powerful magic to overcome the evil sorcerer by getting the two genies to do battle, it was SWEET.
What I recieved in this DVD however was not the cherished movie from my childhood.  Instead the Phoenix Learning Group bought the rights to this feature length movie and edited it into a 10 minute animated short for use in schools.  Needless to say paying $17 for a 10 minute DVD that completely trashed one of my favourite childhood memories was not worth it at all.  I cannot reccomend this title or company at all.  I'd give less than 1 star if I could.",1239494400,16,1157,4.429245283018868
