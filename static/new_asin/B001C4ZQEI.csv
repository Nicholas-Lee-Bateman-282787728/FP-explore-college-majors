3505511,5,B001C4ZQEI,like many of you i bought this due to never getting to finish it on television. it brought back old memories and it well worth displaying in my collection of anime. the one flaw i had with this is you need to own the third volume to finish the complete dark tournament which was no problem for me because i bought them all at once but just warning those who are purchasing this product to take that into consideration. You will not be disappointed in this purchase if you love yu yu hakusho or just anime in general.,1259280000,,516,4.275510204081633

3505513,5,B001C4ZQEI,The dark tournament is under way and the team must fight or die! A continuation of one of the most popular anime titles ever made at a price anyone can afford.,1230940800,,159,4.161290322580645
3505514,4,B001C4ZQEI,"Yu Yu Hakusho, my third favorite anime, is being released in these wonderful season sets just like DBZ. This box set makes brings the episode count up to half the entire series!

I'll start off by saying that the packaging hasn't changed from Season 1's box, which of course is predictable. This is a good thing, as the four discs are packed into two thin cases, making the set compact and versatile for space.

One particular flaw with the set appears in all these sets, unfortunately. There is no Marathon feature which allows you to view all the episodes on the disc in order, but removes the ""coming next episode"" animation, plus the opening and closing credits. FUNimation does this for DBZ and even One Piece which only comes in 13 episode sets! With so many episodes per disc, this seems like an obvious addition, but alas.

Otherwise, the only extras are character profiles and trailers.

Now lets get to the good, shall we?

The entire set focuses on the Dark Tournament Saga. More than half the saga is covered in this set. The fights include: the remaining battles with Team Rokuyoukai, led by the charmingly drunk Chu, Team Ichigaki, three powerful students seemingly controlled by a devious scientist, Team Masho, ninja-like warriors who specialize in elemental combat, and Team Uraotogi, a team of flamboyant fighters using very unique weapons. The set ends as the first battle with Team Toguro comes to a close.

Along the way, Yusuke is confronted by his team's own Masked Fighter who reveals her true self. The identity is very predictable, and it isn't surprising, but it leads Yusuke to take part in a memorable test to prove he is capable of defeating the wicked Toguro. In this test, Yusuke absorbs a ball of pure, concentrated energy, which owing to its power, puts Yusuke in an extreme state of pain. The screams of Justin Cook, Yusuke's English VA, are so convincingly painful that you just can't look away. And the death of a particular teammate brings tragedy and resolve to Yusuke, as the dying tells Yusuke of Toguro's abandonment of his humanity.

Of course, this wouldn't be Yu Yu Hakusho without comic relief. Key comedic moments include the hatching of Yusuke's spirit egg which revealing a less than intimidating creature of hilarious design, a hard pressed battle for Kuwabara which results in hilarious victory after seeing the face of the girl he loves, and two particularly entertaining scenes with Yusuke and Keiko, the first where Yusuke gets slapped hard after inappropriately touching Keiko's behind, remarking its attractiveness, and the second involving Keiko watching over his sleeping body while their friends suggest ""taking advantage"" of the situation.

The episodes are not without fault, though. The fight with Team Ichigaki is a little too uninteresting, and Ichigaki himself partakes of the ""anime bad guy"" laugh too much. The fight between Chu and Yusuke starts well, but, unlike the manga, the fight concludes with Keiko making an attempt to stop the fight whilst learning about pride among fighters, instead of being a fast paced brawl without interruption. On top of those, not everyone in the cast is perfect, in both English and Japanese. I generally prefer Japanese dialog, but the original cast has a bad habit of disappointing me a lot. On the other hand, the English dub has a wonderful cast for the main recurring characters, but sometimes falls short on the minor ones.

But if Japanese is still your thing, the subtitles are quite accurate. I know this because they resemble a fan-sub, keeping the honorific suffixes, and translating the name of every item. Unfortunately, like the original cast, the subtitles disappoint me. Not because they're bad, but because it shows how largely unoriginal the Japanese dialog is. Several characters give the same tired lines used in similar situations in just about every other shonen title out there. It makes you appreciate the random jokes and quirks that FUNimation put in their script to give the characters more personality.

Otherwise, this set is worth every penny, considering the price, which is less than a dollar per episode. Pick this up and all the others. The plot is basic, but the characters, the flashy battles, loud sound effects, and memorable music make this series a classic.",1226793600,,4300,4.968011126564673
3505515,3,B001C4ZQEI,"I really enjoyed this season. but I wish that they had finished the tournament, instead of stopping before the finals were over because there were still three fights to go!",1224892800,,172,4.766666666666667
3505516,4,B001C4ZQEI,"""Yu Yu Hakusho's"" first season ended with Yusuke and his buddies coming to the Dark Tournament, determined to fight their way to the finals, and defeat Toguro's team.

So it's pretty clear what the second season consists of --  a string of one-on-one fights, with Yusuke and his buddies fighting a series of increasingly dangerous enemies. There's not a great deal of central plot beyond this, but the evolving powers of Team Urameshi -- as well as some cloak-and-dagger machinations -- keep things interesting.

After Kuwabara barely survives his opening bout with the creepy child Rinku, his teammates square off against other members of Team Rokuyukai -- Kurama is blackmailed during his bout and must use his wits to survive, Yusuke dukes it out with a drunken warrior, and Hiei unleashes a devastating fire attack called Dragon of the Darkness Flame.

But things take a nasty turn when they fight Team Ichigaki, a group of human martial artists being controlled by a malignant scientist. The kindhearted Kuwabara can't bring himself to hurt three innocents even if they are out to kill him -- and the mysterious Masked Fighter may be their only hope. But Team Urameshi aren't done yet -- first they must fight a lethal gang of ninja demons, then a bunch of ""fairy tale"" figures with lethal talents. But one of those talents causes an unexpected change in Kurama.

Meanwhile, the Masked Fighter reveals her true identity, and puts Yusuke through his final test, which will give him enough power to go head-to-head with Toguro... if it doesn't kill him first. But then Toguro commits a shocking murder, and Yusuke becomes determined to fight and kill him -- now out of revenge, rather than fear. But does Team Urameshi really have a chance to defeat Team Toguro?

The first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" basically consisted of a string of smaller adventure arcs, with Yusuke working to vanquish the villain of the week. But the second series takes a very different format -- instead we get a series of one-on-one fights. It sounds a bit monotonous, but the various superpowers -- and some interesting side subplots -- keep it from being so.

The fights themselves are pretty colorful -- killer plants, ice, blood, magic capes, fire dragons, tiny tornados, killer robots, and a box that deages its victim. So needless to say, the battles are fairly interesting and there's really no way of telling how some of them will turn out. The whole subplot about Dr. Ichigaki and his helpless guinea pigs is pretty wrenching, although the ending is a bit limp.

But equally interesting are the stories outside the ring -- Toguro and his equally villainous partner Sakyo are doing some behind-the-scenes scheming, and cause a little bloodbath of their own. It adds a bit of spice to Team Urameshi's forthcoming battles with Team Toguro, because a lot more than their lives are now riding on their victory.

Yusuke has a lot of growth in this particular season -- not only is he a top-notch fighter, but he also struggles to absorb a new source of power from an old friend. And he gets his Spirit Beast, which turns out to be... a blue penguin with spaniel ears. But when someone close to him dies, Yusuke's rage and anger are pretty palpable.

His friends also have some power-ups -- Hiei trains himself to exhaustion, so he can master his new technique. And though he usually uses wits and plants alone, Kurama briefly turns back into a cold-blooded, silver-haired demon fox. Kuwabara is the only one who doesn't change much, but he serves as the kind heart of the team -- and some comic relief, such as when he sees his beloved Yukina watching his fight.

The second season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is basically an escalating string of supernatural fights, but it's colorful enough to not be monotonous -- and the grand finale promises to be even more so.",1215993600,7,3839,4.783987915407855

He can move, he can jab, he can keep them coming. But the one element that stands out for me is the younger Toguro. Unlike a lot of villains, while Toguro dreams of power and control, he doesn't seem to let it go completely to his head. And he sure knows how to call out every human for his greed and foolishness. While this season is enjoyable to watch, certainly if you count the flight Botan moments, it is also kind of a downer because Yusuke's feisty master cannot tag along forever.

3505575,5,B001C4ZQEI,"The best season in the entire series with the best story arc! Here is my review for Yu Yu Hakusho season 2!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) season 2 really starts at episode 26 which comes in the first season in this version but i will give an up to date idea of what happened. After Yusuke's last mission he is out with his friends Kuwabara and Keiko. Yusuke is met by a biker/deamon named Toguro who he faught in a eariler case. Thinking he wants a rematch Yusuke and Toguro go to a parking guarge, Toguro tells Yusuke that he wasn't using his full power or even half his power last time they were fighting, Toguro powers up and demolishes the parking guarge in seconds leaving Yusuke in total fear of how strong Toguro is. Toguro tells Yusuke that he must enter in this fighting tournament called The Dark Tournament, If Yusuke refuses enter Toguro tells him that he will kill Yusuke and everyone Yusuke knows and has ever cared for. Now Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei, and Kurama and a mysterious masked figure enter the tournament and fight for their lives.

Pros: This is the absoulte best story arc in the entire show! It has tons and tons of action, drama, story telling. Honstly this season and episodes deserves an award for how good it is. This dvd version is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you get all the kicks, punches, blood and action you need to see to enjoy the show. The voice acting is amazing! The old style of how the show looks makes it feel even better.

Cons: The only problem I had with this is the physical dvd's. I got this dvd packaged totally plastic wrapped and when I opened it some of the disc's had some light scratches on the back. After playing the dvd they turned out to be alright and all so just a warrning.

Season 1 and Season 2 and Season 3 episode mini mix up: This is just telling you that season two (aka the Dark Tournament) really starts at episode 25 which was put into the  S1 box instead of the S2 box. Its just a heads up. Also this box S2 only goes up to episode 56 and the true end of of the Dark Tournament ends at episode 66 which happens in S3 disc 2 so technally the entire 1st half S3 is still the Dark tournament.

Over all: I love love love this season more than any of the other season of Yu Yu Hakusho! This simple is the best every! BUY THIS SERIES!!!!!",1454803200,3,2313,4.281464530892449

Definitely a teen rated anime, though.  There is cursing every once in a while and a lot of fighting and violence.  Season 2 is where things really start to pick up story wise, too.

3505619,3,B001C4ZQEI,"After receiving a personal invitation to compete in The Dark Tournament; Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara, and a masked fighter are battling in the first round. Their goal is to meet Team Toguro in the finals. However, they aren't fighting for some type of status, this is a fight for their lives because Toguro has vowed to kill them should they lose. - summary

Yu Yu Hakusho Season Two contains episodes 29 - 56, and it follows up the previous season in the heat of battle. The previous season headed towards the end, with the powerful demon Toguro throwing his fight to Yusuke and Kuwubara. He re-appears alive and well, and forces them to compete in the Dark Tournament; this is a demon sponsored event where killing your opponent is highly encouraged and mercy is heavily looked down upon. Yusuke and Kuwubara partner up with their pals and head to the fight of their lives.

While the first season focused a little more on character development and actually had some type of stories to them. This follows the old Dragon Ball - World Tournament format, where the heroes are competing in a type of ladder match to battle against the top bad guy. The plot is pure and simple; fight, win, move on to the next fight. If they lose, then their main enemy Toguro will kill them. This isn't exactly bad material when taking into account the type of series YYH is at its core. If it's straight up action you're looking for then you have it right here.

 The animation is on par with the previous volume. It really didn't improve much, and several of the fights use the reused cel format, in other words, lots of scenes with super fast speed and quick punching. Pretty entertaining for its time, some actually love that now, unfortunately it rarely moves me. Many times I was bored during some of the scenes, but don't get me wrong, there are moments when the action does excel through various light-filled spectacles and some decent fight choreography followed up with brutal killings. The soundtrack fits well with the action, and the English cast has a very entertaining flow to it, excluding the constant annoyance which is the voice acting for Kuwabara voiced by Christoper R. Sabat. In all fairness though, it's not actually his fault as if he sucks or something. The voice directing is completely to blame here as it forces him into being the comic relief.

 Strange when you think about it, Yu Yu Hakusho is a fighting anime through and through, so I'm sure it's weird when I say that the sub-plots and revelations of character's past and purposes over shadows the action various times, which is something that occurs regularly as the series progresses. I found myself far more entertained with the stories surrounding the characters and even their personalities. And when getting on the subject of the characters, there appears to be this clashing going on which is all too noticeable. Yusuke being the hero and the star, is by far less interesting than the side characters. Hiei, Kurama, and especially Genkai in this arc, have far more potential to be better characters than he is. Yusuke doesn't seem to change, and his lack of thinking and dim-witted nature grew old for me fast. It was a refreshing feel whenever those three took the focus, to the point where I forgot Yusuke was even gone whenever he wasn't around. On top of this, Kuwabara fails miserably as the comic relief, and I find it strange that the series pulls off the comedy a lot better when it's not really trying.

 This second season indeed has its flaws. Some of the fight scenes really didn't appeal to me at all, while others were just too good. Overall, this season is a far cry from being bad, as it's entertaining enough for what it is.",1413590400,,3717,4.672782874617737

3505638,5,B001C4ZQEI,Great Series remastered in Blu-Ray excellently. It's an entire series I think every anime fan should own. I have a lot of non anime fans that love this show.,1395964800,,157,4.448275862068965
3505639,5,B001C4ZQEI,"This is not only one of my favorite anime shows growing up, it was one of my first ones that weren't so mainstream (i.e. Yu-Gi-Oh, Digimon, Pokemon, etc...). I honestly never got the chance to see the 4th/final season (trust me, I will soon enough...) but my all time favorite season is definitely season 2, The Dark Tournament Saga.

Quite honestly if you're even looking to purchase this box set than you need no explanation of the plot, the show or anything about this; you very well know already and it's been talked about plenty enough as is, but for the very unlikely chance someone doesn't know the plot here's a quick synopsis: Yusuke and team (Kuwabara, Kurama and Hiei) travel to a remote island to compete in the Dark Tournament against teams of competing demons and apparitions to have a rematch against the powerful demon Toguro.

I can't express enough how much I love this show and especially this season; this for me is the apex of the entire series (feel free to disagree...), brutal fighting, a slew of different characters/challengers, edge-of-your-seat action, some quirky comedy thrown in for good measure and a gut wrenching (though obvious) tragic plot point stemming from the death of a prominent character (no spoilers...not really...but you get what I mean...). Aside from that, I am reviewing the Blu-ray ver. so as far as video quality it's as vibrant and clear as you'd come to expect, obviously more so than the original analog, along with that the audio is clear as well. Though somewhat minimalistic as far as special features/extras go (just the opening and closing music with the scenes without text) I guess that's to be expected, and honestly is inconsequential.

My only real gripe is this, there's a bit of false advertising to address here, the box clearly says ""The Complete Second Season"". Unfortunately it's not the ""complete"" second season, as its a whopping 41 episodes in total, and this set only contains 28 of the episodes spread across 3 discs. It starts on the episode 29 ""Flowers of Blood"", 3 episodes past the initial start of the season and ends with episode 56 ""Yoko's Magic"" ending 10 episodes before the initial end. It's extremely annoying that I didn't get to start the season properly and watch the most climatic part of the series. And honestly I would've been happy just having this season if I'd only have one. But really it's not a big deal, it just gives me a reason to own the other seasons too, which you can't really say is a bad thing.

Overall, this series, and this season is a must have for any fan of anime. Just remember if you just get this season, you'll be missing out on 13 episodes.",1395878400,2,2659,4.711827956989247

It contains episodes 29-56, which in actuality isn't the whole second season. The whole second season consist of eps. 26-66, this would be my only complaint, sadly unlike it's advertised (The Complete Second Season) it does not contain the whole second season, it doesn't even finish off the Dark Tournament.

Sound and Video quality are excellent for DVD and the packaging is neat slim and organized into 4 DVD's inside 2 separate thin cases within the main cardboard cover case. These were new and had the plastic covering still intact. I was pleased with the price, product, and shipping speed. This volume is the second of four (total?) in the series and is a fun series to watch. It isn't as dark and serious as one may see in other anime series (i.e. ""Claymore"") but would fit nicely beside the ""Tenchi Muyo"" set. If you haven't seen ""Tenchi Muyo"" (and all the other DVD's in the set) I'd recommend those as good pleasant viewing as well.",1363132800,,791,4.351351351351352

The first season's strengths were always it's fast pace, character development, and interesting atmosphere. However, the second season really focuses on the ""Dark Tournament"" arc. The plot centers around ""Team Urameshi"" fighting against other demon teams in a win-or-die competition.

However, It beings to suffer from the Dragon Ball Z syndrome of too much dialog and dead time. There were several episodes were nothing major happened and even a few episodes where next to nothing happened at all. The dark tournament arc also continues on after this box set ends, so you're left with an incomplete saga that ends jagged and awkwardly. If you're a fan of the series, you can't help but get this, but be aware you'll have to buy season three as well to see how it ends, and you probably won't be as impressed as you were with the first.",1363046400,,942,4.709090909090909

Not to mention, when Toonami ran it during their afternoon block.

I'm very pleased with these seasons so far. My only complaint is that he episodes are broken up a little strangely (when one saga has ended another begins before the next season starts or the season ends before the saga).

3505721,5,B001C4ZQEI,"In my opinion, a Yuyu Hakusho review goes hand in hand with a sailor moon or dragon ball z review. The format of all of these shows is pretty much the same with small differences, granted the obvious ones (characters, time period, etc.) There is something about that period and genre that does a fantastic job of balancing great action, strong dynamic characters, supernatural influence, humor and teenage angst. Usually teen angst is very hard to pull of properly, for my taste, and ends up being a slow repetitive song that's ending is as predictable as it's beginning.

The blu-ray itself is looks good. I haven't noticed any problems with the outlining (something that has been proven to be a learning curve on the HD upsample of these pieces originally animated in SD.) The sound is also solid and as it stands, the only thing left to be desired is really special features. While it has the standard text-less opening/closing and trailer. Other than those though, there really are few others.

While there are other factors to consider, these are my points of why I feel that this is a well deserved addition to your collection

*IMPORTANT TO KNOW*
I'm reviewing this after having viewed the DVD version, and having just bought a 46"" Samsung LED TV.

I must say....that I'm rather disappointed in this blu-ray ""remastering.""

The Positive:
-The iconic, classic soundtrack sounds AMAZING
-The colors have been restored and are FANTASTIC
-4:3 ratio has been kept, so you see the anime as it was CREATED
-Very crisp, clean detail in image

The Negative (and in my eyes, a HUGE negative)
-This is not really a frame-by-frame ""back to analog"" remastering (or in my eyes is not). What bugs me the most (maybe because I expected it) is that there is a TON of dirt on the analog that they didn't clean. Therefore, you are PLAGUED by glittering white spots, and even occasional tears or hair. This also gets WORSE throughout the series, particularly during the Dark Tournament! The colors are great, so ""Black shadows"" are truly black, but there is so much dirt that they left behind that the blackness shimmers with white specks!

Now please, don't get me wrong. This is a great series that is being sold at a great price and, in my mind, is worth buying. However, TRUST ME in saying that this isn't a true remastering such as seen by Disney (such as the Lion King) or the brilliant remasterings of the James Bond films. I UNDERSTAND that it would take forever to digitally remove all the dirt, but they could have AT LEAST gone back to the analog, cleaned it, then ran it through the converter.

I must give this product a 3 out of 5. In all honesty, I give it a 1 out of 5 for the ""Remastering,"" but I give this series, plus the appealing price, plus the great color and sound a 5 out of 5. I recommend this series, but if you are like me, you will be annoyed by all the ""dirt"" on the footage.

(BTW, these dirt spots are apparent throughout the DVD version. The quality is much better on the Blu-ray overall, but the dirt was not removed)

I hope this review helps. I feel like all the ""most helpful reviews"" on this product are very poor reviews or are too biased to mention this.

I expected the second season blu-ray release to have been better produced than the first season. This release was okay. Besides looking brighter, the major difference is only really seen in the theme song before each episode. I don't understand how someone can release a blu-ray with so many visual flaws. It is extremely distracting to watch specks dance across the screen, the animation was not cleaned up enough in my opinion.  Justin Cook boasts that this release of the second season had a character name change; the clown known in the original release as Sazuka, has been 'fixed' to Sazuki. Cook claimed that they had completely re-recorded all lines which mentioned Sazuki by name, that sadly was untrue. There are obvious errors which went unnoticed. What I do appreciate was that both blu-ray releases have synched the English voice-overs to the animation well.

Funimation put too many episodes on each bluray (8-9 in most cases), so the bitrate is not as high as it could have been, compared to the Region A Japan release, of which I've seen screenshots.

Also, Funimation did its usual abysmal job with the subtitles, making lots of spelling and punctuation errors, using the wrong word, duplicate words, missing words, iffy translations...the bluray subs are actually a little worse than the dvd subs. Funimation should have taken the dvd subs and used a simple spell-checker. That would have caught perhaps 50% of their spelling errors, and would have made the release better at the cost of only a little time.

The audio is the only feature with which I have no complaints. I used a Sony Dolby 7.1 receiver with some good speakers and a subwoofer, and the series sounded great in both English and Japanese.

The space saving is nice - on the first two sets, 6 blurays in 2 cases for 56 eps (1/2 the series) could have replaced my old Dark Tournament set, original volume 8, and sets 3 and 4 of the 2-disc dvd release.

If I were grading only the anime series, naturally it would receive a perfect score.  But as to do the box set, there are things that would have made the Blu-ray better.

My largest complaint is the odd start/stop points for season 2.  I know that the entire Dark Tournament saga could not fit on an entire box set without skewing the number of episodes of season 3 & 4, but they could have at least picked up at more appropriate points in the series instead of within fights.  For this particular box set, if they would have set the beginning 3 episodes back and the ending point 2 episodes back, it would have made for more appropriate timing.  This would set season 2 at the beginning of the Dark Tournament saga and ending before the suspenseful fight with Team Toguro.

There's not much to the packaging.  I was hoping for a booklet with character bios or episode listings, but instead the episodes are listed in the inside of the front cover flap, which is little weird.  There are 3-discs to this collection, making more compact than the DVD's.

The Blu-ray menu is set up similar to that of the Dragon Ball Z box sets.  There are options for original subtitles or Japanese audio.  The ""Play All"" feature has each episodes with its intro song, commentary and outro song and commentary.  It would be nice if similar to the DBZ DVD sets they made a Marathon feature that skipped these parts.  It's a minor inconvenience, not really a huge complaint.

Overall, this is really solid collection.  The Blu-ray quality is fantastic (definitely use an HDMI cable), and there are a few noticeable changes in dialogue.  I would highly recommend this to any fans of the series.",1314489600,7,2598,4.620915032679738

The first three episodes of the second season appeared on the first box set, and the last ten episodes of the second season were put onto the box set for the third season.  The first disc of the set contains eight episodes; however, the DVD box only lists seven episodes on the disc.  The second disc contains six episodes; however, the box claims this disc has seven episodes.  The third disc contains eight episodes, and the fourth disc contains six episodes.

On the first disc, the only ""extra"" is a link that takes you to a menu for trailers.  The trailers available to view on this disc are for the FUNimation Channel, Black Cat, Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Ohki, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Lupin III.

The second disc has three extras.  The first consists of character profiles, which are a single page for each character with an accompanying picture.  On this disc, there are profiles for Roto, Kurama, Zeru, Hiei, Chu, Yusuke, M1 M2 M3, Masked Fighter, Dr. Ichigaki, Younger Toguro, Botan, Keiko (misspelled as Kayko), Ruka, Butajiri, Gama, Touya, Baken, Kuwabara, Risho, Jin, and Yukina.  Textless Songs has the same opening as the opening on the first box set, but includes the new closing that appears during the second season.  There are also trailers for Full Metal Panic!, The Galaxy Railways, Yu Yu Hakusho, Shinobi, and the Z-Store.

The only ""extra"" on disc three are trailers.  However, instead of being able to choose the trailers from a menu, it goes straight into a collection of trailers that play in one continuous piece.  The trailers included in this feature are for the FUNimation Channel, Baki the Grappler: Last Blood, The Galaxy Railways, Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie: Conqueror of Shambala, and Full Metal Panic! Second Raid.

The fourth disc has three extras.  The first is more character profiles, done in the exact same style as the profiles on disc two.  On this disc are profiles for Makintaro, Kuro Momotaro, Juri, Hiei, Genkai, Yusuke, Onji, Suzuka, Puu, Yoko Kurama, Shishi Wakamaru, Ura Urashima, Kuwabara, Bui, Younger Toguro, Team Gorenja, Elder Toguro, Sakyo, Karasu, Koenma, and Botan.  The textless songs that appear on this disc are exactly the same as what appears on disc two.  The trailers available on this disc are for Samurai 7, Origin, Yu Yu Hakusho, Burst Angel, and the Z-Store.

The tone of the series definitely changes in this box set when compared to the episodes that appeared on the previous set.  The second season of Yu Yu Hakusho definitely becomes more of a fighting anime along the lines of Dragon Ball Z.  I wish that FUNimation had gone to more effort with the special features on this set; however, even with the relative lack of bonus material, I would still recommend this set to fans of Yu Yu Hakusho, especially if they're interested in owning the series on DVD.

In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD set that I purchased for my husband as a gift.",1291075200,,3090,4.808712121212121
3505737,5,B001C4ZQEI,"On a whim I decided to buy every episode of this anime, remembering how much I liked it years ago when it aired on toonami. I thought I may have grown out of it since then, and was worried this may have been a bad purchase. Thankfully, these worries were completely wrong. This anime is as good as I remember, and everything I hoped it would be. Amazon has it at an amazing price. (I picked up all 4 seasons, over 40 hours of anime, for under $80) The quality is great, it comes with both english and Japanese voices with subtitles for whatever you prefer, and some few fun extras. If you are on the line, considering whether or not to get this series, I highly recommend it. It was everything I hoped and remembered it being.",1289347200,,726,4.268115942028985
3505738,4,B001C4ZQEI,"Yu Yu Hakusho is a classic series of which I've been a fan of since I was a little girl, and a long series at that.  So, I was ecstatic to find the complete series. I won't review the series here  (there's a wiki page for it and plenty of online reviews for the show itself), just the box set.

Packaging:
Overall, I would have preferred a single box set, but considering the series length, the four sets take up very little self space.  Each season is two thinpaks (each containing two discs) in a slim, thin box.  Honestly, I wish the box covers were a bit thicker and sturdier, these will tear and show wear quite easily I'm afraid.  Each season has a different character theme for the box and thinpaks, Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, etc, and character themes for set of menus on the dvd's.  Every inch of the box sets are covered in nice art, from beautiful line art on the inside of the thinpaks to colorful group artwork on the covers; the only undecorated space is the dvd's themselves, which are white with minor detail, but it's a nice bit of symmetry and simplicity to contrast the rest of the detailed and colorful packaging.

Dvd's:
The dvd's themselves are fairly simple; the sound and picture quality is excellent in both English and Japanese, and there are two sets of English subtitles -one that matches the English dub and one that is a direct translation of the Japanese, and both are in small, white unobtrusive font which is nice in that they don't clutter up the screen but is harder to read.  The special features are nothing special; usually just trailers for other anime or one-paragraph character profiles.  The main menu has no fancy video intro but it does have a really awesome rock-theme that plays in the background.  Still, it would have been nice to have different music for different menus, as YYH sports a varied and catchy arsenal of themes.

Another nitpick is the weird cutting off points for the seasons - the Dark Tournament Ark starts in box-set one and ends in box-set three, and considering the number of Dark Tournament Arc episodes on box-sets one and three it would have been easy to fit them on the dvd's for box-set two, or add one more thinpak. I would not have minded even a slimmer (and by extension cheaper) fourth and final box set (The Three Kings Arc is under twenty episodes) if it meant each box-set would truly only contain one season each.  This is a minor, organization complaint, though.  It only really becomes an annoyance if you were to go looking for a particular episode to re-watch and it turned out to not be in the box-set you expected because it was tacked on to the beginning of the box-set after or the ending of the box-set before.

In conclusion, it's a great value for the money simply due to the series size, and everything is done well, but it would have been nice to see the distributors go the extra mile and splurge on thicker packaging, consistency in the art and better special features. I'm satisfied with these four box sets but if a more complete single box set comes out I'll be the first to see these and buy that.  If you are already a fan of the series I recommend picking these up, but if you just want to test it out I'd recommend you find another way to watch a few episodes (funimation sometimes offers free streaming of their anime on their website) and see if you genuinely like it before you lay your cash down, as these won't have great resale value if it turns out it's not your thing.

A satisfactory job, but not an exceptional one.  3.5/5 stars, which for convenience I'll round up.

EDIT:  Also, be careful when putting the dvd's back in to secure them firmly; they tend to fall out of their places a lot easier than  other thinpaks I have had, my season 2 box-set in fact had one loose dvd  Not a deal-breaking, you just have to make sure they are secure instead of just throwing them in all willy nilly.",1284163200,11,3902,4.466197183098592
3505739,5,B001C4ZQEI,Ok. I had to change my rating. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love Yu Yu Hakusho. What I hate is getting ripped the [...] off. I ordered this set from AudreyAnimeStore thinking I was getting a good deal. Not even close. The discs are obviously bootleg. The picture quality is horrible and discs 3 and 4 don't even work. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY!,1277164800,2,380,4.366197183098592
3505740,4,B001C4ZQEI,"Season 2 is probably the best of the 4 seasons of Yu Yu Hakisho, in large part because of the compelling action and dialogue of the Dark Tournament.  The price for this 4 disc set is great, and it came as promised overnight for a about $12 more.  The video and audio are great (480p video).  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that it does not contain all of the second season episodes (at least according to Wikipedia), and it definitely does not contain all of the Dark Tournament episodes.  Those episodes are episodes 26 through 66.  This DVD set contains episodes 29 through 56.  The first 3 episodes of the Dark Tournament are included on the DVD covering the 1st season; the last 10 episodes are on the DVD covering the 3rd season.  So, if you want to see all of the Dark Tournament episodes, you need to buy DVDs covering seasons 1 through 3, which is not such a bad thing, and still worth the money.",1270166400,3,916,4.290697674418604

3505743,5,B001C4ZQEI,"I have always been a huge fan of Yu yu Hakusho. The episode quality is better than I was expecting.

My only buff with this season box set is that it DOESN'T have the entire season like the name suggests. It starts off in round 2 of the Dark Tournament and ends right after Kurama's fight in the finals (which was round 1). They should have made an extra disc so they could have actually covered the entire season rather than just the main chunk of it.",1264636800,,452,4.195402298850575
3505744,5,B001C4ZQEI,"This box set includes episodes 29-56, which is the start of the Dark Tournament and ends right before the finals of the Dark Tournament.  I found these episodes to be amazing, as it had a perfect mix of comedy and action.  These episodes aren't remastered and the only extras you get are trailers, textless song and character profiles.  I absolutely loved the packaging of these season sets.  As you can tell, each one has someone on them.  This one in particular has Kuwabara on it.  Inside the box(which is about the size of a DVD case, has two slim dvd cases, each with 2 dvd's in each.  I think it's been packaged very well.  Back to the episodes, they also have eng/jap subtitles and eng/jap audio for those who like to watch in japanese.  I would highly recommend these to any Yu Yu Hakusho lover or anyone who enjoys a good action anime.  Enjoy! :)",1261180800,,855,4.458064516129032
