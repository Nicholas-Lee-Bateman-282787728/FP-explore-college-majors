4829903,5,B005LRPUQG,Great. Had seen some of this on TV. Grandson Brady has been looking forward to these for some time! Now he has them,1366502400,,115,4.043478260869565
4829904,4,B005LRPUQG,My daughter is in love with this show. I am using all of the DVDs that I purchased on Amazon as a reward for good behavior!,1362355200,,123,3.769230769230769
4829905,5,B005LRPUQG,I bought this before a cross country road trip.  My daughters were entertained for HOURS!!  So thankful for this DVD!!,1359158400,,118,4.85
4829906,3,B005LRPUQG,The Little Einsteins have always been a favorite with my grandchildren.  The episodes are both educational as well as entertaining.,1356912000,,131,5.55
4829907,3,B005LRPUQG,"The child I babysat and lived with for awhile seemed to enjoy this, but I think he much prefers Blue's Clues and especially Saved by the Bell any day.  Yes, this is semi-educational, but it is VERY odd.  It is not something I would have purchased had I known.  It does touch on composers and artists, but there is also a ""mommy"" cello trying to find one of her lost cello children, etc.  And there is a skit on socks or something.  Very odd.",1356825600,,441,4.2023809523809526
4829908,5,B005LRPUQG,"This dvd does not appear to be sold through disney, there is no advertising material in the case like usual and the actual dvd is purple. If the packaging is not important to you then the dvd itself is great, all of the episodes are legit and play like a regular disney dvd. My daughter loves the show and all of the episodes on the disk are excellent!",1339200000,5,352,4.1911764705882355
4829909,3,B005LRPUQG,"The title of the 3 new DVD's made me think that there would be a lot more geography to these DVDs but there isn't.  When I first opened the DVD it looked fake. It is a plain wrapped disk.  It doesn't feel like a real Disney DVD.  I have studied the cover to compare to older Einsteins and I can see differences.  There are no advertisements on this DVD which is not like Disney.  The picture quality and sound quality are normal which is what should be making me happy and satisfied, but I just can't help to feel that these are not official Disney DVDs.  There are no bonuses.  I have not owned an Einstein that didn't have a bonus of some sort.  I bought the other 2, Africa and America.  Hopefully they are better but the back shows they have no bonuses either.  My child is 4 and doesn't seem to be as interested in this one.  My child can watch Einsteins over and over again.  I would say if your library has this set check it out instead of buying it.",1330732800,13,957,4.141304347826087
4829910,4,B005LRPUQG,"I was searching for the content as I don't want to buy duplicates.  The closest I could find to an episode summary was on Disney's site.

Here's what it has to say: --Next Stop. EUROPE! Pack your bags for laughter and adventure when you Go To Europe with the little Einsteins! Trek through Italy - the birthplace of string instruments - and discover what a cello has in common with a giraffe, a wooden bridge and a bowl of spaghetti! Sing a silly song to make the Mona Lisa smile while visiting the Louvre in Paris, France, and help the team outsmart a tricky dragon in Spain with music-powered magic. Discover excitement around every corner on this remarkable European adventure bursting with fun and surprises!--",1330041600,,714,4.704
4829911,4,B005LRPUQG,My kids love the Little Einsteins (one is 4 and one is 6).  I am amazed at the things they seem to pick up and retain from this show.,1325894400,,133,3.586206896551724
4829912,3,B005LRPUQG,"I bought this for my nephew who LOVES little Einsteins, and I was very diappointed to hear that the second cartoon out of three on this disc had no sound.",1325116800,2,154,4.166666666666667
8478427,1,B005LRPUQG,"I paid 15 dollars for this DVD and wanted so badly for it to work, however, the DVD looks like it was copied and will not work in our DVD player.  I am so disappointed with this purchase and demand a refund ( I will be more than happy to send your DVD back).  I am currently looking for another seller to purchase this same DVD because my daughter loves this animation show.",1523491200,,374,4.109589041095891
