8452131,3,B0050ZIACU,"I am a big fan of cooking videos and I feel like I often learn something or get some good ideas when watching them. That was the case here. Tom Small, the presenter on this disk, is head chef at what looks like a suburban Italian restaurant. He shows you how to make some very tasty Italian dishes at home. Nothing is complicated and the ingredients will all be found at your local supermarket. Inside the disk case there is a removable list of ingredients for all the recipes so that you can take it along to shop for them without having to first play the disk and write them down yourself.

As to what is included, there are a couple of choices for each of several courses in a full Italian meal. There are a couple of salads, clams in a white wine sauce, a couple of pastas, and a pizza with pesto and ricotta. There is also one recipe each for chicken, lamb, and shrimp dishes. There are two choices for desserts. That makes 12 dishes in all, plus a recipe for seasoned butter which is used to make the sauce in which the clams are cooked. You can watch the whole disk end to end in just under an hour and a quarter.

This is one disk in a series of four,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dare-To-Cook-Seasonal-Italian-Cuisine-4-Disc/dp/B008DKHOFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dare To Cook, Seasonal Italian Cuisine (4-Disc)</a>, and this one focuses on spring. That means lots of fresh tomatoes, garlic and fresh herbs in the recipes. I liked several things presented here. The pesto pizza was really good. The penne with pancetta, peas, and mascarpone was quick and easy. The lamb chops in garlic and rosemary were also easy and very tasty.

All that said, I can only give this disk three stars. At a bit over an hour and with only twelve recipes, there isn't really quite enough here to be a satisfying product all by itself. Since the full set is four seasons, it would have been better to either include more dishes in each season or to put two seasons on a disk in order to give enough content to justify the price. It would have been nice to have included printable recipes in addition to the videos. Still, since I was lucky enough to find this at my local library, I enjoyed watching it and I will certainly make some of the dishes presented. Despite the short list of recipes, everything presented was done very well.",1340928000,,2371,4.6810551558753
