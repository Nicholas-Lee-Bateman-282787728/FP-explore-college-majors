A rather tough one to watch too often. Was it worth it in the end? I still can't quite figure that one out just yet.",1262131200,,347,4.421875
8064861,2,B0009PLM6C,"The last time I visited this show in Volume 5, to me the series was starting to decline, especially in animation quality and character design. One of the faults of Chrono Crusade is that the demons never seem even vaguely frightening. They remind me of Oscar Wilde at his most foppish so it's kinda hard for me to understand why some characters find them frightening. A lot of the battle scenes are comical and any drama built up in the situation is destroyed by the overacting. Volume 6 is a continuation of this show's decline into mediocrity with smash em battles and hocus pocus religious jargon.

As the first episode opens, Rosette finally meets up with her brother Joshua after searching for years. But it's not quite a happy reunion. He doesn't even recognize her and is on the side of Aion. What can Rosette do as Aion uses the Apostles to perform another in a chain of hopelessly confusing ceremonies to accomplish something about breaking down the balance between Heaven and Hell. We are again subjected to cheap-looking aerial battles, at times showing up as simply distant moving sparks to save money. We also get a glimpse into Chrono's past, but it seems forced and rushed happening so close to the end of the series. If it had been done earlier, it could have commanded more emotional heft and been an interesting subplot. As soon as Chrono Crusade began to focus on the extended story arc of Aion's plot, this show began to fall apart. I would say watch it through the third volume and call it quits after that. I'm going to read the manga version next and see if it goes in another direction.

Features some extras like character information, opening/closings, Azmaria lessons which help with the background, but nothing especially noteworthy.",1128556800,3,1761,4.770491803278689
8064862,5,B0009PLM6C,"It finally came to be that the viewer was told what was truly happening and the action came right at the same time. This dvd gives what I personally was waiting for in this series. There are a few surprises here and there as well. Overall, i say this is the best other than the first of the six so far, much better than the last few. Can't wait for the last.",1120608000,6,358,3.986111111111111
