7932001,1,B000056CSG,Cannot watch this DVD as it is NOT in English or English subtitles as it claimed. So the movie is a loser.,1465862400,,106,3.8636363636363638
7932002,2,B000056CSG,"As a big fan of French movie stars, including J.-P. Belmondo I welcome any international release of their movies.

Unfortunately, as I tried to watch it on 2 different DVD players and 2 different computers, I couldn't find English soundtrack, although packaging clearly stated ""English Dolby Mono"".

I give it 2 stars as seller delivered on time and as promised.",1433894400,,362,5.016666666666667
7932003,3,B000056CSG,"Although StudioCanal's French DVD is marked as having a dubbed English-language soundtrack, unfortunately that's a misprint - the DVD only includes the original French soundtrack with no English subtitles. If you want an English-friendly version, track down the Australian or Spanish PAL DVDs, released as Hunter Will Get You.

""Everything I do, everything I touch is illegal."" With a line like that, you know you're not in for high art, but you still might need all your suspension of disbelief for Jean-Paul Belmondo's background in L'Alpagueur aka Hunter Will Get You. Not the part about him being hired by the police to take care of certain cases without the formalities and paid with money the cops have taken from drug dealers but haven't put in the evidence room - more the part about him being a thrill-seeking former big game hunter with his own private island who wanted to hunt humans for a change. Thankfully we don't see any evidence of his past and the hunting is more in the lines of undercover work than stalking his prey in the bush, but even so...

Once you get over the rather too colourful backstory it's a decent enough Saturday nighter, the kind of unambitious crowdpleasing 70s French thriller that led Jean-Luc Godard to dismiss Belmondo as a traitor to the revolution in one of his typical moments of hyperbole. Having taken care of a drugs ring and exposed a crooked cop (who conveniently blurts out ""Honest? Me? Don't insult me!"" for the benefit of a hidden tape recorder), he sets about tracking down Bruno Cremer's callous holdup man who picks up petty criminals to do his dirty work before killing them. Unfortunately his aim's a bit off with one, and Belmondo's sent to prison to befriend the boy and break him out of prison in the hope of getting some leads. Naturally things go wrong and they end up pursued by cops and gangsters alike, but while the film never really strays from the formulaic it delivers the goods better than most of Belmondo's later policiers and polars. Writer-director Philippe Labro does rather botch the opening, especially a moment where Belmondo knees a `pregnant' woman repeatedly in the stomach, but makes a better job of the rest of the film. Cremer's coldly efficient villain, announcing himself to a couple of unlucky gendarmes with ""It's a nasty business, gentlemen. There will be widows and orphans,"" is a big plus, though he's unfortunately absent from much of the middle of the film.

Unlike the French DVD, which erroneously states an English language option, the Spanish and Australian PAL Region 2 DVDs offer the choice of subtitled French or dubbed English and a decent widescreen transfers, though none of the extras from the French DVD have been carried over.",1284076800,4,2734,4.875268817204301
