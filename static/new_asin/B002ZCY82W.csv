4016040,5,B002ZCY82W,"Bill Paxton as the polygamist Mormon in this series has driven me absolutely crazy for four seasons.  I always want to reach inside of the television and start choking him for the crazy things he does.  This season he pushed my buttons even more.  He decides to run for political office, of all things, with the express idea of going public about being a polygamous Mormon at his victory speech with his multiple wives and children beside him. ""You idiot,"" I scream at my TV, ""how can you be so stupid?!"" But this is Paxton's brilliance.  He has completely caught someone who is in the continuous, rapt thrall of obsessive religious belief. He is humorless, which is true of all zealots, because he never steps outside of its thrall for even a second.  It absolutely controls every aspect of his life.  He laments his early beginnings as a lost boy, thrown out of his outlaw Mormon compound, and mistakenly believes he has recovered from all of that.  He has never recovered from being raised at a cult religious encampment.  What he's done is try to transplant the cult to new soil, mainstream USA life. He plays the character as rather one dimensional and robotic because someone who is in a state of rapturous religious zeal IS one dimensional!

The other characters revolve around him.  He is the head so what he says goes.  However, he has thrown three wives together, all of whom have his children.  They live and function as a unit. Like women everywhere who are cast into subordinate positions from which they can never emerge, they scheme around him. Oh boy, do they scheme. While he has his eye constantly on the prize, being united with heavenly father in paradise with this huge family, the wives jockey for position, power, and play all ends against the middle.  If they believe in the end destiny, that takes a very subordinate position to daily contention with the here and now.

Then there is the true horror: when you take on multiple spouses, you take on multiple in-laws.  Just imagine having to cope with multiple sets of in-laws instead of just one set.  One absolutely needs religious zeal to take on that component of this lifestyle.

4016443,5,B002ZCY82W,I think that the series as a whole is well written and presented with many of the issues present in the idea of polygyny.  The question then where does religious belief end and lust begins and its consequences.  The adding of a forth wife demonstrates that expectations makes such things difficult and the politics of being openly ploygamous complicates things even more.,1468454400,,371,4.967741935483871

I really wanted to see him kill her, for all the pain and sadness she caused others, she really needed to die. That's why I only gave it 4 stars !!",1444953600,,498,4.365591397849462

4016734,4,B002ZCY82W,"It was good until Season 4, Episode 5 (""Sins of the father"")... this is where Big Love ""Jumped the Shark"". Anyone familiar with the show Happy Days knows that ""Jumping the Shark"" means that they just went too far, to the point of  being unbelievable. This episode was just too full of assumptions, misunderstandings, coincidences, and unnecessary drama. There were 4-5 moments when various lead characters could have easily resolved a situation just by clarifying something they said or did, but instead, they would say something like ""not now"", or simply hang-up a phone call rather than answer an easy question. Of course, this then leads to more drama, and more unbelievable situations. ALL of the main characters were put into plots twists in this episode, and then put back together into situations that were just too ridiculous to believe. I have not checked, but this episode feels as though it was written by daytime soap opera executives.

To sum up, Season 04 Episode 05 introduced far too many unnecessary twists, cliffhangers, and gotcha moments to be taken seriously. It's too bad to... Big Love was pretty decent up until this episode. This was a perfect example of ""Jumping the Shark"", and I'm not sure if I will continue to watch the remaining episodes.",1444003200,2,1269,4.925233644859813

This is really a dirty series which tries to make light of the fact that Bill is a religious zealot objectifying women through his supposed ""care"" for his family.  If he cared he would never have done to Barb whathe did when she was dying of cancer-taking another lover.  There is no justifying polygymy. It is subjugation of women and the extremely manipulative tactics of HBO once again blind the sheepish American audience gullible enough to believe.

While I could not share my husband with another woman, I was a little jealous of the sister wives being able to share the things that make women so tired, such as child-rearing, cooking, cleaning.  Being able to share ups and downs of life, knowing you are not alone.  The series seemed to run amok with craziness and the sister wives heading down different paths, feeling dissatisfied with their roles in the marriage.

4017074,2,B002ZCY82W,"I loved the first three seasons. The subjects of control, morality, religion and relationships was set in an interesting setting with interesting characters. There has been some discussion about how the 4th and 5th season went so far off. Writers running out of subject matter or different plot twists ""jumping the shark.""

I feel that what made the last two seasons so bad was a hidden agenda. It became a statement that was not just anti-religious but a statement about how intolerant our culture is. Instead of an honest discussion about tolerance, the series became a hidden statement and lost it's ability to tell a story.",1422144000,,627,4.915094339622642

4017151,5,B002ZCY82W,"Very thought provoking.  If Mormons truly believe ""the principal"", polygamy, is God's will and this is their deeply held belief, then they should NOT give in to a government mandate that outlaws polygamy.  In today's world the idea that marriage means one man and one woman has been tossed aside.

4017195,1,B002ZCY82W,Well the series has reached the bottom of the barrel. Bill lost all contact with reality and the story line became a beldame of frantic effort to try to create something new. It would have been better if they had maintained Bill's character as it was in the beginning. I am guessing the writers ran out of ideas and decided to offer Bill on a platter. The concept of publically announcing his involvement with the illegal situation of polygamy from the platform of his new won office and exposing his wives and family to ridicule was simply too unbelievable to imagine. Season five will remain unwatched.,1411344000,,604,4.7075471698113205

I don't watch broadcast stuff, no cable or bills from Comcast or the others so I just see what I want and when I want and I buy the series one season at a time used at a good price on Amazon. Big Love is a superbly well written comic dramatic contemplation of the challenges of a bourgeois middle class polygamist in Salt Lake City who tries to bring his beliefs in the principle of plural marriage into the mainstream while being constantly challenged by off the chart insane fringe cults, one of which he grew up in, that live in rag tag compounds out in the country with their leaders continually spinning out into darker and darker psychopathy. The exploration of the rationale of plural marriage is described in amazingly detached detail while never shying away from the many pitfalls and the awkwardness of social ostracizing. The series is every bit as good as The Sopranos or Breaking Bad, it is an exploration of a culture alien to mainstream America with humor, compassion and a lot of drama.",1408665600,,1075,4.575129533678757

I enjoyed Seasons 1-3, although S3 started to get a little weird. Season 4 has gone off the rails. I knew I wasn't going to like it as soon as Bill started talking politics. State Senate? Please. Mayor or something, maybe. But Senator? Ughn.

This season it seems as though they've made the 3 wives caricatures of themselves. What's the term? Overwritten, maybe? There's a ""too-muchness"" or a sense of Are You Kidding Me? Up until now, the scenario was pretty believable, at least on the public, non-compound side. The compound shenanigans have always been fairly out there, but you can accept that as part of the deal.

It was interesting to watch the everyday workings of this unconventional family. But this season it's like everyone has taken Crazy Pills. One of my favorite characters was Don; I cannot believe he was asked to take the fall. Come to think of it, I have spent much of S4 saying those words: ""I cannot believe...""

Honestly, Bill turns into a d-bag; he's always been a little off (he'd almost have to be). I'm not saying that it makes the show unwatchable, but it was difficult watching a character whom I liked in the beginning turn into someone I love to hate. When you start muttering, ""A-hole,"" under your breath, you know a character has turned.

Sissy Spacek was a neat surprise in the series; she plays a baddie, but she's so good at it! Some of the best lines come from Chloe Sevigny as Nicki. ""You can't leave us here with Mrs. Petrovich!"" (or whatever Goran's last name was) and ""They were petting rats! RATS!"" She has some great lines.

I'm invested now, so I'll probably have to finish the series. I hope Season 5 improves, although I've read some spoilers, and I'm steeling myself to be disappointed in the wrap-up. I almost wish I'd stopped at Season 3, but in for a penny, in for a pound. This season only gets 3 stars.",1405641600,,2062,4.544474393530997

This is a different kind of story that had not been portrayed on network television and I had followed the series for the first three seasons on HBO. Due to a change in work schedules and lack of DVR, at the time, I was unable to finish watching it. I have my chance now! It is a purely fictional story, but pauses one to think about other cultures and how other people live their lives. Though the plot is soap opera like, it is a different type of soap with characters that one can identify with on some level. It gives one pause to think about a way of life that had never been openly revealed at the time of its broadcast. I look forward to seeing the conclusion of the story in season 5, though there will probably not be any real conclusion but more of a look of the issues facing a culture that we are just beginning to get to know and understand.",1401926400,,907,4.188571428571429

It's typical liberal hype. Religion is insulted and represented by the fruitiest religious types.
Homosexuality and perversion comes in pretty quickly.
The ruse is to melt jelly brains into the Liberal Agenda mold.
The Executive Producer is a man who is married to another man! Not surprising.
Blatant confusion. If you think that there's nothing strange about that, well, you probably voted for the Muslim president who is crapping down the throat of America.
And if that image is disturbing then you might not appreciate Big Love either.

There are a number of really heavy developments in this season, and a clear sense of trajectory building to the final episode.

I can rent the whole disk for 2.99, and you are charging me $1.99 per EPISODE. That's alot of money to watch a show, that is a few years old already. Amazon has several like that, and it's not right. Netflix is $1.99 for the whole disk, which contains seveal episodes. So if a series is charged like that, I try to find it on another ""channel"" on my Roku, or I will just rent the DVD. Amazon should at least be competative. Charging per epidsode is unacceptable, especially when its easy to go elsewhere.",1368403200,,608,4.25
4017426,5,B002ZCY82W,"I am so thankful I don't listen to people's opinions on TV shows or movies because I typically love what everybody else would refer to as a disappointment. This fourth season was by far my favorite season along with season 3. Just beautifully written & tugged at the heartstrings in many scenes, especially when Barb was urging Sarah to not sell her self short over her wedding arrangement. *Spoiler* The ending of season four was one of the most beautiful scenes in TV history for me. Barb (in red), Nicki (in white), Margene (in blue) being introduced by Bill when he wins state senate as his wives & the closing song Peter Gabriel's Heroes playing as the cold, jaded world walks out on them for their lifestyle. I highly recommend this season. I really could care less with who differs in opinion cause I'm pretty sure those are the people who cling to Emmy winning series that are entirely overrated. Not only is this season amazing like the other seasons, but it was the first to add the after thought from the producers giving their concept & gear for each episode. Will Scheffer & Mark V. Olson struck gold with never selling this series short. If only it did run another season, though, cause this is one show that I didn't think they outran for money's sake like Weeds for instance, which I loved till season 6.

4017436,4,B002ZCY82W,"HBO Series offer entertainment and a form of education on many levels.
While I agree that the fourth series approaches a level of fantasy and black humour more concentrated than the other series,is itself of interest because many of the themes reach their furthest possible development before the assumed denouement and self searching of the fifth series.
Firstly,from ancient times through the Niebelungiad and onwards through Greek tragedy to us via Shakespeare,we know that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Poor Bill!
And that vanity,idealism and greed will also contribute to Bill's self destruction.
We find the unusual[for an American series],general theme of the persecution of the minority by the majority and the attempt of the minority to establish its rights within a democratic system under which it cannot possibly prevail. An interesting idea.
So when HBO shows Alby determined to 'purify'Juniper Creek's religion,he merely sets out do do what many authoritarian political and  extreme religious figures have done in personal anguish and inhuman hatred of their fellow human beings. [Eg Stalin and Hitler].
Juniper Creek is any  religious idea corrupted by ambition, greed and madness. The directors have chosen the perfect fantasy.
Poligamy,after all is a valid concept for a paternalistic society which promotes the breeding of children as its prime activity.
It exists in The Old Testamnent and in various other countries of deep religious persuasion in Africa and The Middle East.
But HBO asks how can it exist in a 'modern',educated society?
 The three wives,continully lie to Bill and themselves to maintain their'ideals' and their lifetsyles[ Nicki is a compulsive liar]
What a mess!
Sarah leaves Utah and the fight over polygamy. An entirely logical step for her in the Fourth Series.
Bill should never have run for office. This is unrealistic,although his single minded'idealism' will come crashing down,I am sure.
HBO shows us that no idea or ideal survives people,organisations,history, governments,bureaucracies or commercialism or the other pressures of life[like women's rights].
The saddest part of Part Four is the revelation that the Casino has increased drug use and dealing in the reservation and that love has driven Alby into insanity.
Finally,the  black humour of Part Four did much to relieve the political and religious hysteria. I screamed with laughter at the 'Mexico' episode with the Greenes'. The revenge on JJ by Nicki's mother [and her punishment]was a great idea too.",1318032000,,2535,5.410126582278481
4017437,5,B002ZCY82W,"The fourth season is better than the previous three and I was literally pushing off all my housework and misc tasks just so I could stay in front of the DVD/TV and watch this entire season.  There are a lot of shocking twists and turns and I'm often left shaking my head after each episode.  One thing I really enjoyed about this season was the deeper look at the life of each of the characters, especially Alby who was painted in a real negative light for the past seasons.  I can't wait for the next season's show.",1316563200,,516,4.298969072164948

4017439,2,B002ZCY82W,"I am a big fan of ""Big Love"" (I'm in the UK) and now own all four seasons.  All the previous three series have been brilliant - from the jeopardy in each individual character's life, and the double-standards of their everyday existence (which have made it so enjoyable to relate to), to the progressive pace and excellent direction; the script has been enthrallingly written through three series so far.

Suddenly, with this Fourth Season, there has been a complete departure from the tone of the previous series, insofar as the characters have all suddenly become much more 'smiley' and pliable: basically, I think they've been forced to 'tone it down'!!  The direction is APPALLING, make no mistake, with such plodding interactions, and total departures from the normally excellent timing displayed by all the best actors/actresses.  The script - and scenarios - are in no way true to the original characters that have been revealed to us over three excellent series.

SUCH a disappointment!  And a disgraceful betrayal of fans of the series.

I note that they are trying to interject black comedy into the fourth series, with the emphasis on the word ""trying""!  Trying too hard...so it is spoiled, and you are aware that you are just their pawn as a viewer, rather than feeling any affability towards the previously-understood characters, or with their ongoing personal situations.  Without spoiling the plotline, just in episode one alone, suddenly strong characters become weak, surly characters pitiful, there's been a sudden introduction to all the characters, across the board, of heavy face foundation make-up!  The clothes are tight-fitting and colourful and bright whereas before the character looked run-down or plain.  One character has been made to look so foolish in the script and direction that you lose respect for what was previously a likeable characer.  One mother attacks her daughter in a way which previously would have been against her principles.  Characters are shot over several seconds smiling innanely at each other, without speaking, and others have their interactions slowed so much that you could practically go and make a cup of tea and come back and you wouldn't have missed anything!!  The list I could write about the Fourth Season's failures is ENDLESS.

I wish I could say it had improved in some way, but it hasn't.  The opening credits and change in accompanying music (the latter has changed throughout) signals that there is a new hand at work here, and it's not good.  The credits seem to go on for hours, with so many repetitive shots; even these have been downgraded from a previously excellent introductory theme to the expected plotline and interactions between the characters.

From fantastic beginnings, and a well-maintained pace and credibility, suddenly everyone has had an about-face and I feel actually sorry for the cast, having to act in a way which reverses the achievements - good or bad - of their characters prior to this series.  I wonder whether this is the end of ""Big Love"".  Sack the Director and the Writers, I say!!!",1308009600,11,3084,5.033464566929134

4017442,3,B002ZCY82W,"As others have said, the timing/pacing is off this time. Everything is crammed in & the characters bounce from one crisis to the next with zero time to deal with anything. Previously, a viewer could relate to some characters & hate others, but this time everyone has become shrill & annoying. Bill seems like a pompous, control-freak ass, And all 3 wives are in need of serious mood medication. Bruce Dern & Alvy should have been killed off long ago.
The senate campaign & coming out as polygamists plot seems incredibly far-fetched. And the addition of Sissy Spacek, is the addition of yet another unlikeable character.
The same thing happened in the 4th season of 6 Feet Under, where the show lost its footing, but the producers were able to save & end it well in the 5th season. Here's hoping Big Love writers take the criticism from fans & actors (Chloe Sevigny) seriously & wrap up the series in a more believable, thought-out manner.

I think the horse has been flogged enough and is on its last legs, like Bill making public his lifestyle. Series 5 will surely be a farce. The best thing about the series is the freshness of the opening sequence, although I miss the ""God Only Knows"" from the other series. Acting, production etc. are all up to scratch, but like all series they run out of steam. A better stab would be an off shoot show based on the daughter and her baggage or better still a few of the wives are killed off and Bill has to regroup with the faith. A bit like Dallas.

It all builds up to a stunning conclusion for this season which I won't reveal here.  Let's just say that polygamy is already complicated, but it can become even more so.

The actors do a great job of conveying the struggles and conflicts between and within the characters, as well as showing how deeply the members of this plural marriage care for one another in spite of everything.",1297123200,,716,4.578125

4017464,3,B002ZCY82W,"My wife and I watched Seasons 1 and 2 of the Big Love Series. It was interesting programing in that the story depicted an unknown world and put it into a believable and interesting framework. It was like looking through a little window into a situation we've read about but had no first-hand knowledge. The acting, scenes and directing were all rather good. So, we watched Season 3.  Well, the first two seasons were just an introduction to polygamy. Season 3 built on that introductory base and the situations and personal interactions became more complicated and somewhat more interesting. Season 4 seemed a natural.

In Season 4, the foursome becomes ever more unstable. One of the wives takes an outside job and becomes locally famous. Another wife takes an outside suitor. One of the grandparents gets involved in smuggling parrots from Mexico. The grandfather dies and is frozen. The husband runs for public office and ultimately outs himself as a polygamist. The husband also gets involved in an Indian gaming venture and all the related complications. And it goes on and on. The problem is the story gets to be more and more unbelievable as the program proceeds. Seasons 1 and 2 were believable and were much like a well-done, low-keyed documentary on polygamous life in Utah. Season 3 became a stretch of that situation and was filled with a host of side issues. Season 4 is such a big stretch that it defies credibility, and that's a problem. It's just pure unadulterated fiction, and not very good fiction at that. Don't get me wrong, it's a well done program and many people may love watching it. But, my initial attractions to Season 1 and 2 no longer apply and I have serious doubts that I would ever watch Series 5.

Wonderful to come home from school and have mom at home, a clean house and structure and order around you.  I remember what it was like in the 50'ies.

I will buy this season when it comes out, simply out of continuity, and I will continue to watch the last season because I'm emotionally attached to the characters and story, but my issue with the fourth season is one of plot development. In the previous seasons secrets and twists and clues build up, and get let out to create some really intense drama which is what gives the show its power. However, the fourth season had none of that. The problems were presented, and resolved soon thereafter. Most secrets were discovered in the same episode. There were no build-ups, and nothing left to the imagination. My guess is that the writers have really exhausted most of the problems and issues that could arise with this set of characters in the situation they're in, and there isn't much left to do.

4017473,2,B002ZCY82W,"We all know Big Love isn't real.  It's HBO's version of what would happen if we took a polygamous family who appear to the world as a middle class, all American family, then thrust them into suburbia and see how they handle their dirty little secret.  This formula worked for the first 3 seasons.  Indeed, we had to suspend belief at times but there were always straws of realism that we could cling to plus the fact that it had humor, great story lines and a lot of heart.  Kiss that goodbye in Season 4.

This time around the characters are put into the most untenable situations.  One of the central themes was Bill Hendrickson's decision to run for public office.  It made no sense considering what he and his family had to lose, and for me put the kibosh on what was once must see TV.  There was still plenty of material to work with, mostly dealing with their daily lives without having to resort to these ridiculous plots.  Big Love was always something I couldn't get enough of but this season was mostly viewed with glances to my watch to see how much longer I had to suffer through the drivel.

There were however, a few highlights (very few), particularly the development of a burgeoning homosexual romance for Alby Grant, the maturing of Margene, and Nikki's growing realization of her own abusive upbringing.

And the experiments performed in a clinic at the LDS compound without any sort of consent or knowledge are reminiscent somehow of Nazi Germany. The violent
murder and later mishandling of the body of the LDS leader Roman which FAILS to draw the attention of the FBI who are actively investigating the activities of the LDS at the time of the murder.  The list goes on and on.  While a few weird things may make things interesting too much weirdness takes away from the show rather than adding to it.  And this season definitely pushed past believable into crazy town.  That said I am definitely looking forward to seeing how things wrap up next season (season 5, the final season).  I have enjoyed watching the Hendrickson family grow and achieve and I am hoping for the best for them!

 Threats to the lives of family members,  inappropriate behavior,  petty jealousy, crime, and distrust continue to plague the Hendrickson family.  Bill has made the decision to run for political office in order to force polygamy to the forefront.  Both the casino and Bill's home improvement business are threatened by internal problems and several family members are threatened with death by the Green mafi",1508371200,,1961,4.7176470588235295

The first few seasons are great. The writing had me rooting for the family. The situations felt somewhat grounded in reality, and the show had heart.

Very little of season 4 feels the same, and I found it a bit tedious to watch. I kept hoping the next episode would turn things around, but it didn't.

I won't go into any spoilers, but there are just too many plot twists going on. Most of which felt really repetitive and uninteresting. There was too much jumping around, and many of the storylines felt forced into the episodes. Instead of adding real emotion, all the twists and turns left me feeling detached and I simply didn't buy into many of the character decisions. I also knew there was a very good chance that I only had to wait 10-15 minutes until the next 'big reveal' would simply reverse the last 'surprise' or send the show in a completely different direction.

Overall, I found little room to connect with the characters this season, and very limited reasons to think this is the same family I was rooting for during the first 2+ seasons. It didn't feel like character growth to me, it felt like the heart of the show had disappeared.

Very disappointing season. I hope things turn around in the next!",1501027200,2,1317,4.587234042553192
8384643,1,B002ZCY82W,"I must confess that I watched three and half seasons of this show, mostly out of morbid curiosity.  The characters seemed fairly well developed and complex at the outset that I was piqued - even amused sometimes (e.g., NIkki's mother counseling her to have more children rather than 'try to have a relationship with her husband'. I thought that was pricelessly hilarious counter-commentary) - despite the rather creepy premise and the frequent reference to our Heavenly Father and the Principle. Then, it appears that the writers ran out of material and started throwing in everything and the kitchen sink. I'd say this started near the end of the third season but definitely got worse in the fourth. Each episode grew increasingly bizarre, with too many contrived scenarios and illogical loose ends which were impossible to rationalize even as the behavior of really damaged people. So I have decided to forget my sunk cost and move on to something more interesting to watch. If you haven't started watching this yet, choose carefully.",1498521600,2,1036,5.058479532163743
