8359768,1,B002AL3UIQ,This piece of junk will not load or play and I have a state-of-the-art DVD player. I sent the first one back because it was defective and just sent the replacement back for the same reason. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!,1265155200,6,224,4.232558139534884
8359769,1,B002AL3UIQ,"I was excited to see a unique Luftwaffe DVD on Amazon and decided to purchase this product.  What a disappointment.  Firstly, Amazon claims this is NTSC compatible, which is incorrect, and will not play on many DVD players.  I then played the DVD on a computer, then the real disappointment began.  This appears to be an older documentary, possibly transferred from VHS.  Frankly, I have older VHS German Newsreel footage that would put this DVD to shame.  I saw no trace of 'Rare Film', as the majority of the footage is from German wartime newsreels, intercut with grainy scanned photos.  It would not surprise me if this was a VHS to DVD transfer by some guy living in his parent's basement.  Pass on this DVD set and checkout [...] and buy their German newsreels... you will see what quality this DVD should have been.  Additionally, search Amazon for their National Archive DVD's of wartime footage... superb quality.  There really is no excuse for the poor quality, with low-cost footage plentiful.  Sad.",1264636800,8,1010,4.847953216374269
