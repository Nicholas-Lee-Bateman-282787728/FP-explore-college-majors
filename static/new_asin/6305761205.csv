With good reason. This cartoon is nuts, but so damn funny! And the jokes get better with age, because now I actually understand them!",1456444800,,352,4.883333333333334
7894273,5,6305761205,"This cartoon is funny! I don't say this lightly; my usual fare includes Pink Panther, Tijuana Toads, Wil E Coyote etc. Everyone who has seen this has rated this cartoon. It's not just kid funny; it uses themes from adult sitcoms, theme tunes, voice impressions and so on to appeal to parents as well. I have found myself watching this with friends as well as with my children. The jokes and settings all predate A Bug's Life and all the other 3D films and comprehensively trashes them for entertainment value. In fact, forget all these top 100 cartoon programs - get this and know you have your hands on something special. Start your own cult - your followers will worship you for it!",1243123200,,684,4.569105691056911
7894274,5,6305761205,"i used to love this show on Saturday mornings, I got up just to see it

like when the two flies had an out-gross contest and ate the dung beetles' house and then puked up tidal waves of...puked dung...

so much fun, really tried to get away with a lot

it needs to be re-released, licensed, and gotten out and known

and yeah, it ended wayyy too soon",1161129600,2,350,4.102941176470588
7894275,5,6305761205,"I have all three volumes and loved it when it was on tv on Saturday morning. Being that they are bugs, the two flies have a bit of raunchy humor. It's no Simpsons but still fun to watch.",1099180800,2,186,3.9210526315789473
