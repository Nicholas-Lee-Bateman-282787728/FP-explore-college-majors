7480438,5,B016WU7GOO,"This show is purely for entertainment, loud bombs, and pure military action. I favor ""Stonebridge and Scott"". The show continues to be exciting but I just favors those two.

It was so prevalent that I actually dreaded those scenes.. And there was so much of it that you KNEW it was coming.. no pun intended. Stonebridge was BY FAR my favorite character.  At least he could keep his pants up. I'm sure the 'men' out there will disagree with me but so be it. If I'd wanted to watch a porn vid, that's what I would have bought!  Stonebridge was the saving grace..",1520726400,3,531,4.343434343434343

7480452,5,B016WU7GOO,"well done.  entertaining.  also, thoughtful, despite the crazy world in which it is set.

primary actors solid.  philip winchester and robson green, especially.

i found myself impressed with how they never, even for a minute, leave you waiting for something to happen.  i could watch this for as many seasons as they wanted to make...

makes you feel like one of the boys, too!",1514764800,,378,4.8125
7480453,3,B016WU7GOO,"3.0 because I like the actors.
Too much layering and complicating of plots...why would Mikey let his son come to Thailand and hang out with him to ID him as family? Too few members on the crew, even a bad guy tells them that they need more men. They get help, from strangers with a different agenda. Seat belt on, seat belt off, seat belt on. Security camera connected, not connect, where did the cable go? Disappeared. Opponents just fall over all the time. Tying prisoners' hands in FRONT of their torso. Not tying prisoners together. Running after a poorly tied prisoner, and ignoring the paper files on a desk...forget the uncooperative prisoner...who's running in the direction of fire, get the files and leave.  You cannot hold an AK-x rifle the same as an M4/AR rifle. The nook under the magazine well is not enough leverage to minimize muzzle rise. Oh about that, no kick or rise on any AK-x rifles.",1514764800,,907,4.633540372670807

7480463,2,B016WU7GOO,"Cinemax succeeded in taking a cheesy and vulgar series and reducing it to a pompous, poorly written and completely uninteresting production. I'm guessing this show couldn't last more than three seasons because the director was such a full on pud. At least in the first couple seasons there was some edge to it and a certain level of operational believability. Once that was removed in the last season, there was just nothing left but bad writing, worse directing and mediocre acting.",1511481600,,483,4.9753086419753085
7480464,5,B016WU7GOO,"Amazing two guys and the team that supports them.  They are special ops and they always seem to have everything they need or can make do with what is around.  They all have amazing recuperative powers, which at 68, I really admire.  I find it interesting that they find so much  energy for a very physical job and a lot of extracurricular activities with women they meet.  If you are a Prime member, the first three seasons are free.  I bought Season 4  to see how it ended.",1510704000,,474,4.318181818181818

7480468,5,B016WU7GOO,"The only negative thing I can say about this show is some of the shooting scenes are so over the top. It's like, really c'mon how are they not getting shot?!! Other than that, this show has everything. Edge of your seat, nail biting suspense, explosions, twist and turns, comedy, and if you like sex and nudity, there's no lack of that here. Me being a female I could have done without all the gratuitous sex scenes. At least they were quick though. In the fourth season the suspense was so intense I actually had to stop watching for a few mins. Not knowing what Scott and Stonebridge were about to walk into in a scary place like North Korea was so unnerving. Talk about excitement! If you like action and suspense you'd be a fool not to watch.",1509840000,4,746,4.374100719424461

7480505,5,B016WU7GOO,"I have only ever written one other review before, and that was a few years ago.  This show deserves the effort.

There are many shows I have enjoyed over the years because the characters and plot were intelligent and believable, but especially where honor fights whatever it takes to do the right thing (I read everything written by Alistair McLean and Helen MacInnis when I was young). But actually that is not all of it.  I enjoyed NCIS and NCIS LA because of the above, but also because most of the personalities are so excellent and play off each other so well.  I dodn't really like NCIS New Orleans.  They had honor, but something was missing.  It tried too hard to be quirky New Orleans or to be like the other  NCIS shows.  I don't know; maybe a few seasons will improve it.  The only reason I am writing this review is because these actors from strike back deserve every new follower they can get. Hopefully they get a percentage of whatever profits result as I read they do many of their own (incredible and horrifying) stunts. I just finished watching season 1-4 with Phillip Winchester and Sullivan Stapleton.  I am-- for the first time in my life-- getting ready to watch all seasons over again immediately to see what I missed the first time in the fast-paced nature of it.  It is that good.... My understanding is the show ended after Season 4 only when Sullivan Stapleton was so seriously injured in Thailand ( a filming location) that he was in a coma.  It is very violent, and a lot of people get shot in the head in front of you.  Nevertheless, if you like intelligent, yet funny shows about honor and courage and duty no matter what the cost, you will love it.  If you aren't sure if you would like it, just buy a couple of episodes.  I bet you stick with it.  If you like justified or board walk empire or ncis or anything about good fighting evil, you will like it.  Try an episode and report back.  I would love to hear what new buyers think.  I can tell you that if the either of the two main characters pop up anywhere, I will buy the show, no questions asked.  They were that good and honest and real.  As another example of my critiquing to convince you (or not) to watch Strike Back, I started watching Orphan Black for free on Prime.  Fantastic concept. Great characters, but it kind of devolved into a farce.  It lost its way.  It is a shame because the lead is a phenomenally talented actress.  I have never seen anything like that range, but even though season 4 was still free, I stopped watching because it turned into a farce.  That doesn't happen in Strike Back. It is excellent until the end.",1498003200,2,2629,4.402489626556017

I've watched all 4 seasons 3 times now and will probably watch it again.  I think there may be another season in the future, but I can't imagine it will be nearly as good without Philip and Sullivan.  I would LOVE to see those 2 guys come back and continue with this.  Philip Winchester would make a GREAT James Bond or Mission Impossible character...  I'm really surprised he hasn't been utilized in a really good action movie script.

7480536,5,B016WU7GOO,"Someone told me that there is a fifth season but I'm not so sure because of this season's ending. But from the first season (1-3 Prime Free) through the fourth ($14.99) it had been a joy to have watched! It's like Cinemax took all the best ideas and merged them into this series. So I'd like to thank regular cable for not having anything to watch, which forced me to look at Amazon (free) Prime shows to fill a couple hours of boring cable tv... This show is everything a guy could want in an action show! And it's not like any show produced by American's making it a fresh and new! And it's not like any BBC produced show either! But don't wait till you're bored with cable tv to watch this series, because once you start you won't want to stop..! Put it this way, if you thought 24 was a good series then don't watch this series before you watch the 24 series that is also Prime free, or you'll be bored out of your mind, as Strike Back 1-4 is exciting while 24 is blase'.",1487980800,2,975,4.164021164021164

7480551,5,B016WU7GOO,"Amazing program. Several cuts above nearly any other action show of it's type that I've seen. The acting, cinematography, soundtrack and locations are on movie quality. Gun play is very realistic. The actors are convincing and clearly trained for the roles. The weapons and vehicles they use are all geographically appropriate for wherever the scene is set. i.e.  you see older Land Cruisers in Africa, not 2015 black Chevy Tahoes like you would if this was a typical American action show. Attention to detail is top notch. The relationship between the characters makes them hard not to like. You really care what happens to them. This show has everything. Action, scenery, cars, guns, sex. All the right ingredients, but unlike most action shows, it's not written for people with a 5th grade education like Walker Texas Ranger. It's not highbrow, it will appeal to regular dopey action fans too, but it also stands up under the scrutiny of a picky, educated and well-travelled TV/movie buff who can't help but notice when somethings off. Just really really well done. All the seasons are great. It is a treat.",1485475200,3,1110,4.935828877005347

At first I was confused as to why Scott got laid every episode, then I found myself looking forward to basically a new hot chick every week. And I know he's on Blind Spot now, but it's not the same. That's shows way tuned down compared to Strike Back. This show was a real gem. Too bad it aired on HBO's sister station, Max, it could've and should've gotten a lot more attention. And at least two more seasons. Shame it's over. I'd really like to see these actors brought back for either a spin off, or just give us a couple more seasons of this one.

7480628,5,B016WU7GOO,"Hats off to the producers of Strike Back for putting together a first class team of characters into believable scenarios in today's current world affairs.

Hard Core non-stop action set in a ""Semi-Real"" environment of today's sad state of the real world and the non-stop terrorism that we are fighting against every day.

The only distraction from quality for me is what seems to be the need to insert gratuitous sex scenes that have no purpose into every single episode.
Other than that one detractor, thumbs up all the way.

AND FINALLY, A SERIES THAT ENDS ON A POSITIVE AND COMPLETE NOTE! Hats off to the production team!

First rate acting by all.

All in all, GREAT HARDCORE, HARD HITTING ACTION ENTERTAINMENT!",1474243200,8,715,4.827868852459017

There are women in positions that women couldn't actually do but they are smokin hot. It does bother me that we're shown a 110 pound woman dispatching 175 pound aggressors but I guess the show needed a bigger ensemble cast to pull off the missions.

If you have watched and enjoyed the first three seasons then I would still recommend watching it but I often found myself to be frustrated by characters decisions. Evidently the main focus is that family comes before world peace. I can't pretend to know what that decision is like and have no idea how most people would react, but EVERY time that choice was presented (and that is a good number of times) the characters invariably choose their family. I just felt like it wasn't realistic to guys that had been training and doing this their entire adult life to just say screw the world my family comes first.",1470009600,2,641,4.582608695652174

Past seasons were great but the writers of this season should give the money back and return to grade school. These action series should have a tread of believability attached. Im half way through and Im not even going to watch the balance of the series. The only good thing about this season is its the last. They must have figured that we would buy it on past performance so they didn't care. How about this story line. Two trained operators sneak into North Korea (cant speak the language) find their way (in an entirely closed country that they stand out in like a fire in a refinery) 40 clicks to a special steel processing plant after being exposed and losing communication with their base. They then proceed to blow the whole mill up while fighting off 600 North Korean soldiers. While this is happening one of their long lost sons that had show up after being abandoned years ago (had no business being anywhere near this story)  is allowed to wonder around unwatched in the zone the British special services is operating in. And golly gee what do you know he is snatched by the North Koreans (which have agents everywhere) and a recording off his voice broadcast in the woods gets a hardened delta force operator to fold up like a wet napkin, throw down his weapon and surrender to the North Koreans forces knowing he's about to get his balls boiled in oil. .

7480824,5,B016WU7GOO,Great,1457740800,,5,5.0
7480825,1,B016WU7GOO,"I happened to watch the first (Cinemax) season of Strike Back in the lead-up to the release of this DVD set, and I have to say, the latest season did not measure up well.  And from what I remember of the other seasons, things have been trending this way for a while now.  After this last effort, I'm glad they decided to put this show out of our misery.

The most significant difference between Season 1 and Season 4 is the storytelling (or lack thereof).  It seems like the writers had given up by this point, and resorted to coming up with the barest story that they could get away with.  The first season at least attempted to come up with logical reasons why only 2 to 4 soldiers (always the main characters) were sent on whatever mission was needed for that episode, but no longer.  Just about every situation in this season could have been resolved if they had another 6 soldiers with them to provide security or form a perimeter.  But then again, the extra analysts and soldiers in Section 20 (the British military intelligence group the show focuses on) are inexplicably gone by this season.  Section 20 is now down to 5 people, and gets even leaner as the season goes on.  Apparently two women on laptops can do the exact same job as the loads of support personnel shown in earlier seasons (not that the support people ever did anything of note, anyway, but at least they gave an atmosphere of sophistication to the group).

Also gone from this season?  The ability of any local security forces to be brought in to help the few main characters, the ability to warn anyone at all when the terrorists are about to do something terrorist-y, the need to liaise with ANYONE outside of their small group, and the remote possibility of the main characters ever losing.  By this season, numbers are totally meaningless.  Entire truckloads of heavily-armed soldiers can be beaten by 2 guys with pistols, who dash around through machine gun fire without using cover surprisingly effectively.  Even the climax of the final episode (SPOILER) where the good guys are trapped in a barn by squads of elite mercenaries, are low on ammo and are wounded, and just talked about how they can't POSSIBLY shoot their way out... they sit in one place and shoot their way out, as the elite mercenaries charge (in small, manageable groups) head-first towards the barn from a single direction.  Genius.

On top of the failure of any storytelling logic, the entire final episode is jarring.  It's like they wrapped up the plot for the series in 9 episodes, so they made something up last minute for the last episode.  What's going on?  Who knows.  Why did person X just betray them?  No idea.  What the heck does it have to do with anything else in the series?  Other than bringing back a couple characters... not much.

Finally... The UN General Assembly is not in Geneva.  No.  You're not even on the correct continent.  How do you screw that up?",1457654400,3,2930,4.6061776061776065
7480826,3,B016WU7GOO,"I have enjoyed the first three (or four depending on how you count) but this one was disappointing. I don't want to give out any spoilers but there were many things that just didn't make sense. There did not seem to be the same camaraderie as before and most of the scenes seemed forced, as if the actors were just going through motions. The action was not as intense as in the previous seasons and the ""raunchiness factor"" has been decreased significantly. I hate to see this entertaining action series leave on such a weak season. I don't blame this on the actors who are all excellent but on the writers. The story line was slow moving and corny at times with much of the plot lines contrived. I am glad I have all of the seasons on DVD so I can go back and watch the early stories again, the ones with the really bad guys, lots of shooting and fighting and the great ladies of the show who were a major factor in making this series successful.",1457568000,7,947,4.29608938547486

I am actually really sad that there will be no more new episodes, as my wife has even been bitten by the Strike Back bug (it's rare for her to like action or action drama).

The way the characters move and engage keeps me immersed. Many special forces representations tend to be more Hollywood than fieldwork and Strike Back... strikes... a nice balance :)",1449014400,7,565,4.584158415841584

I do like the team aspect, and it is what initially attracted me to this show. It is still present, but not as developed. Scott and Stonebridge are in the middle of the action, and other characters seem to fall away all around them. If you like two guys against all odds this is the series for you. Now there are some WTF moments, and the son, Finn, is a bit of an eye roller, but I enjoyed watching. Lots of action. Violence.",1448409600,,539,4.242718446601942

8737440,4,B016WU7GOO,"I didn't expect to like this series but found it gutsy, current with regard to current international unrest and Sully Stapleton is absolutely the man. (Ladies take note!) No punches pulled in any situation, worth your time to watch.",1535068800,,232,4.9743589743589745

8737442,5,B016WU7GOO,Enjoyable except cant see a purpose for random sex scenes in every show.  Adds zero to storyline other than to show he is a guy who treats women like objects and toys.,1533427200,,167,4.21875
8737443,2,B016WU7GOO,"Pretty poor.

Seriously... 2 guys break into North Korea to locate & destroy vanadium? Trump's negotiating for de-nuclearization would have a better chance of succeeding than that!

And the assault scenes? 40 bad guys with automatics, who know section 20 is coming, can't seem to stop 4 agents wearing the crappiest camouflage and none of them even wearing kevlar.",1532390400,,364,5.1525423728813555
