8657232,4,B00KB49LU0,"This film, bases on the then-current ""Confidential Magazine,"" (which made Hollywood nervous) is fairly daring for its epoch: abortion is even hinted at. Its plot: an aspiring entertainer (Van Johnson) with a criminal past is threatened with exposure by a scandal sheet unless he reveals ""dirt"" about a popular movie star he knew when young. The performances are good, Steve Cochran's especially so as a suave publisher with a grudge against the world who, seemingly, has no private life except that of caring for his disapproving mother (Marjorie Rambeau). Therein lies the film's weakness: her resort to violence near the film's end. It's simply out of character and too easy a plot device. Nonetheless, the mid-fifties (less conservative than popularly believed) are well represented by the personages and televisions of their day, and show that, despite the years, the public hasn't changed - it still wants celebrity sin (and skin).",1475107200,,936,5.246666666666667
8657233,5,B00KB49LU0,Slander was released in 1957. It stars Van Johnson as a television entertainer who is blackmailed for his criminal past. Steve Cochran plays a sleazy gossip magazine publisher. Marjorie Rambeau plays a great part as Cochran's mother. You will cry with this film. Fans of the cast will like this the most.,1475107200,,304,4.865384615384615
8657234,4,B00KB49LU0,"Good little film, with Van Johnson and young Richard Eyer as his young 9-yr-old (or so) son. Van Johnson refuses to be blackmailed by evil publisher of a slander mag (similar to the National Inquirer), who threatens to publish story about Van Johnson's past conviction and jail-time for robbery and assault (when he was 19 yrs old). Now that he is on the verge of stardom as a TV star on a kids show, this revelation will be devastating to his career.  (And remember, this is the early days of TV.)

The story line is as pertinent today as it was back in 1957. Nothing seems to have changed, except that the public is apparently much more tolerant of personal indiscretions nowadays. But, the gossip mags still do their thing today, just as they did back then.

It is interesting (for me) to see the typical household furnishings of 1957 in this film. Some of the things we see are hold-overs from the 1940s and, maybe even the late 1930s. We see an old ""flopper"" toaster -- even though pop-up toasters existed at this time. We see a wall sconce that looks to be typical of the 1930's. These items illustrate that there is always considerable overlap in time for appliances and lighting fixtures, cars, and other things. That is, the ""old"" does not suddenly disappear -- but, rather, it gradually fades away and is replaced by the ""newer"" items. The furnishings of any one date may include furnishings from 10-20 years past. I always find this interesting to see first-hand in these older films.",1475020800,,1495,4.633962264150943
