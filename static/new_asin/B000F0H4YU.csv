8116187,5,B000F0H4YU,"The information presented helps to identify students who may have Fatal Alcohol Syndrome so that teachers and foster parents know what they are dealing with.  Interestingly, we are sometimes confused by a high IQ score.  Or, we think a child's problems are behavioral when they are really symptoms of the brain damage caused by FAS.

There are many helpful tips for teachers that will help students with FAS be successful both academically and socially.  A better understanding of how these kids think also helps teachers appreciate their needs and gives us hope to better reach them.

It was nice to hear a young man with FAS talk about his difficulties in school--he had trouble when students sat behind him but could concentrate fine if he could see everyone.

A small panel of three teachers and an administrator discussed how they incorporate simple teaching techniques to make sure the FAS-affected kids can learn.  Short clips from their classrooms demonstrated the examples.  Two on the panel had FAS kids in their homes.",1154131200,4,1029,5.011764705882353

8116189,5,B000F0H4YU,"This is one of two video's in a series about children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This video is very useful to teachers of individuals with FAS/FASD that are also in need of some good practical information and education about the issues they face in the classroom. A group of teachers with experience in educating children with FAS/FASD share their hard learned lessons. This is also helpful resource for parents and caregivers, and educates them about the issues teachers face in the classroom. This video is given to the parents and caregivers of children with FAS/FASD that are evaluated by our clinic--and we encourage they share it with their child's teachers.
