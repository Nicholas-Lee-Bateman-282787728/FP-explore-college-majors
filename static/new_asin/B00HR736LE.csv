6199467,5,B00HR736LE,"It's a true story movie, filmed in FL.  I was lucky enough to view the filming and be in the movie, however, that scene was deleted from the movie, not sure why.  Annie and Drea did fun stuff in that scene.  Oh well... My son was lucky enough to be in the movie as an extra.  The FL boyfriend.. Yeah, a minute or 4 of fame.  Ha.  All actors were good.  I got to meet alot of them.  Most of the film was done in Miami area it looks like.  Some was filmed in Sarasota.  I liked the ending.  I would recommend it.
Stephen Moyer is a nice guy, ""Annie"" is lucky... Enjoy the movie, at least rent it.

6199483,4,B00HR736LE,"A Spanish movie about a single mom, Christina.  She had two school-kid girls, 15 and under 10.  In order to search for her dream life style with beaches, she and the girls relocated from Ohio to Florida.  Christina worked as a live-in maid in a villa.  This immediately solved her financial needs.
The villa owner did not stay at home.  One night, Christina and the older girl (MJ) saw from  the bedroom window a suspicious scene.  A truck driver was unloading tons of plastic-wrapped boxes into a garage.  The next day, Christina found out those boxes were drug containers.  She was later invited by her boss to help transport those drug in a private yacht. This situation was  getting complicated when MJ moonlighted in bars and parties.  After MJ was injured in an car accident, Christina was separately arrested for drug trafficking.  She got her sentence of 15 years in jail partly for not disclosing names of drug lords.  An unanimous attorney hired by a third party appealed her case cutting her jail term
to only one year.  Now what?  This whole family of three finally moved back to Ohio.",1482105600,,1097,4.7

6199485,4,B00HR736LE,"What Free Ride does remarkably well is show how drugs eventually take a toll on a family of three trying to look for a better way of living but actually find themselves in a worse predicament- MUCH worse.  Also worth noting is that this is based on a true story which makes it more hard hitting.

After the mother (Anna Paquin) gets physically abused in Ohio by her boyfriend or husband, she packs her bags and takes her two daughters to Florida to start over (Liana Liberato the oldest one and the star of the movie, and her younger sister Ava Acres).  At first Anna thinks she's doing a good thing removing her daughters and herself from a terrible environment, however pretty soon she gets involved with the wrong kind of people- shady people who remove mysterious black drug packages off boats and store them in the nearby barn.

Anna doesn't question any of this but likes the amount of money she makes, so she continues working the drug smuggling operation to support her daughters.  She even encourages her two daughters who are curious about the activity going on in the barn involving strange men who drop off deliveries in the middle of the night to never go near the barn, fearing if they do they'll discover the drugs which of course could lead to the two girls possibly experimenting with the drugs or worse, getting killed.  Interesting I don't think it's ever said what kind of drugs are in the packages, but I assume either cocaine or marijuana.

Later, when obstacles arise (such as rescuing a team of security guards who are stranded in a boat at night and cautiously bringing them aboard while hiding the drugs the best they can, and another instance the boat getting stuck in the sand and Anna and a couple other guys spending all night literally trying to push the boat free but morning coming and eventually having to just get rid of the drugs by tossing them in the water) this is when Anna realizes she may have made a HUGE mistake getting into this line of business.  I find it unusual that the security guards didn't notice the strange and quiet behavior of Anna and her drug smuggling friends.

There's also other characters that come into the picture including a guy everyone fears called the Bossman.  You don't wanna cross the boss, *especially* this boss!  For he will kill.  He's used subtly which I like, and only makes one or two appearances that I know of.  Then again I'm not entirely sure that was the Bossman in that one scene where Anna stumbles upon him on the boat.

What might seem like a boring Hallmark Channel-quality movie in the beginning with typical disagreements between Anna and her oldest daughter gradually gets more intense as the oldest daughter finds herself involved in heated arguments with her mother.  This is because Liana sees that her mom is changing.  Anna's not only bringing in drugs, but doing them as well.  This changes Anna's attitude and it reflects on the kids.  The scene where Liana sees her mom partying with friends and acting unusual is memorable because a parent should never act that way in front of their children.  It's interesting how the moment this happens the movie gets REALLY good.  You can tell the movie's going to eventually be good based on the vicious opening scene showing the mother getting attacked by her boyfriend, but it gets better.  The final 35 minutes or so is tremendous storytelling.

Also another character by the name of Drea De Matteo comes into the picture.  She's a friend of Anna's and often drops by.  She seems harmless and polite at first.  A caring friend.  However when Liana begs her mom to go to a concert with Drea, how can a mother turn down such enthusiasm?  She *should* have made Liana stay home, because let's just say Drea is absolutely no good whatsoever.  The things that Drea does at the concert while Liana's around is just wrong and sick, but it gets worse near the end.  Without spoiling what happens, I don't know what happens to Drea's character.  All I know is that Anna and Drea aren't very good at finding the right people to hang out with.

I also find it interesting that for a movie that takes place in the 70's, I didn't recognize a single song throughout the movie.  This is because it's not really 70's music playing- none of it is to my knowledge, and it's just music that *sounds*  like 70's rock.  I could tell by the clean production and smooth different style of vocal melodies that I wasn't hearing authentic 70's music.  Small complaint, but they should have actually used 70's music instead of music that poorly imitates it.

Overall Free Ride is an emotional journey that accurately shows how getting involved with drugs in any form can tear a family apart (not just from an addiction perspective, interesting enough).  Anna and Liana's relationship is the aspect most noteworthy here.  Bad parenting, typical teenage behavior and drugs all combined.  A recipe for disaster!",1453939200,,4924,4.681395348837209

6199492,4,B00HR736LE,"Anna Paquin is terrific. White trash Christina (Anna) is in an abusive relationship so she takes her two daughters and heads south to 1980's Miami. It's like watching Miami Vice from the smugglers perspective. Paquin makes us believe she only has her kids best interest at heart a'la Tony Soprano. She shows a real knack for the business but you know there's a train-wreck ahead somewhere. Anna is a far cry from Sookie, showing her naughty girl side and versatility as an actress.",1420329600,,481,4.807228915662651

I've seen her in other things and just couldn't take her. (X-Men, true Blood) But boy does she shine in this movie. Supposed to take place in the 80's or 90's, I think, she runs off to Florida with her 2 daughters in tow (the reason for a loss of a star is the usual horrid older teenage daughter). She gets involved in transporting pot and things spiral from there. Good story and it is a true story. Except for the petulant teenager....everyone did great, loved the little daughter too.",1413590400,,650,4.336065573770492

6199503,4,B00HR736LE,"""We should have never left Ohio."" Christina (Paquin) is a single mother looking to start a new and better life for her two daughters MJ (Liberato) and Shell. They move to Florida and meet up with Sandy who introduces Christina to the world of drug trafficking. What starts off as a way to make some quick money on the side for her kids soon spirals out of control and changes the lives of all involved. I will start by saying that this isn't an original idea but the fact that this one is based on a true story makes it seem fresh. The acting is very good in this and there are just enough different story lines going on to keep you interested and make the movie tense. The mom trying to avoid the law, the tension between the mom and the oldest daughter, and the love interest lines keep you watching and wondering what will happen next. We see Christina go from a great mom to an absentee mom fairly quickly and the same arc for MJ really made me like the movie more then I expected too. Overall, there really isn't much else to say about this, pretty cookie cutter and predictable but it is a true story so that fact alone makes it more interesting. I give it a B.",1392336000,4,1167,4.237668161434978

6199506,4,B00HR736LE,"The film opens in 1977 Ohio with Christie (Anna Paquin) playing a punching bag. In the next scene she grabs her two kids and they are off to Florida to live with her girlfriend Sandy (Drea de Matteo). The film initially builds sympathy for Christie as a battered mother. We then find out she meet Sandy as a dancer and now becomes a willing participant as a drug smuggler, attending parties, ignoring her kids, and all around setting a bad example, making us scratch our heads as to why we should feel empathy for such a person.

The film, is based on a true story, written and produced by the youngest daughter. The older moody daughter, MJ (Liana Liberato) looks like an Ann Paquin clone. The acting was top notch. The film message was to show that women will resort to a life of crime for their family when there are no other choices, i.e. government support programs, although we never see Christie try those options.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.

And yes, back then the only way you knew you enjoyed a concert to its limit was to wake up in a hospital with no memory of it or pleading the fifth. Thank you Jerry.",1390003200,7,1131,4.427884615384615

This film tracks the real-life journey of a  Mom and her two daughters in a day to day struggle with life and dealing pot to survive.

Anna Paquin still looks good.  Who knew that the girl who flew with geese was gonna grow up to be a hottie and a good actress?
I don't regret watching this and I liked it.  It's a suspenseful drama, but not a thriller.  I probably won't watch it a second time.
