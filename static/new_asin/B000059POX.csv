1409113,4,B000059POX,"First of all, in reference to another reviewers remarks...
If you are interested in owning the music video for ""Independent Women Part I,"" you can purchase the Charlie's Angels DVD. The full-length music video is one of the DVD's bonus features.
If you are interested in owning the music video for ""Survivor,"" you can purchase the Survivor DVD single.
Moving on to this music video... I am most disappointed by the group's complete and utter disrespect for their past. Despite the cover image, new recruit Michelle did not sing a single note on ANY of the songs included (even the two music videos of which she is seen in). Why, then, are we subjected to seeing her face on the DVD cover? Well, because it'll probably sell better that way. <sighing> Oh well.
The DVD is oh-kay, but seeing as how Destiny's Child don't really have many videos released, it can only go so far.
My only other comment is that (and I agree with the other reviewers) it was a poor decision to include the So So Def remix of ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" rather than the regularly rotated original version. In the end, though, it doesn't matter, as ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" is one of the weaker videos featured here.
The best cuts are ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" (with its ""rumors erupting at the hairdresser's"" motif) and ""Say My Name"" (a hot and colorful clip with great set design and slick but subtle choreography). The ladies' other hot cut ""Independent Women Part I"" is not included here, but as previously mentioned, you can get it on the Charlie's Angels DVD (which, while we're on the topic is a great DVD).
So, all in all, The Platinum's On The Wall is a decent (albeit too soon) video collection from the harmonious ladies of Destiny's Child.",993168000,12,1704,4.664451827242525
1409114,5,B000059POX,i think this song is madd hot. This girls are so great. They are smart cute and funny and have a good sence of humor.,992908800,,117,3.72
1409115,3,B000059POX,"First of all I have to complain about the interface on this DVD, its just plain weak.  The whole thing is just blurry and ruins the whole DVD for me.
My second complaint is that Jumpin Jumpin is a remix and a bad remix at that.  I like lil bow wow he's mad, but he does not sound good on the song at all.
My third complaint is why Survivor And Independent Woman Part 1 are not on the DVD.  I could understand Survivor cause there is a DVD single available but Independent Woman can't be bought on CD or DVD anywhere. Also where is Get On The Bus, I cant really remember this video that clearly so its even more annoying not to have it on the DVD.
Independent Woman from the Brits was a great live performance but it was on a single in high quality already so this just feels like a waste of time.  But then why was their not more live stuff on the DVD ? I think it would have been great if there was lots of live stuff and interviews.
The one thing I will say is that the seven videos that are here (oh yes there are only seven videos in total) they are all very high quality (unlike the interface of the DVD)
I have to say this DVD is not even for the most dedicated Destiny's Child fans and really seems to have been put out quick to capitalize from the release of their new album.
Great Group, Great Music, Great Videos, Really Bad DVD.",991267200,2,1339,4.041509433962264
1409116,4,B000059POX,"Although Destiny's Child has not been around long enough to have a lot of videos, the ones that they have so far are all very good.  The only thing keeping this DVD from getting a full five stars was that it should have included Independent Woman and maybe a few more extras (behind the scene footage, interviews, etc) to make up for the small amount of videos.  Even without these things the collection would have been awesome if the original version of Jumpin Jumpin had been included.  Lil Bow Wow, Da Bratt and Jay-Z really took alot out of the song and weren't needed at all....END",985564800,,586,4.509433962264151
1409117,3,B000059POX,"Well let me preface this by saying that i am in love with Destiny's Child. Ask anybody i work with. I listen to their album ""The Writing's On The Wall"" all the time. almost everyday. It is one of my favorites. But anyway when i found out this dvd was coming out i was sooo juiced because i could get all their videos. and more than that i was hoping they would have some extra's like live performances or interviews. but when i got the dvd and watched it. no such luck. It's just 6 videos...
1. No No No Part One (the slow one) 2. No No No Part Two (with wyclef) 3. Bills Bills Bills 4. Bug A Boo 5. Say My Name (say my name... if no one is around you say baby i love you if you ain't running game... MY FAVORITE SONG!!! PERIOD. DOT) 6. Jumpin Jumpin (so so def remix)
another reason i didn't like this dvd too much is cos they had other videos that they could have put on here as bonuses. they have ""With Me Part One"" which came out in 98 but wasn't that succesful. The same for ""Get On THe Bus"" from the Why Do Fools Fall In Love soundtrack. Also i remember that they had a remix video for ""Bug A Boo"" and i was sooo mad that they didn't include the original version of ""jumpin jumpin"" on here.
I have jennifer lopez's dvd and love it. Her dvd has like almost 10 videos on it total with remixes and live performances... AND it had an interview segment and all these other behind the scenes stuff. So does Whitney houston's dvd. It has LOADS of extra stuff, even tho they already have like 21 videos already. So i know whut dvd's are capable of. that is why i'm dissapointed that destiny's child pretty much cheated me out of my money.
but again i love them. and it's cool that i can see their videos anytime i want. Just wish there was more for my money!!",983836800,15,1757,4.066282420749279
7934068,2,B000059POX,Most of these performances are on there other dvds. No difference.so your getting a repeat of performances you already have.,1431216000,,124,5.25
7934069,5,B000059POX,"This DVD was a must have.  I use to watch the Destiny's Child videos on BET when I could catch them and now I just pop in my DVD and watch the Videos on my 114""x99"" remote control screen.  I feel like I'm in the videos.

GOD Bless!

7934070,3,B000059POX,"If I were simply rating the music:  top notch.  The girls look great, they sound great, and there's a good vibe in all their videos.  The track listing is basically a compilation of their hits, in chronological order, from the first two albums:  ""Destiny's Child"" and ""The Writing's on the Wall.""  Looking at the color and graphics between the tracks, this disc was obviously compiled to ride the wave of ""Writing's ..."" popularity and the album's four top hits.  The sound is great and the videos get more slick as the production value increases (along with Destiny's Child's success).  My favorite by far is ""Bug A Boo,"" which features lots of sidewalk shots along Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles.  If you're a DC fan, or a collector of R&B videos, read no further:  you'll enjoy this DVD.

My only criticism comes not from the music or videos, but from what's lacking on this DVD.  Maybe there just weren't enough hits to fill a video disc after only two albums, I understand that.  However, someone should have thought to add more material to round out the entertainment.  The six videos have a run-time of around 24 minutes . . . done.  No behind-the-scenes footage; no interviews with artists or musicians.  The lone DVD ""bonus"" consists of a short biography and a long rave list of all the records sold and awards won by the group.  No liner notes.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not dissing the girls.  I love them!  About the disc, I'll be an optimist:  it's half full.",1137369600,6,1470,4.602316602316602
7934071,4,B000059POX,Good collection of some of their best stuff.  It'd would have been nice if there was a wide screen version of this disc.,1120608000,,120,4.217391304347826
7934072,4,B000059POX,"And the same applies to Destiny's Child, which is why I enjoy this DVD so much.  I love seeing the four original members.  The videos are hot, with each girl adding her own unique charm to the overall product.  Everyone seems to love the ""Say My Name"" video, but I view it as a letdown from the earlier videos.  Luckett and Roberson brought sassiness to the group, and once they are no longer featured in the videos, the entertainment value suffers.",1068681600,4,449,4.506172839506172
7934073,3,B000059POX,"This DVD includes PCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.  It also contains 6 music videos in their entirety:  ""No, No, No Pt. 1 (which is a rarely seen video by them; the first time I saw it was when I bought this DVD),"" ""No, No, No pt. 2,"" ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" ""Bug a Boo,"" ""Say My Name,"" and ""Jumpin, Jumpin (remix w/ Lil Bow Wow, JD, and Da Brat).""  The cover is misleading because it only has Kelly, Beyonce,and Michelle on the cover; some people may think there are videos by the current Destiny's Child lineup on the DVD (such as Survivor and Independent Women).  The cover should also include Letoya and Latavia (they were in the first 4 videos) and Farrah (she was in the last 2).  I also think that they should have included the ""With Me"" video (it was the second single after No No No; it is a good video) and the original version of ""Jumpin Jumpin."" The biography wasn't that great, either.  It just consists of a list of the chart position and sells of their albums and singles, appearances, and a few awards.  But the most of the videos on here are great!",1033689600,4,1080,4.343283582089552
7934074,3,B000059POX,"When I discovered this DVD I was thrilled because I would finally be able to see all of the more notable Destiny's Child music videos. The girls (women) do look quite beautiful and I am first reminded of why I fell in love with this group to begin with -- but this DVD is simply not enough.
The first video on this disc is ""No, No, No Part 1"" - a rather gentle first glimpse of Destiny's Child but ultimately it is a visual bore (a brunette Beyonce - gasp). Granted this was before Destiny's Child became an international success so they weren't given the financial backing to create the ""epic"" video pieces we see today.
2. ""No, No, No, Part 2"" (featuring Wyclef Jean) - a great video and a much needed remix to an otherwise lukewarm single. The girls look fantastic and have more energy and sass.
3. ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" - a rather clever video that is filmed on the set of a beauty salon. This piece has enough costume changes to make any head spin. Bold and fun. There is also a rather strange cameo by famed drag queen Eva Destruction (a.k.a. Alexis Arquette).
4. ""Bug A Boo"" - another bubbly and fun video that created the now forgotten ""cowboy/cowgirl chic"" fashion fad. Kobe Bryant has a brief cameo in a locker room scene...yes a locker room scene. This is the last video to feature former members Latoya Luckett and LaTavia Robertson.
5. ""Say My Name"" - this is the video that moved Destiny's Child towards crossover success. ""Say My Name"" is an experiment in color with its rotating rooms and wandering furniture. This is also the first video to introduce newer members Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. A great song and impressive video...though I cringe at the sight of Beyonce's rather awkward looking braid(s) hair-don't.
6. ""Jumpin, Jumpin"" - at the time this was the perfect ""gettin' ready to party"" song. A lot of fans carry the opinion that this is one of their weaker videos but I like it -- just not the lame ""So So Def Remix"" that appears in this collection. But at least the girls look gorgeous (when they aren't being eclipsed by the rap performances). This is the second and final video to feature former member Farrah Franklin.
I give this DVD three stars (I so wanted to give it more) because the disc contains no true ""special features"". The interface is not impressive and the ""biography"" is absurd. If I wanted to read an ""article"" I would pick up many of the countless magazines which contain the same information (in half the time). There are no live performances (which are definitely out there) There are no interviews with any of the members and absolutely no information about the filming of the videos. I would have preferred the song/video for ""Independent Women Part 1"" to appear on this collection and not just on the ""Charlie's Angels"" DVD. Personally, I could have put together a better package with what I have recorded off of my own television.
I also feel that it would have been nice (polite) to include the three former members on the packaging but is there really any ""fair"" way to do such a thing. Afterall -- they are no longer members of this group for heated reasons.
Destiny's Child are Columbia Records greatest act and money maker. I will never understand why they didn't take the time to put together a more substantial offering with this DVD video collection (check out Whitney Houston's DVD -- now that is a true collection). I recommend this DVD to all Destiny's Child fans -- but don't expect anything more than just videos.",1013990400,16,3490,4.612540192926045
7934075,2,B000059POX,"Well seeing as I do like Destiny's child (Original first).. But this dvd/video was a waste of time and energy. Not to mention money. Everything that you see on it DVD/VHS.. if things you can record off the TV your darn self. lol. But if you like to see video from beginning to end maybe you'll like this... Oh yeah.. Ever notice that the ""platinums"" on the wall, on the video/dvd are all with the original members....I thought it was just me.",1012780800,3,442,4.402439024390244
7934076,2,B000059POX,"First, let me gripe: the packaging on this collection boasts that all the singles on this video collection are Number One hits. Not true. ""No, No, No"" was a No. 3 hit, and ""Bug-a-Boo"" barely checked into the Top 40. Despite this falsehood, ""Platinum's on the Wall"" is a good but not great DVD collection; the best of the bunch, hands down, is the hot video to ""Say My Name."" Otherwise, there are no extras on this DVD: no lyrics, no discography, no interview footage, nada. Diehards who just want the hits should purchase this, but everyone else should really avoid.",1008115200,,566,4.6138613861386135
7934077,4,B000059POX,"Destiny's Child's brilliant sophomore album, ""The Writing's On The Wall"" has sold over six million copies in the U.S. alone and yielded four Number One singles.
Destiny's Child were introduced to the world with their debut single ""No, No, No"" and soon after it's release, the single jumped to the top of the charts worldwide and went Plantinum making way for the group that would soon be crowned the Top Selling Female Group. Hit by hit, ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", ""Bug A Boo"", ""Say My Name"" and ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" all topped the singles charts and became the hottest jams in the clubs and the streets.
