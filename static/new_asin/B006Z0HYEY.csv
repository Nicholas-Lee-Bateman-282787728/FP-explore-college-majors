8506707,5,B006Z0HYEY,"Had mine for about two months and I love it! the scenes and music are excellent! Nice to have something that is so beautiful and peaceful to watch and listen to. Highly recommended. would like more. Some of the places shown I have been to in the northwest and Alaska. Nothing like the northwest. The music lifts your soul which we need with all that distracts us and stresses us out, this viedeo brings peace and repose which is so much needed! lifts us up to the Lord like few things do. Makes a great gift that keeps on giving and is a blessing to recieve and play a lot.",1452470400,,573,4.218181818181818
