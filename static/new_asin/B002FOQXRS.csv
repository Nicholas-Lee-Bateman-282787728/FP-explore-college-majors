3923833,5,B002FOQXRS,This is the funniset show ive ever seen .i recomend it to anyone who likes anime or to laugh. way better then the first season.,1285027200,,127,4.12
3923834,5,B002FOQXRS,"""School Rumble,"" both the manga and the anime, is probably my favorite modern series.  Something about its surreal, over-the-top comedy played totally straight just cracks me up every time.  I like a big ensemble cast, and ""School Rumble"" is a series with no losers.  An episode can center on any character and I am as happy as can be.

This second DVD set continues pretty much right were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-one/dp/B001AEF67C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season one</a>&nbsp;left off.  The anime series pretty much follows the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/manga/dp/1435271106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">manga</a>&nbsp;as well, with the infamous after-hours battle to decide what class 2-C will do for the School Festival.  This action-packed storyline was one of my favorites in the manga, and comes off even better in the anime.  Things are heating up on the romance side as well as rumors of Harima and Yakumo being a couple continue to spread, something which isn't helped at all by Yakumo's sister Tenma (the object of Harima's affection) being in full support of the match.  Ah, poor Harima's heart is breaking!  After the hijinks of the school festival, there is a camping trip, a girl's basketball team, an ocean voyage and Karasuma's secret revealed!

The second season maintains the tone and craziness that we have come to expect from ""School Rumble.""  I love the fact that this series is neither a straight-forward romance, nor a comedy, nor an action/adventure.  It is almost like the series gets to reinvent itself with every episode, being exactly what the story dictates at any given time.  Things like entering a ""Hyper Super-Size Magma Curry, Cosmos-Size"" eating contest slide in easily next to tender moments between characters and the tangled, twisted web of love that gives the series momentum and continuity.

The only negative I can possibly think of about this second series is that I'm not a big fan of the new theme song.  Season one's theme was catchy and stuck in my head long after the episode was over, but Season Two's theme song just doesn't have that same punch.  Funimation's packaging of this season is the same as Season One, with the nice slimcase disks that don't take up so much room on your shelf.  I love those.

The real bad news is that this is it for animated ""School Rumble.""  While the manga continues, there are only Season One and Season Two for the anime, along with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extra-Class-OVA/dp/B0016KV7WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extra Class OVA</a>&nbsp;that was produced mainly for the fans.  Funimation offers both seasons and the OVA in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/School-Rumble-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002R0LRJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">School Rumble: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;as well, which is a nice set if you are already a confirmed fan of the series.",1259020800,9,3043,5.904109589041096
3923835,4,B002FOQXRS,"I'm always reluctant to review properties like School Rumble mainly because anime comedy really isn't my bag.  Chalk it up to my natural tendency to be miserable, but it really takes some spectacular animated effort to get me to laugh.  As such my scores are usually lower than the fan boys (and girls) would like.  However, don't let my crabbiness get you down.  If you happen to appreciate the School Rumble franchise, the 2nd Semester will surely delight.  But before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's take a look at the cold hard facts, shall we?

Funimation has recently decided to re-release the Region 1 sets of the show to the North American market. This, the 2nd Semester set coming in at a total runtime of 610 minutes, spans 4 discs and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.  All 26 episodes are contained in this, the Complete Collection.

The show wears a fairly conservative TV MA rating (oddly enough, up from the TV PG rating it had in the last release), which more than compensates for the over-the-top (clothed) fan service, and slapstick.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track or an English dub (either in stereo) and English subtitles available under either language choice.

Extras include an interview with the show's creator, interview with the Japanese voice actress who played Tenma, textless songs and a host of Funimation trailers.

Boy it's tough to accurately present the story here.  I guess the best way to describe it for someone who has no prior experience with the show is to imagine a blend of comedy and drama, set in the high school scenario, with a few teenage kids making up the main cast.  More specifically, summer, fall, and winter pass by as Tsukamoto Tenma continues to try and win the heart of her potential boy-toy Karasuma Ooji. Harima Kenji meanwhile tries to confess his own love for Tenma who, as we just established, has eyes only for Ooji.  Yakumo and Eri are busy working on establishing a relationship with a guy of their own.

Equally difficult is setting up the tone of the show.  The pacing is a bit, um erratic, as in some episodes are devoted almost completely to the cause of comedic relief (with little overall plot advancement) while others take a turn for the dramatic.  Now this is a widely acknowledged flaw in the first set that has been toned down slightly for this one.  While it still could hardly be called ""linear"", the themes don't swing quite so wildly here (episode six is the cutoff point between two major arcs).

The show stars off aggressively as in with more romantic twists and turns that most series can hope to accomplish in their entirety.  The humor, which actually comes in many shapes and sizes here (from all out spoof sequences to good old fashioned slap stick) serves as the motivator while established characters such as Harima, Eri and Hanai keep things interesting in the Cultural Festival episodes.  The pacing here is fast and furious and the show maintains a very energetic rhythm despite the fact that nothing significant is ever really happening.

The voice tracks on this one come with the usual hesitancy associated with determining which is superior.  The English dub holds up really well with most of the jokes retained and equally charming but I fear the nod actually goes to the Japanese dialog track here for its bubbly emotion and slightly more effortless delivery.

The in-show soundtrack, like the fist season of the show, remains poppy, upbeat with just enough goofy charm to integrate with the bright visuals flawlessly.

In all it's difficult to argue with the fact that this show is a whole lot of fun as indicated by the first paragraph of the summary on the back of the box: We still have no idea what's really going on with this show, beyond the fact that the weirdness is really piling up.

Fans of the first season will likely become a bit frustrated with the fact that the love triangle with Harima goes on quite unresolved here as well.  In fact almost nothing in the way of character story threads gets resolved until the final two episodes.

School Rumble 2nd Semester is a lot like the first season in that it's a pretty enjoyable anime property with a few rough spots scattered about (obvious filler, overacted drama, Tenma's aggravating antics, etc.) but at the end of the day, it comes together well.  So maybe I'm still a bit too grumpy to fully clinch the School Rumble approach, I can confess that there are definitely laughs to be had here.",1252454400,5,4557,4.725663716814159

School Rumble is a slice of life comedy, full of off-beat romance, random off the wall situations and slap stick.

3923904,4,B002FOQXRS,"Ok - There was at least 4 unnecessary episode added in that was not original and it beame nothing but waste in my opinion. I would also thrown out episode of Hanai ended up in distant island because that part of really not funny or it goes off outside of story.

They should of replaced these episode with

- They ended the season 2, when they were picking class representive for field trip to England. The fact that Harima and Eri became class representive of field trip it just became another twist to story and thier love/hate relationship goes even deeper.

- The Valentine day incident. Harima is stalking Tenma make sure Karasuma doesn't get involved, neither Yakumo and Eri has guts to give chocolate to Harima, and Tenma and Mikoto is stalking Akira to find out who is she going to give chocolate.

- Street fight of Harima VS Mad Max at Uzumasa street of Kyoto during field trip and everything else which happend before that during the field trip. I would love to animated version of Flying Heel Kick of Harima pulled off which became the near finishing blow to Max.

If they had to end season 2 right about here, I would of ended it at the raining of Yasui-Konbera-Gou.

Thats the scene where Harima put his seal back on which had Harima and Tenma's name. After while rain came down and rain pulled Harima's seal off from the wall, and in addition the ink spilled into the seal on the back which turned Eri's seal. Eri seal had her name one side, but she left her partner's side blank (she claimed she was confused still) and Harima's name spilled into the blank side because of the rain. And Eri came later that night and saw her seal changed and she was stunned.... it was one of my ""what just happend moment?!"" and I believed this moment was high-light of entire school rumble series and I wish they would of kept going until here...

If season 3 did really happen this would of been great placed to start.",1376697600,2,1919,4.45014245014245
3923905,5,B002FOQXRS,I love this series. I wished it was longer than just two box sets. The first semester to me was the better of the two. This is still worth your money though. I don't know what it is but this is one of my new favorite Animes to watch:) All of the characters have heart and you want to know more and more about them. For anyone who wants something new and fresh and hysterical i think you should get the SAVE edition :),1367452800,,417,3.9761904761904763

3923908,4,B002FOQXRS,"I would give this five stars, but I feel it isn't quite perfect. It is much better than School Rumble the first semester. This one takes off in crazy directions that reach past left field. I had a lot of laughs. For the most part all the love triangles are one sided, no two people like eachother. Lots of misunderstandings that lead to crazy events, lots of emotional uproars that lead to new discoveries and enlightenment that will make you laugh and cry. You will find yourself inlove with the characters and discover yourself playing match maker, who belongs with who, and why she should be with him. It is crazy that the Rumble draws you in. I promise, you will enjoy this one especially if you liked the first.",1359504000,,716,4.515384615384615

The character development was poor, the love triangles only seemed to worsen, and the entire plot of this volume seemed to be based on ""how can we drag this longer without actually adding any value to the plot.""

3923912,5,B002FOQXRS,"2nd semester picks up where the 1st left off. All the old characters are back and better than ever. The laughs are just as frequent and the fun never stops. I think my favorite thing about 2nd semester is the relationship between Harima and Yakumo. She develops feelings for him that are pretty obvious, but he's so into Temna that he never realizes. I actually found myself wanting him to forget about Tenma and be with Yakumo instead. The relationship between Tanma and Karusama never goes anywhere and Karusama actually plays a pretty small role in this season. Good thing, since he's a major bore.

I love this anime and I think it's the best school love comedy ever. My only beef with it is that it's unfinished. I have heard a lot of rumors about a 3rd season being started and scrapped, but they are just rumors. Anyway you really need this anime. It's a freakin legend.",1350518400,,877,4.550632911392405

Though at the end end it seems like their should be more. They never made the third semester. if you want to see the whole third season you will have to read the manga. though there is an ova that has not been licensed for american release yet. its just the last two episodes of what would have been the thirs semester. the last 6 manga volumes for it( about 2/3 of the third semester) haven't been released in english yet. so you will have to read them online( they have been translated by other people, some translation are better than others)

thoug,h as for this season, you will love it. situations just get deeper, eri seems to awemost get jealous in some episodes, yakuma starts to like someone, and tenma isn't any smarter than the first season. so there is a whole lot of comedy like the first season. this season does get deeper than the first and you will get hooked on it. second semester is a must have for school rumble fnas

3923916,5,B002FOQXRS,"What can I say about this great series?  The first 'semester' is required viewing; otherwise you won't really grasp the whole love... octagon? (way more crazy than a triangle!)

So this season continues the antics but definitely ratchets it up a notch. Through very humorous 'satire' episodes, the show makes fun of many movies, other anime series, and general Japanese life and culture.  The humor is appropriate for most ages, perhaps younger viewers should understand animated blood and violence for some of the episodes (like the one where they make fun of action films and action anime and have a gun-brawl in the school ~ it's all staged of course... otherwise every single character would be dead in the third episode!).

Romance and young love are central to the story and part of the humor.  It seems that everyone is misunderstanding everyone else's feelings.  Character A likes B but B thinks A likes C and D actually does like A but A doesn't know and then D thinks A is really into E... it is pretty wild and funny stuff though!
