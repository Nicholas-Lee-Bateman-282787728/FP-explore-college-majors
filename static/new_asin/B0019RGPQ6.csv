8275107,1,B0019RGPQ6,"The movie centers around rival drug dealers without much of a plot. There is some first person narration. The middle men sell to rival gangs. The opening credits show heroin preparation and poppies while the film centers on cocaine. The neighborhood in which they live is a nicely kept older suburban type.

The film attempts to create a mystery as to who is the top dog supplier (we see him in shadows and know he is an older white male). The lack of characters in the film makes it easy to guess as well as the other mystery relationship. The acting was bad which included too many pauses and bad dialouge. You would do better watching a 50 Cent movie.

F-bomb, N-word, brief sex, brief nudity.",1329523200,,696,4.515873015873016
