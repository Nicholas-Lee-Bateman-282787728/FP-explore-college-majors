8253287,3,B0013XZ6P2,"I'll review this in English since this is Amazon, but note that the films are not subtitled.
Flor Silvestre es a true classic of Mexican Cinema, and Subida Al Cielo is a classic if seldom seen film of Bunuel.  So there is not much to say about the films themselves.  Any fan of Mexcian Cinema will want these films.
The print and transfer quality s always an issue with Mexican films becuase the black market in DVDs makes it impossible for anyone to make a profit reissuing quality DVDs.  I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer and print quality with these films.  The quality wan't good, but it wasn't bad, and it wasn't distracting.  The sound quality was generally ok as well.
Finally, the Spanish spoken in both of these films is more or less formal, and clearly spoken, so these are definitely films easily enjoyed by non-native Spanis speakers.",1235865600,11,855,4.673333333333333
