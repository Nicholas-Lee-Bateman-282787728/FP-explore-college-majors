3507076,5,B000CCRMNE,"When I rented this when it was released, I thought it was a cute but semi-idiotic example of a ""dog movie"" where the animal is made to do things from a human's persepctive that they would never, like drink beer, and with exaggerated behaviours, like flying drool, etc.

Then, years later, I adopted a Dogue de Bordeaux and realized Turner and hooch is a documentary! Mine did drink (non-alcoholic) beer, the flying drool is affectionately known as ""slingers"" in Dogue parlance, and while not intentionally destructive or aggressive, the facial expressions and general sloppiness exhibited by Hooch is very typical of the breed.

I love the movie more than I can say.",1480204800,,666,4.9375

3507096,4,B000CCRMNE,"We had a ""wet mouthed"" Great Dane.  I totally understand.  Every once in a while (or more often), he would think of a T-Bone steak and, oh boy ...  He'd fling his head and the jowl juice would hit the ceiling.  And he thought about steak a LOT!  We loved him.  When he passed, we tried to replace him with another Great Dane.  Equally lovable.  But a ""dry mouth"".

I can understand the development of a relationship with a pooch.  No matter what brand.

Had never seen this movie.  Entertaining.  Worth the $3.  Probably wouldn't watch it again.

Generally never cared for Tom Hanks.  I enjoyed him in this and Apollo 13.

3507166,5,B000CCRMNE,"Before Tom Hanks was Hollywood royalty, he costarred with a drooling, though loveable canine named Hooch to solve a murder. As far as cinematic quality goes, the movie is something of a dog (no pun intended), but then again, it wasn't intended to speak to broad themes of the human condition. It was designed to be fairly light-hearted fun as this neat freak bonds with this slob sort of like human and canine version of the Odd Couple or something.

While it takes a brief turn towards the serious, they even back out of that fairly quickly because no one apparently wants to laugh for ninety minutes, only to be brought to tears in the final two minutes. How you feel about this movie probably is dependent on whether you can accept the movie and suspend disbelief and go with some of the more extreme situations, if you cant do that, this movie isn't for you.",1451433600,,862,4.5256410256410255

My son loves all the old movies and TV shows I grew up with in the 80s and 90s. He also thinks most of them are hilariously funny.

For the rest of us, it is an amusing film with just a few of the kind of sickening scenes that should have gone out with Shirley Temple (and hordes of other child actors) and young Mickey Rooney. I suppose, though, it is only that I don't usually watch that kind of movie that I cannot think of more contemporary examples. Needless to say, Tom Hanks carries the picture along with about the ugliest mutt one is likely to find in any film. Naturally, that is why that particular dog co-starred with the then (1989) still up and coming star. Happily, nothing has aged about the film (although, of course, Hanks has risen to the top ranks. It should still provide entertaining viewing and a few laughs for most viewers.",1416528000,,758,4.5

3507350,3,B000CCRMNE,Pleasant but slow moving movie about a scary big dog and an OCD detective. I liked those parts. Lots of slobbering and action shots of a big kinda ugly dog. Making the life of a fastidious person hell. (as we know dogs do) Plot holds together so so and the love interest with a vet is short.,1406160000,,291,4.12280701754386
3507351,4,B000CCRMNE,"Tom Hanks is an obsessive-compulsive cop who takes in a filthy, slobbish French Mastiff when it's the only witness to a murder. Basically The Odd Couple with a dog. It's predictable and formulaic to the bone, but hits a strange nerve that allows us to overlook its shortcomings and appreciate the sweetness of the ride. Hanks is largely to thank for that, at the top of his game very early in his dramatic career. Though a few not-so-surprising supporting actors pop in from time to time, (Reginald VelJohnson as a policeman? What a shock!) it's almost entirely a one-man show that sails beyond expectations on the merits of his lone performance. In fact, the closest competition is Beasley the dog, who's absurdly emotive and personable throughout the film. He and Hanks make for a great team, as silly as that might sound, and it's easy to tell that a lot of their best scenes were ad-libs that miraculously avoided the cutting room floor. Funny, bittersweet movie magic that really has no business being as entertaining as it is.",1406160000,,1032,4.803370786516854

3507398,5,B000CCRMNE,"""Turner & Hooch"" is a comedy drama crime genre film, which stars Tom Hanks as policeman Scott Turner and Beasley the Dog as Hooch.

The narrative quickly highlights Turner as a compulsive neat freak and perfectionist, who is about to transfer for a job promotion in Sacramento, as he guides his replacement David Sutton (Reginald VelJohnson) through his precinct police processes. But the murder of local eccentric Amos Reed causes Turner to provide a temporary home for Reed's dog Hooch.

Hooch at first makes a complete mess of Turner's spotless home and the two becoming familiar with each other provides many memorable scenes.

As the movie progresses Hooch proves to be a big help to Turner and Sutton in uncovering facts of Reed's murder, and finding a bigger trail of organised crime.

The combination of Turner, Hooch and Sutton presents three great personalities, and their fun natures are highly entertaining. There are some bad guys who commit crimes, but the film is nevertheless mostly fun and comfortable viewing.

3507436,5,B000CCRMNE,"""Turner & Hooch"", the summer 1989 blockbuster starring Tom Hanks, contains many funny moments from beginning to end. Hanks plays Turner, a police detective who is assigned to housesit a bulldog named Hooch after his owner dies. Turner has quite an adventure with his new pooch partner, who aimlessly tears up Turner's apartment upside-down. He even goes one step further by chewing the upholstery in Turner's car! Turner is at his wit's end - so much so that he wants to put Hooch out of his misery! When a verterinarian (Mare Winningham) sees how Turner is treating the animal, she is tempted to report Turner to the SPCA. Craig T. Nelson also stars as Turner's turncoat boss. Reginald VelJohnson stars as Turner's right-hand man, or associate detective. Through it all, Turner & Hooch manage to work things out - albeit roughly, still they manage to bring corrupt evildoers to justice. This movie does have a happy ending, I'm glad to say. You'll be glad to add ""Turner & Hooch"" to your must-have DVD collection real soon, so order it today!",1371513600,,1043,4.8

That's because I probably saw it on Disney or something like that, and the cussing was taken out.  There is quite a bit of cussing in this movie, as well as a couple unnecessary scenes when he is walking around in his whitey-tighties, which some might find a bit awkward when showing to the family.

Hooch is the primary witness in his previous owner's murder. Hooch is also a menace to an orderly home due to his rambunctious behavior and sheer brawn. Scott Turner is a small-town police detective who is set on solving the murder. Turner is also a compulsive neat freak (almost a predecessor for MONK).

3507535,5,B000CCRMNE,"This movie is a classic. There are many funny parts when hooch tears everything apart in tom hanks neat clean home. But sometimes i think i prefer k-9 not that k9 is better, both are great dog comedies, but the dog in k-9 with jim belushi lives at the end. To me, i find the ending to turner and hooch to be devastatingly sad, even though there was a brilliant attempt to make it less sad, and not completely ruined, the scene that was put in at the end when the puppy looked like hooch when we didn't know that camile and hooch mated till that point. But still, it's awful when it shows the dog being shot in the air, it's a little graphic, and to back that up, this film was on tv the other day on tnt, and they had to cut that part out, when it shows the bloody spot on his fur when he is shot. It's a bit much, there is enough violence in movies. I'm fine with people getting killed in films because it is fake, and the animals also getting killed is fake, but still too unbearable for me, and animal lovers. Not that the ending ruined the film, because i can still enjoy the film, and laugh at the parts that were meant to be funny as a distraction from the horrible ending. Also, the way that hooch died. Like k9's do, and any animal that loves his owner, they will risk their own life for you, it's a reminder to the world to treat their dogs/pets/any animal good and humane, because you wouldnt believe how loyal animals are. They would put their lives on the line to save you, just out of love for you, and they don't ask for much in return. What person do you know that you can honestly say that about?? End animal cruelty now, and raise your children right, to respect and be kind to animals who are more capable of extraordinary things than you would realize. They are living breathing beings, and they should be respected and cherished. I cant even watch animal cops on animalplanet, because of how stupid and ignorant people are.

3507536,4,B000CCRMNE,"This is a great light and funny comedy that I think everybody can enjoy. It does have a bit of violence but it is not over the top with it. Hanks is his usual funny self and this is one of his early roles before he became the serious icon that he has become and rightly so. But the STAR of the movie is HOOCH the Dogue de Bourdeaux (or French Mastiff). This dog has the most charisma I have ever seen in a dog. The big red beautiful (in the eyes of the beholder)beast has everything it takes to steal the spotlight from Tom Hanks and everybody else in the movie. He is at the same time one of the ugliest and cutest animals ever on film. The dog has the chops, the look and the acting ability to make Turner and Hooch and all time favorite for both adults and kids (maybe not too young though cause of the crime plot) but watching Hanks play off the dog is hilarious.",1139184000,,867,4.046511627906977
3507537,4,B000CCRMNE,The feel good movie of the year... some gratuitous shots of Hooch's doggie balls kept me from giving it a 5 star rating.,1136937600,,120,4.260869565217392
3507538,2,B000CCRMNE,"Parents, I would strongly suggest pre-viewing this movie before allowing your younger children to see this movie. Near the begining of the movie, two people are murdered; and while you don't ""see"" it, you can hear it. You also get to see Scott Turner (actor Tom Hanks) running around in his underwear. Plus there are two or three sexually suggestive scenes - one is a very heavily suggestive scene.

If you could cut those scenes out, this would be a great film. You just have to love the mastiff playing Hooch, and the scenes where the dog is destroying things is just plain funny!",1105574400,,582,4.596153846153846
3507539,4,B000CCRMNE,"Honestly, Turner & Hooch is a fun movie but the best part is that it takes place in my home town. The movie was filmed entirely on location in Pacific Grove, California which is called ""Cypress Beach"" in the movie. ""City Hall"" is actually a local bank, and the church across the street is now a furniture store. The chase scene along the ocean was filmed about two blocks from my house. We love to watch it in slo-mo to catch little glimpses of familiar places and things.",1030406400,,472,4.375
3507540,5,B000CCRMNE,"This movie is by far Hanks' best film to date.  His awe inspiring performance is mezmorizing.  His on screen releationship with Hooch is titilating.  Without a doubt, one of the best movies of all time.  It has a little something for everyone.....with a very, very sad ending.  You'll laugh, you'll cry.  But all in all you will walk away with a little Hooch in you.
I have seen this movie a hundred or so times and I keep wishing that the movie just mind end a little different.  Please Mr. Director....there has to be an alternate ending.  Can't wait for a sequel.",1018137600,,566,4.480392156862745
3507541,4,B000CCRMNE,"This feel good comedy with apropriate moments of drama is one of the better human/dog movies to come out of Hollywood since Lassie and Rin Tin Tin.  A true tear jerker in the end, it is appealing to animal lovers and has plenty of lightheartedness throughout. In spite of the overshadowing premise that this is a ""cop movie"", it goes well beyond that.  Hanks is his usual funny yet at times poingnat self and the personality of his new ""partner"" Hooch, a fine Dogue de Bordeaux present a wonderful contrast.",1016236800,,507,4.622222222222222
3507542,5,B000CCRMNE,"Thoroughly charming - one of those rare films that is unabashedly what it means to be: a simple movie about a man learning to love something besides himself.  In this case, it happens to be a dog (a very unusual beloved beast).  There are little gems of performances, John McIntire as Amos, who brings the old saw about ""people look like their dogs"" to life, and Mare Winningham who really shows how powerful a performance understatement can make.  And of course Tom Hanks, who is as always the most charming human being in the world.  He also brings this very flawed person to admirable life. Then Hooch, of course, whose real name is sadly lacking in the list of credits.
The screenplay itself is a marvel of simple, unassuming comedy. If we want to get ""appreciatin'"", then Hanks' urgently yelled, ""I got a muffin for you, Hooch!"" is a far more immediate and understandable cry of the everyman than ""Reuben!  Reuben!""  And there can be no more perfect cry of human frustration than Hanks imploring Hooch (who has, after eating, sleeping, and going on his nightly ""rounds"", continued to howl all night), ""What?!  What?!""
Hooch's ending is very sad, especially if you have young ones in the house, but the sadness is redeemed by a hopeful ending.  I love this movie.  It never ceases to make me smile after the worst of days.  And no film can have a higher commendation than that.",993081600,,1381,4.6460905349794235
3507543,4,B000CCRMNE,One of the first Tom Hanks movies that has come out.  Turner and Hooch is about a Man and a dog bonding in a weird way.  Its absolutely hilarious.  You have to see it.  Also there are some good tear jerking moments.,992649600,,215,4.0476190476190474
3507544,2,B000CCRMNE,"Tom Hanks perfomance is very good, but the dog is very ugly indeed,I think with another dog would be better...The film  don't deserve more than two stars.",961804800,,154,4.703703703703703
3507545,3,B000CCRMNE,This movie is funny. But overall the acting isint grate the senery is not good but it is not bad. The script is dull exept for the funny parts but it did not keep me laphing there where just pousing of laphs not a lot of  laphs. I say rent this once but I don't think this is a buy type of movie.,956707200,,296,3.6984126984126986

8286491,3,B000CCRMNE,This is a good movie.  And for all the movies that Tom Hanks ha made especially after this.  Things like Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan.  This is my favorite movie of his.  It probably helps if you love dogs.  Which I do.  He plays a detective who  pretty much inheriates a dog who is the only witness to his masters murder.  And it goes from there.  Just a all around good movie.,1525046400,,386,4.178082191780822

But the kid doesn't die in SiS I guess. That probably would have made it weird, especially if the kid managed to get a girl pregnant before he died....",1522627200,,319,4.245901639344262
