8302705,3,B001FU796W,"Although the video was detailed and specific- and it will educate you as to the skulls, the testing that has been done and the research....but, I believe that there is something missing here. Tool marks, scratches, are nothing compared to the energy, the power, and the hope the skulls bring to us. I feel I need to address that.

What difference does it make if the skulls are tooled-on planet, Atlantis -or somewhere else in the universe? We still can't duplicate the craftsmanship or the energy that pours out of them... People are being healed just by being in the room with them. They are incredibly beautiful! The video focuses on discrediting the skulls much more than moving us into the realm of WHY? To know them is to love them. I'd suggest that anyone viewing this video have an up close and personal experience with a crystal skull before making any decisions.

The video serves a purpose however and it is well done for the discriminating, seeking viewer. It is a video that I believe everyone ought to see. It also shows one all the arguments against the validity of the skulls, but, remember while you watch, it doesn't show you the magic. Reserve your judgments until you see and experience one of these beauties!

8302706,5,B001FU796W,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted to learn more about the Mitchell-Hedges Skull, sometimes known as the ""Skull of Doom"". I can recommend this documentary to anyone who is similarly interested in that skull, and who would like to hear the story of its discovery, and see video of the skull and its claimed discoverer Anna Mitchell-Hedges.

At the time of writing this review, there is a very good review by another author which outlines what this documentary covers. I recommend that review, but would like to add the following comments.

As well as the Mitchell-Hedges skull, this documentary investigates the origins of 3 other crystal skulls:

1. The one in the British museum
2. The one in the Paris museum
3. The one anonymously mailed to the Smithsonian Institute in the USA

In my view, the Mitchell-Hedges skull is of vastly superior quality to the other three and should be considered seperately. The quartz of which it is constructed is glass-like and the skull overall looks anatomically exact, a perfect copy of a real human skull. It has a removable moving jawpiece which no other crystal skull has. The jawpiece and main skull were formed from the same original piece of crystal. I have yet to hear anyone explain how this could be achieved. Quartz crystal is extremely hard, yet brittle.

The 3 other skulls look just like something somebody possibly *could* create with some decent tools.... but not the Mitchell-Hedges skull. It's just so damn perfect that I have a hard time believing any human being made it.

This documentary decided to lump all 4 skulls together, as if the existance of the other 3 means they are all somehow related and that by proving that the others were man-made somehow proves the Mitchell-Hedges skull must be too.

The documentary triumphantly claims that the discovery under electron microscope of ""tool-marks"" proves the Mitchell-Hedges skull is man-made (I guess it proves the skull didn't just materialize out of thin air!). But it fails to answer the questions of who made it and when. Since the skull was claimed to have been found in 1000-year old ruins, the documentary tries to discredit Anna Mitchell-Hedges story of its discovery in 1924 as a fanciful fabrication. (I guess that if her story were true, then the skull would have to be at least 1000 years old!)

A few alleged tool-marks do not prove how the skull was made. What I would like to see, since the makers of this documentary know how it was done, is for them to re-create another Mitchell-Hedges skull. Create another skull with a removable jaw from a single piece of natural quartz crystal to the same high standards. That would prove it can be done. Until then, the Mitchell-Hedges skull remains an enigma, something which should not exist but does.

The final words of the documentary state:

""The evidence now shows that the famous skulls in three of the worlds great museums, and the skull of doom itself, were part of one of archeologies greatest frauds.

""Anna Mitchell-Hedges story was one of its greatest fabrications. Science has revealed how the crystal skulls were made, but we may never know exactly why, or by whom.""

I myself am not convinced. Please view this DVD, and decide for yourself!",1247702400,9,3226,4.834845735027224
8302707,4,B001FU796W,"The legend of the 13 crystal skulls has inspired both adventurers and storytellers.  The legend maintains that once the 13 skulls are united they will unlock universal knowledge.  The inspiration for the most recent Indiana Jones movie was a man named Hedges whose daughter found a crystal skull in the 1920's in modern-day Belize, which he named the Skull of Doom.  Hedges' adopted daughter kept the story alive claiming she found the skull buried under archaeological debris and swore to its authenticity, although oddities in her story brought about questions as to the truth of her story.

This DVD documents the Smithsonian's attempt to use modern technology to authenticate the Skull of Doom and two other crystal skulls, one in London and one in Paris.  The British acquired their skull in 1897 and the French in 1978, but both skulls are said to be Aztec.  The two skulls brought to Europe were found to both be owned by Eugene Boban, an antiques dealer who had previously lived in Mexico City and brought the skulls back with him to Paris.

This film does an excellent job of covering the different legends and new age following of the skulls.  Some beliefs are that the skulls are from the Aztecs, Atlantis or even outer space.  Modern day technology is used to test the crystal quartz skulls for tool marks to determine the age of the skulls.  The use of electron microscopes show marks from carving tools and scientists determine if the tools are modern day or ancient.  This DVD will interest those who want to unlock the mystery of the skulls and see how modern research can make or break a legend.",1227225600,18,1612,4.741935483870968
