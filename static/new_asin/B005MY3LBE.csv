8479951,1,B005MY3LBE,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted to see and hear what hot-rod flathead engines were all about. I enjoyed the story, but when it came to hear the engines in action - that audio was buried beneath the director's favorite music which had nothing to do with the narrative at hand. The music was completely overbearing and I found it very irritating. I later went to a couple of web-sites of the engine builders featured in the DVD and was rewarded with the lovely audio of hot-rod engines in action - clean and unadulterated!",1414368000,,526,4.5473684210526315

8479953,5,B005MY3LBE,"If you went looking for this, you won't be disappointed.  Good footage of traditional rods/music, but also a lot of interviews of people who you may recognize if this is your thing.  Reminds me a little of mad fabricators but more polished.",1387843200,,240,4.690476190476191
8479954,5,B005MY3LBE,"I am enjoying the movie much, I have watched it several times, it makes for a great  background sound trac when in the shop.",1366588800,3,124,4.166666666666667
8479955,5,B005MY3LBE,"If you love flatheads and want to sit back and enjoy an in depth overview of the history, development and modern usage of this historic engine, this is the documentary for you. The soundtrack can be annoying and seems to target a different audience, but the information covered and the interviews included easily overcome that minor flaw. This is a well done film and all flathead fans should be grateful for such a thorough review of this iconic engine. Hopefully, the builders highlighted in this film will continue to inspire other motor heads to keep these engines running as long as gasoline is available.",1340323200,6,610,4.875
8479956,5,B005MY3LBE,"I loved this quality dvd, It was well worth the $ and have watched several times and seem to catch something new each time. My dad is a reformed hotrodder from the 50's who now restores flathead cars and he was thrilled to see each of the scenerios the movie represents. Highly recommended!
