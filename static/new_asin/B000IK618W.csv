8146034,5,B000IK618W,"If you are like me and love bonus material, but found the ""Special Editions"" lacking you will definitely benefit from the purchase of this DVD.  When I bought this here on Amazon it was only $3 ""new"" w/free shipping, but having watched the whole disc I would have paid the price of a feature for the content provided.  So, it was a gamble that paid off in spades!

Over 3 hours of material covering the first 3 films.  The ""Making the Trilogy"" segments can be played individually or as a seamless feature.

I highly suggest acquiring this disc to complete your collection!",1333411200,4,1254,4.568807339449541
8146035,5,B000IK618W,"I can never get enough of the making of features of any movie I have enjoyed.  This footage is one of the best Bonus Features packages out there.  It is not only well documented and generous in it's length and depth of information, it also a time capsule of one of the best times in moviemaking.  The envelopes in every area of film making were bursting with new creativity, new technology, and it seemed the future of story telling through the art of film were truly becoming limitless.  And to see the youthful Steven Spielberg and George Lucas brings back the same feelings of hope and energy I experienced in those days of my youth.  Every movie should be so well represented.",1316476800,2,680,4.540983606557377
8146036,5,B000IK618W,"If you are into the the Indiana Jones trilogy (now quadrilogy?), then this ""bonus material"" documentary disc is for you. It's over 3 hours of footage (much not found anywhere else) covering everything from the initial concept for the films, to special effects, music, and stunts. Good stuff for the Indy addict!",1312416000,2,311,5.0
8146037,4,B000IK618W,"Reviewers opted to ""diss"" this movie but I thought it was excellent, exactly what a person should expect from an Indiana Jones adventure.  The fact that Harrison Ford still performed most of his own stunts is amazing.  And they all looked like they were having a good time doing it.  Far-fetched?  Sure, but aren't all of the Indiana Jones movies the same?  Interesting?  Absolutely.  There was a lot of tongue-in-cheek scenes and dialogue if you paid attention.  The only downside is that, realistically, this is probably going to be the last Indiana Jones movie.",1226793600,,564,4.925531914893617
