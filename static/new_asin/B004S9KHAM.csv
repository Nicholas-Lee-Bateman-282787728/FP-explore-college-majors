8439589,4,B004S9KHAM,"This is a great film i saw on DVD. Most original story of our country.

But the best things director gets it right is of side characters casting - there is that fat school teacher which is a classic. There is mom of school girl and the a working class guy who says i use it only to p*** now... when prostitute asks him to come with him. There are friends of Shreyas - blind guy, American dude, limping guy, guys from Bihar living out... i just know them all. Simply great casting. Gresat story and lines.",1304467200,,504,4.195876288659794
