1050589,5,6305559007,"My 2 year old got this for his birthday in March.  We watch it ALL of the time.  He sings all of the songs and does the little hand motions that Steve does when singing.  He knows all of the planets in the solar system and when he sees something that resembles saturn (any ball with what looks like rings), he yells to anyone around - 'SATURN HAS ICY RINGS'.  No my younger son, 15 months, dances and runs into the room when he hears Steve.",1004054400,11,440,4.0813953488372094
1050590,5,6305559007,I liked this video very much. I thought that this was a great way to learn about science and the Planets in our solar system! I loed the Super Steve and Super Blue bit!  I hope that more tapes like this come out. I have  this one and the Pajama Party one.,958348800,3,255,3.8846153846153846
1050591,5,6305559007,"I have purchased almost all of the videos for my son.  His color-identifying has increased; he counts very well, and he sings and dances (esp to the Birthday video!) in time with the video's activities.  I  feel comfortable letting him watch these, as there is no violence, and it  teaches him alot!  Did I mention he was only two?",947721600,2,331,4.5423728813559325

My little niece and nephew watch some Blue's Clues, they like where Steve and Blue are singing the planet songs! They would also like the beginning before the video cause the Nick and Jr. animals are Dinosaurs!",1292976000,2,365,4.630769230769231

7891923,5,6305559007,"I acknowledge the flaw pointed out by another reviewer that going around with a magnifying glass looking at things does not exactly constitute an experiment, but it's easy to forgive that since there are so many other good things in this video.  This is my personal favorite, and my three and a half son loves it too.  As a result, we've had to reenact the cyclone experiment and traipse around with a magnifying glass.  The planets song is the highlight of the whole tape: a fun, catchy way to remember them all.",1084406400,6,513,4.554347826086956
7891924,3,6305559007,"Please see my review of ""Blue's Big Pajama Party"" for my rationale in reviewing these Blue's Clues tapes. Briefly, I'm reviewing only those tapes that seem to me to present some problem, and my lowest rating of any of them will be 3 stars. It's an otherwise excellent series.
I understand well that the material that's presented here needs to be given at a preschooler's level. There's bound to be a great deal of simplification, or even over-simplification. But it should be *correct* as far as it goes. Scientific illiteracy is a growing problem in our increasingly technological society, and it would be best to start things off on the right foot, so to speak, in a child's science education. Unfortunately, neither of the episodes in this tape satisfactorily conveys the lessons they're intended to because the information they give is either misleading or flat-out wrong.
In the first episode, we're looking for clues about what ""science experiment"" Blue wants to perform today. Some of the experiments we see in the beginning are excellent examples. They run along the lines of, ""What happens if...?"" ""Let's find out!"" This is actually the essence of a good science experiment. But the ""science experiment"" Blue is pointing to with the clues -- and therefore the one thing about the episode preschoolers are most likely to remember -- isn't an experiment at all. It's just a demonstration of an interesting phenomenon. It's also something that's just as readily observable in the bathtub, although that isn't pointed out. No question is asked, and no answer is found. That's not an experiment.
Not even the otherwise helpful ""Planet Song"" is without problems. Blue and Steve ""skiddoo"" into a picture on the wall for this segment. Steve's attention is first drawn to the picture when a fireball, sporting a firey tail, swooshes past the inside of the frame. ""A meteor!"" says Steve. ""In space!"" WRONG. Meteors of that appearance are strictly *atmospheric* phenomena; they are NEVER encountered in space. And they make no sound, not even in the atmosphere. (For some obervers, there's an impression of sound associated with some meteors, but this is actually caused by electromagnetic interference that they're probably picking up on their fillings.)
The second episode is little better. It's ostensibly about recycling. ""Recycle, recycle, recycle!"" is chanted repeatedly, like a mantra. It seems the viewer is expected to take this as an article of religious faith, since it's never explained why recycling is a good idea, other than Steve's dislike of wasting packaging materials. They needn't have delved into complex environmental issues; a simple ""So we don't run out!"" or ""Where will we put so much garbage?"" would have been enough. (An old Sesame Street episode from my youth had a segment showing what happened at a garbage dump. It was fascinating, and would not have been out of place here.) But just as the ""science experiment"" turned out not to be one, the closest we get to actual recycling here is when Steve chucks some recyclables into the appropriate bin. Everything else is actually *reuse*. A child is likely to get an entirely wrong impression of what recycled goods are like. This is especially true of the ""Recycle Town"" to which Blue and Steve ""skiddoo"", as well as the recycled thing Blue clues she wants to make (a guitar from a paper towel tube, empty tissue box, and rubber bands.) How about a complicated looking machine that takes in waste paper at one end and spits out clean, new paper at the other? That sounds silly, but it actually would have provided a truer picture both of the recycling process and of recycled products.
Children will no doubt enjoy this tape. I know mine do. But it would be nice if they were being given lessons that weren't so misleading at the same time.",1042761600,5,3815,4.934681181959564
