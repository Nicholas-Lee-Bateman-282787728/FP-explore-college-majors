6928411,3,B00RDEIV4I,"Great acting by all, but the story line was rather deep and lengthy.",1437177600,,68,4.3076923076923075
6928412,5,B00RDEIV4I,"This movie deals with the subject of suicide,which many families deal with. Jackson(BooBoo Stewart)wants answers as to why his father took his own life,answers that he may not be able to handle,says his counselor(Kevin Sorbo). The movie handles the subject with much respect and diginity. Families should watch this together and discuss it afterwards. It could very well save lives!",1435968000,11,382,5.383333333333334
6928413,5,B00RDEIV4I,"This is a very comforting, uplifting movie for anyone who has experienced a death, suicide, or thoughts of suicide (or knows someone who has). It deals with some difficult, thought-provoking subjects in ways that are easy to understand and relate to without glamorizing the darker themes the way many Hollywood films seem to do. The acting is very natural, making the story believable and very realistic, as if I could be watching a friend's life rather than a movie. Though the pace lags a bit and starts out slowly, it gets more engaging in the latter half, bringing more suspense that deepens the character development. The movie is quite serious due to the subject matter, yet it has a few light-hearted moments as well. It is a very good family movie, though probably too dark in themes for very young children. It seems aimed at teens and young adults most of all, as well as anyone who can relate to the story. The three lead actors (Booboo Stewart, Kevin Sorbo, and Rebeca Robles) did an especially great job portraying their character roles.  This film has a good message that I think anyone could benefit from, and I highly recommend it to those interested in watching it.",1433548800,18,1182,4.737864077669903
6928414,3,B00RDEIV4I,"The Climb for Hope, the 1991 Everest/Canada Expedition, was essentially begun as a fund raising event for Rett Syndrome by the father of a young, teenage girl afflicted with this disease. The film is well narrated by Leslie Nielsen. It is part travelogue with some nice footage of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and some interesting shots of the countryside encountered along the journey to Everest. The trek to Everest is certainly an arduous one and not for the faint of heart, as the viewer will see.

There are some great shots of Mount Everest, as well as some excellent climbing footage. The weather was poor for climbing, however, with the jet stream dropping early. No one made the summit, and one climber was injured, requiring that the climber be lowered in a bivvy sack some way down the mountain. There is some footage of the rescue which is interesting, as it shows just how precarious such a rescue may be.

While the film may have won the Gold Medal for the Best Informational/Documentary at the New York International Film Festival, the actual video has lengthy blackouts separating segments of the film. I am assuming, perhaps wrongly, that the film had been edited for television and commercials inserted, which for the video release were then removed, accounting for the blackouts. These blackouts are somewhat jarring to the viewer and break up the enjoyable flow of the film. This is a film primarily of interest to Everest junkies and those who support the fundraising efforts for Rett Syndrome.",1000166400,,1519,4.906614785992218

6928421,3,B00RDEIV4I,to me the story is kind of slow and depressing i only bought it because i thought would be a good movie not about suicide and i just could not get into like other characters or boo boo stewarts  and the other reason is i only got it because if boo boo stewart  and do NOT LEAVE ME ANY NASTY REMARK ABOUT MY REVIEW!,1456099200,,314,3.890625

6928423,1,B00RDEIV4I,I've ordered this movie for my daughter twice. Both times it was another movie burned on the disc. It was a Christmas gift. Very disappointing?,1451260800,,143,4.76
6928424,1,B00RDEIV4I,"The wrong movie was in this case. The case was Hope Bridge, but the movie was not. This was a Christmas gift and it was completely wrong movie. Ridiculous and very upset.",1451001600,,170,4.34375
6928425,1,B00RDEIV4I,Do not purchase from this seller. We went to watch Hope Bridge today after I opened it as a gift and though the DVD says Hope Bridge on it the actually movie that played was not Hope Bridge but 3 mini movies from the Bible. Highly disappointed!!,1451001600,,245,4.23404255319149

6928428,5,B00RDEIV4I,"I received Hope Bridge in early November and last night we sat down to watch it . To our sad surprise we watched two previews and then instead of Hope Bridge our feature was The Story of Ruth . The jacket had Hope Bridge on the cover and the DVD inside had Hope Bridge on it , but it wasn't on the DVD. Amazon I have purchased hundreds of DVD's from you but this was a real big error . I just threw it into the waste basket and ate the cost . To send it back would have been a cost to me and a inconvenience I guess we will never see this fine movie.",1447804800,,550,3.75

6928434,2,B00RDEIV4I,"I really like Kevin Sorbo but honestly, this movie dragged on and could have been much more effective in 1/2 the time. My wife and I love faith based movies and this was the first one we have watched where we kept thinking,  come on get moving.  I am sorry but it just did not do anything for us.  God bless.",1443312000,3,308,4.016393442622951
6928435,3,B00RDEIV4I,The message is powerful and worth the buy. Be sure to watch special features. The acting is weak overall. Plot and characters need a bit more development.,1442361600,3,154,4.7407407407407405
6928436,5,B00RDEIV4I,"My first test of a movie is if I can remember anything good about it the next day. This movie passed that test, as I was able to recall many important aspects about the ways ""suicide grief"" are dealt with-or not dealt with. Kevin Sorbo is very believable in his role of helping a hurting teenage boy dealing with his father's suicide. The lesson of forgiveness is a highlight of the movie.",1440979200,,389,4.416666666666667
6928437,5,B00RDEIV4I,"Interesting perspective on loss and shame. I wasn't sure where it was going at first, but it is worth following through. Favorite actor was the kid who got beaten up at the lockers. His part was brief, but very well portrayed. I really felt for him.",1440720000,6,249,4.434782608695652
