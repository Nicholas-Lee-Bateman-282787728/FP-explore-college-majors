8656329,2,B00K6K9GP4,"In 70+ years of the modern UFO phenomenon there has never been one piece of evidence physical or personal that has been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that their are  ET civilizations or craft that have made contact with Earth, or that there is any proof of ET's. Personally I believe that if there are ET's they are demons(fallen angels) posing as these friendly ET's. Their supernatural power, to me, is the only way that ET's have been able to hide any real evidence. I think they are the orbs of light and some of the reports of lights that people see and the other creatures that people report. I don't believe they are responsible for or use physical craft. These are either experimental govt. air and spacecraft, conventional aircraft, radio controlled consumer craft, and enviromental factors that we can and can't explain. Remember ball lightning and balls of light from volcanoes weren't known until the 20th century. Just because a craft performs manuevers that we've never seen before doesn't mean that no govt. could have invented it.",1479081600,,1052,4.844444444444444
