8405508,2,B003TY2SGS,"Revenge of the Creature, 1955 film

The story begins in a tributary of the Upper Amazon. [Note the same scenes as in the earlier movie.] They have come to catch the gill-man. [What about those gill-women?] Can evolution explains these creatures? A stork isn't cautious. A man in a diving suit goes into the water. The gill-man attacks him! Shots are fired to drive him away. Explosives will be detonated to stun underwater creatures, who float to the surface. [What will this do the boat?] One of these is the gill-man! It will be captured for ""scientific study"" and brought to America. But it is in a coma. [Note their 4x5 Graflex cameras used by photographers.] The gill-man is walked for artificial respiration. It works! The creature tries to escape. They net and chain him. People come to view this exhibit. A man feeds porpoises. [Don't try this with sharks!] Fish are offered to the gill-man.

There is a romantic triangle. ""Flippy"" is trained to perform for food (like many humans). A porpoise is almost as smart as a pig. They begin their tests on gill-man. Pavlovian conditioning via electric shocks? ""He's learning fast."" [Note the stream of bubbles from gill-man's head.] That outdoor scene's lighting is too flat to be real. They will test the brain waves of the gill-man and other physical traits. The gill-man learns fast. ""Not too close, Helen."" Things go wrong! ""He broke the chain."" Freed, he throws a man into the pool. People run in fear! He heads to the ocean. [Does his walk remind you of those Mummy movies?] He is going south. Will he come back to land? A dog barks and howls, the disappears. [Was this scene repeated in ""Jaws""?] How long can gill-man stay out of water? Clete and Helen go swimming. Will gill-man follow them? Yes.

Clete and Helen go dancing. ""What do we know about love?"" They walk outside. The gill-man follows. Is he attracted by the jazz music? He takes Helen away to the sea. She screams, climbs onto the buoy, but is pulled off. The police order the people indoors. Two students stop and find big trouble. The police follow the footprints. ""Don't take any chances!"" The creature must stay close to water. A half-dozen men find Helen, the creature roars and walks toward them. Helen is rescued and the shooting begins. The creature sinks into the sea. [Is this the end of gill-man? No.]

The story of gill-man does not have the legs that monsters on land have (Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolves, etc.). It must be the creature, other lower budget movies seem to be more popular. The threat of a monster from the sea goes back to the Dark Ages and the story of Beowulf.",1476576000,,2615,4.678260869565217
