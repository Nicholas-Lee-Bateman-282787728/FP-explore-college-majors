7781401,2,B01H9HCOP0,"I'm left with a bad aftertaste as the documentary ends.

We learn, only at the end of the film, that the convincing, disguised, female NSA tech is an actress, speaking for a number of agents, her words gleaned from their many statements to the film's director, statements that are not on the record.

But let's let even that pass. Let's assume the statements, every one of them, is accurate. So what? What is the intent of the film? To my understanding, it's that the NSA and CIA (and probably the FBI and DIA and other clandestine agencies protecting America) are operating without the American people knowing about, discussing, and blessing their activities.

How is that different from when we broke the German and Japanese codes during WWII? Was the American public made aware of our cryptographic teams? Did we disclose our capabilities to our enemies? Did we try to come to agreement with our enemies on which codes would or would not be broken? Or did we recognize that we were at war, as we are now, and use our capabilities as best possible.

I'm not suggesting that our 3-letter agencies should not be supervised, but it appears they well and truly are. The heads of these agencies have been mature, often military, leaders, one after the other.

Another problem I have with the film's director is that he lets Iran off easy. He has an Iranian-American blast the use of the Stuxnet virus as not having achieved much, in fact having been counter-productive. Yes, but what if it had succeeded? Monday morning quarterbacking is easy. The devil's bargain with Iran made by President Obama -- happily counting on the ayatollahs to keep their word -- would have been moot. The film never mentions the Reuters report that ""Iran barred two IAEA inspectors from entering the country. The IAEA rejected Iran's reasons for the ban and said it fully supported the inspectors, which Tehran has accused of reporting wrongly that some nuclear equipment was missing.""

Breaking it down, I see:
1. A nation of 80 million repeatedly declaring an intent to annihilate a neighboring nation of 8 million and working hard to achieve weaponry to achieve that goal.
2. An attempt made by Israel (and America) to defend itself that wasn't very successful.

If we think that viruses like Stuxnet would not have been created by any country capable of it had not the evil Israelis and Americans led the way, we are naive fools, deluded beyond belief.

I look to documentaries to inform me. This one did not. After watching it, I felt I basically knew about as much as I did when the film started: Stuxnet had been created by Israel and America to derail Iran's nuclear weapon capability but had not succeeded. That could have been done in 45 minutes, with the rest of the film showing us how modern civilization relies on technology that is vulnerable to hackers anywhere in the world...and what should be done to protect our country and ourselves.

A second star for the many interesting visuals, especially the row upon row of centrifuges. Thousands of centrifuges, we can learn from Wikipedia, and far more than would be needed for peaceful purposes.",1494806400,4,3135,4.801484230055658

7781405,4,B01H9HCOP0,"The only thing that upsets me is as always how some media people lump the responsibility unfairly or completely on one administration when its clear that the one blamed is not the only one involved, IE NAFTA is also a good example.

As stated in Wiki's description of ""OG"" Bush Jr was the one that originated the plan but no mention of that during the film.

Operation Olympic Games was a covert and still unacknowledged campaign of sabotage by means of cyber disruption, directed at Iranian nuclear facilities by the United States and likely Israel. As reported, it is one of the first known uses of offensive cyber weapons.[1] Started under the administration of George W. Bush in 2006, Olympic Games was accelerated under President Obama, who heeded Bushs advice to continue cyber attacks on Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz.[1] Bush believed that the strategy was the only way to prevent an Israeli conventional strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.[1]

Things that make you go 'Hmmmm'.",1492992000,,992,5.0
7781406,5,B01H9HCOP0,"This documentary is a masterpiece for one single reason: it reveals something that has been and still is brewing in the wings of many governments and that can lead to a nuclear war directly from cyberspace, without being able to trace the starting point, hence the attacker without information from inside the circle that started it. And when the cyber virus or hostile program or simply malware is active where it is supposed to cause harm it is impossible to stop it. Imagine such a beast in the nuclear defense of the nuclear powers in this world.

The particular malware used in this case is Flame first as a precursor and then Stuxnet, code name Olympic Games. The target was Iran in 2010-2011, their centrifuges enriching uranium, and the objective was to make these centrifuges misbehave causing their self-destruction. This Stuxnet was also an artificial intelligence malware since it could circulate in a cyber system till it could find its target, it could install itself in that target, observe for a while after upgrading itself from the Internet, then determine the moment it becomes active and starts sabotaging its target. The most vicious part of it is that it sends to the various controlling systems and units messages of everything being normal as usual. When the controllers find out something is wrong because of their observation of a misbehavior or misconduct of the machines targeted by the malware, it is too late. It is also clear this malware can attack some equipment, like a nuclear plant and cause a tremendous catastrophe and a great number of casualties.

Today we can say who did it because someone from inside decided, when they realized they were on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe that could have been hundreds of times worse than Chernobyl, to leak the program onto the Internet and then to leak some details to the director of this documentary a couple of years later.

The covert operation against Iran was conducted under Obama and with his consent, a least his more or less passive consent. He will sign an executive order after the fiasco of the operation imposing the responsible services to require and obtain the Presidents approval, just the same way as for nuclear weapons. The accomplice who was probably a lot more than just a second fiddle, rather the first lead violin or guitar if not the whole orchestra with Obama as the solo tenor, the accomplice was Israel and its Mossad. To know the grim picture of this Mossad, just watch some episodes of NCIS in which it is more than present, actually lethally present. They are specialists of covert twisted and perverse operations that they consider as normal since it is only gathering vital intelligence for Israel and cleaning up the plate afterwards by killing all informers to leave no witnesses behind. NCIS is not a documentary and this vision is maybe slightly excessive but the plan behind Stuxnet was covert twisted and perverse.

The objective was to destroy the nuclear facilities of Iran by making the centrifuges explode. That would have blown up and out tremendous quantities of radioactive uranium, killed many people in the facility and around it, irradiated probably millions of people in Iran and then it would have spread like a cloud all over the world. Covert, twisted, perverse AND LETHAL. This malware was a potential Weapon of Mass Destruction. The only defense of Obama in this situation is that he had inherited the baby from George W. Bush and he was not informed in due time and before it was actually going. We can even think that if it had not been leaked out onto the Internet in a way we cannot know it would not have been stopped. The New York Times says the malware was by some accident downloaded onto the personal work station of some worker in the Iranian nuclear facility and from there it jumped onto the Internet. But then the Iranians knew and they protected the facility. Only a small proportion of the centrifuges were disturbed and had to be taken care of. It slowed down Irans progress in their nuclear program, but after the event Iran caught up with a vengeance.

The documentary then explains how the Iranians decided to launch two cyberattacks onto the USA, particularly their banks to show them that if the USA can do it, Iran and many other people can do it too. Such cyberattacks can be absolutely anonymous, untraceable and yet the Iranians made them traceable so that the USA could get the message. Obama got it. He signed the executive order I have already mentioned and he started moving towards a diplomatic treatment of the situation after the second election. Israel and their Prime Minister were furious and rejected in the United Nations the Iranian deal. But I guess Obama was furious enough to have been manipulated to keep some cool distrust and distance towards the Israeli Prime Minister known as BIBI.

But you must understand that we know about it, and we are still here to know about it because it failed because of a leak. But any US President can use such technological malware to destroy someone, some country he or she considers an adversary as the US Coast Guard says so well in its latest Cyber Strategy report (June 2015). When you read this report you find out the US Coast Guard is central in the fight against cybercrime in their domain (protection of the USA by protecting the oceans, ports and harbors, rivers and lakes) and that the objective is not only defensive. It is worded in such a way that the expert hackers they recruit or hire are supposed to defend Cyberspace, enable operations and protect infrastructure. Cyberspace is in no way a national reality; It is a global reality that evades control and protection within the borders of any particular country. The USA and the US Coast Guard have no international mission entrusted to them by the international community to defend cyberspace. They should be at the spearhead of an international collective action to defend cyberspace for everyone with everyone because, as Lincoln would say, we are dealing here with the cyberspace of humanity, for humanity and by humanity. The US Coast Guard will of course say that operations are only the operations of harbors, ports, rivers, Maritime Transportation System (MTS). But the word can have a wider understanding than that and it could cover all operations necessary for the Maritime Transportation System to function without any problem and since the best defense is to attack, the best way to protect yourself against cyber malware is to attack those who stand in your way in any fashion you can imagine and that bother you.

Right now the President of the USA is confronted to North Korea and their nuclear ambition. Who can say he will not impulsively start some kind of cyber war against North Korea or China or whatever? What is surprising is that Russia supposedly meddled with the US Presidential election from Cyberspace and supposedly the FBI, CIA, DHS and DoD have the proof that meddling came from Russia, and whats more from the Russian government. The Russians are known to be phenomenal hackers and computing technicians, engineers and scientists. If they left behind something that identifies them, it is because they wanted to be identified. What is the objective? Destroy Trump? Isolate him? Create chaos in Congress and the USA? Bring Trump to the brink of nuclear war? To wake up the world that this man is able to impulsively jump into the abyss? Maybe a little bit of them all! And maybe even some more political considerations. And who did the Russians inform and coordinate their careless action with? In this world three countries are the victims of sanctions: Iran, Russia and North Korea. How long will it last without going boom? The three countries are proving very resilient. The Russians supposedly helped get Clinton down. That was easy she was not enthusing her supporters with a vision because she did not have a vision. They supposedly managed both executive and legislative power, and now judicial power, to be going in one single direction and they knew that situation would make the Republicans so vain and divided that they would run into the brick wall and smite their brains out. Thats exactly what they are doing, our Republicans. How long indeed are there going to last? And if they become too anxious about the future, how long will they try to keep their president within some decent limits before he presses on a button of any type like in Syria or in Afghanistan. In eight weeks we have done more than in the eight years before us. Vanitas vanitatum, omnis vanitas!

So get this documentary that was produced under Obama and before Trump, and reflect seriously on the blind alley in which we are and start leaking all the secrets you may know. One of these secrets might save the world.

2. Continued to oppose, through action, the nuclear program by a country (Iran) that continuously and actively harms and plans on destroying counties that Iran's religious zealots and Ayatollahs point a finger at.
Iran continues to very aggressively spend hundreds of millions of dollars and send soldiers and weapons of war to support the Syrian regime to murder it's own Syrian people who are fighting for freedom from the oppression of the regime.

But there is absolutely no mention of Kim Zetter or her book anywhere in the movie, by that I mean not even in the acknowledgments section.

The Israeli's took the the Stuxnet covert action too far outing the Obama administration's role in the attack on another sovereign nation.

There is a lot of technical information, and I am not especially a techy, but I think I understood it well. What is so good about this documentary is that after watching it you have a much better understanding of the foundations of why the U.S. and the world are in such a hacking crisis right now. I have heard criticism about the film because the producer was unable to get anyone to reveal much about the Stuxnet episode. But he did take every nugget of information he was able to glean and weave them into a quilt of a story so to speak. The production values of the film were well done.

Naturally, most of the topics brought in by the movie were too familiar too me, but a part that I wasn't specially aware was the history of the first nuclear reactor in Iran. Although it's the same old story about the US government international meddlings, it was interesting to see how this was part of a political and cultural play, specially from the side of Iran.

It was also interesting to see the real characters involved with Stuxnet and other cyber issues. And while I liked the fake female witness, I did miss Kim Zetter, writer of probably the first book about Stuxnet. She's an excellent journalist, well informed and regular contributor to Wired and other cyber security media, and I think it was the missing voice. Given her first hand expertise in the matter.

The basic argument is that more transparency is necessary -- the United States and Israel (probably) launched a sophisticated attack on Iran's nuclear centrifuges and Iran launched two very effective counter attacks as a warning. Only when we understand the pros and cons of this sort of warfare, can we hope to ""control"" that sort of warfare.

We live in an entirely new world, and we need to find a way to control this technology -- or face the serious possibility of major financial and human catastrophe.

7781544,1,B01H9HCOP0,"At first I was really fascinated but then it went South so quick. Soon it just descended into US politics. One problem you have with a documentary like this is your major sources are not named for what ever reason and as such it becomes impossible for the viewer to make any judgment on the accuracy of this movie. We have no real evidence on who made Stuxnet .

It is presumed that the US and Israel governments were behind it. It makes sense but we cannot prove it. This show proves no evidence either. This does not stop the show from not only assuming that but also going quite anti Israel in some of its comments. In fact the US seems to be praised only if a point can be scored against Israel.

Firstly it is not the first cyber attack by one country on another for example Estonia was probably hit by a Russian government cyber attack in 2007. That one was a lot more serious and shut down most of the country. In 2008, a similar attack was done probably by Russian government too against Georgia.

What we do know is that Stuxnet is that it did slow down for a short time the Iranian nuclear program and probably had little effect. While watching the show, I was thinking maybe part of the problem was someone strengthened the virus because it was not doing that much. According to some research it appears that it is hard to destroy centrifuges by use of cyber attacks as they are not that vulnerable. Then the movie goes on that the Iranian atomic bomb program was stopped by Obama in a treaty. What planet do these people live in? At the very best it will stop it for 10 years assuming the Iranians keep to it.

That the cyber attack on shamoon (dist track) attack was done by Iranian, we are given no evidence and I am not aware of any? However, their mention of the Iranian attack on the US banks, is almost true and its possible that revenge for Stuxnet was the reason.",1469836800,5,1883,4.3107344632768365
7781545,2,B01H9HCOP0,"This garbage documentary 'Zero Days' can't figure out what story it wants to promote, so long as it attacks the apparent actions of the US government. They bring on a former NSA employee of who exposes~ it was Israel that changed the Stuxnet code to be way too aggressive which leads to discovery. Her introduction is treated as a pivotal and important step in the story, but the filmmaker disregards it to smear American efforts as we are all now potentially exposed (again, thanks to Israel according to this person we were set up to view as The Source) and thus rather than focusing on the misguided a action of a closely involved partner, blames the US for taking a necessary action. An action made necessary by Bush crippling our options due to his invasion of Iraq, but necessary regardless.

Also ~The Source~ is obviously an actor and then it is revealed that YES she is an actor bringing actual ""testimony"" to life.  So spooky and clandestine~

Obviously I am very biased in my belief that this country does what it takes to make us and the world a safer place and that the conversations about transparency and restraint are important ones, but there are ways to go about it.

Had Iran done this to us we would consider it an act of war. The overall effort included assassinations of key Iranian figures. It was not clear whether the US was involved in this aspect The effort slowed the Iranians down for a while, but only a while, and the aggressive propagation of the virus led to its spread worldwide to many other types of facilities and it discovery.

7781578,4,B01H9HCOP0,"I'm giving this film 4 stars mostly because it's a huge eye-opener that every responsible citizen should see. The film really takes you to ground zero and makes you part of the story, questioning the secrecy surrounding Stuxnet without casting blame and spewing venom a la Michael Moore. Unfortunately the film just assumes that greater transparency on the Stuxnet hack is needed without really exploring why maintaining secrecy might still be critical. If you're going to make an argument, to be convincing, you need to really look at the counter-arguments, which this film doesn't do. It also is in dire need of more editing; 1 hr 15 minutes or even 1.5 hours would have been perfect, but 2 is way too long for this documentary, which seems to just go on and on. There was also a bit of gratuitous dramatic imagery; I'm thinking in particular of the scene in which a balloon in over-inflated by a Stuxnet-infected PLC and pops...and the popping is just shown over and over again. The first pop very effectively demonstrates the danger; after 3 or 4 times, I just started laughing - why is the film trying so hard to show what is so obvious? But for all the film's faults, I felt it was very compelling overall.",1469059200,18,1212,4.668224299065421

5 of 5, for sure. The only real issue I had was with the digitalozed actor playing the part of an informant. While I do very much understand why CIA and NSA agents cannot, on the record, talk about understandably classified operations and such, the actress was portrayed as an agent, so her testimony is difficult to verify.

7781631,5,B01H9HCOP0,"""Zero Days"" is an exciting, factual, investigative documentary/thriller about Stuxnet, the computer worm that did severe damage to and delayed Iran's possible developmment of a nuclear weapons capability.

It's an excellent and highly informative film about the origin, backround, development, implementation, behind-the scenes discovery and investigation of, and fallout from The Stuxnet worm. It also ends with a part about the general subject of State-Sponsored Cyber Warfare.

The production values of this film are flawless in every way.

The content of the film is presented in such a way that it will be informative and entertaning whether or not you have any prior technical knowledge of computer malware.

It is a film of great importance -- the less prior knowledge one has of Stuxnet and the potentional consequences of Cyber Warfare, the more important the fim will be to the viewer.

I am an IT-internet-PC scecurity and privacy geek. I followed The Stuxnet Story intensively, reading everything available online about it. I was fascinated and obsessed with reading about it. Yet, not only did I learn new information about Stuxnet and the story surrounding it from this film, but the film also puts a ""face"" on the story and givesan important new perspectives to the story.

While It is in theatres now, IMHO viewing Zero Days on Amazon Instant Video is the best way to view this film, because the big screen would add little, if anything, to experienceing the film, it's cheaper than a theater ticket, but most importantly, viewing it online allows you to repeat sections of the film that might at first slip by without your total comprehension.

It's a highly informative, yet entertaining film and an excellent film in every way, and will be of great interest to most of you. I can't recommend it highly enough. I am certain that any of you with the slightest interest in the subject will enjoy it, will learn new facts about and a new perspective on The Stuxnet Story, and wil not be disappointed.",1468454400,23,2015,4.979166666666667
7781632,4,B01H9HCOP0,"Truly enjoyed this. While it dived in and explained Stuxnet better than anyone else has before, I appreciated the artistic license with the way that Gibney presented the NSA view but I felt a little cheated on it too.",1468368000,,217,4.589743589743589
7781633,5,B01H9HCOP0,"Amazing film has shown me we need to think out of the box.  Well done, riveting.  Connect the dots and it helps one to understand current events.  A warning to America of how vulnerable we really are.",1468368000,,200,4.351351351351352
7781634,5,B01H9HCOP0,"A highly competent, well done telling of the events surrounding the first true cyber weapon and the implications for the globe.  The interviews with the key players in government and the interesting format of the documentary give credence to the film makers.  This movie is an absolute MUST for any cyber security professional and should really be watched by members of government and military.",1468368000,3,394,5.140625

7781636,2,B01H9HCOP0,"This is just a two-hour version version of interviews and news clips about stuxnet.  There is no dramatization other than one former government employee who is ""interviewed"" during the movie, who turns out to be an actor (disclosed at the end).  If Nova or Frontline did the same piece, it would have been edited down to an hour, and maybe that's what this film needed.

I found it neither entertaining or an interesting 1 hour and 54 minutes.",1468108800,9,443,4.653846153846154

At any time, all it takes is the will to disable a country's infrastructure, and it can be done.  The U.S. is the most vulnerable.

7781640,5,B01H9HCOP0,"This is an absolutely fascinating in-depth account of the technology surrounding US-Israeli development of the Stuxnet worm that infected the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in Iran, and which the Israelis subsequently released worldwide.  It is also a fairly deep philosophical discussion of the implications of global cyberwarfare.  Alex Gibney has done a marvelous job with this brand new documentary.",1467936000,8,407,5.88135593220339
