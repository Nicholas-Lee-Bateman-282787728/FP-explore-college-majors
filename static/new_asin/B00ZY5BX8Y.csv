8721108,4,B00ZY5BX8Y,"The archivists at Vinegar Syndrome known mainly for reviving vintage X-rated films from the Seventies and Eighties have dusted off two rare Horror titles  for fan completists.  First up is 'CRYPT OF THE LIVING DEAD' aka 'YOUNG HANNAH , QUEEN OF THE VAMPIRES' aka' LA TUMBA DE LA ISLA MALDITA'-1973, a Euro/US production with an interesting history.  Started and shot in Turkey with a Spanish film crew directed by Julio Salvador, it was completed in the US by Actor/Director Ray Danton using L.A. locations and retaining some of the actors with extra sequences.  When a noted archaelogist turns up mysteriously dead on the reclusive 'Vampire' island, his son decides to investigate and becomes embroiled with a beautiful 700 year old Vampire queen overseeing a blood cult.  Resembling Vampire 70's cult classics such  as Director Bob Kelljan's 'COUNT YORGA, VAMPIRE' -1970 and Director John Hayes's 'GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE'-1971, it boasts a mixed bag of wonderful atmospherics trapped under slipshod film making.  It has a great cast in actor Andrew Prine , one of the best actors of that period, actor Mark Damon who flip flopped back and forth from Europe (he just completed Director Paolo Solvay's 'THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT' aka 'IL PLENILUNIO DELLE VERGINI'-1973) to the US. , actress Patty Shepard who also played a vampire queen in the Paul Naschy Werewolf saga Director Leon Klimovsky's 'WEREWOLF VERSUS THE VAMPIRE WOMEN' aka  'WEREWOLF'S SHADOW' aka  'LA NOTTE DE WALPURGIS '-1970 but here plays a school teacher and the beautiful Spanish actress Teresa Gimpera as Hannah who appeared in Director Jess Franco's 'COUNT DRACULA'-1970 among others.  You'll also spot Spanish actor Frank Brana and American Edward Walsh who played Count Yorga's valet 'Brudah' in the film mentioned above.  Vinegar Syndrome restores  the film in 2K Blu-Ray from a 35mm negative with nice color and is the best the film has ever looked.  It is ,however, the US cut which trims a bit of the gory shots included in the Spanish version.  The second bonus feature is a rare British Gothic rarely scribed about in Horror film books and round table discussions.  Director Ray Austin's HOUSE OF THE LIVING DEAD' -1974 resembles its distant cousin Director Robert Hartford-Davis's 'THE BLACK TORMENT'-1964 bringing Voodoo practices and Soul entrapment experiments into the Gothic mix.  To reveal the plot would be detrimental to first time viewers but it emerges as the better of the two films boasting great costumes and performances including the beautiful Shirley Anne Field who also graced Director Michael Powell's 'PEEPING TOM '-1960 and Director Joseph Losey's 'THE DAMNED'-1961.  Director Austin who was a stunt man/Director on the British Cult TV series 'THE AVENGERS' and who lensed the wonderfully delirious  'THE VIRGIN  WITCH'-1970  directs with style and flair right up to the films surprise ending.  Vinegar Syndrome releases it in 1080P with the quality ranging from overly bright to overly dark which shows that the original film source was obviously in poor shape but is saved by its clarity and stereo sound.  This release has no extras except for a trailer for 'HANNAH' and footage utilizing the 'CRYPT' title . It also has the same double Feature in DVD format and both are perfect for a midnight film party. It seems to be listed as a limited edition so get your copy while you can.",1444608000,16,3383,5.068592057761733
