No expensive outlay, just a really great method on finding out what we really want and then focusing on how to get there.
Thank you",1344643200,2,234,4.222222222222222

Dina and Mark Beauvais are the creators of the Dream Program (please note: Dina Beauvais wrote the book ""Dream to Destiny"" which is what this DVD is based on. She also has a mentoring program if you should so choose).

Through their own life experiences and dedication to helping others, they have been able to fine tune the steps to creating a life of passion and purpose. It's easy to just sit on this information and not do anything about it, but they show you exactly how to manifest your heart's desires through the inner journey of discovery and then taking action.

They are both so passionate about this work, it's difficult to not want to adopt such positivity into your own life.

These steps are not difficult. You will be amazed at how quickly your life can change with focus. The DVD helps keep you in the zone...and the steps are actually quite fun and life altering. Dina and Mark have lived what they speak and they want you to rejoice in the possibilities of making your dreams come true too.",1330473600,4,1120,4.534653465346534

I've been a strong supporter of the Dream Program for quite some time, and although I try and follow this program daily, I find the Dream to Destiny Workshop DVD and added bonus to the entire program. It keeps me focused and motivated.  Mark and Dina are excellent, dedicated mentors.  I would recommend this DVD and the Dream to Destiny program itself to anyone.  I've sent my own children the DVD Workshop and hope it will make a difference in their lives as it has in mine. Thank you Dina and Mark for caring so much about other people and helping to improve their lives.",1329609600,5,634,4.48695652173913
