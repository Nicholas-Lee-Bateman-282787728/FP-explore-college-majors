8595405,1,B00DOMV1G8,"Many of the titles on these disks are second rate films, which is to be expected in a collection of 20 flicks at this price, so I'm not complaining about that. There are some good, watchable films mixed in. What was more than a little annoying, however, was the fact that many were so grainy and poorly focused that they were impossible to watch for more than a few minutes without getting frustrated enough to click on to the next title.  Particularly the dusk/night segments were annoying.  Half the time you can't see exactly who is doing exactly what. Even the credits were blurry in many instances.  In short, they were a waste of money.  Only 3 of the first disk of 10 were worth trying to watch.  Unfortunately, I bought a bunch of films all at the same time and didn't view these disks until after the return period was expired, or they would have gone back!",1471305600,,866,4.455696202531645

8595408,1,B00DOMV1G8,"The quality of the films aren't good at all. TGG just put two past releases into one package. I gave this one star just for the quality of the films, but the movies are good but hardly watchable from this collection. TGG Direct wasted money on making this and focus on more MGM release double features. Overall this is a product I wouldn't recommend.",1383177600,5,350,4.484375
