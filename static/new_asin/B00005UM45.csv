7954942,2,B00005UM45,The only reason I purchased this DVD was Tammy Parks (aka Bambi Newberry). It is hard to find her DVD appearances but I continue to pursue them. This one was just too brief and she was not a lead character. Maybe worth it if you buy this one for $1 otherwise head to Titanic 2000 for a lot more of Tammy!,1353110400,,304,4.0
