8167848,3,B000MCHF1S,"I give it a 3, not exactly the information I needed. It has good other info on GSD but it really not what I was looking for. Its just basic trainings and I already know how to do that. I only recommend people who have a GSD for the first time.",1387670400,,243,3.784313725490196
8167849,4,B000MCHF1S,"IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IN GOOD CONDITION. I LIKED IT ALOT, BUT WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT HAPPIER IF IT WAS A LOT LONGER AND HAD MORE SECTIONS OR PARTS TO IT. THE WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES. I HAVE OTHER VIDEOS WHERE EACH LITTLE SECTION IS 15 MINUTES ALONE. I WISH IT HAD INCLUDED ABOUT BUYING A GERMAN SHEPERD FROM A SHELTER, SUPPLIES TO BUY, AND HOW TO PREPARE FOR YOUR NEW PET. EVEN THOUGH I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LENGTH, I'M STILL GLAD I BOUGHT IT!!!!!!",1375315200,,474,4.21978021978022
8167850,1,B000MCHF1S,Portly done uninformative and a waste of $ at any price. I wish I could get my $ back! Terrible someone would even try to sell this garbage,1352764800,,139,4.0
8167851,1,B000MCHF1S,"This starts out with a lady who is in such a big hurry fast talker and tells you little to nothing about training, at the end there is a bonus about some training but that's it hardly worth a dollar watch dog whisper your dog will thank you. PS the dogs running around at the end what a joke don't let the joke be on you my friend cause I told you so.",1243900800,11,351,3.8219178082191783
8167852,1,B000MCHF1S,Not worth the money.  The only German Shepherd part is the picture on the cover! the DVD only talks about the history of the German Shepherd then goes into a generic training video.  Title is misleading and not worth the price.  The video is very short and they have included some total garbage about a playdate which is nothing more than a couple of dogs being video taped.  I feel I have been duped!,1184284800,16,401,4.378378378378378
8167853,1,B000MCHF1S,"I bought this same video for Rottweilers and it was identical outside of the dogs in the video, the people talking and the breed history.  VERY generic.  No more informative than an internet search.",1178409600,8,198,4.794117647058823
8167854,5,B000MCHF1S,This is the 2nd DVD we got from this series.  The first was the interactive puppy training and helped us potty-train our new German Shepherd.  Over all they are interesting and informative and gives good detailed information on the breed.  Plan on getting the Dog Tricks next as I see it is a top seller.  The basic obedience worked good with our puppy too.,1175299200,,357,4.53125
