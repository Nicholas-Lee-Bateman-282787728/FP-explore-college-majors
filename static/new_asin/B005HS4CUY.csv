4703328,1,B005HS4CUY,"This is a case of having a great idea but being too lazy to execute it and give the best product worthy of the word ultimate.
- blu-ray discs, check
- dvds, check
- digital codes, check
- toy box, sturdy cardboard box.  It's nice and for the price of the trilogy I won't complain

what I will complain about is the fact that the disc are not in jewel cases or circular plastic cases.  The discs are placed in a piece of black foam.  Nothing really special, just slots in the foam for each and every discs.  You know what this is called?  It's called lazy production value.

don't buy this product, you are better off just buying a combo pack sometime down the line.  The Mediocre Toy Story Collection is not worth your money and is not worthy of these great films",1288656000,251,763,4.25
4703329,1,B005HS4CUY,"I bought this set so I could use the digital copies on my laptops and keep the blu-rays safe for viewing on the TV.  The set did not have activation codes for the digital copies, and so I can not use them.  I tried to use Disney.com help but they have no pictures of what the activation code looks like. Tried the help line but their hours are very limited. I did a search online and found nothing but other people complaining about not getting activation codes with their Disney movies also.
Do Not buy this item unless your just looking for the DVD's and Blu-rays.  In fact from my internet search I would say don't buy any Disney DVD or Blu-ray if your hoping to get a digital copy.
Disney made sure I had my Magic Code to enter my points online but somehow couldn't get the activation codes in there.  Do a search for ""Disney digital copy activation codes,"" and see for yourself.  Once the box is open you won't be able to return it.",1288569600,8,937,4.271186440677966
4703330,5,B005HS4CUY,"I saw the frist movie in theaters when I was 6 years old. I loved it!!!!
Saw number 2 on VHS. like it alot!!! Now something even better and that is
3!!!!! Check it out you all!",1288483200,,176,3.7837837837837838
4703331,4,B005HS4CUY,"No point in selling telling you about the movies themselves. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past couple decades you already know, or seen for yourself, these classics. Each of the three Toy Story films have or will have their own separate Blu-Ray release with a second disk in standard DVD format. So the big question is what else are you getting on this combo pack. Let me give the low down.

For one this trilogy combo pack will essentially be cheaper to get than buying the three movies separately. This is a very good thing for those of you who do not have any Toy Story Blu-Rays as this means you're coming out ahead of the rest of us who bought them separate. Also everybody's favorite talking point on this release is the inclusion of a digital copy for playing on your portables, a feature not included in the separate releases. So is that all the benefits of getting this package? Well you get a cheesy little carrying case that is pictured above, but that's pretty much it.

That's right ladies and gentlemen. No exclusive content. Three disks for each movies (Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital copy) along with a tenth disk that is likely the same supplemental disk that's included in the Toy Story 3 Blu-Ray. If you are looking for a collector's set with never-before seen footage, featurettes, outtakes, alternate endings and whatnot you won't find it here. However if you don't have any of the previous disks you will get a pretty sweet price, and for those moaning about digital copies you will get that too. Oh yeah... and the toy box ""collector's"" case.",1285718400,463,1579,4.615658362989324
4703332,5,B005HS4CUY,"I can not wait to get this set.  Not only does it have the standard DVDs.  But it has all three in Blu Ray and it has three DVDs so you can download digital versions.  Most of the time with digital downloads, you can choose from a download that will play on itunes or a download that will play on Windows Media player.  I am hoping for an itunes version.  That way I can pout it on my Apple TV or my iPod.  There is a DVD with extra stuff for the third movie.

From what I have read, here is what each DVD will have

DVD 1, Toy Story
The first movie Academy Award-Winning Short:Tin Toy, Audio Commentary by the Filmmakers, The Making Of Toy Story, Multi-Language Reel, On-Set Interviews with Buzz & Woody, Toy Story Treats, 5.1 Sound Effects-Only Track, THX Certified - Includes THX Optimode

DVD 2 Toy Story 2
Academy Award-Nominated Short: Luxo Jr., Audio Commentary by the Filmmakers, Outtakes, Monster, Inc. Sneak Peek, 5.1 Sound Effects-Only Track, THX Certified - Includes THX Optimode

DVD 3 Toy Story 3, Introductions by the Filmmakers,, The History Of Toy Story and Toy Story 2, Character Design, Location Design, Story Development, Moviemaking Secrets, Music & Sound Design, Deleted Animation, Abandoned Concepts, Early Tests, Original Treatments, Storyboard Pitch, Storyboard-to-Film Comparisons, Animation, Production Progression Demos, Trailers, TV Commercials, Posters, Guide To Hidden Jokes, Music Videos, Original Song Demos, 3-D Flyaround Tours of Different Sets from the Film

As you can see, the extra DVD is loaded with extra stuff.  It will be exciting to see it all.

All three films are great.  I was really happy with the third movie.  It's rare that a movie has a third version come out that is just as, if not better than the first two.  These are all great movies to watch with your family.
So, get the box set and set dates that you and your family can enjoy watching them together.

Update 2/2/11
I just wanted to let you know how the set is set up.  It comes in a cool box.  When you look on the right there is something you can pull out.  This is the box that the DVDs,Blu ray and digital copys sit in.  It looks like an old wagon.  The kind that was pulled by horses in the old west days.  In it, there is a black foam thing that takes the entire space.  It has slits for each disc to fit in.  They all fit snug.  Does not seem like anyone should have to worry about them falling out.  I kept the wagon in the case sitting on my movie shelf.  But, you could keep the outisde case in another place and just sit the wagon out.  Eaiter one would look neat for collectors.",1285632000,17,2600,4.495726495726496
4703333,1,B005HS4CUY,"I hate to be the guy who rants, I always frown when I read a rant because it feels kinda stupid.
Ok, the point.
When the Blu-Ray releases of the Toy Story 1 & 2 were released earlier this year, it did in fact seem odd to me that there was no Digital Copy placed in the sets as most of other recent Pixas releases did. I still bought the sets, knowing that eventually OF COURSE there would be a trilogy set released with collactables and special features like always.
BUT, to hold back the digital copy, which is almost a given with most blu-rays nowadays, for the special boxset, is just mean.
Ugh.
500 stars for the movies, 1 for their strategies.
I'll still probably buy this set anyway :D",1285632000,21,691,4.282442748091603

This set comes with the Special Edition Blu-Ray versions for the first two, and a 2-disc set for Toy Story 3, with one being the feature, and the other being bonus material. It does not come with DVD copies, which is good. Overall, pick this set up if you liked the Toy Story movies.",1525996800,,570,4.098214285714286

But was it too good to be true? There were several reviews saying the blu rays would not play, and this had me worried. I decided to take a chance. I can honestly say that every single blu ray loaded and played without any problems. I'd also like to add that my blu ray player is almost 10 years old, but there were no issues. The only thing I can think of is that it may have been a little slower to load than I'm used to, but that's reaching to find something negative.

The 3 star rating comes from how they arrived. The barely padded envelope did very little to protect it so the box they sit in was crushed in front and the case for the first movie was so damaged I had to rip it apart to get to the disc then find a new case to put it in since it was in no way safe for a child to be touching.,1496534400,2,470,3.6633663366336635

I ordered these and have not had any problems! The two siblings who are toddlers are stuck on watching Toy Story 3 almost every day lol. I've had no issues with startup or not playing. We play in our Sony DVD/blue ray player. I've not tried in our PS4 so can't say for sure. But for this price you cannot beat it! Thank you. A+,1496275200,5,558,4.3238095238095235

It did however play on my son's brand new Blu ray player we got him for Christmas with no issues. I'm giving this 4 stars because it is great and you CANNOT beat the price.

I wasn't too sure about this specific set since it's from The UK, But the discs are all region and play perfectly in my Sony Blu-ray player.

There are a few more ads (Than the US prints. my friend owns them) for Disney stuff to bypass before you get to the main menu, but that's nothing a few clicks of the remote can't fix.

Compared to the current US releases, there are only 2 differences. 1. The US releases come with digital copy. 2. On these UK discs, the first 2 Toy Story's contain a toy story 3 preview. That was removed from the current US prints with digital copy. Other wise, all of the special features are the same.

And this is how I buy this item. The movies is okay, also the item, but we have a problem. When my buy was arrived and I open succesfully the package, a big question was born in my mind. Only was the ""toybox"" with the movies inside. Where is the paperboard? Like you can see in the main photo, the toybox have a paperboard with the movie characters in relief. This not was in my package. And other little book inside the toybox not was. After it, was wirte to the seller and says to me wich was missed... I also write to Amazon.com about this and says to me that the item would had a bad manipulation... Seriouslly? I was very dissapointed for it, I wanted to have my edition complete... Well, after all, Amazon sent to me a refund of this item. I don't was expected an experience like this.

4704341,4,B005HS4CUY,"Wonderful story - looks great on blu-ray.  However, I recieved the UK import version.  Yes it plays fine but there are a bunch more menu choices I have to make to play it (pick a language among others).  Also this edition contains lots of ads (mostly for the other Toy Story movies) to skip over.  One can't simply pop the disk in and watch (select language, would you like ads with that?, Movie, movie with extra, extras, ugh).  The humor isn't lost on me - kind of like the Spanish version of Buzz Lightyear.  Minus 1 for the frustration just getting to play the actual movie...repeated every time we watch the movie.",1470009600,13,619,4.482142857142857

Given this info the seller didn't have enough compassion to refund my whole amount since I had taken the cheap plastic off and tried a DVD. If I had known they would charge 50 percent restock fee I would've blow dried some plastic on it myself and sent it. That's ridiculous !

This is a great collection for a toy story fan. The only problem I have with this product is how the dvds are presented. They are placed in a diagonal line in a piece of Styrofoam which is placed in the toy chest. There are tiny cuts in the Styrofoam, which is where each disc is placed. Some of the cuts are uneven or cut too close together. I am not a big fan of this design choice. But over all, this set is fantastic.",1467158400,,819,4.1125

4704471,5,B005HS4CUY,"In 1995, Pixar forever changed the face of animation with its release of Toy Story. It was a film that had immeasurable impact on audiences and would be the first in a long strong of successful animated features from the Pixar company.  What makes the Toy Story films so successful is the emphasis on their stories as well as the emotional dynamics between the characters. Now 16 years later, Toy Story is still considered one of the greatest animated film ever made.

Prior to the release of Toy Story 3 to theaters, Pixar decided they would attempt to bring the first two Toy Story films to 3D so that audiences could enjoy them as never before.  The entire process of converting those films to 3D took a total of 10 months, with the first 4 dedicated to bringing the films up to present technology.

TOY STORY 3

It's now ten years later and Andy is getting ready to leave
for college.  Now an adolescent, it's time for him to say
goodbye to his toys: Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Hamm
(John Ratzenberger), Slink (Blake Clark), Rex (Wallace Shawn),
Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Jessie (Joan Cusack).
Will they be desined for the attic or the trash heap?  This
is the conflict that faces our favorite toy-chest friends as
Woody (Tom Hanks) assures them all that they will safely
stored in the attic.  However, a mishap with a garbage bag
leads the group of toys to Sunnyside Daycare where they meet
its caretaker, a cuddly bear named Lots-O'-Huggin' (Ned Beatty),
a new Barbie (Jodie Benson) and her counterpart Ken (Michael
Keaton).  Things take a turn for the worse when Woody discovers
a horrible secret at Sunnyside and must suddenly plan a daring
escape for he and his friends.

As I have been slowly making my way through the trilogy, I have
found myself wonderfully overwhelmed by the quality of the
conversions done for the Toy Story films.  The experience of
watching these films in 3D has been if I had been seeing them for
the very first time with new eyes.  As I have progressed through
each film in the series, I found that the quality of animation and the
magnifying effect that 3D brings to it, increasingly more refined.
With all the accolades I had given to Toy Story and Toy Story 2 for
its stunning metamorphosis, little did I realize that these films were
simply warming me up for the visual experience of watching Toy Story 3.

While nothing surpasses the charm of the original, the sequels have
greatly benefited from the advances in computer animation and the
clarity of high definition.  Certainly, Toy Story 3 is the sharpest of all
the transfers which means there is a level of unsurpassed detail to enjoy.
For example, I immediately noticed more defined texture within the
animation such as the finely detailed strands of Andy's hair. I even
discovered for the first time that Bullseye the horse is made of cloth.
These are perfect examples of how Pixar continues to improve upon
and break new ground with their computer animation.

It seemed when Disney decided not to originally release Toy Story 3
to Blu-ray 3D, the purists were somewhat relieved citing that the
process would only diminish the vibrance of colors. I am very pleased to
say that Toy Story 3  in 3D looks as vibrant and colorful as ever!  You
immediately notice that aspect from the very first moments of the film
where we are plunged into a landscape of beautifully saturated red
rocks set against a piercingly deep blue sky. It's actually quite
breathtaking to take in.  The rest of the film looks extremely well polished
with startling rich black levels (most evident in Potato Head's mustache
and hat) that add just enough needed texture.  There is absolutely no
digital artifacts to be found anywhere. This transfer is picture-perfect!

If you have been following my reviews of this trilogy to date, you
have heard me talk about viewing without borders.  It's the kind of
experience that a great 3D film provides.  Imagine a transfer so purely
flawless and sharply defined that your display becomes a picture window
where action plays within it and one gets the feeling of being able to
reach in and touch its players. It's a world where you quickly forget that
glasses are required.

Toy Story 3 is the first in the film series to actually be imagined
with the format in mind.  For that reason, the depth is more pronounced
and specific object placement such as hanging ceiling decorations
at Sunnyside or a toy mobile set placed over a bed stand out within
their particular scenes.  For those that like their 3D ""tastefully"" done,
you can't do better than this film.  However, those like myself that pay
a premium to watch a 3D film are going to be highly disappointed that
the filmmakers don't take advantage of the process by throwing an
object or two towards the audience.  While I am going to try and refrain
from going into my usual rant about this practice, I will say that it is
becoming more evident that Hollywood is more interested in cashing
in on the phenomenon than making films that really WOW the audience.
And you know what?  Perhaps this is just the wrong film to even attempt
to make an argument about, because really, Toy Story 3 ranks as the
best non-gimmicky 3D title currently available.

The film's 7.1 DTS-HD MA audio downconverted to 5.1 on my
system, provides a spectacular encompassing sonic experience
with exceptional clarity, engaging surround activity and supporting
bass.  There's a more complex mix heard here than in the films
that preceded it, with more emphasis put on the placement of effects
such as kids that scurry across the listening field or the menacing
sound of motors that make up a garbage conveyer belt.  The film's
actions sequences would not seem as climactic if not for the abundance
of bass that supports it.  Whether it be the simple ""thud"" of a slamming
car door or the thunderous boom of a nuclear explosion filled with ""death
by monkeys,"" there is enough bass here to keep the viewer's floor
shaking throughout.

Toy Story 3 arrives in a 5-disc combo pack that includes the
3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, Blu-ray bonus disc, DVD feature and
Digital Copy disc.  All of this is sleeved in cardboard lenticular
packaging.  The 3D Blu-ray contains 3D trailers for Pixar's upcoming
Brave and Planes.  Extra features include ""Day & Night"" theatrical
short, Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: The Science of Adventure, Toy
Story Trivia Dash - Interactive Game, Cine-Explorer with director Lee
Unkrich and Producer Darla Anderson, Bonnie's Playtime - a story
roundtable with director Lee Unkrich, Paths to Pixar: Editorial, three
Studio Stories, and more.

WIth all due respect to the original, Toy Story 3 is the best 3D
experience of the series.  In fact, despite the fact that there is not
a blatant gimmick to be found here, there is more than enough
WOW factor to make this one of the best 3D titles currently available.

I would certainly urge everyone who is considering picking up at
least one of these films on 3D Blu-ray, to purchase them all.  For
each title progressively improves upon its predecessor in providing
exemplary 3D for your display.

Disney needs to be commended for doing such a wonderful job
with all these titles!

TOY STORY 2

As Andy reades for cowboy camp, Woody is kidnapped by
Al McWhiggen (Wayne Knight), the owner of Al's Toy Barn,
who is looking to make millions by selling the doll off to a
museum in Japan.  We learn that Woody is the star of a 1950s
show called Woodys Roundup which also features Jessie, the
Yodeling Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector
(Kelsey Grammer), and Bullseye the horse.  Leave it to Buzz,
Rex, and the other familiar toy-chest characters to set off in
rescuing Woody.

Just having reviewed the new 3D Blu-ray release of the
original Toy Story, I was astounded by how well the conversion
process improved upon the film.  Well, folks, Toy Story 2 makes
that effort look somewhat primitive. You see, everything about
this 3D release of Toy Story 2 trumps the original.  The animation
seems more refined with colors that are richer and more eye-popping
than ever. More prominently than ever is how well the flawless transfer
and depth of 3D work perfectly together to provide a viewing experience
like none other.

It doesn't take long to figure out that there is something quite
remarkable going on here.  From the rolling of the opening credits
that lead to Buzz Lightyear's infiltration of Zurg's fortress, I was
shaking my head in total disbelief as to how incredible the imagery
looked with its added spatiality.  The entire time I was watching this
film I thought to myself, ""You mean to tell me that this film was
not originally conceived for 3D?""

This transfer effectively conveys exactly what I feel 3D should
bring to film....viewing without borders.  By that I mean, you get
the sense that there is no longer a screen or border on your display.
You are looking out a window upon action that is taking place before
you without any boundaries.  You could almost reach out with your
hand and pick up any of the characters playing before you.  I rarely
see this kind of perfection in a transfer that leads one to suspend
all believability that they are simply watching a film.

Action sequences, such as a daring escape down an elevator shaft
look more menacing than ever before.  For example, as the camera
angles upwards at the cables, the perception of depth adds a new
presence of danger that 2D cannot.  Even the film's most memorable
scene where the characters cross a busy highway inside road cones
takes on an entirely new feel thanks to the differentiation of sizing
between the characters, the oncoming traffic, and even the street
light that hovers above the intersection.

I am going to give a single point to the ""In Yo Face"" factor of this film.
It's quite pleasing to find that even though Toy Story 2 was not designed
for 3D, objects like fingers, hands and the noses of Hamm and the doll
doctor manage to just barely poke out beyond the confines of the screen.

And just to put the cherry on this transfer, I am happy to proclaim
that I found absolutely no cross-talk/ghosting anywhere within the transfer.

The film's 5.1 DTS-HD track sports beautiful dynamics that bring
out the smallest nuances in the film's audio.  With a better soundmix
the the original, every effect is clearly defined, well placed and as a
whole, immerses the viewer in the action as effectively as the 3D does.
It was kind of neat hearing the homage given to some of the Star Wars
sound effects including laser blasts. lightsabers and helmet breathing.
Most notable in this mix is the amount of bass, which is bound to knock
a few items off someone's shelving.  You hear it underlying the film's
opening credits, as Buzz Lightyear takes flight, and in scenes with
oncoming traffic and a rolling concrete pipe.

Toy Story 2 arrives as a 4-disc set that includes 3D Blu-ray, 2D
Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy disc that is housed with a lenticular
cardboard sleeve.  The 3D Blu-ray contains 3D trailers for Pixar's
upcoming releases of Planes and Brave.  Extras include Buzz
Lightyear's Mission Logs: International Space Station, three Animated
Studio Stories, Pixar's Zoetrope, Toy Box: Outtakes and Alternate
Scenes, Deleted Scenes and more.

Toy Story 2 is a thing of beauty....a flawless, immaculate transfer so
perfectly enhanced in 3D that one easily forgets that they are actually
watching a film as their display is magically transformed into a picture
window of live animation.  Everyone at Disney who was involved with
the conversion and transfer  have done an incredible job and for that,
""we are eternally grateful!""

TOY STORY

This is the film that started it all, introducing us to young
Andy and his prized western doll Woody (Tom Hanks).
The doll becomes Andy's best friend, that is, until on his
birthday he is given a very special present of a nifty-new
astronaut toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who
immediately steals the heart of the young boy. Our heroes
are joined by an expertly-voiced supporting cast of characters
that include smart-alecky Hamm (John Ratzenberger), a
slinky dog aptly named Slink (Jim Varney), a petrified
dinosaur named Rex (Wallace Shawn), and a caustic Mr.
Potato Head (Don Rickles). When Woody and Buzz suddenly
find themselves lost and in the hands of a vicious neighborly
kid named Sid, they learn to put their differences aside in an
effort to help each other escape and find their way back home.

The transfer, as would be expected, is immaculate.  In
fact, after 16 years, Toy Story looks as new as it did then.
In fact, one could very well say that this transfer stacks up
against the best the Blu-ray format has to offer with a stunningly
beautiful picture, bold and vivid colors, deep black levels and
the finest of detail -- all of which provide seemingly 3D quality
even without the glasses.

So let's talk about Toy Story in 3D.  The skeptics out there
will talk about how studios are simply upconverting their films
to 3D in order to tap a cash cow.  In fact, up until recently, the
process of upconverting 2D to 3D titles has been met with quite
a bit of criticism.  I can actually side with those critics as there
have been a few unconverted live-action films that I have reviewed
that look less than convincing.  That being said, Disney seems to
have struck oil with their attempts to bring 2D favorites into the new
dimensional format. Recent efforts such as The Lion King and
Beauty and the Beast are quite impressive with newly-added realism
that makes one feel they are watching these films fresh for the very
first time.

This is exactly the feeling I had watching Toy Story.  The film has
been opened up to an entirely different level that makes watching
it a totally new experience.  In fact, it's quite amazing to see this
animated masterpiece made even better by its sense of depth between
characters and foreground.  Though the process does create a cut-out
look, it also gives a much more natural feeling of space and realism
that wasn't there before.

Though the film was not conceived for the 3D format, it's amazing
to see just how well the new dimensionality within the animation works.
Take for instance the claw machine at the Pizza Planet.  Looking up from
the pile of toys at the giant claw makes it look more menacing than ever.
A daring rescue in Sid's backyard with toys hiding among the foliage looks
more convincing than ever, as if originally drawn and placed with 3D in mind.
Watch as Woody gives a speech from a Tinkertoy podium at the beginning
of the film and notice the correlation between the sizing of objects.  The
conversion comes off so perfectly that one would never think about watching
this film again in 2D.

Ghosting is not really an issue here.  There is just a hint of crosstalk in
some of the darker indoor scenes, particularly inside of Sid's bedroom.

No surprise that the 5.1 DTS-HD audio track is an amazement within
itself.  And though the film may not sport the same complexities of newer
mixes, the natural dynamics and fine placement of effects make this a
immersive experience.  I was quite pleased with the amount of bass that
is present in this mix, accenting the stomping and roars of Rex as well
as oncoming trucks and other vehicles.

Toy Story arrives in a 4-disc set which includes the 3D Blu-ray, 2D
Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy discs.  The 3D disc includes 3D trailers
for Pixar's upcoming Planes and Brave.  The Blu-ray and DVD contain
extra features that include Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Blast Off, three
Animation Studio Stories, Buzz Takes Manhattan, Deleted Scenes, and
over 90 minutes more bonus.  All of this arrives in a lenticular cardboard
sleeve case.

This is Toy Story like you have never seen it before!  And, really as
far as I am concerned, you haven't really seen this film until you have
witnessed it in 3D.  Disney has done an outstanding job upconverting
old favorites, which should ultimately help convince the naysayers that
there really is something to this format after all.

Trust me, once you see this film in 3D, 2D will just seem inferior.
This is a must-purchase disc for anyone who savors this format as
much as I do.",1453075200,,16197,4.75

Nothing was wrong with Toy Story 1, or Toy Story 2, but when we tried to watch Toy Story 3 we realized quickly that it was the bonus disc for movie 3, not the actual movie. Where's the movie? We weren't even supposed to get a bonus DVD, just the movie discs. I can't send it back because we don't keep movie boxes. When I opened it in March I immediately threw the boxed away and put the discs in our binder. I guess I should have looked closer at the discs.

The only difficulty is the packaging. While it is a great collectible and display piece, it does not hold the disks in a traditional way. The disks slide in and out of molded foam. It is easy to get the edge of 1 disk to slide into the groove of another disk. This could be a problem for wear and tear over time. I will likely buy some inexpensive multi-disk cases to put each volume in. This way I can shelf them along with the rest of my collection.

4704718,5,B005HS4CUY,"This Blu-ray set, like a certain Harry Potter set (see my HP review), seems to come from the UK, but it plays great in the U.S. I watched all three films, no problems whatsoever. Right now, you can't get a package with all three movies in an American release, and the individual films would cost nearly twice the price for this (at the time of this review).
I won't go into details about the movies; they're great, and if you don't know that, than you've been living under a rock. This package is a cardboard slipcover that contains regular plastic cases for each movie, the same type of plastic case you would get if you bought one movie separately. The only way I can tell these come from the UK is because of the ratings on the back (example: rated 'Universal' for all audiences).
With Blu-ray, there is no region code like there is with DVD, so you don't have to worry about whether these will play in your American Blu-Ray player.",1426809600,3,935,4.441860465116279

Its still the same great movies that are sold in USA but at a much cheaper price. If you are looking for the digital copies and both blu ray and dvd combos  you will not get them with this set, but unlike the ""toy box collection set"" each movie comes in its own case.

I went to claim my Disney Movie Rewards, and my codes weren't valid.  Upon further inspection I realized that these are the British versions.  It really isn't a big deal, they still play on US machines, all of the voices are original, and now the voice overs for the previews has a snazzy accent (The previews are for a ""Cinema"" near you, instead of a Theater.).  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I thought I was buying the American version so I could actually use the Disney Movie Rewards.  There are mixed reviews on what this set contains, and my set only came with 4 disks total.  1 for Toy Story, 1 for Toy Story 2, and 2 for Toy Story 3.

A great quality item, sound packaging and the actual box that holds the three movies is of good quality (no dog ears after using twice kind of thing) and the bluray cases are also good quality. Yeah you may wonder why I say that but I have bought boxsets with cheap cases that crack as you open it and boxes that tear easily.

The bluray for each movie is very good; one disc for parts 1 & 2 and then two disc version for part 3. Parts 1 & 2 have the standard special features from the original DVD, the menus are very nice and multi-language options. One thing I would say ... these discs were obviously created after all three movies were released as parts 1 & 2 advertise part 3 (only) in the sneak peaks and I find that just a bit annoying but in the grand overview ... who cares.",1424304000,,903,4.039106145251397

4704801,1,B005HS4CUY,Had to return!!!  The first disc played perfectly fine.  My daughter liked the first one so much she wanted to watch the second movie right away. I put in the second disc and it would not play.  It read as a data disc.  Completely worthless.  Do not waste your time.,1421798400,,266,4.24

4704803,4,B005HS4CUY,"These movies are fantastic- Love Toy Story.  However, the item I received is the UK version but the coding seems to be universal and plays fine in my player. It contains ONLY the BluRay discs, no DVD and no digital copy or digital copy access.  There is also no Disney Movie Rewards code.  There is no collectible anything in this set- it contains the three movies in basic jewel cases in a cardboard sleeve to hold them together.  I was under the impression this included digital access so it isn't as good of a deal as it seemed when I made the purchase.  Though I'm glad to have our Toy Story 1 & 2 DVDs upgraded to BluRay.",1421452800,4,626,4.271186440677966

4704808,1,B005HS4CUY,"As much as my daughter LOVES these movies, there is one problem...the discs STOP PLAYING after several viewings. I saw similar reviews-several of them- which warned of the same problem, but i bought the box set for Christmas because Disney seems dead set on  still charging their customers $20 apiece for movies that have been on video for 20 years, and i thought it would be cheaper to buy these epically-poorly-made blu rays. We have tried to view them on multiple blu ray devices and have had the same problem: Half the time it won't read the disc, the other half of the time it skips halfway through the movie.
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!",1421107200,3,638,4.547826086956522
4704809,5,B005HS4CUY,"Wow. I couldn't have better spent the money on anything else. Our son loves them, and so do we. Very entertaining for adults and kids. Beautiful plots about things everyone can identify with and excellent writing/ voice-acting/animation etc. We have only had these a short while, but have already watched each all the way through at least twice with our son (at his insistent request).

The one thing I will say though, if your picky about your bluray movies, most ppl aren't but I know some are, the bluray boxes it comes in are the same size as a regular dvd box. So this trilogy set is not a space saver compared to other bluray trilogies, its the same size as a dvd trilogy set which for me was a small, unexpected let down but for the price I'm still pleased and would purchase it again.",1420675200,,493,4.092783505154639

4704908,4,B005HS4CUY,"I saw every movie when they came out in theatres, and then multiple times more when each was released for home viewing. 3 was the saddest of the bunch, and I was reluctant to watch it again after my bout of tears at the movies, but since my wife and daughter are going through Disney movies at the moment I decided to hunker down and give them the Blu-ray experience.

What I like about this set is that you get three versions of the trilogy. You have Blu-ray discs, DVDs, and digital copies. The extras are the same from what I've seen. I can't remember if I've seen them from home releases or other venues, but there's nothing new for me.

The video output is fantastic. My daughter loves the films, and I was enjoying watching them on the newer format. It was like watching them in the theaters.

The packaging is fine, but they could've done it better. I get why they wanted to go with the toy chest, but it's a waste of space. Whereas other movie sets come packed with goodies that justify the heft, the Toy Story Toy Box Collection comes with just the discs. The rest of the toy chest is foam that's used to protect the discs. They could've cut the packaging in half and it would've been fine.",1410134400,,1199,4.32

Seeing them in Blu-ray allows you to see how the technology changed over the decades. I haven't looked at all the extras, but some of the stories and interviews are interesting, and seeing some of the early artwork is fascinating. An early idea of Jessie had her looking more like a California girl blonde!

HOWEVER! USA Disney Movie Rewards members BE WARNED! The Magic Code included with the box is for the UK Movie Rewards site. It will not work at disneymovierewards.go.com. It will only work with disneymovierewards.co.uk. As in United Kingdom. I am in USA. Super duper bummed I won't be rewarded for purchasing 3 blue rays.

One problem I had was the box was a little bent in on the corners and on one corner of each blu-ray box they were cracked just a tad. Myself, I did not mind as much but my boyfriend (being very observational on quality of the packaging of his blu-rays) was a little upset. I believe this is because of the long haul it took overseas to get here along with that it wasn't shipped in a box that would've protected it, rather it was in a simple bag with some bubble wrap on the inside.

All in all the price is SO worth it at this point. Buying the Toy Storys individually would have costed about $50 more than buying them all together.",1404691200,6,828,4.234177215189874

I really LOVED these movies and I'm glad I finally added them to my collection. I love Pixar and there isn't a Pixar movie that I don't love. But for some reason, I knew of Toy Story, but I felt no motivation to watch any of them. My nephews had to really convince me to watch.

That being said the set arrived just fine in attractive looking packaging which seemed to be of decent quality not hard to remove or replace the items....

The set says ""Blu-Ray"" and came with Blu-Ray disks, picture sound and overall quality are true to Disney

I wish that all three came with ""bonus material"" only one disk has it (toy story 3) however....I paid about half the cost I would have if I had bought all of them separately

4704990,5,B005HS4CUY,"It's not hard to see the technical advance from the first Toy Story to the last.  Viewed in purely technical terms, the animation of TS1 is stone-aged when compared to the last.  But that simply doesn't matter: it's every bit as good as it was when it hit the screens almost twenty years ago.

This is a continuing story about family.  It's an odd thrown-together family--a loyal dad and a crazy uncle who thinks he's a spaceman--but it's a family that finds its strength in trust and togetherness.  The story is polished until it glistens and the voice acting is unparalleled.  These three movies reach the kid and the parent in all of us.  Pixar has given us many fine movies, but if they'd only done Toy Story it would have been enough.",1395187200,,739,4.511278195488722

I couldn't believe they sold all three 3D versions of each Toy Story movie in one package.

I was okay with that.. so i went to play it & got a message that said something like check regional compatibility. I have an LG blu-ray player. After a phone call to LG they said the movie wasn't made for dvd players in the US..what! So I tried in my other regular dvd players & also the same message came up. I was skeptical bc it was half price & i thought I was getting a bargain. I purchased it on Amazon through North to South. Very disappointing. I won't be buying movies through amazon anymore. I did find it on Walmart.com. So I am in the returning process right now.

The quality difference between the two is huge, and it feels as if the seller is trying to take advantage of consumers who may not realize they received an inferior product. Maybe it was an honest mistake, but given the packaging, that wasn't my impression.

The quality of the box itself was fine; not over the top nice, but it didn't feel like it was going to fall apart anytime soon.

I contacted Amazon customer service, and I'm on my way to drop this off to be returned for a full refund.

Buyers beware: make sure you're getting what you ordered!",1389744000,9,787,4.489510489510489

If you walk into any retail store just for the original Toy Story, you are going to be spending at least $24.99. This is crazy because I don't want the DVD and digital copy of the movie, I just want the blu ray disc. You are receiving all three Toy Stories for basically $12 dollars a piece! You really can't beat that price, plus the quality of each movie is amazing in 1080p. Definitely worth the purchase if you are at all interested in animated films.",1389139200,,538,4.39

Amazon's listing does convey this is an IMPORT, but the description does not re-enforce this, and it should.  If you're looking for special features, etc, don't look here. Three copies of the movies. Since this is an import, the back of the box has Disney's site as disney.com.uk., but it plays fine in the USA, and looks great, and is a lot less then the $75 you'd have tied  up in buying the movies separately.",1389139200,2,535,4.552083333333333

4705085,5,B005HS4CUY,"For some reason, Amazon seems to have blended the reviews for the deluxe ""Toy Box"" collection, the 3D trilogy, and what I'll refer to as the ""standard"" set - aka the ""Toy Story 1-3 Box Set [Blu-ray]""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-1-3-Box-Set-Blu-ray/dp/B0042FZOFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 1-3 Box Set [Blu-ray</a>].

As a result, many of the 'most helpful' reviews for all three sets mention the poor packaging of the Toy Box edition - namely the use of a foam housing rather than individual cases.

But fear not! I am here to reassure you that unlike the Toy Box collection, the packaging for the standard Blu-ray box set is actually quite nice. All three movies have their own plastic Blu-ray cases, and arrive housed within a barebones, yet functional plastic 'sleeve' (the same shown in the product image). I plan to add some pictures of the packaging, in case anyone might benefit from it. In all, it's a great set that is far better packaged than the reviews might direct you to believe.",1376092800,315,1060,5.341317365269461

All three are just great, quality movies.  I have to say, though.  Buying it on Amazon left me wondering what I was going to get.  They lump the reviews of all of the Toy Story movies.  So just to let everyone know, this particular package is NOT 3D, but just Blu Ray.  I figured that was the case based on the price, so I went for it, but I wanted to let everyone else know as well.",1376006400,,524,3.9238095238095236

That being said, please be aware that you are buying the UK version of this trilogy pack, which has been imported here and resold. I was not 100% clear on that so when these discs arrived with clear UK markings (ratings, disney.co.uk web addresses, etc.) I was not sure if they'd work in my American PS3. Luckily, as they advertise, these are region free and will work.

So to summarize, if you just want the Blu-Rays of these movies, with the applicable special features, minus extra discs, this is the set to buy. Just be aware that it is not a set that is technically supposed to be available in the US.",1372377600,11,1021,4.543478260869565

Toy Story 3 is a tears of joy producing humerous story continuing the saga of Woody and pals.  The underlying human story is full of pathos and some wistfulness, while the story of the toys is full of adventure and some pretty inventive fun and laughs!  TS3 is a must see and you might as well see it in 3D and get the first two installments in 3D at the same time.

One caveat: this version contains ONLY the 3D versions, so if yu have non-3D screens you wish to watch it on, it will not satisfy your needs. As a supplement to the 2D versions, however, it sparkles!",1362528000,7,742,4.2785714285714285

So it was to my surprise when my son recently stayed home from school with a cold that I found him watching Toy Story again more than 10 years later. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, ""What a great, classic movie, Dad....Let's watch Toy Story 2!"" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)

I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. And it turns out that Toy Story 3 is just as classic as the first two. Not only do these movies deserve just a viewing, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. I even had to buy the standard DVDs, because my kids insisted that they need to be able to watch the movies several times...but ""upstairs"" where I don't have a Blu Ray player set up. No problem. I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had and have renewed with these movies, but I say that all three Toy Story movies truly are collectors' items.

Even after having viewed these movies multiple times since their original releases, every time we watch we're all laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.

The first is about Andy's toys and what happens when Andy (6 - 8 years old?) introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy-torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you. Finally in Toy Story 3 Andy is all grown up and the toys have to deal with wondering if Andy will take them to college (a bad bet), keep them in his room (probably not) or....Donate them or....Throw them out in the trash?!?

Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are once again magic together in Toy Story 3 and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).

And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz Lightyear Disney Channel spinoff but not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.

So grab this collection and watch them in chronological order if you haven't already...it really puts things in perspective to watch them chronologically. Either way, get it into your cart then enjoy...with or without some kids!",1352160000,,3052,4.334500875656743

The quality of these blu-rays is flawless in every aspect.  Its great that the set also comes with the dvds and digital copies.
I do have to agree,however, that the packaging is a bit of an oversight.  Having to grab each disc by the edge is a pain since there is no way to do so without smudging them with finger prints.  It happens no matter how careful you are.
That is the only complaint I have with the product though.  I am still happy with my purchase and it was worth it to me.  I would really only recommend this to those who don't have the movies already on blu-ray.",1334102400,,778,4.078947368421052

This was all I wanted just the feature movies. I also bought the set because it is much cheaper than buying the American versions of each movie. Each is at the low-end of $20-$25 each for the first two. The third movie is upwards of $30. Too much for me to buy individually so I bought this.

This set comes with 4 blu rays. Toy Story 1 has 1 disc that is the main movie and some special features. Toy Story 2 has 1 disc and some special features. And Toy Story 3 has 2 discs one disc is the main movie and some special features and the 2nd disc is bonus materials. This disc is as well a blu ray.

The set is well packaged with 3 blu ray cases. This set is region free so it will play on American blu ray players. The movies are crisp and clear and bright. Would buy from this seller agian.",1329955200,292,970,3.9948453608247423

4705233,4,B005HS4CUY,"There's no real point in telling you about the movies themselves. Each are special in their own right, and the blu ray quality is really, really impressive. As I type this, I'm watching the first one, and the PQ is just great. It's a 17 year old movie that looks like it could have been released this year. Just fantastic. I love that my newborn gets to experience them with me. It's probably my favorite trilogy.

As to the packaging, I absolutely get the frustrations that others have. I original bought it because of the price discount I received using some of my Best Buy Reward Points, and when I saw it, thought it was worth it (looking back, it would have probably been around the same price to buy each movie individually, though). It's a cool little treasure box, but once you are days removed from owning it, it does become cumbersome. It's bulky, hard to store, and what I've learned is that I actually forget I own it when it's so easy to grab another blu ray package and simply remove the movie you want.

I reordered the way the discs are organized inside the box; first the blu rays, then the DVDs, and then the digital copies. The original order would have caused me to waste two minutes just looking for the disc I wanted.

I've even considered looking on eBay for each individual case for the movies. The fact that anyone is willing to pay additional money for cases should tell you something.

Do I regret the purchase? No, not really. I still own the movies, and I'm glad I do. Do I wish I would have just gotten the individual movies with cases? I have to say that I do. I got caught up in the nostalgia of having the treasure chest from the movies.

Since I do own the treasure box, I'll put it to good use by putting it in my baby's room for looks, but if you have the choice between this and another, more convenient option, go that route.",1328832000,,1863,4.341954022988506

Now that we've established that, go buy the movies individually.  I can't even begin to describe how bad the packaging is.  The packaging is hard to store, hard to get movies out of, and hard to put them in.  It's just 10 slots cut into some foam, so you don't know what disk is what without handling them all.  They are a pain to put back into the case because of the way the foam is cut.  And, to those that want to keep your disks in good condition for years of watching pleasure, you can't remove the disks without handling the face of them, so they will wind up with all sorts of fingerprints and skin oil on them.

I have many trilogies, collections, and sets of movies, on Blu-Ray and on DVD.  This is hands-down, by far, the worst packaging of them all.",1327363200,,907,4.288235294117647

They still hold up after several years, and the new 3D versions are breathing life back into the first two in the trilogy. I think my favorite will always be TS 2, but they are all great and if you can get all three brand new for under $60 shipped like I did, then jump on it!

We have a full 3D setup with a 51"" Samsung 3D-TV, a Samsung Blu-ray HD, 3D DVD player and the 3D glasses that came with this set. We had excellent viewing of other 3D DVDs that we had purchased, but not this time.

All three DVDs have flaws as they stop/ repeat the scenes frequently. It is quite annoying, as we have to use a ""work around"" to continue viewing!! We don't have the receipt for the purchase we made directly from Amazon, and it has been a chore finding someone at Amazon to talk to about this problem, and perhaps a solution for it.

The ""work around"" we found is to use the ""Forward"" button when the hiccups happen. This would make the DVD go beyond the hiccup points, but the interruptions are still annoying and a turnoff. She has managed to view all 3 DVDs using this work around. But, it is a cumbersome solution for a 6-year old!!

4705262,5,B005HS4CUY,"To begin this review off, I want to refer to all the other posts that are bashing amazon for ""false advertising.""

In the product details section, it says you will only receive 3 discs in this set. Each disc is a Bluray/Bluray 3d which means that you get two discs in one basically. If you read all of the fine print I'm surprised you skipped over that. You would've realized you were only receiving three discs - one for each movie.

Aside from that, I purchased the other three movies in blu ray combos very cheap on the internet. About ten dollars for each to be precise. Each of the Bluray 3D combos are overpriced at a whopping $40! $120 for all three movies?! That's insane! If you want to get the 3D Experience and still have other discs to pop into other players, I recommend buying this and then some of the cheap, original blu ray combos on eBay that are little to nothing.

You'll save yourself a lot of money.
In total I spent around $90 for all three movie sets including this wonderful 3D bundle amazon has.
$90 is better than $120 dollars.
For anybody who thinks they would've gotten a better deal just buying all three combo packs at $40 dollars a pop... you're crazy!
Save yourself some money and buy this!

As a side note: I will tell you that the 3d video quality for all three movies is superb and the audio is great as well. I've now seen the first and second Toy Story's like never before.",1320451200,25,1411,4.333333333333333

Lastly, the region-coding: the movie DVDs are coded for the US, and while the Toy Story 1 and 2 Blu-Rays are encoded for all three regions, Toy Story 3 is Region A only.

The negatives- As many reviewers have already said, the packaging is terrible, I had to buy jewel cases to store the movies in.

4705282,4,B005HS4CUY,"This is just a quick review but I had to say that although the image quality of the movies is great (Toy Story 3 looks fantastic) the packaging, frankly, left a lot to be desired. It's a good idea - to have it literally as a toy box - however it was badly designed for the following reasons:

1) The lid of the ""box"" is kinda flimsy. My 4 year old loves the Toy Story movies and he wants to pick up the box and look at it, but I feel like a bad daddy because I'm afraid he'll break that lid. It's just card and the whole thing hangs together like a cheaply produced paperback.

2) There's no insert to describe what's on each disc. Big omission, imho

3) All the discs stand vertically in foam padding that has been specifically designed to allow the discs to slot in and out. Major problem here - you can't get the discs out easily and it's impossible without putting your fingers on the non-printed side of the disc (ie, the side that actually gets read by the player). I can see some playback issues here... some slim cases, slotted into the toy box, would have worked much better... but I guess it's cheaper this way.

4) The codes for the digital copies are in an envelope... stuck to the inside of the box. I can't type what I thought when I saw this because then my review would be rejected. What idiot thought that would be a good idea? You either have to rip the envelope out or very very carefully try to gingerly remove the inserts from the envelope if you don't want to rip anything.

So... five stars for the movies, three stars for the packaging, averaging out at four stars in all. Pixar is amazing - it's a pity the marketing idiots at Disney are not.",1297036800,6,1667,4.229559748427673

The box itself is pretty flimsy and the ""discs in a foam block"" makes finding the disc you're looking for a total pain in the ""you-know-what."" The one and only benefit to buying this set over purchasing the movies separately is that you can get digital copies for the first two films, which weren't (and still aren't, I believe) available when they were originally released on blu-ray.

That said, the blu-ray transfers are simply stunning. I honestly think that Toy Story 3 looked better on my home theater setup than it did when it saw it in the theater (and that was even with the added benefit of 3D!)

As for the movies themselves, I can't add anything more than what other fans of the series have already said. I vacillate constantly on which of the three is the ""better"" movie and have finally come to the decision that it's simply ""too close to call.""",1293667200,,974,4.528409090909091

As others have stated, they do not come in individual cases or even slip cases, they are just positioned in a foam block. It is really difficult for my son to properly put them away himself, so I am worried that over time they will get left out and scratched.

Be aware that if you want to keep them well protected, you will want to purchase jewel cases or at least sleeves separately. The foam block CAN be removed and the discs stored in jewel cases inside the toy box, which is what I'm guessing we'll end up doing.

Can't complain about the price though, and it only took me about 5 minutes to get all the digital copies loaded into iTunes and onto the ipod, which is great.",1293408000,,845,4.3081761006289305

I only had TS1 and 2 on video before, so it was definitely a worthwhile purchase as I hadn't seen any special features etc. Also good for me since most blu-rays are way overpriced in Australia. There is a trilogy available at JB hi-fi in Australia (all 3 movies on blu-ray for $55 I think), but if you're after the DVD copies as well, this is probably the way to go. On that note, the NTSC region 1 DVDs work fine on my DVD player from Australia (not my old computer drive though) and the blu-rays work fine in my region B player. I could just have been fortunate though.

The kids definitely love the packaging, which looks pretty groovy. Just make sure you take care when handling the discs because they aren't really well protected. (wasn't a deal breaker for me, though some really loathe this packaging apparently)

So pretty much, the main advantage is that you get all 3 movies (3 different copies of each) pretty cheap in a cool looking box set.

I wanted my two boys, ages 1 and 3 to be able to have this media experience for their childhood, so I'm expecting to receive something substantial to weather the years. The collectible toy box provided for disc storage was the ultimate...joke?!#!!

What a disappointment to open this up and discover 10 discs sitting in a foam cutout, all encased by a flimsy, laminated, waxy shaped toybox, which slides into the paper presentation box to be proudly stored on your shelf for the millenia...or next week, until one of the rugrats decides to take matters into their own hands and opens it themselves. That will be the end of the ""collectible"". I suppose Pixar's definition of collectible is, "" for adults only"".

4705330,4,B005HS4CUY,"It took a lot of patience on my part but here we are. I waited for these films to come in one package. Not buying the DVD versions. Waited when the third film came out in theaters and Disney released the previous two on Blu-Ray in separate packs. Waited, despite the begging from my wife and daughter to get the films already. But I held out... And now THEY ARE MINE! (Insert evil laughter here.)

So is it everything I had hoped for? Well, I have to say yes. Here is my take on it.

The set comes in a beautiful box that is as colorful as the films themselves. Open it reveals a mini version of Andy's toy box and opening that reveals the discs, held in place by pre-formed foam. The toy box itself is adorable and I don't mind the lack of jewel cases. The only problem is that the slots where the discs slid into are delicate and continuous use will probably wear them out. Plus its very easy to confuse the slots and place the discs in the wrong slot. Aside from that, the presentation looks awesome in my opinion. Some better execution would have made it better. The box now sits proudly at the top of my movie collection.

The collection has 10 discs. A BD version of the films, a DVD version and a Digital Copy version, which is pretty much par for the course for a Disney release. The DVD versions will of course have permanent play on our mini-van. The tenth disc is the Bonus Features of the stand alone release of the third film. Many have cried foul over this fact as many were hoping the tenth disc was going to be unique for this release but alas, it was not to be. For me, there are two possible explanations: 1) Disney simply tried to homogenize the release. the other two films have their respective previous special features. The third film is the only one of the three released in the Blu-Ray era so to be faithful, they threw that in. 2) In an effort two make us double dip, they held out any new extra content for a future inevitable anniversary edition of this collection. The reaction to this is completely understandable I think, considering just how good the extras on Pixar films have been but here is the reason it doesn't bother me one bit:

The transfers to BD of all three films is SO good, I forget everything else.

As it turns out, my patience was rewarded twice. In my stubbornness to wait out this collection I found myself asking my brother to lend me his DVD versions of Toy Story 1 & 2 1 week before this box came out hoping to calm my daughter's desperation as she simply loves these films. This gave me the opportunity to make a side by side comparison and I have to tell you. These transfers are impressive. Most impressive. The BD editions simply blow any previous releases out of the water. Those familiar with Pixar Blu-Rays will find no surprises in that last comment but since Toy Story is the first (and therefore oldest) film n the Pixar canon, I wondered how it would turn out but I should not have worried. Watching these films on Blu makes watching the DVD versions look like trying to watch a movie screen through a screen door. You have not watched these films until you watch them on Blu-Ray. Even if you saw them in theaters. They are that good.

So, is it worth it? For me, absolutely. Since I don't own a previous version of any of the films included here, this collection is downright perfect. However, owners of previous editions who might be looking for more can be(and have been) dissapointed.  So despite the little flaws in the packaging I give it a solid 4 stars. The digital transfers alone are worth the price of admission and besides, buying all three films separately costs pretty much the same anyway. Highly recommended.",1290124800,4,3689,4.408223201174743
4705331,3,B005HS4CUY,"I was also so excited to get all three in a gift set.  However, when I received, it was a cheap looking cardboard box holding the dvds.  It would have been a much better collector's item if the box was at least tin.",1289952000,,215,3.9767441860465116
4705332,4,B005HS4CUY,"Here was something odd when I read the reviews of 1 star ratings - no exclusive content from Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray Special Editions. I received my package today and check on the content and what I found out - all that was originally released for the Special Editions of Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray are all there. I am not sure if the comparison was the older DVD Ultimate Edition versions of Toy Story but for the Blu-Ray editions, its all featured.

The packaging is quite nice - cheap cardboard I doubt it. Of course, if handle with care it is durable. Still, while the placement of the disc I felt its best if its in a casing, the foam that holds all ten-disc is something I would rather avoid. The box is rather big and the extra stuff which was stuck on the box is rather annoying.

If you love Toy Story series and for those that have yet to own the previous DVD or Blu-Ray editions, this is worth forking out to own this edition.",1289865600,,934,4.154696132596685
4705333,3,B005HS4CUY,"Awesome movies? Check.

4705334,3,B005HS4CUY,"Most reviewers have gone on and on about the bad packaging. But honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about. The foam takes perfect care of the discs. A box set like this isn't for children, it's for serious film lovers and collectors. I happen to have children and have no problem putting the most often used discs in a slimline case for the kids. A big cube of slimlines is super cheap online and it is ultimately temporary. It would be way worse if the discs got loose and bounced around the box during shipping, moving etc. the way I've seen other cheap box sets do. My only complaint about the packaging is it's so much bigger than it needs to be. The reason CDs, DVDs and other disc-based formats were great to begin with is that they can take up *less* space on the shelf and waste less cardboard, plastic what have you. To be honest I really don't care about fancy packaging and it should be as small and economical as possible (both in shelf space and the afore-mentioned resources) because what's most important is the *content*.

Which brings me to my main point. I had the original Toy Box on DVD but I wanted to upgrade all my Pixar films to Bluray. Unfortunately for me, I didn't fully read all the reviews before going out and purchasing this box. The original Toy Box had awesome bonus materials and I assumed that since Pixar has always put out such great releases that this new ultimate Toy Box would include all of the original material plus anything new they've whipped up for 1 and 2 plus all the new stuff for 3. Not so with this one and that was the biggest disappointment for me. Had I researched more diligently before I would have just bought TS3 on Bluray and been done with it until a future release contained everything.

Having said all that, at the current Amazon prices, it is a good bargain for anyone looking to get all 3 movies in one whack. I had a gift card to BB and in store it was $80 which is totally not worth it but Amazon's $60 is very good. Hence the 3 stars. The movies are spectacular, they were made for Bluray. This set has all of them for those that have none. But minus 2 stars for not making it a true Ultimate Toy Box for us geeks by not including all the past material. I'm ultimately at peace with my purchase as it was my own fault for not researching more fully, I just hope this review better informs the next person in the same situation.",1289692800,3,2402,4.300220750551876
4705335,5,B005HS4CUY,"This is an awesome set, including all 3 Toy Story movies on dvd and blu-ray--what a deal! I know some are complaining about the packaging, but we love the toy box set.

I actually like the foam slot storage system--much easier than the jewel cases and a really cute display in the toy box too. We're very glad to have the set at the 64.99 price.",1289606400,,465,4.235955056179775
4705336,5,B005HS4CUY,"I think the trilogy is the best way to go!  If you don't already have TS1 and TS2 on Blu-ray, then this perfect since TS3 was recently released on BLURAY/DVD/DIGITAL.  We give our daugther the DVD version for her to keep in her collection, we keep the B-R in the family collection and download the digital to the family computer so we can upload to electronic devices anytime.  If your child is like mine, chances are they'll scratch the DVD or misplace it.  This way, you always have the two backup copies, and B-R is just wonderful on your big HDTV as a family movie night choice.

I think the movies are well known enough, so we don't have to tell you how cute the characters are and how heartwarming the little story lines are.

4705337,3,B005HS4CUY,"The Toy Story trilogy is amazing, as most would suspect. However the 3-star rating given to this product is NOT because of the movies, it is for the sub-par packaging they come in. For such a lucrative franchise I expected much more. The ""toy box"" design is certainly cool, keeping with the theme of Toy Story, but the disks sit inside a styrofoam container with little room to grab each disk. The flimsy quality of the actual toy box could be an issue in the making as I am not certain it will last that long. I wouldn't recommend leaving this for little ones to play with or use, in stead take out the disks and place them in slim jewel cases or possibly buy the 3-disk trilogy instead.",1289088000,113,688,4.341085271317829
4705338,2,B005HS4CUY,"I must say that I am disappointed at Disney for releasing a product in this manner.  Here is a breakdown of the rating:

Movie - *****

Packaging - *
There are two primary groups this set appeals to, in my opinion:
Collectors ...
... but this is extremely impractical from the storage standpoint.  The packaging takes approximately 4 times the storage space of 3 combo packs of this movie on a library shelf.  The missing bonus materials content from The Ultimate Toy Box DVD set makes it even more difficult to justify the amount of space it takes up.

Parents ...
... that want all three movies playable on DVD, Bluray, or Digital Format.  Since there are no real content frills added to the normal combo pack set of discs, the scenario that some parents prefer to have ""one packaging"" for all three movies instead of three separate media packs for frequent playback should be considered.  On that end, the cheap cardboard packaging will not suffice.  It not only will fall apart over a short period of time, but the way the discs are inserted lends themselves to be easily smudged and scratched by the young.

Content of the Set - ***
The content of the set did not include the previous Toy Story Ultimate Box Set DVD features, which is extremely disappoint given that I intended to replace the DVD box set with this but now I have to reconsider.  You can find out what is missing by reading the reviews on that set.  If it wasn't for the inclusion of the 2 digital copies of the first two Toy Stories, I would have rated it 2 stars.

Conclusion:
Buy it if you do not have kids handling the discs themselves and you do not already own The Ultimate Box Set from the previous release and don't care about the extra materials.

For those that have The Ultimate Box set, I would recommend simply buying the Blu-ray versions of Toy Story 3 for now and wait for the 3D version and perhaps then, Disney will come to its senses and release all three films in an all-inclusive ""Toy Box"" with EVERYTHING. (We can only hope.)

Since this review is more specifically about this ""set,"" I have given more weight to it than the actual movies themselves.",1289088000,6,2141,4.496124031007752
4705339,4,B005HS4CUY,"Yep, the foam packaging is lazy and leaves much to be desired, and the greatest animated film trilogy ever deserves much better treatment than this.  However, the pricing on the 10-disc set is unbeatable, and there seems to be two ways of solving the packaging ""issue."" The easy choice is to buy the three films separately in the combo packs, which currently run about ten dollars more than this ""complete"" set, yet lack the digital copies on the first two films, but have correctly sized cases. The other, slightly more complicated choice for the video purist is to simply buy a 10-disc replacement DVD case (they do in fact exist in this configuration, and there is at least one online site that will sell just one case) or any combination of the single/dual/multiple replacement DVD/blu-ray cases for the 10 discs. Removing the foam and inner cardboard liner frees up space for the replacement case/s in the toy box, as well as for the earlier DVD versions of TS and TS2. These films are worth the extra effort, and deserve a place in every animation buff's library (minus the non-recyclable foam, of course.)  ;D",1289001600,,1116,4.77720207253886

The packaging is an absolute injustice for a trilogy of this caliber.  Given the quality of all three movies and their popularity, I expected the royal treatment with this box set.  What we get instead is cheap black foam that I can already see is leaving a fine residue on the discs as I remove/insert the discs.  It is difficult to find the disc that you want to see, since the discs are packaged close together in line -- In order to find a particular disc, you need to remove several until you find the one you want.  Also, there is no way to take the discs out or reinsert them without feeling like you will eventually damage them.

But after doing the math in my head of the money I had planned to spend on the Blu Ray editions of those this was an easy choice. I had contemplated doing the Disney DVD to Blu for the other two movies but even at 8 dollar off coupons the price still well exceeded the box set. Although one negative that I was unsure of going in was the Digital Copy of the films. It doesnt say it on the box packaging but they are included as well. Over all this like X-Men, and Spiderman trilogys are amazing because they give you all 3 versions of the film. I have a copy for the road for my daughters portable DVD player and her toy room, and blu ray for the living room. And the digital copy for my ipod's. Awesome value if you don't have any of the on blue ray this is the best value.

Yes they do come in a cheap cardboard box without cases, but that is why they are at a great price! I can't believe people are still complaining and giving this set a low rating when in reality it is a great deal! I don't use the cases to store my DVDs or CDs because it creates too much clutter.  Instead, I store them in a CD book.  They are more portable this way and easier to find.  I love this set, great price! Besides, you shouldn't rate this item on its packaging alone, the movies are what you should be rating and not to mention the price.

is here but open it up and there's a foam sheet with slats cut 1 for each disc.

As someone who also owns the dvd ultimate toy box which only has 1 and 2 + a disc of extras the bd set package wise is more like an ultimate letdown.

Disney should've put both toy story 1 and 2 in bd packaging with the bd,dvd and digital copy a 3 disc set for 1 and 2 while toy story 3 would be a 4 disc set in bd packaging and like the first and ONLY QUALITY SET it would also have a high quality
slipcover with real cases inside.

Disney should be ashamed as kids will destroy the wagon in seconds if it doesn't fall apart before your eyes-yes it's that cheap leaving you 10 bare discs with no real cases to call home...getting everything in 1 box set should be great but disney let us all down especially the kids.

However, I want to know, what gives?!? These are children's movies, and they don't give better protection than the discs sitting in foam in a cardboard box? No individual protection, so this set will have to stay out of my child's reach, or I know I'll find an assortment of discs lying around my living room floor. The foam appears to have been made quite lazily, as a couple of the discs don't even sit right. It would've also been nicer if they had either labelled the area where each disc goes or staggered them differently. With the small spacing between discs, it's difficult to select a disc without smudging the others around it, at least if you have fat fingers like yours truly. Also, for an ""ultimate"" edition, there appears to be a severe lack of special features discs. I guess this is why the price dropped several times before release? I'm pretty sure this is the worst Pixar product I've seen...",1288742400,51,1075,4.546391752577319
4705352,3,B005HS4CUY,"The films are indeed classics and are wonderful examples of innovation, warmth, and fantastic storytelling.  The bonus features are plentiful and detailed providing fans with hours to enjoy.  To top it all off, every possible Toy Story related home viewing option is presented.  It's all here.

However...

The packaging is a serious let down.  The outside of it looks decent enough, but the discs are housed in a black foam.  There are no individual cases for each set or disc.  What this means is that you need to be extra careful to not scratch or smudge the discs, and organizing them is a slight chore.  Spending an extra 5 bucks on behalf of the manufacturer per toy box for decent ways to house some of animations all time classics seems like it would have been a worthwhile investment.

On the upside, if you stick with the box set, it's the only way to get digital copies of the first two films - a bonus for some consumers and an unnecessary addition for others.  Also, each film has a bluray and dvd counterpart so regardless of the means of watching the films, you will have every option available to you should you desire.  In terms of value, you may end up spending less getting the box set if you don't presently own all 3 films.

If the packaging were more secure, this would be a no brainer.  As is, it is underwhelming in spite of the addition of digital copies to the first 2 films.  At least you'll be able to watch any of the 3 films in nearly every format presently available.  It would just be nice to know that the discs themselves would be able to avoid scratching based on how they are kept.",1288656000,2,1617,4.430508474576271
4705353,1,B005HS4CUY,"As a HUGE Pixar fan I pre-ordered this trilogy box set as soon as I heard of it's existence. Upon arrival though, it's extremely underwhelming. The discs are held together in cheap black foam inside the ""Collector's Tox Box"" (which isn't impressive at all BTW). There's no individual case, nor jewel case for any of the discs, they just sit in foam. Literally.

Also, no bonus content that's exclusive to the box set versus the 3 Blu-ray editions separately. That fact is what really finalizes my opinion on disliking this.

I'm so torn. I want to purchase the Toy Story 3 standalone blu-ray, but I want to hold out even more for a ""15th anniversary trilogy boxset"" super edition that does this closing trilogy some justice for a proper retail release.
