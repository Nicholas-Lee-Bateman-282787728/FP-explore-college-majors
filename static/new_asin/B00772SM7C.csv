5059248,4,B00772SM7C,"In ""Gianni e le donne"" (""The Salt of Life"") from 2011 and directed by Gianni di Gregorio, we have a bittersweet tale in the life of an aging retiree who thinks he's lost his spark to attract the opposite sex. 'Gianni' (Gianni di Gregorio) is an easy-going and very mild-tempered 60 year-old who lives with his wife (whom he respects, but is obviously no longer intimate with), his daughter (she's always asking him for advise with her relationship), and her live-in boyfriend. And his elderly mother is constantly calling him to do one thing or another for her. He also has an attractive young neighbor whose life is an endless party and he heartily agrees to walk her Saint-Bernard. In short: 'Gianni' is a nice guy who helps everyone out but is somehow feeling empty. His friend 'Alfonso the lawyer' suggests he take a mistress, but 'Gianni' confesses that he's become transparent to women, or so he thinks. 'Gianni' is basically playing his real-life self and so is the rest of the cast: Valeria de Franciscis, Alfonso Santagata, Elisabetta Piccolomini, Valeria Cavalli, Aylin Prandi, Kristina Cepraga, Michelangelo Ciminale, Teresa di Gregorio, Grabiella Sborgi, etc., etc. The women were voluptuously beautiful and very nicely represented a cross-section of the Roman type. This is a great comedy that is looking at life in a very light and positive way. The title of the film in Italian really translates as: ""Gianni and the Women"". However, none of the women in the film are seduced or taken advantage of, by 'Gianni'. There is none of the male clich&eacute;s or motifs associated with earlier Italian films. It's also free of the cynicism and sarcasm of so many similarly related films too. I think what 'Gianni' is missing or has neglected to nurture, will soon see the light of day, by the inspiration the women truly represent. An excellent bittersweet comedy that is more than it seems. Highly recommended, I loved it. The DVD picture and sound quality by Zeitgeist is excellent. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), extras (interview with Gianni di Gregorio), NR 90 mins.

Love and Peace,

5059249,5,B00772SM7C,"This guy - is so likeable, so amusing. I watch this and Mid-August Lunch over and over - not something I normally do but there's a sweet sort of resignation that just speaks to me.",1353888000,3,180,4.171428571428572
5059250,4,B00772SM7C,"You may recall that a few years back Gianni Di Gregorio scored an unexpected hit (big in EUrope, modest in the US) with his directorial debut ""Mid-August Lunch"", in which he is forced to entertain his 93 yr. old mother and her friends. The success of the movie encouraged De Gregario to now come back with this movie, which is not a sequel as such to ""Mid-August Lunch"", but it does feature a number of the same characters, including of course Gianni and his now 95 yr. old (fictional) mother.

In ""The Salt of Life"" (original Italian title ""Gianni and the Ladies""; 2011 release from Italy; 90 min.), Gianni finds himself, at age 60 and being a pensioner, becoming invisible to the opposite sex, and his friend Alfonso is determined to help Gianni find romance again. Meanwhile Gianni must deal with his mom, who calls him frequently when she is sick (real or imagined) or needs help in some way. Gianni's wife and daugther (played by Gianni's real life daughter), along with her slacker boyfriend, are around as well, causing yet more headaches and problems for Gianni. There is no major ""plot"" to speak of, the beauty of the movie is to watch Gianni react to the situations around him, making observations about ageing and wanting to find new meaning (and romance) in life. There are a number of laugh-out-loud scenes in the movie, but the overall tone is more bittersweet than funny. Please note there are a couple of nice extras on the DVD, including a pleasant 20 min. ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary, giving glimpses in the complicated movie-making process, even for such a 'simple' film as this one, as well as an interview with lead actor/writer/director Di Gregorio.

I couldn't help but think back to that other ""Italian"" movie from earlier this year, Woody Allen's ""To Rome With Love"", and how in retrospect so contrived that movie is compared to this one, which by all means brings a real slice of life, not some tourist postcard-like movie. I had seen the trailer for ""The Salt of Life"" a number of times here in Cincinnati when catching other movies, but for whatever reason the movie never did make it here. I didn't realize that the DVD had already come out so when I saw this earlier this week, I immediately snapped it up. So glad I did. If you are in the mood for a funny yet bittersweet top-notch quality foreign movie, ""The Salt of Life"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1352073600,10,2381,4.666666666666667
5059251,5,B00772SM7C,"A kindly look at a man growing older who now gets the crumbs instead of the meat.  We have the idea that he never was a winner - even when young - however we like him all the better for it. His young female neighbor is a goddess at first glance - then we are reminded that what we want is better than what is really there.  In the background, old men are sitting in chairs on the sidewalk - waiting in line to die. But not our guy.  He'll be around for a while - but in a surprise ending - he gets a glimpse of Heaven.",1348790400,5,518,3.7777777777777777
5059252,4,B00772SM7C,"Forced to retire at 50, Gianni finds himself unnecessary in his wife's and daughter's lives (though there's obvious affection, and the little we see of his relationship with his wife has the comfortableness of long companionship). And he is perpetually at his mother's beck and call despite her having a full time caregiver. One of Gianni's friends brings to his attention some of the other older men who area carrying on affairs with younger women and begins encouraging him to pursue his own affair with a younger woman - any younger woman.

Gianni  begins to notice attractive young women everywhere - almost as though surrounded by them (at one point, he is). These beauties, though, almost seem to live in a world where he is a ghost; observing them while he goes unnoticed. He also begins noting a separate world of old men, unconnected to a life with women and fears becoming one of them. He makes awkward attempts with a few of the attractive young women who are aware of him, tries to rekindle an old flame, and gets shanghaied to be ""wingman"" on an attempted double-pickup. Many of the women are unselfconsciously beautiful and charming. Others, simply capitalize on their good looks to encourage older men to spend money on them.

The humor is mostly gentle, and often subtle, relying on lingering moments and tiny shifts of posture and gaze.

""The Salt of Life"" reveals a bit of the difference between the life we have vs. the life we imagine we could have and how they are reconciled (or not).",1329004800,22,1506,4.736641221374046

5059258,5,B00772SM7C,"I've seen this charming film several times and have obviously enjoyed it. It's an Italian import with a particular flavor about the Italy I know well. The theme, however, is universal centering around retirement, boredom, care-giving and wishful thinking. Skillfully acted and directed by Gianni Di Gregorio along with an ensemble of terrific actors, the film poignantly and humorously shows the main character's daily life as a retiree who keeps giving to his mother, family and friends without getting much in return, especially his futile attempts to spice up his sex life. This is why I am so fond of international films of this type. They are filled with the nuisances in people's everyday lives.",1472947200,2,701,5.104347826086957

5059271,4,B00772SM7C,"A movie maybe misunderstood. Poor Gianni isn't transparent to women; they simply take full advantage of his good nature. In addition, they come across as totally self-absorbed and basically selfish from mom, to child, to woman downstairs, to women, wine and no song. It's a though they live in a separate - their own - universe. What goes on in his head? Just the idea of having a woman become involved. There is a secondary theme regarding the state of Italy. The employment situation is not good; the early retirement fully sustains Mik's statement about job getting and neatly aides the bond between them. A great Italian comedy, subtly done, and maybe deeper than meets the eye.",1453420800,,682,4.837606837606837

5059273,4,B00772SM7C,"This follow-on film by Di Grigorio (to Mid-August Lunch) is in a similar vein, with Di Grigorio once again playing a somewhat hapless, passive male. While in Mid-August Lunch, the hero was beset by friends taking advantage of him and saddling him with a caregiver's role, here he is a somewhat lost and sexually frustrated male, taken advantage of by the women in his life--mother, wife, daughter, and various female acquaintances. Here, the hero yearns for love and romance, but is always betrayed both by circumstance, and his own indecisive nature. The Italian title of the film, ""Gianni's Women"" is actually far more accurate, and the English-language title is really off the mark and probably misleading. The non-professional nonagenarian who played his mother in the first film reprises her role again, but plays a far more egotistical and self-centered character who abuses her son's devotion. She certainly proves yet again that she is a natural born actress. I liked this movie less than Mid-August Lunch, but it is still a good and watchable film.",1445817600,,1057,5.080459770114943

5059278,5,B00772SM7C,"Italian movies do not have an ""agenda"" but are instead stories about problems people have. In this movie, Gianni, as he did in ""Mid-August Lunch,"" has a demanding mother who expects him to come every time she calls.  She has a lovely apartment which opens on to a park-like setting that is absolutely beautiful. Gianni, who lives with his wife and daughter, worries about the way his mother spends money.  He himself contributes a small pension to his household, but would like to control his mother's money.  That said, he is still a lovable character who tries to help the people around him.

Writer/director Di Gregorio has a natural style to his acting and directing that you can't help but feel you're there in the thick of things with him.
Whether having to deal with his capricious, spend thrift of a mother, his rather non-plussed wife, a daughter with her own relationship problems, and a bevy of beautiful women, all of which Gianni wants to have an affair with but just can't quite cut the mustard, or pizza I should say, Di Gregorio works to keep his composure and his male sensibility in his ever changing female centric world.

The ending is a delight!

Worth repeat viewing!

5059287,3,B00772SM7C,"I'm sort of shocked that no other reviewers thought this was totally lame or mediocre at best. I'm supposed to feel bad that Gianni at 50 is so beyond curiosity that he can't engage in a meaningful rapport with anyone, or find some kind of interest or way to be generative with his life? That he has at his age developed no talent or usefulness and has no will to do so, or find a new one, or finally that he has failed to develop the adequate spine in his fifty years to set boundaries with his mother and everybody else?

I like watching foreign films because I like seeing a slice of life in another country, picking up a little bit of the language, and seeing actors/real humans that haven't distorted their appearances in the myriad artificial ways that American actors do. For all that, the movie was perfectly lovely.

This movie has all of this,plus,the protagonists' fear of his age,his melancholy about never feeling that exuberance of love again and his patient,kind,attitude toward  all that happens around him. There's comedy, there's family friction,there's feminine pulchritude and a look at Italian culture that makes you say: still a corner of the world that has charm and graceful human foibles.

5059291,4,B00772SM7C,I really enjoyed watching this film.  I viewed the director's first film and was open to having him indulge me into a story about  the angst of an aging Italian man. Frankly any woman who would give a damn about this man's circumstance needs to get her own head examined but to see it with his perspective was enlightening...I actually found myself sympathizing with his situation. The characters are delightful and the nuance in which the lead character portrays his complex relationships are what makes this movie...I give it a 4 out of 5:),1374969600,2,542,4.75531914893617

It was a bit confusing in that respect as the characters were about the same age as in MAL. Gianni's mother is now in a nursing home and seems to have money to throw around, so its an opposite situation to MAL. Confusing.
