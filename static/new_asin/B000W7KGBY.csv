8221484,5,B000W7KGBY,"Having enjoyed the recent coming-of-age vampire tale ""Let the Right One In"", I was on the hunt for other unique vampire tales, and came across this older movie starring Jude Law. I'm no great fan of the actor, but I thought he did a decent turn in this. ""Immortality"" [with the alternate title of ""Wisdom of Crocodiles""] is an unusual vampire tale - Jude Law plays medical consultant Steven Grlscz[a unique and unpronounceable last name] who has a predilection for making young women fall madly in love with him. But this is no ordinary Casanova - Steven has a rare blood disorder in which he has to feed off another human's blood in order to survive and not let his body break down. Trouble is, getting plasma from the local blood bank isn't going to cut it - Steven needs to feed off the 'love' in the victim's blood.

So basically he's a serial killer with a rather unusual modus operandi - until he meets comely, feisty and intelligent structural engineer Anna Labels[Elina Lowensohn] whose sex appeal is matched by her intellectual brilliance. Both are drawn to each other intellectually and sexually, a meeting of hearts and minds if you will. This places Steve in a conundrum - what does he do to survive? Will Anna be another sacrificial victim?

The movie plays out very well - it unfolds leisurely but I never felt this was tedious or plodding. Besides the interaction between Steven and Anna, the other relationship that made this movie interesting was the dynamics between Steven and the police inspector Sgt. Healey [Timothy Spall] investigating him as a murder suspect in a young woman's death. Both Steven and Healey develop a father-son like relationship over the course of the movie and watching the evolution of their relationship is a highlight of this film.

The gore factor is surprisingly minimal in this movie, and even the brutal scenes are artfully done. It plays out beautifully, and the sets are well-done, especially Steven's apartment with its hidden room.

I'd recommend this to those who love a unique vampire tale with first-rate acting.",1273536000,,2069,4.852691218130311
