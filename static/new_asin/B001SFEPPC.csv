3785463,3,B001SFEPPC,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 14 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and seventy-eight through one hundred and ninety-one of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The set contains the Hidden Village of Star arc, Akamaru being infected with a biological weapon, Naruto becoming a ""mother"" to a creature called an Onbaa, Naruto and Shino helping a chief mourner so he can receive his inheritance, and the Land of Greens arc.

The first extra in this set is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 15, which runs for four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and eighty-two.  For each storyboard, you can choose the see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, one Naruto page, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""DVD Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are trailers for: Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom and Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody.  The final link in the extras menu is labeled as ""Game Trailers,"" and it has trailers for: Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2, Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, and Naruto: The Broken Bond.

Sure enough, it's the same cookie-cutter extras I've come to expect on the Naruto Uncut box sets.  I really keep wishing that Viz Media would try to go to some kind of an effort to provide at least somewhat less predictable extras.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then Naruto Uncut Box Set 14 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1286236800,,2213,4.662371134020619

3785465,2,B001SFEPPC,"Well what can we say, it's Naruto fillers. It is a great pick to complete the library if you can stomach the lack of cohesiveness in the storyline. It is basically missions after mission that does not relate to the main story arc. The lack of continuity is apparent, however; there are some redeeming qualities. I enjoyed the Star village filler as well as the Princes story arc. The story in themselves can be funny at times, as well as interesting. Just be patient with this anime, trust me when the main storyline picks up in Naruto Shippuuden you will not be disappointed. Though Shippuuden will contain fillers, I believe the writers of Naruto learned their lesson from this regular series. That is, they blended the fillers with the main story arc, making the Shippuuden series flow alongside the main story arc. They did the right thing in Shippuuden. However; with this series (Regular Naruto), you are gonna get 100+ unrelated fillers until the series goes Shippuuden. Great buy for those who wish to have a complete collection, but if you cannot stomach the fillers, best skip and wait for Shippuuden to be released. As far as DVD quality, it's great quality, offering both Eng/Jap lang and subtitles. Also it comes with a few more game cards to add to your player deck.",1241568000,5,1280,4.744394618834081
