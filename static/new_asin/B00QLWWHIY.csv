8691879,3,B00QLWWHIY,"John's Horror Corner: REC 4: Apocalypse (2014), a shipwrecked disappointment for this Spanish zombie franchise.
Spanish TV reporter ngela Vidal (Manuela Velasco; REC) is rescued [picking up from the end of the second REC film] and sequestered for precautionary testing aboard a mobile laboratory on an ocean vessel.  Finding herself in restraints, she doesn't exactly feel ""rescued"" or safe, nor does she trust her new host.

This fourth franchise installment frees us from our most effectively isolated landlocked apartment building zombie siege and infected flesh-eating wedding to quarantine us on a ship.  With no rescue boats and disabled radio communication, it seems that our militarized team of scientists have not only succeeded at finally isolating the virus behind the zombie epidemic, but also at sealing their own fate should operations go less than smoothly.

We have plenty of time to get to know our characters but I think we barely sufficiently give a damn about most of them, not nearly as much as with REC 1-3.  Parts 1-3 not only laid solid foundation for personable characters, but did so while the urgency level slowly ebbed from completely innocuous happy environments to utter dire terror.  Here in part 4 we are dropped into troubled waters immediately and neither we nor our main characters have their guard down for even a momentnot even for a 20-minute introduction during which we'd like for someone to think there was hope.  As such, there is no hope that we'll care what happens to these people and subsequently no hope that we the audience will feel the threat of ""Apocalypse"" as the title suggests.

Rather than being well-intentioned, altruistic or optimistic, our scientist-commander is viciously pragmatic and his coldness borders on villainy.  This operation is tyrannical by his design and, spoiler alert, all his security provisions will fail.  Cue the evil zombie monkeys!!!  You heard me: zombie monkeys.  Zombie animals alone don't harm the legitimacy of a horror movie, but the way they are handled here does.  They start out cool, then they go overboard.

Shipmates get infected, the gore and zombie effects are pretty good, and the action is high-paced.  I'm entertained.  The only problem is that I don't really care.  I'm far less invested in the characters and even though this is not a found footage film, the camera relentlessly shakes during zombie attack scenes (as if the Starship Enterprise got hit by a Klingon photon canon--you know that shake).  But the camera is admittedly less shaky than the preposterous story of a ship laboratory that willingly sets its course into a dangerous stormand they never explain why.  This sequel bit off more than it could chew, feels way less credible than parts 1-3, and fell off the deep end into ScyFy channel movie-of-the-week quality.

The most interesting thing about the story is perhaps the very thing most people will find annoying.  In REC 3: Genesis (2012), we were introduced to the notion that this zombie virus had a Biblical origin: demons!  This movie builds on that idea and may or may not have borrowed some flavor from The Hidden (1987) and Guillermo del Toro's parasitic worm zombies in The Strain.  This development takes things in a zany direction that provides a solid disservice to its three predecessors.

This movie isn't really bad as a random horror flick.  It's certainly well-acted, has decent special effects and production value, and it made for a breezy entertaining 90 minutes.  So I'll give this a weak to moderate recommendation.  Fans of the franchise should see it (although I think it offers the least of the four films and will likely disappoint to some extent), zombie fans maybe, and general horror fans could skip it.

To writer/director Jaume Balaguer (Darkness, REC, REC 2), I must ask: ""What happened?""  The claustrophobia of the first two films is rendered limp on this ship (more a writing/direction flaw than the setting itself), the spirit of fun embraced in part 3 (which most people disliked for its deliberate drop in intensity) is also missing, and I wasn't rooting for anyone for the first time in the franchise.  Essentially this fourth film has nothing that anyone liked from the earlier films  and brought nothing new to the table.",1456012800,,4280,5.028368794326241

8691881,5,B00QLWWHIY,"This is a fantastic sequel and certainly the best and most entertaining since the second part, like the second movie its action packed with a great continuation of the story, its good that this part takes place almost immediately after the events of the second movie as we follow a group of soldiers storm the original apartment building to extract Angela (Manuela Velasco) the same fine actress reprising her role, then they are all taken to a ship in the middle of the ocean where scientists are doing tests in a secret lab, when an infected carrier gets loose all hell breaks loose literally, the movie ties in well with all the other three movies as references are made to them, the story is a good way to continue the series, it still keeps its creepy dark claustrophobic settings and fantastic zombie effects and make-up and of course loads of bloody violence, the cast is all great, Manuela Velasco is sexy and looks good as the female lead yet again, this is a top horror movie all round, very entertaining, this is a great original series that always goes forward with its ideas, there's a few good little twists in the story, I was kind of hoping for a more dramatic ending but its satisfying enough to know the franchise can pretty much go anywhere by this point. The apocalypse has only just begun.",1426636800,3,1310,4.602564102564102
