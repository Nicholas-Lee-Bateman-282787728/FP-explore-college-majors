8257763,5,B00158K1C8,"If you do not have these two movies I feel sorry for you. They are both wonderful films with wonderful actors and actress's. I have always loved Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne. But, Chow Yun Fat and Jodie Foster did right by them on the remake.",1433635200,,242,4.282608695652174

8257767,5,B00158K1C8,Enjoyed the movie. Receive the movie as promise.,1412985600,,48,5.125
8257768,3,B00158K1C8,"The first ""Anna"" was almost quaint in its focus and use of caucasions in the role of the Siamese people.  I enjoyed it, but truly liked the newer ""Anna and the King""  more because it felt more real.  Both Chow Yun Fat and Jodie Foster are terrific in their roles.  I was also surprised to see Tom Felton as ""Louis"".  I am more used to seeing him as Drako Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies.",1407283200,,389,4.133333333333334
8257769,5,B00158K1C8,Good movies.  I did not like the newer version as much as the older one.  It makes you look at the map and think about the country.,1383523200,2,131,3.814814814814815
8257770,5,B00158K1C8,I love the original and new version. They both make a lovely point about love and life. I love Jody Foster.,1370736000,2,107,4.142857142857143
