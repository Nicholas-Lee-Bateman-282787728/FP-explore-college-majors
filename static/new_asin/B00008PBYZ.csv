1856726,4,B00008PBYZ,"An extremely charming film, beautifully told. Believe it or not, it's basically a women's movie, but I liked it anyway. One of the messages is quite a reactionary one, but also believable. I will look for more from this director.",1298419200,2,229,4.75
1856727,4,B00008PBYZ,"I enjoyed the movie.  It teaches you a little bit about the Ottoman Empire from the point of view of women assigned to the ruler's harem.  At first, I didn't want to see it because I thought it was some sort of porn, but it isn't at all.  It's a decent movie.",1279238400,18,259,3.9423076923076925
1856728,3,B00008PBYZ,This movie was not what I thought it was.  I was looking for something more titillating.,1251331200,5,88,4.5
1856729,2,B00008PBYZ,"The setup of the movie sounds great. Lush historical drama set in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Innovative way of story telling, a bit like the magical realism of novels. The story of Safiye is told by 2 voices: 1)by her maid servant to other royal concubines in the harem square as if it's a legend. 2)by herself as an old woman to an young woman whom she met at a train station in Italy. This seems to me hints that Safiye's story isn't that unique afterall. She's just the latest heroin living thru the life of a harem concubine.

While the story has great promises, it's very badly executed. The pace is ultra slow. Yes, this is not an action movie. It's just the movie often feels stalled. Dialogue seems forced. Poison? that's pretty lame as palace intrigue, isn't it? Romance with an eunuch? Wow, how surprising. Like there's any other man around... Turkish bath scenes seem to drag on and on. After a while, it doesn't serve any dramatic purpose except pandering to those after some exoticism. Worst of all is that acting is not convincing at all.

Bottom line: 1 star for the storyline and 1 more for the costume.",1152316800,16,1130,4.507317073170731
1856730,5,B00008PBYZ,"This movie has a good story telling the life of a girl in a Harem, and the many persons inside of it, and stories inside the Harem. Marie Gillain has a good performance in this movie, she shows she has talent for this kind of characters, and of course she looks incredible oof her clothes. There's a good direction too but the movie can be slow sometimes.",1114214400,7,355,4.313432835820896
1856731,3,B00008PBYZ,"This 1999 film in Turkish, Italian and French seemed interesting.  It's set in 1908 during the fall of the Ottoman Empire and depicts one of the last harems.  It's also a story of intrigue and romance.  Some of it was quite interesting, especially the depictions of the daily life of the women.  The acting was good and the mood was set just right, the cinematography showing the opulence of the palace as well as its restrictions.

Something was wrong with the screenplay however.  My guess is that too much was left on the cutting room floor. As per the cover of the DVD, it was supposed to last 1 hour and 45 minutes.  However, the disc I viewed was only about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It was hard to figure out exactly what was happening and the story didn't fit together at all. There were flashbacks and flash forwards held together by a tale told by a servant which seemed to foretell the future.  And the ending left a lot of questions unanswered.

Therefore, although there were some parts of this film that were good, and it might have been better when it was playing in the theaters, I just cannot recommend this DVD.",1109980800,26,1127,4.453658536585366
1856732,5,B00008PBYZ,"I own the VHS of this movie, and can tell you it is based on fact. What a tragic tale told so wonderfully. It has been said there is a lot of nudity, but truly not as much as one could expect. This film really does give the viewer a trip into the royal Turkish harem at the end of the Empire! You won't be disappointed.",1050451200,26,319,3.8484848484848486
1856733,5,B00008PBYZ,"What a lovely film.  The art direction, costumes, and scenery alone make it worthwhile.",1440547200,,87,5.214285714285714

1856740,2,B00008PBYZ,Poor script and equally poor acting. I thought it was not the best film at all. It was hard to watch because it was slooooooooow moving,1396828800,,135,4.230769230769231
1856741,4,B00008PBYZ,Interesting twist on an old storyline . The character studies are the best features in this sexy interplay of an adventure .,1385510400,,124,4.681818181818182
1856742,3,B00008PBYZ,"Interesting because of the historical context. The film addresses an interesting question: when the Ottoman Empire collapsed after WW1 what happened to the women who made up the Sultan's Harem?  Isolated and pampered, what did they know about the impending collapse of the centuries old Empire and how did they survive afterwords?",1378684800,,330,5.346153846153846
1856743,1,B00008PBYZ,Ordered by accident. Did not view it. So I cannot give you even 7 more words on how I liked this film,1375056000,,101,3.6363636363636362

1856746,1,B00008PBYZ,"This is outrageous. I started watching Harem and was really interested (the movie is really good), but I could not finish seeing it that day. Now, when I try to see it two days after Amazon tells me that due to licensing agreement I cannot see this movie in instant view. What a really poor service Amazon is providing here.",1312243200,2,324,4.416666666666667
1856747,5,B00008PBYZ,"I could not stop watching it once I started. I did not mind the subtitles The richness of the setting The politics of life inside a harem. The tenderness of love between two forbidden lovers. The strength and courage of the main character._ Her will to survive and tenderness even after such loss in the world of men or Maybe because I'm older; but I felt such an affinity for the older version of the main character. The loss of beauty; outward that is. Her inward beauty to me still remained. I found myself hoping the rest of her life would be
 filled with peace and happiness. Some would call this a chick flik; to me it is a human flik I've always been a sucker for love stories.",1311984000,,684,4.3023255813953485
1856748,1,B00008PBYZ,"I haven't seen the movie, but an online preview that shows nothing but an empty set with credits rolling is NOT an enticement to take the next step to become a viewer! How did THIS become the preview scene?",1310947200,4,206,4.3076923076923075
1856749,1,B00008PBYZ,"Sexual Freedom?  This video did not showcase any such thing as ""sexual freedom"".  I was anticipating a little more erotic on this film.  The plot was terrible; the transition between the monarchy and the ""constitutional monarchy"" did not unfold very well.  The viewer didn't really observe a whole lot of interacation between the sultan and the protagonist - Safiya.  There were not enough life themes presented in this movie.  It was a waste of time and money.

S.T.",1309824000,4,467,4.910256410256411
1856750,5,B00008PBYZ,I enjoyed watching this movie. The conflict between modern and old perspectives of serfdom is interesting. It is also interesting to see the change in the women status a century ago and to compare it to status quo today in e.g. the middle east.,1307577600,,244,4.568181818181818
1856751,4,B00008PBYZ,"This is the story of the last days and final fall of the Ottoman Empire as seen through the career of a member of the sultan's harem. While some parts of this story are presented in a rather sketchy manner, character development is good, and you actually care about the people involved - even the bad ones! The photography is beautiful, and the scenes in the bathhouse are appropriately steamy. The Instant Video version ran approximately one hour and forty-five minutes.",1302134400,3,471,4.827160493827161
1856752,4,B00008PBYZ,"The story-within-a-story approach works very well in this movie.  The directing was at times a bit slow, but that suits the movie itself.  The acting was quite good.  We really enjoyed the complexity of the Eunich Nadir and his erotic love for the the main character.",1301184000,,267,4.760869565217392
