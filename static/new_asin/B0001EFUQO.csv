8011244,3,B0001EFUQO,"The key to Dona Barbara is the character herself, all else is subservient to her.  She is a deeply injured character whose brutal and murderous personality is the result of watching the man she loved shot to death and her vicious gang rape by a group of men while she was very young.  While this version of Dona Barbara is the most fetching environmentally, it sags from the lack of depth in her character.  It is more an adventure movie than a study of civilization (Santos Luzardo) and the darkness of willfulness (Dona Barbara) in conflict. The TV novella was long and repetitive and the character of Dona Barbara was mostly swallowed up in an over written story.  However, the black and white film with Maria Felix is an eye opener because Felix went deep into her character and lights up the screen with her performance.  I have watched it many times and it is an extremely vigorous film with a screen play by Gallegos and directed by de Fuentes.  Low budget and with little exteriors, it is more like a play that holds you to the screen as Maria Felix reveals the layers of her character, Dona Barbara.  The men are a rather a homely group, the horses small and thinned legged, and there is singing, yet  it is the only version I have watched that is closes to Gallegos intent and it has stayed with me.",1408579200,,1309,4.470588235294118
8011245,2,B0001EFUQO,"Mrs. Kaplan can tell us that she did an exhaustive review of Mr. Rmulo Gallegos manuscripts, so she could express in a better way what he meant, or that Mrs. Goris begged at her door for the role of Doa Brbara, anyway, is very sad to see the result.

Nobody, nobody will ever be able to portray Doa Brbara in a convincing manner after the job Mara Flix did. There is a reason why Gallegos himself choose her for the role. Esther Goris, Edith Gonzlez, Madonna, Jane Doe, will never have what it takes to stand in front of the camera and say: I am Doa Brbara in a way that you can believe it.

And then, to make it worse, after a ''fight'', Betty Kaplan's weak character Doa Brbara is panting, very close to Ruth Gabriel, who has her blouse halfway open, in a very suspicious way while looking down at her breasts... then look at her eyes and then once more down there. What was that for? that's ridiculous!

Really? Is that what Mr Gallegos had in mind when he wrote the book, or is it just Ms Kaplan wild imagination...?",1316908800,,1020,4.274611398963731
8011246,5,B0001EFUQO,"This film is a wonderful example of the golden age of Mexican cinema.  The script was co-written by Gallegos, the author of the novel, and more closely follows the original work than later film adaptations.  In the role of Doa Barbara - the devoradora de hombres, Maria Felix is the ideal match of actress and role.  One caveat is that there are no sub-titles.  The audio is in Spanish only.  However, even those viewers who may be Spanish challenged, but have read the novel, will enjoy this movie.",1250467200,2,499,4.625
8011247,2,B0001EFUQO,The movie was very dissapointing.  The picture was so dark that I couldn't tell who was who.  The purchase was a waste of time & money.,1222732800,6,135,4.153846153846154
8011248,4,B0001EFUQO,"I really enjoyed watching this, the storyline moved so quickly I was thinking it could have been a telenovela. I think there are 4 versions of this made. Produced in 1943 and 1998 as movies and the telenovelas were 1964 and 1975. I've only watched this one (1998), a bit to young to have watched the 1964 or 1975 telenovelas--anybody watch these?

Then, I noticed they are airing this as a telenovela starting next week in my area---can't wait!!! It will be interesting to see the 2008 production on TV. Edith Gonzalez (who I think is amazing!) is playing Dona Barbara and they filmed it in Colombia so I know it's going have amazing scences.

I really like the campo-type movies/telenovelas--horses, wilderness, scenary, and of cousre latin cowboys:o) And if you do too, you will enjoy this one.",1217289600,,796,4.760869565217392

8011251,4,B0001EFUQO,"I cannot compare Betty Kaplans Dona Barbara to the version where Maria Felix played Dona Barbara, since I have not seen that version.  However, Betty Kaplans film version does do justice to the book by Romulo Gallegos.  The music is very original and remains with you for days after having seen the movie.  Location where movie was filmed has many of the characteristics and flavor described by Gallegos in the book. The acting is not bad and some performances are entralling.  I would recommend this movie whether or not you have read the book.  It would be more enjoyable if you read the book, preferably in Spanish in its original form.",1104105600,9,639,4.7207207207207205
