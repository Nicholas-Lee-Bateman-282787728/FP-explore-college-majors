7946374,3,B00005N8A6,"first of all this is a comedy,an english humoured one. The film is not sopposed to be totaly based in reality .All the characters are zany and mostly over the top. The film goes like this. The main character Vigil Guppy buys a car, 4 milse down the road it bonks out and he wants his money back..He's a nice guy with a bad friend who wants to frame him for murder and does. Everyone including his girlfriend seems to give incriminating evidence against him but it's all out of contex. Poor virgill feeling he has nothing left to lose gives his money and credit cards to a bum on the street and then gets hit by a woman driving a stolen car. That incident was actualy a stroke of luck as it leads him down the road of finding out who the real kiler is. Unfortunatly for Virgil more bodies pile up along the way,plus he's got an inspector with a good nose and a rookie sidekick who's waiting for the chance to fire his weapon,like he tained for. Add in some other quircky characters  and it makes for a funny movie. If you like funny imperfect comedies with a bit of a who-done it then you'll like this movie. I don't know who is on the cover of the dvd either ,so there you go.",1200528000,,1176,4.180616740088106

After a while I just thought ""so what?"" and didn't care what the characters did as long as it would just end. If Godzilla had jumped out of the sea at the end and swallowed everyone for a surprise abstract ending, it would have had at least had one good scene in it.",1176249600,,403,4.113924050632911
