525052,5,6302969565,"Shohei Imamura did something astonishing with his film 'The Ballad of Narayama.'  Not only did he attempt to update a popular Japanese legend, he  was creating an alternate version of the established classic, made by  Keisuke Kinoshita [see Twenty Four Eyes] at the height of his powers.  Reverence for the aged is a hallmark of Japanese society, so the ancient  tradition of mountain people of exposing their no-longer productive  relations on a mountaintop to die is very shocking to the Japanese.  Kinoshita addressed the legend in a very stylized way, distancing the  viewer from the action and thereby making the actions of these poor people  somehow less terrible.  Imamura, in stark contrast, emphasized the savagery  of the traditional mountain society by parallelling it with the savagery of  the natural world in which it, too, must survive.  Imamura thereby makes  the tradition seem somewhat inevitable and all the more moving because of  its inexorability. These people aren't inhuman savages.  They are survivors  in a harsh environment.  Imamura examines character so honestly that the  people he depicts are revealed in their true humanity, and their actions  are shown to be all the more tragic.  A triumph for Imamura.",967161600,45,1236,5.204081632653061

The long trek to the mountain with the grandmother was emotionally draining to watch.  Her stoicism was amazing in accepting her fate with grace, dignity, courage and also honor in how she tried to pass her wealth of knowledge onto those who would remain alive in her family.

525068,5,6302969565,"This is with no doubt one of the best movies about the real nature of life.
It is not an easy movie, as our modern society drives us from the cycles of life specially death, and the scenes - in the opposite direction - bring ourselves back into the natural cycles: sex, birth, existence and death.

Death has been banished of the modern society, always being delt as something that happens to the ""others"", they die - never us. There are offers of eternal youth through the industry, beauty and youth in a pot, we don't kill chicken anymore in the backyard and death was removed from our houses, the movies always show scenes where non-americans are killed in massive ""commoditie"" clean deaths ta-ta-ta / done, followed by scenes of one or two glorious americans dying, the next scene always a tribute to their glorious lives and the suffer of their families. The other families are never remembered.

The movie is remarkable. If you enjoy scenes with firing guns, explosions and special effects that mask reality, the movie will impact you, maybe you will not stand so much reality.

If you are a mature person, the confirmation of your meaning of life is about to be exhibited.",1327017600,,1179,4.685990338164252

525070,4,6302969565,"This is a movie with wonderful cinematography & a well defined script given that its purpose is to show life on the hard edge of survival. Just the kind of movie I would expect to like. The images on screen are bold, bleak or disturbing & sometimes all three. I rate this as 4 Amazon stars.

The hard edge of survival here is more because of the hardened demeanor the characters in the movie take toward their lot in life. I saw more food & less human spirit in this show than any other hard circumstance movie I've seen. In VIDAS SECAS a family struggles against overwhelming odds of place, society & their own talents but they don't struggle from lack of heart. They want to change their circumstances & aren't afraid to take responsibility to effect that change. In Narayama there is no heart, no breath & no desire for any change. They only want to get to the next meal & finally death. There are plenty of meals in the show.

Some scenes will disturb you. Some shots are breathtaking in simplicity & clarity. I have no trouble believing that there were villages like Narayama in the world. I just don't believe that all of the people in them were so sold out to being powerless. That is my feeling on the subject. Most human groups have a rebel or two. Rebellion in Narayama would be the belief that the citizens could make their own life better. Whether the rebel won or lost the movie needed that, at least it did for me. That is what lost the movie 1 star.

There is an earlier version by Keisuke Kinoshita (1958) which has the same title. It tells the story in the classical Japanese manner & leaves the disturbing realism out. The soundtrack is very Kabuki also. Having seen both I can say that doing so enhances the experience of both. They are complete opposites in their manner of storytelling. Watch Kinoshita's if you're thin-skinned & Imamura's if you're thick-skinned & intend to only watch one. Should this movie appeal to you don't skip Vidas Secas if you can find it.",1294704000,4,1987,4.483425414364641
525071,5,6302969565,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's brutal, but for people who live in this harsh environment these brutal laws are the only chance to survive. I've read many books about the Russian eskimos and the other people of the North who live in similar conditions - they have very similar brutal laws and customs. Strict children selection, severe punisments for theft - all these realities could be found in the North as well. Like in this Japanese village, the old people, when they can no longer work, go to the forest, make the final fire and freeze to death. This movie is not a fantasy, but the reality of survival in the harsh environment. This movie shows how the people live close to the nature, struggle with it, yet truly integrated into it? Excellent staging, great actors make this film a true masterpiece.",1276214400,2,827,4.594594594594595
525072,5,6302969565,"""The Ballad of Narayama"" envisions a Hobbesian dystopia set in an impoverished village of feudal Japan. It's inhabitants don't simply live close to nature; they are a part of nature. In a lush valley landscape amid a lovely mountain backdrop, the villagers subsist much like animals, dependent on what little they can eke out of the land.

These farmers are filthy, malnourished, and vicious to one another. In the first half-hour of the film, we learn that they beat their kin, sell their children as chattel, throw their dead babies into fields as fertilizer and, when their elders reach the arbitrary age of 70, carry them to the mountains and leave them to die of exposure or starvation. This final pilgrimage is as much a sacrifice to the endemic hunger of the community as it is to the mountain gods, the gods who will supposedly reunite in the afterlife all those who perform the rituals they demand.

In this society, only eldest children have any value, while younger ones, their teeth rotting, their bodies covered in rags, are treated no better than slaves. They form a despised underclass that is alternately neglected, abused, and raped. Life for them is, quite literally, nasty, brutish, and short. Sex and death are ever-present, both in the human and the natural worlds; presented unblinkingly, these things are nothing to be surprised by, afraid of, embarrassed about, or sorry for. The peasants are impulsive and lusty, they sing songs that are bawdy and crude, they urinate and defecate openly. Mating, eating, excreting, dying: all are seen without shame as equally elemental and necessary functions.

Survival depends on dogged persistence in the face of adversity and on a ruthless willingness to discard anyone and anything, including sympathetic and filial emotions, that do not contribute to survival. Justice is swift and pitiless. A family that steals and hoards food is thrashed by a mob, their house is pillaged and, in short order, they are buried alive by a band of villagers. Not even children and pregnant women are afforded mercy.

While all of this sounds relentlessly miserable and depressing, ""The Ballad of Narayama"" is not without humor, since its characters are so human. They are petty and bumbling at one moment, proud and noble at another, and sometimes craven and courageous in the same breath. Much mirth arises from the stark contrast of these characteristics, and the extremes in the film make it impossible to forget that this is an over-the-top retelling of an ancient legend rather than a realistic or believable cultural portrait.

The story's central protagonists are an irresistably wry old woman, Orin, who faces death despite her rude good health and indomitable vitality, and her son Tatsuhei, whose duty it is to abandon her to the wilderness. Yet Orin doesn't fear her imminent demise as much as she does the prospect that her son will not find a wife or that he will not have the nerve to carry out his obligations and thereby shame her before the other villagers, as his father did. She sets about arranging things with single-minded efficiency and a seemingly inexhaustible reservoir of joie de vivre.

The journey at the film's climax is predictably bleak, yet it has both a stark beauty and an unquestionable magnificence to it. The cinematography, as many reviewers have noted, is stunning throughout, as is the naturalistic acting of the cast. For an appreciation of a very Japanese esthetic, I highly recommend this cinematic masterpiece by Shohei Imamura, whose equally searing film ""Black Rain,"" about a family that survives the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, is also recommended.",1273104000,5,3646,5.038142620232173
525073,5,6302969565,"The only simple way to sum up this film is to call it a masterpiece, and one that needs to be seen. The Japanese with films like Ikiru, Tokyo Story Maborosi or this years big winner at the academy awards Departures have made a series of films about death that look upon with a caring eye, never going into morbidity or cheesiness that would permeate an American melodrama. Out of those esteemed films directed by the likes of Ozu and Kurosawa I can say that Shohei Imamaura directed the best with this film a movie that isn't about dealing with death in any form but coming to accept that in the end We all die and its something that despite what we may try to do to look away fromt that fact needs to be accepted.
The main story itself concerns a small farming village in Japan where life is tough and peasants live from harvest to harvest. To support themselves better its been decreed that when a person reaches seventy years of age one of their children load them up take them to the top of a mountain where they're left to starve and die. Orin the protagonist of the story is sixty-nine and despite being in general good health starts readying for the trip with one problem in that she's trying to help her sons general problems like finding a wife, or getting woman to sleep with him.
The movies more than just that as it observes this little village over a period of time to the end. Tatsuhito her eldest son is a bit gruff and unfortunately understands what she's doing while his own son falls in love with a girl who's family steals from the village and in the end suffers a horrible fate (pulled off in one shot amazingly well). But in the end with the characters well defined and the story as good as it is what makes the film a masterpiece are the final scenes dialogue free as Tatsuhito loads Orin onto his back and begins the journey up the mountain climaxing in a final shot of Ogatas face sitting before a fire.
In the end nothing I can say will tell you how great this movie is. But to me the movie is one of those that can easily be qualified as a masterpiece
I will say that its a bit disappointing someone like Criterion didn't handle the release of the film. Not that Animeigos release is bad. In fact it stands with their best work and thankfully didn't recieve a woeful release like Samurai Assassin or Incident at Blood Pass. Its just that a film this good needs some type of extra material. I don't say that a lot but something like a release Criterion did for The Lower Depths or even some archival interview footage would be nice. Despite that complaint its good to have the film on DVD with a great presentation. If you haven't seen it and have an interest in Japanese cinema definitely check it out.",1247443200,,2728,4.361493123772102
525074,3,6302969565,"You know it's a Shohei Imamura film when you see someone urinating in the first scene. Soon after, defecation makes an appearance too. Imamura glories in grotesquery like no other major Japanese director. Even at his nicest (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warm-Water-Under-a-Red-Bridge/dp/B000094J5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warm Water Under a Red Bridge</a>"", my favourite film of his), he really likes bodily functions and awkward, unexpected acts of violence. Imamura's early film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pornographers/dp/B00009MEA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pornographers</a>"" was about a sleazy, incompetent porn merchant who thoroughly fails in life. His later film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Akagi/dp/B00007JZVT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Akagi</a>"" expanded the scope, depicting pretty much all of pre-war Japanese society as bumbling and grotesque. ""The Ballad Of Narayama"" is set earlier, in the 19th century, but it also suggests that Imamura is unique among Japanese artists, in that he has very little love for Japanese culture and history.

The peasants in this film live in a harsh environment and have to struggle, but their poverty is not necessarily desperate. They have stores of food, and some of them have firearms and horses. They live to seventy, and often are in good health at that age. Their houses are old, but fairly large, with elaborate layers of straw-furnished lofts. But, they are always shown wearing filthy rags. The rags by themselves are unsurprising. For instance, Kurosawa's peasants in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>"" are also ragged and poor, and prone to infighting. But, the last scene of ""Seven Samurai"" shows the peasant girls dressed in bright, pretty clothes for a rice-planting ceremony, which has a spirit of collective harmony. Imamura's film never shows any such event. Everyone always looks drab.

Continuing the contrast, Kurosawa's peasants could be cruel, like when the village elders gave away one guy's wife to a group of bandits. But that was a singular event, caused by an external threat, and traumatized the entire village for a long time. In ""The Ballad Of Narayama,"" the peasants think nothing of killing unwanted children, or selling them into slavery. There are no bandits around; this is widely practiced and viewed as routine.

There is no compassion in Imamura's film. The values of the peasant society revolve around saving face. The husband of the old woman Orin deserted the family years ago (or tried to). Orin hates him, but not because he abandoned her. Her only grievance is that he embarrassed the family.

Family loyalty exists only in the form of subservience to the head of the household. Only the eldest son in a family is viewed as a human being. Younger sons (""yakko"") are used as slaves. They are despised and pushed around by the entire village, and have no hope of ever getting married. This causes them to engage in deviant sexual practices, which are gleefully expounded upon by Imamura.

The peasants have a form of collective justice, where they all gather to accuse and judge possible criminals. However, it is clearly shown that this ritual can also serve as an excuse to loot somebody's house and take all his food. If someone is ""convicted,"" his entire family is horribly killed, which evokes no remorse in anyone. Orin, the film's de facto protagonist, coldly deceives a young girl into going back to her parents' house, when it has already been condemned. The girl's husband is upset, but not for long; he finds another girl quickly.

Oh, and the head of a household eventually has to ""go to the mountain,"" which means getting taken to a desolate wilderness and being abandoned there to starve to death. The only appearances of any religious beliefs in the film all revolve around this ritual.

This is a grim world. Imamura scrupulously chooses every image to reinforce its grimness. Scenes of dialogue are separated by shots of insects, reptiles and rodents -- mantis eating frog, mantis eating mantis, snake eating mouse. The sex scenes are followed by shots of rodents mating. The subtext is unsubtle -- life here is governed by reptilian, rodent instincts and force.

In another time, this film might have been a novel in the style of ""critical realism."" It has a lot in common with Zola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Earth/dp/0140443878/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Earth</a>, which attacked French peasantry in the 19th century in much the same way as ""The Ballad Of Narayama."" Like the critical realists, Imamura uses earthy details that other film-makers demurely gloss over (Imamura's sex scenes are not graphic, but they're obscenely carnal in tone) to create a sense of authenticity. But, also like the critical realists, he might not be entirely reliable. The chilling scenes in the ""graveyard"" at the end of the film are visually striking; the content is horrifying, impossible to forget. But that's exactly the part that isn't real! It's a fanciful image, a bad dream.

But although that scene is very dark, its unearthly coldness gives it a certain harsh majesty. For that very reason, Imamura interrupts the scene's gloomy dignity with yet another grotesque image, involving the old man who doesn't want to go to the mountain. He purposely doesn't allow the film to become poetic.

""The Ballad Of Narayama"" is not a ""lyrical drama."" Imamura's worldview in this film might be described as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/inhumanism/dp/0804741085/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">inhumanism</a>."" The film viscerally participates in the lives of the peasants; it is alternately ice-cold and searingly carnal. But it leaves no room for sympathy. What little shines through is quickly drowned out by an all-powerful fatalism.",1245456000,12,6081,5.739178690344062
525075,5,6302969565,"There are some classic images in Japanese film, scenes that stick with you long after the film is over.  Takakura Ken, tattooed and brandishing his sword, about to take vengeance for his master.  A hill with five mounds, each with a sword sticking from the top.  This scene of Ogata Ken carrying his mother on his back, climbing up the mountain where he will leave her to die, has got to be among them.  It is a powerful and moving image.

""The Ballad of Narayama"" (""Narayama Bushiko"") is a re-make of the 1958 film of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/same-name/dp/B0018L9M5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">same name</a>, which is in turn an adaptation of two books by Fukuzawa Shichiro, ""The Ballad of Narayama"" and ""The Men of Tohoku"", which were in turn based on an old folk legend called ""The Mountain where Old People were Abandoned"" from the 11th Century book Konjaku Monogatari.  This is not true history, and there is no evidence that such a tradition ever existed outside of folktales.  Life in the mountains was undeniably harsh, but not to the extent that human beings were abandoned like so much garbage.

A film does not have to be historically accurate, however, to have impact.  Under the skilled hand of director Imamura Shohei, the story becomes an allegory for the physicality of human life, for the ephemeral nature of being alive.  Characters reduced to their most primal aspects of survival do little more than gather food, have sex when they can, making new people to repeat the cycle, then grow old and become a burden with the younger generation silently hoping they would die off and clear some room.  I was struck by how little human society has changed over the years, and by how much of my life I spend doing those very same things, just following my instincts and obeying my biological imperative.

""The Ballad of Narayama"" is all about the biological imperative, and the conflict involved when animals are allowed to think and feel.  Ogata Ken (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vengeance-Is-Mine/dp/B000NOK0GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vengeance Is Mine</a>) plays Tatsuhei, a strong and gruff man who is the leader of his family.  He is a violent and primal character, but even this is mostly bluster.  Inside, he is torn up over the ritual of carrying his beloved mother up the mountain to her death.  But she will not be shamed, and demands that her son complete his task with dignity.  All of the needs of survival and the pressures of survival drive him towards this, but he lacks the strength of will to stand against it.

While a brilliant film, it is not without its faults.  Imamura intercuts the film with images of animals procreating, birthing and dieing, but sometimes the metaphor is too heavy handed.  We get it, OK?  Tone it down a little.  Also, during the most dramatic part of the film, the climb up the mountain, the music is a synthesized bass line that does not suit the mood at all.  For such a powerful and primal scene, electronic music was not the best choice.

These are minor faults though, and completely overshadowed by the rest of the film.  An amazing movie by an amazing director.",1222300800,7,3223,5.035849056603774

525088,5,6302969565,"Quite a few Asian films - Korean, Japanese, Chinese - explore the meaning of old age and specifically the cycle of life. This is one of the great themes of this film.  The essential fact of this movie is that, through custom (and religion), the parents who reach age 70 are to leave the society and meet their end on the top of the Mountain Narayama.  In a sense, it is both frightening and sacred.  The cycle of life continues with the younger generation.

Everyone who sees this provocative movie will talk about its striking visual beauty.  But more importantly, it strikes a nerve - how should society allocate its scarce resources.  Ironically, the fact that the old are left to die by exposure is not necessarily a statement that the elders are not valued by the society.  The old are valued...but they need to recognize their function in letting the young take their place.  The act of death, therefore, becomes a sacred rite. This is very vividly presented in the last frames.

This is a thinking person's film.  It also depicts in visual form a very primitive society, letting us have a picture of what the world must have looked like 10,000 years ago.

Based of the old and unusual Japanese legend, Shohei Imamura's ""The Ballad of Narayama"" won the Golden Palm in 1983 Cannes Festival. Set in the 19th century in a remote mountain village in the north of the country, it tells of the custom according to which when a person reached 70 years old they were taken to the top of Mount Narayama and left there to die.

When I saw ""The Ballad of Narayama"" back in the 80s, I did not know anything about it. There were no commercials; the film was not widely released. I think it was only two shows in the theater near our house in Moscow. All we knew that the film was a Cannes Festival winner. Our sons were little then, we did not have a babysitter, and we bought tickets to two different shows. My husband went first, and when he came back, I waited for him at the door, ready to leave. He looked quiet, serious and withdrawn when he returned home. I asked him how the movie was and he said to me to go and see it, and then we'd talk...After I came home, I did not want to talk, I did not know what to say, I was overwhelmed - with the unique style of film-making that I did not know even existed, with the images, but also with the very simplicity of the story and with the whole concept of surviving above everything else. Among the most devastating scenes for me was the old woman readily and happily accepting her turn to be taken to Narayma. The woman of perfect health and mind, the one who is perhaps the sanest in her family is so tired of this life that she on purpose knocks out one of her teeth just to seem older, more fragile, helpless, and ill and to be taken to the long -awaited rest. But before she is taken to Naryama, she will take care of her three grown sons' problems.

There are many unforgettable scenes in the film, both bleak and life-affirming. One stands out after all these years. There is a shining brilliant spring day, and every living creature in sight is engaged in love, young couple on the swing, birds, animals, and snakes - the whole nature celebrates life and longing and love. And soon after that, as the contrast, the horrifying scene where the family of thieves who had stolen some food from the neighbors are buried alive.

And there is the final part - the ascent to Narayama, the middle-aged son carries his mother to her final resting place, the last minutes between a son and his mother, and then, the snow in the end, white and pure, covering the earth and preparing it for the long sleep, and covering the old Orin, comforting her softly and preparing her for eternity...",1204761600,15,2607,4.347022587268994

This film deserves DVD release by Criterion.",1190246400,4,1193,4.605633802816901
525094,5,6302969565,"The 1983 Japanese film tells the story of 100 years ago, where a poor barbaric community survives, babies can be cast aside or sold.  One's life is more food needed and one's death means more food available.  Following a centuries-old tradition, as the elderly become 70 years, it is the role of the family, in this case a son,  to carry the parent on his back, up the mountain and left to die.

A son, Tatsuhei, vows not to be like his father, a coward who could not do his duty to carry his own father to the mountain when it was time.  When Tatsuhei's father lost his nerve, he disappeared and was disgraced.  Now, Tatsuhei battles with time as his mother's 70th is approaching.  She is the courageous one as the two follow the rules for the mountain journey.

In this film, director Inamura depicts this poor community well, their costumes, traditional customs, actions, and especially the look of the mountain, where toward the end, for about a half-hour, he takes the viewer on that slow, agonizing struggle up the mountain while encountering skeletons of others.

The film does have sex, nudity, and bestiality.  The use of various animals, stragetically placed reinforces our images how animal and humans relate and their connection to the earth.

This film is outstanding, but in its translation, the language used somehow doesn't fit the language actually spoken 100 years ago in a Japanese village.  To use the word ""sleep with"" for intercourse somehow is distracting and not language of the country and its era.

With many films to his credit, Director Shohei Inamura's more popular is Black Rain; it dealt with the fallout of the atomic bomb.  Ballad of Narayama is outstanding.

525095,4,6302969565,"""The Ballad of Narayama,"" by director Shohei Imamaura, is a very depressing and haunting film. But that is not to say the film is not a great film. The film deals with the harsh realities of life in a 19th Japanese village. This village is small, and more importantly hunger-stricken. The community concerns of survival outweigh the morality of those who must accept their deaths when they reach the age of 70. The villagers in this 19th-century Japanese village must adhere to a very strict policy regarding population control if they are to survive. And what does this mean? Well for starters, the elderly are sent to die near a mountain called Narayama when they reach the age of 70.

This is not a happy film, for the most part, yet the viewer must understand that the very survival of the villagers depend upon survival in its most extreme form. Stealing food in this village means instant death. Truly a disturbing film---yet we must not pass judgment, because for these villagers, their very lives depend on draconian measures. Because starvation is a chronic threat to the villagers, draconian measures must be adhered to. And in this village death is an accepted fact of life. The first time I viewed this film I was very depressed by it, however, viewing it again recently made me understand that these villagers must adhere to strict policies if they are to survive. It is too easy to pass judgment on there villagers: they must do what they can in order to survive. However, there is also humor in this film. But the rather sad fate of those who reach the age of 70, and must accept their death, makes one forget about the humorous parts [at least to me].

The cruel realities of this village are not lost on the viewer. And many may have a difficult time with this film. But it is at least worth a watch. [I own the VHS]. Although it is not one of those films one takes out too often for repeated viewings, it is one that everyone should view at least once. The film centers on the life of one elderly woman named Orin (Sumiko Sakamoto). She is now in her seventieth year of life, and must therefore prepare to die. Her son Tatsuhei (Ken Ogata) has the responsibility of taking his mother up to the base of Narayama to die. This is truly an unforgettable film. This self-sacrifice for the survival of the village will leave a lasting and searing image in your mind, especially as you view Orin about to face her inevitable death. This is not a film one soon forgets after viewing. This film is highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5]",1171152000,12,2539,4.565789473684211

The movie shows no mercy about that. The rules are very clear.when you are seventy ,you must go to Narayama.
We live in a world that avoids talking about this point.
James Hillman in an interview talks about the fact that in our process of growing up we do not want understand that to get it,we must lose things to reach it, and this is unboreable for many of us because we are accostumed to win always.
Watch a film called the sudden loneliness of Konrad Steiner from the swiss filmmaker Kurt Gloor, 1976 and then return to Narayama. Two different gazes, but basically facing the same question.
Since I was seventeen I read a thought from an italian writer-Giovanni Papini- who said:
Will I have to remember that the time is like an army of no shoes army who spies behind the door of every day of our life ,making us less strongs and much weaker?
Imamura is among that selected elite integrated by Mizoguchi, Kusorawa, Kinugasa, Ichikawa,Ozu.

Theft is not tolerated, and the old are left on a mountaintop to die from exposure.  This is a fascinating portrayal of how people are sometimes forced by their circumstances to be as merciless as nature itself.  It is easy to condemn many of the practices seen in this film, but we are forced to wonder how we might behave if we were similarly deprived.  To what extent is our ethics a product of our relatively luxurious lifestyle?  It is also interesting to see how various characters face their conditions--some retain their dignity and humanity, while others display what is most ugly and base in human nature.",1006819200,12,718,4.758064516129032

Rating = ***
Director:  Shouhei Imamura
DVD
1983

Film = solid three (3) stars; subtitles = four (4) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Shouhei Imamura's imaginative view of what life might have been like in a dirt-poor, isolated, small village during Japan's feudal era.  The film operates at two basic levels: entertainment and cultural analysis.  The Director introduces and nourishes a pretty full range of very fundamental human emotions and life conditions in this cinematic petri dish including superstitious behavior and sexual worship.  Acting is a bit on the hammy side and some scenes are too long.  The latter is especially the case for the sequence depicting the village's solution to the problem of an aging population:  haul/backpack healthy seniors to a distant mountain bone yard and leave them there to die from starvation and the elements.  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and set design are good given that exteriors seem to have been shot entirely on location (often in what seems to be five feet--or more--of snow).  The overly-long opening sequence shot from a helicopter, though, is a bit shaky.  Jump-cut editing can be sloppy with snow banks incredulously appearing in or disappearing from contiguous scenes.  Subtitles consist of two information streams: at the top of the screen appear thoughtful notes on culture and  language while the bottom presents reasonably edited translations of dialog (either or both streams can be turned off).  Score is sporadic but okay.  Interior scene lighting can be on the dim side.  Recommend viewing this gem a couple of times to discover all it has to offer.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.

7832545,4,6302969565,"Reading most of the reviews regarding this movie makes it clear that most of the viewers cannot remove themselves from their own reality and imagine what other lives there could have been in this world before present day value systems were established.

The first time I saw this movie I didn't know how to take it, but was immediately aware that the lives of the people depicted were at once unenviable at the worst extremes, and admirable at the other.

For whatever reasons these people have norms established which are hard to reconcile in today's reality, but aren't so far removed from our world as some might think on first impressions.

Now to address a couple of the complaints/assessments of the movie that are, at least in my opinion, off base.
1) Urinating is simply a normal function that used to be considered, well, normal. I understand the feelings of some who felt it was a disgusting cheap attempt at bringing the viewer to the gutter, but because of the way in which it was presented, simply as 'this too is part of life', have to say that the tone it was intended to set from the start was that this was a village not connected to any reality known by the modern viewer.
2) The villagers were less determining when to discard the old than the populace was simply adhering to their perception of the grim realities of life and holding to customs they themselves did not understand, yet still adhere to in the rugged struggle of life. Orin was vital and full of love for her family and community, which allowed her to look forward to giving her enduring strength back to her people and following the predetermined course of life.
3) Apparently most viewers missed the part of the movie where the Amaya family was removed from the population as a diseased fruit from the village, was where it was noted on the first visit in the night to them, that the father had been caught years earlier doing the exact same thing, and with the evidence presented when they examined the stolen edibles in their stores, determined that it was a blight that the family had running in their veins, and not likely to go away on its own. Whether fair or not to kill the whole lot is easy to consider from one's living room, but the realities in such a place were much different. For the people of this village who had to exist on their own labors, the Amaya's were stealing their lives, to view it from another perspective, and were not fostering habits of good neighbors.
4) One reviewer mentions defecation in public as having followed the earlier urination scene, but was not paying attention to the soundtrack which clearly depicts urination once again, not to mention that the English translation missed this fact which is pointed out in the original Japanese.

Movies of this sort are best viewed with neutral perspective and if one can learn to understand, completely separate from their own values of whether they approve or not, that many civilizations started out on the rocky soil of reality and only came to determinations as to what constitutes proper human behavior from the bottom up.

I have seen far more despicable examples of mankind in modern movies and for that matter, in the daily news, than is depicted here.",1366761600,,3230,4.659649122807018

7832548,2,6302969565,"There are many wonderful movies celebrating the courage, honor and spirit of the Japanese peasant in the face of overwhelming adversity. This is not one of them. Where to begin. Well, at the beginning, where we are treated to the bloated body of a dead child, left by its parents to rot in a rice paddy. This is followed by multiple variations on the same theme: patricide, matricide, and further infanticide. At least two innocent children are buried alive. Daughters are raised to be sold into slavery. There is a little self-mutilation. Add in some gleeful animal cruelty - beating a horse and bestiality with a dog, the latter intended as comic relief. The ""wise"" old matriarch of the central family intentionally, by trickery and without a shred of remorse, causes the murder of one son's pregnant ""wife."" This is a masterpiece? This depravity won the Palme d'Or? And don't tell me ""You just don't understand."" I understand it completely. I ""get"" it. One commenter at IMDB states ""See, feel, don't judge."" Are you kidding me? I saw it and I felt ashamed. I will grant that the acting job by Ken Ogata as the eldest son was terrific. His was the only character with an iota of conscience. And yes, the mountains and the snow were beautiful during the main title sequence and at the conclusion. However, they amounted to nothing more than fancy bookends for two hours of inhumanity and cruelty. No thanks. Give me Messrs. Ozu and Mizoguchi. Please.",1353974400,5,1451,4.761904761904762

7832551,1,6302969565,"Many people will associate the leading phrase ""the ballad of"" with the idea of something lyric and emotionally moving. With this movie, they would get the scatalogically grotesque. While in spots the cinematography is beautiful, the crudely explicit sex, the on-screen urination and defecation, the dead babies tossed into rice paddies, the sheer nastiness of the characters toward one another dramatically outweighs anything positive. There are times when I believe film festival awards go to such films because it seems trendy or edgy to glorify the obviously grotesque --and perhaps viewers and reviewers feel they are supporting boundary-pushing art when they are just supporting the puerile. The interspersing of cinematic nature shots in with the narrative seems without purpose -- perhaps it is supposed to introduce symbolism of some sort, but it just seems another way to get crude copulation into the movie. The story line has possibilities: the tensions of coping with a law that requires families to send their elders to the mountain of Narayama  at age 70 to die is wrought with emotional and narrative potential, but if I belonged to these families, I'd head there sooner just to get away from them. I like a broad range of films, from many different styles and approaches--I even teach university-level film courses. And I know that there are certainly other films (and film makers) who specialize in the disgusting (a few Italians pop to mind and I must admit I'm not a fan of them either), but I must agree with the fellow reviewer who sees this movie as a contender for the Top Ten Worst Film list. And it should be X-rated.",1339891200,4,1642,4.970909090909091
