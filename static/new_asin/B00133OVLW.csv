8249057,5,B00133OVLW,"This is one of the best teaching DVDs on the Old Testament I've ever seen!!!!
As an Old Testament instructor, I highly recommend this DVD and cannot think of a better DVD to teach your family, your children, and your church the main events of the Old Testament.

Who says learning the Old Testament isn't fun?? With this DVD it IS INDEED fun. The speaker starts with creation, goes through the entire book of Genesis, to Exodus and the wilderness wanderings, to the conquest at Jericho, through the United Kingdom, the divided kingdom, the Babylonian empire, and then and the Assyrian Empire, ending up with the 400 silent years between the Testaments.

All of this is easy to learn with creative hand signals, and can be communicated back to anyone in just under three minutes with the techniques utilized on this teaching DVD.

Buy this DVD, and enjoy the Old Testament.
