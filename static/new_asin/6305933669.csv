I tried to get through the whole movie, but just couldn't. The acting and dialogue are just too awful. There are the occasional glimmer of hope, that some positive message would be expressed shining out of the big pile of awfulness, but at the end of the day, it's still a big pile of awfulness. An hour in (that's as far as I got), there were perhaps all of two or three lines of dialogue that seemed meaningful enough for a movie that'd be worth watching.

The frat-house aspect of the movie is somewhat reminiscent of ""Animal House"", but without all the sophistication and class of that movie. There's also a bit of the ""fish out of water"" and ""under-estimated child"" themes, which in another movie could lead to some heart-warming moments.

Here, all I could think of was how much the kid in this movie -- ignored, abused, insufficiently educated, not given the chance to live up to his potential -- makes a great metaphor for the movie itself.

The film meets a basic production-value bar that keeps it from being the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. But at my most generous, I can only see it deserving two stars at best.",1389052800,,1148,4.558252427184466

7898300,4,6305933669,The Prodigy is one of those little known independent films that is both charming and thought provoking. The characters are real and believable if not always polished. The two main characters Tony anad Nathan are from two very different words but both share some common problems. In the end they become good friends and both of their lives are changed forever. This is a must see for anyone who believes in hope and the human spirit and for anyone who loves a happy ending. I plan to add this one to my personal library. I hope to see more of young Jeremy Isaiah Earl who played 13year old Nathan. Jeremy was a real stand out with his charm and wit and came across as very genuine in the role of Nathan.,1000166400,3,702,4.366412213740458
7898301,1,6305933669,"The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate, well-crafted independant film. Damn that opening shot for filling me hope. As the ""film"" progressed in a slow, plodding manner, my thoughts were varied in relation to this ""film"": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this ""film""? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this film in the Theatre! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a  Movie Theatre, because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college ""nerd"" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Other than that this ""film"" went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual uplifer. It succeeded on none of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.",990662400,3,991,4.475138121546961
7898302,4,6305933669,"I happened to be roaming around the new release rack of Blockbuster Video the other night when I stumbled across this little movie entitled ""The  Prodigy"".  I wasn't sure what to expect from the film as it had no  name actors, nor director, or anything like that.  I'd never even heard of  it to tell you the truth.  I read the back of the box and the plot sounded  decent so I decided to take a chance on it.  But I figured the odds were I  was renting a really bad B movie with a lot of TA and very little of  anything else.  (The film is unrated)  However, I watched the movie and was  quite surprised.  It was a delightful little film that warms your heart,  and at the same time, makes you think about some of the tragedies that  occur with our children here in the US on a daily basis.
The story is  what truly makes this movie. The acting, writing, direction, etc. are not  always up to par and is consistent with most really low budget films.  But  overall, these issues don't detract from the movie as a whole.  I really  liked the film.  In fact, I bought the DVD for my sister.",966816000,,1088,4.14975845410628
7898303,1,6305933669,"I was excited to watch this movie after reading the back of the box.  It makes the movie out to be provocative and powerful (re: abused ghetto child finds refuge in an all white frat house, they try to pass him off as a  genius in order for their frat to get off probation blah blah).  HOWEVER,  and this is a huge HOWEVER, the acting in this story is so bad, dialogue is  so cheezy... it's bad.  I kept re-writing the dialogue in my head and  re-casting the movie with better actors throught the movie.  I have to say  it honestly is THE WORST movie I have ever seen.  I watched it with two  other friends and we were laughing at how bad it was.  My brother tried to  watch it too, but he stopped it in the middle of it and rewound it because  it was so bad.  Whenever someone says they have seen a bad movie, me and my  friends always retaliate with, it wasn't as bad as The Prodigy.  It's not  even worth checking out how bad it is.  JUST TRUST ME!  If you want to  watch a powerful movie about how a poor, illiterate, black kid improves  with the help of the white man, I'm sure there are scores of them out  there.",948326400,4,1119,4.055299539170507
