3026839,3,B000YDMPBU,"I'll try to simply enumerate what I thought made this movie interesting and different in its approach from many, many others that have tried to present different parts of the story of Jesus Christ. I'll try to minimize spoilers as much as possible, because my purpose is not to give you my spin on the movie, with blow-by-blow descriptions, but rather to show you what's different and interesting about it.

It's different from anything else I've seen in this subject area because it starts out almost like a detective story, with a trusted Roman Commander and Tribune being sent from the battlefields of Germania over to Judea, where he has no idea of what's been going on. He's been sent expressly by the Roman Emperor Tiberius to investigate whether or not a Jewish martyr named Jesus resurrected himself after being crucified to death, or not.

Pontius Pilate, Saul of Tarsus (who would later become the Apostle Paul), and the High Priest of the Sandedrin, go to great lengths to convince the Tribune that the whole thing is a farce and a fraud. But the Tribune presses his investigation, and when presented with a corpse that Pilate has said is that of Jesus, the Tribune conducts his own postmortem analysis, concluding that it could not have been that of a man who had been killed by crucifixion, because the physical evidence for that conclusion simply was not there.

Then, in a clever pice de rsistance, Pilate and the High Priest put on a very convincing demonstration to disprove the report of Lazarus being raised from the dead, extrapolating the assumption of an identical fraud to the resurrection of Jesus.

This may sound like an interesting plot to you, but there are some disappointments and distractions. The acting and screenplay could have been better, and the directing could have been quite a bit better, too. There was really a lot of talent in this movie... particularly Max von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham, and Hristo Shopov (as Pilate, very much as he played the identical role in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"").
But the performances lacked the polish and finesse of ""Gladiator"", which Giulio Base, the Director of this movie, seemed intent on copying style, form, and mood from. Even the stylistic use of having sad, mysterious music in the soundtrack, much like ""Gladiator"", is used in ""Final Inquiry"", punctuated by a woman singing in an elegiac, acapella echoing style.

I would agree with others who have said that Dolph Lundgren gave a surprisingly strong performance that contributed to the movie. But by contrast, I couldn't really appeciate the director's rendition of the Caligula character, which was almost funny to watch because it was such a stereotype, again attempting to recall ""Gladiator"" scenes involving Commodus and Marcus Aurelius.

So, did I enjoy the movie -- yes, to a degree.  I could have enjoyed it a lot more if a more capable person had directed it, and if the focus could have stayed more on the track of an engaging detective story rather than with so much emphasis on the subplots that emerged during the latter half of the movie. You have seen much worse, but you have probably seen better also. With all it had going for it, this movie could have been exceptional, like the ""Gladiator"" movie the Director was so obviously intent on borrowing so much from....",1204243200,5,3329,4.850352112676056
3026840,5,B000YDMPBU,"The Final Inquiry was released in 2006 in Italy. It is only recently being released in the U.S. The cast, which includes Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate, Daniele Lioti as Tito Valerio (Lungren's master) Monica Cruz as Tabitha, and Vincenzo Bocciarelli as Caligola is convincing and very interesting to watch. However, Dolph Lungren (Brixos) once again steals the spotlight as a Hun turned into a Roman slave after he is captured.

The movie begins when an earthquake and solar eclips occur at the same time. Tito Valerio (Romes greatest general) is sent to investigate a possibe ressurection of Jesus Christ.

Dolph is 50 (at the time of this review in 2008). He still has youthful looks with a cut and muscular physique. His massive frame makes him the perfect candidate for the role of Brixos. It is refresshing to see Lungren explore different types of acting roles with different types of images.

Don't miss this movie!! The cast is great, the script is great, and my man Dolph Lungren is amazing!! I rate this movie with 5 stars!!",1204156800,19,1036,4.808988764044944
3026841,2,B000YDMPBU,"Some beautiful cinephotography is the best thing about this rather pedestrian retelling of the Easter story with a twist.

It is rather cliche ridden and far too clean for a dramatic realistic retelling. A rather sparkling Eurocast of actors with a rather good unexpectedly performance from Dolph Lundgren but in the final analysis there is not too much of substance to this movie.

I am sure that it will catch the moment just before Easter but it will probably be as quickly forgotten as a Cadbury Creme Egg.",1203206400,6,510,4.784090909090909
3026842,3,B000YDMPBU,"After mysterious events following the crucifixion of Jesus, Roman emperor Tiberius (Max von Sydow) sends Tito Valerio Tauro (Daniele Lotti) to investigate the supposed resurrection of Jesus. He doesn't get much cooperation from Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, who also played Pilate in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>""). He comes in contact with some of Jesus's followers and notice how faithful and peaceful they are.

The movie is well filmed (except for a few rather bad battle and fight sequences) and has a good cast. Dolph Lundgren plays Tauro's assistant/bodyguard. It is nice to see him in a different type of role but his character is a bit underdeveloped. Only towards the end of the movie do we get to know him slightly better. It would have been nice to see more of the interaction between him and Tauro throughout the movie. Vincenzo Bocciarelli, whom I've never heard of before, plays a gorgeous (and somewhat campy) Caligula and manages to steal his scenes from Max von Sydow. F. Murray Abraham also appears in a minor character.

The movie has a clear pro-Christian message and your appreciation of the movie will depend on your religious views. Personally I found the message in the ending to be a bit overstated (albeit expected). Recommended to fans of the stars, Christian viewers and fans of historical movies set in Jerusalem or the Roman Empire in general.",1203033600,48,1514,5.465811965811966

3026864,3,B000YDMPBU,"The Final Inquiry: a really interesting premise, that being of a post-crucifixion CSI style investigation done by the Romans attempting to prove that Jesus did not resurrect.  But after the investigation is done, it is quite obvious that He did indeed resurrect and that He is Risen.

But...Technically speaking, this is not a big budget production, even with some of the big names in the film:
(F. Murray Abraham, Penelope Cruz' sister Monica, Dolph Lundgren, Max von Sydow. Ironically it was Max von Sydow who played Jesus in the classic THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.)

So like ol' Clint Eastwood's  ""Spaghetti Westerns"", expect it to be a tad ""cheesy"" in places.
Don't expect THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.
 (Although Pontius Pilot is played by the SAME actor as in the Mel Gibson film!)
 It really has a ""made for TV movie"" feel, but that's okay because of its main message.

BUT...There is an ethical problem that still concerns me though:  this film has Mary Magdalene (Ornella Muti, FLASH GORDON 1980) advising St. Stephen to deny his faith while in prison so that he can live. I have NO idea why they pulled this on us. I understand that this is NOT a documentary, and that of course there is going to be some poetic license, but this is NOT the place to get creative.
Remember Jesus said (REV 2:10) ""...Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.""

The lead protagonist, Daniele Liotti, is very likeable in the role of the Roman who has the epiphany.

OK, so probably no Academy Awards here, but it makes us think about...and talk about... Praise the Lord.  kmb",1440547200,5,1613,4.644366197183099

The premise that close to death, Tiberius would launch an investigation into Jesus and that Caligula would then murder him and suppress the findings was well done. This is about politics-Roman.

3026875,4,B000YDMPBU,"With a host of stars including Actors - F. Murray Abraham and Max Von Sydow, this is a classic, epic, love story that comes about in two fold fashion. That being: The physical chemistry and true love between a man and a woman. And the other, a certain spiritual attraction. With the added bonus of a spiritual leader that went on to reveal the real truth and in so doing, changed the course of history. Handsome and very sexy - Tauro, a mighty, Roman Warrior is charged by the Roman Emperor to secretly infiltrate Jerusalem and find out if dead men, really do rise from the dead. Or so, Rome was told? But, some traditional and fearful minds are so obstinate, that even when the truth stares at them right in the face, they still... cling to antiquated, mental strongholds and out-dated, traditions. And, in the midst of all of this espionage and intrigue, Tauro unexpectedly finds true love and makes a fateful, life-changing, decision. Released in 2007 on a color, single-disc, DVD which is presented to it's audience in widescreen format, this 'Family Approved' movie is approximately 111-minutes long. THE FINAL INQUIRY is a good story that could have really happened. It's enlightening as well as, entertaining. A good movie, all the way around. Nina Kish",1428883200,,1260,4.811059907834101
3026876,5,B000YDMPBU,"I could not say it better or as well as Jay Citizen did in his review.  But I note anyway, the historical references were fascinating to me, I learned afterward in wikipedia that it is believed Tiberius was indeed favorably disposed toward the Jewish sect that believed Jesus was the Messiah.  I do not see it as a ""Christian"" movie.  Yes it is written by someone who believed the historical events showed no body found, but it is thought-provoking for anyone curious about the historical events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth.  That event was surely in fact investigated, the powers that be did in fact want to put an end to the movement, but no body could be found, and the people who said He had risen were unrelenting in their belief.  All the disciples except John died brutal martyrs' deaths without resistance because they were sure of what they had seen.  The movie is a compelling representation of the kind of activity that was surely occurring.  One thing not touched upon that I thought could have been, Pilate's wife did not appear to me in the movie sympathetic to the investigation, but in fact she had warned her husband to have nothing to do with the trial of this ""innocent man"".  I believe it is very Good News that if He is truly risen, and I believe He is, my sins, like those of the believers in the movie, are forgiven.",1427760000,,1360,4.545081967213115

3026878,5,B000YDMPBU,"This is, of course, HISTORICAL FICTION; based on the Christian history of post-crucifixion/resurrection Jerusalem and Rome; hence the inaccuracy of some of the movie.  This was a very good, enjoyable movie with some of the characters being genuine, but some of the characters (such as the three main characters); not. A good example is Tiberius the Emperor.  If you know anything about him, his history is nothing but evil, crazy actions and I doubt if he would care about  Jesus, his life or his death---or resurrection.  His character asking for the inquiry was needed to set up the story.  And Tabitha (main character) was never historically brought back to life by Peter (since she did not exist that we know of by the scriptures); but we do know that Peter and the other apostles did many miracles.  We also know that the Romans as well as the leaders of the Jewish leaders, wanted him dead....and Pilate existed. But would he have gone to any lengths at all to cover it up? At any rate, these were artistic freedoms for a brilliant story of how Jesus lived on. But the signs of the times were real and the plight of early Christians.  I love the very handsome Daniele Liotti--unfortunately an Italian actor that acts  in Italian language with subtitles.  I wish he would be in American movies , I must admit because he is so beautiful,(HA)  and is a wonderful actor. However, the story is a very enjoyable movie because it presents those times with a less documentary style than I have seen previously with some movies.  Those tragic times make all Christians be thankful for what they endured and the gift that Jesus was.",1427414400,,1628,4.697183098591549

3026914,2,B000YDMPBU,"Handsomely produced in Tunisia, with some respectable ""name"" actors in the cast, this well-intentioned mess wastes all its advantages on an astonishingly clumsy script riddled with absurd plot turns, gross historical anachronisms, and groan-inducing dialog.  The basic premise isn't bad, although it's a bit of a stretch historically:  an ailing emperor Tiberius sends a trusted investigator to Judea to look into the facts and rumors surrounding the trial and execution of Jesus of Nazareth.  But from there on, it's all down hill.  And the climax, in which a swishy Caligula murders his uncle Tiberius to keep him from issuing an edict making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, boggles the mind.

3026915,2,B000YDMPBU,"This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it's darned close. The writing is trite; the acting is wooden; the fight scenes are clumsily choreographed and tiresome to watch; and worst of all, the sound quality is abysmal...the dialogue  literally echoes off the soundstage walls. One funny moment from the film: the Roman ""investigator"" is standing before the three crosses at Calvary, and he asks which was the one Jesus was crucified on. Someone says the middle one, then the  camera pans up to a wooden plaque that clearly says ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" presumably in Latin. Duh. The most interesting thing about the movie is watching Dolph Lundgren not emote for roughly two hours. On the other hand, if you're a sucker for Roman/biblical spectacles like me, there are worse ways to squander 160 minutes of your life that you'll never get back... in a perverse, masochistic sort of way. And Monica Cruz IS cute as a bug. This movie may not convert many folk to a new-found religiousity, but I definitely can see it creating legions of new atheists.

3026916,3,B000YDMPBU,"Tabitha (Mnica Cruz) cannot find her parents one afternoon. The skies are darkening and there have been several earthquakes in the region, but she refuses to cease searching for them, stumbling through the crowded streets only to stop in horror at the sight of her mother crouched at the foot of the stoning wall. She has been caught in adultery with a Roman and must be killed, and Tabitha's Pharisee father (F. Murray Abraham) is the loudest of her accusers. As stones rain down on the helpless woman, Tabitha is dragged away screaming, only to have the crowd scatter as the earth trembles, a quake that reaches as far as the island of Capri where the Roman Emperor Tiberius (Max von Sydow) is spending the last years of his life. Curious as to the meaning behind these odd happenings, he sends word for his most trusted soldier to come to him at once.

Fighting for the preservation of Roman occupation of foreign territories, Tauro (Daniele Liotti) is surprised to be pulled from the heat of battle and sent to Jerusalem, a snake's pit of boiling political discontent and religious upheaval. He is on a secret mission to discover whether or not the Jewish Messiah known as Jesus has truly risen from the dead.  Though he travels without accompaniment apart from his servant Brixos (Dolph Lundgren), it is well known to Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) that a secret inquisitor has come to spy on his administration. While the two men wrangle from their positions of power and Tauro attempts to discern the truth by finding believers where he can and questioning them as to whether or not the body of their savior was moved from its resting place, he also meets and slowly begins to fall in love with Tabitha, who, unknown to her father, has decided to follow the Christian faith.

For the most part, this is a decent story and is surprisingly good despite the inadequate budget and awkward dubbing. It's so carefully done that it's hard to tell except in certain scenes, and yet the voices that Fox chose for the task are so far off the original actors that they sound too high pitched. Shopov in particular has a wonderfully deep and magnetic voice, and whoever dubbed him reminds me of a chipmunk. I wish Fox had offered alternative ways to view the film -- dubbed or in its original Spanish with subtitles, since the acting suffers somewhat as a result, as the voices were attempting to match the lip movements and sometimes this makes the dialogue stilted or slow. The fighting scenes are painfully staged and look fake and the dialogue is also at times woefully out of period. But the acting is good and the chemistry between Tabitha and Tauro is wonderful. It was fun for me to see so many faces and names brought forth from the Bible. We witness the capture, trial, and punishment of Stephen, as well as the callous behavior of Saul of Tarsus (one day to become Paul). Names like Lazarus and Judas are bandied about, but we are able to meet Mary, Simon Peter, Claudia Procula, and Caligula, played wonderfully by a scenery-chewing Vincenzo Bocciarelli.

The best portion of the film is in the last fifteen minutes, when he takes measures to obtain the throne of Rome and puts into motion the first measures of oppression against the Christians. Shopov is a somewhat more caustic Pilate this time around, and events do tend to stray slightly from historical and scriptural representations, but it maintains a good pace and throws in many surprises along the way. I did not expect several events in particular to transpire and at all times I was concerned for the characters' welfare. It is not a wonderful film by any means but it's entertaining.",1332374400,,3654,4.713615023474178

3026919,4,B000YDMPBU,"Good biblical films are hard to find. Most of them were made several decades ago. And even today we have splendid big-screen films like The Nativity Story and The Passion of the Christ. But it's difficult to find decent small-screen religious movies.

The Final Inquiry is an earnest Christian film that seems to be loosely based on the story of Tabitha (Acts 9:36-42) in the Bible. The ailing Roman emperor Tiberius (Max von Sydow) sends the soldier Titus Valerius Taurus (Daniele Liotti) to investigate the delicate issue of the missing body of an executed Galilean rabbi. Taurus is thwarted at every turn by wily Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, who played the same role in The Passion of the Christ).

To make matters worse for the harried Taurus, he finds himself falling in love with a lovely Jewish maiden named Tabitha (Monica Cruz). Tabitha has problems of her own: her mother is stoned to death for allegedly having an affair with a Roman, her father wants to marry her off to an old man, and on top of that she has to hide her new Christian faith. A romance between the two would be improbable, to say the least.

Cruz and Liotti manage to make such a romance not only probable but endearing. Tabitha practically glows, and Taurus is gallant and humorous, far more than hunky Roman eye candy. Several of the supporting characters are equally interesting, particularly Pilate, Taurus' German slave Brixas (Dolph Lundgren), and Tabitha's father (F. Murray Abraham).

Unfortunately, some of the other characters are cheesy and one-dimensional. This is a particular problem with the Jewish authorities. I seriously doubt any anti-Semitism was intended, but the actors paint their characters with such broad brushes that they come off as rather cartoonish.

To be fair, some of this probably has to do with the voices dubbed over most of the Italian actors' voices, presumably to make them easier to understand. Why not just hire actors people can understand in the first place?

The costumes and sets are gorgeous. They're very understated, as you might expect from a smaller film with a tight budget, but quite accurate based on what I know of the time period. Visually The Final Inquiry is very convincing, which helps make up for the film's other flaws.

The writers get big points for an original plotline that blends a fictional inquiry with a biblical story. It makes sense that Rome would make an inquiry into the matter of the missing body of a political criminal. What is less likely is that Emperor Tiberius would become attracted to Christianity.

Still, The Final Inquiry is a mostly solid film that is ideal for Christian teens and young adults in particular. It's difficult not to compare it to big-screen biblical films like The Passion of the Christ, especially since both films share a couple of the same actors. Don't short-change yourself by judging this one against standards it was never meant to conform to in the first place.",1303689600,2,2953,4.892
3026920,5,B000YDMPBU,"I am a Christian who also likes movies outside the purview of the Bible, but still based on good probability. If you want perfect realism, you are not going to get it in hollywood. I think many folks thought they were going to get another Da Vinci Code out of this movie; and don't understand Christian underpinnings at all.

Rather interestingly, I have studied some of the historians who were not Biblical from this event, and they do in fact write of the sun turning dark, and earthquakes occurring. One of them Africanus, even tore down the historical rumor that the darkness was caused by an eclipse, and even posed the scientific evidence that this could not be true. However the fact that the darkness was reported over a large part of the Roman/Greco world, and did happen, was not disputed.

The Romans were pretty sophisticated, and even had machines that helped determine the epicenter of earthquakes. It is very probable that certain inquiry was made into any thing that may have displeased the ""gods"" in Roman culture. They would not have discovered the Crucifixion incident until someone could travel to the area near the epicenter to find any event that fit their concept of an earth shattering event of human origin. They would have been looking for anything that hit the political radar down there to make a correlation. Only upon arrival would they make the connection to Christ's conviction and execution.

Tiberius was not your regular dictator, he actually despised Rome and preferred to rule from his villa near the shore, and even set out on a boat once during a political scuffle in Rome. A prefect of the area in Germania, he would have had many friends in the army up there, so his ties to the investigator make sense for a story line. With his tendency toward thought instead of conquest and politic, I can imagine a man that would have been curious about anything as odious as natural signs of wrath of the gods.

Many of the ""facts"" brought up in the investigation were written at least 3 hundred years later in the apocrypha 'Acts of Pilate' which are understood by almost all scholars as simple popular whimsical writings of faith disseminated by writers just trying to put out a good story. However, I'm sure they had at least a tinge of fact based on old traditions in the Church of the first centuries AD. Historical data retrieved in 1961 led to information that Pilate probably committed suicide in Gaul, as his fortunes turned for the worse in Caligula's rule. Besides, he probably didn't get much credit once the Romans had to burn Jerusalem to the ground and kill almost every Jew in sight. Failed rulers are not favored in Rome.

I found the movie stimulating, and immediately began scurrying about to find if any of the characters were factual names of history, and could be researched to verify that they actually lived at the same time. Just verifying that was amazing, as the video industry rarely bothers themselves with any thing of an ""investigative"" nature. In fact the name of the movie is a contradiction to most anything of documentary flavor in the TV & Movie industry.",1295827200,23,3121,4.740331491712707

3026923,2,B000YDMPBU,"I must preface this review by saying that I really like Christian productions--if they are well done. This one, unfortunately, was not. I think it was about an hour in that the proselyte Jewish girl proclaimed to the Roman that she had never touched a man before, and then they proceed to a slobbery long kiss--including visible saliva!

Besides that aspect (which was rather disturbing on a number of different levels), there was cheese to degrees that almost makes a pizza taste bad. The aforementioned girl gets clubbed on the head about 10 times with a wooden cane and is dying, yet she doesn't have one bruise or blood spot on her head, and she is lucid when she speaks. (Of course, she is also raised from the dead by Peter.)

Seriously, this was a very nice-looking film, but the script and story were awful. Unfortunately, the true awfulness didn't start until after an hour in when I was already committed. At that point we started to crack jokes, and it was only that which enabled me to see it to the end and not completely regret watching one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.

Dolph needs to be the lead in any movie he's in.  It doesn't work otherwise, except in Rocky IV.  The fact that his character didn't even have any personality didn't help either.

3026936,3,B000YDMPBU,"Synopsis: The '07 release `The Final Inquiry' is a watchable, though not fully engaging exploration into the mystery of the resurrection as embodied in a fictional tale concerning a Roman emissary,Tito Valerio Tauro (Daniele Liotti) and his mission to the Holy Land to locate the missing body of Jesus of Nazareth.

After arriving at his destination the search for the truth begins as Tito questions all the appropriate people about the events of the crucifixcion and the three days that followed: Pontius Pilate and his wife, Saul of Tarsus, Longinous (the Roman soldier who stuck his spear into Jesus as he hung on the cross), the apostle Peter and of course Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

During his stay in the Holy Land the young Roman also finds something unexpected, he falls in love with a beautiful young Jewish girl and follower of Christ named Tabitha (Monica Cruz).Her love helps to awaken the staunch pagan to a new belief and a new beginning.

Critique: `The Final Inquiry' attempts to fit into the Biblical epic mold made so popular in the 50's, coming away with mixed results. The acting is noticeably stiff here and there and at moments comes across as one of those documentaries with live-action re-enactments rather than a feature film.

Along the same line of reasoning, the soundtrack falls well short of capturing the romanticism and angst of the music it attempts to emulate. While it does succeed in enhancing the on-screen events it isn't particularly memorable on its own.

F. Murray Abraham has a small part and is excellent as always and the legendary Max von Sydow makes several appearances on-screen in the role of Emperor Tiberius. The rest of the cast of lesser knowns do an adequate job of interpreting the first century A.D. events surrounding the death and resurrection of the Messiah so it should find a appreciative following within the Christian community.

Personal Observation: The role of Mary, Mother of Jesus was played by Maria Pia Calzone. Though she never spoke there was something mesmerizing about her gaze and countenance. I would have liked to see more time spent on developing her character and persona. The same applies to Vincenzo Bocciarelli in the role of the young Caligula. He appears briefly at the end of the film but he captures the essence of the mad Emperor-to-be perfectly.

3026958,3,B000YDMPBU,"This movie has a different take on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The emperor Tiberius Caesar dispatches a tribune, Titus Valierius Tauros (Daniele Liotti) to investigate the possibility of Jesus' resurrection. During his investigation, he crosses paths with the major characters in the Gospels and Acts and concludes the resurrection did in fact happen. Several well known (at least to me) actors appear in the movie: Max Von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham, and Dolph Lundgren.

I would have enjoyed a bit more CSI flavor in Tauros' investigation, turning it more into an entertaining way to present information like Frank Morrison's Who Moved the Stone? Perhaps an intellectual companion along the lines of William of Baskerville in The Name of the Rose or Edith Pargeter's Brother Cadfael would drive the investigation forward not only through a 1st century version of a forensic investigation but also through the interaction between a Roman man of action and a 1st century man of thought similar to the interaction between Jack Aubrey and Dr. Maturin in Master and Commander.

The ending left me a bit cold. Tiberius, upon receiving Tauros' report, resolves to prevail on the Senate to move to stop persecution of the Christians. However, his son, Caligula, realizing that could undermine the ideology of the emperor's divinity, assassinates Tiberius and has Tauros' report burned.

A more interesting ending could have shown Tiberius contemplating the implications of Tauros' report, deciding it wasn't in the best interests of the empire, and then being killed by his son. That would have produced a more ironic comment on the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of man.

3026961,4,B000YDMPBU,"I saw this on TBN a few nights ago, and found it exceeded my expectations.  As a lawyer, I was drawn to it partially because of how it presented the truth or falsity of Jesus' Resurrection from the dead more or less as a type of ""grand jury"" inquiry, which, I believe, was exactly why the movie was named as it was.  No grand miracles were provided, except for one healing toward the end of the picture, which serves to heal the protagonist's love interest, and, in so doing, show that the skeptic's usual denials that Jesus rose from death to life again are false.  God can and does provide true life after death.
  As for the ""inquiry"" which follows, regarding the resurrection:  first, the movie showed a scene where supposed disciples ""stole"" His body and tried to carry it away to re-bury it, thereby leading to the story that He didn't rise again, and everything that led from it thereafter was a lie.  But, Titus finds that the supposed Christ body was not His; instead, the wounds supposedly made upon crucifixion were done after death.  Also,the supposed 'disciples' he slew in finding the body were hired gladiators, obviously in the employ of Pilate.  Next, they show, by ""re-enacting"" the raising of Lazarus via an unexpecting Titus, who was the one drugged, how a person can be drugged to simulate death and then awaken after several days. It is argued that both the raising of Lazarus and Christ's resurrection would then be no more than magical ""tricks"" to fool the populace into belief in Jesus.  Titus believes that, until he finds out that a miracle CAN happen, but that takes place later.  Third, they show that the Romans who were present at Jesus' death could and were pressured into falsely saying that He didn't die on Good Friday, so as to lead to the drugged-state-of-false-death version.  But, Longinus, who was the Centurion in charge at the crucifixion, while being pressured by Pilate, maintains to Titus that he, himself, knew Jesus was dead before he threw his lance into Jesus' side.  Each possibility is then shown to be false.  So, no one could have drugged Jesus, and any disappearance of His body would then have to be either by stealing it or by His Resurrection. Finally, after first believing in the ""drugging theory"", Titus finds that miracles can and do happen when God, in the person of Peter the Apostle, intervenes and restores Titus' love interest to life after she, who had suffered an apparent head injury and died.  Titus then concludes that the ancient Roman gods and goddesses are creations of man, and the God of Jesus is real, and that peace and love are the best ways to live.  He recommends that Tiberius place his faith in Jesus' Resurrection, and leaves his post as a Roman officer to live with his lady-love.  Although Caligula, who kills Tiberius, sends orders for Titus' assassination, boy gets girl, and both live happily(we hope) ever after.
  So much for the plot line.  But there are other good things to mention.  Another good feature of this movie was a view of Jesus' antagonists i.e., the persons who didn't want to let Jesus' Resurrection to become known and how they would have been acting after His supposed Resurrection.  The Sanhedrin, i.e., the Jewish hierarchy,  among whom was a person then known as ""Saul of Tarsus""(later to become a great Christian apostle known as Paul), was at that time acting to suppress the early Christians, intervened when they learned that Rome had sent a fact-finder to Jerusalem and tried their best, with Pilate's cooperation, to make Titus see that the whole story about the Resurrection had been made up by the disciples.  They were very active in trying to stamp out the Christian cult before it grew, and so when a disciple(Saint Stephen, ""the first martyr"") was caught, he was stoned to death.  Meanwhile, Pilate, the Roman Procurator, didn't want Rome to meddle in his affairs, and also tried to either kill Titus or convince him that the whole story of Jesus' rising was false, invented by the disciples.
  I found the acting credible. I wasn't looking for an Academy Award type performance in this picture, as the purpose was obvious at the outset, i.e., to provide uplifting faith-based fare for Christians and to provide a first hand look at how any real official inquiry may have been conducted, with all the Biblical characters present, had any inquiry been ordered.  The outcome, i.e., that Tiberius would order the Empire to become Christian, was, in my mind,unbelievable.  The historical Tiberius wasn't the man protrayed in the movie, looking for life after death.  Also, it seems too improbably that Tiberius would ever simply rely upon the report of one man, who had become romantically and personally involved, and then change the entire Classical god and goddess system that the Empire had been using and re-distribute the property of all the Empire, and destroy the slave-and-master system of owning persons to do the manual labor of the Empire, then in existence.  So, Caligula, in life a cruel and insane man, fills the role in this movie of restoring us to the history we know, by killing Tiberius(borrowing, possibly, from the killing of Marcus Aurelius by his son, Commodus, in Gladiator?).  The romance was done well, although I thought there was not enough time to develop the romance well enough especially since the two lovers were so different, and her contract marriage was not dealt with in a believable way.  Nevertheless, the two actors were good looking, and did their lines and scenes believably, and we know that Cupid's arrow can shoot at anyone, ergo, why not a Roman Tribune and a Hebrew upper-class Teenager?
  So, for believers, it was a good two hour view; for nonbelievers, it was probably a waste of time, but it wasn't aimed toward nonbelievers anyway.  I'd watch it again, and my wife also likes it.",1206230400,13,5852,4.811188811188811

3026964,2,B000YDMPBU,"I saw a film a couple of years ago with the same premise.  Not being made by Christians it was less than fulfilling spiritually. While this film was made from a genuine Christian slant, the production elements were less than satisfactory.
This is like a second-rate THE ROBE.  In fact there are many similarities from a Roman Tribune looking for truth to his trusty sidekick and Peter healing a woman.  Of course that film had Richard Burton...this one doesn't.  I couldn't believe F. Murray Abraham's performance.  This guy won an Oscar?!!?  And Dolph Lundgren...who knows?  His dialogue was so stilted, I started longing for the atrocious dialogue of the lastest STAR WARS movies, but that isn't really his fault. And I had to put my foot down with the Caligula homage to GLADIATOR.  First of all we never hear about Caligula until the very end and he comes in looking like an actor from a Silent Film...blaring eyes and overdone body movements...reminded me of Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BLVD.
I will say this. The costumes were spectacular.  And I really liked the flashbacks with Jesus.  And I also liked the guy playing Peter. I've never seen him played just that way and I really liked it.  I also liked the tying together of Saul and Stephen.  Very nice idea.
This was a good idea for a film but like most Christian films, it falls short of the mark.  It's a shame because I personally think films about God deserve the VERY BEST.  Maybe someday Hollywood will catch on.  Hey Hollywood, there's plenty of Christians that will see these movies if you make them right or didn't you hear about the millions PASSION OF THE CHRIST made.  I know you're all about money and frankly we're willing to part with it...we just want some quality with our spirituality. Not too much to ask, is it?",1205366400,11,1789,4.649681528662421
3026965,3,B000YDMPBU,"'The Final Inquiry"" is an Italian film that was made in English, but got dubbed over again [to cover the accents I presume] and is set during the Roman Empire, circa 33 AD. A series of earthquakes on a particular day that is felt around the world sets the Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar [Max Von Sydow] to command one of his tribunes Titus Valerius Taurus [Daniel Loggia] to go to Jerusalem, where the Emperor believes the crucifixion of a certain Jesus from the province of Judea and the resurrection rumors surrounding him is reponsible for the events.

Tribune Titus goes off to Jerusalem with a slave captured in fighting, a germanic warrior Brixas [Dolph Lundgren] and they encounter a group of people called the Nazarenes, who carry on the teachings of Jesus, in spite of persecution. They also meet Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who finds Titus' inquiry into the whereabouts of Jesus' body a threat to his authority.

Besides the search for answers as to how Jesus died, and what happened to his body afterwards, and the greater question of whether he was truly resurrected [Pilate and the Pharisees go to great lengths to try and disprove the resurrection theory], the other main plot centers around the romance that develops between Titus and a Nazarene, Tabitha and their love story holds the film together. Their chemistry is palbable [yes, its a Biblical story, yet the interplay of dialogue and emotion between these two is credibly done]. Titus finds himself drawn, despite his skepticism, to the noble manner in which the Nazarenes carry themselves, and a tragedy followed by a miracle causes him to question his own lack of faith.

Though this is not ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", it is a decently-made Biblical movie. The sets are quite convincing [I think the movie itself was shot in Tunisia] and the acting, though far from great, is credible. Dolph Lundgren as the slave warrior is quite convincing in his role, and the actors portraying Titus and Tabitha are credible too, as is the actor playing Pontius Pilate [who also portrayed pilate in The Passion of Christ]. For a hammy performance, look out for the actor portraying Caligula.

Final verdict - a pleasantly watchable Biblical movie, but if your expectations are high, you may want to skip this one.",1205020800,17,2284,4.878865979381444

3261336,3,B000YDMPBU,"I'll try to simply enumerate what I thought made this movie interesting and different in its approach from many, many others that have tried to present different parts of the story of Jesus Christ. I'll try to minimize spoilers as much as possible, because my purpose is not to give you my spin on the movie, with blow-by-blow descriptions, but rather to show you what's different and interesting about it.

It's different from anything else I've seen in this subject area because it starts out almost like a detective story, with a trusted Roman Commander and Tribune being sent from the battlefields of Germania over to Judea, where he has no idea of what's been going on. He's been sent expressly by the Roman Emperor Tiberius to investigate whether or not a Jewish martyr named Jesus resurrected himself after being crucified to death, or not.

Pontius Pilate, Saul of Tarsus (who would later become the Apostle Paul), and the High Priest of the Sandedrin, go to great lengths to convince the Tribune that the whole thing is a farce and a fraud. But the Tribune presses his investigation, and when presented with a corpse that Pilate has said is that of Jesus, the Tribune conducts his own postmortem analysis, concluding that it could not have been that of a man who had been killed by crucifixion, because the physical evidence for that conclusion simply was not there.

Then, in a clever pice de rsistance, Pilate and the High Priest put on a very convincing demonstration to disprove the report of Lazarus being raised from the dead, extrapolating the assumption of an identical fraud to the resurrection of Jesus.

This may sound like an interesting plot to you, but there are some disappointments and distractions. The acting and screenplay could have been better, and the directing could have been quite a bit better, too. There was really a lot of talent in this movie... particularly Max von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham, and Hristo Shopov (as Pilate, very much as he played the identical role in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"").
But the performances lacked the polish and finesse of ""Gladiator"", which Giulio Base, the Director of this movie, seemed intent on copying style, form, and mood from. Even the stylistic use of having sad, mysterious music in the soundtrack, much like ""Gladiator"", is used in ""Final Inquiry"", punctuated by a woman singing in an elegiac, acapella echoing style.

I would agree with others who have said that Dolph Lundgren gave a surprisingly strong performance that contributed to the movie. But by contrast, I couldn't really appeciate the director's rendition of the Caligula character, which was almost funny to watch because it was such a stereotype, again attempting to recall ""Gladiator"" scenes involving Commodus and Marcus Aurelius.

So, did I enjoy the movie -- yes, to a degree.  I could have enjoyed it a lot more if a more capable person had directed it, and if the focus could have stayed more on the track of an engaging detective story rather than with so much emphasis on the subplots that emerged during the latter half of the movie. You have seen much worse, but you have probably seen better also. With all it had going for it, this movie could have been exceptional, like the ""Gladiator"" movie the Director was so obviously intent on borrowing so much from....",1204243200,5,3329,4.850352112676056
3261337,5,B000YDMPBU,"The Final Inquiry was released in 2006 in Italy. It is only recently being released in the U.S. The cast, which includes Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate, Daniele Lioti as Tito Valerio (Lungren's master) Monica Cruz as Tabitha, and Vincenzo Bocciarelli as Caligola is convincing and very interesting to watch. However, Dolph Lungren (Brixos) once again steals the spotlight as a Hun turned into a Roman slave after he is captured.

The movie begins when an earthquake and solar eclips occur at the same time. Tito Valerio (Romes greatest general) is sent to investigate a possibe ressurection of Jesus Christ.

Dolph is 50 (at the time of this review in 2008). He still has youthful looks with a cut and muscular physique. His massive frame makes him the perfect candidate for the role of Brixos. It is refresshing to see Lungren explore different types of acting roles with different types of images.

3261339,3,B000YDMPBU,"After mysterious events following the crucifixion of Jesus, Roman emperor Tiberius (Max von Sydow) sends Tito Valerio Tauro (Daniele Lotti) to investigate the supposed resurrection of Jesus. He doesn't get much cooperation from Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, who also played Pilate in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>""). He comes in contact with some of Jesus's followers and notice how faithful and peaceful they are.

The movie is well filmed (except for a few rather bad battle and fight sequences) and has a good cast. Dolph Lundgren plays Tauro's assistant/bodyguard. It is nice to see him in a different type of role but his character is a bit underdeveloped. Only towards the end of the movie do we get to know him slightly better. It would have been nice to see more of the interaction between him and Tauro throughout the movie. Vincenzo Bocciarelli, whom I've never heard of before, plays a gorgeous (and somewhat campy) Caligula and manages to steal his scenes from Max von Sydow. F. Murray Abraham also appears in a minor character.

The movie has a clear pro-Christian message and your appreciation of the movie will depend on your religious views. Personally I found the message in the ending to be a bit overstated (albeit expected).

But after the investigation is done, it is quite obvious that He did indeed resurrect and that He is Risen.

But...Technically speaking, this is not a big budget production, even with some of the big names in the film:
(F. Murray Abraham, Penelope Cruz' sister Monica, Dolph Lundgren, Max von Sydow. Ironically it was Max von Sydow who played Jesus in the classic THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.)

So like ol' Clint Eastwood's  ""Spaghetti Westerns"", expect it to be a tad ""cheesy"" in places.
Don't expect THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.
 (Although Pontius Pilot is played by the SAME actor as in the Mel Gibson film!)
 It really has a ""made for TV movie"" feel, but that's okay because of its main message.

BUT...There is an ethical problem that still concerns me though:  this film has Mary Magdalene (Ornella Muti, FLASH GORDON 1980) advising St. Stephen to deny his faith while in prison so that he can live. I have NO idea why they pulled this on us. I understand that this is NOT a documentary, and that of course there is going to be some poetic license, but this is NOT the place to get creative.
Remember Jesus said (REV 2:10) ""...Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.""

I do not see it as a ""Christian"" movie.  Yes it is written by someone who believed the historical events showed no body found, but it is thought-provoking for anyone curious about the historical events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth.  That event was surely in fact investigated, the powers that be did in fact want to put an end to the movement, but no body could be found, and the people who said He had risen were unrelenting in their belief.  All the disciples except John died brutal martyrs' deaths without resistance because they were sure of what they had seen.  The movie is a compelling representation of the kind of activity that was surely occurring.  One thing not touched upon that I thought could have been, Pilate's wife did not appear to me in the movie sympathetic to the investigation, but in fact she had warned her husband to have nothing to do with the trial of this ""innocent man"".

This was a very good, enjoyable movie with some of the characters being genuine, but some of the characters (such as the three main characters); not. A good example is Tiberius the Emperor.  If you know anything about him, his history is nothing but evil, crazy actions and I doubt if he would care about  Jesus, his life or his death---or resurrection.  His character asking for the inquiry was needed to set up the story.  And Tabitha (main character) was never historically brought back to life by Peter (since she did not exist that we know of by the scriptures); but we do know that Peter and the other apostles did many miracles.  We also know that the Romans as well as the leaders of the Jewish leaders, wanted him dead....and Pilate existed. But would he have gone to any lengths at all to cover it up? At any rate, these were artistic freedoms for a brilliant story of how Jesus lived on. But the signs of the times were real and the plight of early Christians.  I love the very handsome Daniele Liotti--unfortunately an Italian actor that acts  in Italian language with subtitles.  I wish he would be in American movies , I must admit because he is so beautiful,(HA)  and is a wonderful actor.

But from there on, it's all down hill.  And the climax, in which a swishy Caligula murders his uncle Tiberius to keep him from issuing an edict making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, boggles the mind.

The writing is trite; the acting is wooden; the fight scenes are clumsily choreographed and tiresome to watch; and worst of all, the sound quality is abysmal...the dialogue  literally echoes off the soundstage walls. One funny moment from the film: the Roman ""investigator"" is standing before the three crosses at Calvary, and he asks which was the one Jesus was crucified on. Someone says the middle one, then the  camera pans up to a wooden plaque that clearly says ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" presumably in Latin. Duh. The most interesting thing about the movie is watching Dolph Lundgren not emote for roughly two hours. On the other hand, if you're a sucker for Roman/biblical spectacles like me, there are worse ways to squander 160 minutes of your life that you'll never get back... in a perverse, masochistic sort of way.

3261413,3,B000YDMPBU,"Tabitha (Mnica Cruz) cannot find her parents one afternoon. The skies are darkening and there have been several earthquakes in the region, but she refuses to cease searching for them, stumbling through the crowded streets only to stop in horror at the sight of her mother crouched at the foot of the stoning wall. She has been caught in adultery with a Roman and must be killed, and Tabitha's Pharisee father (F. Murray Abraham) is the loudest of her accusers. As stones rain down on the helpless woman, Tabitha is dragged away screaming, only to have the crowd scatter as the earth trembles, a quake that reaches as far as the island of Capri where the Roman Emperor Tiberius (Max von Sydow) is spending the last years of his life. Curious as to the meaning behind these odd happenings, he sends word for his most trusted soldier to come to him at once.

Fighting for the preservation of Roman occupation of foreign territories, Tauro (Daniele Liotti) is surprised to be pulled from the heat of battle and sent to Jerusalem, a snake's pit of boiling political discontent and religious upheaval. He is on a secret mission to discover whether or not the Jewish Messiah known as Jesus has truly risen from the dead.  Though he travels without accompaniment apart from his servant Brixos (Dolph Lundgren), it is well known to Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) that a secret inquisitor has come to spy on his administration. While the two men wrangle from their positions of power and Tauro attempts to discern the truth by finding believers where he can and questioning them as to whether or not the body of their savior was moved from its resting place, he also meets and slowly begins to fall in love with Tabitha, who, unknown to her father, has decided to follow the Christian faith.

For the most part, this is a decent story and is surprisingly good despite the inadequate budget and awkward dubbing. It's so carefully done that it's hard to tell except in certain scenes, and yet the voices that Fox chose for the task are so far off the original actors that they sound too high pitched. Shopov in particular has a wonderfully deep and magnetic voice, and whoever dubbed him reminds me of a chipmunk. I wish Fox had offered alternative ways to view the film -- dubbed or in its original Spanish with subtitles, since the acting suffers somewhat as a result, as the voices were attempting to match the lip movements and sometimes this makes the dialogue stilted or slow. The fighting scenes are painfully staged and look fake and the dialogue is also at times woefully out of period. But the acting is good and the chemistry between Tabitha and Tauro is wonderful. It was fun for me to see so many faces and names brought forth from the Bible. We witness the capture, trial, and punishment of Stephen, as well as the callous behavior of Saul of Tarsus (one day to become Paul). Names like Lazarus and Judas are bandied about, but we are able to meet Mary, Simon Peter, Claudia Procula, and Caligula, played wonderfully by a scenery-chewing Vincenzo Bocciarelli.

The best portion of the film is in the last fifteen minutes, when he takes measures to obtain the throne of Rome and puts into motion the first measures of oppression against the Christians. Shopov is a somewhat more caustic Pilate this time around, and events do tend to stray slightly from historical and scriptural representations, but it maintains a good pace and throws in many surprises along the way. I did not expect several events in particular to transpire and at all times I was concerned for the characters' welfare. It is not a wonderful film by any means but it's entertaining.",1332374400,,3654,4.713615023474178

3261416,4,B000YDMPBU,"Good biblical films are hard to find. Most of them were made several decades ago. And even today we have splendid big-screen films like The Nativity Story and The Passion of the Christ. But it's difficult to find decent small-screen religious movies.

The Final Inquiry is an earnest Christian film that seems to be loosely based on the story of Tabitha (Acts 9:36-42) in the Bible. The ailing Roman emperor Tiberius (Max von Sydow) sends the soldier Titus Valerius Taurus (Daniele Liotti) to investigate the delicate issue of the missing body of an executed Galilean rabbi. Taurus is thwarted at every turn by wily Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, who played the same role in The Passion of the Christ).

To make matters worse for the harried Taurus, he finds himself falling in love with a lovely Jewish maiden named Tabitha (Monica Cruz). Tabitha has problems of her own: her mother is stoned to death for allegedly having an affair with a Roman, her father wants to marry her off to an old man, and on top of that she has to hide her new Christian faith. A romance between the two would be improbable, to say the least.

Cruz and Liotti manage to make such a romance not only probable but endearing. Tabitha practically glows, and Taurus is gallant and humorous, far more than hunky Roman eye candy. Several of the supporting characters are equally interesting, particularly Pilate, Taurus' German slave Brixas (Dolph Lundgren), and Tabitha's father (F. Murray Abraham).

Unfortunately, some of the other characters are cheesy and one-dimensional. This is a particular problem with the Jewish authorities. I seriously doubt any anti-Semitism was intended, but the actors paint their characters with such broad brushes that they come off as rather cartoonish.

To be fair, some of this probably has to do with the voices dubbed over most of the Italian actors' voices, presumably to make them easier to understand. Why not just hire actors people can understand in the first place?

The costumes and sets are gorgeous. They're very understated, as you might expect from a smaller film with a tight budget, but quite accurate based on what I know of the time period. Visually The Final Inquiry is very convincing, which helps make up for the film's other flaws.

The writers get big points for an original plotline that blends a fictional inquiry with a biblical story. It makes sense that Rome would make an inquiry into the matter of the missing body of a political criminal. What is less likely is that Emperor Tiberius would become attracted to Christianity.

Still, The Final Inquiry is a mostly solid film that is ideal for Christian teens and young adults in particular. It's difficult not to compare it to big-screen biblical films like The Passion of the Christ, especially since both films share a couple of the same actors. Don't short-change yourself by judging this one against standards it was never meant to conform to in the first place.",1303689600,2,2953,4.892
3261417,5,B000YDMPBU,"I am a Christian who also likes movies outside the purview of the Bible, but still based on good probability. If you want perfect realism, you are not going to get it in hollywood. I think many folks thought they were going to get another Da Vinci Code out of this movie; and don't understand Christian underpinnings at all.

Rather interestingly, I have studied some of the historians who were not Biblical from this event, and they do in fact write of the sun turning dark, and earthquakes occurring. One of them Africanus, even tore down the historical rumor that the darkness was caused by an eclipse, and even posed the scientific evidence that this could not be true. However the fact that the darkness was reported over a large part of the Roman/Greco world, and did happen, was not disputed.

The Romans were pretty sophisticated, and even had machines that helped determine the epicenter of earthquakes. It is very probable that certain inquiry was made into any thing that may have displeased the ""gods"" in Roman culture. They would not have discovered the Crucifixion incident until someone could travel to the area near the epicenter to find any event that fit their concept of an earth shattering event of human origin. They would have been looking for anything that hit the political radar down there to make a correlation. Only upon arrival would they make the connection to Christ's conviction and execution.

Tiberius was not your regular dictator, he actually despised Rome and preferred to rule from his villa near the shore, and even set out on a boat once during a political scuffle in Rome. A prefect of the area in Germania, he would have had many friends in the army up there, so his ties to the investigator make sense for a story line. With his tendency toward thought instead of conquest and politic, I can imagine a man that would have been curious about anything as odious as natural signs of wrath of the gods.

Many of the ""facts"" brought up in the investigation were written at least 3 hundred years later in the apocrypha 'Acts of Pilate' which are understood by almost all scholars as simple popular whimsical writings of faith disseminated by writers just trying to put out a good story. However, I'm sure they had at least a tinge of fact based on old traditions in the Church of the first centuries AD. Historical data retrieved in 1961 led to information that Pilate probably committed suicide in Gaul, as his fortunes turned for the worse in Caligula's rule. Besides, he probably didn't get much credit once the Romans had to burn Jerusalem to the ground and kill almost every Jew in sight. Failed rulers are not favored in Rome.

I found the movie stimulating, and immediately began scurrying about to find if any of the characters were factual names of history, and could be researched to verify that they actually lived at the same time. Just verifying that was amazing, as the video industry rarely bothers themselves with any thing of an ""investigative"" nature. In fact the name of the movie is a contradiction to most anything of documentary flavor in the TV & Movie industry.",1295827200,23,3121,4.740331491712707

""It is simple,"" he answered, ""I just change the story that I insert into the sermon."" It is the same with this film.

3261420,2,B000YDMPBU,"I must preface this review by saying that I really like Christian productions--if they are well done. This one, unfortunately, was not. I think it was about an hour in that the proselyte Jewish girl proclaimed to the Roman that she had never touched a man before, and then they proceed to a slobbery long kiss--including visible saliva!

Besides that aspect (which was rather disturbing on a number of different levels), there was cheese to degrees that almost makes a pizza taste bad. The aforementioned girl gets clubbed on the head about 10 times with a wooden cane and is dying, yet she doesn't have one bruise or blood spot on her head, and she is lucid when she speaks. (Of course, she is also raised from the dead by Peter.)

Seriously, this was a very nice-looking film, but the script and story were awful. Unfortunately, the true awfulness didn't start until after an hour in when I was already committed. At that point we started to crack jokes, and it was only that which enabled me to see it to the end and not completely regret watching one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.

Tito Valerio Tauro, and his trusted slave, a German warrior, who was once a enemy of Rome, go on this secret misson to Jerusalem to discover the truth, and along the way they find deceit, and treachery, in the form of Pontius Pilate, and his crooked priests, and informants!

Dolph needs to be the lead in any movie he's in.  It doesn't work otherwise, except in Rocky IV.  The fact that his character didn't even have any personality didn't help either.

3261433,3,B000YDMPBU,"Synopsis: The '07 release `The Final Inquiry' is a watchable, though not fully engaging exploration into the mystery of the resurrection as embodied in a fictional tale concerning a Roman emissary,Tito Valerio Tauro (Daniele Liotti) and his mission to the Holy Land to locate the missing body of Jesus of Nazareth.

After arriving at his destination the search for the truth begins as Tito questions all the appropriate people about the events of the crucifixcion and the three days that followed: Pontius Pilate and his wife, Saul of Tarsus, Longinous (the Roman soldier who stuck his spear into Jesus as he hung on the cross), the apostle Peter and of course Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

During his stay in the Holy Land the young Roman also finds something unexpected, he falls in love with a beautiful young Jewish girl and follower of Christ named Tabitha (Monica Cruz).Her love helps to awaken the staunch pagan to a new belief and a new beginning.

Critique: `The Final Inquiry' attempts to fit into the Biblical epic mold made so popular in the 50's, coming away with mixed results. The acting is noticeably stiff here and there and at moments comes across as one of those documentaries with live-action re-enactments rather than a feature film.

Along the same line of reasoning, the soundtrack falls well short of capturing the romanticism and angst of the music it attempts to emulate. While it does succeed in enhancing the on-screen events it isn't particularly memorable on its own.

F. Murray Abraham has a small part and is excellent as always and the legendary Max von Sydow makes several appearances on-screen in the role of Emperor Tiberius. The rest of the cast of lesser knowns do an adequate job of interpreting the first century A.D. events surrounding the death and resurrection of the Messiah so it should find a appreciative following within the Christian community.

Personal Observation: The role of Mary, Mother of Jesus was played by Maria Pia Calzone. Though she never spoke there was something mesmerizing about her gaze and countenance. I would have liked to see more time spent on developing her character and persona. The same applies to Vincenzo Bocciarelli in the role of the young Caligula.

This story could have been much more poignant.  They went out of their way costume-wise to make it authentic-looking as possible, but somewhat flat dialogue.  The Last Legion is just a slight bit better than this movie.

3261437,5,B000YDMPBU,One of my favorite movies I will never sell and watch over and over again from year to year.  It was so moving.,1208649600,,111,3.8260869565217392
3261455,3,B000YDMPBU,"This movie has a different take on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The emperor Tiberius Caesar dispatches a tribune, Titus Valierius Tauros (Daniele Liotti) to investigate the possibility of Jesus' resurrection. During his investigation, he crosses paths with the major characters in the Gospels and Acts and concludes the resurrection did in fact happen. Several well known (at least to me) actors appear in the movie: Max Von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham, and Dolph Lundgren.

I would have enjoyed a bit more CSI flavor in Tauros' investigation, turning it more into an entertaining way to present information like Frank Morrison's Who Moved the Stone? Perhaps an intellectual companion along the lines of William of Baskerville in The Name of the Rose or Edith Pargeter's Brother Cadfael would drive the investigation forward not only through a 1st century version of a forensic investigation but also through the interaction between a Roman man of action and a 1st century man of thought similar to the interaction between Jack Aubrey and Dr. Maturin in Master and Commander.

The ending left me a bit cold. Tiberius, upon receiving Tauros' report, resolves to prevail on the Senate to move to stop persecution of the Christians. However, his son, Caligula, realizing that could undermine the ideology of the emperor's divinity, assassinates Tiberius and has Tauros' report burned.

A more interesting ending could have shown Tiberius contemplating the implications of Tauros' report, deciding it wasn't in the best interests of the empire, and then being killed by his son. That would have produced a more ironic comment on the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of man.

However, do watch the movie. It's clean entertainment and represents another step forward in creating Christian-themed entertainment with good production values.",1208217600,3,1855,5.299319727891157
3261456,1,B000YDMPBU,"My husband and I rented this to see if we wanted to purchase it for our library.  It was the most painful waste of time.  The front cover of the video and the synopsis at the back were far better than the actual movie.  I don't mind historical fiction, but this was a case of bad acting, bad directing, choppy story lines, and a terrible script.  If I'd wanted melodrama (Caligula, anyone?), a take on ""Sleeping Beauty"", and the chance to see a beautiful set with some attractive actors, this movie would have been it.  But I was looking for a serious drama that would draw me in and intrigue me.  Sadly, this movie was not it.  I'm so glad we did not buy this movie.

3261457,3,B000YDMPBU,"It had an interesting storyline, and it was never really boring. But you could tell that it lacked polish in many areas; for example, the ""earthquake"" in the opening sequence where the trees stood still and all it really looked like was someone was shaking the camera while people pretended to stagger around. Some of the dialog was strange too and seemed unpolished. However, it was still enjoyable and had a solid storyline.",1207353600,,426,4.8493150684931505
3261458,4,B000YDMPBU,"I saw this on TBN a few nights ago, and found it exceeded my expectations.  As a lawyer, I was drawn to it partially because of how it presented the truth or falsity of Jesus' Resurrection from the dead more or less as a type of ""grand jury"" inquiry, which, I believe, was exactly why the movie was named as it was.  No grand miracles were provided, except for one healing toward the end of the picture, which serves to heal the protagonist's love interest, and, in so doing, show that the skeptic's usual denials that Jesus rose from death to life again are false.  God can and does provide true life after death.
  As for the ""inquiry"" which follows, regarding the resurrection:  first, the movie showed a scene where supposed disciples ""stole"" His body and tried to carry it away to re-bury it, thereby leading to the story that He didn't rise again, and everything that led from it thereafter was a lie.  But, Titus finds that the supposed Christ body was not His; instead, the wounds supposedly made upon crucifixion were done after death.  Also,the supposed 'disciples' he slew in finding the body were hired gladiators, obviously in the employ of Pilate.  Next, they show, by ""re-enacting"" the raising of Lazarus via an unexpecting Titus, who was the one drugged, how a person can be drugged to simulate death and then awaken after several days. It is argued that both the raising of Lazarus and Christ's resurrection would then be no more than magical ""tricks"" to fool the populace into belief in Jesus.  Titus believes that, until he finds out that a miracle CAN happen, but that takes place later.  Third, they show that the Romans who were present at Jesus' death could and were pressured into falsely saying that He didn't die on Good Friday, so as to lead to the drugged-state-of-false-death version.  But, Longinus, who was the Centurion in charge at the crucifixion, while being pressured by Pilate, maintains to Titus that he, himself, knew Jesus was dead before he threw his lance into Jesus' side.  Each possibility is then shown to be false.  So, no one could have drugged Jesus, and any disappearance of His body would then have to be either by stealing it or by His Resurrection. Finally, after first believing in the ""drugging theory"", Titus finds that miracles can and do happen when God, in the person of Peter the Apostle, intervenes and restores Titus' love interest to life after she, who had suffered an apparent head injury and died.  Titus then concludes that the ancient Roman gods and goddesses are creations of man, and the God of Jesus is real, and that peace and love are the best ways to live.  He recommends that Tiberius place his faith in Jesus' Resurrection, and leaves his post as a Roman officer to live with his lady-love.  Although Caligula, who kills Tiberius, sends orders for Titus' assassination, boy gets girl, and both live happily(we hope) ever after.
  So much for the plot line.  But there are other good things to mention.  Another good feature of this movie was a view of Jesus' antagonists i.e., the persons who didn't want to let Jesus' Resurrection to become known and how they would have been acting after His supposed Resurrection.  The Sanhedrin, i.e., the Jewish hierarchy,  among whom was a person then known as ""Saul of Tarsus""(later to become a great Christian apostle known as Paul), was at that time acting to suppress the early Christians, intervened when they learned that Rome had sent a fact-finder to Jerusalem and tried their best, with Pilate's cooperation, to make Titus see that the whole story about the Resurrection had been made up by the disciples.  They were very active in trying to stamp out the Christian cult before it grew, and so when a disciple(Saint Stephen, ""the first martyr"") was caught, he was stoned to death.  Meanwhile, Pilate, the Roman Procurator, didn't want Rome to meddle in his affairs, and also tried to either kill Titus or convince him that the whole story of Jesus' rising was false, invented by the disciples.
  I found the acting credible. I wasn't looking for an Academy Award type performance in this picture, as the purpose was obvious at the outset, i.e., to provide uplifting faith-based fare for Christians and to provide a first hand look at how any real official inquiry may have been conducted, with all the Biblical characters present, had any inquiry been ordered.  The outcome, i.e., that Tiberius would order the Empire to become Christian, was, in my mind,unbelievable.  The historical Tiberius wasn't the man protrayed in the movie, looking for life after death.  Also, it seems too improbably that Tiberius would ever simply rely upon the report of one man, who had become romantically and personally involved, and then change the entire Classical god and goddess system that the Empire had been using and re-distribute the property of all the Empire, and destroy the slave-and-master system of owning persons to do the manual labor of the Empire, then in existence.  So, Caligula, in life a cruel and insane man, fills the role in this movie of restoring us to the history we know, by killing Tiberius(borrowing, possibly, from the killing of Marcus Aurelius by his son, Commodus, in Gladiator?).  The romance was done well, although I thought there was not enough time to develop the romance well enough especially since the two lovers were so different, and her contract marriage was not dealt with in a believable way.  Nevertheless, the two actors were good looking, and did their lines and scenes believably, and we know that Cupid's arrow can shoot at anyone, ergo, why not a Roman Tribune and a Hebrew upper-class Teenager?
  So, for believers, it was a good two hour view; for nonbelievers, it was probably a waste of time, but it wasn't aimed toward nonbelievers anyway.  I'd watch it again, and my wife also likes it.",1206230400,13,5852,4.811188811188811

3261461,2,B000YDMPBU,"I saw a film a couple of years ago with the same premise.  Not being made by Christians it was less than fulfilling spiritually. While this film was made from a genuine Christian slant, the production elements were less than satisfactory.
This is like a second-rate THE ROBE.  In fact there are many similarities from a Roman Tribune looking for truth to his trusty sidekick and Peter healing a woman.  Of course that film had Richard Burton...this one doesn't.  I couldn't believe F. Murray Abraham's performance.  This guy won an Oscar?!!?  And Dolph Lundgren...who knows?  His dialogue was so stilted, I started longing for the atrocious dialogue of the lastest STAR WARS movies, but that isn't really his fault. And I had to put my foot down with the Caligula homage to GLADIATOR.  First of all we never hear about Caligula until the very end and he comes in looking like an actor from a Silent Film...blaring eyes and overdone body movements...reminded me of Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BLVD.
I will say this. The costumes were spectacular.  And I really liked the flashbacks with Jesus.  And I also liked the guy playing Peter. I've never seen him played just that way and I really liked it.  I also liked the tying together of Saul and Stephen.  Very nice idea.
This was a good idea for a film but like most Christian films, it falls short of the mark.  It's a shame because I personally think films about God deserve the VERY BEST.  Maybe someday Hollywood will catch on.  Hey Hollywood, there's plenty of Christians that will see these movies if you make them right or didn't you hear about the millions PASSION OF THE CHRIST made.  I know you're all about money and frankly we're willing to part with it...we just want some quality with our spirituality. Not too much to ask, is it?",1205366400,11,1789,4.649681528662421
3261462,3,B000YDMPBU,"'The Final Inquiry"" is an Italian film that was made in English, but got dubbed over again [to cover the accents I presume] and is set during the Roman Empire, circa 33 AD. A series of earthquakes on a particular day that is felt around the world sets the Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar [Max Von Sydow] to command one of his tribunes Titus Valerius Taurus [Daniel Loggia] to go to Jerusalem, where the Emperor believes the crucifixion of a certain Jesus from the province of Judea and the resurrection rumors surrounding him is reponsible for the events.

Tribune Titus goes off to Jerusalem with a slave captured in fighting, a germanic warrior Brixas [Dolph Lundgren] and they encounter a group of people called the Nazarenes, who carry on the teachings of Jesus, in spite of persecution. They also meet Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who finds Titus' inquiry into the whereabouts of Jesus' body a threat to his authority.

Besides the search for answers as to how Jesus died, and what happened to his body afterwards, and the greater question of whether he was truly resurrected [Pilate and the Pharisees go to great lengths to try and disprove the resurrection theory], the other main plot centers around the romance that develops between Titus and a Nazarene, Tabitha and their love story holds the film together. Their chemistry is palbable [yes, its a Biblical story, yet the interplay of dialogue and emotion between these two is credibly done]. Titus finds himself drawn, despite his skepticism, to the noble manner in which the Nazarenes carry themselves, and a tragedy followed by a miracle causes him to question his own lack of faith.

Though this is not ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", it is a decently-made Biblical movie. The sets are quite convincing [I think the movie itself was shot in Tunisia] and the acting, though far from great, is credible. Dolph Lundgren as the slave warrior is quite convincing in his role, and the actors portraying Titus and Tabitha are credible too, as is the actor playing Pontius Pilate [who also portrayed pilate in The Passion of Christ]. For a hammy performance, look out for the actor portraying Caligula.

Final verdict - a pleasantly watchable Biblical movie, but if your expectations are high, you may want to skip this one.",1205020800,17,2284,4.878865979381444
