8219616,4,B000VS6LZE,"This was better than I expected it to be.  I thought it was going to be just another flick with a bunch of young, good looking, cute and sexy gay young men prancing around but it had an interesting but silly story line.  The two main characters  A Hong and A Shin are friends from childhood.  A Hong is ""straight"" and A Shin is gay.  A Hong's girl friend is a shopaholic but only buys for herself and only with A Hong's credit. and the bill collectors are on his tail to the tune of 10,000,00.  It just so happens that there is a go-go boy contest with that amount as the top prize.  The one stipulation is that the contestant has to be gay.  A Shin enters along with A Hong to sort of protect him (he is secretly in love with A Hong)  In addition there is an anti-gay bomb threat against the contest and Jae an undercover cop who is straight also enters the contest pretending to be gay to discover who the bomber is.  It is funny and the ending is heartwarming as Hong realizes the truth about his relationship with A Shin.",1384560000,,1025,4.157360406091371

Would have liked to see a little bit more man on man action but the swim suit scenes made up for that.  Very fun, would recommend adding it to your collection.",1340150400,,317,3.953125

8219619,5,B000VS6LZE,"Go! Go! G-Boys was a fantastic movie, and as far as I can tell, the only one of it's kind.
I absolutely love gay movies, mostly because of all the gay issues going aroung being brought up, and partly because nothing makes me happier than to see two guys or two women happy on the bigscreen. However, most homosexual movies often have unhappy endings. For instance, the ever-classic Brokeback Mountain, or the older but still fantastic Bishonen, which are glorious movies, but are still tear jerkers to the end.
It's probably trying to show the difficulty of homosexual relationships in a narrowminded world etc etc etc, but we all need a bit of happy now and then right? Even the gays deserve happy endings!
Go! Go! G-boys delivers just that, filled with delightful comedy from begining to end. And don't worry, just because it's a romantic comedy, it doesn't make it totally pointless. Valid points are still made throughout the movie, with fagbashing and confused feelings, the difficulty of coming out, misunderstandings, angst, only instead of it being thrown at you with a sense of impending doom like most movies, they are given to you with a side of hope and happiness.
All together I found the movie delightful, my mum and I were rolling in our seats.",1215216000,4,1259,4.779816513761468
