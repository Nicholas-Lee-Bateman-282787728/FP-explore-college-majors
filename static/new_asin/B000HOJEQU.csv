8140588,5,B000HOJEQU,"All segments on this DVD are 15 minutes except for the warm-up, which is 8 minutes.  The segments are:

warm-up: 8mins
aeroburn (pure cardio): 15mins
BPM (dance): 15mins
Beatbox (cardio + toning)
Below Belt (toning - lunges, the plank, sit-ups, tricep and normal press-ups etc): 15mins

I've been doing the first segment called ""aeroburn"" which is a high-energy cardio workout for a few days.  I think it's very effective at getting you out of breath and tired pretty quickly.  I've been finding it intense, but because it's only 15 minutes, it's over before you know it, so I don't mind giving it all I've got because I know it doesn't go on for too long!  I'm a moderate exerciser.  As I get fitter, I plan to do one of the other segments after aeroburn, so this DVD offers the opportunity to keep challenging you as you get fitter.  With a total of 4 segments, I think this DVD offers good value for money and plenty of variety.

I tried the ""Below the belt"" segment just once.  It was a bit easier than I expected - there are quite a lot of rest breaks, and for me, I would prefer to just focus on what's below the belt, i.e. legs, butt, abs - it's not a priority for me to work on my chest, back and arms right now because I don't carry my flab there.  That said, I think the ab bits must be quite effective cos I could definitely feel I'd worked my abs the day after!

I give this DVD 5 stars for the aeroburn segment alone!  It's intense, yet quick, so an efficient way to exercise:-)  And I still have two other segments to look forward to trying out!

The instructor is also very attractive and beautifully toned, which I find inspiring!",1341792000,4,1646,4.350819672131148
8140589,5,B000HOJEQU,"I feel compelled to write this review because I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.

I have owed this for around three years now and it is the only one I come back to if I want to do a proper workout.  I have lots of exercise DVDs and also have the Just Dance set and Zumba on the Wii but this beats them by far.

It is hard work, there are good dance routines which once you remember them they are fun to do (I have no rhythm at all but still manage to bust some moves) and you hurt like mad the next day which, as far as I am concerned, is the only way to know whether you have done enough.

You can make up your own routine however short or long you want which tops it off as the perfect exercise regime.

My favourite is the boxing section though because that is the only way to get rid of the flabby bits at the back!!!",1334620800,5,829,3.8816568047337277
8140590,5,B000HOJEQU,"I have to say that it wasn't my favorite, but I still give it five. It's very good, but the moves weren't as challenging, as the other vids were. Still, very good if you simply want to break a sweat, and not work too hard. I thought the moves were a little too 90s ish, and not in a good way. Still, I'm a fan so I can't totally put it down. I still do the video about once a week, or whenever I just need to work out.",1328054400,,418,3.707865168539326
8140591,5,B000HOJEQU,"Great dvd-- fun music, high energy through the whole aerobic section.  Exactly what I was looking for to get fit after childbirth.  I like this series so much I have all of the dvds now.  Deanne Berry & Fiona are the best instructors, though.",1225929600,3,242,4.454545454545454
