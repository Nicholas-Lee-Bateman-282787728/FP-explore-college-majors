8678358,5,B00KXC7B84,What an interesting peek into one of the smaller Civil War battles.  We learn snippets of stories about the big battles but never even hear about the many small battles that took place in our own backyards.  If you love rural or military history this film is well worth watching.,1402617600,,279,4.56
