However, after getting into the noise / drone scene just a few years ago (in my teenage years), I stumbled across this gem and decided from the start to watch it all the way through, regardless of how bad it was. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, although I hadn't previously heard of any (or most!) of these Portland artists in my entire life, they had a lot of interesting perspectives & meaning behind the world of chaos they create in the name of music. Some of the artists like Sisprum Vish and Soup Purse really stood out to me music-wise for their originality, while supergroup Smegma and drone duo GOD had a surprising amount of intellectual things to contribute to the noise genre as a whole - not to mention Pulse Emitter's lecture on the doomsday of planet earth.

All in all, I rate this a 5. Although it's a bit dark and ominous at times, it really does showcase a wide range of noise & drone artists at their best, and hopefully opens up the eyes of those who refuse to turn off the radio!",1313625600,,1125,4.331753554502369

I have just recently discovered the wonderful world of noise documentaries; I was unaware such things existed until a few months ago, thinking that we in the noise community were entirely unrepresented in the documentary world. How wrong I was, and how happy I am about that.

People Who Do Noise focuses on noise and experimental artists from the Portland, OR area, one of the more vibrant noise scenes in America right now (though I'm depressed at the exclusion of Sleeping with the Earth, one of America's finest noise acts). It's about what you'd expect from a noise documentary; thoughtful interviews, performance footage, the odd shot of people wondering what on earth wondering what that horrid sound emanating from that abandoned-looking building is. An obvious must-have for fans of any of the bands depicted here (Oscillating Innards, Smegma, Kitty Midwife, With Caro, a short Daniel Menche bit, a bunch of others), but the noise-doco field is not yet so saturated that you can't pick one up at random and get a good impression of the scene; Nor Noise is, in my estimation, a hair better than this, but both are well worth having. ****",1246060800,3,1189,4.91044776119403
