4004250,5,B002W1UIV6,"I watched this video last night, it was very funny. In fact if you are Iranian it will be twice as funny as if you are not, and if you are not Iranian but you have some Iranian friends, still it will be very funny. This guy, Maz Jobrani is is not only talented but also, very energetic and animated. The only thing that you should know is that the other two guys on the cover do not have any scenes in the DVD.",1273449600,11,410,3.892857142857143

4004253,5,B002W1UIV6,"Every time I see Maz in a show Live or on clip, I still laugh the same way I laughed the very first time I saw him.  The Man has the mental and physical ability to be the piece he's talking about.  I don't know how to quite explain it, ... it's in his quality of presence on stage, every twitch on his face, or sound that comes out of his mouth, I don't know things happen so fast it's hard to pinpoint... Just see him for yourself and write your own review here, Ok?",1265241600,8,467,3.905263157894737
4004254,5,B002W1UIV6,"Maz is the Elvis of comedy and the Lady GaGa of standup!

8382729,4,B002W1UIV6,"How he spins a difficult era to evoke laughter is clever and masterful. Neither pro Iranian, nor pro American, he exposes follies on both sides.  First saw him perform on the Craig Furgerson show a few weeks ago,he was hilarious. From 2009,when this show was produced, to his new 2011 material,I think he's grown in his craft, and has a promising future. I recommend this dvd to everyone, especially those who are getting weary of the doom and gloom surrounding us and might enjoy a brief respite.",1307750400,,497,4.712643678160919
8382730,5,B002W1UIV6,Maz Jobrani is hysterical and this video does not disappoint. He does a great job of walking the fine line between what is mildly politically incorrect and what shouldn't be said. And he makes you double over with laughter while he does it.,1294876800,,240,4.604651162790698
8382731,2,B002W1UIV6,"I like Maz Jobrani a lot and find him to be an intelligent and funny comedian/actor. But I have to say this DVD was a major disappointment. Not only does it contain material that is redundant, but some of his jokes are just plain crude and stupid. Take a look at his stand-up acts on You Tube, skip this DVD.",1278115200,2,308,4.15
