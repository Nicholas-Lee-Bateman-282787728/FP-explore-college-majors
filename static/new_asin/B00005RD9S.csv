1654450,2,B00005RD9S,"I must say, I didn't have a clue who Alvin Lee was or 10 Years After.  Now I know!  What a great guitarist!!!  I certainly felt like ripping his clothes off as he ripped that guitar up, so I understand how those groupies felt.  Unfortunately, most of them come across as boring, un-attractive, brainless air-heads!  If you are looking for ""Penny Lane"", you won't find her here!  I enjoyed the segments with Cynthia Plaster-Caster and Pamela Des Barres, the most famous groupies and no need to identify them, I know them by sight!  I didn't have a clue who the other girls were.  It would have been nice if their names were pictured somewhere during their interviews, so I could put a name to a face!  More could have been done to spruce up the dvd!  It will become obvious how a pretty girl (though no raving beauty) like Pamela Des Barres became ""the most famous"" groupie....most groupies (judging by this dvd) were hideously ugly!  Other famous (and BEAUTIFUL) groupies, like Catherine James and Christine Boris, are not on this, just so the buyer knows...",1037664000,4,1058,4.664864864864865
1654451,5,B00005RD9S,"Besides giving us a look into a 60's phenomana, the groupies, we get to hear some of the most blistering songs ever played by Ten Years After back intheir prime. The band is still great today, but the playing due in part I believe to ingested chemicals, is what made this group the best of all time.  Alvin's fantastic guitar work, Leo's sympathetic bass lines, Chick's moody but not down keyboard work, and last but not least Ric Lee's penominal drumming show whay this was the band no-one wanted to follow on stage. Listen and savour. Dan Jasper",1006646400,2,547,4.581632653061225
7952005,2,B00005RD9S,"I've seen some entertaining documentaries about groupies, but this isn't one of them. At best, this is an amateurish mish-mash of low-grade groupies (with the exception of Pamela Des Barres) intermingled with concert footage of Ten Years After, Terry Reid, Spooky Tooth, and Joe Cocker. The odd bit is that I can't recall any mention of Joe Cocker, by groupies or otherwise, to warrant his appearance in this film. My best guess is that Cocker happened to be on location at the time of filming, providing this lackadaisical filmmaker with his only eurekan moment: This A-lister will beef up my project!!

What exactly does the viewer have to gain from watching Groupies?
Tips, advice, and helpful information such as:
1) How NOT to film a documentary.
2) How to make an exhibition of yourself when a videocamera is present.
3) How to be topless in public and still feel comfortable.
4) How to make people listen to any given amount of hot air.
5) Novelty hairstyles-in-extremis will help you get noticed.
6) Join the Plaster Casters and you may win an opportunity to meet a real star and prepare his schmeckel for casting.
7) Spooky Tooth is not a character from Scooby Doo or H. R. Pufnstuf.
8) Men can also be members of the less-common, but no less respectable society of male groupies.

Groupies often appears to be a disjointed presentation of a hippie commune. It fails to deliver the ""dirt"" and fails to provide anything interesting either comical* or noteworthy. For those who enjoy a certain disorganized unedited quality and have no problem if it's inaudible or out-of-focus, don't waste another minute. If you want to see a coherent, entertaining documentary about groupies, check out Let's Spend the Night Together: Confessions of Rock's Greatest Groupies, or, Do It For the Band: The Women of the Sunset Strip.

7952006,4,B00005RD9S,"This documentary is really cool as it brings out one aspect of the rock and roll of the era. It is a parallel aspect to a scene that I knew very little about at the time, which is probably a good thing. There are several Groupies like Pamela Martin, Connie H, Cindy P. and others that you can find out how they are doing today, I would love to see what the rest are doing now or even if they survived. I feel like a fly on the wall.",1445385600,,432,3.865168539325843

7952009,3,B00005RD9S,"It's a view of rock & roll history, but the quality of this is horrible. It's almost  unwatchable. Not worth the money.  Terry Reid is the one redeeming moment, covering Sonny & Cher's song ""Bang Bang"". That is stellar!",1371686400,,219,4.589743589743589

7952011,3,B00005RD9S,"This movie is for the hard-core groupie fan! The movie is priceless for someone who is obsessed with groupies and what they did. This movie is not for anyone who simply is interested in groupie culture. That said, I am obsessed with groupie culture. The DVD edition is lacking in some areas: There are no subtitle options or close captioning, and sometimes it is hard to understand what girls or band members are saying. The audio could be better.

The documentary is a little treasure that should be appreciated by groupie fans. The documentary, although it seems a little manipulated, captures the true love and passion that groupies felt for the music and the musicians that inspired them. The film contains segments by Queens of the Scene such as Cynthia Plaster Caster, her apprentices and Pamela des Barres. The beautiful Cynthia explains a little about her art. Pam talks about the Plaster Casters and why she loves English men. A male groupie also makes an appearance trying to convince Terry Reid to fall in love with him... The film also captures the crazy buzz and vibe of the 70s.",1332633600,4,1092,4.777777777777778
7952012,1,B00005RD9S,"I am in this movie, so I think I am qualified to say that much of the non musical content contained was in fact manipulated by the brothers Maysels, who really reached for the bottom of the barrel shock value in their superficial and unkind telling of what life was like for the women who dated the rock stars.

To set up a ""Party"" in an art gallery of erotic art..where none of us had ever been before and were totally surprised by..well there you go. The Maysles were looking for seamy, and they got it, even if the punch had to be spiked.",1257033600,5,541,4.201923076923077
7952013,3,B00005RD9S,"The first time I saw this film was in 1971, and the second time I saw it was last Friday night.  I think I appreciated it more this time; in 1971 I was a lot younger, and didn't have the advantage of 35+ years more of experience.  The ""60s"" were still going on, and none of us were thinking about ever looking back at any of this.

Most of us, of course, never got any closer to the real world of the rock subculture than to perhaps get lucky and get to be close to the stage at a concert. We listened to the records and smoked lots of dope, but, when you get right down to it, we were wannabes who didn't have whatever it takes to really live that life.

This film is about wannabes who wanted harder than most of us: those (mostly) girls who thought that if they got close enough to their idols, some of that glory and charisma would somehow rub off on them.  Perhaps some of it did rub off, in a weird sort of way.

It seems to me that this movie breaks down into basically three parts: first, there's some stuff about these girls in New York (I think it was New York, anyway), Spooky Tooth and Luther Grosvenor.  Then there's some time spent with gay groupies in San Francisco, involving Terry Reid and his band, and finally, after that, we get some discussion of plaster casting and then get to listen to a plaster casting, with the camera averted.  I have to say that I was unwholesomely chortling all the way through this film, which was made for exploitation purposes; I'm certain that the people who made this never even remotely considered it as a document for posterity.

The value of the movie, in my opinion, comes from the film's historical quality.  If you want to see the best of the best, the ideal at its peak, and the finest moment of the counterculture, watch the Woodstock documentary.  But as good as that movie is, it doesn't show the whole picture.  I think this film _Groupies_ gives the viewer a better picture of the whole scene at that time: a picture of second- or third-tier musicians playing at second-rate venues, of groupies chasing these guys because the real stars, such as Led Zeppelin, are too hard to get close to, and, of course,these people being filmed by third-rate filmmakers looking to make a quick buck from shock value.  There's a pervasive atmosphere of the pathetic about this film...  A lot more time, in that time, was spent like this, than was spent in major peak moments such as the Woodstock rock festival.

There are a couple of decent musical moments in the film: a clip of Joe Cocker (who otherwise is not in the movie -- he must have been one of those who were ""real hard to get to""), as well as Alvin Lee of Ten Years After giving his best testosterone-fueled performance of ""I Wanna Ball You All Night Long.""  The rest of the music, in my opinion, is fairly forgettable.

I give this movie three stars, because of its historical value as a primary document.  If this review was only about the actual quality of the film, it would have to be one star, or maybe a touch better than that, because it really isn't a very good show.  But it gives the viewer a glimpse of how things were in those days, and that redeems much.",1214870400,10,3178,4.3559322033898304
7952014,3,B00005RD9S,"This cinema verite documentary from 1970 attempts to capture the zietgiest of late-60's rock'n'roll groupiedom, with mixed results. Filmed during the transition when idealistic Peace Love and Dope hippiedom was morphing into the more seedy and decadent excesses that would define the 70's music scene, you may feel like taking a shower after a viewing. Not as involving or professionaly crafted as the Maysles brothers or D.A. Pennebaker offerings from the era (""Gimme Shelter"", ""Monterey Pop""), the film suffers from sloppy editing and inferior audio mastering (it is difficult to understand what the stoned-out-of-thier-mind groupies are prattling on about most of the time, not that the majority of them have anything very enlightening to say!). It's too bad the filmmakers didn't spend more time with the two most ""famous"" groupies of the era, Pamela Des Barres (aka ""Miss Pamela"") and Cynthia ""Plaster Caster"" (At least they display some personality and the ability to communicate an amusing anecdote or two) Most of the film time is devoted to an assortment of needy, parasitic wannabes listlessly killing time backstage, clamoring to be acknowleged. The film holds more interest as a musical document, with largely intact performances from the little seen (and underappreciated) Terry Reid, as well as Ten Years After and Joe Cocker And The Grease Band. The great Spooky Tooth is seen in snippets-featuring a very young and somewhat dopey Luther Grosvenor, who I am sure winces now when he watches it (especially during a less-than-flattering discussion of his, er, ""shortcomings"" by a couple of giggling groupies comparing notes). The 2006 DVD release has no extras or commentary, and it appears no effort was made to restore picture or sound. Worthwhile to hardcore 70's rock fans for historical value, if nothing else.",1159747200,18,1828,5.285223367697594
