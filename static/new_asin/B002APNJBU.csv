3890648,5,B002APNJBU,"My 6 year old daughter started watching the T.V. show and wanted to got to the library to read the books.  After reading them for about 15 times; I purchased Olivia helps with Christmas, Olivia saves the Circus, Olivia forms a Band, Dream Big starring Olivia, Olivia Opposites and finally Olivia Counts (phew!) that's a mouth full.  I would definitely recommend these books and more especially if your child loves to read oh and loves Olivia(May I remind you that she is a pig).",1256688000,3,478,4.678571428571429
3890649,4,B002APNJBU,Olivia (DVD) has a series of short stories instead of a movie format. This video was purchased for a 2 1/2 year old girl. It was age appropriate and she enjoyed it.,1252713600,7,164,4.15625
3890650,5,B002APNJBU,"This series is so cute! The whole neighborhood came over (practically) when word got out that I got the DVD for my sons. We love Olivia's expressions and ear movements, and she's a great cartoon role model. This is a very clever, funny selection of episodes, highly recommend.",1252108800,15,276,4.770833333333333
3890651,5,B002APNJBU,"My toddler and I actually saw this TV show on Nickelodeon before we even knew about the books. We fell in love with the show, so I bought the book and it is my daughter's absolute FAVORITE. One of her first words is actually ""Olivia"". So of course, we give this DVD 5 stars. I've been hoping and waiting for months for them to release a DVD of it and I was so excited when they did! I just wish it had a few more episodes, of course ;) but it is a nice length for the price.

Here are the episodes included:
Olivia Acts Out
Olivia and Grandma's Visit

Olivia Plays Piano
Olivia Trains Her Cat

Olivia and The Crystal Ball
Olivia Plays Soccer

Olivia Packs Up
Olivia Is Invited To Dinner

Hopefully they will release more episodes on DVD soon! We can't get enough of Olivia :)",1250380800,85,775,4.174496644295302

3890655,3,B002APNJBU,"Using my Gramp`s account. My cousin I think rented one of the Olivia DVDs from his local library. I never found a lot of interest in the series itself. The episodes are kinda boring and has really advanced computer animation. The characters are all pigs and Olivia is always giving rules of life I can`t really understand. Don`t force yourself to buy it, because it is really for a 5-7 year old audience. If you are looking for a DVD for younger ages, I recommend Peppa Pig.",1417046400,,474,4.459770114942529

3890659,5,B002APNJBU,"Olivia has been watched very often. The coloring is great and hold the child's interest, It has very good content to the story",1388534400,,126,4.521739130434782
3890660,5,B002APNJBU,My 4 year old daughter is a fan of Olivia and she enjoyed receiving this as a birthday present from us this year.  I Recommend it!!!,1384992000,,132,4.076923076923077
3890661,5,B002APNJBU,"My son loves the Olivia books so I got this dvd. It's very cute and he loves the characters. It has auto play which I love for when I'm busy, it starts on its own.",1381795200,,163,3.6857142857142855
3890662,5,B002APNJBU,Contains eight classic Olivia episodes. Olivia is a young pig with a big imagination. These fun episodes show Olivia and her friends on some of their many adventures. No rough talk or actions involved in this show. Perfectly appropriate for viewers of all ages.,1380585600,,261,4.954545454545454
3890663,5,B002APNJBU,These are the same cartoons that you watch on Nick Jr. They are in bright and the menu is user friendly on the DVD. No complaints with the DVD whatsoever.,1378339200,,154,4.166666666666667
3890664,5,B002APNJBU,"This is a nice compilation of Olivia episodes.  It allowed me to free up some space on my DVR (LOL), plus I can send this DVD to the sitters or grandparents house!  My son is a big fan of Olivia and I highly recommend this product, and for $5.99, you can't go wrong.",1378080000,,266,4.0
3890665,4,B002APNJBU,"My little daycare girls imitate her. It's a stick-with-it kind of movie,too. My older daycare kids get bored with it, other than the first time",1376438400,,143,4.76
3890666,5,B002APNJBU,My daughter loves Olivia. She's one of her first favorite cartoons. It's great to have this DVD with a few episodes to keep her happy when there is nothing else she wants to watch.,1375142400,,180,4.323529411764706
3890667,5,B002APNJBU,"My 18 month old adores this DVD. I have to admit, I purchased it because the main character has a black cat and my daughter loves cats, but we have fallen for Olivia. She is brave, kind and imaginative. She wants to be an astronaut, or a concert pianist, or perhaps a cat trainer when she grows up. The episode about ""sharing"" is funny, when the adults have to share their things, their house and car, the way they ask children to share their toys. The only criticism I have is there are only 8 episodes. Note about the opening commercials; they played the first time we watched it, but the disc skips straight to the main menu all subsequent times.",1368489600,,649,4.371900826446281
3890668,5,B002APNJBU,"I bought this for my girls---they can watch it over and over.  It is just long enough, yet if you need to stop it, you have breaks in between episodes.",1366588800,,151,4.033333333333333
3890669,4,B002APNJBU,Has all my daughters favorite episodes.  The color seems a bit off however.  It just seems lighter than when we watch the episodes on Nick Jr.,1365984000,,142,4.423076923076923
3890670,5,B002APNJBU,Another Olivia DVD that the grand kids love to watch.  There are five grand kids and they want to watch Olivia.,1358812800,,111,4.285714285714286
3890671,4,B002APNJBU,My daughter loves to watch Olivia and this dvd was a great addition to her collection. DVD was in great condition and was delivered super fast.,1351209600,,143,4.538461538461538
3890672,4,B002APNJBU,"My daughter can watch this dvd over and over and over again.  I must say, I enjoy the episodes also.  I only wish the dvd was longer.  It came super quick though.  Totally satisfied!",1350432000,,182,4.264705882352941
3890673,4,B002APNJBU,Bought this video for my granddaughter.  She loves the show. Has a good amount of shows on it.  The only problem is all the advertising for other movies at the beginning before you get to the shows.  Do they not realize that kids get impatient?  Most of the advertising will not let you skip forward.  My Granddaughter loves the video and will use alot when we travel. Lower review because of all the advertising.,1338076800,,413,4.527027027027027
3890674,1,B002APNJBU,"We bought this to keep our toddler occupied on a long plane trip, and we love the TV show.  However, I am disappointed at the amount of commercials at the beginning of the disk.  Toddlers are not known for their patience, and a fussy toddler waiting for her show defeats the entire purpose of having this as a distraction.",1330214400,6,322,4.440677966101695
3890675,5,B002APNJBU,"I lost count of how many time I have seen this movie, my daughter could watch it all day. Best purchase ever!!!",1323388800,,111,4.090909090909091
3890676,4,B002APNJBU,"Our Olivia video came very fast, it was in great condition!  Our VERY selective movie library grew by one little pig!  thanks",1319673600,,125,4.636363636363637
3890677,5,B002APNJBU,"Great video, my Daughter loves it. Keeps her entertained. She loves her Vee-Vee-Vee(Olivia). Over an hour of Olivia. Received as advertised. Thank you.",1316390400,,151,5.608695652173913
3890678,5,B002APNJBU,There are not too many Nick Jr. Olivia dvd's out right now.  My daughter loves this dvd.  If you love Olivia you will not be disappointed by adding this to your collection.,1302998400,,172,4.34375
3890679,5,B002APNJBU,"I ordered this for my daughter, who loves Olivia. It was shipped to me very quickly and was a great experience overall!",1294790400,,119,4.454545454545454
3890680,5,B002APNJBU,"My 2-year-old son fell in love with Olivia on Noggin. I canceled our cable this summer and bought him DVDs of his favorite shows. He absolutely loves this DVD, especially the episode where Olivia visits Francine for dinner. The scene at the table with Ian eating his spaghetti cracks him up every time.

It's a great variety of shows, and I can't thank Nickelodeon enough for putting EIGHT episodes on the DVD. It's almost 4 hours of the show, and at a really good price. I wish they'd come out with more non-themed Olivia DVDs!",1293926400,,528,4.557894736842106
3890681,3,B002APNJBU,"We first met Olivia through the Christmas DVD.  We're super picky about what our kids watch and we loved the Christmas one so much that we went out and bought the Ballet one and this orignal one as well.  I love the ballet dvd, but I cringed enough through the first few episodes of this dvd that we never finished it and I will be finding a new home for it.  Like I said, we're super picky.  This dvd is not as crisp in the story lines as the other two, not as original and clever.  It relies a little too much on using contention, competition with friends, and sibling rivalry as humor.  Since my kids are preschoolers and like to imitate behaviors instead of learn from them, I'd rather not have them watch this particular dvd.  Having said that though, the others are wonderful and clever and I love them for the same reasons that I dislike this one.  There is minimal contention, competition, and sibling rivalry in the others.  The siblings are very sweet and positive to each other and we've all enjoyed the clever imagination and subtle humor of Olivia!",1290556800,16,1061,4.455958549222798
3890682,5,B002APNJBU,I bought this for my children who are 3 and 4 (almost 5). They watch it over and over again. They love the video. The episodes are just about the right length and there are several on the video. It is a cute video that brings the Olivia books to life.,1287619200,,251,3.9411764705882355
3890683,5,B002APNJBU,Great Service. Ordered the DVD and got it in the same week it was ordered.,1280707200,,74,4.0
3890684,5,B002APNJBU,"My 2 and a half year old loves this DVD. She has had the original Olivia book, and we've read it to her since she was very young, so perhaps that's part of the reason she's so into this movie. If she has a choice, this is the DVD she picks to watch.

There are ""commercials"" for other Nick shows at the beginning of the DVD. You can't go straight to the menu; however, if you press the Next Chapter button 5 or 6 times, it will very quickly skip right through all of them.",1274918400,10,472,3.968421052631579
3890685,3,B002APNJBU,"The videos themselves are fine, we've seen them all before on Nickolodeon, and that's what I wanted.  BUT, I must agree with the other reviewer who commented on the commercials before the episodes start.  They are absolutely ridiculous, last 10 minutes and you can't forward through them.  I won't be buying another one of these dvds because of them.",1273449600,7,350,4.898305084745763
3890686,5,B002APNJBU,"I received this as a gift for my 3 year old, and she adores it.  We have been fans of the book for about 6 months, and also of the audio books (featuring Dame Edna) and so this is a fun addition to the character that she has grown to love, with new story lines and good lessons (about sharing, teamwork, taking others' feelings into account) and it's just plain clever.  I highly recommend it as the episodes are short but have a really good beginning, middle and end - well written and with interesting animation (so expressive).

I bet Ian Falconer approved these, and he's the brainchild of it all.",1271116800,,601,4.396396396396397
3890687,5,B002APNJBU,"My 7 year old Olivia loves anything Olivia.  She's gotten the books and plush dolls since she was born.  When I saw this DVD I just knew we had to have it.  We've only had it for a few days and it's already been watched several times.  I love the stories and the animation is very creative.  Just because this is a ""pre-school"" DVD doesn't mean that kids of any age won't enjoy it!  We also found that we have a lot in common with Olivia and her family...I wish I could be friends with this Olivia's mom!!! :-)",1270339200,,510,4.101010101010101

3890690,3,B002APNJBU,I was told to get this video because it would be great for my 2y/o. She had an initial interest but has not really watched this video. I personally don't think it's that interesting.,1258156800,2,182,4.382352941176471
