8296545,2,B0015I2S4C,"I debated over whether to award this two stars or three, but in the end I went with two primarily because of the run time (basically two merciless hours).

Unlike the many other Peach titles that more or less pretend to be features but are instead no more than a bunch of themed vignettes Scotch taped together on either end by brief speaking parts, ""Alley Dogs"" is indeed a genuine feature-length film--the first (only?) by Peach. It's also genuinely bad. If you've got a brain in your head, as soon as you get five minutes into it you'll realize why Peach has stayed out of features for all of these years.

I'd go so far as to call this unwatchable but for the oh-so-brief appearance of Jaime Hammer as a stripper, and a major role by some other chick (not a Peach regular and I didn't recognize her) who has a nice bump. Also Ron Jeremy has a solid role in this--even a sex scene for the first time in years--and he has a nice turn.

Let's get around to the particulars of why this deserves two stars. Besides the duration (way too long at two hours), 1) the acting is terrible, 2) the writing is worse and 3) the sex even is so banal that it makes 1 and 2 that much more prominent. In these releases you first of all look at the quality of the women. Strike one. Not the typical Peach lineup and even though about 10 different women have nude scenes, only about two of them are really hot (most of the rest have low-quality breast implants) and the scenes themselves hit with no velocity. Very poor simulation, no on-set audio, only one scene of explicit exposure (and that of an ugly girl). In fact there is almost no full frontal nudity at all. Bad all the way around.

Here's a typical example of the acting quality: In one scene a character drops a bowling ball on his foot and then proceeds for the next 30 seconds to act as if his entire body is being pulled into a log debarker. That's pretty much par for the course in this film. Strike two.

Here's an example of the writing: One character is a gynecologist (plenty of jokes drop concerning his profession...oh, my sides!) and inexplicably, for about 30 minutes halfway through the  movie, he decides that he's gay and then the audience is subjected to every single stupid gay male stereotype in existence. Strike three.

Pretty much everything about this movie is stupid and inane. I could have overlooked that--I have before--if the women were hotter and the scenes involving them were more tantalizing. Since that isn't the case, I wouldn't recognize this junk for viewing by anybody else, and I'll likely never willingly watch it again myself.",1360368000,,2611,4.5073995771670194
