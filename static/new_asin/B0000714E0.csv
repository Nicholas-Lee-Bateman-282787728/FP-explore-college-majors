7973993,5,B0000714E0,"Another fine flick directed by the renown yet underrated Lee Tso Nam whose catalog included the Hot Cool & Vicious, Challenge of Death, Eagle's Claw, Shaolin vs. Lama & Woman Avenger just to name a few. This one revolves around the titled item that everyone is trying to get their hands on. 3 thieves acquire the statuette by wiping out a whole family that it belonged to then entrusted a brothel owner Madam Pearl (Hu Chin) whose brother happens to be one of the bandits. Chen Chang (Meng Fei) is hired to retrieve it from Madam Pearl, but she's protected by her beau Wu Kang (Chi Kuan Chun). Along the way, Chen Chang is befriended by one of the prostitutes (Meng Chui) who has motives of her own & by a rose-toting kung fu man (Wang Kuan Hsiung). But after many other killers who are after the statuette & a lot of double crosses along the way, it points to a grand finale at a nearby temple. Also in this is Tommy Lee as a nosy hunchbacked waiter at the brothel with an agenda, Jimmy Lee as Wu Kang's right hand man, Phillip Ko as the bodyguard at Madam Pearl's brothel, Lung Fei as Madam Pearl's brother, Leung Kar Yan as one of the other bandits & a cameo by Shan Mao.

The action here was pretty much non-stop. Meng Fei & Chi Kuan Chun are reunited on film after Shaw Brothers' Five Shaolin Masters & both shines with their martial arts skills. Tommy Lee is cold-hearted & badass as usual. Wang Kuan Hsiung flashes his skills briefly as does Lung Fei, Leung Kar Yan & Shan Mao. Phillip Ko underwhelms from his normal fare.

Overall, a very good plot + awesome kung fu action = a bonafide classic that's not to be missed by those intrigued by the genre!",1493942400,,1659,4.348387096774194

7973996,5,B0000714E0,This is one of the all around best kung fu films ever released.  It's all star.  The storyline is excellent.  The fighting is among some of the most realistic and contray to previous posts the acting is very good and delivered with conviction.  The english dub is among the best of the genre.

7973997,3,B0000714E0,"Chi Kuan Chun (""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"") plays Wu Kang, protector of all businesses in Stone Village and fiance of Madame Pearl (Hu Chin), who runs the local brothel.  When known assassin Chen Chang (Meng Fei, The ""Prodigal Boxer"") shows up at the brothel and leaves an ultimatum that could result in Pearl's death (should she not comply), Wu Kang must figure out what's going on...  which will require a lot more than just asking questions and kicking faces.

What a pleasant surprise this was.  A unique entry in my collection of old school flicks, with a cool, easy-to-follow story and plenty of twists.  The fights are kinda slow at first, but nonetheless enjoyable, and they occur frequently.  Plenty of big names have smaller roles including Jimmy Lee, Philip Ko, Lung Fei, and even Leung Kar Yan.

Tai Seng's Martial Arts Theater version is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because it's fullscreened.  Though the picture quality is quite good, you will often be given a view of the side of someone's head when they are the only one speaking.  Luckily this has little bearing on the action.  The only reason I did not award this 4-stars is because repeat viewings won't likely be as enjoyable as one's first time with this.  It's still a very good film and is certainly recommended.  English dubbed only.  3.5/5

7973999,4,B0000714E0,"This flick is no joke! When I first got this one off of Amazon.com, I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about the title. But let me tell you the title will straight up throw you off.  Don't let this one slip by you.  The acting is a bit cheezy, but it's easy to live with. Also whoever ran the cameras had some of the actors bodies chopped out of the scenes.  For example, you will hear people talking but you won't see who's talking.  This takes place in several scenes. Kind of distracting, but it doesn't take nothing away from this action-packed flick!

This one starts out with a vicious fighting scene.  A family was viciously murdered and had their precious Green Jade Statuette (The Jade Monk) stolen by three ruthless thieves (The Three Tigers).  Unknowingly to these killers, a daughter hid in the the closet quietly and watched her family being killed execution style by these three bandits who vowed they would meet in exactly one year in Stone Village to sell the statuette and split the proceeds among them.  After overhearing this, the daughter hired a professional killer (Chin Chang) to retrieve her family's precious statuette. and to wipe out The Three Tigers.  I call him the man in white, because he always wore white throughout the picture.  This killer is awesome.  He carries this very short brass pole/stick around that has a blade in the center of it.  I have never seen anyone use or swirl a weapon like this before.  Anway, anyone who comes up against him is at his mercy with this weapon.  He even stated on one occasion that if anyone opposes him they will get one result, ""and that's death!""

Although the daughter wanted her family's precious Green Jade Statuette back, the real motive for hiring Chin Chang was to take revenge on the Three Tigers who wrecked her household.  She poses as a prostitute in a brothel in Stone Village waiting for the moment to seek her revenge.  Chin Chang never knew that she was the one who hired him until near the end of the movie.  Also, the madam (Pearl Lee) of the brothel, who is the younger sister of the eldest of The Three Tigers, knew about the statuette.  Chin Chang believed that if he located Pearl he would also locate the statuette.  How?  You will have to watch the movie for that answer! Before long, you have other characters looking for this same statuette as well - such as Pearl's boyfriend (Wu Kang)- who is an excellent fighter, who soon discovers that his lying girlfriend is in fact related to one of the Three Tigers.

I just gave a small overview without giving too much away. There's much more to this action flick than what's stated here.  Judge for yourself.

This flick is filled with great fighting scenes and the plot carries throughout.  This kept to the plot and this is what I particularly liked about this one.  The cheezy acting and the voice overdubs are something to be desired though. If you can get past these two negatives you have a great 4-star flick.  In this one, you don't know who to trust and that what keeps your interest.  People are not who they apear to be. Hey, if you got to grab that snack, make sure you press the pause button or you'll miss something.",1140566400,3,3174,4.560070671378092
