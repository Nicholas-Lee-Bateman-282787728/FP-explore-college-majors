7958145,5,B0000633EX,"This VHS was rated ""Fantastic"" by Bass Player Magazine and for good reason. It should be released again, hopefully in both DVD and VHS form, since it offers so much for the aspiring bassist. For those unfamiliar with the name, Francis Rocco Prestia, he definitely created innovations for those playing electric bass. On this VHS, he demonstrates ghosting, muting, intervals, cross-string picking and raking. But this isn't just a demonstration of methods but also a look a liver performances of the Tower of Power. This blends the best of both worlds - pure technique as well as examples of how each is used in actual concerts!  If you have ever heard ""What is Hip"", ""Only so Much Oil in the Ground"", ""Soul Vaccination"" or ""You're Still a Young Man""...now you have the chance to play along with those songs. Suitable for both beginner and more advanced bassists.",1289088000,,862,4.863945578231292
7958146,4,B0000633EX,I and probably most aspiring bass funksters would snap this up if available in dvd format. Rocco's playing is as timeless as the groove; please disc it.,1188518400,,152,4.666666666666667
7958147,5,B0000633EX,"This is without question, my favorite video. Why? First, Rocco Prestia has such a unique style and his bass lines will be forever a model for enjoyment and study. In this video Rocco uses many of the Tower of Power classics to demonstrate his technique. I have come away with so many new ideas and methods, and each of the examples is so incredibly catchy and so inspiational. Rocco and his ""ghosting"" is such a challenge to emulate and master - and that there is only part of it. Even if his style is not for you, there is so much here to take back to the woodshed and incorporate it into your style. Thanks, Rocco. You are indeed a master.",1165881600,,641,4.305785123966942
7958148,5,B0000633EX,Fingerstyle funk is a great asset to any bass player. Rocco Prestia's style is one of a kind. The tape was very informative and gives the viewer an idea of the depth of Rocco's playing ability. A must for all bass players.,1163030400,,222,4.309523809523809
7958149,5,B0000633EX,"From the first day I watched this video, I have picked up so many musical ideas to apply to nearly every genre of music I play (and, being a military rock band bassist, I play a LOT of different genres).  This video will, without a doubt, help you become a better player.",1162598400,,271,4.211538461538462
7958150,4,B0000633EX,"Listening to Rocco play is amazing, but getting to see how he  approaches playing the bass is enlightening.  If you have ever seen Rocco play and wondered why he move around the neck so much this will answer that. How he plays all those sixteenth notes so cleanly. It also shows how he builds lines from simple motifs. This is a real education.",1050019200,3,344,4.444444444444445
7958151,5,B0000633EX,"If you're interested in funk bass, this is the tape to get. It's comprehensive, teaching basic to advanced techniques, all in in a logical and easy to understand fashion. The exercises are progressive, and with practice, easy to master -- even for someone lacking natural chops like me. Not only is Prestia an tremendous musician, more importantly, he's a superb teacher. I have a lot of bass instruction tapes, and I can tell you that this is one of the best. You're not learning someone else's mannerisms; you're learning a fundamental approach to the bass. You'll amaze your friends and you'll amaze yourself, and you'll save a ton of money learning what would otherwise require dozens of private lessons.",1026345600,,708,4.957983193277311
7958152,5,B0000633EX,"I had the honor of meeting Rocco several years ago and tried to pick his brain for the very material covered in this video.  At the time I don't think he thought much about it, he just ""did it"".  Somehow, the producers of this video were able to extract the information I've been hungry for all these years.  In a very contemplative fashion Rocco talks about what he listens for in a drum track and how he conceives his bass lines from the ground up.  What I like is that the material is not over-analyzed.  There is more demonstration than talk so you really see Rocco's artistic process in motion.  It has definitely changed my perspective of the instrument and its roll in the rhythm section.  This is an amazing piece of work - and a wonderful tribute to one of my bass heroes!",1021593600,6,781,4.381944444444445
7958153,5,B0000633EX,"I am a Rocco fan from way back - but I had no idea that this video even existed.  I wish I would have known about this sooner!  There is a ton of classic Tower-of-Power material that Rocco uses to demonstrate how his bass lines are constructed.  Rocco demonstrates the foundation of each bass line in the studio - which is often just a couple of notes.  He continues repeating the line against a rhythm track and elaborating a little bit each time - giving you clear insight into how he comes up with the bass lines that he does.  Once the groove is established, the video cross-dissolves to the same groove in a live performance with the band - very cool!  I have been trying for many years to emulate what I was hearing on those classic TOP tracks.  You have to see what he does to understand it, and this video cleared up the mystery for me. It is definitely the most complete and insightful video I have seen on Rocco's style - or any style for that matter!",1021593600,7,961,4.276243093922652
