This is one of those movies I watched, thought it was horrible, and 5 minutes later I could not remember a darn thing about it.  That is when you know a movie..., well, sucks.  It was not funn, just was there. Do not recommend.  Packaging was good, at least they hae that",1381190400,,328,4.078125
8340725,4,B001T6OPAK,"Baja Beach Bums made me laugh out loud! Chupacabra!
If you've ever gone on surf trips to baja, you'll enjoy this movie.
If you like surf culture and adult humor, check it out.",1271721600,,175,4.333333333333333
8340726,2,B001T6OPAK,"I guess it wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen, but it was pretty forgettable. It couldve been funny, it couldve been cool. It didn't really make it past either of those hurdles. I wouldnt call it a surf movie-as they only surf briefly in the end. Its just a bit dis-jointed and choppy. The proposal is the cheesiest thing i have ever seen in a movie. I don't think these situations would actually ever come up in someones life, and ive been to mexico!",1243382400,,456,4.313953488372093
8340727,5,B001T6OPAK,"Cool movie.  I am no film critic, I just happen to really like all the things covered in this film.  This is not a full on surf flick (i.e. it has a story beyond surfing), it is about some bros that hit baja and things get weird.  Seems vaguely familiar, but then I was never in my right mind when I used to camp and surf in Mexico...  Watch it in your sandy wetsuit",1241481600,3,366,3.9054054054054053
8340728,5,B001T6OPAK,"If you surf Baja, have ever traveled Baja or simply love a good indie, this is it. You'll love the surf scenes and the story is one we all face at some point in life!",1241481600,2,166,3.7714285714285714
