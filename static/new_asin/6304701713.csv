916522,2,6304701713,"This movie actually came out in 1968, not in 1973, and isn't too bad of a movie.  I would consider it worth watching, although it's definately still a B-movie.  There does seem to be an overall theme to the movie. It's not an ""anti-war"" war movie, but it does portray war as cruel and tragic.  The basic plot is that during WWII the Americans get together a select group of Italian-American commandos who are to parachute into North Africa on a secret mission and take over a post at a desert oasis that is being held by the Italians. After they do that, they pose as Italians for a couple of days while they wait for an American battalion to arrive for an invasion.  Meanwhile, while they are at the post disguised as Italian soldiers they also entertain some German officers who arrive for a visit. It's an ""Italo-German"" production and besides the two main American officers (actors Lee Van Cleef and Jack Kelly) the rest of the cast is mostly Italians and Germans. The Italian and German officers seem to be much more sympathethic characters than the American officers. Lee Van Cleef's character is suffering from flash-back nightmares due to his experience in the Pacific where his entire platoon of a hundred was killed at Bataan, (except for three people). He comes across as slightly crazed and somewhat ruthless. Jack Kelly's character is a ""green"" officer and has never seen combat. By the end of the movie, though, he seems slightly crazy and ruthless too. It seems clear that the movie is meaning to show the emotional scars of war and what terrible things can happen during war. There's several scenes where the Italians try to surrender with their hands up, and the American officers shoot them. The question of whether the American commandos should kill unarmed Italians who are surrendering, or else who are asleep in their beds, brings up some moral issues that the movie attempts to address. At the end of the movie, there's a big battle between the American commandos at the post and some Germans who have discovered their secret mission and who arrive in tanks. I don't want to give the ending away, but it's clear that the moral message in this movie about the tragic effects of war is there at the very end as well. Overall, I thought the action in this movie was suspenseful. At least it wasn't always predictable. Lee Van Cleef is a little over the top in his acting but the other actors in the cast aren't so bad. It's worth watching.",1231545600,2,2459,4.645977011494253
916523,3,6304701713,"Lee Van Cleef trades in his Stetson for an Italian uniform in this exciting WWII drama about a platoon of Italian-American misfits selected for a hazardous covert mission as part of Operation Torch in North Africa. The group must masquerade as Italian regulars in order to infiltrate the German/Italian command.  Sgt. Sullivan (Van Cleef), not only haunted by the ghosts of his past while formerly fighting the Japanese in the Pacific Theater, must also contend with inexperienced desk jockey, Captain Valli (Jack Kelly), who assumes command of Sullivan's green troops for the special mission. Serious conflicts arise not just between the two men, but also during the execution of the mission that ultimately jeopardizes the success of the secret campaign.

Some of the supporting players are quite good.  In a radical departure from most conventional war films of the day, the Germans are depicted not as Nazi savages blindly following Hitler's ideology destroying everything in their path for the Fatherland, but a rather humane, disaffected group of men tired of war and finding only camaraderie and friendship with their equally disaffected Italian allies as the only positive byproduct of a long and protracted desert campaign.  The German commander, for example, is portrayed as a former professor of entomology who seeks not personal glory for greater Germany, but merely wishes to return to the moths and butterflies in his university laboratory.

This Italian-German co-production was made in 1967, and is not to be confused with the lesser ""Desert Commandos,"" (see my review) an almost identical plotline, and made approximately around the same time 1967-68, with a unit of five German paratroopers in British uniforms trying to infiltrate the Casablanca Conference intending to assassinate Churchill, De Gaulle, and Roosevelt to thwart the Allies' rapid advance in North Africa.

""Commandos,"" while a mediocre film at best, is the better of the two and will, at least, hold your attention for its 95 minutes. This DVD transfer is relatively inferior boasting ""stereo sound"".....hardly--it looks like it was lifted off a VHS master, and I purchased the exact same DVD at the local Dollar-Tree for just 4 bits as opposed to the ridiculous $9.99 Amazon is charging here.  With enough explosions to make Sam Peckinpah  proud and some decent production values (Here, the tanks, while ultimately consisting of then-current 1960 American vintage are accurately depicted in desert camouflage!) along with  a very unusual but climactic ending, make this poor imitation and badly looped version of ""The Dirty Dozen"" at least worth a look.",1228435200,,2639,5.294258373205742
916524,3,6304701713,"I've seen a handful of Spaghetti Westerns, but I've never seen a Spaghetti World War II film.  Given that Italy was on the losing end of that particular conflict, I was curious to see how they would portray the event.

As it turns out, COMMANDOS is a relatively interesting war film -- if a little lacking in substance.  It's tense in places and exciting enough that I never felt bored.  There are better war films out there, but there are also worse.

During WWII, the Allies are putting together a very special raid.  The US Army has assembled a band of Italian-Americans -- all literate in Italian, and all knowing enough to reasonably pass for Italian solders.  The mission is to parachute into the northern Africa desert and take possession of a critical oasis.  Seems simple enough.  Except on the eve of the mission, the commander who was supposed to lead is replaced by a man with a lot of desk-bound experience, but no practical knowledge.

This infuriates second-in-command Lee Van Cleef (DEATH RIDES A HORSE and ""the bad"" in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY), who was not only very close to the original commander, but loathes the fact that he will be lead by an inexperienced yahoo.  In a previous mission, Van Cleef was nearly killed because of a know-nothing commander's bungling.  His determination to prevent history from repeating itself is what fuels Van Cleef's quietly bubbling anger.

Compared to other, more spectacular files of the genre, COMMANDOS does look a little on the cheap side.  But by relegating most of the action to the eponymous commandos, the director is able to wring a lot of tension out of very little money.  The film's most intense moments are split between the initial commando raids and the subsequent scenes in which the squad is desperately trying to fool passing convoys into believing that they are indeed all members of the Italian army.

I don't have much to say about the movie, because at the end of the day there isn't much to it.  It makes for exciting and entertaining viewing, but not much to think about afterwards.  There are numerous attempts to humanize both sides of the conflict and to make the commando's prisoners of war come across as sympathetic characters.  And while these moments are successful, they aren't especially original either.  Which pretty much sums up my opinion of the film's entirety.",1148947200,4,2365,4.792592592592593
916525,2,6304701713,"Normally I ignore bad movies and do not review them unless thay offend me. COMMANDOS offended me. It is poorly shot, poorly directed and the ""Germans"" all speak perfect English. This movie has a few decent action scenes, but overall it is just a B- movie about some WW2 commandos in Africa. I watch a lot of WW2 films and this one has to be the cheapest I have ever seen. Waste of time...even for 3.00",1141516800,,401,4.2894736842105265

St. Clair Vision have released this film in it's 2:35:1  widescreen ratio.

Not so much an anti-war film as, ""there are no winners in this war"" story. Picture quality is at best good though at times a little grainy.

A worthwhile purchase at a budget price, you can't beat it.

Lee Van Cleef is always worth a look.",1105056000,4,370,4.382352941176471
916527,2,6304701713,"As far as I know, this movie concerns some Italian-American commandos who must seize an Italian held oasis and masquerade as its garrison for two days in advance of some major American operation.  Now I would have been  happy if this film was a nice crackerjack action thriller.  But it isn't.  There's plenty of competently directed and edited action sequences and  explosions, but not much style to any of it.  Too bad really, there's some  decent production values in this film and Lee Van Cleef stars in it.  Unfortunately he's saddled with a half-baked role as hard-nosed veteran  Sergeant Sullivan, haunted by flashbacks of a botched mission in Bataan, in  which he was one of three survivors out of a hundred.  A failure he blames  on the pencil-pushing gloryhound officer who initiated it.  Thus, when the  inexperienced Captain Valli comes to take charge of the current mission,  Sullivan is naturally wary of him.  Not a bad concept, but one never too  deeply explored or meaningfully resolved, just scenes of Van Cleef and Jack  Kelly staring and growling at each other.  Hard to believe four  writers(including Dario Argento) are credited with this script.  The  usually fine Mario Nascimbene must have composed about five minutes of  original score, not a second of which is better than monotonous.  Then  there are the panzers, which are post-WW2 American tanks dressed up with a  desert paint scheme and Afrika Corps markings.  They rumble around the  background in some short sequences throughout the movie, then finally  brought to bear in the big finale.  And darn if they don't have more  presence than most of the actors!  The DVD is another D-Vision con job,  most likely mastered from videotape and looking as good as it.  But at  least it well last a long time, right?  Typical flimsy packaging and  inaccurate descriptions: the disk does contain chapter stops placed roughly  every 12 minutes.  If anyone cares.",944870400,14,1935,4.965408805031447

7876407,4,6304701713,"Most Italian war movies of the '60s & '70s were about some commando squad mission, as is this one, and very average at best. What sets Commandos apart from the rest is a good, building tension throughout the film that makes for more than the usual ""will they reach the objective and shoot it out"" vibe. The performances are all good, as is most of the technical aspects, except the model plane at the beginning, which is sub-standard even for a giant monster movie.
