340674,1,6301562216,"I love James Bond movies.  I love the Austin Powers trio.  When I bought this DVD, I thought it would be great (after all, Austin himself proudly endorsed it).  Make no mistake here.  This movie isn't that great!  I can't begin to describe the dissapointment I felt after wasting my life watching this pile of junk. The jokes are not funny.  James Coburn is vile.  I cannot even begin to buy into the premise that he is a super sexy spy.  If you are at the store and pick up this film, don't even think about it - PUT IT DOWN.  It is not worth your time.",1029024000,,554,4.102803738317757
340675,5,6301562216,"The second and final installment in the Flint series is an outrageous comic romp that showcases the flashy style of America's mod super agent, Derek Flint.  With a plot that just cannot be taken seriously, ""In Like Flint"" is an all out farce, that must be accepted as such, to be fully appreciated.
The story revolves around an elaborate scheme concocted by a group of women, running a health spa and cosmetics empire in the Virgin Islands, called ""Fabulous Face"".  Their plan is to assert female superiority over the male gender by replacing the President with a double.  Once this is accomplished, the substitute President will then aid them in the further execution of their master plan.  Head of ZOWIE (Zonal Organization World Intelligence Espionage), Lloyd Cramden (Lee J. Cobb) is playing golf with the President (Andrew Duggan), when the switch is made.  After becoming suspicious, Cramden asks Flint to look into the matter.  Derek is busy at work on a ""dolphin dictionary"", and also has his hands full with a new collection of beautiful dolls, but still has time to help an old friend in trouble.
From there, the fun never stops, as Flint jumps from one wild wacky adventure to another.  His foray into a ZOWIE warehouse, and the subsequent battle with the guards, is one of the film's highlights.  As is his unlikely side trip to Russia to perform in a ballet, where he encounters the lovely go-go dancing Natasha, played by Yvonne Craig, TV's Batgirl.  Rooftop escapades, and then it is on to Fabulous Face headquarters disguised as a Fidel Castro lookalike.  Romping in the tropics, leading an invading armada of bikini clad women, Flint saves the world again, and winds up in Earth's orbit with two female cosmonauts.  Only he could pull this off.
For pure escapist fun, it is hard to beat this.  Exotic locations, some lavish sets, and beautiful women.  Andrew Duggan is great in a dual role, and bumbling, grumbling Lee J. Cobb even sacrifices his moustache to appear in drag.  It is a film that captures and evokes the free flowing vibe of the time (1967).  Regrettably, this would be the last time James Coburn would appear as the character.  Oh what could have been!  The same could be said for the DVD.  While the transfer is excellent, the film receives just a ""plain Jane"" treatment with virtually no extras.  Plainly Fox just did not care.  MGM's SE Bond DVD's are the benchmark, and this lazy effort pales in comparison.  Fans of the Flint films should not miss the soundtrack with Jerry Goldsmith's music for both films on one CD.",1027900800,6,2555,4.774487471526196
340676,4,6301562216,"The sequel to the wonderful ""Our Man Flint"" is a bit less fun than the original, but still worthwhile nonetheless.
Women have been quietly taking over the world (well, the industrialized world, anyway) via thought control, and are now in a position to rule the planet. The president has been replaced by a doppleganger, and there are even traitors infiltrating ZOWIE Headquarters! Who else but Flint can save the day?
I have to admit, I couldn't always root for Flint in this one. All those bikini-clad beauties were nice, and can take over my world anytime!
The biggest disappointment here has to be during the confrontation between Flint and the leaders of the female revolution. The philosophical argument is never resolved, leaving our hero to simply tell the ladies to ""give it up,"" which was kind of a letdown.
The crisis facing ZOWIE chief Lloyd C. Cramden is nicely played by Lee J. Cobb. There are also plenty of quintissensial Flint moments (""Well there were five girls at one time, but I've been trying to cut down.""), and new Flint gadgets. We even get to see Yvonne Craig (forever famous as Batgirl) as Natasha, doing a swingin' 60's dance to ""decadent"" American music. Andrew Duggan makes a good President, and Jean Hale is suitably attractive as Flint's nemesis.
The best thing added to the Flint formula would have to be the theme song, updated with words. Hey, how can you NOT like a song called, ""Your ZOWIE Face""?
Sadly, there was no third outing for Flint, although there was a short-lived Flint television program in 1976 with different actors. The show did not have the same appeal as the feature films, and quickly faded into obscurity. While Austin Powers is a wonderful parody, he not exactly the heir apparent to super-spy Flint. The Powers films are not subtle spy spoofs, and it was that subtlety of Bond spoofing which Flint had captured perfectly.
Few extras on the two Flint DVDs (just the trailers), and again I have to say that Fox has let down the fans of Flint by neglecting to have commentary or interviews on these discs. On the plus side, the transfer is well done, and in widescreen.",1027382400,11,2122,4.737837837837838
340677,4,6301562216,"If only the Bond movies were this much fun.
DVD lovers now have their patience rewarded, thanks to the simultaneous releases of ""Our Man Flint"" and ""In Like Flint"".  Ever catch these two movies in widescreen on AMC network?  If you have, then you know what kind of fun you are in for with these two films.  These are spoofs but not in the ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" vein.  These spoofs are of the ""wink-wink nudge-nudge"" variety instead, never over-the-top enough as to be completely silly.  They poke gentle fun at the concept of a James Bond ""super-rich, super-intelligent, super-suave"" agent, but still let you enjoy the movie itself, rather than being a series of puns and sight gags.
But if puns and sight gags are what you want, then check out the Zucker Brothers' ""Top Secret"" with Val Kilmer, also due on DVD any moment now.",1025827200,6,831,4.625850340136054
340678,4,6301562216,"No microchips.  No GPS.  Come to think of it, no digital anything!  This escapist spy/thriller/sexy fantasy film captures a lot of really neat stuff from 1967 - A western world poised on the brink of a technological revolution, but not quite there yet - a world in the midst of a sexual revolution, and enjoying every second of it - In short, a world trying to make love in rockets designed with slide rules, all surrounded by really psychedelic furniture and art, while at the same time both cowering and rebelling under the threat of nuclear holocaust.
Of course, if you'd rather not see this movie this way, it still makes a wonderfully inane escape film, with lots of action and plenty of blocky, boxy 1960's bikinis.  James Coburn is perfect for the role of Flint, and most of the characters around him are at least able to muddle along enough to keep things (almost) believable.  But don't be fooled; it's the setting, the time, and the fantasy that was the mid-60's that makes this film what it is - the music score alone is worth the purchase, and the film embodies the idea that we can go to the moon, drive cars with fins, dance like we're going crazy and have all the unfettered sex you can shake a stick at without any consequences, all while waiting to be flash-cooked by the Russians, or maybe just by one of our own nukes gone awry.  No wonder the brilliant Mike Meyers quoted it so heavily - ""In Like Flint"" is the quintessential 60's spy fantasy film - edgy, questioning, ironic, sexy and really, really trippy.  Turn on to it; it will expand your mind, man.",1011484800,3,1575,4.505263157894737
340679,3,6301562216,"This is the sequel to Our Man Flint, another  spy-themed flick starring suave, hip, super-spy Flint  as a secret agent with all of Bond's moves and  more. . . or not. Derrick Flint is surely a man who  gets the job done when it comes to being a secret  government agent. . . but, hip and suave? Well let's  just say he is no match for James Bond. James  Coburn plays agent Flint and don't be fooled by his  tall and lanky appearance; all you spy-spoof fans  will still get what you expect. Yes, he still gets the  girls, saves the world, and manages to show off his  keen martial arts skills while doing so. Although  Coburn did learn martial arts from Bruce Lee, he  doesn't exactly appear as graceful. . . but then again  neither did Diana Rigg with her Judo chops in the  Avengers series (she sure did look cute, though). In  case you don't remember the first one, Flint had  been called out from retirement after he spoiled the  infiltration of Kremlin in Our Man Flint, but now it  was time for this dangerous man to settle down.  Well, apparently, a group of beautiful woman has  decided to overthrow the government using  subliminal brainwashing in beauty salons. Who else  is there but Flint to stop this diabolical scheme, and  so we get another taste of ""our man flint"". Although  there is not much originality in the film and the script  lacks a bit in both its comedic and dramatic  attempts, I will say that there are some pretty  alluring visuals. Take the girls for instance. . . they  are all sexy and look ultra-hip. The furniture in the  film is ultra groovy and just watching Coburn trying  to appear slick forces me to watch and giggle. He  may not be agent OO7, but if your looking for  amusement espionage style, this is the way to go.",974505600,7,1757,4.407523510971787
340680,4,6301562216,"The elements of the Flint formula really came together for the first time in this, the sequel to OUR MAN FLINT. James Coburn's superspy Flint inhabits a world somewhat more distant from reality than James Bond. Flint doesn't save the world for a living; it's more of a hobby, along with bullfighting, cooking, martial arts, desert survival, ballet, scientific research, and who knows what else. From the beginning to the final hairbreadth escape Flint is having fun, and so are we--Coburn seldom loses his infectious smile. The story stresses lighthearted adventure over real danger (come to think of it, I don't recall the bad guys ever actually killing anyone). But three decades later, the amazing thing about this movie is its progressive view of women and male-female relationships. The female characters are capable without losing their feminity. (And--who'd have thought it?--Flint has a few genuine words of wisdom on getting along with the opposite sex: ""I don't compete with them."") My favorite moment in the movie is Jean Hale rolling her eyes after Flint lights a woman's cigarette--watch for it! Why only four stars? Let's be real here. This is a fun movie, but it's no CITIZEN KANE.",971827200,15,1196,5.045454545454546

340706,5,6301562216,"One year after the success of Our Man Flint, which was released in 1966, comes In Like Flint. With a bigger budget, they don't do anything too radically different, although for some reason we don't even see James Coburn for the first 15 minutes of the film! Plot-wise, it jumps from one preposterous situation to another, barrelling along with an enormously silly plot, until we come to the sinister conclusion, with its double-crosses, triple-crosses, and reverse quadruple-crosses!! Unfortunately, it does lose a bit of steam at the end, and by the time we get to the final, conclusive battles, it just gets pretty lame. The final scene in the space pod with the pretty cosmonauts is fun, though!

The film has lots of great stuff! Sexy titles, lunge music, a seaside manor loaded with fashion strumpets. Funky president's two dogs, talking to dolphins, lots of ""baby"", and a gag with ""edible grubs"". Flint as matador painting. ""Euphoric acid"". Head in door stunt - awesome!! The ""Death of Derek Flint"". Moscow ballet scene, and plenty of boogying... baby!! Daring rooftop escape is simply amazing!! Cool Russian bouncing ball singalong at around the 1 hour mark. ""Eternity Now""! Women running the world... what a great idea!! Idiotic kung fu. Bowling ball attack. Operation Smooch. Not a great finale, though, and there's an awful space battle.

'Our Man Flint' was a parody, but it was a smart one.  It stood on its own.  If the writers of the sequel would've kept up that standard, there might well have been a dozen 'Flint' movies.  They went cheap instead; there are some good laughs and good lines, but as a whole 'In Like Flint' is as forgettable as 'Our Man Flint' is memorable.

If you want a *good* follow-up to Flint, get 'The President's Analyst'.  It's not a sequel, but it is a much smarter movie as a whole and it is loads of fun.",1369958400,,701,4.036231884057971

340763,3,6301562216,"In Like Flint(1967) is a good sequel, but it's not as fast paced or fun as the first film, Our Man Flint(1966). In Like Flint made money at the box office, but it also got mixed reviews. Also, movie theaters and TV were packed with spy adventures at the time. In Like Flint is cartoonish, offensive, and politically-incorrect about the way it portrays feminists. The film's title is a reference to the phrase ""in like Flynn"". In In Like Flint, power hungry feminists try to conquer the United States from a health spa in the Virgin Islands. The feminists work with Derek Flint after they're sold out by a man! Lee J. Cobb returns as Flint's superior, Mr. Cramden. The special effects scenes in outer space are pretty solid for 1967. In Like Flint is stylish and it has a solid, polished music score by Jerry Goldsmith. You can hear the original Flint theme during the climax. James Coburn returns as superspy Derek Flint. In Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me(1999), you can see Austin Powers watching this film on a TV set. In the Mexican soap opera Rubi(1968), you can hear stock music from In Like Flint. You can hear Goldsmith's jazzy-waltz music playing as Fanny Cano swims in a pool and puts on a fur coat! I like the sight gag with Derek Flint throwing a bowling ball at a bad guy and he slides down a bowling alley! Gordon Douglas directed In Like Flint.
Batman's Yvonne Craig made a cameo as a Russian girl. There's some dark humor as Cramden thinks he's holding Derek Flint's ashes in his hands! In Like Flint(1967) was a solid sequel, but it was considered a ""failure"" and the studio and James Coburn did not make a third Flint movie.",1329436800,,1647,4.511705685618729
340764,5,6301562216,"(WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD) A lot of people have weighed ""In"" that this was a weak sequel to ""Our"", but I thoroughly enjoyed this second outing for Our man Derek Flint.  I think this film has all of the charm of the first with a bit more campiness than the original. Some have considered it as campy as Batman, but I would compare it to 1966's Casino Royale, (but NOT THAT over the top).

Despite its supposed flaws and slow pace, I think ""In"" is actually a well directed well paced movie. Moreover, there are more fight sequences ""In"" this film with much better choreography. Also, Flint gets knocked around a little bit more here as well. ""Shall we try diplomacy?"" Yeouch!  Face facts, General Carter is much more villainous than the Rodney's of this world.
Plus you get some really great lines:

""LLoyd, I'll never turn my back on you""
""Brain and hair washing at the same time?""
""Get a load of this one,"" as Lee J Cobb ""infiltrates"" the island.
""An Actor as President?"" Remember this was 1967, one year later Ronald Reagan was elected Governor of California. Prophetic words? Perhaps.

A lot of people have commented that this killed the franchise, but from what I've gathered after the sequel, Coburn went off to do many an independent film, In fact, he produced his next feature The President's Analyst"" (another must see, despite its datedness). Finally, although it's sounds very '60ish ""In"" gives us a really catchy song: Z.O.W.I.E. Face.",1310169600,,1443,4.733067729083666
340765,3,6301562216,"This review pertains to the DVD whose cover is featured above.
""In Like Flint"" is not really a spoof of the then hugely popular James Bond series of films. It is instead the United States's answer to those movies with over-the-top spy plots. Take it for what it is: lightweight, amusing, psychedelic, 1960s. How could you dislike a film that has Lee J. Cobb in drag?
The disc (Zone 1, NTSC) is in anamorphic widescreen but the image is not quite as ""wide"" as the 2.35:1 ratio in which the movie was filmed. Colour and audio are of a good quality.
And by the way, Twentieth Century-Fox's ""In Like Flint"" of 1967 was the last film made in the CinemaScope anamorphic widescreen process. (The first was Fox's ""The Robe"" in 1953.) By the mid to late '60s, Panavision's widescreen process with its superior lenses had become the industry favourite.",1264291200,,842,4.657718120805369
340766,2,6301562216,"In Like Flint is perhaps best  remembered as the film that managed to kill  off  the Flint  'franchise' in a single blow (if you  ignore the  dire 1976  Canadian  TV movie, which is the  best  thing  to do with it). While it's wildly misjudged and considerably less successful than its predecessor  it isn't  quite  a  total washout even if its  attitudes have dated  horribly. In the opening half hour Coburn only has one scene, while the film strains a little too hard to be wacky and loses the straight faced charm of the original. With the exception of one excellent fight in a gym the action scenes are sloppier too. Then there's the sexism to contend with (although the notion of brainwashing the women of the world via hairdryers is ingenious), not to mention the sight of Lee J. Cobb in drag... Still, Jerry  Goldsmith does have fun providing nifty variations on his themes from the first film while generally adding a more Neal Hefti tone to the proceedings.

With  little in the  way of  extras other  than trailers on this single disc  edition, you're best off picking  up the Ultimate  Flint  three-disc collection instead.",1232755200,,1135,4.687179487179487

But, after I'd purchased the Ultimate Flint Collection and finally watched In Like Flint, I understood perfectly well. The movie is terrible. It's boring, corny, nonsensical and amateurish. I'ts idiotic plot is filled with third rate dialog and very little action. The first class camp and satire of the first movie is replaced by moronic skit comedy.

There is tons of action and very exciting scenes, James Coburn does it again for sure. Overall, a really great movie that has the feel of the 60s but yet hasn't aged.

340773,3,6301562216,"There's no way this movie could typify the sixties any more. From the playful flute-driven theme song, the glitzy cinematography, and Yvonne Craig's go-go dancing, (not to mention the OBVIOUS clapboard sets,) this is soooo ""Sixties"" it isn't funny! But it IS!

James Coburn is still a ""very funny fellow"", to quote Brendan Gill, in this second Flint outing. Though it doesn't have the feeling of serendipity that the first one had, where you thought you discovered, finally, a good rival for 007 in pop culture, it still does the espionage thing in typical Yank fashion, sans the pretension or affectations of an Ian Fleming novel. The two Flint movies were meant to be fun, and I will always wonder why in blazes 20th Century Fox didn't add at LEAST two other episodes to this franchise!

Of course, a good part of the appeal of Derek Flint is the way Coburn portrays him, as a true renaissance man to end all renaissance men, but a MODEST one! Flint doesn't act cocky unless he's in the company of a truly deluded bad guy, like Rodney or Sebastian (the actor in this movie), or General Carter. He's always a perfect gentleman around Cramden, his girlfriends, any OTHER ladies he encounters or military or political officials of obvious high standing. I've often thought to myself that the one factor of true genius is not to be self-conscious of your genius....that modesty is the one true harbinger of a truly inspired mind, and Coburn's portrayal of Flint bolsters that.

Anyway, the plot is simple: Cheeky cabal of ladies, fed up with the way men have been running the world, get together to embark on running it ""better"", or so they think, but still have to use MEN to make their dream come true, and it is this aspect of their plan that does them in. Once they get a view from the mountaintop, the two men that they have trusted turn on them and it's up to Flint to humble the overreaching females and take down the power-crazed men, and this he does with aplomb, at the behest of Floyd Cramden, played again by Lee J. Cobb. Cramden appears in drag in a few scenes in this film, trying to infiltrate ""Fabulous Face"", the Caribbean headquarters of the megalomaniac women, placed, oddly enough, in the Virgin Islands! Because of damaging photos taken of him in bed with what appears to be a prostitute, Cramden loses his position at Z.O.W.I.E., and has to recruit Flint to get to the bottom of it all. In one scene in this movie, as it's revealed that the ladies have placed an actor in the White House, impersonating the real President, Flint sits back and says: ""An actor...as PRESIDENT!?"" I'm sure every person who's ever seen both Flint movies wants Coburn to say, ""It's diabolical!!"" right afterward.

Fans of ""Dune"" will like the prescient use of sound as a weapon in this film, and everyone will like the Jerry Goldsmith score. However, one scene, where Flint is in Moscow dancing ballet with Yvonne Craig, and takes an improbable, slowish leap up to a balcony, might make the goings-on look a bit hokey, breaking whatever spell the movie might have had on you. People who thought ""Day of the Dolphin"" would ruin Mike Nichols' career, (and it almost did!) might wince at Flint speaking to one of the finny mammals in its own ""language"", compiling, believe it or not, a ""Dolphin Dictionary"".

However, like I said, Flint was 007's only true rival, and perhaps 20th Century should have given him a few more chances to impress us even more. I mean, this role pretty much did make Coburn the star he turned into....I would much rather have seen another ""Flint"" movie rather than ""Harry In Your Pocket"".

340774,2,6301562216,"I wanted to rent In Like Flint because it is mentioned in the Austin Powers movie. Reviews on amazon said that Our Man Flint was better, so I checked that one out first. I actually liked Our Man Flint. It was NOT what I expected though. People make it out to be a mockery or parody of james bond films, but I didn't think it was. When I think of parody, I think of Airplane or Naked Gun movies. This was NOTHING like those. Sure, there were a couple of funny things, like the name of the secret government agency was W.O.W.I.E. and he had his super tool that had 80 secret functions (of which you never saw him use more than maybe 6). Our Man Flint had an interesting story, and you honestly wanted to know what happened next. Even though it's a fairly old movie, it didn't seem as dated as it could have been. I liked Our Man Flint and I would watch it again.

BUS, In Like Flint? What a bad movie. It had hardly anything of the interesting story that Our Man Flint had. In fact, I didn't even watch the ending, because I DIDN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED! I should have known, In Like Flint got some pretty bad reviews here, but after watching Our Man Flint and enjoying it, I figured, how bad could it be? Well, it was pretty darn bad! Boring AND un-interesting. I would NOT reccomend In Like Flint, but I would reccomend Our Man Flint.

I know---you're saying: ""Aw, where's your sense of fun? It's a comedy. You know, it's a parody of spy movies.""

Wrong. ""Our Man Flint"" was a parody of spy movies. ""In Like Flint"" is a parody of itself---a mindless, talentless puffball of a movie floating along on its predecessor's slipstream.

The producers must've been so high on the first movie's success, they thought they could do no wrong. Or maybe they just flew off on vacation and left everyone to do whatever they wanted. Watching this mess, it's entirely possible.

A ludicrous, unfunny plot (women try to take over the world, then the men who were helping them decide they want to take it over instead, completely invalidating the first premise, zzzzzzzzzzzz...); positively awful dialogue; home-movie-style cinematography (not one creative shot in the whole picture); squirmingly clowny fight sequences; high-school film-class lighting; sets positively cluttered with wooden non-actors; a maddeningly lilting, cloying score that defies anything happening onscreen...

And through the whole thing, there's James Coburn strutting around giving us his ""It doesn't matter how bad this movie is, I'm so cool"" smirk, like a smarmy lounge singer on the Titanic.

A parody needs some semblance of intelligence, of imagination, of planning, of technical proficiency. Oh, and of humor. This has none of that.

Proclaiming a movie a parody isn't an excuse for plain bad filmmaking. This is just a bad, bad, movie. Bad.",1091923200,6,1539,5.206477732793522

340777,4,6301562216,"Derek Flint is one of a kind with his gadgets, beautiful girls, Karate, Ballet dancing, deductive mind plus sheer audacity, extreme resourcefulness and extreme coolness under fire. After Flint, well, Bond is kind of...boring if you know what I mean. Lee J. Cobb is very funny as his Boss and you even get to see him in drag at one point. No, he's not a poofter but he is in disguise. At the start, Lee J. Cobb is set up by the sexy No. 2 henchwoman in a honey trap after being drugged with a powerful narcotic in an Italian restaurant. Discredited and suspended, he desperately calls for Flint's help. Derek comes to the rescue of Cramden with exciting and hilarious results. James Coburn in a send up of Fidel Castro is super and must not be missed. The fight scene is very exciting and in real life, James Coburn had martial arts training from Bruce Lee himself, and it shows. The Karate is Hollywood showy but can be used in real life and death situations. The two big fight scenes are very well done. With bare hands and improvised weapons, Flint overcomes all. I just love the scene when his Boss asks him what happened to the 4 girls he used to have and Flint answers nonchalantly, ""I'm trying to cut down"". In the story,the President of the USA is replaced by a look alike under the control of the real No. 1 bad guy. Shades of Saddam Hussein! The women think they have everything in control but it is the US Army officer who they think are under their thumb that has the upper hand. Not for long when Our Man Flint appears and soon all the bad guys get what they so richly deserve. The world is saved by a super hero. Can one man make a difference? YES! There are times throughout history when one man can and has made a difference. The scene where Flint in a delightful sendup of Fiel Castro hijacks the Russian plane enroute to Havana is great! He pretends to give 2 live chickens to the pilots and then ties them up, literally. Flint then infiltrates by parachute the enemy base in the Virgin Islands! The finale is somewhat unbelievable but entertaining nonetheless as Woman Power overcomes all the male bad guys. Men have one terrible weakness unless they are poofs and that is their testosterone. A beautifully seductive girl leaves them weak kneed and malleable. Deadlier than the male indeed. See it soon. It'll make your day.

James Coburn is Derek Flint, the most skilled, diverse, cultured, bon vivant spy ever. He can do anything, such as engineering, kung fu, desert hiking, and performing ballet in Russia.
The style of this widescreen epic is amazing. The special effects are very well done for the time, and are even now hard to detect. Flint is every inch a chauvinist pig, so if you want to see women kicking [rear], this is not the film for you, as Flint has three women who serve his every need and are basically helpless without him.
If you are a fan of the Austin Powers movies, then you may well be in familier territory here.
This film has a ton of tongue in cheek humor, and is a very enjoyable watch.
The DVD also features several trailers, and is very well done for a no-frills package. The transfer is gorgeous, and the compression of the video signal is top-notch.

Having said that, I gotta say that ""In Like Flint"" unquestionably, hands down is the STUPIDEST movie I have EVER SEEN!!!  I mean, this movie makes ""Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama"" look like ""Citizen Kane"".  Ineptly acted, directed, and plotted (plot?  Did you know that there is a top secret missile base in the Virgin Islands [which, by the way, look suspiciously like a Hollywood back lot]?  And that a group of megalomaniacal beauty spa owners based there are taking over the world by means of secret brainwashing programs which they have incorporated into women's hair dryers, which permit them to control female Russian cosmonauts aboard a nuclear space platform?  I didn't.)  The villains in this movie are all completely and entirely brain-dead (just as Austin Powers reminded us), and the heroes are not far behind.  The stunts and fight sequences are BEYOND SILLY.  Nothing makes ANY SENSE!  Talk about ""suspension of disbelief""--you have to suspend it from a crane.  ""Gilligan's Island"" looks like Hamlet compared to this movie.  I spent the entire time with my mouth hanging open, in absolute awe and disbelief, being sure that it JUST COULDN'T get any stupider, and being constantly amazed that, indeed, it SURE COULD!  This is the movie Ed Wood would have made if he had a big enough budget, and I say this as a guy who has all of Ed's movies on videotape.

7813264,5,6301562216,"Well this is the second and last movie of Derek Flint played by James Coburn. Reading these reviews I just realized there was another attempt to resuscitate Derek Flints career in another movie (Dead on Target) 1976 with a different actor. I never knew that until now. WOWIE ZOWIE! I have to check it out.
If you like campy and tongue in cheek flicks then you will love these Flint movies. I have both Flint movies and I still watch them a couple times per year, just because of James Coburn. What an actor. The essence of cool and suave demeanor. Man I miss him and there is no actor like him today.
Not much I can add that hasn't already been written in other earlier reviews. Watch it.",1483920000,,688,4.341085271317829

7813266,5,6301562216,"Watch James Coburn one up Sean Connery in this excellent movie of this type. If Bond has one Bond girl Flint has three. Bond has a speed boat, then Flint must have a jet......right. Flint's goal is not to defeat a Spectre like foe, but to best the bond franchise. It does it brilliantly.",1473465600,,287,4.333333333333333
