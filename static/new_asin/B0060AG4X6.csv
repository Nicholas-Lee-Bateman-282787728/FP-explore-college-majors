Excellent classic kung-fu movie with rudimentary sword fight choreography, but excellent special effects for its days in terms of punctured eyes or sliced off limbs, etc.  I have to say the acrobatic movements in the fight scenes were well done, especially when the female student was climbing the pagoda tower.  The story line was easy to understand and a good one too.  The Lady Hermit is a top tier sword fighting kung-fu master and a highly recognized female fighter whom everyone is afraid of due to her reputation as unbeatable.  She also represent goodness.  Her last fight with a bad guy who is currently the number one fighter (even has his own #1 flag hanging on top of his pagoda tower), the Lady Hermit has been in hiding for three years while trying to heal from her injuries due to that last fight.  No one knows where the Lady Hermit is, but she's been serving as a maid at a security company.  The only person who knows her secret is the old man who is the executive of the security company.

One day a female fighter comes to town and is in search of the famous Lady Hermit.  The young woman's father sent her in search of Lady Hermit to convince her to become this young woman's new kung-fu master as the young woman wants to one day be the best fighter and carry on a legacy similar to Lady Hermit.  However, this young woman is a bit immature, and while in her search forces the Lady Hermit to rescue her and have to be on the run again.  When the Lady Hermit was a maid, the head of security at the company fell in love with her, but she tried to not get involved in the relationship.  The young woman eventually convinces the Lady Hermit to be her master, but she falls in love with the head of security.  Soon a love triangle is formed, but not everyone knows that it exist.  This romantic debacle causes a rift between the three, which motivates the young woman to try her new kung-fu that she learned from the Lady Hermit on the current #1 kung-fu fighter (bad guy) who has been searching for the Lady Hermit to kill her.",1520553600,,2092,4.397402597402597

8490219,5,B0060AG4X6,"Cheng Pei-Pei (old lady in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) looked so great in this movie, an all star cast. I am also a big fan of Lo Lieh (Five Fingers of Death), this film really brought back memories of doing Kung Fu (not even) with my little Sister and friends after watching them until somebody cried and I got a beating from my Parents, or managed to escape until later.",1520208000,,376,4.385714285714286

8490221,3,B0060AG4X6,"There's way too much fighting and simply not enough character development and that's not just a shame, it's a crime when you've got Cheng Pei-Pei and Shih Szu. It's poorly done and wastes the 2 main female leads but if all you want is a bunch of swordfights, it'll do.",1385337600,,268,4.38
