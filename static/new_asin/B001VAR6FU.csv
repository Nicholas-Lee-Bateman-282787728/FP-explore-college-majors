I had a little trouble to find more than four episodes on each DVD, however, once I hit the arrow to the RIGHT of ""Main Menu,"" they appeared.  This is not something an adult will likely watch more than once. (OK, maybe some will...potty humor never grows old for some of us!)",1421366400,,543,4.42

despite being released in the new millenium, it has the distinct feel of the old 90's cartoons. it will likely appeal more to kids younger than teenage age (or those who were young teens in the 90's), however many of the jokes are more ""grown up"", or rather that only adults would get them.

i should also note that there are several scenes in which one might say ""wait, did they just do what i think they did?"" such as the episode where ZeroMan faces off with his one weakness: anti-static sheets, which cause his suit to malfunction, and cause ""embarassing bulging"". his sidekick (the ambiguously gay Ty Cheese) then instructs him to find the suit's override, after which you see ZeroMan reach down his pants and fumble around for the switch (off-screen. this IS a ""kids show"" at heart).

none of this detracts from the show for ME, but i know my mother wouldn't have let me watch it back then, what with the ""sexual innuendo"" and a gay guy in the mix. but if you are uncomfortable with this sort of thing, then you may not want this cartoon for your kids.

something i found strange was that, although Leslie Neilsen was the main character in this (in both voice and name), it was Ryan Reynolds' name at the top of the DVD (he plays the voice of Ty). i thought maybe he had Produced the show, but didn't see his name in the credits other than for voicework.

all-in-all, this is an amusing series, and every episode put a smile on my face at some point. Les is your stereotypical superhero, except that all his powers come from the suit, and his propensity for being clumsy is offset by his incomprehensible luck, which ensures he always stops the badguys in the end, even if it's not the way he planned it  :)",1385424000,,1736,4.460567823343848
