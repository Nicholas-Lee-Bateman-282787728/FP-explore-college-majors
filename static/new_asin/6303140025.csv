7838826,5,6303140025,"A longtime fan of Conway; seen him in concert only one time.  His music has been  mainstay in our family (mom is a big fan; has over 26 of his orignal record albums) for years.  Grew up listening to the old country honky tonk and steel guitars and miss them terribly in todays music. When I located this  video of his,I did not hesitate to purchase.  The price was exceptionally low, which made it even sweeter.  The song list is wonderful.  All the 70's and early 80 hits.  I even kept a VCR for this product only.  I will be back to buy more of Conway items from this seller, as well as what Amazon has to offer.  We do not care if they were #1's or not, his voice, highs and lows and the steel guitar is what we love.",1247097600,,720,4.042553191489362
7838827,5,6303140025,"Every Conway fan knows how much he avoided TV. He rarely appeared on high-profile talk shows either. The only TV shows he was willing to do were ones where he never had to talk or give out too much personal information. He appeared on tons of ""Hee-Haw"" and ""Pop Goes the Country"" episodes as well as ""That Nashville Music"", ""Nashville On the Road"", and ""Nashville Now"". A chunk of ""Pop Goes the Country"" is featured throughout. The video opens up with a half performance of ""It's Only Make Believe"" from the mid '70s as a sort of warm-up. The name of the video is ""#1 Hits"" and it offers a small sampling of his chart-toppers. He had 55 by 1990...only 11 are on here obviously. There is an error, however. ""Rest Your Love On Me"" was NOT on the video i've got even though it's listed on the back of the box. The off-camera narrator is either J.R. Nelson or Bill Lowery. The program that i have contains:1. It's Only Make Believe (partial mid '70s performance; 1958 pop #1)2. I'd Love to Lay You Down (1980 #1)3. Hello Darlin' (1985 performance; 1970 #1) 4. I See The Want To In Your Eyes (1974 #1) 5. Touch the Hand (1975 #1) 6. You've Never Been This Far Before (1973 #1) 7. I Can't Believe She Gives It All To Me (1977 #1) 8. Don't Take It Away (1979 #1) 9. Tight Fittin' Jeans (1981 #1) 10. The Clown (1982 #1) 11. Slow Hand (1982 #1)",1074902400,12,1336,4.2637795275590555
