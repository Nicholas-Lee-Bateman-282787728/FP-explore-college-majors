2918222,5,B000UAE7RC,"My 2 year old daughter loves this video.  It has four Dora episodes:  Dora's Got a Puppy, Save the Puppies, ABC Animals, and Grandma's House.  In the Save the Puppies episode, Dora counts up to 100 as she searches for keys.  In the ABC Animals episode, Dora searches for animals each starting with different letters of the alphabet.  Teaches numbers and the alphabet- a great combination on one video.",1205193600,42,401,4.753623188405797
