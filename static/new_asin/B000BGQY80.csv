8086548,1,B000BGQY80,"This film is a disaster. It looks like it was filmed a hundred years ago. And even worse, it told me nothing about the American Propaganda Machine. I recommend that you not purchase films from A2ZCDS.com or bignewsnow unless you are still living in the past.",1381104000,,258,4.630434782608695
8086549,5,B000BGQY80,"This DVD is new and why, Amazon, is it not available? Perhaps we the American people could learn something from the past. Like how propaganda has been shoved down our throats before, just like it is happening now, but in much more subtle, sophisticated, think-tank supported ways. Whether it is communism or terrorism, the propaganda machine always has something for you the sheeple (sheep/people) to fear so that you can look to your big friendly government to protect you in these times of trouble (which they created btw) I give this DVD 5 stars for reminding us that we need to question politicians MORE not less and that doing so is patriotic and protected by the 1st Amendment, something the politicians want you to forget about.",1181088000,,735,4.841269841269841
