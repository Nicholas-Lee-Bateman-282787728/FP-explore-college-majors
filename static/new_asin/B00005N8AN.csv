1629416,5,B00005N8AN,"This video is the only one of the many, many I've tried that's motivated me to stick with it. Only 10 minutes a day is required to get results. The exercises are so well cued by Tamilee, that my chronic back pain is relieved rather than aggravated. I highly recommend this video to beginners, especially to those with chronic tension as well as to those with chronic back problems.",1104796800,26,381,4.536231884057971
1629417,5,B00005N8AN,"I like this DVD very much.  The DVD has three seperate stretching routines done standing, on a chair, or on the floor.  While each set works basically the same muscles, I find the variety terrific.  Some days I pop in the video and just stretch after a workout, then I'll use the floor or standing sections.  Sometimes I feel like doing the chair routine.  The variety is great, and can be used in conjunction with another routine or alone when you just want to relax and unwind.",1099526400,12,479,4.459770114942529
1629418,5,B00005N8AN,"I have always had to work hard to do even simple stretches. After I injured my lower back in martial arts doing the repetitive kicking motions, stretching not only became challenging, but it was also painful. Physical therapy and traction didn't help. Spinal steroid injections for pain management didn't help. I tried ""beginning"" yoga and Pilates, but they were too difficult. I was ready to give up when I found this DVD with Tamilee. After only one session, I felt great! You can do 10-minute segments or combine them for a 30-minute session, which is what I would recommend for days you haven't done much exercise. Tamilee is a down-to-earth instructor and shows you how to gradually and safely build your range of motion. She also builds confidence in this no-pressure routine.",1039996800,67,782,4.931818181818182
1629419,5,B00005N8AN,"Usually I get bored watching the same video after a few times. But this one is the one I'd go back to regularly. I appreciate the techniques in this program targeting shoulder,arm, hip areas specifically. As I recently experienced severe neck and shoulder pain, these are tremendously beneficial to me. I used to only know stretching could only be done on the floor or with a ballet bar but now I learned from this program that we can stretch effectively while sitting and standing!!

I especially love the beautiful scenery and music in this DVD: The first section was performed on the beach with a magnificent ocean view; The second section was done in a so peaceful garden full of luscious green with that new age kind of music!  Total tranquility!!!  It makes me feel like taking a mini vacation doing the stretching. I do get turned off if the background or outfits are not appealing.

It could be a bit too easy for some people but this is for beginners.  And on the days that I am too tired or just don't feel like, this low impact relaxing program is just what I need.",1032739200,15,1076,4.4974358974358974
1629420,5,B00005N8AN,"Tamilee Webb's Total Stretch for Beginners is one of the best exercise DVDs or videos that I have ever purchased.  I love it, and here's why:
The first section, titled Total Body Stretch for Beginners, consists of three 10-minute stretches.  You can do all three or just do one.
The first stretch is called the standing stretch.  This is for those of you who don't like to have to get down on the floor for exercising.  You do all the stretching from a standing position.  It also helps develop balance.
The second stretch is called the sitting stretch.  You do the whole thing while sitting on a chair.  This one requires a sturdy chair that won't tip over when you sit towards one side or the other.  This one is for anyone who doesn't want to get down on the floor for exercising, but might not have enough balance to do the standing stretch.
The third stretch is called the floor stretch--and as the name implies, you do it while sitting on the floor.  This is my personal favorite since it requires no balance so I get the best possible stretch.
Any one of these three stretches is complete on its own, but if you feel a need for a longer stretch, you can do all three.
The second section of the DVD is titled Beginners Stretch for Flexibility.  It consists of one 30-minute stretch that includes a short relaxation exercise at the end.  This one is a bit more challenging, but you feel SO good at the end.  Try the other stretches first, and work up to this one.
On a daily basis, I do the floor stretch (10 minutes) after my cardio workout.  This provides me with the best stretch.  Every once in a while, I'll do the standing stretch instead of the floor stretch.  Sometimes only once a week and sometimes more, I do the 30-minute stretch.  I especially love to do the 30-minute stretch if I've had an especially stressful day or if I want to get really relaxed.  :-)
The best part of these stretches is that I can do them.  They are not all super-easy, but all are doable--even for someone just starting out like me.  :-)  Tamilee Webb is a wonderful instructor.  She is encouraging and has a very soothing voice, but without being overly enthusiastic the way that many exercise instructors are.  This is one exercise DVD you'll actually use.",1025913600,6,2251,4.465686274509804

I love that the first 30 mins is broken up into 10 minute segments and the second one 30 mins. Since I am a golfer and like to stretch before playing, I make time in the morning for the 30 minute segment. By warming up my muscles, I am never sore after 18 holes and definitely feel more flexible while playing. When time is limited and feel the  need to stretch, I turn to the 10 min segments.  They are broken up into standing, sitting and floor - all good and effective.  Highly recommend!",1462060800,,578,4.18018018018018

Some of the DVD was okay, but there was too much stuff that required me to get on my knees, so I was not able to do those stretches.  Hope this saves other folks with knee replacements the cost of this DVD!",1458000000,2,370,4.257142857142857
1629508,5,B00005N8AN,"First the kudos: I highly recommend this stretch DVD for beginners. I try to do one of the 10 minute programs on the weekend. Like many others, my job has me sitting in front of a computer most of my work day. When I do one of the programs even few days in a row, my body feels better. Tamilee has cleverly come up with 3 different 10 programs that stretch the same muscles: a standing program, a sitting down program, and a floor program. I appreciate the shortness of the programs - while one might not have 30 minutes to stretch, most folks can find 10 minutes in a day to do one of the programs. I like having 3 different short programs to choose from.

Now for my complaints: there are few times Tamilee forgets her script and stumbles. Sometimes she talks for a longish time while holding a pose, perhaps longer than she might have meant to. Some of her talk is a little annoying when you hear it over and over.

But if you haven't stretched in awhile or are a beginner to stretching I highly recommend this video and think you will find it helpful, I sure have.",1457913600,9,1068,4.25615763546798
1629509,5,B00005N8AN,"This is the best stretching workout I've ever done! I love this, it's so much better and easier to do than the ""A.M./P.M. Stretch"" video with Madeleine Lewis. (That one is not meant for anyone with little to no flexibility. And there are no modifications given for beginners.) Alternatively, Tamilee explains each stretch and what muscles are being worked and to not get discouraged if you cannot do it fully. After the first time I used this workout, my shoulders felt so much better! I have Tendonitis in both of them which causes them to tighten up frequently and reduce my range of motion. This video has done more for me than the massage therapist at the Chiropractor's office. I want to thank those reviewers on the aforementioned video's product page who suggested this DVD. Along with post-workouts, this program will also come in handy after snow shoveling...as it's snowing now as I write this review!  I bought my copy through a 3rd party seller called: Standing Ovation. I received it just 4 days after ordering and it's in perfect working order. I only mention this due to there being reviewers who received copies that did not work properly in their DVD players.
Highly recommend this workout for beginners or those with flexibility issues.",1456790400,4,1254,4.859813084112149
1629510,5,B00005N8AN,"I bought this for my outdoorsy mom who at once scoffed ""for beginners!"" when I handed her the dvd. I told her it had high reviews on amazon and she gave it a shot. She liked the instructor's style and got hooked. After doing this daily for a week or two she noticed a huge reduction in the soreness and stiffness she has in her back muscles (she even used to complain that back massages were painful because of her knots). I love this video for myself too - I do yoga every now and then and I find my body is about as invigorated after these stretches as is the case from a yoga class.

I was about to buy it when I noticed an alert from Amazon saying ""you purchased this video in 2008"" so I looked in the closet. LOL Now you know the kind of workout junkie I am, good intentions and not so great on the follow through.

Well, here's the good news. I have been doing the 3 routines (a total of 30 minutes per day) religiously for over 3 weeks. My deltoid is completely healed and I can once again swing a golf club. Also, I'm not bored and I actually look forward to my morning routine with Tamilee. She's easy and encouraging. 4 stars because I feel like some of the stretches could be held a little longer.

My doctor advised me to go to physical therapy, but I'm not insured for PT.  He suggested a do-at-home stretching routine.  I found this DVD and it is exactly what I needed!  The full body session takes about 30 minutes and ends with relaxation.  Tamilee encourages good posture and proper technique throughout the session, and reminds the viewer that the stretches will become easier with time.  After my first try, I really felt better.

When we started, my daughter had a lot of back problems & pain.  At first, she was only able to bend at the neck.  After a short time, she was able to bend from the hips to a 90 degree angle!  She has been pain-free for years.

I am in my mid-60's and had frequent falls before working out with the video.  Since I've done the stretches, my falls have decreased substantially.  I rarely even trip anymore -- and I can regain my balance to save myself from falling.  This is important to me, as I have osteoporosis & a fall can be serious.

What is frustrating is that she is shown by the camera at different angles so that I think I am in the correct position, but then the camera shows her facing another way, and I find myself scrambling around to be in the correct position.

This happens in all the segments, so that at times I am also moving my chair around and having to stop the DVD and go back and redo something.

1629725,4,B00005N8AN,"I've returned to working out after a long, long period of not working out, and I am slowly increasing my fitness level. When I tried Tamilee's Total Stretch, I have to admit, I wasn't initially very impressed. I didn't much care for her banter (I get it; tennis players and computer users need to stretch!), and didn't find the program itself that great. As other reviewers have noted, she doesn't hold stretches for very long, her routine is pretty standard and non-creative, plus she repeats many of the same stretches in each of the three 10 minute segments (standing, seated and floor), so stringing them together for an extended session isn't very exciting.

However, I saw the true value of Tamilee's program when I started using it to get my aging parents into moving their bodies more. Total Stretch for Beginners - or in this case, sedentary seniors - really can be a challenging, satisfying way to start moving regularly. My parents loved the lush forest setting and the beautiful beach backgrounds. They both needed some modifications (which weren't included), but did well with the pacing, including the short holds and down time between stretches. It just goes to show how subjective these reviews truly are!

Overall, for true beginners, I think this is a great option. It would be a five-star offering with a bit more explanation of proper form and modifications included for the less innately flexible. For ""advanced beginners,"" consider looking elsewhere.",1372032000,3,1472,5.004081632653061

1629749,5,B00005N8AN,"This stretching video is a great find. It works for beginners or people with a little more experience. Tamilee has a relaxing and calm demeanor and nice voice. She goes at a great pace and demonstrates all of the stretches, and she also demonstrates ""modifications"" for people who are not as flexible. The first half of the DVD is broken in to three parts, each around 10 minutes long. There is a standing stretch routine, a sitting stretch routine, which you can use a regular straight back chair (although I had to use a shorter stool because I am only 4'10"" tall and you want your feet to reach the floor) and there is also a floor stretch. You can watch all of them for a 30 minute long stretching routine, or pick one of the routines to do for just 10 minutes. The last half of the video is a dynamic stretching routine that goes through standing stretches then floor stretches, keeping you constantly moving. It ends with around 3 minutes of visualization/relaxation which could bei helpful right before bedtime. This is Not a workout video, it is just stretching.",1368144000,2,1070,4.607329842931938
1629750,5,B00005N8AN,"This is a great produce. I am not a yoga (meditation, spiritual...) buff and most stretching videos are deeply about yoga. I wanted a good full body stretching video without something that resembles delving into spirituality - I already have a religion and I don't want another.

I am an absolute beginner and this video did not make me feel rushed nor was it so easy that I didn't have to ""push the envelope"" a little bit.  Very informative and when I was done just the first segment, I felt as if I had done an actual work out - only without the ""pump it up, push it hard, hurry hurry hurry"" spiel of most actual exercise workouts.",1367280000,8,633,4.3559322033898304

1629754,2,B00005N8AN,"I was so anxious to begin this DVD and was pleased to see that the Stretch for Beginners came in 10 minute segments.  I thought I would try the entire three segments and thought the first two segments, standing stretch and sitting stretch were very good.  However, when it went into the floor stretching segment, all that was on the dvd was the very end of the segment - maybe 5 seconds.  I tried everything to find it, but it was missing.

The instructor is very good and the segments are easy to follow and really do a nice stretch on the body.  So disappointed that the dvd itself was not in its entirety.",1363737600,3,608,4.298245614035087

The three ten-minute segments are comprehensive enough on their own.  Many of my workout DVDs have very rushed (sometimes just 30 seconds) stretching after a tough routine, but I need more.  When I am pressed for time, choosing one ten-minute segment adequately stretches my entire body.

On the other hand, all three vignettes are different enough that when I have time for more (i.e. Saturday mornings), I can do the entire 30 minutes without getting bored.  It's definitely something I look forward to each week.  I liken it to that ""aaaahhhhhh"" feeling of finally getting to sit down after hours on my feet.

Tamilee's commentary is informative and encouraging (never sappy and annoying).  With options for standing, sitting or floor stretches, this DVD is appropriate for most abilities and age groups.  There is also an additional segment for flexibility.  I've not tried that yet, but hope to get there soon.

Though the title says it's for beginners, fitness buffs of all levels will definitely benefit from this DVD.  I know I'll be using this for the long-term.",1363737600,3,1341,4.828947368421052

1629801,5,B00005N8AN,"I highly recommend this stretch video for beginners and overweight exercisers! I'm a beginning-intermediate exerciser, about 50 pounds overweight and with fair-to-moderate flexibility. I mention that because I found this video particularly doable and effective. Some other stretch videos I have tried (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AM-PM-Stretch/dp/B00007D00L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AM & PM Stretch</a>) have had too many maneuvers where my extra weight (especially in belly and thighs) really got in the way of being able to get into the position properly and do the stretch effectively. I am able to do all of Tamilee's stretches, and really feel my muscles releasing and lengthening.

Tamilee is an excellent instructor. Her explanations of how to get into each posture are clear, and she is very good about articulating exactly where I should feel each stretch. For many stretches, she demonstrates several modifications for people with greater or less flexibility; I find that I can do some of them at a more advanced level and for others need an easier modification. She is affirming about doing -- and enjoying -- the stretch at whatever level I can, in a way that helps me avoid feeling discouraged about the stretches where my flexibility is more limited. Her manner is warm and friendly, and she is encouraging without being chirpy.

I regularly use one of the 10-minute sections to finish my cooldown following a cardio workout, and have found the 10-minute floor stretch to be especially useful after aero-toning with hand weights -- there's a deltoid stretch that is absolutely amazing after I've been working the shoulders and back! The second ""stretching for flexibility"" 30 minute segment is fantastic for an evening stretch, after I've been parked behind a computer all day. For evening stretches I alternate this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strong-Knees/dp/B001D261TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strong Knees</a>&nbsp;and the the warmup/stretch section from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HeavyWeight-Yoga-Yoga-for-the-Body-You-Have-Today/dp/B0013BK168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HeavyWeight Yoga: Yoga for the Body You Have Today</a>, which together have really helped me build stability and flexibility.",1346371200,6,2375,6.395638629283489

This dvd is for older people.  Aot of the beginner dvd's say beginners but that's only if you are many many yrs younger.  I'm down to 125 lbs now.  I gone done to size 6 pants.  I was an 12.

I do at least one section of this DVD right after I get up and it makes a world of difference in the way I feel. I also like it, because I can do the standing, sitting, or the floor stretching. It only takes 10 minutes to do one section. A whole workout is 30 minutes. I don't like to exercise when I first get up, but this has made me feel so much better. It is for beginners, so if you are a professional stretcher, this may not be the one for you. But, for the rest of us, it is great!!!",1341187200,,574,3.823529411764706

For those who want a good stretch work out , don't be fooled into thinking this is too easy, there are challenging poses and the instructions are fairly easy to follow.
be well!",1339459200,,358,4.264705882352941
1629805,5,B00005N8AN,"I love Jillian Michaels, but my only complaint would have to be, not enough stretching at the end of her workouts. Plus the stretches are always accompanied by pretty energetic music. Not what I am looking for at the end of a tough workout. Additionally, I work a high-stress, physically demanding job (catering) and at the end of the day I am often in pain. So I started looking for a stretching video that was relaxing and would work well for both post workout cool down, and post work stress reduction. Tamilee's Total Body Stretch for Beginners is exactly what I needed! I am fairly flexible, and would not consider myself a beginner to stretching. I've taken ballet, gymnastics and Tae-Kwon-Do throughout my life, all of which teach and encourage extensive stretching, so the technique is nothing new to me. What I wanted from a video was a guided stretch, so that I didn't have to count how long I was in each position and instead could focus on breathing and relaxing. This is the perfect video! The music is calming, the ocean view behind Tammilee is gorgeous, her voice is gentle. Additionally, if you are new to stretching, her explanation of technique is quite good. I am looking forward to incorporating both the relaxation and flexibility routines into my workouts regularly.",1339200000,4,1288,4.806306306306307
1629806,5,B00005N8AN,Tammilee Webb is a renown and highly respected trainer teacher.  This is great for me after treadmill workout.  Just what I was looking for.,1337817600,,140,4.791666666666667
1629837,5,B00005N8AN,"As an aging runner and bicyclist (been doing both for about 20 years) I am in constant need of good stretches. I've tried everything--from yoga classes to DVDs (I have them in an excel spreadsheet to rate and keep track) and I have to say, this DVD is the BEST one for stretching that I own.

There are two workouts broken down into smaller increments, so no matter what your schedule or fitness level, you can fit stretching into your day and exercise routine.

I don't rate things on amazon unless I'm really upset or thrilled with a product, and this DVD so thrilled me I am writing this 5-star review. If you want to stretch from head to foot and not injure yourself, this is a great one.",1335484800,,692,4.3565891472868215
1629838,5,B00005N8AN,The DVD is a great DVD for a simple stretch. Great for arthritis and stiffness. Once I finished the DVD I felt so much better. Great for starting out and staying limber.,1334880000,,169,4.3125
1629839,5,B00005N8AN,"I've been doing this DVD for a few weeks now and can really tell a difference in the stiffness from which I was suffering.  This DVD is very versatile in that she has a 30 minute flexibility stretch as well as three separate 10 minutes stretches: one done while sitting, one standing and one on the floor.  So you can mix and match whatever variations you like according to your time availability or preferred stretching program.  I try to do at least one 10 minute stretch several days a week and a 30 minute stretch a couple times a week and it has really helped.  I'm sleeping better, too, as I was experiencing aches and pains in my hip but that has subsided quite a bit and I'm more relaxed and flexible in general.  I've heard stretching is so good for your body as you get older (well, at any age!) and I highly recommend this program.  Ms. Webb is very relaxing, pleasant and gentle in her presentation and makes you feel comfortable at your level.",1332806400,,956,4.403409090909091
1629840,3,B00005N8AN,"This was decent, but not great. I did learn some new stretches. And I like how it's broken down into three segments. Doing the stretches standing, sitting, and on the floor made it more interesting.
But she holds each stretch for only five to eight seconds, and that's not long enough.",1330732800,4,285,4.607843137254902

1629842,5,B00005N8AN,"I ordered this DVD on Jan 1st as part of my New Year's resolution to get in better shape for 2012, including diet and exercise.  I have used The Firm
Video workouts for the past several years, but I noticed even with this added exercise, I was really getting stiff and sore.  Both my Chiropractor and Massage Therapist told me I needed to stretch more.  I was finding that my posture was
getting worse, and at my age (67), I felt I needed something.  Tamilee's DVD was exactly what I needed.  I have been doing the standing and sitting routines three times a week for five weeks now. The first time I did them, I couldn't believe how tight I was.  I had my first massage after I had done the first two routines three times, and I couldn't believe how much less pain the massage caused.  A month later, my therapist couldn't believe the difference in me.  She said that she didn't need to work as hard, I had only a slight discomfort on my right hip and nowhere else.  For the first time since undergoing deep tissue massage, I felt invigorated after a massage, instead of feeling all of my aches and pains.  I can't say enough about this video. I have enough flexibility now to include the floor routine, which I couldn't do at first. This is a great routine for older people.",1329523200,4,1276,4.36864406779661
1629843,2,B00005N8AN,I enjoy the exercises that this DVD offers and have enjoyed other fitness videos and instruction by Tamilee Webb.  However this particular DVD is defective. I returned the first copy I received because the DVD completely cuts out the floor exercises.  I received the new DVD and it does the same thing--it goes from the end of the seated stretches and skips to the cool down of the floor exercises.  The actual floor exercises are missing.  I was disappointed as the floor exercises were the main ones I wanted.  I won't return the second copy since It still has the 30 minute flexibility workout on the DVD.  But just be warned if you decide to buy it.,1327968000,2,653,4.538461538461538
1629844,5,B00005N8AN,"I have never done a review, but I had to for this DVD.  I am older and just getting back into exercise and found this DVD to be excellent for the unstretched, stiff beginner.  It does not contain endless fast, jerky repetition and moves smoothly into each position with great directions.  It has 3 total body sessions, 10 minutes long for each.  I felt so good that I did all 3 sessions the first time!  Money well spent!",1327276800,2,421,4.346153846153846
1629845,5,B00005N8AN,"I'm a 28 year old female, and I LOVE this DVD.  I use it all the time - after exercising, or just to refresh myself when I get home from work, or to relax before bed.  It's easy to follow and really suitable for any level of flexibility.  I can't say enough wonderful things about it.",1325894400,,284,4.035714285714286
1629846,5,B00005N8AN,"This really is JUST stretch. There's no muscle endurance work or strengthening. I consider this to be a positive. I'm using other workouts to get those things so what I wanted is what I got - stretching.

I like the fact that there are three ten-minute stretch routines or one thirty minute routine (you can also do the three ten minute routines together). This allows me to use whatever section I have time for and feel like I need.

There were two exercises I had trouble with because of balance. That said, balance is something I need to work on so I don't mind.

I enjoy the workouts and Tamilee.

AM/PM stretch is an alternative and it's also good. That said, she includes quite a few muscle endurance exercises in her routines. On top of that, I cannot stand the PM stretch section. It would be ok but I really don't need instruction on giving myself a foot massage. I need stretching exercises and the whole ""mini foot massage"" thing is a total waste of time that really gets on my nerves. That said, I really enjoyed the AM stretch even though my thigh muscles were a bit sore afterward. :)",1323043200,3,1098,4.447761194029851
1629865,5,B00005N8AN,"I love this DVD; in fact I've bought it three times now!  The first time it got scratched (quite by accident), the second time my DVD player ate it...(really!) and the third time was the charm.  I've managed to keep it safe.

There are so many great things about this DVD.  I like the fact that I can do one 10 minute segment, a combination of any two segments or I can do all three.  I always feel taller, and ""loosend up"" after I do this stretch.  Added bonus - Tamilee is not one of those annoying instructers with bad music.

Whether your a newby to stretching or a yogi I think you'll find this DVD is quite enjoyable.",1315440000,,623,4.184873949579832
1629866,5,B00005N8AN,"I love Tamilee!  she is very clear and precise, she explains everything she is telling you to do, and she has such a mellow, friendly way about her.  These stretching routines really do the trick!",1310688000,,196,4.571428571428571
1629867,4,B00005N8AN,"To give you reference: I'm by no means a fitness expert. I've done really light yoga before but not on a steady basis. I found this DVD to be perfect for me. You definitely feel the stretches without it being overbearing.

I love the way that the DVD is categorized by ""Standing"", ""Sitting"", and ""On the Floor"" because I don't always feel like getting covered in carpet fuzz (or moving my coffee table). For those situations, I think the ""Standing"" segment is perfect. I don't really have a half hour every day to stretch so the way it's split up is great. If you do one 10 minute segment per day, I think you'll feel a difference in your aching joints.",1310601600,3,653,4.396694214876033

There are actually a few stretches I have never seen before. I don't think I will use the 10 min segments for stretch because I don't think they were as helpful as the section on Stretching for Flexibility which is 30 min.  This DVD is for all levels of stretching and Tamilee explains the different variations as you go.  It is especially great for people who need extra stretching before and/or after athletic activities.",1295654400,6,566,4.696969696969697

1629873,5,B00005N8AN,"I've used other exercise programs by Ms Tamilee Webb, so I was confident I would not be disappointed in her Total Stretch DVD. She's a great exercise leader and here is why: clear instructions; she goes slowly enough for you to follow, but not so slow that you get bored; includes adaptations for all fitness/flexibility levels. Also, her attitude is so positive and kind. This DVD is a comprehensive stretching routine for your entire body: challenging, yet achievable. I'm glad I bought it.",1294531200,2,492,4.9397590361445785

In the past few years I have limited my exercise because of arthritis in my hip and knee and feel that I am becoming stiff, which I do not like.  ""Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee"" shows stretching exercises for the whole body.  The instructor's voice is soft and smooth (not chatty), and her explanations are easy to follow.  I love this DVD and already feel better after using these techniques for only a few days.  I highly recommend it.",1293926400,6,502,4.413043478260869
1629884,5,B00005N8AN,"After a ribcage injury that kept me from exercising for two months, I was unsure how to proceed once I was relatively healed. I bought this dvd based on user reviews and am very happy I did. The routines are thorough and safe, easy to follow, and Ms. Webb's delivery is sane and helpful. Because there are three segments, I was able to start small and build up until I could do all three straight through. I recommend this video for people starting out or starting over in a fitness regimen, but it's also great as an energizer in the morning or a relaxant after a long day. It's a classic stretch workout that I'll be using for years.",1292716800,2,635,4.34453781512605

1629886,5,B00005N8AN,"This DVD says it's for beginners and it is. There may be a couple more advanced moves but basically, it's a beginners stretch.  It works. The scenery is beautiful and the camera work great. The music is relaxing.  I use this routine often. Sometimes just parts of it. She only makes a couple of verbal stumbles, nothing major. I can't overemphasize the gorgeous scenery and bird life which lends itself to the goal of relaxing you.",1291766400,2,431,4.657894736842105
1629887,5,B00005N8AN,"I love the Beginner's stretch portion of this video.  It is broken into 10 minute increments - great if you are short on time.  There is a sitting, standing, and lying program, each 10 minutes.  You can do 1, 2 or all 3.  It really relaxes as well as energizes.  Simple to do.  Highly recommend for everyone.",1289779200,,308,4.315789473684211
1629888,5,B00005N8AN,"I purchased this DVD in May and have been using it faithfully for the past seven months. Let me just say that Tamilee is awesome! She is very encouraging, and does not have that typically annoying voice that most instructors have. She reminds you to do simple things that you may tend to forget such as proper breathing and posture. The DVD is composed of three 10 minute stretch routines: Standing, sitting, and a floor routine. And there is a 20-30 minute routine that focuses on all three areas along with a cool-down. I have acute cerebral palsy, so I was extremely inflexible with poor balance and range of motion as well as poor posture. Because of this video I am now much more flexible, my posture has improved as well as my balance. I can now do things I never thought I could before such as Tai Chi and kung fu. If this video can improve cerebral palsy, it can work for the most inflexible persons.",1287964800,4,908,4.4431137724550895
1629889,5,B00005N8AN,"I was looking for a DVD that was just stretching for my Mom who has Fibromyalgia and this DVD is perfect. Tamilee isn't annoying at all, the scenery is beautiful, the music is peaceful and the stretches are effective. She explains everything well so you stretch correctly and reminds you of all the normal things like not holding your breath, shoulders not being up to your ears and so on. Theres three 10 minute total body stretches standing, sitting and floor which I love for when your short on time or before and after a different workout that doesn't include stretching and one 30 minute stretch for flexibility which is my favorite. This DVD is definitely worth owning in ones library of exercise DVDs.",1287619200,3,708,4.717741935483871
1629890,5,B00005N8AN,"Wow--this was an excellent stretch!

The stretches themselves were incredibly invigorating--they awakened my muscles so completely that I couldn't wait to hop onto the treadmill and enjoy a softer, easier run as a result of my super relaxed muscles.

The scenery (seafront), calming music, and lack of the usual annoying trappings in other workout DVD's (you know--large groups of people standing in a studio under fluorescent lights--those are so uninspiring!) make this a soothing, super-relaxing workout, too, that I often enjoy before bedtime (and it has really helped me get rid of my insomnia!)

My only complaint: that there isn't an intermediate or advanced level to move on to. I would LOVE to buy more of these after I've exhausted this thing! Luckily, there are three different routines on the DVD.",1287446400,2,809,5.1603053435114505
1629891,5,B00005N8AN,"I'm a 70 year ""young"" female and a former couch potato so I am inflexible. These stretches are excellent and not difficult to do.  I was pleasantly surprised at the stretch I felt in my hips and hamstrings in positions I was easily able to do.

I recently started doing Lee Holden's Qigong for Seniors which is great.  It has a modified version that is done in a chair,  but doesn't address my tight hips and hamstrings.  I also bought Karen Holden's 2 stretching DVD's; however they are not modified,  and I could not do them.  Unfortunately they are 30 minutes long each and do not have segments, so you cannot skip anything. Don't waste your money there.

I read all the reviews of all the stretching DVD's on Amazon and selected Total Stretch for beginners because it has 3 choices of a total body stretch which are only 10 minutes long each.

Following my Qigong DVD, I am doing the sitting version which is for anyone who doesn't want to get down on the floor, but might not have enough balance to do the standing stretch and it works great for me.  I was able to do all the stretches and felt that Tamilee went through them at a reasonable pace with excellent directions.  I was able to follow and keep up with her and I was thoroughly stretched in 10 minutes. My hips and hamstrings were well stretched which felt good.

I did the Beginners Stretch for Flexibility one evening when I had more time and was able to do all the stretches by using a chair for support and balance on some of the standing stretches.
I was impressed.  I felt very stretched and relaxed.
I highly recommend this DVD.  I am so please that I found it.",1283904000,,1633,4.382059800664452
1629892,5,B00005N8AN,"Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee is one hour and one minute and was released on DVD on December 4, 2001. This DVD can be done all at once or one segment at a time depending on the shape you are in. The DVD is divided into two main segments. The first one is Total Body Stretch for Beginners and that is broken down into three different parts; see below. Tamilee does not name poses like mountain pose or warrior pose, but instead names body parts that let the viewer knows what part of the body she is concentrating on at that time.

Standing Stretch-13 minutes
Overhead stretch, chest stretches, rotary cuff stretch, lower body, & inner thighs

Sitting Stretch-9 minutes (chair needed)
Chest stretch, triceps stretch, and hamstring stretch

Floor Stretch-11 minutes
Back stretch, Inner thighs, hip stretches, front thigh stretches, chest stretch, and neck stretch

Segment two is called Beginners Stretch for Flexibility which is twenty-eight minutes long and is one continuous stretch and pretty much follows the same pattern above, but does not include a sitting stretch and the moves are different. There is some humor in this section. There is a tropical bird in the background that Tamilee is unaware of. The only downside to this DVD is her sense of direction. When Tamilee tells the viewers to go left she goes right and just the opposite. Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee is a great DVD for newcomers to stretching and gets an AAAAA+++++.

1629893,5,B00005N8AN,Tammy is an excellent instructor and the stretches are great. I can do them all even though I have a cervical fusion and need a lower back fusion. In fact since doing the stretches the pain in my lower back has improved 100% and I no longer have muscle spasms like I use too.,1283472000,,275,4.111111111111111
1629904,4,B00005N8AN,Very good DVD for beginners and perfectly separated for people short on time.  I tend to do only one of the options for 10 min stretch at a time.,1278979200,,145,4.0
1629905,4,B00005N8AN,"I like this video overall. I've used it several times and I always feel pretty good when I'm done.  She stretches all parts of the body and you can choose a 30 minute routine or from three different 10 minute routines.  After I lift weights, which I do at home, I usually go to this video afterwards to ensure a full body stretch... which I probably wasn't doing enough of until now.  And Tami isn't annoying to me so that of course is a bonus!

Overall, if you're looking for a good video to stretch with....this is it!",1277337600,,520,4.275510204081633
1629906,4,B00005N8AN,"A very good DVD.....I've never spent any time stretching, because other routines were too advanced.  This DVD is very good for beginners and beyond.",1274140800,,148,5.166666666666667
1629907,2,B00005N8AN,I think I must have purchased a bad copy. The DVD kept skipping to the end of the DVD. It was a great workout when it wasn't skipping. I am going to have to return it for another one,1271289600,4,182,3.6923076923076925
1629908,5,B00005N8AN,This was a good buy. Tamilee instructs on how to stretch your body. There are 3 ten minute intervals so if you are pressed for time doing just the 10 minutes is a great option. If you do all 3 wow it feels so good. Great tool for relaxation.,1269216000,,241,3.938775510204082
1629909,5,B00005N8AN,"Some of the other stretch programs I've tried were too difficult for my mom, who has arthritis and has not exercised in a long time.  This one was just the right combo of easy and challenging.  I highly recommend it.",1265846400,,216,4.375
1629910,3,B00005N8AN,"Tamilee hits most of the major muscles with the options available, however, in my opinion the actual stretches should be held much longer.  The DVD is broken up into 4 segments. You have your choice of a standing routine, a chair routine, and a floor routine (all are around 10 minutes each), or you can do the 20 minute standing/floor blend routine. The 3 ten minute routines are against an ocean backdrop, the blend routine is ""foresty"".  All are tranquil with decent soft music that does not interfere. There is a nice cool down mental relaxation at the end of the blend routine. This is a nice routine where ""most"" of the movements are for beginner's, however there are a couple of more difficult positions in the floor portions of the video. As stated, I would like the video more if she held each stretch for a longer period of time. I find myself just holding through certain stetches when she says ""ok, release, now do it again"" - I never release until she goes to the next movement. Overall, I am NOT unhappy with this purchase, though I'm still in the market for a good stretch video.",1264896000,10,1094,4.52020202020202
1629911,5,B00005N8AN,"I've recently joined a local gym, but knew I needed to warm up before going there.  This Total Stretch for Beginners is perfect for me.
I'm very inflexible so I can begin gently.  It's shot on location in Jamaica with very soothing music.  Tamilee is wonderful in her
explanations and makes you want to get in shape.  You can do the standing stretch routine (10 min.), the sitting stretch routine (10) and
the floor stretch routine (10).  I've been doing all three and can already tell a difference in my flexibility.  I'm so glad I found this
video and Tamilee!",1263168000,,562,4.57
1629912,4,B00005N8AN,"This is a solid, two-part stretch video, and the first part can be done as a full half-hour or broken down into standing, sitting, and floor work.  It is not as comprehensive a body stretch as I might have hoped, but that may be more a function of time than the stretches she chooses.  It was a good purchase and I will probably use it quite a few times.",1262736000,,354,4.115942028985507
1629913,5,B00005N8AN,I really enjoy this stretch video.  It does exactly what it says it will do.  I am excited to try it more often.  I love the stretch and relaxation part. Its great to help me unwind at the end of a long day.,1260835200,,207,3.7674418604651163
1629914,5,B00005N8AN,"I've recently began taking stretching seriously and have bought a few stretching DVDs. This one has been the best so far. Tamilee doesn't have you do complicated moves with your body. Instead, you are stretching in ways that feel natural and easy. It feels so relaxing to do these moves rather than feeling challenging. You can just get lost in the feeling of letting go of stress rather than worrying about doing the moves right.

Maybe, at some point, a more advanced DVD would be needed, but if you just want to take care of your muscles without getting too wrapped up in technique, this DVD is perfect.",1257033600,5,606,4.611111111111111
1629915,5,B00005N8AN,"I like this dvd.  It's filled with pretty basic stretching, but as someone who has never been flexible nor stretched routinely, this was exactly what I needed.  The instructor is likable, and I thought her instructions were very easy to understand.  For example, if she wants you to tilt your hips forward, she'll take her hands and push her hips forward while she's describing the movement...she uses motions like that to help emphasize her positioning, which I found unexpectedly helpful.  She also tells you exactly where you should be feeling the stretch, so that you know if you're doing it correctly. If you are not a beginner, you will probably not like this dvd at all.

1629917,5,B00005N8AN,"I had an old back injury and due to my busy schedule my life got very sedentary. In order to work out again I had to strength my back first so I decided to buy this video to start all over again. What I mean by ""to start all over again"" is to get that flexibility I need before I initiate any kind of work out routine (to avoid hurting my back again) and this video has been very helpful. Please take note that this video is perfect for people like me who want to start from zero and ""slowly but surely."" It has different and simple routines anybody can follow of 10 minutes each session which helps you to avoid all kind of ""excuses"". I work full time as a secretary and my neck and back are killing me by the time I get home and I also go to school in the evenings so before I start working with my school papers or anything else, I do 10 minutes and during ""breaks"" I do other 10 minutes and other 10 before going to bed which is perfect (I even sleep better). I do not feel I need to schedule a specific time to do this, I just do it very simple.

After 3 years of inactivity - I tried a few other stretching dvd's before purchasing this one and they seemed to jump right into some rather deep stretching - which in turn just caused instant pain and muscle spasms. What I love about this dvd is that it starts with major muscles only - and as recommended by doctors - gentle stretching for beginners that prevents injury/re-injury while still giving my body what it needs to get on the right track to a healthier, more active self. I was able to start slowly - with 10 minutes 2x per day and still stretch my entire body, while 15 minutes into another dvd - I would only be half-stretched but unable to finish because the pain would kick in. I was able to move slowly up to 20 minutes, then on to 30 minutes at a time. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.",1247875200,,985,4.382513661202186

This DVD is really relaxing and helps you stretch so that you feel energized.

Although they say, consult your doctor first, most doctors don't know squat about yoga or stretching exercises to realign the spine.  On days that I might be inclined to skip the 5 minute workout, I remind myself that I would not skip my medications ( I am on several not related to my back) so why should I skip my stretching routine?
I believe these simple exercises got me back to playing tennis, riding a moutain bike and swimming. I am 65 years old, and would not do any of those things that I love, without doing these exercises first!!",1235606400,2,639,4.452991452991453
1629927,5,B00005N8AN,"This exercise DVD is destined to be my favorite when it comes to stretching.  There is nothing mystical presented here, though I've seen some of the stretches in yoga.  It is simply a comprehensive stretching of every major part of the body, in segments of sitting, standing, and lying down.  If that's not enough, she also provides a flowing segment for a beginner's flexibility stretch.  Tamilee has a very pleasing style and voice, and provides excellent directions.  She is in really good shape without being pencil-thin, so she and these exercises are not intimidating.  The camera coverage is some of the best that I have ever seen in an exercise DVD, the background is very pretty without being distracting, and the sound quality is excellent.  Even the background music is easy on the ears and unobtrusive.  This was a pleasant viewing (and using) experience from beginning to end.  It is the first Tamilee Webb video I have ever purchased, and I am very glad that I did.",1233446400,3,979,4.81437125748503

I have never before exercised, or officially stretched, so needless to say I started out at ground zero.  Tammy Lee Webb is non-abrasive, very encouraging and calming, without being cheesy or phoney.  I was excited and very encouraged that I gained much more flexibility and accomplished more than I could when I began after only the second and third viewing/exercises.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE WHO DESIRES MORE FLEXIBILITY AND/OR WISHES TO RELAX BOTH MIND AND BODY AFTER A LONG DAY, BE IT WORK OR SPORTS.  I also found that I sleep better and wake up more rested after using the dvd at the end of the day.",1226361600,7,720,4.637795275590551
1629932,5,B00005N8AN,"I'll sum up to say I had a terrible accident and became very inflexible based on my own fears.  I needed to get back in the game so to speak.  But I've never been a fan of stretching.  It actually is really important.  It helps to prevent injuries, it helps with balance and stress relief, and it helps you to be able to tie your shoes before you go for your run at 85 years of age.  Stretching is good for your body, I know that now, and I won't ever stop doing it now.

This video is great, you can pick a 10 minute stretch of floor, chair or standing exercises.  You can do all three together, you can do two at a time. That part is up to you.  But then there is a stretching segment for flexibilty and that part is a 30 minute program of moving from one stretch right into the next, a very cohesive program for those that like that.

When I started I did one 10 minute session a day, the floor one, then I moved to sitting, then standing, then two at a time, then all three and then the flexibility program, I have gotten more flexible and recently had to replace my worn out copy, I still do at least 10 minutes a day, in addition to moving into beginner yoga and my cardio.

I like that the instructor talks about feeling your stretch, not twisting yourself into pain.",1224806400,4,1274,4.100806451612903

1629938,5,B00005N8AN,"In 1996 I suffered a disabling back injury as a nurse.  I used to workout everyday, but after 8 surgeries I was in chronic pain and just barely able to get around inspite of lots of pain meds.  I found that my limited mobility caused me to get very stiff and was causing my pain to increase.  I tried numerous exercise and stretching videos but they were too difficult for me to use.

This is the best streching video I have ever used.  It offers 3 basic routines (1 standing, 1 sitting, 1 lying down) that only take about 10 min. each.  It is perfect for me because if I have trouble doing a stretch standing I can do it sitting down.  I've found I use elements from all 3 routines to do a total body stretch without pain.  And after using the video for a week the pain in my hips, which had been keeping me awake for over a year, is gone!

I would recommend this tape to everyone and encourage you to use it at least 3 times a week if not daily (when I get lazy and don't use it, my pain comes right back!).  This tape is also great for anyone who spends their day hunched over a computer because you can do the sitting routine in 10 minutes right in your cubicle and nobody will even know.

Pain relief for under $10!  I would have never thought it was possible!  As an added bonus, there is a stretching routine on the disc too which both me and my puppy found to be very relaxing.",1209081600,7,1385,4.0851851851851855

I was expecting something very simple, not too complicated, and I was sorely disappointed...pun intended.  She stretched me in ways that a human is not meant to be stretched...unless of course you are a size 0 and can bend yourself into a human pretzel.  I am by no stretch of the imagination a size 0, so I found the stretches to be difficult and extremely awkward.  I also bought this DVD because in the description it said that it had a relaxation technique session.  Well the session lasted for about 5 minutes, and it was not differentiated on the DVD menu from the stretching exercises.  I had to jump around on the DVD for about 15 minutes before I finally found it.  I would not recommend this product for someone who is looking for a ""beginners"" stretching video.

We can actually do and enjoy the standing routine!  We hope to add the others after awhile, but right now the standing stretches just feel so good that we're only doing that, plus it takes very little floor space which is helpful.  Tammilee is very clear in her directions.  She doesn't push to do more than is comfortable, and has a pleasent voice.  I know that seems trivial but one exercise tape I got I couldn't even use because of the instructor's voice!  Maybe It's just me.

There are no moves on the video that I can't perform... okay maybe not as graceful as the woman in the video (Tamilee) but I can do the stretches and it feels good.  There are three ten minute sets.  You can do them all or just one set at a time.  There is a standing set, a sitting set, and a floor set.  I bought the video so I could get a quick ten minute stretch in the morning before I go to work; unfortunately, I am not an early bird so my workouts are in the evening and I have found they are quite relaxing.  The DVD is older (from 2001) but the quality is good and the routine is great for training beginners, seniors, and people who are just completely out of shape.  In other words just about anybody can stretch with this DVD.",1189641600,15,902,4.0852272727272725

And it helps that Tamilee is so likable and (how a dvd can give you this impression I don't know) not judgmental.

I use this on days I am not doing any other regular exercise because I really feel that any movement seems to help. I have just found out that getting healthy can be a bunch of baby steps and still have results, instead of being overwhelmed with structure you can improve just doing little things here and there.",1189382400,3,599,4.163793103448276
1629949,5,B00005N8AN,"This is a really good stretch workout.  Tamilee has a personable, matter-of-fact demeanor which occasionally gets conversational, but is never condescending.  I love the setting on a beach, and the wicker mat she's on blends in with the sand in a really nice way.  The music is nice and not too loud.

There are three sections: standing, sitting, and floor.  I found the floor workout a bit difficult for me because it involved a lot of kneeling on the knees, and for someone like me who is considerably overweight, it might be too difficult.  The standing and sitting stretches are really great.  The second segment is a beginning stretch for flexibility, which is relaxing and effective.  It's a bit more intensive than some stretch workouts, and took me several viewings before I could manage to do most stretches.  Definitely watch this at least once before trying!

What I enjoy about this video is that you can use a single 10 minute stretch on its own, or in combination with another workout.  Or, you can combine almost any of the 10 minute segments with or without the 30 minute segment for a longer workout.  It's very handy.

This is one of my two favorite stretch DVDs, the other being Michelle LeMay's Rejuvenating Core Stretch.",1187222400,8,1241,4.769953051643192
1629950,5,B00005N8AN,"I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking for a good, solid stretching routine.  I've had this DVD for quite a while and still use it on a regular basis, even though I'm beyond the beginner level.  The moves are basic, but thorough.  Every part of the body gets stretched.  There also are no pilates or yoga-inspired moves, which is just fine by me.  Sometimes Tamilee's banter gets weird--she mentions stretches you should do if you're a sumo wrestler!  I don't think that applies to many of the viewers.  But happily, there is a ""music only"" soundtrack so once you're familiar with the routine, you can turn off the narration if you choose.  But otherwise, she's a competent, likeable instructor--not annoyingly perky but not comatose, either.  She gives clear instructions and points out where you should feel the stretch.

The first part of the DVD is divided into 3 10-minute routines: standing, seated, and on the floor.  I usually use the standing stretch section after working out, and add in the floor stretch if I want a little more.  As a matter of personal preference, I don't care for the seated stretching section.  But if standing/balancing for long periods or getting to the floor is difficult, the seated stretches are just the thing for you.

The second part is a 30-minute routine which is pleasant and relaxing.",1181692800,13,1342,4.828947368421052

It truly is for beginners, like me, but it stretches every muscle group in your body.  I would recommend, for a thorough stretch, doing all three sections (standing, sitting and floor) unless you are really short of time as I found that doing only one 10-minute section is not enough.

Tamilee is excellent.  She clearly explains how to do each stretch, why you are stretching each area, where you should feel the stretch and she truly seems to understand that there are actually people like me that cannot touch their toes.  (I bought a few other stretching DVDs, AM & PM Stretch being one of them, and I can do less than 1/4 of it as you need very flexible hamstrings for that DVD)

So if you want a very good stretch and do not want to be disappointed or frustrated by stretches you cannot perfom, buy this DVD first.",1165968000,37,981,4.477528089887641

Tamilee tells you where you should feel the stretch, reminds you to breathe, and corrects errors you might make in position. . . there is not a lot of small talk that gets old after a few plays, and Tamilee is not a super model. She is a beautiful normal-size woman, and looks like she is proud of it! She is in great shape, but not a size 4 by any means.",1165968000,4,428,4.047058823529412
1629960,4,B00005N8AN,"Due to limited space in my room, I cannot efficiently execute floor stretches, as my legs & arms do not have enough room to move, and I'm constantly restricting my movement or smacking things around. The standing & chair stretches are a blessing, as I can complete both routines without having to worry about fast forwarding through floor stretches as I do with other DVD's. The routines Tamilee created are very effective, hitting most of the major muscle groups that we use during daily activity, and ones that have particularly been giving me trouble.

My only problem is that she does not hold the stretches long enough. I'd say she averages about 5-8 seconds per side on each stretch, whereas I was seeking about 15-30 seconds per side. Because of this, I'm in the process of memorizing the routines, so that I may do them without the video, and hold the positions for longer intervals.

Other than the short stretch intervals, the DVD is great. The option of having standing, sitting, and floor stretches as three separate entities is a fantastic idea, and the instructor is easy going and pleasant to follow. Definitely recommended!",1163376000,17,1139,4.865979381443299
1629961,5,B00005N8AN,"I'm a male in my mid-thirties. I am and always have been inflexible. I recently had back surgery and I realized that I could do one of two things: decide to never again take any physical risks in life and accept that I will continue to lose flexibility at an alarming rate due to lack of movement/activity. Option two was to take a serious look at how I could regain some of my range of motion and possibly even extend it. I chose the latter.

I've amassed a wide variety of yoga and stretching DVDs over the last year. The two I bought first were Tamilee's Total Stretch for Beginners and AM/PM Stretch for Health with Madelaine Lewis. These two remain favorites of mine.

Both are more geared toward the average person; no intimidating, foot-behind-the-head yoga poses here. These are basic stretches that should be safe for all, when coupled with common sense.

Although I like both DVDs mentioned above, Tammilee's DVD gives more bang for the buck. There are multiple options here, depending on how much time you have, There are three different 10-minute, total body workouts - one standing, one sitting and one on the floor. All the workouts are perfect for when you lack either the time or ambition to commit thirty-minutes or more to stretching. There is also a thirty-minute workout that gives you a more thorough stretch when that's what you're looking for.

This DVD gives you a little bit of everything. I'd recommend both this and AM/PM if you plan to purchase two DVDs, but Total Stretch is my recommendation if you only buy one. It gives you all the options you could need and is the best stretch DVD I've ever had.",1163116800,314,1629,4.626297577854671
1629962,5,B00005N8AN,"I had resigned myself to being the ""stiffest"" person I know after trying several beginner yoga dvd's and asking various yoga instructors to HELP ME with my inflexibility. For 35 years, I've never felt that a yoga instructor truly understood what it's like to not be able to touch your toes, much less sit up straight with your legs sticking out in front of you.

Tamilee Webb DOES understand, and the workouts on this dvd are so doable and so enjoyable that I say thank you to her image on my tv screen every evening after the stretches.

I know that stretching is very important for your health (especially as you age), and this dvd feels so good that I no longer dread the thought of stretching but actually look forward to my 30 mins workout at the end of the day.

I give this dvd a wholehearted 5 stars for Tamilee and her wonderful instruction, however, the editor needs a clap on the head. In several of the moves, she does more stretching on one side than on the other. This should have been noticed and rectified. As it is, I just press ""pause"" and repeat the stretch.

After just a week of this dvd, I already see a big difference in my flexibility and can't wait to see where I'll be in a few weeks time...",1162598400,6,1217,4.324561403508772
1629963,4,B00005N8AN,"Only negative so far is that I wish the stretches would each last a little longer.  Otherwise, it's thorough, not too difficult, and Tamilee is very informative, serene, and motivating.  Highly recommend!",1159315200,4,204,5.34375
1629964,5,B00005N8AN,"I love this dvd.  It has two stretch routines on it, and it's so nice to do either at the end of the day, or just after a workout.  You feel so relaxed after it.  It is set in Jamaica on a beach and that in itself is relaxing.

Throughout, there is standing, sitting and lying down stretches.  There is hardly (if any) muscle in your body that won't get stretched.  It has nice soothing music to workout to and I think anyone would love this.  It really will help loosen and lengthen your muscles and you don't have to have a high level of fitness to enjoy it or benefit from it.  This is a great workout for sure.",1154390400,7,614,4.058333333333334
1629965,4,B00005N8AN,"This video is fine if you are not very flexible.  I have lost flexibility over the years and thought this would be a good video for me.  However, it just didn't provide much stretch where I wanted it.  Tamilee looks very strong (amazing arms), but she is not very flexible.  If you are a bobybuilder, this is the video for you.  If you are a dancer, skip it.",1149206400,13,358,4.205882352941177
1629966,5,B00005N8AN,"I like these workouts.  I did all three ten minute stretch workouts and the 30 minute flexibility workout today and was able to complete all of the segments and each of the moves the first time through.  I can't go as deep into some of the stretches as Tamilee does, but I definitely can get into the positions (a great start for me) and with time (hopefully), my muscles will loosen up.  This is a big boost to my morale - to feel like I can stretch.  I have tried some beginner yoga workouts with poses that maybe a contortionist could do, but which were entirely impossible for me, and which left me feeling awkward and uptight, not relaxed.  The background setting for these workouts is very pretty and the music is nice as well.  This is a keeper for me!",1144454400,13,759,4.347517730496454
1629967,4,B00005N8AN,"This is a basic stretch, but thorough.  Her guidance is great, and the combo of the workouts is nice.  I swim, and the chest stretches are great--I feel better after just doing the stretches once!

I wish it had more advanced versions of the stretches, but I have room for improvement with the stretches as presented.  A great starter stretch workout.",1143849600,11,351,4.704918032786885
1629968,5,B00005N8AN,"I can only reach my knees when trying to touch my toes and I can manage to do everything on this DVD.  It feels good and she makes it easy and it's relaxing.  I hate the ones when the instructor winds herself up like a circus act and then says ""if you can't do this yet just go as far as you can...""  Tamilee is not intimidating at all. I can't reach as far as her, but at least she looks realistic and gives me a goal I might reach someday. There are a few options to choose from too including stretching in a chair, on the floor or standing. I got 3 DVDs at the same time and I liked this one best.  When I get a little closer to my toes I'm going to get the next DVD with Tamilee.",1141689600,13,683,3.788732394366197
1629969,4,B00005N8AN,"I am 60 years old and never engaged in any formal streching program, but I thought I would give this a try.  It has been a terrific program making me feel wonderful when I am done and full of energy to face the day.  The 10 minute segments allow me to do a whole routine or just part of the routine while still getting benefit.  If you have never tried a streching program, this is a great way to get started for a very reasonable price.",1141257600,19,437,4.058139534883721
1629970,5,B00005N8AN,"I like that I can have a 30 minute flexibility workout or one of three 10 minute individual stretching workouts (Standing, Sitting, or Floor). Yoga is too slow for me so the pace of these workouts are great.",1138579200,4,207,4.473684210526316
1629971,4,B00005N8AN,"This stretch DVD by Tamilee Webb is very beautiful---the production is outstanding and the scenery (Jamaican beach) is gorgeous. This was a pleasant start for me as the stretches began. The stretches are athletic and some are different than the usual stretches seen on most other DVDs. Tamilee is soft spoken and has such a calm, soothing voice (complements the stretches nicely). I love how there are 2 different stretch workouts on 1 DVD: the first of the two is a 30-minute continuous stretch session. The second of the two has 3 10-minute stretches that include standing, sitting (using a chair) and floor stretches. I find these sections to be so great for days when time is more limited for stretching. These stretches relax me and the only thing I wish, is for the stretches to be held a little longer a than they are.",1125014400,11,825,4.696551724137931
1629972,3,B00005N8AN,"The reason this DVD got 3 stars is because the standing stretches were really great.  I especially like the first stretch in the standing routine and the stretch for the back of the thighs, since mine get really tight and sore without stretching.  I have not used the chair routine and the first time I tried the floor routine I stopped 30 seconds into the routine.  The beginning of the floor rountine had me sitting in a position that was very uncomfortable and I did not think the stretches were doing anything for me, so I stick with the standing rountine and use it after a brief warmup before I start my weight and aerobic workouts.  Tamilee Webb is a very encouraging instructor without being annoyingly perky like other instructors.  Another reason for the 3 stars is that Tamilee does not hold the stretches that long, about 10-15 seconds, if that.  What I do is slow do the DVD so that it is going in slow motion or put it on pause and hold the stretch as long as I feel I need to in order to get the full benefit of each stretch.",1123632000,23,1040,4.335051546391752
1629973,4,B00005N8AN,guess what! im not flexible AT ALL but i was able to do the whole stretch for flexibility part of this dvd! and i didn't get bored either! soo amazing...im going to keep doing it (only done it like 3 times so far) to see if it actually helps to me get more flexible. but try it out if you usually have problems stretching and need something for after your workouts.,1120780800,5,365,4.154929577464789
7946448,4,B00005N8AN,"This DVD is one of my favorite ""go-tos"" for stretching after a workout. The stretches are no-nonsense and functional,  and the instructor gives excellent cueing for proper form and technique, so even absolute beginners will be able to stretch safely (although more advanced exercisers will benefit too!). The first section consists of three separate routines: one with a chair, one standing and one sitting. You can mix and match or do all three. The second section is a full body stretch routine that begins standing and progresses to the floor, ending with a guided relaxation. I appreciate that the instructor is careful to stretch opposing muscle groups and takes equal time to stretch on both sides of the body, which is important.

I deducted one star because the actual copy of the disc was very poor quality - not great picture or sound, and it stopped working after only about 10 uses, so I had to purchase a new one.",1525392000,,926,4.78125
