8216645,5,B000V6LSLS,"I am a great fan of the radio Suspense series and remember when the TV version was shown in the early 1960's. I ordered the first collection and when this one became available I ordered it. The quality is excellent and the programming is as good as I remembered. If you like the radio version of this show, I believe you'll want to add this set to your collection.",1362182400,,364,4.2898550724637685
8216646,4,B000V6LSLS,"INFINITY's three SUSPENSE collections are dubbed from antique kinescopes, a process in which a film camera is pointed at a TV monitor and synched so that it doesn't capture a raster flicker. The sound is particularly clear, undoubtedly because audio was directly patched from a mixing board. Video quality is a bit grainy and similar to other kinescopes in that the picture's edges are missing and the view favors one side of the screen. I notice a slight tilt to the right.

When the long-running SUSPENSE radio program made a jump to television in 1949, several crew members and show scripts also came along. Of greatest prominence are director Robert Stevens and organist Hank Sylvern. Stevens also directed several dozen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-Presents/dp/B000AL733G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>&nbsp;TV episodes. Sylvern was organist on a number of radio shows and the composer of themes for ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin,"" ""Strike It Rich"" and others, plus the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Corbett-Space-Cadet/dp/B0028ZI8E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</a>&nbsp;TV series. He was also an orchestra leader.

I like best the earliest ('49) episodes of SUSPENSE, for they illustrate how post-war TV was a ""learn as you go"" process. These programs with live AUTO-LITE commercials run over 29 minutes each. It's impressive to see actors under the pressure of a live broadcast hit their marks, get their lines right and emote without overdoing it. Because of Sylvern's ever-present organ, SUSPENSE on TV is much like radio with pictures.

Of the dozens of TV series DVD collections in my home library, the Lost TV Episodes of SUSPENSE are among my very favorites. They're not perfect by any means, but they are perfect examples of what television was like over 60 years ago. Highest recommendation for fans of historic ""live"" TV broadcasts.

8216647,5,B000V6LSLS,"This is the third and final set of SUSPENSE tv series. Based on the radio program of the same name with original network commercials of Auto-Lite, the sponsor. This series was dramatized ""live"" from theatrical stages so it's as early television broadcasting history as one can get. They are limited with sets and costumes but most of the productions, compared to other TV series during the live broadcasting era, but they are above average.

Highlights include ""The Black Prophet"" with Leslie Nielsen and Boris Karloff and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" with Bela Lugosi. As for transfer quality, it doesn't get any better from kinescopes so grab these and the other two volumes today.",1238716800,,680,5.017699115044247

The 260 black and white half-hour episodes of the anthology series ""Suspense"" were originally broadcast from 1949-54 on CBS. Baby Boomers may confuse the original with the 23 episodes from the networks 1964 attempt to revive the series, which was hosted by Sebastian Cabot and was rather mild in comparison with the original.

The concept (suspense and tension) and the title actually date back to radio days. The 1942 radio program was very popular and ran for 20 years.

The series was early live television; it was broadcast as it was being performed. This was a concept that seemed quite logical to me as a child, I recall touring our local radio station and being disappointed that only a small portion of the programming was actually produced at that location. The show was not taped or conventionally filmed. If they wanted to preserve a performance (or broadcast it later in another region of the country) they filmed the broadcast image as it played on a video monitor. So don't except great contrast and resolution (and the audio is even worse); just be happy that a viewable image still exists.

The show's emphasis is scripting and acting, not production design and effects. But the stories are surprisingly entertaining and the DVD's contain some early commercials; which are as interesting in their own way as the episodes themselves. The DVD's are somewhat misleadingly labeled ""Suspense: The Lost Episodes - Collection 1 and 2"", as for practical purposes all the episodes were lost (but not unknown) until these DVD releases.

The Collection #2 four disc set includes: ""Suspicion"" (1949), ""The Doors on the Thirteenth Floor"" (1949), ""Collector's Item"" (1949), ""Cask of Amontillado (1949), The Third One (1949), The Man Who Talked in His Sleep (1950), ""Murder at the Mardi Gras (1950), ""Dark Shadows"" (1950), ""The Tip"" (1950), ""Tough Cop"" (1951), ""Telephone Call"" (1951), ""The Three of Silence"", ""The Juiceman"" (1951), ""Murderers' Meeting"" (1951), ""Frisco Payoff"" (1951), ""The Far-Off House"" (1951), ""Betrayal in Vienna"" (1952), ""The Purloined Letter"" (1952), ""The Corsage"" (1952), ""House of Masks"" 1952), ""For the Love of Randi"" (1952), ""The Beach of Falesa"" (1952), ""All Hallow's Eve"" (1952), ""The Moving Target"" (1952), ""Monsieur Vidocq"" (1952), Mr. Matches (1953), ""Career"" (1953), ""The Quarry"" (1953), ""Black Prophet"" (1953), and ""Portrait of Constance"" (1953).

8216651,5,B000V6LSLS,"Have already looked at Set 2.  These have great writing and performances.  Please remember that these shows survive only as kinescopes--filmed off of a video monitor as the show was going out live.  Most of the original commercials are intact.  CBS was somehow involved in this release, as they seem to hold the copyright to the show (and their logo appears on the packaging).

As to the Bela Lugosi episode....he's really quite good in it.  Doesn't blow one line in the show--but the other actor does!!",1192752000,13,503,4.790697674418604
