875561,5,6304437226,"""Come and cut my heart out, come and cut my heart out!"" Mason Storm yelled to a burglar in a convenient store. Steven Seagal played the tough detective who was in his knees and told the ugly psycho to come get some! After the man lunged toward the genius, Storm tripped him and then put him in an ankle lock! Such lordage to the extreme! You don't mess with Steven Seagal. Storm videotaped a deal go down between the Los Angeles mayor and some informants. An assassination plot to take to the bank! Some crooked cops working for the mayor overheard Storm's findings and they tried to murder him. They took out his wife and his son barely escaped. The little boy jumped out of the window! Bravery! Then Storm went into a ten-year coma and woke up to find the ""Weird Science"" lady. Kelly LeBrock helped him escape and he trained to become the defined cop what he once was. From silly running, twirling sticks and lifting small amounts of weight, Storm became immortal again. Breaking bones and glass came naturally to him again and he made bad cops into good cops again. Death was retribution for the immortal and he was able to form a relationship with his son again! Emotional tears! Great mastery!",1023321600,2,1198,4.550925925925926
875562,2,6304437226,"Not-so-exciting revenge story starring the ego maniac Steven Seagal. I was upset after watching this one. Seagal's wife is killed and he's put in a coma after finding evidence to put away a local mayor. Almost 7 years pass and he awakes to the ""Weird Science"" chick. They beat up a ton of people at a ranch and he embarrasses the bad guy at the end. Typical action movie.",1020816000,2,371,4.391304347826087
875563,3,6304437226,"True,this Seagal flick is a bit more spaced-out and repetitive than most of his flicks and it has a tendancy to shy away from it's grounding as an action flick into thriller territory. But this is still a classic in his league. There are some fabulous fight sequences towards the end,Seagal has one of the coolest names in action movie history,Mason Storm,and I have to say this is the only real film of his which I can appreciate as a piece of entertainment. In other words,there's no moral to the story like there seems to be in every other one of his flicks (i.e. On Deadly Ground,Marked for Death,The Patriot,Nico et al),it's just a film,not a piece of social commentary. Jean Claude Van Damme could just as easily have been in the lead role here. A Seagal flick on its own.",998352000,2,778,4.524822695035461
875564,5,6304437226,This was definitely one of Steven Segal's finest films. Playing the role of a policeman Segal video tapes a crooked politician striking a deal with underworld elements. This causes hired killers to invade his home. This invasion causes the death of his wife and places our hero in a 7 year coma. His son is raised by a fellow policeman. Segal comes out of his coma and narrowily escapes being killed again. The pretty nurse takes him to an isolated retreat where he regains his health. The crooked politician has now become a U.S. Senator. Through the efforts of our hero the politician is brought down and our hero gains revenge. This is a must see video.,974592000,6,656,4.615384615384615
875565,3,6304437226,"Being a huge fan of action films, it's hard to critique them because this genre of movie making has one purpose...to give viewers an escape from  reality and a sense of enjoyment in seeing scumbags and criminals get what  they don't get in the real world: The sh-- kicked out of them. For this  reason, I rate films of this nature on production values and good action  and effects, not necessarily the script or character definition. Most of  Steven Seagal's films are better-than-average and this one rates near the  top because the action is top-notch and the choreography of the  hand-to-hand scenes is truly believable. His aikido skills are remarkable.  There's even a little pathos and some humor thrown in to give viewers a  little more than just bone-breaking fun. This is a good movie if you  remember not to take it too seriously and just have fun and watch the bad  guys get theirs in painful quantities.",966211200,24,915,4.727848101265823
875606,5,6304437226,"Hard to Kill was always one of my favorite 90s movies. Hard to Kill came out when I was
in middle school/junior high. I remember seeing Hard to Kill then at at the dollar theater when it came out. I watch this movie namely to remember better times and to remember my childhood.

I just recently watched Hard to Kill after finding out on Lifetime that Steven Segal and Kelly LeBrock's middle child, Arissa Segal, is becoming a model. You have to check out Lifetime's Growing Up as a Supermodel to see Kelly LeBrock talk about her days as being a model before coming out in Weird Science, as well as the divorce with Steven, Arissa's father.

875614,3,6304437226,This is my favorite Steven Seagal movie.  He plays a cop who is left for dead/  He spends seven years in a coma.  After being cared for a by a nurse he finally wakes up.  And then realizes there are still people trying to kill hm.  It is a good action movie.  Not up there with Die Hard and Lethal Weapon and some of those movies.  And for me it was always hard to root for Steven Seagal.  There was just always something about him. It seems like he never even got knocked down in his fights.  To me he had an ego.  After he became less of a box office draw.  It kind of seems he lightened up.  It was fun to watch him get killed in Machete.  Anyway.  This is a pretty good movie.  Just don't analyze it to deeply.,1493164800,,714,3.9295774647887325

875636,4,6304437226,"In 1983, on the night of the Academy Awards (Ben Kingsley won!), L.A. cop Mason Storm demonstrated that he was Hard to Kill. Lurking in the shadows, having gathered incriminating evidence on crooked assemblyman Vernon Trent (William Sadler), Mason wasn't careful enough. It wasn't his fault that his precinct was infested with dirty cops. Mason Storm is one of those asskickers so cocky about his fighting skills that he gets on his knees in the convenience store and taunts an armed robber to come at him and get some. Then again, mastery of aikido does intill extraordinary self-confidence.

Maybe too much self-confidence. Mason got his partner and his family killed and himself shot up to bits and presumed dead. Them dirty cops, that wasn't enough dirty deeds for 'em. They planted coke on his dresser, this getting him branded as a dirty cop. Now the world at large thinks he's dead. But they should've known - Mason Storm is Hard to Kill.

Seven years pass before he wakes up in the L.A. Coma Center, sporting a shaggy beard. I appreciate that Mason isn't suddenly become all limber and active. No, son, a sizable chunk of the movie details Mason's slow recovery from debilitating atrophy, not that that was the most pressing obstacle. No sooner does Mason wake up when a murderous goon is deployed to bump him off. There's an amusing scene in which an orderly is doing his job massaging life back into Mason's lax muscles, only, a still groggy Mason keeps feverishly trying to get the guy to get him to safety. ""Get me out of here. Thanks for the massage. You gotta stop and get me out of here."" Poor orderly should've listened, or ducked.

Mason's one immediate ally is his sexy British coma nurse Andy Stewart (Kelly LeBrock) who spirits him away to a secluded place she was housesitting. Just once, when I fall into a coma, I wish I'd snag a nurse as fine as her.

Hard to Kill was released in 1990, smack dab in what's considered to be the heyday of Steven Seagal's movie career. Guy peaked early. I would say his glory years span from 1988 when he debuted in Above the Law to, if you're generous, 1996 when he made The Glimmer Man. Others more critical will say he approached his zenith in 1992 with Under Siege.

If you're of the 1988-1992 persuasion, maybe you agree that Hard to Kill is the weakest of that lot. It's not as badass as Above the Law (1988), Marked for Death (1990), Out for Justice (1991), or Under Siege (1992). I did say I appreciated that the movie takes time to show Mason's rehab, except, frankly, the movie lingers too long on montages of our guy practicing kata and applying acupuncture and just sitting there, sweaty in meditation.

Still, it's an early Steve Seagal actioner which means it still retains that gritty, street-level flavor and the hoods and goons our main man slaps around had colorful personality. This was back in the day before Seagal got fat and his fighting became a sorry shadow of how slick and mean and nasty his moves used to be when he first exploded on the scene. And Seagal always had that death stare, didn't he, that makes his adversaries go poo in their knickers. Hard to Kill delivers several dope combat scenes, with Seagal looking indomitable, never mind that he's in a ponytail. I loved this movie when I saw it back in 1990. Having seen it a bunch since then, it doesn't quite hold up to that initial level of regard. Seagal's then wife, Kelly Lebrock, is still foxy, but I've noticed that their chemistry onscreen isn't what I remembered; the sizzle is at a low ebb. And our heavy William Sadler's catch phrase - ""You can take that to the bank."" - is cheesy. No, the saving grace to this movie are the fight scenes and Seagal's intimidating presence. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1490572800,,3745,4.590433482810164

875734,5,6304437226,"Okay, so Die Hard is arguably the best action movie ever filmed. But Hard to Kill is arguably the second best action movie ever filmed. Steven Seagal's character went through so much anguish, seemingly losing everything he had. And then he beats the holy crap out of his enemies and nails the scum bag politician who was responsible for the whole thing. Nothing like sweet, sweet revenge. Seagal can be cheesy in other movies, but he kicked major butt in ""Hard to Kill"". You couldn't help but stand up and cheer.",1438214400,5,512,4.637362637362638
875735,4,6304437226,"After seeing it recently, and not having watched this movie in years I have to state that this has to be one of the most ridiculous action movies ever created by man.  The shear impossibility of that many heavily armed men trying to shoot down and kill only one guy, and always failing, is absolutely laughable and absurd it makes for entertaining viewing.

 When I first saw this movie when I was young I took it seriously, since Seagal at the time was a new and different style of Martial Arts star then what we had seen before with Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, & Chuck Norris.  Looking at it now, being an adult who has actually been in real life violent situations I look at this movie as pure escapism and equal to actual life authentication as a ""Star Wars"" or ""Wizard of Oz"" film.

 The funniest part is when about a thousand guys heavily armed to the teeth attack Seagal in this Japanese themed house, all attacking him one at a time.  Then the gunmen were incredibly bad shots because every single bullet out of thousands had missed it's mark.

 One funny part had been after Seagal beats up these goons in the house, two other guys armed with uzzies simply stand outside the double doors like video game characters at like a 90 degree angle, instead of firing their weapons and killing Seagal they just stand there and wait pointing their weapons out just to get killed.

 Then he drives this jeep while a sniper on the roof fires at him, on top of this helicopter hovering over raining down some lead never hitting him or Kelly LeBrock once.

 One major scene in the middle of a big night time carnival in the city in front of a hundred people Seagal gets into this death match against this large guy who was in on murdering his wife.  After a big fisticuff bout Seagal simply kills this guy in front of the crowd and walks off like he just purchased an ice cream cone!

 When he infiltrates the evil boss corrupt Senator (the actor from Die Hard & Iron Man 3) he takes on like thirty dudes, beats the snot out of this guy at a pool table with ease then kills just about everyone.  When the police arrive at the scene they automatically take Seagal's side with big high fives, ""Good job buddy you really wasted those dudes!"" letting him walk away as if he just left a boxing match or a movie theater. Can anyone imagine any major police department in the world responding to a crime scene like that & saying, ""Hey right on! Yeah thrash them all!"" ??? Lol!

 If you want to see a movie where NOTHING what so ever like that would happen in reality then watch this one.

 And then we have Kelly LeBrock, a gorgeous English model at the time who does absolutely nothing for the movie except look sexy, and provide a lady for Seagal to either rescue from the villains or to have sex with (what else are women characters for in action karate films any way right folks!  God forbid the film makers portray women as equals or human beings showing them any respect) Lol So ridiculous!  She was a good actress at the time and did really well in ""Weird Science"", yet all she is for this film is eye candy here.

So when all is said and done I give this one a B-/C+ and one thumb barely up.  Seagal did make a couple of better action films but this one was the most implausible.",1432080000,,3272,4.333333333333333

As he aged, Seagall's roles became less believable, due to the weight he put on and the deterioration of his martial arts skills.

876080,3,6304437226,"Wow, what a difference growing up makes. When I was a kid I thought that Hard to Kill was pretty hardcore. Upon watching it as an adult I realize now that it's really quite tame. With the exception of some occasional swearing there's virtually nothing here to rate the movie higher than PG-13. If the fight scenes hadn't been so poorly choreographed I suppose the R-rating might have been justified.

This was the first Seagal movie I ever saw (and Seagal's second movie, coming two years after Above the Law - just enough time for those new hair plugs to grow) and I was entertained as a child, less so now. Seagal plays the ludicrously-named Mason Storm (if there is a subtext to that naming then it's lost on me) a cop who is gunned down by crooked collegues on Oscar night in 1983 for spying on evil politician Vernon Trent (William Sadler, looking like a wimpy Neil Patrick Harris which is quite odd since he was buff and tanned in Die Hard 2 that very same summer). His wife and partner are also killed in the attack. Seven years pass and Storm wakes up in sunny 1990, where he is looked after by glamorous nurse Andy Stewart (Kelly LeBrock, who is gorgeous to look at but has acting skills that make Seagal, her then husband, look good). Storm hides away at a farmstead retreat and repairs his broken body through acupuncture and rigorous training in preparation for tearing the bad guys a new one. It happens eventually, as Storm lurks around the Senator's mansion while various character yell 'DIE' at each other, and it's all massively unspectacular.

Forget the fact that logic and common sense are thrown out here, that's a given considering the sub-genre, but my main gripe with Hard to Kill (originally titled Seven Year Storm, which sounds so much cooler) is that it suffers from really bad TV- movie casting when it comes to the supporting characters. Many of the nameless goon bad guys are played by stuntmen too, they don't have any dialogue and only exist for Seagal to slap about (he rarely kills any of these schlubs). Exactly how many crooked cops are there on Trent's pay roll? The fight scenes themselves are shot and cut with little competence and the rest of the action is so pedestrian and dull you'll resist the urge to nod off. The late Bruce Malmouth wasn't a particularly strong director and it really shows. Hard to Kill takes the cold 1970s revenge thriller (a sub-genre usually filled-out with gritty Charles Bronson vehicles) and brightens it up with a colorful, and sometimes tawdry, 1990s aesthetic. If you want a decent early Seagal movie then I suggest Marked for Death instead. It's far more vibrant, action-packed, and just plain crazy than this high-school effort.

The one brilliant thing about Hard to Kill is the wonderful score by David Michael Frank. It REALLY carries the film and gives it more emotion and punch that it actually deserves. It's such a shame that only 15 minutes of this score have been released commercially as there's so much good stuff in there. The rest...is strictly workmanlike without ever being engaging. Interesting though how porn actress Akia Athenia Garrido chose the stage name Mason Storm for her career.

Warner presents the Blu Ray in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. Both are a huge step up from the DVD but the bland TV-style photography and poor production values will never look amazing. An old trailer is the only extra. It appears there's no REAL Seagal love on Blu Ray. All of his movies get the most basic release.",1343260800,2,3504,4.701954397394137

Thank you!",1332201600,,307,3.888888888888889
876083,4,6304437226,"...this is Steven Seagal at his Steven Seagaliest. What do I mean by that? It's perhaps the silliest of his early films plot-wise (apart from his directorial debut abomination On Deadly Ground, anyway), it shows him at his most invincible (getting away from multiple bad guys while on a hospital gurney), it's got some of his best lines (""This is for my wife. *beep* you and die!"") and he's at his most over-the-top I-can-do-everything-I'm-Steven-freaking-Seagal throughout.

Basically he's an undercover cop whose family gets blown away early on after he discovers a deep mob connection involving a Senator (William Sadler, kind of wasted here). And Seagal (as ""Mason Storm"", one of his best names) is blown away too - except he lives, in a coma, somehow hidden completely away from public knowledge despite being in a regular hospital, for 7 years. Then he comes to in the presence of uber-babe Kelly LeBrock (Mrs. Steven Seagal in real life for several years) and starts trying to escape the baddies, find his old friends who can help him get the dirt on the Senator out in public, etc etc. Along the way he finds time to show off his knowledge of languages, a Seagal trademark (Chinese here), demonstrate lots of martial arts, show his Buddhist teachings (promptly to be ignored when it's time to do some killin'), and generally do plenty of bad acting and ass-kicking.

It's not really a ""good"" movie, even by low-budget action movie standards it's hardly great, but if you're a Seagal fan (and what conscious human isn't?) it is one of the must-sees; only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>&nbsp;is more fun overall I think, and that one actually IS a (pretty) good movie, with Seagal's acting being pretty close to competent, a great villain, and good New York location work.

DVD NOTE:  Seagal's movies have been endlessly repackaged in 2fers, 4-packs and the like; obviously there's no reason to spend boucoup bucks on just this one alone.  It's most often been put together with SS' previous (and first) film ABOVE THE LAW, as in this package:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steven-Seagal-Collection-Above-the-Law-Hard-to-Kill/dp/B001T21R5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steven Seagal Collection: Above the Law/Hard to Kill</a>&nbsp;which seems like it might be your best bet at the moment I'm writing this (April 2011).",1303603200,2,2488,5.641711229946524

On one hand, it's a quality vehicle from Steven Seagal's glory days that displays his strengths to near-perfection, but on the other, it's a pretty dumb follow-up to his smarter-than-average debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/6304779089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>. Rest assured, it's not a bad action movie by any means, features a couple unconventional touches not seen in other Seagal fare, and certainly belongs on any of Seagal's ""best of"" lists...but for many folks, that's not saying much.

The story: Seagal is Mason Storm - a lone wolf policeman who's made a breakthrough regarding a plot to assassinate a US senator. Before he can deliver the evidence, an attack on his home by the crooks leaves his wife dead, his son missing, and Storm himself in a coma. Protected by his friend and colleague Kevin O'Malley (Frederick Coffin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/View-from-the-Top/dp/B00005JLZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">View from the Top</a>), Storm lies unconscious for seven years until awakening to renewed assassination attempts and a thirst for revenge.

For the record, being shot and put into a coma would be the most devastating injury ever done to the near-invincible Seagal until some twenty years later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Keeper/dp/B002G1WPIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Keeper</a>. That doesn't stop him, however, from managing to outrun an assassin while still bedridden, mere minutes after he wakes up. Throw in the beard he grew during his coma and the taking off of his shirt, and you've got a respectable list of things you see in none other of his films. I suppose that's where the film's main appeal lies: he's put into situations you usually don't see him in - like needing to rebilitate himself to the tune of inspiring music - but the fact that he handles all of them in his usual superhuman way puts a bit of a damper on the thought that his character might be but a man this time around. Credit goes to director Bruce Malmuth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nighthawks/dp/B0001FGBWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nighthawks</a>) for pushing him, though.

The action is what you'd expect from Seagal at this age. The scene in the convenience store is one of the best examples of seeing practical aikido in use, but both it and the scenes that come after aren't quite as ingenius as in ""Above the Law""; in the long run, it's nothing more than Seagal taking out the garbage as usual. However, a later combination of both indoor martial arts and gunplay is one of the finest that Seagal has ever been filmed in: it's a type of scene that hadn't really existed before Seagal and its style still isn't emulated very often, so count your blessings on it. The inclusion of Kelly LeBrock (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weird-Science/dp/6305077630/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weird Science</a>) - Seagal's then-wife -  is a two-edged blade: while she gives little more than an acceptable performance, her interaction with Seagal seems to give the martial artist a confidence that he tends to lack in his usual acting and supplies him with a surprising flair that chooses to express itself during quieter scenes - I mean, when's the last time you've seen Seagal guffaw convincingly? Then again, since she was his real-life spouse, it's inevitable that they begin a relationship in the movie, and this doesn't really feel right considering that to Mason Storm, he just lost his beloved wife weeks ago; I figure they were intentionally trying to avoid drama, but it still feels weird.

However, when the bad guys get theirs, you some of the most satisfying scenes that our hero has ever uttered harsh language in: you really don't know how good you can feel for a guy until William Sadler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roswell-Seasons-1-3/dp/B000JJ6K0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roswell - Seasons 1-3</a>) is standing with a gun barrel in his mouth, being told what's going to happen to him in prison. The ability to instill this marvelous feel for vengeance earns director  Malmuth some kudos...but eventually, it feels like just another run-of-the-mill action vehicle for Steven, since the villain isn't particularly memorable and the scope of the film isn't very big. While it's more interesting than most of the films Seagal would involved in later in his career, it really doesn't top an old-fashioned, to-the-point Seagalian bloodbath like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>.

The rest you can guess. Having said its no classic, that is only by comparison to the very highest standards; as Seagal films go this is one of his best. He has ample opportunity to display his martial arts skills and it moves along with pace, and as its only just over an hour and a half long this means you won't be bored.

However the script is pretty average, and as with a lot of Seagal films it has a made for TV feel about it which does it no favours. I certainly wouldn't recommend purchasing as I don't believe it will hold up to repeated viewings. See it once and enjoy it for what it is and move on!",1215216000,,778,4.152317880794702
876124,5,6304437226,"After Above the Law's Success it was more than obvious that Steven Seagal was going to return for another movie...And so he did, but not for one movie but for 2. In 1990 Seagal had 2 theatrical releases, Marked for Death and Hard To Kill. Both of which are some of his best work. Hard to Kill has the quality of good acting and great Aikido action scenes from Seagal's part, that is not present in his more recent films.

The story of Hard to Kill centers on Mason Storm, A cop that is secretly videotaping an individual (who will later become a Senator) telling the mafia that they can rely on his political support. Stating that the can take that to the bank. Storm who thinks he is safe and hasn't been spotted is later found by thugs at his house; they brutally murder his wife and nearly kill Storm as well. He is left in a coma for 7 years, after his wake it's obvious that he is after revenge and will expose the truth he videotaped. The movie manages to show Seagal slowly train and recuperate his strength to fight once more. The movie has more fights and more linear plot than ""Above the Law"". For me this is Seagal's best movie. Main reason because it is still on the realistic level and the character he plays is not as cocky as his future roles. And his acting is much superior to that of his future films. The movie also stars Kelly Le Brock, Seagal's now ex wife.

876125,4,6304437226,"Mason Storm (Seagal) is a dangerous LA homicide cop.  So bad, in fact, an early movie exchange cements his lethality.  Storm tauntingly drops to his knees in a grocery store, whispering, ""Come and cut my heart out, come and cut my heart out!"" to a knife-wielding criminal.  It's funny because the criminal has clearly never even used a steak knife, much less attack another human being...who happens to be a black belt in aikido.  That'll cost you one fully functional ankle and fibula, Mr. Unaware Criminal.

Anyway, Storm is investigating police and political corruption.  One night he's spying on a corrupt deal where he gets audio and video evidence of a political assassination plan.  Unfortunately, he can't keep his trap shut and blabs to a friend as corrupt policemen listen in.

Once the bad guys are aware of Storm's evidence, they send a hit-squad to his house.  Completely unaware, Storm and his wife get gunned down in bed.  Luckily, Storm's young son escapes through the window, and, Storm does not die.  He's severely injured, but he's just left for dead in a coma.

Fast forward seven years...

Storm wakes up from his coma where a hot nurse (Kelly Lebrock) is attending to him.  During a pointlessly unreal scene, Lebrock lifts the sheet to look at Storm's dormant package, and openly pines for him to awake from the coma.  A guy waking from a coma to a beautiful nurse who wants to have sex with him?  What is this, a porn flick?

In a matter of no time, Storm has regained his past superhuman dexterity and strength via some light work outs and self-administered smoking acupuncture needles...because this clearly takes care of SEVEN year's worth of muscle atrophy.  And, sure enough, he and Lebrock start to fall for one another.  From vegetable to fully healthy man forgetful of his dead wife, it's borderline comical how quickly he begins romance anew with his hot, private nurse.

During this brief healing period, Storm hears a campaign ad on tv from the corrupt Senator who was involved in his assassination attempt, and this is where the classic Seagal line is uttered, ""I'm gonna take you to the bank Senator. To the blood bank!""

From there it's a confrontation with the crooked cops and politicians, where an ample amount of appendages are broken and dislocated, and Mason Storm triumphantly delivers pain before walking off during the credit roll with his new woman, his long lost son, and a plethora of bleeding bad guys in his wake.

Classic Seagal, great movie.",1214697600,,2494,4.818823529411764
876126,4,6304437226,"I like action movies, and Steven Seagal movies are a guilty pleasure. This, I think, is one of his better ones.

Cop Mason Storm (Steven Seagal) overhears something he shouldn't have, and the bad guys come after him, his wife, and his son. His wife dies, and Storm is in a coma, hidden away under an assumed name by the one trustworthy cop on the force.

Seven years later, he wakes up and asks his nurse (Kelly LeBrock) to get him out of the hospital--with a little extra convincing from the bad guys who start shooting up the place to get him, she complies.

They hide out while he recuperates and trains and regains his strength, then he goes after the bad guys.

Like most Steven Seagal movies, it's a little overdone, a little unbelievable, but it's fun. Seagal is the same character he always plays, and the dry, serious delivery of his lines always works for me. Unfortunately, Kelly LeBrock seemed to be trying to mimic him, and she just sounded wooden. Eh. She was probably eye candy for the male audience anyway. The little bit of romance was sweet, and the action was exciting and interspersed with humor. Best of all, the ending was very satisfying--you never need to worry about the bad guys not getting what's coming to them in a Steven Seagal movie.",1214524800,,1264,4.5550660792951545

876128,4,6304437226,"In 1990, after an excruciating two year wait, the film world was blessed with Steven Segal's second masterpiece, Hard to Kill. The work of cinematic art also stars William Sadler(Heywood from Shawshank Redemption), and Kelly LeBrock. LeBrock and Segal were actually married at the time this film was made. LeBrock was one of the hottest chicks in the 80's, then ballooned up enough to cement her status as B with a Celebrity Fit Club appearance a couple years ago. How did Segal land her? How has he fooled people enough to appear in 20 films? It's like the guy has the whole world hypnotized. Considering how irrelevant they both are now, how funny is it that they were married. And until 1996. I can't even imagine how their relationship was at the end there. Did Segal divorce her because she finally beat him in a hot dog eating contest and he couldn't stand it? I don't get it, but it somehow adds to the b of Hard to Kill doesn't it? You know what else does? The plot.

In the movie, Segal plays Mason Storm, no seriously. Storm is a cop(shocker!) who films some mobsters and a politician making some illicit deal. When he gets home, corrupt cops who are in on the deal, shoot up Segal and his family. His wife is dead, Segal is in a coma, and his son jumps out the window but survives. Words cannot do it justice, believe me it was awesome. And a little tough to take. Segal got totally lit up. Sid always thought Segal's ponytail grease would save him somehow in moments like this. And, one of the corrupt cops was the guy who got forked in the hand by Denton Vachs! If you don't know what movie that's from, shame on you.

So, Segal is in a coma for SEVEN years. And his smoking hot nurse falls in love with him while he's in the coma. Are they serious? Were they intentionally going for the soap opera parallels? The portion of the movie that featured Segal in the coma and trying to recover from being a vegetable for seven years was the best in the movie. It kept on giving. There was the unforgettably uncomfortable scene when LeBrock lifts up Segal's bedsheet while he's in the coma to get a look at the Segalsage. Her reaction when she saw it: ""PLEASE wake up."" Oh the baby! Then, once Segal was out of his coma, he gave himself acupuncture to regain the muscle function in his legs. Read that again. Obviously, Segal gets his son back. The kid has been living with Segal's old partner. Segal ends up finding out that Senator Vernon ""And you can take that to the bank!"" Trent was the politician talking with the mobsters the night he got shot. So, he goes to Trent's mansion and kills like 15 of Trent's men before holding the Senator at gunpoint. Just then, the cops bust in! And they don't arrest Segal, they arrest the U.S. Senator. Then, Segal is walking away with his son, the old tape Segal shot is playing-and it ends. The credits roll, as they would in any self-respecting B.

Hard to Kill will be as ridiculous for you to watch as it was for Sid to try to review. But, if you can watch it while imagining Segal and a buddy sitting in Segal's house trying to write the script it will be just a hilarious, transcendent movie watching experience. The number of times Seagal said things like, ""Yeah, then I have atrophy from the coma. And I...I give myself acupuncture to cure it!"" must have been astounding. And, this movie has historical significance. It is the first time Segal wasn't indestructible in his movies. The only other time this happened was in Executive Decision. During that filming, Segal's tantrum over the fact that he dies in the movie held up shooting for three days. That's the Segal we all know and love, with an ego as big as his giant gut. So, if you feel like laughing at the man who once gave us the quote: ""I am hoping that I can be known as a great writer and actor some day, rather than a sex symbol"" then watch Hard to Kill. Sid recommends!",1210204800,3,3891,4.393897364771151

With Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chuck Norris and so many other better talents available, there is no reason to waste time with minor leaguers. Steven is to martial arts as K-Fed is to music.

This movie is loaded with martial arts and gun fights. There is more martial arts in this movie than in any other Seagal movie. There are multiple times in this movie where Seagal puts away his gun so he can hand out a beating using aikido. One of the best fights is in the liquor store where Seagal tells his four attackers ""Oh, my gun makes this unfair. I'll put it away. How about if I kneel too. Will that make it more fair"". Eventually the bad guy attacks and gets multiple broken bones by Seagal.

This is an action film, when was the last time an action film was supposed to be completely realistic. In this movie Seagal's character is Mason Storm, a high ranking detective who is violently murdered along with his wife by hitmen (fellow LAPD detectives) whom are corrupt and close-knit with an up and coming senatorial candidate Vernon Trent, after he learns of Seagal secretly taping a planned hit of his while undercover at a dock (beginning of the movie).

7871031,5,6304437226,"""Hard To Kill"" is one of Steven Seagal's best action movies.  It was made when he was still a clean-cut action hero who looked eerily like the original comic book's Captain Marvel of shazam fame. His co-star in this movie is his ex-wife model Kelly LeBrock. (She's reason enough to see this movie). Waking from a 7-year coma, police detective Mason Storm (Seagal) embarks on a mission to avenge his murdered wife.  In the process, he tracks down and beats up a corrupt senator; and he single-handedly dismembers the members of an entire department of crooked cops.  The poolroom scene is a classic. After delivering a fatal kick to his wife's killer, he delivers the immortal line, ""F*** you and die!""  Partly because of that line, I suspect this movie will continue to gain in cult status; and mainly because the movies satisfaction of revenge works as a powerful sublimation for anyone harboring some unresolved hostility...which probably includes myself and the majority of mankind. The movie's creative sound track by David Michael Frank adds greatly to its intensity.  This classic is a ""must have"" for Seagal fans.",1513209600,,1120,4.967914438502674
