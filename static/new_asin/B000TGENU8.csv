8208998,1,B000TGENU8,This was a gift from Santa  my autistic son wrote a letter to him for he is obsessed with baby Einstein I find this package and its exactly what he wants the first picture is what actually CAME  the second and third are what is SUPPOSED to be and what i was paying for and the third is the packaging. Im disappointed because my son keeps repeating what are you missing his way in his limited communication telling me that this is not right. Thats the beyond fixable let down and heart ache if I could give it no stars I would,1514419200,,525,4.137254901960785

8209000,5,B000TGENU8,"So creative, big bright pictures.  Great way to introduce baby to good music.  Very soothing.  Not meant to be used as a babysitter but as stimulus for baby while sitting in the swing or chair. I has my doubts about this until I saw them and now this Grandma is sold on them.",1245974400,,275,4.150943396226415
8209001,1,B000TGENU8,"I completely agree with the 2-star review posted earlier (except about the number of stars :-P ).. These DVDs are BORING, NOT AT ALL educational (don't fall for the ""Baby Einstein"" branding), SUPER MEANINGLESS, use stupid correlations, VERY limited vocabulary, FLAT IMAGERY, and UGLY PUPPETS - and what a waste of money! My alert 4-month old daughter showed zero interest in any of these videos + as well as B.E. Lullaby video.. And I do own a lot of B.E. books - which are great, but what a disappointment with their DVDs.. If you are looking for a great DVD for your baby just get 4 Fisher-Price DVDs: Baby's Day, Baby Moves, Nature Baby, and Musical Baby (especially first 3). BELIVE ME, it's like night and day compared with Baby Einstein DVD series..",1243296000,,755,4.684210526315789

Baby Einstein stage 1-7 videos slog along painfully slowly, and the simplistic, paper-cut-out characters make you wonder why you didn't just make some puppets and act things out for your baby instead. You would be much more engaging to more of your baby's senses! These DVD's are for people who will never personally engage their baby with age-appropriate toys, songs, flashcards and books.  Baby Einstein is drivel! If your baby is alert, attentive and active, you will definitely slow them down with Baby Einstein.  You can do waaaaaayyy better yourself with your own version of live animation as you act out songs and stories for your baby (and involve more of their senses than just a simple DVD).",1235433600,4,877,5.889763779527559
8209003,5,B000TGENU8,"These dvds are amazing. They keep my 3-month old's attention and they can always calm him down when he is upset. He could watch these over and over. The music is calming for him. I love them for my child, and would recommend them for any parent.",1232928000,5,245,4.23404255319149
