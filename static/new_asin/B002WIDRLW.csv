8383082,1,B002WIDRLW,"If you have the other Secret Policeman's Balls DVDs, don't buy this one. It's just badly edited highlights of everything you've seen before, and in worse condition than the originals. They ought to be embarrassed to charge money for this! If you've been trying to decide whether to buy the box set of Secret Policeman's Balls, DO buy it--it's great.",1270944000,6,349,4.833333333333333

8383084,3,B002WIDRLW,"It's just badly spliced bits of sketches and songs from a stage show with fuzzy sound and inconsistent video quality.  Worst rendition of ""The Lumberjack Song"" I've ever heard.  Granted, some very funny bits, and nice live performances from Phil Collins, Pete Townshend, Bob Geldof, and Dame Edna, but not enough to make it worth owning.  Rent it for some fun.  If you feel guilty about ripping off Amnesty International (who received a portion of the movie's sales), send them a check.",1138060800,,486,4.890243902439025
