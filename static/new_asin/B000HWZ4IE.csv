2645035,5,B000HWZ4IE,"This is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched! 7th Haven is not only wholesome but good clean fun. Most of the Tv shows are full of sex, violence low moral, and foul language, but 7th Heaven has a higher standard. I am sorry to see that this show is no longer on the air, but am so pleased and overjoyed that I can buy the series on DVD.

For those of you who don't know, this season is about Annie Camden give birth to twins  In other developments, Annie's widowed father, Charles Jackson (Graham Jarvis), has a big surprise for the whole Camden family. Matt Camden (Barry Watson) kindles his romance with a former girlfriend and Lucy Camden still has boyfriend trouble. There is always continuing issues with Mary (Jessica Biel). She is still in the awkward stages of being trapped between tough rough teenage years and trying to be an adult. And as for the youngest Camden son Simon (David Gallagher) undergoing his first love.

This show will be missed! Thank you for a good 10 years!",1156636800,13,995,4.456043956043956

It's grainy, gritty, it skips, sound is all over from too loud one second to can't hear the next, and it has weird lines across the screen half the time. It's definitely not our internet either and the pic I'll add is wireless connection, our wired is near 800 down and 800 up on average.",1484265600,,355,4.393939393939394

The Camden's don't have any trouble grounding or disciplining their older kids but they let her get away with murder.",1447200000,,379,4.544117647058823

They have great family, show true situations which people go through, and how to deal with those situations in a way which honors Jesus Christ.",1445904000,,284,4.377358490566038
2645264,5,B000HWZ4IE,"This is a great show about a big family where the mother has CHOSEN to stay at home.
 Not because she isn't competent at other things, or confident that she can succeed, but because she actually understands the value of being home when her kids need her!  While her kids don't always understand this... I think it's beautiful.
I think it's great that she and her husband are a team and neither downgrades the other to get permission to be.

So many other ""family shows"" downgrade the husband in so many ways and reduce him to the position of begging for sex and being otherwise pointless in the house.

This show finds the balance.  Just because the father isn't as good at cooking or plumbing doesn't make him useless or laughable.
I love that this is a show that illustrates how two people can truly live as equals and raise a family.  Together.
I also adore the fact that this show doesn't pigeonhole the genders into ""mechanically inclined males"" and "" girly girls"".

In fact, I think the only major misstep of this show was the one caused by the contract struggles with Jessica Biel, which forced the show producers to make up a reason why this Christian family would give up on their oldest daughter.  A reason that doesn't quite ring true after you've seen them jump to the rescue of strangers with worse issues.

Other than that I LOVE this show!",1444953600,,1354,4.539094650205762

Until our leaders understand Father Barron's comment that we are all hardwired for God and that any substitute: wealth, power, pleasure or honor will not satisfy, our political and economic and social problems will only get worse.  The Camden family is not saints, but they do understand that a family predicated on the love and worship of God, best manifested by serving others, will bit by bit, lead to a better world.

It wasn't until the late spring or early summer of 1998 (the end of the 2nd Season) that I first found out about 7th Heaven and started watching this WONDERFUL series.

So this was the first season that I saw on TV in its entirety, during its original/premiere airing on TV.

From the first episode I saw of this series, I LOVED this show (though the love started waning a bit in the 4th and 5th season and getting stronger with each following season) I loved the show I am so glad to have the original uncut version on DVD!

Unfortunately this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-Season-3/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven: Season 3</a>&nbsp;DVD set, is the LAST season set, in this 11-season series that offers the original uncut episodes of the show. Starting with the DVD release of Season 4, the manufacturers of these DVD sets (CBS/Paramount) began churning out DVD sets with shoddily-cut, syndicated (or actually WORSE than syndicated, because at least in syndication, the show is professionally edited, and NOT usually aired with scenes that are cut in the middle of a dialogue/sentence or song!) episodes of the show -- and coincidentally, the 4th season was, IMHO, when the show began to ""jump the shark"" with the systematic (and incredibly unbelievable) destruction of the character of Mary, and although I still liked and continued to watch most of the later season's episodes during the remainder of the series, in all honesty, I think that Season 3 is not only the LAST decent DVD set for this series, but also the last great season of the show itself!

In any case, I still highly recommend this DVD set to every 7th Heaven fan. But those who don't know about, or have never seen 7th Heaven should first watch some of this show's episodes on TV (which now airs in syndication on the ""Up"" cable channel --which used to be called GMC or the ""Gospel Music Channel"") just to make sure it is a show they'd like to have in their collection.

I LOVE 7th Heaven!! My favorite episodes in this season is "".......And a Nice Chianti"" in which the Camdens help a pregnant girl, Mary learns the REAL reason why her younger sisters and brother don't want to ride in the car with her when she is driving, and Eric helps a woman find the donor recipients of her late son's organs. I also  several other episodes including ""The Legacy"", in which Simon helps a teacher who is suspended, ""Cutters"" in which Mary discovers that Lucy's friend cuts herself (being a recovering self-injurer myself, I really related to this episode -- although IMHO, it could've been done better, with less ""cheese""), ""..........And the Home of the Brave"", in which Annie's widowed father is getting remarried & Annie befriends a homeless man who ends up cooking for the reception while Matt & Mary wind up on an endless road trip, and ""Here Comes Santa Clause"", one of the few Christmas-theme episodes in this series. There are other episodes in this season that I also like, but those mentioned are my top favorites!!

I also LOVE the packaging of the DVDs in this season. Because UNLIKE in Season 1 and Season 2, which came packaged in individual plastic ""slim-line"" cases housed in a cardboard box,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-Season-3/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven -Season 3</a>&nbsp;comes packaged in a single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs, which I much rather PREFER!!

I am kind of anal about my DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.

But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case  (like the DVD case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>&nbsp;among others!)  which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

I LOVE the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-Season-3/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven: Season 3</a>&nbsp;DVD set -- and just about my ONLY complaint is that there are NO Special Features or Bonuses. NO deleted scenes, NO bloopers, no commentary, no interviews with cast or producers/directors, no trailers, NOTHING!

It's really disappointing!

When people buy DVDs (especially for TV shows), many times its so that they can get special features that they would NOT otherwise be able to get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should really take that into consideration, and include at least a few extras to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (like Full House and Who's the Boss?) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the usually at least $20 minimum retail price!

But aside from the lack of special features, this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-Season-3/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven: Season 3</a>&nbsp;DVD set is still GREAT (though very BASIC) and HEAVEN-SENT!!!

2645749,4,B000HWZ4IE,"This show has life lessons compressed into a complex web of story lines and themes that run through the series of episodes. There are some secular and political messages embedded that are counter to Biblical messages and may pass off as Biblical to those unfamiliar with the faith. For example, the show leans towards the political left which most often promotes secular social issues that are against Judeo-Christian Biblical values. Additionally, the show points towards the Protestant church but fails to relate the belief in terms of Christ mentioning only an esoteric God. Christ was not mentioned until Season 6 episode 7 in a lesson on works that was not fully presented but supported the storyline of that episode. In short, critical elements of the a ministers life are omitted and sensitive social topics are not explored. The show is best as entertainment and should not be considered an honest treatment of the Judeo-Christian belief.",1376092800,,946,5.109677419354838

Sam and David are born expanding the Camden Brood to seven, Eric suffers his heart attack, heart concerns would appear on and off throughout the rest of the series. Throughout it all, the focus on serious issues continues including ""Drunk Like Me"" were a friend of Matt's has too much to drink during a paternity initiation. Cutters exposes the phenomenon of cutting something I'd never heard of before this episode. Johnny Get Your Gun where a troubled ex-boyfriend of Deena's threatens to shoot Simon only to end up shooting Eric instead. In No Sex, Some Drugs, and a Little Rock and Roll, Mary's friend has a massive heart attack after using ephedra based pills, years before the use of ephedra was nationally discussed as a problem. Another moving episode is All Dogs Go to Heaven as Eric counsels a couple on what to do about their elderly dog. Beyond all the high drama and real life issues, important story development occurs as well. Matt breaks up Heather's wedding, and we are introduced to Carlos who would later become Mary's husband.

2645881,5,B000HWZ4IE,"I enjoyed watching this series. It is wholesome and shows that no one is perfect, not even the parents. Some of the shows are aimed at problems facing our nation today. For example, one show portrayed a very angry teenager who threatened to shoot Simon Camden. His father refused to believe he would shoot any one, saying the pranks he played were part of growing up. But he sang a different song at the end of the show when his son was sentenced to a  State correctional facility until he was 25 years old. It shows also that ""preacher's kids"" are no different than any others. They have the same problems/hang-ups as anyone else.",1219017600,,631,4.535087719298246

2645931,5,B000HWZ4IE,"I love 7TH HEAVEN, which is TV's longest-running family comedy-drama.  While season eleven (!) keeps going in prime time on Sunday nights, season three is on DVD and season four is on the way.  This was one of the late Aaron Spelling's crown jewels in forty years of producing evening TV dramas, and Brenda Hampton is the creator and still head writer after eleven seasons.  And the cast is just impeccable:  Stephen Collins and Catherine Hicks as parents Eric and Annie Camden; and, in descending order as their five kids, Barry Watson as college-age Matt, Jessica Biel as basketball lover and independent Mary, Beverley Mitchell as boy-obsessed Lucy, David Gallagher as teenage Simon, and Mackenzie Rosman as precocious little Ruthie (who doesn't seem so little when she and a boyfriend get tattoos in season 11).

Watch season 11 in prime time (Sunday night on the CW network), then put on a season three DVD episode; it is like looking through a very special family album.  Were the kids ever that little?  Season three, which I am reviewing here, is a wonderful time capsule DVD.  I think I like it more than season 11.  Season 11 is more sex-obsessed with everyone and not as carefully written as season 3.  And, of course, it is a treat and an honor to have all 22 season 3 episodes in one convenient DVD that is uncut and non-commercial on six disks.  Conflicts may be resolved too easily, but the show gets into some powerful themes and is superbly acted.

Each disk has four episodes that are about 45 minutes each without commercials.  In disk 1 Annie announces that she is pregnant, a frat house initiation is almost fatal, and Lucy's new girl friend is a (wrist) cutter.

In disk 2, Matt gets arrested and his car stolen while helping a girl with phony car trouble.  Ray Walston guest stars in a wonderful performance as a homeless WW2 vet who helps the Camdens all appreciate life more.  And Eric's old rock band trio arrives for a chaotic visit.

In disk 3, Mom Annie is more and more pregnant, while Lucy considers having sex (in season 11 she is a wife and loving mother!) and Mary sneaks away to a coed sleepover.  A memorable Christmas episode.  Mary just barely passes her driving test.  And Eric and Annie learn that Dr. Hastings, who almost killed Matt at birth, might deliver the twins.

Disk 4 is the biggie on this DVD set.  Twins Sam and David are born in a very poignant and emotional episode with a lovely finale, then come home from the hospital; what a lovely singing voice Beverly Mitchell (Lucy) has in putting the twins to sleep.  And Lucy's ex-boyfriend may be involved with drugs.

In disk 5, Eric counsels a couple who want to divorce, while Matt temporarily joins the Army to pay for college.  The college dean is threatened with expulsion after an extra-marital affair.  An aging, but dedicated janitor may have to resign or be fired for age.  And a wonderful dog may have to be put to sleep because (s)he is dying and in pain.

Disk 6 is a two hour season finale--one wedding is stopped in the middle, another takes place, and a lot of people reconcile improbably but optimistically for a radiant happy ending.

7TH HEAVEN is a TV series gem to highly recommend, present and past.  Again, Sunday night on the CW network, and seasons 1 through 3 on DVD, with season 4 in the wings.  The series is at its zenith in season three.  Kudos, especially, to head writers Brenda Hampton and Sue Tenney; and to a world-class cast.  If Catherine Hicks was not really pregnant in disks 1 through 3 of season three, then she is one of the great actresses; and Stephen Collins seems so like a suburban California minister that one wants to write him with religious concerns.  And again, bouncing back and forth between season 11 live and season 3 on DVD is truly like flipping through a nostalgic family album to cherish.  Season 3 is definitely worth buying to have the entire 22 episode season in one convenient boxed set, uncut and non-commercial, at a reasonable price.",1172016000,17,3998,4.622695035460993
2645932,5,B000HWZ4IE,"This has kept us all entertained for hours and hours over the winter vacation when we were looking for indoor cozy time.  It has led to lots of healthy discussion.

It appeals to our family, with a variety of ages from 11 to the Grandparents.  It leads to shared discussion and enjoyment across the generations.",1168473600,,503,4.670454545454546
2645933,5,B000HWZ4IE,"This programme is hardly cutting edge, but if you're looking for a temporary escape into a rose tinted feel-good world, this could be just the ticket. You do need to rise above the obvious propaganda, as each episode contains a moral about one of the many vices inflicting teenage America. However, for viewers of the later series on US tv, these messages are less obvious in the earlier seasons. Although billed as family entertainment, I'm not sure there are too many male fans over the age of 12 out there. This is a programme that cynics will hate and indeed find uncomfortable to watch. There is a gentle sweetness to 7th Heaven which is rarely seen in modern programming, a certain nostalgic value. The performances from the lead actors are believable and endearing.",1168473600,3,772,4.81203007518797

2645982,5,B000HWZ4IE,"FINALLY!!!!  Finally the third season of 7th heaven has surfaced.  My only complaint is that it's too far away!!  7th Heaven is just down right good, wholesome, family entertainment.  Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the show or just got started watching in the last few years this show is enjoyable through every minute of watching.  I can't wait to own my copy!!!!",1157587200,15,370,4.809523809523809
2645983,5,B000HWZ4IE,"With no announcement for 7th Heaven's third season after the February 2005 release of season two (unless you count the temporary, roughly estimated release date that was quickly cancelled due to poor sales from the original two boxed sets), many longtime fans of this historical television series resorted themselves to the thought that no DVD treatment would be given to the several remaining seasons. Now, a year and a half later, we have been pleasantly surprised to find that the next season will be out on DVD in November--just in time for the holidays, too!

The gradual progression and success of 7th Heaven has, in tune with its title, been something of a modern-day miracle. Eternally repetitive plot threads and weak writing have characterized the show's most recent years, but think of how this particular series stacks up against contemporary classics like ""The Waltons"" and ""Little House on the Prairie."" The timeless themes of family, Christian values, and survival against life's turmoils were at the heart of those two TV shows, and now they have also transformed 7th Heaven into a unique viewing experience that legions of fans clearly still love to watch. The decision to resurrect the show after the highly publicized and allegedly ""final"" 10th season is truly a miraculous feat, and while that choice has been quite a controversial one, anyone who grew up watching 7th Heaven can't help but be curious about the seemingly interesting and dramatic ideas that are being planned for Season 11.

7th Heaven has undoubtedly aged over time, but I give this particular Season 3 five stars for its fresh, vibrant, and youthful spirit. Many can argue that this is where the series officially took off, with the five original Camden kids beginning to grow into more independent, fleshed-out characters. The news of Annie's pregnancy in the season opener and the birth of their twin boys on Valentine's Day (that makes seven kids total for lovebirds Eric and Annie!) are the most obvious highlights from this year, but there are many other unique, well-written episodes that chronicle the daily events in the lives of a growing, changing American family. Oldest son Matt has a great relationship going with his girlfriend until an old flame re-enters his life, while the ever-famous high school junior Mary thrives with basketball and academics (savor this season, folks: it is the one where Mary is at the top of her game, before she begins her gradual downhill spiral and before viewers witness the shattering of both her confidence and her future in Season 4). Sweet, insecure sophomore Lucy develops new friendships with some girls at school (including a classmate who is a cutter) and foolishly dives into a relationship with an older guy in order to have a rare edge over her superachieving older sister. Middle schooler Simon is the same levelheaded, inquisitive child who suddenly finds himself threatened by a gun-holding classmate, and brassy little second grader Ruthie--who is no longer the baby of the family--revolts against the extensive attention being given to her new brothers. The strong and incredibly sweet chemistry between Eric and Annie reigns supreme, through good times and bad. Catherine Hicks' work on this show has always been somewhat up-and-down, but in my opinion this third season was her finest hour. She really delivered head-on as a patient, loving and emotional middle-aged woman, mothering five children of varying ages and pregnant with two more. I absolutely loved the season premiere, where she was screaming at Eric about the chicken. Hicks really had an opportunity to show her comedic flair here, and at the same time she did an outstanding job at portraying a mother struggling to take care of her large family. Furthermore, the types of people whom Reverend Eric Camden counsels and supports through his work remain very interesting and are fueled by his kind, consistent guidance with alcoholic husbands, 12-year-old kids with guns, self-destructive teenagers, and (a popular favorite with the writers) young pregnant women. All of these ingredients make for a successful season that is arguably one of 7th Heaven's very best, and it should not be missed.

Season 3 holds up quite nicely with a positive message and youthful energy that fans will love revisiting. It is certainly worth the purchase if you're a fan, and it's a good idea to show your support if you want to see future seasons on DVD. There's a generous number of seasons still to be released, and whether or not we will see them all on DVD is about as much unknown as the official conclusion of the series itself (hopefully they will bow out for good after the impending Season 11, but you just never know). Purchasing all those seasons on DVD would be quite an investment, but worth every penny if this is a show you love.

Also, as indicated on the cover art picture, the packaging is a bit different from the first 2 sets, which may disappoint those who really liked the individual jewel cases for each disc. This time around, it is one single jewel case with all six discs inside. The episode guide/synopses are displayed very nicely, too, so fans shouldn't be too disappointed with the change.

Perhaps the best news of all, though, is that only mere weeks after the release of this season, the Season 4 set was announced for March 2007! It is excellent news to see that they appear to be picking up the pace with the many more sets they still have to put out, although I still don't understand why it is so difficult for them to come up with some extras. For a show that has remained on the air for 11 seasons (and counting) and is hailed as the longest-running drama series in history, you can't tell me that there is no interesting behind-the-scenes footage for them to add to the DVD's. A show running that long absolutely has to have a unique story about how they reached that point and what it has meant for the actors who have stuck with them. I just have a hard time believing that, at the very least, they couldn't scounge up a couple of interviews, ESPECIALLY for a series that is still on the air. I'm sure Stephen Collins and Beverley Mitchell, in particular (the only two cast members to appear in every episode to date and, arguably, the most passionate actors on the show) wouldn't have a problem with doing a few commentaries, either, so why haven't we seen them? Granted, I buy these DVD's primarily for the episodes and will continue to buy any and all seasons that they choose to release, but for a $34.99 (approximately) charge per season, a little something extra would be nice.",1157068800,52,6626,4.860176991150443
2645984,5,B000HWZ4IE,"7th heaven is by far one of the best shows on television in years...Yes, they said that they were ending the show after the 10th season, however, The CW just announced that the Show is RETURNING For an 11th season in September!! So don't be disappointed!  I can't wait for all the seasons to come out on DVD because this will be a collection that will last through the ages, somewhat like Andy Griffith Show or something of the sort...",1156809600,5,435,4.4375
8141865,4,B000HWZ4IE,"I wasn't sure if I would like the show,...maybe I thought it would be cheesy and maybe too fluffy... but it is not.  This show deals with real issues, that families across the US face daily.... but this show... they deal with them every episode.  The parenting style is loose but encouraging and trusting.  What I mean by that is that they do not scream, or yell even when a situation seem extreme.  They want their kids to find the answers.

Why I took away one star...is because of how they deal with the character Ruthie.  The young girl is always mouthing off, lying, stealing, cutting off others and demanding. And not until most of the way thought season 4 do they ""finally teach her about consequences"".  Not until second grade??  That is way too unrealistic.  I had been a professional nanny for years, birth though 7 years...
It was too much watching the baby of the family always get her way, and being rewarded for bad behavior, and not doing anything about it.  Love the parents and the other actors.  Love how the delve into topics too.
Yes they are a religious family, but don't let that scare you away even if you are not religious.  Good show.

8141868,2,B000HWZ4IE,"""What [belligerent blasphemy] hath put together let to man [nor woman] cast asunder"" was the topic of Season 3 Episode 18 in re the University President found to have engaged in consensual sexual relations with a student at that university.  Along with felony tax evasion, the initial felonious enslavement in violation of Article XIII of the US Constitution in their majority divorce racketeering fraudocracy of ""marriage"", hate mongering against male citizens, and the rest of their crimes against humanity and the Constitution of the United States of America, such interference with mutually agreeable human assocations is a cornerstone of the criminal ""religion"" gangs extending even to prosecutions of such relationships between ""singles"", imposition of object rape con dumbs on places of worship of hetero religion, brutal taxation of ""singles"" not compliant with the enslavement and population littering objectives, and compulsory same gender bedroom partners at such colleges and universities thereby defrauding students of any place to study anything other than their intended homosexual regimentation.  Calling monogamessy population littering ""leading by example"" was a particularly offensive line from the criminal gang minister father during the presentation.  The notion of ""best for the university"" which predictably has been imposing *homosexual* regimentation onto nonconsenting young people is flagrantly absurd.  Unusually for Wholly Weird's heterophobic orientation, the outcome allowed for a two star rating for this discussion of criminal gang intrusion into private relationships even with the subsequent expansion of belligerent blasphemy in Episode 19.",1500768000,,1677,5.946058091286307
