8620276,1,B001LJXME0,"I would have loved to have watched this product, but not being as tech savvy as I should have been, only realized after getting the product that since it came from the UK, we couldn't play it on our DVD player....the signals between the 2 countries ( Canada and the UK) are different, which I knew, and our DVD player is old. Too bad I didn't put 2 and 2 together. I will say the products ( I bought another DVD from Amazon.com) came very promptly and sooner than expected. I will continue to buy from Amazon.com, but will be more observant in the details, like where the product is coming from.",1325548800,,595,4.321428571428571
