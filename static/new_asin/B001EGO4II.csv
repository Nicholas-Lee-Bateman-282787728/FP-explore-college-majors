3553982,5,B001EGO4II,"For those old enough to remember, this DVD has the first classic episodes still with the same original characters & opening theme, just as it was in the early 1990's. The Biker Mice From Mars VHS tapes are now obsolete! This DVD set is a must have for all Biker Mice From Mars fans.",1232755200,9,282,4.2407407407407405
3553983,5,B001EGO4II,"As a kid growing up, I spent a huge part of my childhood watching cartoons.  Now as an adult, I'm always on the look out for cool cartoons.  Unfortunately, the pickings are slim.  Thankfully, wonderful cartoons like Biker Mice from Mars are now on dvd.  This cartoon rocked!  The characters are great and heck I loved everything about this show.  I'm now waiting for season 2 to be released.  I love this show.",1232582400,2,410,4.534246575342466

3553985,4,B001EGO4II,"Being a fan of the show growing up, I was only a little bit troubled with the results.  True, it is the first season and jam packed with bros and bikes, but some of the shows were cut.  Not too much, to take away from the plot, but just small parts that helped show how brotherly the bros could be. ""RoadRavens"" and ""The Pits"" are samples of what epi. I'm referring too.",1231804800,15,370,4.125

3553988,5,B001EGO4II,What can I Say? A big piece of my childhood. I mean I'm 22 and i still have a crush on Vinnie. It's just one of those great examples of what cartoons today should have been.,1230422400,2,173,3.8333333333333335

8298056,3,B001EGO4II,"Being a fan of Biker Mice from Mars since childhood, I was SO excited when this came out to buy. However when I actually received it I was slightly disappointed.
Some episodes are cut, for obvious possible PG stuffs, and it ticked me off.

At first it was slightly unnoticed, left me thinking it was just me...however when I watched a VHS recorded episode...I only have half of...It didn't quite match the DVD. Now ratings and all are fine and dandy but, there's a time and a place for them and in Biker Mice from Mars...it's neither.

So, all in all, the DVD's are okay, Graphic quality is fantastic, sound quality is great...but if you watched the Bro's savin the world you will notice the obvious scene cuts.",1333324800,,711,4.546875
8298057,5,B001EGO4II,"I was so happy when I found out the 1st season was released. I missed this show so much. I was very disappointed when I found parts of the episodes had been cut. Most of what was cut were scenes where the mice would randomly break out in song so it probably has to do with song rights or something...it's so sad :'( Still I love this series and I wish they'd release seasons 2 & 3 because I would totally buy those, too.",1312502400,2,420,4.011904761904762
8298058,5,B001EGO4II,"Item was very good condition, except for the 2nd CD holder, which was broken. But that may be from postage handling",1305590400,,115,4.523809523809524
8298059,5,B001EGO4II,"Yes, this is awesome to own. The pic. quality is good, and it is the original BMFM series. However, certain episodes were cut, not to the point of ruining the show, but for those who remember the episodes it may erk you. A song was completly edited out of one episode (they were on a train), and so on. Also, don't quote me on this, but I believe that Disney now owns the show..not fully sure. If you want more BMFM then turn to a differnt sort of mouse for more. Personally, edited or not, I would love to have the entire series on DVD/ BLUE RAY. So let's move on and get us some biker mice season 2- .",1295654400,2,603,4.033333333333333
8298060,5,B001EGO4II,I gave this video to my son for Christmas.  He said it is awesome!!!  Wondering if you have anymore dvds of Biker Mice compatible to Canada.  Am really interested in more.,1294876800,,171,4.451612903225806
8298061,3,B001EGO4II,"The Biker Mice From Mars DVD set arrived as promised but there was damage to the inside of the casing. The dvd itself refused to play beyond a certain point and the editing of the episodes was a little disappointing. After returning the product, I didn't hear from the company. If you find a good quiality dvd of this series, then it is worth the effort of finding it.",1246406400,,368,4.3478260869565215
8298062,5,B001EGO4II,"This is just to cool! I have this dvd as I finally found it. There a few errors as one review said about to blurry and out of focus well yeah that is true about it like skipped a few parts of most episodes and alot of them the intro and going right away to the adventure name. I think because of that there needs to be a recall for editing and install the missing parts of most of the episodes and put in each the intro. But overall still a good dvd! no matter what condition you buy this dvd you'll see the errors and request a recall. But good job with this dvd though. Brillant restored classic show, And last but not least digitally remasted to original format good job just Rick Ungar show creator do that dvd recall for editing the missing part episodes The reeking regin of the head cheese parts 1 and 2, test of friendship, the pits, and hard rock. And release seasons 2,3, and the new seasons as soon as possible. Oh and one more thing put in the intro the specifically missing in each episode on this dvd. And scan for errors that they may have to and edit them. What condition did some of you get this in used or new Do any of the errrors occur in your cpoies? Reply soon.",1238198400,,1183,4.125541125541125
8298063,4,B001EGO4II,"I am overall very happy with this product. A couple disappointments:

1. The image on the item page creates the illusion that you are buying a 2 disc, 2 case, ""box"" set. However, you are only buying a 2 disc, 1 case set with no box. Again, it is just a single DVD case, with 2 discs.

2. At times the cartoons are blurry and out of focus. This isn't a huge problem as it isn't bad enough to take away from the overall video. Just a little disappointing.

All-in-all a great buy. If you're like me and miss the quality cartoons of the 90's and can't seem to find anything that quite measures up these days, I'd definitely recommend this set!",1234742400,13,640,4.229508196721311
