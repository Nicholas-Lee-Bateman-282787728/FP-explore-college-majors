It's an on-stage re-creation of Drever's studio album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Water/dp/B000P46QG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Water</a>, which I already knew to be a beauty.  Played live by this ensemble of stellar musicians, this music, these songs become even more engaging, dramatic and heart-lifting.  There's a subtle undercurrent of dedication to and love of music in everyone's performance that enriches the result.  From Drever's handsome, anchoring guitar and vocals through the breathless, swiftly intricate guitar and fiddle work of the instrumental tunes there's never a moment to fault.  Braw sailing on this folk music sea, indeed!

The DVD extras--mostly short interviews--sustain the on-stage atmosphere created by seriously talented yet unassuming, laid-back musicians who've known and admired one another for years and simply enjoy playing together.",1233446400,,1007,6.590909090909091
