It's really a great workout, challenging and very involving.  She loves it, and the trainers in the DVD actually give you tips, to have the right form when you work out.  Good purchase, definitely recommended it.",1239321600,11,336,4.6440677966101696

3704194,5,B001MZ7L7C,"I got this for my wife and she loves it. As a trainer of 15 years I can tell you that Kims workouts (designed by her trainer in the video) are fun and effective. Its also very entertaining. The real test is that my wife loves the program and thinks that it's the perfect fit for the real woman trying to get in shape.

3704195,4,B001MZ7L7C,"This is more of a cardio workout than an ab/arm workout.  Along with the aerobic warm out, you will be doing standing crunches (with or without weights) that will more work the sides than the front, then a standard arm workout of lateral lifts, bicept curls, a series of balance exercises that work the obliques, squats, then back to bicept curls.  The second act is of lawnmower rows, bentover rows, squat thrusts, mountain climbers, push ups (with or without the step to do them with), lower body leg raises, then basic floor ab work (crunches, bicycle crunches, lower abs, etc.).",1459728000,,582,4.81
3704196,5,B001MZ7L7C,"This workout is so great. I initially thought it would be kind of easy, but its not at all. The workout mostly focuses on your arms with the ab work during the arm portion being how you tighten your core during those sections. The arm workouts are tough even with really light weights. The second half is a lot of planks and push ups and stair runners. When I do this work out, I can definitely feel it the next day when I really put my all into it",1450483200,,448,4.044943820224719
3704197,5,B001MZ7L7C,"This workout was pretty simple, intermediate, and I could keep up with it, I didn't have a step, so I just used a stool, although I recommend using a sturdy stool, it worked fine for me. Now during and after I was totally fine, it was actually really fun and definitely got my heart rate up. Now, two days after doing the warmup and both exercises (but not the booty blast) my legs are killing my and my booty DEFINITELY looks bigger and totally great. Someone said their side chatter (there's not much) got you totally off track, but I am pretty easily distracted and their side chatter was just a cute little bonus, it makes it feel less like a DVD and more like a class Kim and Ken were teaching. It was super great but now every time I sit down I scream a little, but that's how you know it totally worked.",1445817600,3,810,4.232258064516129

If you've never tried it, do NOT hate on it because I can promise you that it is a GREAT workout and Kim really motivates me to work harder, not only because she's beautiful, but because she never gives up. It's fast, up-beat, intense, and fun. If you don't see any progress, it's because you need to try harder and not just go through the motions. My six pack came back after such a long time, and I thank Kim & her trainer because they kept me motivated to keep going.",1408406400,3,580,4.2342342342342345

3704215,4,B001MZ7L7C,"I enjoy the pink version of Kim's trio so I decided to give this a try.  Holy s*it, you will get worked!  I do jillian michaels 4-5x a week plus other workouts, and this one had me probably the second most sweaty I've been from an at home workout (could've wrung out my tshirt, yeah tmi gross.)  I really enjoy the instructor, Jennifer galardi, and I find her instruction to be very good.  Kims workout outfits are distracting (who wears a leather looking corset and mega push up bra to workout?!) but overall, I like Kim in these, she babbles a bit but it makes me feel as if she's more of a real woman with struggles when working out.  This DVD is very heavy on planking and wrist action in several parts, which I had to modify as I have a bad left wrist with a plate In it and I could tell I was having a hard time keeping up in those parts.  You need a step for some parts, however I tried a few without my step and it worked well.  It's surprising, this will kick your butt.  My polarft4 said I burned 600 calories in an hour. I give it 3 1/2 stars, just too much wrist action to use in heavy rotation.  Intense!",1403740800,,1117,4.087155963302752
3704216,4,B001MZ7L7C,"This is a pretty good workout.  First, let's get past the fact that it's Kim Kardashian and her annoying celebrity personality.  Does she actually do this workout in real life?  Questionable I suppose.  The workout itself is step aerobics, so it would be difficult (but not impossible) to do without a step.  If you don't have a step, you could improvise with stairs in your house.  If you don't have stairs in your house (which I don't), you could use some kind of coffee table or maybe some books stacked on the floor.  Stable books.  Otherwise this is a nice workout, and you will be sweating by the end.  The bonus section is actually quite good, you're doing some yoga bridge work and thigh work.  And it DOES work, you feel less jiggly after doing it, but it won't last forever.  The step is also used for stretching which you don't always need to use when stretching in child's pose.  I'd like to see KK do a yoga video sometime, that way she doesn't have to talk so much to the viewing audience.  Her trainer who does the workout with gives you the majority of the directions with KK saying some chatty or encouraging things.",1403481600,,1133,4.46829268292683
3704217,5,B001MZ7L7C,"If you stick with this workout, it will have you looking amazing. It can be tough, that's for sure. However, Kim is very motivating. I especially LOVE the bonus workout!",1399852800,,169,4.666666666666667
3704218,4,B001MZ7L7C,It's a good work out. Exercise TV star instructor Jennifer Galardi provides a great workout! I tried it on Exercise TV before I purchased.,1390521600,,138,4.791666666666667
3704219,4,B001MZ7L7C,This is a real work out! I am super sore every time I use this workout. Kim's trainer uses some very effective techniques to get your muscles burning! Kim is actually pleasant and charming in this video and does the modified exercises. Also the bonus is very good. If you do the DVD from start to finish I promise you will feel the burn!,1389225600,2,337,4.28125
3704220,5,B001MZ7L7C,"Good dvd, I purchased it to replace the last one I had. I think the exercises are helpful with toning.",1387584000,,102,4.15
3704221,3,B001MZ7L7C,"I would give this 3 1/2 starts if I could.  I liked it enough to finish it, but I won't do it again.

I'm not a fan of KK, but I am a fan of Jennifer Galardi, the trainer who leads KK through the workout.  I bought the DVD because of Galardi.

WORKOUT:  What surprised me is that the workout is really good, that Galardi didn't go light in creating the workout.  If you are new to exercising or are starting back, it can be a challenge. Also, Galardi shows how you can ramp it up or take it down, depending upon your fitness level.

Another surprise is that KK isn't nearly as annoying as I thought she would be.  My previous experience with celebrity workout DVDs has been that the celebrities whine and prattle.  (Kristi Yamaguchi is the exception - she's pleasant and nice.)  KK doesn't speak that much, which is a good thing.

SET:  The set is designed to look like an artist's studio in old Paris with a view of the city - it's beautiful and definitely one of the nicest sets for an indoor workout.

MUSIC:  The music is upbeat and not not too techno.

EQUIPMENT:  They use a step and light dumbbells, but you could do the workout without them.

AUDIENCE:  The ideal market for this DVD are fans of KK and hard core fans of Galardi.  Galardi is a wonderful DVD instructor.  If KK's fans aren't exercising and this gets them to try exercising, then KK has done at least one good thing with her fame.

CLOTHING:  I do think KK's outfit is over the top and distracting, but I think that's part of her shtick.

FINAL THOUGHT:  Overall, it's a very good workout DVD, but be prepared for the camera to focus on KK's face and other body parts a lot.",1386201600,4,1647,4.2727272727272725
3704222,3,B001MZ7L7C,"This is more of an upper body/arm workout than an actual ab workout.  You will do some things that involve basic crunches like you can find in any workout video for abs.  There is also a step used, but instead of step aerobics it's more used as a platform tool for doing reverse planks and dips.  Still, this is a good workout for your arms and upper body, and they should have called it just such.",1384646400,,398,4.2105263157894735
3704223,2,B001MZ7L7C,"this is a joke. I bought this to see if I could learn anything tricks and I was disappointed. It was pretty much a joke. Kim was all dolled up with lip gloss and everything. A lot of times they would zoom into her face so you could see her expressions instead of channeling how to do the workout correctly, why on earth do i need to see her expressions. please don't buy this crap. i gave this 2 starts because there was 1 mat workout that i liked out of her whole dvd. don't waste your money, you'll be buying a dvd that just zooms in on her face.",1377475200,2,548,3.9909090909090907
3704224,3,B001MZ7L7C,Amazing workout but you really have to pay close attention because there is so much talking that they get off track and jump from one exercise to the next quickly.,1371513600,,163,4.466666666666667
3704225,5,B001MZ7L7C,Didnt think this would be a good workout considering it was by Kim Kardashian. (She is a joke.) But i read the reviews and everyone was right you can definitely feel it the next day if you do the complete wokout. I still don't know how she doesnt break a sweat the whole time tho. I am not huge but not to small either like a 150 pds and I was sweating like crazy by the end of the dvd. I recommend this for people who don't like to spend hours at the gym or working out but it works your whole body in 40 mins and youcan see results.,1370995200,,534,3.8636363636363638

3704228,5,B001MZ7L7C,"I will admit, I am a Kim K stan. This workout is crazy. When I first started losing weight, this and the PCD DVD were my go to. this dvd really helped with my upper body and I went from a 40 inch waist to a 33. Its hard and I admit, I was surprised. Regardless of how you feel about Kim its a great workout. Lets be real Jennifer Galardi rarely does crap IMO.

3704229,4,B001MZ7L7C,"I love this DVD because it really is a great workout and I notice in the mirror a more bigger, fit , toned butt and legs. Definitely Kim K giving out her secrets.

3704230,4,B001MZ7L7C,"All of the negative reviews have been a little harsh on detail of the workout DVD. I personally LOVED it and i definitely see results within the first two weeks, and felt the burn. Very difficult in the beginning, advanced moves. Alot of the moves give the good burn and hurt, but that means it works. It is not only Kim working out she is right beside a certified LA trainer that knows what she's doing. I recommend this DVD 100 percent!",1360281600,,438,4.353658536585366
3704231,3,B001MZ7L7C,Some of the moves on the KK dvd were a little challenging but for the most part it was an easy workout. Not challenging enough.,1360108800,,127,4.12
3704232,3,B001MZ7L7C,"If you are really trying to fit in your jeans by Friday I wouldn't exactly call this a hefty fine workout... I think it is more relaxed and calm. It's kind of funny because you can tell Kim K has no clue what she is doing and she does it in a Bra. I'm a women and I know I don't care to see her working out in her bra. My boobs aren't the problem so I don't need any motivation there. So if you are a guy I HIGHLY recommend for you, you'll love it! Ladies, its not my favorite.",1357603200,,477,3.732673267326733

Its not an outrageous soar-ness but your abs will feel worked. It even targets  love-handles. only issue is that Kim's introduction is way to long it like "" Damn woman get to the workout"" but you can tell she really took making this DVD seriously. And she made herself very easy to relate. She give tips along the way about things she's learned that can really help you focus on the moves. And it is no secret that Kim Kardashian is not the best dancer. So it obvious that you don't need to  be extremely coordinated to do this workout. This workout is Easy, Fun, and Effective.",1355875200,,712,4.386363636363637
3704235,1,B001MZ7L7C,I wanted to like this series of workout dvds because of Kim K. but they were not challenging enough. I expected more of a burn but ended up pretty disappointed.,1352764800,,160,4.366666666666666
3704236,5,B001MZ7L7C,"""Ultimate Butt body Sculpt"" is a great workout that will make you sweat all over. The moves look deceptively easy until you are in the middle of them and just trying to catch your breath. A lot of the exercises require full-body participation. You might be working your legs and butt but you are also using hand weights and reaching above your head. I didn't have any issues with my knees or back while doing all the lunges and squats. For some reason I could do them all fairly well with a few adaptations. What I liked about this workout is how Kim gives you little tips as you go along. She helps you stay in good form while working out and stretching like a professional athlete. Jen Galardi is also excellent in this workout and keeps Kim focused on her core. Even though this workout is really challenging I felt good after I finished. If you want to work your legs and butt I can't think of a better workout. You do need a step and light weights to do the workout. I used three-pound weights. Also I think it is great that Kim wears a lot of makeup. It makes her look really cute. I look forward to doing more workouts and also loved the abs workout.

3704237,5,B001MZ7L7C,"""Amazing Abs Body Sculpt"" is a serious workout that is playful and fun. Kim Kardashian works out with trainer Jennifer Galardi who really knows how to work your body to the limit. None of the exercises were easy although Kim seemed to be able to do everything with ease.

This begins with a warm up and killer arm workout. Your arms will ache! Then there are balance challenges and fast transitions between the exercises. To keep up you really have to pay attention.

I did the exercises with three-pound weights and Kim and Jennifer looked like they were using one-pound weights. So there are ways to make this workout even more challenging. I did feel that doing the stair runners with a step made them more comfortable and enjoyable.

What makes some of this workout really hard is going from standing to doing pushups and back up again. Your heart will really be pumping and by the end of this workout you should be panting on the floor.

To me this workout felt like a full-body workout. I could feel this in my thighs, abs, butt, back and arms. What really made this workout great was the bonus workout for abs. It is more traditional but very effective.

If you are an intermediate or beginner then I can almost guarantee you are going to feel the burn. I wasn't expecting such a good workout but I'm pleasantly surprised. You will need a step, some weights and a yoga or pilates mat to do this workout well.

I have to say that all the positive reviews are not based on a bias towards Kim at all. The warm up is good and the actual workouts are amazing, my whole lower body was feeling the burn and was sweating like crazy (something that rarely ever happens to me. The cuing is a little weird and there are times where one finds Kims face being on the screen for a little too long but that does not take away from the workout, at least for me. I had thought that Kim would be annoying, but she was actually not that bad and it did feel like she was in as much pain as I was. The trainer is great and created an awesome routine. For those people saying that the workout was too easy and did not sweat, I do not know what it was you were doing wrong.

But on to more important matters...the time you spend exercising was only about 25 minutes and much easier then I thought.  I'm a normal exerciser, aged 37, in fairly good shape, nothing special.  The good part is that they give you some options to increase the intensity, but don't expect much cardio.  After neglecting exercise for about 6 months, I gave this a try for the first time yesterday and my backside and legs aren't even sore.  I have to do additional cardio separate from this video to get a good workout. Thankfully I got another DVD - New Body Fusion Workout by Cathe Frederich that is 3 times the value and twice the workout.  Wouldn't waste my money on this. Kim Kardashian should stick with what she's good at - looking pretty.",1338422400,,1167,4.545454545454546
3704247,5,B001MZ7L7C,"I love this dvd.  I am a 38 year old mother of two kids and I know the ladies know how our butts can go the other way when we neglect our bodies because we are focusing so much on everyone else.  The closer I got to 40 I wanted to change the typical ""you look good for 40"".  I wanted to look great and this dvd has done that.  If you are consistent; and that is the real key to changing your body, you will lift your behind, get rid of the inner thigh fat, and tone and tighten your entire body, not just your butt.  The dvd also works your abs, and your arms because they do use light weights and arm action all while working the lower body.  I hate to say this, but I actually think Kim is so cute in the video.  She shows you that she is a student just like you and that she has not mastered all the moves either, she also shows you how tired and winded she gets when trying to do some of the moves. I like this dvd because it is not a walk in the park, but it is not so complicated that you feel like you just joined the army.  I tried to do the insanity dvd, and it was just what it says ""insane"", you have to be in shape already to be able to handle that particular dvd, but this one is not like that, it is intense and you will feel it, but even the most out of shape person can do most of it without feeling like it is impossible.",1336348800,,1338,3.787769784172662

She has a trainer telling her what to do on the video and has alot of makeup and a corsett. not your workout material to look pretty anyhow i found it a little slow it is what i make of it. trying to stay positive with it i do get a work out and hey i can do it again and again.,1333411200,,348,3.5324675324675323
3704249,4,B001MZ7L7C,"Kim does not direct the workout herself, not by a long shot, so I had to take a star away for that alone.  Her trainer does it, and Kim is on there just working out with her as she would if they were just working out for her.  Kim doesn't always have the precise pose which makes working out to this DVD (with her) more realistic because she isn't perfect, just like her viewers.  For this reason, it was sort of motivating, especially since her curves look realistic.  She is ditzy, never really heard her talk much until then because I don't watch the show nor am I a fan, but she is my height and I am a woman with curves so I wanted to see how she got down.  I was sore for days after my first workout.  It seems so simple doing it, but it works the right muscles and does the job.  Great gig Kim is all I can say.",1332979200,,818,3.951219512195122
3704250,4,B001MZ7L7C,"After being pleasantly surprised with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kim-Kardashian-Fit-In-Your-Jeans-by-Friday-Amazing-Abs-Body-Sculpt/dp/B0021204G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kim Kardashian: Fit In Your Jeans by Friday: Amazing Abs Body Sculpt</a>&nbsp;(AABS), I was eager to try out this different workout in the series.  I definitely think that the other DVD is better, but this ""Ultimate Butt Body Sculpt"" wasn't bad at all.

Like AABS, this workout isn't actually led by Kim Kardashian; she is simply a student like you.  Jennifer Galardi leads you through the various exercises and does a very good job explaining everything.  Kim also was surprisingly helpful, inserting tips that she had learned from working on these fitness moves.  The banter back and forth between Kim and Jennifer was something I enjoyed on this DVD; it made it feel like I was really in an exercise class and not just doing exercises by myself at home.

If you've ever done a Jennifer Galardi workout before, don't expect her same method of working out in this video.  Usually, she's very dancey, toning ""lightly"" with bands or light hand weights; here, she is very athletic instead and tones by using compound moves, which I've never seen from her before.  I really enjoyed doing a different kind of workout with her; she is a fantastic instructor.

Although the title may lead you to think that this DVD is only for the glutes, that's an incorrect assumption; you will literally work nearly every lower body muscle from your calf to your thighs, and you'll even work your abs a little bit, too.  This workout is definitely not a walk in the park, but it also isn't an extreme bootcamp class that will have your legs barely able to function by the end.  It's very doable for all fitness levels, although advanced exercisers may not be incredibly sore the next morning; I'd say that this workout isn't nearly as hard as the leg work in a Jillian Michaels DVD.

The majority of the exercises are variations of lunges and squats.  Usually, there will be an upper body option (such as a shoulder press) that can include weights, if you wish to add them.  The second half of the DVD adds a step so that you will move a little bit more through each movement.

Overall, while I feel like I got a better workout from AABS, I still really enjoyed this DVD and plan to do it regularly.  I think it's a great lower body workout that is tough without making me extremely sore the next morning.  I recommend to anyone looking for a good leg workout; don't let the fact that Kim Kardashian's name is on it scare you away from trying it.  Preview clips can be found on Youtube(.)com and Totalfitnessdvds(.)com.",1326499200,,2721,5.022271714922049
3704251,4,B001MZ7L7C,"Kim Kardashian is known for filing a controversial divorce, starring in several reality shows, being the subject of a leaked X-rated video, and doing the Mambo (badly) on Dancing with the Stars.  Needless to say, I was a little bit skeptical on whether or not she could successfully produce a workout video that was more ""tough"" than ""fluff.""  I am amazed to tell you that while the DVD doesn't really focus on the abs as much as it would have you believe, it's one of the best total upper body workouts that I've ever done, and I've done a lot.

First of all, Kim is not actually your instructor for the workout; Jennifer Galardi is the trainer that will be teaching you the exercises.  Kim is more of a student or modifier that is there to show that it's not about doing everything perfectly...it's just about doing everything to the best of your ability.  Kim will wobble and falter at times which is slightly refreshing to see after doing countless workouts where the trainer doesn't even break a sweat, much less mess up.  Jennifer will always be there, as well, to show you advanced options and maintain perfect form.  If you've ever done a Jennifer Galardi workout, then you probably will be a little surprised at the difference in this workout; while she usually is all about dancing and toning without weights, she leads a more intense workout here, almost the level of a Jillian Michaels upper body workout.

The exercises included can be rough, depending on how heavy your weights are.  I was struggling with 10 pound dumbbells and had to drop down to 8 pounds, but I was still extremely sore in the morning.  This DVD is going to work nearly every upper body muscle; your back, biceps, triceps, shoulders, shoulders, chest, and core will all be bombarded with strength training.  However, my one complaint is that one of the few muscles that weren't sore in the morning was my abs.  If a DVD is going to have a muscle group in its title, then I expect to really focus on that muscle group.  It would probably be more appropriate to title this workout ""Amazing ARMS Body Sculpt.""  It is a fantastic workout for your entire upper body as a whole, but the abdominal focus just didn't seem to be there.

Some of the moves that you'll see throughout the DVD will be traditional exercises such as bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, or mountain climbers.  Others will be a bit more unique and difficult to describe.  The second half of the DVD uses a step, however, you could probably modify everything so that you do all of the step exercises on the floor.  To view video clips from this DVD, search Youtube(.)com or Totalfitnessdvds(.)com for the title of this DVD.

Overall, I loved this workout and recommend it to everyone looking for an upper body workout.  Whether you're a beginner to exercise or a seasoned pro, simply elevating or lowering the weight of dumbbells used will give you a different level of difficulty.  It's true that the abs aren't stressed as much as they could have been, but the final five minute ab workout is really good.  Don't let the Kim Kardashian label sway your opinion of this DVD; this is still an intense workout that you get to do with a celebrity who's just like you (exercise-wise anyway).",1326499200,,3232,4.633333333333334
3704252,1,B001MZ7L7C,This workout is boring and not at all hard. If you are in fair shape then you will be bored with it. Mine has ended up in the trash!!!!!,1325980800,,136,3.7241379310344827

3704254,1,B001MZ7L7C,"I love Kim as much as the next Kardashian lover but I do not love her dvd. It had a few good moves in it but it was way to fast paced. I was always at least one step behind and didn't feel like I could really get into a move before needing to be in the next one.
I suppose it could be used as a reference. You also really can't do it without a step. Which is an expensive buy for a work out video.
sorry Kim but your enthusiasm can't get you out of this one.",1318377600,,458,3.6363636363636362
3704255,2,B001MZ7L7C,Got this dvd and its hard to follow along with they do the excercises too fast. You kind of have to watch it for a while the same sections to get a hang of it.,1315785600,,159,3.5714285714285716
3704256,4,B001MZ7L7C,"I'm not exactly a fan of Kim or the Kardashian reality series but I bought this dvd because kim has a curvey, feminine body type and my body is similarly shaped and I was just looking to tone up. Not only is this a toning workout but you get your cardio in there too (in a fun way cause I hate cardio dvds). Excerises consist of lots of lunges and squats. You need a stepper and hand weights, if you think the workout is too easy for your fitness level you can always add more weight. The trainer Jennifer is good at keeping you motivated and giving advanced options for the exercises.

 Kim did a good job keeping up with the trainer and she does give you some helpful reminders on breathing and engaging your abs (something lots of people forget but it makes the difference between getting an ok workout and and getting a really good workout that you're gonna feel tomorrow). Kim definatly favors the easier exercises and stretches, as she always comments about one of the easier stretches or excerises she really likes (who doesn't like the easier stuff, I guess? Her muscles are burning as much as ours.)Yes, Kim does wear an outrageous workout outfit but its just to make a fashion statement(after all she is in the fashion industry), in my opinion it's nothing to let bother you enough that you don't enjoy the workout. Also, Kim does try to be sexy while engaging the camera, not that big of a deal if you just pay attention to your workout and concentrate on the excerise when they go over it with you. Also Kim seems to over-act a bit when one of the exercises challenges her by making it seem like she is having a terribly hard time with it. She does do the beginner exercises so if you're new to working out follow Kim. Kim didn't do a bad job, she's just not a trainer and she seems to be just someone else working out with you in the video.

The only thing I didn't like was that they did miss an exercise on the opposite leg once or twice. But not a big deal if you keep count of how many of each exercise are done then you can just do it before they transition in to the next exercise.

Both Kim and Jennifer did a good job of working you out without being too annoying, they are just motivational enough and the workout itself is something you can definatly tell will work for your whole body if you follow the trainer's insrtuctions. You do need a step and hand weights. If you're in pretty good shape then I would opt for heavier weights than those used in the video. The video is broken down into three segments and a bonus workout, I do all of them at once but I break it down if I'm pressed for time, so its also good if you are a busy person looking to squeeze a workout into your day without goin to the gym.",1314316800,3,2731,4.25626204238921

This workout is tough and you WILL feel the burn.  I had to take breaks at first because I would get so out of breath. Also, like others have said I definitely felt like it worked my arms more than my abs.  I picked this one because abs was my main area I wanted to work on, but I will still use this because it's a good workout.  Also, if you listen to the trainers instructions for pulling in your core, you can still get a good ab workout- I have trouble remembering to do that- so I think that may also be why it seems not as effective for abs.  Also, it's nice that Kim points out forgetting to breathe because I always do that too, so I need that reminder! haha. I loved it so much I am getting the other dvds and I'm not a big workout dvd person, but this kept my attention and kept me working.

3704262,4,B001MZ7L7C,"I got this DVD to try something new, but I was concerned about the effectiveness because I really don't think Kim is all that lean and fit. She is very curvy and pretty,  but not an athletic body like her trainer.

So, I popped in the DVD and gave it a whirl, thinking it may be cute and fun. However, I soon realized this is tough Sh$#t if you ignore Kim and follow the trainer - and use the heaviest weights you can handle. You have to up the weights to get better burns. Squat and lunge deeper and add intensity. Holy cow this burned and was actually a very good quality workout. My butt definitely was reshaped after a couple of months of doing this - and some other stuff.

I don't know what the other people were doing - the ones that said it was slow or they didn't sweat. Those people are either super, duper fit (and I'm pretty fit though) and need something us mere mortals can't do, or they were not working hard enough with heavy weights. You can't use the 2lb baby rattles and except that work. You have to lift heavy to see any changes. Your legs and butt are tough muscles to train and require a lot of work to exhaust.

The warm-up was nice and the workout starts targeting those legs and butt right away. I liked the room they were in with the nice rich colors and bright lighting. Kim's comments were hilarious because it seemed like she was being told what to say - and kept missing her cues and speaking over the trainer - hilarious. But, ignore that.

So, this was enjoyable to me and I love that trainer - she kind of reminded me of Laura Linney.",1301875200,5,1568,4.213333333333333

So utterly absurd to be working out in something like that. She also likes to put in her two cents once in awhile (""Remember to breathe!""), and it just doesn't work; it's out of place and it seems like she's only stepping on her trainer's toes. Cues are bad because it looks as if the trainer was told to follow the lead of Kim, and because of this, many of the steps go off beat; there's nothing worse than working out to a video when the instructor cannot keep the rhythm.

It does take a little bit to catch on to because it's filmed more like you are working out with them, rather than they are teaching you how to do the moves...and the camera focuses on Kim's face rather than the exercise sometimes. I really do like this work out, its tough and you know its working! Plus I love the Kardashians, so I found Kim really charming.

3704289,4,B001MZ7L7C,"To start off, I have lifted weights, run and worked out regularly at the gym for several years.  I bought this DVD during a very busy semester so I would have something on hand when I wasn't able to make it to the gym on time or was stuck inside due to weather.  I also wanted to learn some toning exercises specifically for the lower body. I have been using it on and off for 6 months and am very happy with the results.

The first section (no step) is my favorite part.  It consists of 15 minutes of squats and lunges variations. Because it works the lower body continually with no rest, it is surprisingly challenging and gets your heart rate up. The first few times I completed it, I was surprised how sore I was the next day--I couldn't even sit down properly the first time!  I have used the DVD less over the past few months, but when I do, I still feel noticeably 'worked out,' especially my glutes, although I have gotten much stronger.  This is one of the few exercises where I feel noticeable results focused squarely on my butt, not just my thighs, even compared to jogging on the stairmaster!  I have incorporated several of the squat variants into my gym workout by adding more weights.  Typically I will do the first section and the bonus butt blast section (5 minutes of glute and ab exercises) together when I want a great lower body workout and some mild cardio without going to the gym.

I do not like the step section as much, however, it is a good thigh workout and cardio. As other reviewers have pointed out, at times the pacing, camera angles and voice-overs are not conducive to following along.  This was also a slight problem with other parts of the tape, but it is more problematic during the fast paced step workout.

Whether you find Kim's personality charming or grating is really a matter of personal taste.  She comes across as ditzy but likable to me, and I actually prefer it to many other fitness tapes where the instructors are overly perky or aggressive.  Her trainer is more no-nonsense but still likable.  As a curvy but fit woman, it is also nice to see a body type that is not typically represented as strong and fit (even though many women are athletic AND have that body type, as I do) on a workout tape.  I also like the generally low key music and set, however the camera work is sometimes too 'low key' and not fast and workout oriented enough.

Fitness results: after adding this DVD into my workout routine at least twice a week through April and again through June, I thought my butt looked and felt significantly firmer and rounder.  The back of my thighs also look more cut and I can do more squats during a squat test.  Also, a boyfriend commented on how firm my butt is--maybe TMI but if you're considering buying the tape it might be useful information! ;)",1278892800,26,2811,4.43579766536965

I gave this 4 stars only because at one point they must have screwed up and forgot to repeat an exercise on the other leg...also the beginning warm up seems extremely rushed.  its no biggy if you don't mind pressing pause or going out of sync with the DVD itself...but other than that, this workout is challenging and definitely will work you out.",1277337600,,519,4.275510204081633

I purchased these videos because wanted to try something new (I love purchasing workout DVD's, and I figured it's Kim, she's gotta put out good quality stuff, right? If you have never lifted weights, then perhaps this video could work for you. I had to pause the video and do more reps.

The long camera shots on Kim's face are a little annoying...but she's good eye candy nonetheless. I focused more on the trainer than Kim. Kim wasn't in good form most of the time. The exercises DO work--you will feel the burn in your muscles (I feel it in my thighs!) so don't pass on this DVD just because you think Kim is a barbie.

I like to consider myself a fairly fit person who eats right most of the time but this dvd really whipped me without even getting half way through. I cant wait till ive been doing this for a few weeks to see the results but so far its the best workout dvd from my closet full of them. The only downside im seeing so far is that A) you need a step and hand weights for a lot of the dvd and B) kim and her trainer skip from one move to the next very quickly without letting you know when they're changing and what they're about to do. Think of it as attending a course that teaches a foreign language but you come in half way through the year, you might be able to get the hang of it after a while but at first you haven't got a clue whats going on.",1273190400,3,1033,3.9711538461538463

I thought this was a descent workout and I did get a good workout, my only complaint is the shots of the camera.  They are so focused on Kim's face that you miss the steps until they are on the 3rd step or so.  I wish they would have focused more on the steps, form and transition instead of showing how cute Kim is.  And before you buy any of her DVDs be sure to buy a step.

In fact, there is something rather 80s about these routines with the step aerobics.

My only complaint is that sometimes at the beginning of a workout, it could be hard to see the postions the trainer was in to do the move correctly so I did have to remind in a couple instances to make sure I was in the correct position and then do the moves with Kim & the trainer.

3704311,2,B001MZ7L7C,"I bought this on impulse. There are 2 main reasons why I dislike the DVD workout:

1. It's really not strenuous enough of a workout unless you pause the DVD and do more reps by yourself of each move

2. Kim is really annoying. She has a whiny voice, she constantly talks over and interrupts Jennifer Galardi, she makes ""kissy-faces"" at the camera, for lack of a better phrase, and it bugs me that she has her long hair down and gobs of make-up on for this ""workout.""

I purchased The Firm: Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection (4-in-1 DVD) and it was 100% better. It's fun and it includes cardio, weight training, sculpting, and stretching. It's way harder of a workout and cost about the same.

On a side note, Jennifer Galardi is really good and I would be interested in buying a DVD of hers, separate from Kim.

3704313,5,B001MZ7L7C,"I almost never write reviews, but had to pipe up for this one. I actually found it strangely soothing and pleasant even as I broke a sweat. If there's one video I *will* be able to make myself do after a stressful day, this is it. It was fun and light (i.e. no 'drill sergent' or 'punishment' vibe) and yet I still got a workout in.  I'd say this is like the ""French women don't get fat"" of workout DVDs; meaning: it might not be the most intense, and it might seem too simple at first, but it's based on actually enjoying what you're doing and feeling good about your body -- so I feel like I'm more likely to stick with it. Personally, I find positive motivation works best for me. Kim has a great body, but she looks like a real woman and clearly exercises like a real woman (i.e. not perfectly).

For background: I have never watched the Kardashians or followed them. I bought the DVD after reading reviews and wanting to try something different (that and there are few 'butt' specific dvds). I am a professional career woman trying to tone up a little more after realizing that although I am a healthy weight and a runner, nonetheless my thirties were not being kind. As someone who has few curves to begin with, I am hoping Kim's 'pro-curves' workouts keep or improve what I do have. I will update later.

I particularly like that the video wasn't 'over-stimulating' in terms of visuals and music. I actually learned a lot of improved technique because you're only watching two people interact against a fairly neutral backdrop and the trainer is correcting Kim's mistakes. The zoom in on things like Kim's lower back position was also clearer than anything I had seen in another video (I almost wonder if her curves didn't help illustrate/exaggerate when she got it right or wrong -- i.e. you can really see when she tucks her tailbone or pulls in her belly). The moves were simple, but if, like me, you're not a natural at aerobic combos, you might enjoy it. Other videos have a lot of people, a lot of complicated movement, harsh lighting and sort of 'loud' scenery and that can be just 'too much' for me. I *loved* the 'Parisian apartment' set just because it put me a relaxed mental state. It kind of reminded me of doing yoga -- i.e. things are pretty and relaxing and relatively non-confrontational, but unlike some yoga videos there didn't seem a 'perfectionist' or 'too serious' attitude. Kim's outfits were a little different, but between that and the make-up, I kind of felt like I was flipping through vogue while getting my pedicure -- it was visually interesting and I'd rather be thinking about whether I like her eyeliner than how I hate sweating so much.

Some people complain about Kim and yes she has a few vacuous (""I must not mess up my lipstick by closing my mouth!"") facial expressions and unimpressive comments, but I actually felt, to my own intense surprise, like she was a fun friend who was suffering right alongside me through the workout. She comes across as nice and real. I felt like time really flew by. Also, the 'bonus' workout seems PERFECT for someone like me who travels a lot and needs a few very very simple moves.

If you're already big into workout DVDs or are good at doing triple grapevines in aerobics or you like 'in your face' and 'no-pain, no-gain' coaching styles, this might not be for you.

Other than that, there are so many good videos out there and this is not one of them!  Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed.

3704318,3,B001MZ7L7C,"Okay. Well, I am a fan of Kim - love the show - love her and think she has a great body. However I was really disappointed with her in this DVD.

To me, it seems like she only put these DVDs together because she thought she would look cute doing them. Example 1. Her outfit is totally ridiculous in this video. Her chest is hanging out all over the place and it is almost distracting. In her bonus interview she says that fashion and fitness go hand in hand, which I agree -- however she takes this a little beyond with this crazy criss cross top and pink bra. Example 2. Kim always takes the easy way out when she is doing the moves the trainer instructs. She is not motivating, and most of the time her form is terrible. During the ""fly away"" segment on the step, her form is so loose she looks like she is trying NOT to break a sweat. Example 3. She is continually saying how the easiest moves are her favorite -- like stretching or the cool down exercises. Which is fine, but the way she says it is just straight up lazy. Basically I think Kim is simply playing a part in a role and failing at the motivational aspect. She does not practice what she preaches. Also, I don't know if it was the cutting and editing but from the opening scene Kim and the trainer also talk over each other during a lot of this video -- which is pretty annoying. It's like these people just met and have to hang out together but they really don't want to.

With all of that said, I regularly use the SELF workout DVDS but needed a change so I turned to this. I do think Kim is beautiful and it is great to see her embracing her curves but it goes down hill when she opens her mouth in this DVD. I DO feel the burn and break a sweat from this workbut but Kim's lack of effort is just off putting.

I do like the trainer. She seems to put Kim in her place a bit and I think shares some of my confusion after Kim makes her random comments/attempts to throw in her two cents. I think the next time I do this I will simply turn the sound off. So if you can put aside the fact that Kim acts like a total goodie goodie in this workout go ahead.

3704319,5,B001MZ7L7C,"I have done all three of Kim's workouts because they've been free on my cable on-demand all this month, but the ultimate butt body sculpt is my favorite. I have all three of Jillian Michael's most recent dvds (30 day shred, trouble zones, and the all cardio one) and they are tough. I do them on a regular basis and I run 3-6 miles about 4 times a week. So I consider myself fit. Kim's workout is also tough but in a different way. The movements might not be as intense as some other workouts I have done, but the repetition tires your muscles and the cardio leaves you sufficiently worked out. I was sore after doing this workout, so there were muscles that were ""woken up"" that don't normally get as much work.

There are good tips about breathing, positioning and posture while you are working out and the pace of the workout is good.

As a bonus, I like the music and the studio that they worked out it, it was a nice change from the usual exercise dvd. I recommend it for all levels of fitness.",1257206400,,999,4.28042328042328

I guess the title is kind of misleading - while there are some ab exercises, it was also just a general workout including arms, legs, etc so if you're just looking for abs I wouldn't recommend this.

I am also not a fan of the trainer, Jennifer. I'm sure she is great in her own videos, but with Kim she seemed kind of shotty. Kim would try to make comments about making sure to breathe and remember to hold in your stomach, etc. and I felt like Jennifer was less than friendly in her response.

Jennifer is a master fitness instructor who has starred in several fitness videos, including those by Crunch, Prevention, and 10-Minute Solution.  Her sweet sincerity is a perfect foil to Kim's ""I'm a celebrity"" attitude.

I'm pretty sure I've seen the trainers she works with on exerciseTV and on All-Star Workouts on FitTV. Why buy a DVD when you can get the same workout for the cost of your television provider? I recommend this for fans of Kim that want a good workout. But if you're just interested in a good workout find something else or see whats on your local listings instead of shilling out 15 dollars a pop (x3) for these DVDs.

I really enjoyed all the tips from Kim's trainer Jennifer. There are two workouts in the dvd. One is a 15 minute workout that focuses on your lower body and core. The second exericse is twenty minutes and more intense. Plenty of lower body exercises like lunges and squats. Also help with breathing and pulling in your core. The exercise are not rushed so you will have time to move on to the next one. Also a five minute booty blast bonus workout to add on that will tone your lower body.

I also think that it was an insult to true fitness women out there to not be featured on this month's muscle fitness hers and have Kim Kardashian on the cover instead. I am wondering how much she paid for that one.
She is beautiful, and because of her family background that is why she looks like she does but PLEEEASE, Kim is no fitness expert and needs to wise up when it comes to men.

But now I eat real mexican tacos, and got lazy. Honestly I was never overweight at all but now i have gained a few pounds around my stomach and butt. Its nice to have a bigger butt but who wants a flabby butt with a flabby stomach!? So I decided to buy something that was going to get me to sweat like how my body was once used to. I love that this work out incorporates pilates, boot camp work outs, and stretches. I purchased the abs and butt scupt. I really wanted to loose a couple inches fast so maybe i took it too hard the first day but i did both videos including the bonus! My sisters and i were so sore the way we used to feel when we had a trainer. But i had to slow down cause i wanted to have some consistancy and not get so worked up that i never do the work out again. Well now i do the work at least once a week and if i have time go running. Its easy because i don't do the whole entire video unless I am really REALLY up for it. The sections are short but challenging so don't over do it. I honestly don't do the work out every day because it made me loose weight really fast and I don't want to loose all of my curves but, if you have a little more cushion than you want I suggest work out hard but PACE YOURSELF. I'm sure if you do it more often than me you'll loose weight faster than I did.  -M.Garcia, 23",1244246400,6,1483,3.84640522875817

3704349,4,B001MZ7L7C,"When Kim Kardashian released her work-out series, I knew I had to buy it; first, because I'm enamored of the Kardashian family--they love fashion and work in the field (jealous), they have a Brady-Bunch family that seems very loving and they makes lots of $ and are very successful and they're all gorgeous Hollywood-ites. Plus, I'm a DVD-fitness-aholic and own and stay in shape with 100+ videos.

This DVD starts with an idle warm-up-some simple stretching and begins 2 segments of arm work with short and infrequent cardio bursts--plus, some floor core work (nothing too impressive or new) and while Kim is engaging, her attitude and demeanor with the trainer is a little sour (she might not like working-out as much as say, Renee Zellweger) but her overall energy and enthusiasm is pretty palatable. I did work up a sweat and had sore arms for a few days but the DVD seemed to lack a real tight flow--there were many moments that slowed or stalled the pace. Kim's trainer often defers to Kim which is quite funny as it's like the ghostwriter of a book deferring to the ""author"" to make a comment on the book content---the trainer should take the helm and let Kim serve as eye-candy as Kim herself admits on the DVD to having a ""limited and lazy"" approach to fitness in the past.

Comparing the DVD to Kim's wardrobe: it lacks the true spunk, originality and fierceness as her fun and fabulous frocks but remains eye-catching, charming and overall pretty decent for a celebrity fitness DVD routine (intermediate recommended).",1242086400,5,1528,4.806083650190114

I gave it 4 stars because they (Kim & her trainer) would at times quickly transition from move to move without giving the viewer the proper guidance or description on how the move should be being done.

Not a bad thing as I love to work out my arms... just saying that if you are wanting this DVD to mainly work your abdominals you will be a little disappointed as I found the ab workout section was a little lacking compared to the segment focusing on the arms.

I would not recommend this if you are a beginner to working out as it can be very tough in some parts, especially in the second workout section.

I own all 3 of the DVDs in the Fit In Your Jeans By Friday series and this one is my least favorite.  I will probably only use it for the arm-toning exercises and turn it off after that point.  In the second workout there are far too many plank moves for my taste, which I found can be a bit hard on the knees.  The other thing I noticed on this DVD compared to Kim's other 2 was that the camera seemed to focus on Kim's facial expressions and rest there sometimes and that was quite annoying when trying to learn a new exercise move and not being able to see the full body.

They all work your various muscles and you really will feel the burn... but in a good way!  I love how Jennifer & Kim discuss each time which muscle is being worked.  I find it helps me keep doing the exercise if I know exactly what I'm working for.

The setting and music is lovely.  Not overbearing at all.  The production quality is top-notch.  Also, Kim and Jennifer have a great rapport and are fun to watch and make the workout fun for anyone doing it at home.

Doing this DVD at 216 lbs. was an extreme challenge, but it felt great!

I would NOT recommend it if you are totally new to exercise. DOWNSIDES: The unnessarily long face shots of Kim are a bit annoying if you're here to exercise and not stare at Kim.  I only gave it 3 stars because neither the trainer or Kim lead you smoothly into the next exercise; they jump from one to the next before announcing the switch. Kim also tended to ""relax"" at times she should have been on top of her game. She's her usual self with the whining and ""baby talk.""  I'm not hating - I like Kim! I just have a low tolerance for a grown woman acting that way, especially if she's supposed to be ""training"" me.

All in all, I would recommend it if you're semi-fit and do not have a lot of weight to hit the floor, jump in the air, hit the floor, jump in the air...you get the point.  Great workout, fresh moves, but be forewarned.",1241308800,23,1198,4.283185840707965

The problem for me is that I am injured, and thought this would be a floor video, not primarily standing. I have a torn ACL in one leg, plantar faciitis in the other. So just be aware that this is mostly standing work. If I wasn't in pain, this would be my current HG video. As it is being mostly standing I had to improvise or skip parts.

I may have to do it a couple more times to get it well. I do say, I felt the burn. Kim is really cute in this video and I was surprised that I found her so charming. So if you really want a good workout that helps you define curves, I would recommend this. All your feelings about Kim set aside, and get ready for some working out.",1240099200,80,674,3.8214285714285716
