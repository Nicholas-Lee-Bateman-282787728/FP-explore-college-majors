8502369,1,B006OT0SWQ,"Well, this has to be my biggest disappointment of the year, so far. I was waiting, and hoping that I would get this DVD to review. Today in the mail, my prayers were answered. I couldn't wait to pop this into the DVD player. A film called Woodstock Days. All I could imagine were outtake performances from the original concert, or at the very least, footage that had been cut from the original film. I loved the original Woodstock film and concert, and even though I was only two when it happened, I should have grown up during the era. My excitement was growing as I ripped open the envelope containing the DVD. There on the front cover was the iconic Woodstock crowd and a peace symbol, and on the back... why is Alice coopers' ""School's Out"" listed on the back? Why is Ringo Starr's All Starr Band listed on the back? RIPOFF!! Yes folks, XXL Media Entertainment has done it once again. They've mislead the buyer with hopes of one thing, then given them a collection of videos that could have come from your dad's VHS collection. Yes, most of these artists were popular during, or around the time of Woodstock, but that gives them no right to give this DVD that title and that cover. I was so depressed I actually had a sick feeling at the pit of my stomach, and I didn't even have to pay for this copy, as it's for review. So let's get on with the track-listing and the quality.

1. Procol Harum - A Whiter Shade Of Pale; Beginning and end of the song are cut off. The video is decent quality.

2. Alice Cooper - School's Out; Decent quality audio and video.

3. The Doors - Five To One (It's actually Spanish Caravan, good job listing the titles). - Black and White recorded live and not mimed. Decent quality.

4. Melanie - Brand New Key; Live performance, looks like MTV unplugged in the 70's.

5. Janis Joplin - Piece Of My Heart; Black and White. Beginning is cut off, decent quality.

6. The All Starr Band - The Weight; (It should be Ringo Starr and The All Starr Band featuring Levon Helm) - This version is actually from the 80's. Good quality sound and video.

7. Ike And Tina Turner - River Deep, Mountain High; Live Performance. Audio quality is a bit poor, and the song is cut off at the end.

8. Blood Sweat and The Tears - Inner Crises (Should be Blood, Sweat and Tears) - Live in the studio performance.

9. Black Sabbath - Paranoid; Black and White version of the video that MTV used to play on Closet Classics back in the 80's.

10. Leon Russell - Delta Lady; Video has some annoying digital artifacts, and the end is cut off.

11. Simon and Garfunkel - Mrs. Robinson; Live performance. Audio and video are quite poor and the last third of the song is missing.

12. Lovin' Spoonful - Daydream; Black and White, video quality is a bit rough. Live mimed performance.

13. Aretha Franklin - Respect; Black and White promotional video with some audio problems.

14. Johnny Winter - Stranger Blues; Live performance. Video quality is quite poor.

15. Cream - Crossroads; Live performance with terrible audio and video.

16. Grateful Dead - Playing in The Band; Live performance from the 80's. This is the best clip on the DVD, even though the last half of it is missing.

17. Creedence Clearwater Revival - Bad Moon Rising; Live performance. Poor quality audio and video.

A truly unremarkable release. The company who creates these disasters should be ashamed of themselves for taking someone's hard earned cash. It's a good thing most consumers are smart, and labels like this won't last long. Buyer beware. 0/10.",1372032000,4,3531,4.516483516483516
8502370,1,B006OT0SWQ,"This dvd implies that it contains music and performances from the original Woodstock festival in 1969. As it turns out, there are no performances from Woodstock on this disc at all. instead, there is a hodge podge of very poor quality film clips from various sources, none of them having anything to do with Woodstock at all. I feel this was a complete waste of money, and really isn't worth the price at all. Amazon should be made aware of these items, so customers will not be taken advantage of in the future. I am very disappointed.",1336521600,8,536,4.536082474226804
