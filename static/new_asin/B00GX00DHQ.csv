6123056,4,B00GX00DHQ,"Yes, I enojoy the DVD; however The Tribute to the Cathedrials is better, I think.  I am sure that not everyone agrees with me, but this is my turn, right?

As for the newer base singer, he sounds very good with the group.

I think it is a good production.",1397865600,,255,4.06

6123060,5,B00GX00DHQ,I am not good with change and I was pretty sure to not like EHSS without Ryan and Tim. But............. that new bass is absolutely amazing. The performances seemed sincere and fun. And the lead did an amazing performance on 'Noah Found Grace'. 'Glorious Day' the remake of 'One Day' is EXCELLENT. This may be the best yet!,1394236800,,323,4.586206896551724

8628209,5,B00GX00DHQ,"This DVD is done with excellence and class as fans have to expect from EH & SS.  Through personnel changes this group remains true to their Southern Gospel roots.  New releases are consistently strong musically as well has entertaining.  If you like Male Quartet harmonies Signature Sound is among the very best in the business today.
