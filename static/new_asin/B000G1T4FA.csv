8128648,5,B000G1T4FA,I am an environmental sociology teacher and I bought this to use in class.  It is well worth it for educational purposes and for just being informed.  Well Done.,1391644800,,161,4.517241379310345
8128649,5,B000G1T4FA,"I loved the name of this movie, but naturally had low expectations as it was quite hard to find; only Amazon really carried it. This work of art should be on all streaming services. Naturally, as one can discern from the cover, there is a perspective here that Couturie wishes to express. He does so through one of the most visually and rhetorically compelling narratives I have seen in a while. He presents the words and worlds of those who came before us in an effort to help We, The People of Earth, contextualize our current precipice. Couturie does this very evenhandedly, allowing viewers to come to their own conclusions. It is hard not to come to what is no longer HIS perspective: that we are tiny parts of an infinite Universe and we must act as stewards and not dominators of this place we call home. We must see our economy as a subset of the ecosystem and stop treating the ecosystem as an endless pantry and bottomless toilet (my scatological metaphor). As we continue to de-legitimate and commit acts of cultural genocide on native peoples, we must remember that the ancient knowledge they possess may be the very key to our survival.",1389484800,3,1149,4.637254901960785
8128650,5,B000G1T4FA,"This documentary takes the viewer through an in-depth look at the American Dream: from the earliest immigrants to the United States up until the present. Rather than traditional documentary narration, the movie uses quotes from  the well-known people of each era throughout history to illustrate the values of the American Dream. The documentary very effectively shows how the ""dream"" has evolved and changed, and what caused those changes. The best feature of this documentary is that it brilliantly illustrates the immense cost of the relentless pursuit of the American Dream: in terms of the environmental cost and the negative effects on individual people, groups and society as a whole. Would definitely recommend this documentary!",1352851200,4,736,5.456140350877193

8128652,5,B000G1T4FA,"A crisp, vibrant historic overview of our very own America.  With an environmental-based tone, the feature covers a lot of ground.  An all-star cast provides narration and the director maintains an ""arty"" feel as he masterfully uses historic footage and first rate cinematography to tell his (and our) story.  Highly recommended.",1169164800,8,329,5.411764705882353
