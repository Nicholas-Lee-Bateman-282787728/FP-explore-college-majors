8155958,3,B000KF0DT8,"I suppose I was hoping for more danger, like in ""Hot Rods To Hell,"" or teenage angst, as in ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" but on a sub-B movie level of course, so I was a little disappointed. But, as with other St. Clair Vision collections I've purchased before, I got a whole bunch of movies, of varying quality, for a very reasonable price.  This collection doesn't include any greats, but some of these movies have stories that deserved bigger budgets than they got, making them fairly enjoyable to watch.  The rest are interesting curiosities of the ""B"" teen flick genre of the 50's and early 60's.  If you're up for this kind of thing, buy it used.  You can hardly go wrong if you pay less than a dollar per film.  I won't name my favorites, because people who like these kinds of films like them for different reasons, but I will tell you that ""Jail Bait"" has nothing to do with underage sex.",1280966400,,893,4.420731707317073

8155960,3,B000KF0DT8,"This is an impressive collection of public domain 50s movies that fall into the Juvenile Delinquent genre: that is, low-budget drive-in pictures exploiting the post-Rock 'n' Roll teenage culture of the time. I love this stuff, so I was happy to pick up this 3-DVD package for a cheap price.
One complaint: 2 of the movies don't belong on this collection at all. JAIL BAIT is Ed Wood's early 50s attempt at Film Noir, and has about as much to do with this genre as Gone With The Wind. THE GIRL IN LOVER'S LANE is more of a traditional melodrama, and also really doesn't belong here. St. Clair should have gone with  movies that better fit the collection's theme, or shortened the running-time and lowered the price.
All in all, though, it's worth picking up if you're a fan of all things ""J.D."" related...let's hope there's more budget movie boxes with this theme coming out!",1216857600,4,874,4.638709677419355
