My son turned me on to Lucio Fulci a couple of years ago. I've loved his films ever since and I would put him on the same level as George Romero. The production values are not at the current level so that may disappoint some viewers. I wasn't bothered. Watch the film with a glass of a good Chianti, sit back, and enjoy.",1434672000,4,366,4.154929577464789

These are the full movies, each on their own disc and in such great quality given how old the movies are.  This is a nice way to get to know New York Ripper as most Fulci fans would buy this collection for House by the Cemetery or City of the Living Dead.  All 3 masterpiece movies are in this great set for a fantastic price!",1434240000,3,483,4.1063829787234045
6899090,5,B00R55U120,"The quality of the transfer of the movies is excellent!  I was glad to get a set with two of the three ""gates of hell"" movies in it, but it would have been ideal if Blue Underground had the rights to ""The Beyond,"" as a set with all three of the trilogy movies together would have been amazing.  I would have preferred that this set was just the two ""gates"" movies, as ""The New York Ripper"" makes no sense in the set.

With this said, the price is great, the transfer is great, and I have no complaints!

Be sure to pick up the new Grindhouse release of ""The Beyond"" as well:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q5KG5BW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_140

You really can't go wrong you get 3 Uncut Horror Films by one of the BEST Italian Directors ever............
Without a doubt the weakest Film in this set is House by the  Cemetery  (Never could get into House by the Cemetery I can Respect it as a strong unique haunted house style film but, it still hasn't blown me away)

I wish Blu Underground was able to get the rights to The  Beyond then they could've made a Gates of Hell trilogy Set
(NY Ripper is Awesome but, it doesn't feel right in this set)
None the less this 3 disc Set is flat out 5 Star you get every film Uncut plus all the extras that were on the Individual Blu Ray's
the Price point of $19.99 makes this a Real Must Have
If you are now discovering Lucio Fulci you can't go wrong this set is a testament to a Director/writer who was ahead of his time and really Fearless

A Must have if you don't have the Single Stand Alone Blu Ray's already  9.8/10
P.S. Buyers beware these Films are extreme and without a doubt Rated X not for children (If you have a 12 year old who watches the walking dead this is Not aimed at them it's very much Adults Only! But, what do i know i know nothing!",1439856000,6,1239,4.1203319502074685

8694149,4,B00R55U120,"This collection doesnt really add anything new to the available Lucio Fulci catalog. It merely combines three previous Blue Underground releases into one set.

Despite weirdly only containing 2/3 of Fulcis Gates of Hell trilogy and having the ultra sleazy and sadistic giallo New York Ripper in place of The Beyond, this is still worthy of purchase, provided you didn't get these movies as individual discs.

While City of the Living Dead and the slightly more subdued House by the Cemetery represent the best that Italian low budget horror films of the 1980s have to offer, New York Ripper is a tough one to watch. Because its likely that fewer people  have actually watched Ripper, and even fewer have claimed it has any merit, its the one Id like to focus on.

On the surface New York Ripper would seem to be senseless torture porn under veneer of pointless sleaze, but in reality its a pretty decent giallo. This film represents a pretty stark U-turn for Fulci from the surreal and supernatural horrors of City of the Living Dead or The Beyond to realistically representing the sleaziest side of life in urban America. Its not for everyone, nor is it of the same quality as the other two films. It is, however, a very well made bad movie.

If you have the stomach for the misogynistic violence, sleaze and gore, New York Ripper is actually no more unsettling or disturbing than the Hostel or Saw series. At the current price of $25 for this set, the inclusion of it should not be a deal breaker. Ideally this set should have included The Beyond, but apparently Blue Underground didn't own the rights.

8694154,3,B00R55U120,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Lucio Fulci release in 2016. At the time of this review the cost of the collection was $39.99.

This collection is for fans of cult horror and low budget horror. There are plenty of extra's and it is a good for release for the intended audience. I am not necessarily the intended audience and my rating is reflected this way. Most of the people buying these movies will be fans of the director.

BLU-RAY & EXTRA'S: The picture is OK...nothing stunning.  Probably the original prints or negatives weren't all that great to begin with. Fulci probably wasn't working with the best film equipment to begin with being that these are low budget movies.  There isn't anything wrong that is glaring. Still...this is certainly the best available prints for these movies. The picture of The New York Ripper appeared to be sharper than the other two prints.

There are plenty of extra's. They are:

-Trailers for all 3 movies
-Interviews with actresses and actors from two of the movies
-There is a documentary on the making of 'City of the Living Dead'
-There are comments from a lot of the people working on 'City of the Living Dead' about their experiences with Lucio Fulci
-Radio Spots/Still Galleries
-There is a then and now featurette on the locations of 'The New York Ripper.'
-There is one deleted scene for 'The House by the Cemetery.'
-Subtitles for all movies

PLOT/SUMMARY: CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD:

A medium in New York City, Mary Woodhouse, has a vision of a priest hanging himself in a cemetery. Mary dies after this vision. A reporter, Peter Bell, shows up to the funeral. After the funeral is over, he hear's Mary pounding on the coffin. He uses a pick axe to free her and almost kills her for real in the process. Peter and Mary learn that due to Father Thomas killing himself, a door has been opened that the living dead can enter on All Saints Day which is two days away. They head for Dunwich.

Somehow the town beauty, Emily, decides to help or possibly date, Bob, the village idiot who has a past history of being a sexual deviant. She is killed in the shop where Bob works. A teen couple ends up being slaughtered while fooling around in their car. Naturally Bob is blamed.

I won't bother with any more plot details from here. Let's just say, lots of living dead and lots of killing and lots of guts. The living dead have begun their attack on humanity. Expect to see lots of fog, lots of vomit and lots of worms and maggots. Can the portal be closed? You will have to watch to find out. Just don't hold your breath waiting....

THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY: The movie opens with a a girl in a derelict house. She has gone there to meet her boyfriend. She finds her
boyfriend has been murdered and she is murdered within seconds of her discovery.

The Boyles are leaving New York City to go to a New England town. Bob sees an image of a girl in a picture hanging on their apartment wall. He tells him Mom that the girl is telling him not to leave. His Mom looks at the picture and the girl is not there. She obviously believes he is imagining things. They are going to the house of Dr. Peterson. Dr. Peterson murdered his girlfriend and committed suicide. When they get to Boston, the Boyles go into a realtor's office to collect the keys and Bob hears Mae tells him to go away. One of the realtor's calls the house, the Freudstein house while the other insists on 'Oak Mansion.' Mae, standing by a store window, sees a mannequin beheaded and blood flowing from the neck. Shortly we will find out that the mannequin is in the image of Ann, the new housekeeper and babysitter for Bob. They house is in poor shape and the cellar door has been nailed and locked shut. One evening Ann attempts to unlock the basement. Mae tells Bob that Mary Freudstein is not buried in her grave out in the cemetery.

Dr. Boyle goes the library where Dr. Peterson worked where he finds a helpful librarian and his assistant. They tell him that Dr. Peterson hung himself from a library bannister and they give him all his materials. The librarian also insists that he has met Dr. Boyle and his daughter but he tells him he is obviously mistaken. Dr. Peterson had been studying disappearances in the area.

Ms. Boyle discovers a tombstone beneath a rug in the house. Dr. Boyle says this is normal for old houses as they had no way of burying people in the winter. Dr. Boyle opens the basement and along with his family gets attacked by a bat. He kills the bat after much effort. While at the hospital the realtor comes to the house to let the Boyle's know she has found another place for them to stay. She walks on the tombstone and it opens up and she badly injures her leg. From below an unknown figure grabs her and murders her.

Mrs. Boyle finds Ann cleaning a bloodstain on the floor in the kitchen but Ann hides it from her. Mr. Boyle learns about Freudstein's illegal experiments and needs to do more research. He discovers a casette tape made by Dr. Peterson that tells why Freudstein killed his family.

Back at the house, Ann hears Bob crying and goes to look for him in the basement. She is murdered there. Bob tells him Mom that Ann has been killed in the basement but she doesn't believe him. Bob goes to the basement looking for Ann and he gets trapped. Ms. Boyle hears his cries and attempts to get him out. Mr. Boyle comes home just in time and uses a hatchet to open the door. Dr. Freudstein is in the basement and Mr. Boyle cuts his hand off which is holding Bob. Freudstein retreats into the basement. Mr. Boyle tells Mrs. Boyle that Freudstein uses his victims to regenerate his flesh. Freudstein kills the Boyles and then goes after Bob. Bob is saved when he is pulled through the tombstone to the upstairs. A woman, apparently, Mrs. Freudstein saves him and Mae is there also. She takes them away....to where?... is anybodies guess....

THE NEW YORK RIPPER: The movie opens with a guy playing with his dog in New York City by a bridge. His dog goes to fetch a stick and comes out with a hand. It turns out that this is the hand of a murdered model. Lt. Fred Williams is the police officer in charge of solving the crime. He learns that the perpetrator makes a quacking noise like a duck. Next, a woman is murdered on a the Staten Island Ferry. We hear a quacking voice but don't see the killer.

The police alert the media that a serial killer is on the prowl and Lt. Williams seeks out the help of a psychologist named Dr. Paul Davis. More murders occur. The police get a tip from a girl that survives an attack. She says the killer is missing two fingers. We find out that the three fingered man is a gigolo. One night while servicing a customer he makes a mysterious phone call which leads us to believe he has a co-conspirator. The gigolo goes on the run and is found dead. One of the victims was found dead after his death so they now know that there is someone else doing the killing. The serial killer plays cat and mouse with Lt. Williams.

PRODUCTION/COMMENTS:From the extra's, you learn that Fulci wasn't the easiest guy to work with. Most of the people working with him said that he yelled and cursed at the crew constantly. He even yelled at the child actors and smacked one of them. Despite this most of the people involved said they loved working with him. I guess he was just one of those guys. The type that rant and rave an nobody really takes seriously because they just don't really come across as any angry person.

Fulci, makes cameo appearances in each of these films ala Alfred Hitchcock.

Since Fulci was using a lot of foreign actors and all the movies are set in the United States, many of the actors are dubbed and sometimes obviously so. I don't mind dubbing when it does for foreign movies but when using European actors it doesn't look very good, at least in my opinion.

'City of the Living Dead' is also known as 'The Gates of Hell.'

The village of Dunwich is referred to as both a village and a county. It's hard to imagine a county that would have only one road in. I think the obvious reference is to 'The Dunwich Horror' by Lovecraft. Both are located in New England.

The reporter, Peter Bell, nearly kills Mary for good while in the coffin. What on earth was he doing driving the pick axe in the middle of the coffin. Why didn't he just pry it open?

This movie is notable for a scene in which real maggots are extensively used. The actor's and actresses actually had to do the scenes with maggots crawling all over them. It's rice that is being blown through the window but the maggots all over the floor and on their bodies that are very real. You see them all moving. No CGI back then!

This movie is part of a trilogy, the second movie, 'Beyond' is not in this collection but the third is. That one is 'The House by the Cemetery.'

THE CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD: This is not a good movie. In the extra's one of the actors says as much. He said the point was to scare you, not have a sensible plot. Due to how fake everything looks, it's not all that scary. I forgive poor effects if the plot is decent but in this case the plot is just terrible.

I have never seen so much use of fog, worms and maggots in my life! It is everywhere along with fake vomit!

The barkeeper seems to be not all that disturbed about his bar going to pieces. He incredibly just makes a joke about poor construction! This after a mirror smashes and a wall cracks open with such severe force that you would have thought a large earthquake had hit and ripped it apart.

THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY: This movie started out well enough but by the end it turned into a barely coherent mess just like 'City of the Living Dead.'

Did anybody bother to look around the basement while they were there? We see them go into the basement several times but nobody ever thinks to look around.

This movie is simply a logical mess. Nodody acts realistically in the face of the horrors.

The editing is poor. For instance, when Ann walks into the house...from the point of view of Mrs. Boyle, they show a flashback to Ann's mannequin being beheaded yet it was Mae who witnessed this. They should have done this scene from Mae's point of view. I've commented elsewhere about how poorly the score is edited.
Also, we constantly hear a baby crying and yet even though many people hear it, nobody ever seems to think it's odd or even creepy. They just sort of shrug their soldiers as if they are hearing things or it's the wind.

I believe there must have been script changes in the middle of the movie. The ending seemed very rushed, as if they ran out of money and it was time to end the movie.
Some examples....
-When Mae see the mannequin beheaded early on with the face of Ann, I thought for sure this meant that Ann was some sort of ghost. She shows up acting very strangely. Her behavior is extremely inconsistent along with some of the others. I thought for sure that she was the ghost of the girlfriend that was murdered by the previous owner. The movie even sets it up that way. You see Dr. Boyle give her a look in the kitchen when his wife is there and it appears that he is interested. At times she seems distant and doesn't talk and other times she is friendly. Ann doesn't seem to serve any other purpose.
-Ann also seems to be attracted to the basement and even tries to unlock it. Later on she secretly tries to cover up a bloodstain in the kitchen after the realtor is killed. She seems to be protecting whoever is in the basement yet later on when in the basement she is surprised by the killer and murdered. She acts as if she had no clue something was going on down there.
-The realtor that sends Ann to the house behaves strangely and then she doesn't. She seems to ignore the Boyle's while in the street and then she
comes by later as if nothing is wrong.
-Dr. Boyle learns that the previous owner hanged himself on a railing in the library where he is working. Several times he is seen looking at the railing with sinister music playing. You think for sure that somebody is going to end up hanging there. Again this is just a dead end or red herring.
-The librarian insists that Dr. Boyle has visited and came with his daughter. Dr. Boyle tells him he is mistaken and that he has a son. Once again this subplot goes nowhere and is not mentioned again.

The score was terrible. Not so much the actual music. It seems like the Fulci didn't know when to start and stop the music. Just watch the last half hour and you will know what I mean. Sometimes it seems like the horrific scenes are over and the music stops but then the horror starts up again and he forgets to turn on the music...and vice versa.

I don't like to complain too much about dubbing but I have to in the case of Bob. The dubbing for the kid was just horrendous. I cringed every time I heard his voice.
I also thought 'Bob' was a terrible name for the kid. He looks nothing like a 'Bob!' He looks more like a Hans or a Lars or something Scandinavian.

I thought the seen with the bat attacking the Boyle's looked terrible. It was illogical and over the top. I have never seen a bat attack with such ferocity in any movie! It looked as fake as can be too! I have no idea what purpose this served nor how a bat was alive in a sealed basement.

How does that cellar door lock itself anyway. What does Freudstein's need for blood have to do with telekenetic abilities? If that's what's going on or is the house alive?

THE NEW YORK RIPPER: To me, this was easily the best of the 3 movies. This one at least had a coherent plot. It is basically a serial killer murder mystery.

There is far more nudity in this movie than the other two. It also has some pretty explicit sex scenes. I don't know what the rating was but it had to be either NR or X rated. There are some scenes that are definitely not for the faint hearted. One in particular depicts a girl being sliced up by a razor. So be warned.

I wasn't entirely thrilled with the ending but at least it made some sense.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I cannot recommend this collection to anybody other than fans of cult horror and horror fanatics. These movies are a logical mess. There is no reason for movies with plots as simple as the ones here to be so difficult to follow or figure out. The exception is 'The New York Ripper.'

Most of the reviews for these movies are coming from fans of these movies, thus the very high ratings.

I am not trying to insult fans of these movies. I understand that there are other reasons to like movies other than sensible plots. This is just not my cup of tea. My reasons are given above.

I have read some online reviews of movies by Fulci including those in this collection and some reviewers consider his films true art and believe him
to be a superior director. Basically, like many cult films, opinions on these movies will be polarizing.

I'm giving the collection 3 stars. The presentation is 5 stars. You get a lot of extra's and you get 3 movies with Blu-ray quality. The movies themselves are 1 to 1 1/2 stars for an average of 3 to 3 1/2 stars. I suppose I could give it 4 stars but I disliked the movies so much that I don't want to.

For fans of crazy non-sensical old low budget horror this is a five star collection. If you are just an average horror fan it is much lower.",1516060800,2,15305,4.3427871148459385
