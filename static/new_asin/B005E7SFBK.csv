8468046,4,B005E7SFBK,"John Payne looks bad with a mustache and Ruth Roman looks a little fat, but the film is ok. It is about a father and mother, John and Ruth, who want revenge after their only son is accidentally killed by ex-confederate soldiers. The boy went behind one of the, a member of a family of confederate soldiers, and in fun, while the man's back was turned, shot at him with a cap pistol. He turned in fear and shot and killed the boy. The boy's father was not only enraged by the shooting of his son. He had been a major in the Union Army and hated the Rebs.",1513123200,2,553,4.08256880733945
8468047,4,B005E7SFBK,"The transfer to DVDR is decent and the story is okay. Although John Payne's name is the most prominent in the billing, I found Ben Cooper's character to be the most convincing.

Unfortunately, I have to withhold one star for the absence of what I consider obligatory information on the back of the packaging, namely, the release date of the film, the run time, and the aspect ratio. This is inexcusable, especially considering what is being charged for the DVDR. I later found the film's release date in an unexpected location: on the disk itself.

However, I need to direct attention to one thing that may be of concern to film buffs:
the film is in full-frame format. I would have expected that this film, released in 1956, to be in a widescreen format. So I checked the IMDb, which, surprisingly, listed 2 aspect ratios for the film:  1.85 : 1  and  1.37 : 1. In my personal opinion, the full-frame format is quite adequate for this film.",1509926400,,941,4.5773809523809526

8468052,4,B005E7SFBK,This western was better than I expected. The story was good and the principal actors did a good job. It is a rather grim story and makes good points about revenge and forgiveness. Ruth Roman has a good role which is really an integral part of the story. It is one of those small scale westerns of 50's which sometimes were really good. Even Kermit Maynard is included among the actors!,1335484800,7,385,4.436619718309859
8468053,5,B005E7SFBK,"REBEL IN TOWN is a solid, entertaining, if unpretentious, little Western, with a cast headed by the underappreciated John Payne (who is generally not that well known for his Westerns, although he made some good ones--e.g., SILVER LODE and TENNESSEE'S PARTNER) and Ruth Roman. The story is a simple one, but is handled deftly. A young Ben Cooper, member of a family of Confederates who have not yet surrendered, is accused of shooting Payne and Roman's young son. There is decent character development and a surprize denouement. The supporting cast, including J. Carroll Naish and John Smith, add lustre. The black and white print is crisp--too bad the film wasn't shot in color. Recommended.",1327190400,6,691,5.0701754385964914
