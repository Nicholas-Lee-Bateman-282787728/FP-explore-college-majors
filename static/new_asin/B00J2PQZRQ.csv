6317357,4,B00J2PQZRQ,"If it were not for the excessively long scenes at the stock exchange, I would call this a perfect film.
I do prefer his later films, The Passenger and Blow Up, but this my favorite of Antonioni's ""loneliness""
trilogy.
The ending sequence is one of those great moments in film history, pure cinema, and it's never been equaled.

This Criterion Blu Ray is outstanding, and a vast improvement over previous editions.
The picture quality is excellent, with great black level and contrast. It's worth every penny.

I have not seen the extra's yet, I was more focused on having a pristine copy of the film, and I don't think
one can improve on this.

Service and delivery was fast, thank again Amazon.",1407542400,9,695,4.680327868852459
6317358,5,B00J2PQZRQ,"Michelangelo Antonioni is a filmmaker that I have a great fondness for. I think that he achieves a great deal within the parameters of the medium and often elevates it to it's most pristine heights. Sadly, I do seem to have a fair bit of difficulty convincing the people that I know of this. There is a special key to unlocking an Antonioni film but once you do there is no going back. His films have a language all their own and it can be very difficult at first to understand his musings and imagery. But it's a lot more simple than most people think. Antonioni is a very literal filmmaker, meaning he does not depict metaphors but rather he literally depicts the meaning of one. Take his 1962 film L'Eclisse for example, the film opens with the opening titles streaming over a bit of manic and jovial music, which without warning changes into an ominous and haunting score. What that means is that there are literally two different tales being spun here, two completely different approaches and meanings. Tones and moods. Two characters, two lives. A spectrum of emotion. He did not communicate that within the boundaries of a metaphor, he literally exposed it. Then Antonioni fixes on an obviously disheveled and troubled middle aged man, leaning over a stack of books, with a small fan blowing on his back. He appears like a man stranded on the rocks of the ocean, the wind on his back. Then we are first introduced to Vittoria, as played by Antonioni's muse Monica Vitti, and as she walks across the pristine tile we are privy to her reflection bouncing off of it. We are shown reflections several times during this first scene. These are not metaphorical, we are literally seeing reflections of people. Ghosts, imprints, what-have-you, the meaning is literally exposed in the center of the room. You don't have to look very hard to find a great deal of meaning in an Antonioni picture.

That said, let's focus a little bit more on the incredible L'Eclisse. It is an astonishing film, amazing, brilliant, and wise. It's alive. For Antonioni, this film is quite lively. It stars Monica Vitti as the wandering and troubled Vittoria and Alain Delon as the determined yet equally troubled Piero. The chemistry is out of this world, easily my favorite on-screen romance.

Let's explore the themes of L'Eclisse. L'Eclisse, to me, is about that last sliver of soul. It seems to be a film inhabited by an array of nearly empty characters, but something inside of them still yearns for something. Through the everyday havoc and monotony, that last sliver slowly diminishes. Or it burns brighter. Sometimes I even like to view Piero as some sort of spiritual guide to the nearly-empty. An oracle, a symbol of routine chaos and anachronistic order. A contradiction. A practical joke on humanity and love and everything we try to define ourselves with. He jokingly calls himself a call girl. That is a very accurate observation on his part. He is an easy release. He attempts to find freedom within his dream come true. He attempts to not be so empty.

Vittoria can be viewed as exactly what she is, the troubled translator. She can be seen operating as Piero's spiritual medium as she attempts to actually communicate very real emotions to him. Being mostly uninvolved in Piero's perception of the world, his daily life, she must appear to him something frail from a dream. Like a cloud he's passing through. She is so airy and whimsical that Piero must feel as if he is in some sort of fairytale with her out on some infinity road. ""It's just always been there."" They discover that what they do, however seemingly infinitesimal it might seem to them, actually leave traces on the world. That love matters and the planet recognizes it's existence. They were here and when they were here they felt a certain way about a certain person and they were scared and happy and relentless. They also learn that even emotions fit on a grid, like a blueprint. Even emotions can be pinned down and recycled. But the traces of it remain.

Vittoria tells Piero that ""Two people shouldn't know each other too well if they want to fall in love.""

Piero feels like a tourist in a foreign country. Vittoria feels like a perpetual bridesmaid. And if they got to know each other well enough, maybe they wouldn't want to share this emotion that they had been craving. That thing that makes them feel a little less empty, less than air. Should a person know more about his/ her lover other than that there is love there? Is love that fragile? Does it fall apart when donned, does it cower when analyzed? Of course it does. It is an emotion that's not easy to come by, one must treasure it's very existence and be happy that they were able to experience it at all. Love comes and love goes. But it leaves traces. Slivers of it everywhere. And those kisses that always felt too short really were.

In L'Eclisse, Piero learns how to live with the life he carved out for himself. He learns how to let it scream. He learns that it is not his responsibility to answer the call of the wounded and the nearly empty. He puts the world on hold, for how long we'll never know. He learns how to live with the commotion. The screams. And not take part in the frenzy of it.

Vittoria learns how to live in a silent world with blank features. She learns that sound does not define activity. She learns that traces of herself abound. She learns that a new ensemble will arrive with all of their own unique fingerprints to leave on the world and that they share it and they share these same feelings too. She finds a way to get lost, mistaken. And not feel eclipsed by the oncoming rush of infinity.

And we learn that our lives are made up of a ""fragile peace."" That we are all but flesh and bone and blood. But we are also ideas, shifting ones, fragmented slivers that make up an emotion not yet classified. We are the subversive material, the cobblestone quakes because we make it quake. We are inherently fractured glimpses of things we used to feel. We are the traces of everything we have ever felt. You can see the love I had on my face, my doubts and depression and memory. These are the things that make up the lines on my face.

L'Eclisse is best when documenting the instance of bliss. I never thought I'd smile so much during a scene directed by Antonioni but I just couldn't stop. The instance of bliss is infectious. Spontaneous love is infectious. And it's real. There is evidence of it's existence. We were here and we were in love and we were hurt but we're not right now.

L'Eclisse is just a pitch perfect film.",1405468800,27,6586,4.578456318914334
6317359,3,B00J2PQZRQ,"This is a strange film filled with static B&W shots that are beautiful but not emotionally involving. The main characters played by Delain and Viti are handsome but not appealing or engaging. I really prefer more narrative in a film and did like Antonioni's ""The Passenger"" and ""Blow-up""  much more.",1402963200,7,299,4.98
6317360,5,B00J2PQZRQ,"I found this film amazing. Beneath the hedonism and consumerism of modern Italian life there is an austerity of vision and a movement towards abstraction. This is Antonioni at his peak,the black and white period. Monica Vitti has never been better in her exploring the traces of the aftermath of love when she hooks up with the impulsive Delon character.the framing of the shots, the beauty of the cinematography,the use of architecture,the movement from activity to stasis and the marvellous silent ten minute ending,suggestive of apocalypse. Superb end to a great trilogy of films(see).In a world of chaos we have geometry,whether of architecture or of framing a shot,In a world without a relationship to past or present,narrative or nature,we get an immense visual stylisation. There is no story,but a visual metaphor for alienation and silence. Words drain out of the film into an empty barrel,leaving beauty and terror.",1402358400,26,924,5.25

8647515,4,B00J2PQZRQ,"It may well be my failing, but I continue to struggle with Antonioni. I appreciate the genius of his photography and framing, and his bravery; LEclisse ends with a poetic 5 minute wordless montage unconnected to the characters that elevates the film to another level.  But the ideas continue to feel heavy handed and overstated, the lack of plot substituted for by repeated, if deserved, blasts at our (then) modern world; capitalism, racism, colonialism, and the ennui and alienation of a young upper-class generation that doesnt seem to know what to do to help themselves much less the world around them, including being unable to truly love deeply.  These are valuable and important statements, but next to the subtle poetry of the photography they (to me) feel ham-fisted and very repetitive.  I feel like I get what Anotononi is saying here very quickly, and then it starts to become a slide-show of amazing images.

Less mysterious, less surreal than LAventura, so theres less a sense that one is missing layers.  A woman leaves her fianc, falls for a shallow young stockbroker, and we see that everyone cares more about money and things than human relationships.  The scenes in the stock exchange are amazingly shot, and every frame uses architecture and framing to underline the themes of alienation and the emptiness of modern life.  Monica Vitti and Alain Delon make the two leads more human and real than earlier Antonioni leads.  But a number of scenes just feel clunky.  That said, the experimental last five minutes, which puts the themes in a wider, more global context, is very moving and special.

I'm in a minority in having these reservations, so take them with a grain of salt.  The majority of critics and film-lovers feel this is a masterpiece, though its far more divided than the near universal embrace of LAventura.

Criterion's blu-ray is a clear step up from their quite good older DVD.  A gorgeous transfer",1439510400,6,1934,4.913846153846154
8647516,5,B00J2PQZRQ,"For anyone who is not sure they like old foreign films, this or ""Breathless"" would be ideal places to start.  Both capture a very specific mood, tone, place, time, and emotional landscape.  Only the scenes involving a stock exchange and a stolen car seem ""dated"" to me.  Everything else looks and feels stunningly modern.  The path this woman drifts through is full of randomness and variation.  This is the kind of production that gives you a lot of unexpectedly interesting shots of ordinary places that punctuate what the characters are going through.  It has that rare combination of never being rushed yet never pointless or boring to the audience.  Yet it does ponder existential struggles of ""is this all there is?"" without being obvious.  There is truly elegant camera work throughout.",1432080000,,793,5.0
8647517,5,B00J2PQZRQ,"really have always liked this film from the time of its first US theatrical release.

however, does this amazon disc version of l'eclisse have the actual commentary on the film or, as i found with a library copy of this exact blu-ray title, a commentary on 'riot in cellblock 11' -- not kidding!",1421971200,,295,4.566037735849057
8647518,5,B00J2PQZRQ,"Unjustly, L'Eclisse is considered part of the ""trio of alienation"" along with ""L'Avventura"" and ""LaNotte"".

This knee-jerk reaction couldn't be further from the truth.

""L'Eclisse"" (the eclipse"") is the simple story of a young woman who breaks up with an older man and begins (only begins) a relationship with a younger man, Alain Delon. The crepuscular quality of the story and the images can perhaps be summed by Vitti saying to Delon, ""I wish I loved you more, or not at all.""

Vitti's performance is elegant and fragile, while Alain Delon's body language (""You never stand still"") is a highlight of the movie.

There are horrendously boring scenes at the stock market, and this day I wonder why Antonioni put them in.",1419292800,4,721,4.885245901639344
