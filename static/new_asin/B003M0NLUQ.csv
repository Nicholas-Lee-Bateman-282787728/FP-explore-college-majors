8399995,5,B003M0NLUQ,"This was the first Troma film I ever saw,  and it started my Troma movie addiction.  I am a huge super fan and collector of Troma films, and just recently bought this one. This campy hilarious horror story has a special place in my heart. The acting is over the top, much like you would find in a John Water's film, but less vulgarity. The plot is pretty great, as well as all the characters being utterly uniquely disfunctional and loveable. If you love Troma films,  this us a MUST HAVE classic Troma fan mainstay. If it's not in your Troma collection, or if you're a fan of camp/trash horror, you will love the NewlyDeads. Get it!",1408665600,,633,4.3931623931623935
