7892908,5,6305669244,"This film is deceptively simple, a reminiscence of wartime Japan told from the memories of twin adults who have become artists. As they illustrate their childhood on paper, their tale emerges. What seems artless and simple, holds all the complexities of the times...innocence in a time of uncertainty and war, contrasts between the haves and the have-nots, and the bias of the wealthy landholders toward their tenants. Nothing is there in terms of a grand climax, but everything is there. This film is completely charming and selfless. It is deliciously slow moving....my young daughter asked to watch this again and again, a sure sign of its emotional authenticity.",1481760000,,666,5.175925925925926
7892909,5,6305669244,I love this story about twin Japanese boys shortly after the end of WW11. Very comical how their sister is allowed to tease them about the Gods coming to steal their private parts ;but they were admonished by their mother for saying so innocently that her had been taken. Perhaps it lost something in the translation with the subtitles,1426464000,,335,4.694915254237288
7892910,5,6305669244,"This is less the story of the twins' eighth year, and more an intertwined set of narratives on Japanese cultural attitudes towards conformity, the state of immediately post-WWII Japanese society, and the spiritual freedom that the twins experienced, and how all these contributed to the twins becoming artists. There are some minor errors in the subtitling, but an intelligent viewer will eventually resolve these in their own mind. Yes, this film is a representation of events in their eighth year, but it is an exhibition of influences rather than a story. All the more charming for it.",1416355200,,588,5.072164948453608
7892911,5,6305669244,"This movie has a very thin plot, it is more just a look into the lives of a set of identical twins when they were eight years old. The twins the movie is based on are now successful artists, and their art abilities at the age of eight does play into the movie, but most of the movie is just following how they interacted with each other, their family, and their friends as young children. While the movie is to a large extent reminiscing by the now adult twins, the young boys point of view is included.
While nothing really happens during the movie (from the point of view that there is no plot where something is to be solved or some big event is taking place) it is still fun to watch.",1380067200,,688,4.180451127819549

7892913,5,6305669244,"This film is as slow as a day in your own childhood but with plenty to do and see in the nothing of it all. The vivid transparency  from which the director coaxes  all the many simple details is astonishing. This sort of cinema must be very hard to bring together as almost no one can really pull it off. The Japanese director Ozu was the master of it. And this is about as close as can get to a modern version of him. It's really about the events of two brothers in  childhood  and I can't say enough good about it.
I have seen it twice and I can only imagine it getting better with successive viewings. The only sort of awkward bit for me was when nature talked back in the guise of woodland hags etc.. but I never thought nature needed a human voice to speak for itself.",1147910400,4,773,4.099337748344371
7892914,5,6305669244,"I came across this film at a small art house theatre in New York in 1998. It was recommended to me by a Spanish director who had a Japanese wife. I have watched it a dozen times since, and never grow tired of it. The naturalistic performances Higashi draws from the twins is masterful. The film avoids sentimentality, especially in the way it handles the the uncertain fate of the ruffian new boy in school, and the one fight scene between the brothers (surely a happy accident, it is so realistic). The framing is beautiful, and unlike many Japanese films that deal with rural family life, I didn't find the pace slow at all. Strangely, practically no one in Japan seems to know of this film. Like 'Firefly Dreams,' it is evocative of a particular time and location while having universal appeal. The old witches are funny, too. One of my top five contemporary Japanese films.",1133308800,7,877,4.628205128205129
7892915,2,6305669244,"Being an Oriental I am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours, although not as extensive as standard Hollywood productions. With Japanese films, whether it was made by a Kurusawa or a  more obscure artisan, I can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in  pace, inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals, and are  generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively  substandard.  Village of Dreams, while touted as an award winner  is a  glaring testimony of this stunted Japanese film-making characteristic.  Review it yourself. The pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing. It was  the same character that can be seen even in Kurusawa's Ran - a ""highly  acclaimed"" work that in my case, I couldn't even view for the third  time, because even its DVD resolution has a quality that can only be  likened to the eye-view of a person who's suffering his earliest stage of  creeping glaucoma.  Village of Dreams is so ""relaxed"" as if the  filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they  enjoyed in 1940s Japan in an obscure countryside. At the very least, the  straight narrative of this film is a consolation, but with RAN, the actions  were so hard to follow, you'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking  whom.  The most unforgivable quality of this DVD transfer  is the poor film  stock. The picture approximates that of a ""third generation""  recording of a VHS copy. This means that you'll be sorely dissapointed of  having to get a VHS-quality copy COPIED, in turn, from another VHS copy  which was copied from the original VHS ""master tape"".  Of course,  the DVD transfer is not at fault, its simply that the Japanese despite  their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us a decent film stock, that  could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems. The glaring  deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious, when shown on high  resolution TVs. I've viewed this film in a 29-inch Sony Wega Flat TV, and  in a 50-inch Mitsubishi projection TV, from a Pioneer DVL 919 and 909. If  not for the antics of the two children leads, Village comes off as  wearisome. I bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because  I'm a film collector. Its works like this that whets my appreciation for  world cinema. Unfortunately, Village's poor resolution takes away  gratifying cinematic enjoyment, as well  as negating its  ""collectability"" factor. This should have looked more glorious if  it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like  What Dreams  May Come or Dark City, but of course that's asking too much from those  editing-challenged Japanese filmakers.  I want to ask Amazon for a refund  because this is not well worth its price value. I was compulsed to buy it  because of its cover, I thought it was at least as exotically  glorious-looking as KUNDUN, but it proved to be just a small, obscure  production. Critics may raved about it, just like those Canadians did with  BLACK ROBE, but the final word is that they're just run of the mill, albeit  thoughtful, films.....",951091200,2,3106,4.947470817120623
