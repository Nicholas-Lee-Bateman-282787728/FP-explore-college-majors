8750711,2,B01BMPJ4FS,"I'm giving this DVD 2 out of 5 stars because of several reasons. First off, there's no way the Gergiev footage was recently shot (within the past few years); it looks as if it's from the late 1990s, especially judging from the clothes and camera quality. The footage featuring Stravinsky is already widely available on the internet, not to mention, I own all of it from other better produced DVDs. The clip of Stravinsky rehearsing The Rite of Spring is quite short (circa 10 seconds). Gergiev was only 18 years old (barely college age) when Stravinsky died and I highly doubt the two ever met. Be that as it may, the title is very misleading because the DVD description says that this ""program records the meeting of two Russian musical giants"", again, implying the two [Stravinsky and Gergiev] actually met. I suppose Gergiev was chosen for this DVD because of his Russian heritage. I can think of many other conductors who actually met (and were already conducting at the time they met) Stravinsky; Michael Tilson Thomas or Yuri Temirkanov. Overall, this DVD is essentially a rehearsal of The Right of Spring featuring Gergiev as the conductor, and who also tries to throw in some of his own personal stories. I wouldn't have purchased this DVD (and will be selling it soon) if I had a more accurate description of the DVD and a better title.",1457913600,12,1345,4.727659574468085
