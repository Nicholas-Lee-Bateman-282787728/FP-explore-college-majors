1660488,1,B00005T7H7,"When Cinderella (The original) came out, I could not stop watching it. I would listen to the songs *over* and *over* and *over* again. When I got wind that Cinderella II was coming out, I quickly went to the Disney site and pre-ordered it. I quickly put it in my VCR and started watching. By the end of the movie, I wanted to send EVERYTHING back. I guess I should.
All in all...Cinderella II is THE most disappointing sequel ever. Of course it had music...but not sung by Cinderella herself. I wanted to hear some original voices like in the old movie or new songs in which the Princess herself sang...but no. They stuck in songs that we would label...'bubblegum pop'. Three short stories that really didn't make sense...it didn't have the feeling and emotion of the original. When they TRIED to sound emotional, it came out all cheesy.
Cinderella itself was known for having one of the best original music on it...The sequel puts it to shame. ...
What I was most disappointed as you can all see is that there is no music sung by the characters and if you're hoping for a little more interaction between Cinderella and her Prince...forget it. A few cheesy lines and that's about it. For those of you who bought this, I hope you did enjoy it...I, for one, did not.
Think Disney will make another alternate Cinderella 2 with the originals singing songs? ^_^;; Okay, it's not going to ever come true but what the heck...",1014681600,4,1418,4.564705882352941
1660489,1,B00005T7H7,"Why haven't the Disney people learned to improve the storyline of all their sequels? Even though it is not a long featured cartoon demanding drawing that is not very detailed, that we can tolerate. But Cinderella doesn't look like the original classic at all!
If Peter Pan II is going follow its example, I am never going to believe the Disney's people again!! Fans over the world have paid their price and it's time for sequels writers to get their act together.",1014422400,17,463,4.658536585365853
1660490,1,B00005T7H7,Have just watched this with my two children 4 and 7 and they were bored - it's unimaginative and an insult to people like my Grandfather who worked on the original. What a waste of money. Thank's for yet another rubbish title to collect dust in our homes. I'm very annoyed.,1013644800,44,273,4.372549019607843
1660491,1,B00005T7H7,"I love Disney and generally enjoy their sequel films - Toy Story 2, Rescuers Down Under, Scamp's Adventure, etc. but really dislike the lack of imagination and care shown in this feature.
The animation looks like cheap Cartoon Network tripe and the songs are the worst ever. I never thought I would dislike a film this much!
The extras are very weak and Cinderella has a voice of a teen cheerleader from a sickly 80's film.
Children will be insulted - adults will neither find anything to enjoy except for the trailer which shows the classic, true Disney, film Beauty and the Beast will be on DVD this year.
Considering it on your DVD shelf? Bibidy Bobity DON'T!",1013644800,36,662,4.61864406779661

1660493,2,B00005T7H7,"It isn't often that I find a Disney movie that fails the sensitivity test.  This is one, that, rather unfortunately, falls back on old hackneyed jokes about fat people for a laugh.  Some may feel that it's okay to portray a fat woman (in the first story, of a multi-story movie) being over-eager for breakfast.  Or in the second story, portraying the fat cat as evil, and the fat noble woman as repellant.  Some of the other characters even grimace at her, even though she is well dressed.  Regardless of what parents think, children don't see people as ""pigeonholed"" by body type, skin color, or accent.  They start out curious about life and all the people in it, and imitate the behavior of their parents when reacting to others.

For overweight children, the learned attitudes of the parents translates to verbal abuse and even physical bullying in and out of school. Beset each day by the impossible standard of beauty set by Cinderella and her Prince, the overweight child has these forefront negative characters to relate to, and over and over are reminded by the Disney animators themselves that they are ""repellent"" overeaters that others will avoid.  Now, let's put this in a perspective that more people will understand.  How about I change it to all redheads are repellent overeaters to be avoided at all costs?  Every other aspect, one's personality, likes, dislikes, talents, are completely dismissed because of that glaring head of red hair.  Everybody hates them, you know.  They're disgusting, Heck, even our parents hated them, and the Disney animators aren't wrong, are they?

Ask that child how he or she feels.  Ask them if anyone has tripped them at school, or called them names, or even ganged up on them as they walk home.  They do that stuff, you know, and it's wrong.  Sure, there may be health issues with being overweight, but that's between them and their doctor to deal with.  It should NOT be a reason to concoct these stereotypes so that those children so afflicted are subjected to the subtle and very unsubtle abuse it engenders.  If anything, overweight kids should be given encouragement at every corner to head off depression, bad self image, and poor confidence.  These portrayals are demeaning and they are generalizations since they appear in films over and over exactly the same way.

Recent scientific and medical research is still trying to pinpoint why some struggle so much with being overweight, and others seemingly have no problem at all.  It's not just lifestyle either.  There's more to learn, and clues have appeared in recent years that suggest that corn sugars may be at fault, and also, that the lack of certain species of intestinal biota may play a strong role.  If that is not the case, I'm sure those learned people will tell us.  But if it IS the fault of such things, then isn't the depictions of overweight people as food obsessed or ugly more than a little bit despicable?

Why not let ALL kids revel in the stories Disney can do, and quit finding ways to classify people by physical appearance?  Walt D himself wanted all families to enjoy his works and those done in his name.  But some animation people just can't resist taking sharp, cheap shots at kids who are bad at defending themselves.  It's for the parents to help them grow and become strong, and to protect them from the boorish behavior of others.

I never would have guessed that I would be helping those parents by pointing out what should be obvious.  Use kindness.  It is sweeter, and leaves less scars.",1476144000,,3532,4.769357495881384

1660500,3,B00005T7H7,"These are 3 episodes from a cancelled TV series from 2001. The first two are mediocre and not memorable. However, the 3rd episode involved Anastasia falling in love with a baker; it showed her as a decent person, not a villain. This episode is worth watching. The voices of the mice are hard to understand and are irritating. Cinderella herself comes across as overly nice and sweet, but also smart. The 1st episode was very improbable, with Cinderella trying to make too many changes to the palace decorum, such as having commoners dance with the aristocrats during a festival ball. She would never to allowed to get away with it in real life. Overall, the film is for very small girls. I bought it as I am trying to collect all the animated Disney films, but quite a few aren't really worth seeing. While not horrible, this is not wonderful either.

1660549,5,B00005T7H7,"Despite all the negative reviews, I have to say I LOVED this sequel. It follows through on CInderella's sudden transition to princess, and shows that she's just as kind, sweet, and selfless as she was before. She breaks free of conventional princess standards and shows that being a royal doesn't mean you're too cool to be a good person. The sheer awesomeness of this sequel is why I hate the third movie- it completely negates ALL of this! Even the sweet mice making the book for her! WHY?! So, ever wondered if a princess can bake? If a princess can dress down once in a while? If a princess can care about the people who were mean to her enough to help them after she FINALLY got them out of her life? The answers to your questions will be in this movie. But seriously, if you like this one, don't watch the third.",1392508800,,818,4.352941176470588

1660551,3,B00005T7H7,"Cinderella 2 was a good idea in theory, telling stories from Cinderella's life after marriage, but the follow through wasn't strong enough for me, nor any child in my family. I have no trouble sitting through it because it isn't un-enjoyable, but, still, I feel like it could have been done better.

I think they should have make the first story stronger, and maybe the main focus of the movie, and tied the other two into the set up of the first story so that the movie was actually a movie and not a collection of episodes tied together. I felt like this was to start a Cinderella tv series, but the follow through was too weak to generate the audience for it, unlike Tarzan and Jane that did the same thing and got a series out of it.",1387238400,,737,4.302158273381295

1660565,5,B00005T7H7,"Wow, there are a lot of negative comments on this film!  I didn't buy this film based on the reviews here on Amazon and skipped straight to Cinderella III (a well-done film for direct-to-DVD).  However, I DID get the chance to watch Cinderella II when it aired on cable and I was enchanted!

I suppose that maybe my expectations were sufficiently lowered by reading all these reviews in advance of seeing the film, and perhaps I am not a connoisseur of Disney films that these other reviewers are (even though I own about 30 Disney animated films!), but I REALLY LIKED this film!  It was sweet, fun, easy to follow and I liked the 3-vignette format.  You got to peek into Cinderella's palace life from a couple of different perspectives and because of that I think a better title would be the one suggested by the top negative commenter... ""Cinderella II: Tales from the Castle.""

Perhaps it would have been a stronger film if it had been one continuous plot and not 3 vignettes strung together but it's perfectly charming the way it is.  My 3-year-old girl watched 2 out of the 3 vignettes and was captivated (then she had to go to bed).  I watched the remaining one after she went to bed and thought it was sweet.  No, none of this is complex like ""Cinderella III: A Twist In Time"" but it's perfectly suited for a Cinderella fan & parents, too.

As for the songs, even though they weren't remarkable like the ones from Disney's theatrically-released films, they were perfectly suited to the film regarding the words.  Although, the R&B-style singer may not have been the best choice of styles but the singer is talented & listenable.  I found the music WAY BETTER than that of ""Return of Jafar"" or the Beauty & the Beast Christmas-themed film (my senses were completely offended by those films!).

If you have a little girl who loves princesses, especially Cinderella, this is a great film!",1363478400,,1892,4.645645645645645

Cinderella the original is better by far and shouldn't have such an atrocious sequel. This movie is bloodcurdling, nasty, horrid, and very easy to detest. It makes the hairs on my neck stand on end. The movie's called 'Dreams Come True' but for me it was a nightmare. The movie is pointless and a large waste of time, and the characters act insolent, barbaric, arrogant, hostile, dispicable, and too happy to be realistic.

1660613,2,B00005T7H7,"I am a big fan of the original Cinderella due to it's classic storyline, and the fact that Cinderella sets a wonderful moral example for my little girl.  In the original, Cinderella is the epitomy of grace under hardship: she doesn't speak badly of her step-mother or step-sisters, she doesn't make fun, she doesn't whine or even complain, and she tried to make the best of a bad situation by being positive--even singing while she does her chores.

I had a feeling that the sequel wouldn't be on par with the original.  For one thing, it has the unfortunate title of being a ""sequel"". Second, the newer Disney movies are continually disappointing when it comes to having main characters set examples for our children (think of the little mermaid whining about her life, and even Nemo saying to his father ""I hate you"", etc).  Still, I wanted to see this movie, because i wanted to see what happens--i couldn't help myself.

Well, I'm disappointed.  I don't mind the 3 storylines--it's a fairly creative idea. However, the creativity within the storylines is lacking and a little generic. I don't mind the animation (the first wasn't perfect either, since it was an early Disney movie).  The problem is the characters and the music.  Cinderella is NOT the same character as in the first movie.  She is not the same pillar of grace and makes some comments to prove it.  She also advises her step-sister in the third movie, ""It's time to stop following someone else's orders and follow your own heart""-or something of the sort--to which i have to say this: maybe that's true to a point, but i don't appreciate that point being taught to my daughter by her hero Cinderella, who is talking to her step-sister about going against her own mother.  Then Cinderella listens as Anastasia defies her mother's orders to her face, and smiles with relief.

The music is anything but classic--I don't like it. I prefer the sweet princess-like music to it.

And I don't like how the prince hardly appears.  I would have liked to see his character more developed.

All and all, it was enjoyable to see Cinderella in her new home, but the Disney could have done a far better job.",1203120000,,2162,4.69761273209549

1660619,4,B00005T7H7,"Surprisingly, this 2002 sequel to Disney's 1950 classic isn't a complete stinker.  Certainly not a great work of art, but if your kid has been sucked into the Cinderella/princess vortex, this DVD is okay to watch.  Terrible music, but the story is okay.

There are three short stories on here, strung together with a negligible through-line that involves C.'s mouse friends, Gus and Jaq.  The first story finds Cinderella, a post-honeymoon princess, bored stiff with palace life and chafing at the tedious demands of royal fashion and protocol.  She undoes the snobbishness of the palace and invites her old friends -- the townspeople and peasants -- to the big royal ball.  Most importantly, she is true to herself (cue the music) and true to her dreams.

In another story, one of C.'s wicked stepsisters experiences character growth and finds redemption when she falls in love, and sees what it's like to have a bigger heart.  Her sister and mother remain spiteful and mean, leaving room for another story or two along the same line.  Lucifer, the mean old tomcat, also falls in love, but still likes to chase mice.

The main disappointment here is how dull and underdeveloped the Prince character remains: he looks hunky, but has no personality.  That's problematic, because it implies romance is only about looks, and the contrast between his blandness and Cinderella's relative complexity is a bit odd.

All in all, this is passable fare -- about the level of a ""good"" Saturday morning cartoon.  Adults won't have as much to enjoy here as in the original film, but you won't necessarily be driven crazy this cartoon, or feel your child is being poisoned with horrible imagery or overly sexist messages.  The emphasis is mostly on individuality and the redemptive power of being nice to other people.  Cinderella is assertive, within very girly confines, and there isn't a lot of violence.  You could do worse.

1660622,1,B00005T7H7,"Oh Disney! You make some true jewels, and then there's Cinderella II. Plastic, short- sighted, half-hearted.

Dismal stories, so-so animation, and shameless exploitation of a classic with a few poorly-done silly antics scenes to brainwash the kids into liking it. Cinderella's voice sounded stiff and fake, like the actor was trying to hard, not sweet and genuine heart- of- gold like the first.

They should have cut the first two stories and put more effort into developing a decent story out of the third, about Anastasia falling in love. AND, learned from their omission in the first Cinderella and made the Prince a more 3-d character!

1660625,5,B00005T7H7,"""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"" is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original Cinderella and a few new ones. The animation is amazing --- it's filled with lush color (except for muted color when the story calls for it) and the animation looks very polished. It's really a sight to see.

The three stories in this are called, according to the closing credits --- ""Aim To Please,"" ""Tall Tail"" and ""An Uncommon Romance."" These stories are all tied together with the idea that the Fairy Godmother is helping the mice to make a storybook about the adventures of them and Cinderella since the time that Cinderella met the Prince. The very first story finds Cinderella arriving at the castle after her honeymoon. The Prince is forced to rush away on important state business and Cinderella is left in charge of the royal banquet/ball. She has no idea what she's supposed to do and so this woman named Prudence is assigned to help her out. But will Cinderella be able to pull this together in time and in a way that will please the King?

The second story, ""A Tall Tail"" finds Cinderella in preparation for the Spring Festival. Jaq wants to help out, but it seems like Cinderella no longer has any time for him. He makes a wish to become human.

The final story contains the surprising premise that Cinderella's stepsister Anastasia is falling in love with a breadmaker at market. The Evil Stepmother forbids this romance, but Cinderella decides to show Anastasia that even she can have a dream come true.

The voice talent is amazing. They did a great job of casting people who made the voices sound just like the original film. Unless you're really listening hard, you'll be hard-put to notice any difference at all.

The music in this film is a combination of themes from the original and a few new songs performed by Brooke Allison. I'd never heard anything by Brooke Allison before (that I know of), but she's an amazing artist. Perhaps the most surprising piece is the closing credits number (also featured as a music video) --- a techno version of ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" called ""Put it Together."" It works quite well. Another great song is ""Follow Your Heart.""

For a Disney sequel, this DVD also has some nice special features. There's the aforementioned music video, which features entirely of clips from the film, rather than the recording session by Brooke Allison. However, you do get to see some of the recording in the Musical Magical Featurette, which also includes an examination of the film's score by the composer. There's a Cinderella Storybook, which allows you to read a story about Jaq and Mary with or without narration. The Enchanted Castle game is fairly simple, but not too bad --- you get to help with the decoration and cleanup of Cinderella's castle, preparing a meal and dressing Cinderella. There's also a DVD-ROM game called Cinderella's Dollhouse. Finally, of course, this DVD has the usual previews/trailers for other movies, but perhaps not so usual. This is a great set of trailers. There's a promo for the ""Beauty and the Beast"" Special Edition DVD in which they talk about how they inserted ""Human Again"" into the film. Also including in this set is a neat Disney DVD ""Pure Digital Magic"" promo that I had never seen before.

This DVD is truly a worthy edition to the Disney Cinderella story. It really has everything you could want from a sequel to this film and doesn't ruin the original story in any way.",1135555200,6,3467,4.749169435215947
1660628,3,B00005T7H7,"Sequels can be a sign of lack of ideas, a channel for new messages and stories or just a continuation of a story that never did really end ... like Friday the 13th .

Cinderella II becomes a mix of my categories above. Cinderella ended as stories end - the prince and princess lived happily ever after. In many, a sequel wasn't necessary. When taking the initiative to make a sequel, the level of demand becomes a bit higher - and in my case Disney comes too short, it only fulfils 70 percent of my expectation.

The characters, who amused or irritated us in Cinderella are back. Jaq, Gus, Cinderella and the prince (still without name ...), the father-in-law, the minister, Lucifer, Ferry God mother, Step mother and sisters. The film starts with Gus and Jaq hurrying to listen to Ferry God Mother reading the first Cinderella story. The fact that it ends makes them wonder if they can't write their own ferry tale - and of course with help of some ferry magic the new chapters of the book are written.

The first story is about Cinderella getting used to royal life and codes. She receives the responsibility to arrange a reception. She is supposed to be instructed by three ladies - who are well aware of what is right and what is wrong. The song theme of this part is about being yourself.

The second story is about Jaq and how frustrated he is about not being needed as before. His wish about becoming a human is answered and with a Bobbidi boo he become a human. The song theme is about changing and its good and bad sides.

The third, which I think is the best chapter, is about Anastasia, the red-haired step sister of Cinderella. We discover a girl, dreaming of love just as Cinderella dreamed once and of course, when she take the step to make that dream come true. The song theme is about making oneself chic!

The beautiful theme song of the whole film is ""Put it together"" and it captures what the film is really about: being yourself and fighting for the good cause - love, justice u name it! The songs are wonderful and great -worth listening to and dancing also! The bonus part of DVDs are always the same. The games are a bit funny  and weird - finding the tiara and preparing for the bawl?! The music clip ""Put it together"" and the music documentary is worth watching.

It felt really intrigued by the third chapter, because I needed this opening of either-or categories of the step family. Anastasia needed a more correct picture that the envious horrible step sis.

The new characters are a good complement to the rest: they are the cat of the castle, Pom-Pom, human Jaq and the third I will not reveal - watch the third story!

I had expected to ""get to know"" the prince - he became so supporting actor in the film. He is so princy and absent. Cinderella feels a bit different, her way of moving and talking is so 21st century - she isn't the Cinderella in the first film and she moves so weird in this film. Anyway, I didn't like her. The fact that she goes around in her usual cleaning clothes in the castle is more unrealistic than the magic in it! It is the same Cinderella who cried over her bawl dress!

Yes, sequels are difficult but this gets away with 3 stars.",1135555200,4,3191,4.409863945578231

1660631,4,B00005T7H7,"+ It's one of those ""I don't know why I like it because I know most of it is horrible but I do like it somehow anyway!"" movies.
+ The simplistic, light, peaches-and-cream storylines are enjoyable to watch and allow for the use of imagination to add to them.
+ The music is admittedly catchy. The tunes can't touch the songs of Disney classics, but this *is* more of a series of after-the-fact Cinderella cartoons; wouldn't it have been slightly embarrassing to waste outstanding music?
+ Pom Pom the white cat attacking `Sir Hugh' is very funny when seen in slo-mo.
+ So is the bit with the King and the elephant.
+ In the previous film, the prince had wanted to have as many choices as possible at the ball, so of course everyone--including commoners--had been invited. In the first story (and the best story) of this movie, you see what life is like in the castle & the strict royal rules that must be enforced until Cinderella gets away with shaking things up. Luckily for her, the King is easily persuaded (just dump some chocolate pudding on his head), and basically says, ""S'alright, this ish is acceptable."" Yo.
+ It gets laughs at parts that I think were intended for laughing. `Hyah!'
+ Rather interesting characters for a sequel. Beatrice, Daphne, Prudence, Pom Pom, Sir Hugh, and yes, that Countess LeGrande.
+ The Grand Duke gets a girl! He and Prudence--a perfect pair.
+ So Anastasia is redeemed in this movie! How nice. Though when they took up the task of doing the ugly stepsisters, they really took the ugly part seriously. Even Drusilla seems to be enlightening toward the end. Only thing is, Stacy's change into a romantic person who falls very suddenly in love with a random village baker doesn't seem totally genuine. He doesn't have much reason to just hook up with her, but he does.
+ There are a number of couples in the movie--Cinderella and the Prince, Jacques and Mary, Lucifer and Pom Pom, Prudence and the Grand Duke, the Countess and Hugh, & Anastasia and the Baker. Great if you like that sort of thing. Only problem with that is, you end up feeling much more for other couples than for the one that was supposed to be the focus of the movie in the first place, which was Cinderella and her `true love' prince.

- It isn't so much a sequel as a string of cartoons  la the Jasmine and Ariel videos.
- It doesn't attempt to be very profound, like ""The Lion King II,"" but at least it isn't a complete disaster like the sequels to Tarzan, Lady and the Tramp, the Little Mermaid, and so many others.
- The lack of Prince. Cinderella apparently has her happy-ever-after without him. It might be ""Into the Woods"" ringing in my head but I'd bet he's offscreen for almost the entire film probably messing around with someone else. 'Sorry I have to rush off on important matters of state' my foot. Not only is his relationship with Cinderella made out to be superficial, but his flat personality is too.
- The movie builds up to an ending where all Cinderella does is read a poorly crafted book of stories that happened to them all in the castle, made by her rodent and avian friends with some help from the Fairy Godmother.
- For the most part the animation and writing are decent, at least, but there are instances where this quality drops and it's pretty laughable (ie, some of the mice dialogue, Cinderella's two-pinprick nose in the beginning, Gus's quip about a `big chair' for Princess Cinderelly, the `at least I can stay up past midnight,' and the whole Anastasia/Baker thing.)
- The second story is about the Fairy Godmother transforming Jacques the dissatisfied mouse into a human (Sir Hugh--in his attempt to say, ""I'm human,"" he's cut off and thought to be called Hugh) to prove to him that he won't be more useful just because he's bigger. (He's doomed to a life of uselessness regardless of his species.) This plot kind of screams Saturday morning cartoon instead of the Cinderella sequel most were probably hoping for, no matter how amusing it is.
- The lack of babies. (Probably not for long, but still, you might not be able to tell if there are any in the movie.)
- What's with that baker? Seriously.
- Lucifer's relationship with Pom Pom is over much too quickly.",1121904000,14,4205,4.575596816976128

The film was really three different stories - and I felt that each one added very little to the Cinderella story at all.  The fairy godmother is just now apparently everyone's fairy godmother.  Even the mouse!
While some younger girls I know liked the film, they agreed it wasn't up to the standard of the orginal stories.  Frankly, Walt Disney would be sick.  Why he isn't haunting the heck out of the company's higher-ups, I'll never know.

1660637,1,B00005T7H7,"Which was a bigger crime against childhood: Making this movie at all, or deciding to charge $26 for it
The movie, if you can call it that, is actually a series of vignettes told by the mice of all people.  Only one is specifically about Cinderella, one is mainly about Jaque the mouse, and one is about Anastasia the formerly evil stepsister.
The one about Cinderella is first and within the first 3 minutes, Prince Charming leaves on business, leaving Cinderella to the ""domestic"" task of planning some party with some crabby lady who's always done it before to teach her how things are done in the palace.  Cinderella is completely unable to take on the ""princess role"" grows tired of this and decides to do it her own way, which is of course infinitely more fun than the royal way.
In the second the fairy godmother (who apparently grants wishes to mice now) turns Jaques into a human because he wants to be able to help her.  He is, of course, still afraid of PomPom the castle cat.  Turns out he likes being a mouse.  Then there is this totally contrived situation where the king is clinging to a rampaging elephant that can only be stopped by, you guessed it, a mouse.  Jaques is turned back into a mouse and saves the day.
The third short is about Anastasia who falls in love with the baker.  Stepmother hates this of course, but with two or three words of encouragement Anastasia stands up to mom and invites the Baker to the ball.
I understand the desire to have Cinderella do something other than get rescued by falling in love with a prince, but geez, put an ounce of effort into it!
The ""plot"" in this ""movie"" is the only thing worse than the animation, which is not any better than the original Cinderella, and might in fact be worse.
I know, I'm an adult, and clearly not the target market for this ""movie"".  My daughter is though.  This is the child that sat through all of Monsters Inc at age 16 months, not to mention all the other original disney flicks.

1660682,3,B00005T7H7,"I rented this one -- thank goodness! -- because my daughter REALLY wanted to see it, and I thought my two sons would enjoy it as well. Was I wrong!
The storyline is similar to the disaster of Beauty & the Beast Christmas -- three ""shorts"" that are put together to make a new movie, instead of a complete storyline. The bonuses of it are: they have tried to stay in keeping with the ""canon"" of the original movie -- characters look similar, etc. The music is enjoyable (apparently) for children. My daughter (11) especially liked it. The mice were back.
The sore spot: the animation is terrible! The faces are blurred and undefined. I assume they attempted to keep them ""equal"" to the animation of the original film, but I, for one, would have been quite pleased to see a little more detail. My older son (4) stood up and walked away from the TV. His comment: The girls are all ugly! He did eventually sit down to watch the rest of the film.
A good film, magical and better the more you watch it, definitely, but the animation is deplorable.
Regarding the DVD quality? Very good. I think it makes the lack of detailing of the character's faces look even worse. I found myself squinting the whole time trying to make out non-existent features. The sound is nicely done, too, though the music is not about to compare to either the classics that Disney himself used or the later music of The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, or Tarzan.",1020124800,2,1423,4.498069498069498

I kept wanting to buy it but kept seeing the price rise and eventually gave into it.  Anyway, I watched it the first time and wasn't too impressed...there was a really adorable scene between Lucifer and the other female white fat cat...Lucifer falls for her and there's about a 2 minute scene where lucifer is at the bottom of the stair case looking up at the other cat but that is just about as far as it goes.  I really didn't like the whole ""Jack turning into Sir Hue"" thing...that was kind of dumb...okay, REALLY dumb!  I would have rather seen the princess have a baby or something sweet like that.  A lot of the same phrases ""zug zug"" were used from the original which was cool and eventually the voices even sorta half sounded like the original ones.  The animation wasn't nearly as good as the original but then Disney sequels rarely are.  Bottom line?  It's a children's movie!  Most adults aren't going to be too amused with it at first!  But give it a chance!  After spending a lot of money on a 1 hour DVD watch it more than once...don't give up on it.  I began to love it.  I still don't approve of some of the music (too harsh/pop) and some of the sayings (This hair *ewww!* --valley girl accent--) but it really is a cute movie once you've watched it two or three times.

The animation is awful and the stories are boring, the only story in which Cinderella is the main character is the first one and she plays a secondary character in the other two (this is supposed to be a Cinderella video).

This direct-to-video sequel to a Disney classic is a prime example of perfectly good magnetic tape gone to waste.  Sloppy, unskilled animation (which Walt Disney himself would have relegated to the cel-scrubbing crew) hastily hacked out by an untrained overseas unit, stories that diminish the original's satisfying closure, and voices that will send your child crying from the room all add up to a miserable, torturous experience.  People watch Disney animation for a reason--they want that magical experience that comes from wonderful artistry, and a fun story, well told.

1660700,1,B00005T7H7,"What made me mad about this movie is that it didn't make me nearly as mad as I thought it would. I expected to be in righteous froth of feminist outrage by the time Cinderellas second movie wrapped, but it just didn't happen. I obviously have some problems with the Disneys original Cinderella; any movie that suggests that a womans salvation depends on a handsome Prince Charming to sweep in and pull her from her distasteful circumstances leaves me a little aggravated. Sure, sure, I see that Cinderella labors passionately and without complaint to help her family, and that she counters bad times with a sunny voice and disposition. And sure, I could argue that that makes her an admirable and noble character. But generally, I just want her to speak up and put her life in order all on her own.
  Cinderella II does not start off well. Cindy arrives at the castle after the marriage to Prince Charming to find that her new life primarily consists of being the castles official party planner. Theres a banquet in two days and Cindy simply must pull off a traditional gathering, complete with stewed prunes for dessert. Her hillbilly sensibilities get the better of her, and she decides that she must be true to her nature by putting on the kind of shindig shed like to attend. Theres no real drama here, howeverwe know that no matter what kind of party Cindy puts on, everyone will be thoroughly charmed by her and love the results. And guess whatcommoners and royal folk mix and mingle, eating chocolate pudding for dessert and boogying to a bluegrass band, and Cinderella receives high praises for her untraditional ways.
  Two other short cartoons about Cindys new life follow, told by her extremely faithful group of mice. In ""Tall Tail,"" mouse leader Jacques indulges his strange attraction to Cinderelly by having the fairy godmother turn him human so he can be more ""helpful"" to his blond companion. The premise of this one bothers me a little, but Im sure Im reading more into this relationship than was really intended. All ends wellJacques realizes hes better as a mouse and he goes back to his plain mousy girlfriend, Mary.
  The last story is the best. In it, Cindys ugly redheaded stepsister falls in love with the tubby baker boy, and has to fight against her evil mother to be with the man she wants. Cindy helps her learn to smile and follow her dreams, and the outcome is sweet and predictable. The one part of this cartoon that stood out for me was when Anastasia, distraught over how to win her man, says to Cindy, ""Youre beautiful! Its always been easy for you!"" Cindy replies, ""Easy? Thats not how I remember it."" It reminded me of when my mother calmly informed a much shorter version of myself that we shouldnt hate people who are rich, because they often worked hard to get there, and we shouldnt hate people who are beautiful, because everyone has their own problems. The dialogue in this movie handles those kinds of acceptance themes nicely.
  The overriding theme of these stories is ""be true to yourself."" Cinderella is charming and nice almost to the point of being annoying, but not quite. And Ill admit, most of the resourcefulness and innovative thinking in these stories comes not from Cindy, but from the mice. Even so, Im not mad at Cindy at the endI even like her a little. Which makes me just furious.",1017273600,5,3342,4.671768707482993
1660721,2,B00005T7H7,"Disney has again produced a sequel that was both not asked for, nor was it needed. But since it exists now, the only thing that can be done is to make the best of it. However, how much can you make from a movie that was obviously made for the sake of the buck? There was no story left to make this sequel (the film makers themselves acknowledged this), and you can tell while you are watching the film that they had very little to go on.
The overlapping story that connects the vignettes (where the mice make a new Cinderella book) is very weak. Then there are the three ""stories"", all of which have the same ""be yourself to succeed"" message. Over all, the vignettes are tolerable entertainment, but the main problem here is that the characters were so contemporized, that it seperates ""Dreams"" from it's original. For example, Cinderella saying ""Ewww"" like a 90's high school girl, and most disturbingly the Wicked Stepmother asking ""huh?!"". You just can not see the characters in the original saying things like this. The Prince and the King were completey different in the sequel, with the King acting like a little kid in the second story. And doesn't Anastasia sound like Daisy Duck (same actress voices both)? Making things worse are the songs, they are all pop and not really good at all.
This movie will certainly entertain kids. Grown ups should be a little disturbed at what Disney has come to to make money. Gone are the days when we could see the original classic with its terrific animation, songs, and characters without knowing that there was a sequel with flat television animation, bubble gum pop songs, and badly voiced characters.",1017187200,4,1649,4.689655172413793

THIS IS NO CLASSIC. It resembles one of those badly produced knock off videos that people accidentally buy thinking they're getting the original film.
Except that this film is a Disney film.
Cinderella 2 only comes close to resembling a Disney film in the name only (Disney)....sadly there is nothing else to recommend it.
Actually this film has been produced with no attention to the very things that made Disney a household name.
The animation is Saturday Morning style which appears stilted and lacks finesse. Both the story and songs are poor. Overall, Cinderella 2 bathes in it's own mediocrity.

This shouldn't even be considered a movie, it's more like a Cheap Cartoon. Also, it is as if they rushed through the entire movie making process. The colors are extremely dull and the scenery is anything, but eye catching. In the very first scene there is a pink sky. How believeable is that?! Furthermore, don't even get me started about the music. I never knew you could even put pop music and a sequel to such a classic movie in the same sentence. Does anyone else remember how great the singing was in the first Cinderella was? I feel sorry for all of the young kids in the world who want to base their life on Cinderella's, as I once did. Who would want to do that after seeing this movie though? It is like a bad soap opera. I say this because each of the three ""mini-movies"" are just badly written love stories. Besides, the entire movie is totally predictable. I'm afraid I'll never be able to look at Disney the same. In my opinion, they should have taken their time adding some substance into this script instead of just trying to make as much money as they possibly can by marketing such a horrible movie!

What you get in this video is a series of three 'what-if' stories composed by Cinderella's mouse friends. With some `Tom and Jerry' cat and mouse style scenes thrown in.
The first two tales are marginal at best. The third story had promise but fell flat... There is simply too little time to explore the growing  relationship between one of Cindy's evil `stepsister ' and the town baker, but this story was at least cute and intriguing.
The animation was defiantly B-Grade, and Cinderella's outdated 'do' is only out-matched by the plastic-like prince who has about four lines in the entire cartoon.
If I could suggest improvements, I would have expanded the third story, to make it a major subplot and TRULY explored the life of Cinderella after marriage. What's it like being married to `Prince Charming'? Is there any conflict? How does Cinderella reconcile her differences with her `evil' stepmother and stepsisters? Is being `beautiful' and `nice' enough to rule the kingdom, or does Cindy have to develop new skills, such as leadership, determination and political skills?",1015632000,25,1193,5.055837563451776
1660744,1,B00005T7H7,"I think children over the age of 7 or 8 would be bored.  As [others] have noted, it is really three short stories on one DVD; the link between the stories is the premise that the mice are putting together a storybook of Cinderella and the castle.
Two things could have been better:  Cinderella wanders around the castle and in town in her old workdresses (a little longer than knee-length, apron, hair tied back).  I would have liked it better if Cinderella had worn prettier gowns, though not dressed up as ornately as the palace staff would have it.
The second thing is that the movie ridicules people ""of size.""  For example, there is one fat woman in the story where Jac is upset because he can't help Cinderella because he's just a mouse.  The fat woman is shown as being stupid, insensitive to others (couldn't discern that a human Jac was not attracted to her -- was actually repulsed by her), and hysterical (in her reaction to seeing a mouse).  In the first story, the fat lady-in-waiting is a giggling not-bright mess.  Her reaction to Cinderella cooking breakfast was the typical ""fat person"" reaction to food -- enraptured and obsessed (implied).
Fat people are one of the few groups of people that are openly ridiculed in our society, in print, movies, and television.

As the other reviewers stated, this is actually 3 stories in one, rather than one long story. That said, the first two stories were awful, and the last was mediocre. The singing...UGHHHHHH!! What were they thinking. I have to say, in the first story, after Cinderella decides to do everything ""her own way,"" the high notes sung in the subsequent scenes were enough to make little dogs cringe in pain. Sorry Disney.
I really expected much more out of this and was sorely disappointed. All other Disney sequels were not THIS bad and I hope Disney does not plan on releasing similiar bad sequels. As it is, I want my money back on this one! Now I am just looking forward to purchasing Beauty and the Beast sometime this November.
If Disney decides to produce any more sequels of this quality, I certainly will stop buying.",1015372800,11,1246,4.5625

Another classic tarnished...the songs are so bad, my 4 year old told me ""these songs are driving me crazy, turn them off"".

It is divided into three stories happening after Cinderella and Prince Charming return for their honeymoon. Cinderella learns what it is like for a Princess. I was entertained THE WHOLE TIME. The song are also nice, nothing like the original, but they keep you upbeat.
This is THE BEST Disney sequel ever, I like it because they keep the focus on Cinderella and not someone's boring 12 year old child.
Disney...this is truely a masterpiece I will FOREVER treasure!",1015113600,2,639,4.663716814159292

AND, one of the ""evil"" stepsisters becomes ""good"", and just to add on to that, the music is pop, get real!

1660775,5,B00005T7H7,"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True is a perfect sequel to the stunning original. Despite Disney's previous lackluster attempts at sequels to other animated hits like Pocahontas and The Lion King, Cinderella II, actually has substance, heart, creativity, and stunning animation that is comparable to the non-straight to VHS original. All of our favorite characters from the original are here again, including Cinderella, Prince Charming, the Fairy Godmother, and everyone's favorite three mice. The story, which lasts about eighty minutes, revolves around the Fairy Godmother sharing tales with the mice, who want to create a book for Cinderella. From there, the three tales that make up the movie begin. The first, revolves around Cinderella's first attempts at social grace, preparing a gala event in her own unique, benevolent way. Fed up with the austere ways of court and her newest mentor Prudence, she transforms the staid gala into a dazzling spectacle for nobles and the bourgeoisie of the kingdom alike. In the second tale, Jacque get his dreams fulfilled of being human, and a supposed consequent 'real' help to Cinderella. The Fairy Godmother obliges and Jacque becomes a baron who helps Cinderella organize a royal festival. The latest edition, a darling cat named Pom-Pom, still knows that Jacque is simply a mouse and pursues him throughout the animated tale. It's hilarious, darling, and heart-warming. The festival is a resounding success and Jacque learns that as a mouse, he is indeed a real help to Cinderella, despite his small size. In the third tale, Cinderella's step-sister Anastasia is looking for love and Cinderella, once she finds out, brings her and the village baker together in a touching tale. While the evil step-mother is still up to her old tricks, wanting Anastasia to marry a member of the gentry, true love wins out in the end. The animation of this movie is superb, with sweeping views of the village, a grand castle, and Cinderella's beautiful outfits. This is an endearing sequel to a beautiful original movie. Kids and adults are sure to enjoy it! A definite 5 star achievement.",1015027200,2,2117,5.121387283236994
1660776,2,B00005T7H7,"I was a little leery of anything Disney puts out ""direct to video/DVD"".  It usually indicates an inferior product.  While I can't really call this DVD inferior, it is disappointing.  It is not an entire movie, rather three short stories (cartoons) revolving around Cinderella after the honeymoon.  The cartoons (as I refer to them) are not up to the animation standards of the original, but then few things these days are.  The stories are cute for children, with a few lessons hidden within.  As an adult, I would rate the DVD an overall two stars.
My five year-old daughter (a HUGE Cinderella fan) however, gave it five stars.
My impression of the DVD is:  Little girls under 8 will LOVE the DVD.  Most everyone else will be lukewarm about it.",1015027200,2,745,4.676923076923077

The movie has a mixture of old favorites and new charmers that is bound to enchant younger children and at least leave adults with a smile and a head shake.
True, the popular music is very out of place, but the sweet storyline of all three shorts is sure to catch children in the spell of Disney's classic all over again.",1014940800,,452,4.206896551724138

She watched it for the first time a few months ago and we must have seen it at least 9 or 10 times since. So now to the sequel. After about 20 minutes my daugher said come on daddy lets play. The animators must be the same one's that worked on Speed Racer, and the music just doesn't fit. On the plus side my daughter likes the picture on the cover. Unfortunately I promised my daughter I would buy this video so what could I do? If you haven't made the same mistake rent it first. Maybe they can cryogenically freeze this sequel with the hopes that some day in the future they can find a cure for it. I'm sure that's what Uncle Walt would've wanted.",1014940800,3,753,4.094594594594595
1660790,1,B00005T7H7,"I am a huge Disney fan, a true child inside as you may say.  Cinderella is one of my favorite movies ever so I was looking forward to rent this sequel because the preview looked great!
But I was so disappointed at the poor quality of the animations, that looked more like a WB cartoon show than a professional, classic blockbuster.  The music accompanying it sounded more like a silly attempt to improve the flick.  The story was cheesy and childish (I know it's a kids movie but the appeal of great Disney movies attract adults as well) and I felt mocked and underestimated as a viewer.
Do you know the cute funny things that are in Disney cartoons that make you smile? (it's hard to describe it another way). Well, there was none of that in Cinderella II which leads me to believe that this film was created only to make a few extra bucks and not enough time was put into it.
And simply and swiftly, the person I was watching the movie with said: ""You can take Cinderella out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of Cinderella."" (that's the point of the sequel)
If you are going to make a sequel of a huge movie like Cinderella you must live up to expectations, not fail miserably! Thank goodness I only rented it!...",1014940800,3,1231,4.366812227074236

1660793,2,B00005T7H7,"I've often said that Cinderella 2's biggest problem, when you get beyond the fact that it was clearly made purely for kids and is really just another form of  princess ""merchandise,"" is that it was falsely advertised to increase sales. Disney does that quite often with their direct-to-video releases, and it makes it difficult to distinguish the good ones from the bad before buying or renting. And, make no mistake, Disney DOES make some very good direct-to-video releases. Cinderella 3, for example, is an excellent film. Cinderella 2... not so much. It's the title that's the biggest problem for the consumer though. ""Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True"" implies some grand, feature-length sequel to the classic Disney film. In fact, that is nothing like what you actually get here. Again, for something like that, I recommend ""Cinderella 3: A Twist In Time."" Cinderella 2 would have been better titled ""Mouse Mouse Tales"" or ""Tales From Cinderella's Castle."" See, that's all it really is. It's three tales from the mice that were Cinderella's best friends since before she became a princess.

In truth, the stories really aren't that bad. Okay, the first one is kinda weak, and it's the one that is the most about Cindy herself, but the other two are pretty interesting. The stories are introduced by the mice and the Fairy Godmother as they work to make a gift for Cinderella, a book she can read to them about their first experiences after moving into the castle. Something I found a bit odd in these sequences was how these storybook-period characters had access to Crayolas and number-two pencils. The first tale is about Cinderella struggling to do things right in the castle in preparation for a ball and finally realizing she must do things ""her"" way. The Second story is about Jaq the mouse making a wish to be a human so that he can be more helpful to Cinderella. Of course, by the end of the story, he learns that he's better off being a mouse. In the third story, Cinderella plays matchmaker for her apparently not so bad stepsister, Anastasia. Anastasia has fallen in love with the village baker, and he with her. It's probably the best story, but in the sad tradition of Shrek and OTHER films, in teaching its moral it also teaches that unattractive people belong with unattractive people, and beautiful people with beautiful people. I'll jump for joy when one of these films gets the anti-superficiality statement right! Oh, and Lucifer the cat makes a deal with the mice to help him win the heart of Pom Pom, the palace feline. Naturally, that doesn't work out.

  While the film is watchable, depending of course on how much you love animation and how much quality is necessary in said medium to hold your interest, it all feels like a long episode of an animated series aimed at a very young, female crowd. The songs are atrocious. They're not good and they don't fit! The voices don't do much to recall those in the original film, especially Cinderella's and the Fairy Godmother's. The mice are fine but speak too clearly in comparison to the original film. Cinderella is out of character at times (seems more like the more recent Disney princesses), and the film does nothing to help us get to know Prince Charming more. As for the animation, well, while the characters are recognizable, they are extremely flat and without style. It all basically looks like TV animation. Sometimes good TV animation, sometimes bad TV animation. Overall, it's a cheap Cinderella experience to recruit younger consumers and maybe provide a little enjoyment for those fans of the original that aren't too particular about quality or substance. ""Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True"" isn't without its entertainment value, especially for small girls or fans of Cindy's mice, and surely it's a must for the completist collector, but if you're looking for something really good to compliment the original, go for ""Cinderella 3: A Twist In Time."" It's not perfect, and the very first moments might make you worry, but if you give it time, you'll find it to be a wonderful experience. Cinderella 3 succeeds nearly everywhere that Cinderella 2 fails.

As for the extras on Cinderella 2, they're nothing to write home about. There's a simple game that basically lets you experience what it's like to be Cinderella. You have to clean up parts of the castle. It's actually kinda fun, but I can't imagine playing it more than once. There's a DVD-Rom activity called ""Cinderella's Doll House Game,"" but I don't bother with DVD-Rom stuff. You also get a music video of one of the horrible songs set to clips from the film and a featurette on the film's awful music. Finally, there's a pretty lame Cinderella story that you can have read to you or read by yourself. Yeah, the extras are pretty awful on this DVD. Still, as I said, it's okay if you just have a Cinderella fanatic in your home that doesn't require everything to be feature film quality. If you ever had the desire for a Cinderella animated series, this might be welcome in your DVD collection. Myself, I am a Disney fanatic, and I love their gorgeous princesses, so owning this is simply a must, even if it is disappointing on many levels.",1014768000,103,5186,4.788826815642458
1660794,5,B00005T7H7,"This is one of the best straight to video movies ever! It's much better than ""Lady and the Tramp 2""! While it is clearly targeted at girls younger than 13, my 9 year old brother and I enjoyed it, as well as both my parents. The mice love hearing the Fairy God Mother tell them the story of Cinderella, but when the story gets old, they go about writing more adventures. The first tells the story of Cinderella's first day as a Princess. The Prince has to leave already for something important, and leaves Cinderella to plan and host a big party for royalty only. They try to teach her how to be a princess and have many rules that Cinderella dosen't agree with, such as not allowing commoners into the castle. She then realizes that her Prince loves her for who she is and she adds her own style to the party. In the second story, Jaq decides he wants to be human to help Cinderella in return for all the nice things she does for the mice. But when the Fairy God Mother grants his wish, he finds that he liked being a mouse better. In the 3rd and final story, love is in the air! Lady Tremain decides that if her two daughters, Anastacia and Drisella, aren't good enough for a prince, she'll fix them up with a duke or someone noble. But Anastacia falls in love with a baker wich is unacceptable to her mother. With the help of Cinderella, she'll win the heart of the baker and stand up to her mother! The last story is my favorite. Lucifer also falls in love with the cat from the castle, Pon Pon. While non of the characters sing a song(except for the Fairy God Mother sings ""Bibidi Bobidi Boo""), teen pop star Brooke Allison sings 4 songs wich sort of help narrate the storys. They are good songs that my family found their toes tapping to! If you loved the original like my family did, you'll love the sequel!",1014681600,4,1813,4.288629737609329
