8268254,4,6304913907,"This really farout movie has great dialogue and good gore and dark humor. It seems visually uneven, as mentioned on other posts, but it doesn'y really distract me much. Good effects though, all fairly realistic. Not quite sure what the intent of the film is, but it sure is a wild ride, full of characters that will stay with you. It's like it says, Texas Chainsaw meets Pulp Fiction, but there is so much going on, that seems almost too easy of a description.
I love the monster at the end!",982368000,,491,4.406593406593407
8268255,5,6304913907,"Dead Things is a very good effort put forth by ""The Prince Of Gore"" Todd Sheets. It is about two drug dealers that get turned in by one of there clients. On there way to prison, they meet two other  prisoners. They escape, killing the driver and taking the van to one of the  prisoner's uncle's houses. They run out of gas and start walking. One of  the prisoners has to go to the bathroom, so he goes behind a tree then he  gets caught by a backwoods redneck. The other prisoners get caught by two  cops and they run into some backwoods rednecks. They all get into a fight  and the rednecks take them to there old farm house. After killing all but  two of the prisoners/cops, the rednecks take the two remaining men to an  old shed and tie them up. The rednecks then bring death to them and they  turn into demons. The two men get loose and fight the rednecks, some farmer  zombies and DEATH himself! The two men, after getting the crap beaten out  of them, kill death by destroying his heart. The demons and the zombies  then start melting and die. The two men then leave the house and walk away.  This film has some great effects and an awesome story. The film has alot of  gore effects, like a man getting stabbed in the hand, a man getting gutted  and a guy getting his foot sawed in half. At the end Todd, with the help of  Brian Eklund, created a magnificent computer effects sequence. Director  Todd Sheets made this film on a small budget for fun, but the end result is  very satisfactory. I would recomend this film to any ""TRUE""  Horror fan.
A very good film,  Dave Williams: writer,  director",927158400,2,1604,4.315436241610739
