8297271,4,B001EAWMAG,"This title presents the Gospel of Antichrist in a greatly true yet sort of 1 dimensional lie. For those of us who have been made knowledgeable in the word of God, we know that one of Satan's biggest lies in telling people that they can be as God (through disobeying God), others Satan has told that they are God and still that other that they can become God. This family of deceptions brought the first sin into the world and therefore I give this great extraction of the point 4 stars; I lacked to give it five stars because it does not tell about the other popular lies that Satan and Antichrist are marketing to froward souls to turn them even more against God: Satan has told some this is heaven and it doesn't get any better than here on earth and so live it up now and forsake Christ and His doctrine while telling others an equally destructive heresy---that this life on earth is hell itself and therefore cannot get any worse. Then there is the growing movement of preaching distorted versions of Jesus Christ: The Jesus Who Came So We Could Live In Luxury; Santa Clause Jesus: Who like a genie lived (and died and rose again)so that our every earthly wish could be filled. Then there is the Jesus Christ who was not the Christ come in the flesh, who was not the Son of God nor the Savior of the World, but rather a good teacher and prophet of God only and nothing more---NONE OF THOSE JESUS SAVES ANYONE FOR THEY CANNOT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE JESUS CHRIST OF THE BIBLE-JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE SON OF GOD, THE CHRIST COME IN THE FLESH,THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD. But nonetheless, for the one angle of Antichrist's gospel that was covered: it did its job; this was made back in the 90s and it is seem just as relevant 20 years later. This is worth adding to collection definitely!",1379894400,5,1785,4.379518072289157
8297272,5,B001EAWMAG,This documentary was very well done and gives a very good thorough overview of how the Bible speaks of this coming world leader with perfect examples of how society today is being prepared for his emergence. I strongly recommend it to Christians or anyone wanting to understand the truth about this coming world leader.,1335312000,3,319,4.925925925925926
