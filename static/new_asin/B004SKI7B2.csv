4463325,4,B004SKI7B2,"I knew eventually a movie about the legendary Danny Greene will come out, and this was nicely done with a great cast. Im sure you know the true story by now - a ballsy Irish-American thug in 1970s Cleveland tests the Mafia to the limits with brazen acts of defiance, a time when the Cleveland Mafia often preferred car-bombs instead of guns. Ray Stevenson is a fine choice for Greene, Kilmer lights up the screen as the detective on the case (and semi-friend; who's well aware of Greene's inevitable fate), and D'Onofrio is terrific as low-level hood John Nardi. Excellent usage of real-life news footage of the events transpiring and the Celtic bagpipe backround tune is a true pleasure as well. A few thoughts:

-Sorvino was a nice choice for Fat Tony Salerno of the Genovese Family but he should have been chewing a cigar in almost every scene, Salerno was notorious for this.

-They should have showed more of the relationship between Greene and Jewish loanshark Shonder Birns (Walken), as this is how Greene really made his mark in the underworld. They missed alot of this but hey it is a 2 hour film.

Other than a few minor flaws, this slick little mobster film is very entertaining and gangster fans especially will be glued to the screen. 4 Stars for Kill The Irishman.",1308096000,12,1278,4.671111111111111
4463326,5,B004SKI7B2,"I thought this was an excellent movie. Ray Stevenson was very compelling in the title role. Everyone else has described the movie in detail, so I'll just advise you to watch it.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1308096000,,216,4.684210526315789
4463327,4,B004SKI7B2,"I saw two movies during the past 2 nights.  The first, ""Battle Los Angeles"" was a fun, testosterone filled bloodbath, I will admit was ejoyable enough to keep one in his or her seat (well, ""his"" seat anyway.  That piece of entertainment cost about +/- $70,000,000 to create.  It was fun as I said but I developed no emotional attachment to the charaters, the plight of humanity in the face of such an overwhelming force (consider here your attachment to Rocky, or the Rebel Alliance) and when said and done, was just a fun movie to see once, maybe again later on when you forget how it ends.

""Kill the Irishman"", and indie-pic probably made in the single-digit millions, had outstandig acting with Ray Stevenson showing some emmotional range, Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken as an antagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio and an actor who continues to grow, Val Kilmer; along with the usual stable of Italian mafia character actors.  I became involved in rooting for this anti-hero and without giving too much away, wanted to reach out a hand to help him on his life's path.

Absolutely engrossing, it is amazing, both films released the same day on DVD, one promoted heavily on TV, the other overlooked even when doing an internet search for ""New DVD's this week"".  5-10 years from now, one will be a cult-classic, the other will be all but forgotten.  LEt me tell you, it won't be the $70,000,000 picture that profited in the long run.

If it happened in Boston it would be up there with the greats, somethingn about the Irish anywhere else lacks a little something, perhaps I am just bias.  Nevertheless, seldom is a film worth 4 out of 5 stars and if possible I would give it 4.5/5.

""Kill the Irishman"" based on a true story, will not be a waste of your time or money. Slainte'",1308096000,3,1788,4.6265822784810124
4463328,4,B004SKI7B2,"""If any of these maggots from the so-called mafia want to come after me, I'm not a hard man to find.""  This is the true story of Danny Greene (Stevenson), the man the mob couldn't kill.  After an encounter with loan shark Shondor Birns (Walken) ends badly, a $25,000 price is put on his head.  The mafia tries everything they can think of, but Danny will not go down without a fight.  Being a huge fan of mafia movies, I was really looking forward to this one.  While the movie is very good and entertaining, I was a little dissapointed.  The movie seemed to never keep up a steady pace.  Some parts moved very quick and were fun to watch, then the next scene slowed it way down and didn't seem to have any impact.  The cast however, makes this movie.  There are too many stars to list here but there are about ten known actors that really make this movie as good as it is.  If the cast was not what it was this would have been a really bad B movie, but as it stands it is a very entertaining movie to watch.  On a side note Val Kilmer is not embarassing to watch in this (unlike is last 4 or 5 movies).  Overall a very good movie, but a tad dissapointing. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I think I would.",1307836800,4,1212,4.042016806722689
4463329,4,B004SKI7B2,"Danny Greene is a poor Irish orphan who grows up to become a gritty union leader at odds with and in cahoots with the local Mafia. Ray Stevenson does an excellent job portraying Danny Greene while Val Kilmer was less than spectacular as the detective investigating him. Perhaps the writers didn't know what personality to give Kilmer, so they left it out. In spite of Danny Greene's criminal exploits, we have empathy for him. Danny is both tough and smart is spite of not completing high school. His blue collar rise to the top gives us the bad guy ""walking tall"" feel.

Once Danny is caught, things change. He makes a deal to stay out of prison by becoming a snitch to the surprise of Val Kilmer, but he is not a very good snitch. In one scene, Danny decides to clean up his own neighborhood by going up against a local biker gang. His wife (Linda Cardellini) watches Danny beat up a biker in the street and she appears to be surprised at his actions after being married to the guy for several years, knowing he is a mobster. She is not supportive.

Danny is forced to do things he doesn't want to do, or at least that is how the film portrays Danny, as the kindly neighborhood bill collector, who only busts kneecaps when he has to. Good historical film without being a documentary.

Very brief sex, nudity, and f-bombs. Some course ethnic humor.",1306627200,4,1349,4.475609756097561
4463330,4,B004SKI7B2,"It's very seldom that I say that a particular movie would have benefited from a longer running time, but in the case of KILL THE IRISHMAN, I think that an additional thirty minutes would have turned what is now an entertaining gangster movie into a classic of the genre.

Written (with Jeremy Walters) and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh, KILL THE IRISHMAN is based on the true story of Danny Greene, an Irish-American thug, revered by his neighbors as a local ""Robin Hood,"" who in the 1970s, declared war on the Cleveland branch of the Italian Mafia.  Greene survived many assassination attempts and his bold efforts, ultimately, led to the collapse of the Mob syndicate throughout the United States.

Ray Stevenson is quite effective as the ""take no prisoners"" Danny Greene, and he is supported by an excellent cast that includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Paul Sorvino, Robert Davi and several other actors who are familiar faces in Mob movies.

The problem is that there are so many characters and so much plot, all fascinating, that are crammed into the movie's 106 minute running time that the film feels like an outline for a more extensive epic drama.  Great gangster movies (e.g. THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS) require texture and depth of characterization, while Hensleigh's picture presents the people who populate it with very broad strokes.

Yes, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that HBO or Showtime might have done this story more justice.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a compelling documentary about the real Danny Greene.

4463331,5,B004SKI7B2,"Usually I am not into gangster films.  The annoying trait, many of them possess, are the heroic portrayals of men who engaged in criminal behavior.  Often they are shown as people who had to do it, because they had a hard life.  I disagree.  They had a hard life because they chose a life of crime and all the drama that came with it is their fault.

In this movie, I found none of that.  Danny Greene, in this film, is not glamorized in any way.  The film just tells his story and it was very interesting.  There are alot of ups and downs in his life and it is his fault because he makes bad decisions.

The movie is about one hour and thirty-five minutes not counting the credits at the end.  The film moves by very fast and, because of its quick pace, one does not feel bored watching this film.  Even though the film is not that long, the character of Greene is well-explained.  He sometimes has too much pride and that causes him to get into a lot of unnecessary conflicts.  Ultimately, he pays a price for it.

The setting of the film adds to the flavor.  Everything, from the cars to the homes, looks rundown.  Overall, five stars for the movie.  Very entertaining and fun to watch.",1305590400,5,1189,4.283783783783784
4463332,4,B004SKI7B2,"i was in my twenties when danny green was finally killed. i drove by his dentist,s office frequently.  Located in affluent Lyndhust on the border of Beachwood, it was not the neighborhood any of us were expecting for this.  but we had been following the car bombs for years and it seemed like they would never end.  danny green, a local hero for many, was the one who ended it and he passed into local lore handed down from one generation to the next.  frankly it is unthinkable that anyone brought up here would not know his story.

the movie does a good job bringing Green to life with the lead actor being the best part of the film.  he could be danny green.  the supporting cast is good too although christopher walken does not remind me of shonder birns at all. vincent d,onforio does remind me of john nardi though. however, this isn,t a documentary so these are minor points.  in fact, what i want to see now is the documentary made in tandem with this by the same people.

i guess the reason this is four stars instead of more though is that i,ve been raised on all of the coppola and scorsese gangster films.  although this is good, it does not come up to their level.  after all of their gangster films, i am also tired of gangster films and can,t handle the violence as well as i used to handle it.

4463333,4,B004SKI7B2,"A tough Irishman challenges the authority of the Italian mobsters in Cleveland, thus making himself a target. A contract is put out on him, but he is difficult to take down. This is an effective gangster film that is quite violent, but the violence is not visually graphic. The action is intercut with actual news footage of the local media covering the events as they took place, which adds to the film's realism. The lead character is a domineering figure, but he is not a bully, and he is thus likeable. Some familiar faces from gangster films past appear in this one, bringing back memories of films like Goodfellas.  Though not quite at that level, Kill the Irishman is very solid entertainment that should not be missed.",1302393600,43,726,4.716535433070866

If you liked the Wire you'll enjoy this, but it is based upon a true life story of Danny Green, his life as a Longshoreman and a Mobster.

4463420,4,B004SKI7B2,"Interesting story with great characters.  I watched it a week ago and something kept gnawing at me and I could not pinpoint it until last night it all hit me after two bottles of cheap red wine. This film is a compilation of famous scenes from other gangster movies and it has to be intentional.  Here is a quick rundown in no particular order:
1.  Danny beats up an Italian guy in the street while his girlfriend watches.  Sound familiar.  Goodfellas had the same scene when Ray Liotta beats up a neighborhood kid while his girlfriend Karen, looked on.
2.  Fionnula Flanagan, playing the role of a tough old Irish broad, tells Danny off and orders him to get his hands off her fence.  She has that steely look in her eye that could melt iron.  Familiar?  It is Geraldine Page in The Pope Of Greenwich Village staring down two NYC detectives who are hell bent on searching her house.
3.  Danny's girlfriend, Laura Ramsey, comes on to him by exposing her breasts.  Ripoff of The Godfather with Michael Corleone and his new bride in Italy.
4.  Steve Schirripa yells at Danny for trying to kill him in front of his family.  This is a do over done on the cheap of The Godfather II where Michael Corleone goes ballistic after he is sprayed with bullets in his Las Vegas bedroom.
5.  The beginning of the movie has the same voice over effect as Goodfellas.
6.  The LA hit man murders an associate in LA by shooting him from the back seat of a car while he sits in the front.  This is the scene from Goodfellas where Maurie gets stabbed in the back of the neck by Joe Pesci.
7.  Paul Sorvino ponders investing in a cattle ranch.  He did not have to rehearse this scene much as it is the same as the scene in Goodfellas where he was offered an ownership interest in The Bamboo Cottage.
There are probably more copycat scenes but I would need to watch it a second or third time.  But you get the drift.",1492646400,,1893,4.326704545454546

4463514,3,B004SKI7B2,"With the popularity and success of mafia films, lesser known, true stories have to come to light, and I tend to enjoy them the most. Everybody knows about Gotti, Capone, and Bulger, but how many people know about Danny Greene? Greene was a simple factory worker in Cleveland, Ohio, who was upset by how mob corruption had taken over every major industry in the city. Greene wanted to fight back, but no one successfully takes on the mob, so Greene decided to hit them where it hurt. Greene started his own crew and slowly started to take over their businesses. For nearly a decade, the mob tried and failed to assassinate Greene, making him a modern day Bravehart in the hearts and minds of the citizens of Cleveland. Ray Stevenson, always ""that other guy"", stars in this film, and he was truly outstanding. People who knew Greene say Stevenson's performance was spot on and that really adds to the excitement surrounding this film. Kill The Irishman isn't without it's problems however, as with most mafia related films, it moves incredibly fast. It's hard to keep track of the timeline and as always, people come and go so quickly, that it's hard to keep track of who is who. Beyond that, this film focuses on the violence and assassination attempts surrounding Greene, rather than simply telling his story. The bottom line, Kill The Irishman is certainly not Goodfellas, but it was still extremely entertaining, and offers viewers a story about the mafia, that most wise guys would prefer to forget.",1451779200,,1502,4.803088803088803

There are not much gunshots like any other gangster films but more fist fights which is in this case more powerful and exciting.

This is the first time seeing him but instantly I fell in love.

4463524,4,B004SKI7B2,"Being from Cleveland it was a drag that this was filmed in Detroit, partly because Cleveland had gotten too upscale by 2010 and also because Detroit besides looking more down and out gave them a better deal.
My father knew Shondor Birns and I met him in my youth and Walken's brief appearance as a Jewish mobster was amusing. The Theatrical Restaurant on Short Vincent in downtown Cleveland is featured and I used to go there with my father. That is where I met Mr Birns.
The movie was fun to watch. A lot of cars with people inside get blown up.
Typical misleading movie poster.
I wanted more about Shondor Birns but the film stood up based on the life of Danny Greene who was blown up at a dentists office half way between my mothers home and my brothers. I have passed it many times.
In the film it is not in the parking lot of a suburban Cleveland office building off of an interstate but rather in a run down downtown Detroit parking lot. That was disappointing.
Best of all was Vincent D'Onofrio as John Nardi. Mr Nardi was, of course, blown up in a car bombing.
But before that he was Danny Greene's Italian mafia friend.
It should have been filmed in Cleveland.",1445558400,,1169,4.391705069124424

Even though there is a bit violence in this film, it could never compare to what was actually there in Ohio during Danny's time on earth. The  biography To Kill The Irishman: The War that Crippled the
Mafia (1998), written by Rick Porrello a retired Cleveland  Police Detective  is the basis for this film that is loosely based on his life. Danny never claimed to be a saint as he himself admittedly wined, dined & danced with the devil himself  (which no doubt led to his early demise) the amazing factor  is how long he did survive. His only redeeming  value was how he looked  after his neighbors, the elderly and orphans in his community.

Not on par with goodfellas or other Scorsese/De Palma films that are shining exemplars of the genre but as close as you can come with a limited budget.  I won't get into all the actors in the film but there are a lot of familiar faces especially for fans of Sopranos and again the Scorsese films.,1412380800,,422,4.275
4463598,4,B004SKI7B2,"There are a few things that drew me to Kill the Irishman - my interest in organized crime films in general, the fact that I am of Irish (and Italian, as it were) ancestry, Ray Stevensons moustache in this movie, but most of all Ray Stevenson himself. Ever since watching him as Titus Pullo on the HBO show Rome, he has been one of my favorite actors hands down - very few actors have the impeccable ability to handle ""tough guy"" roles with an inherent vulnerability like Stevenson most effectively did on Rome. Unfortunately, the most of the rest of his filmography is less than stellar, though I will say I very much enjoy Punisher: War Zone from a B movie perspective. However, I was seeing some good things about his performance in this movie I had seen advertised a few years back, Kill the Irishman, which appeared to have been a direct to DVD release. After taking a look at the trailer and loving it, I knew I needed to see this movie, and was very eager to get my hands on it.

When I did, I wasn't disappointed, despite the fact that Kill the Irishman is admittedly not a great film. Some of it is simply due to the apparently small budget of the film, but certain scenes can be a bit hokey, albeit not so much in a poorly made, cringeworthy way so much as in a B action movie sort of way, which is fine on its own. Except that I was expecting this to be more of a B action movie, when in reality, when the film buckles down and takes its surprisingly more serious dramatic turns it does them very well. The final scenes of the film in particular had me near tears, which I was not expecting at all from this film, and are a further testament to the tough yet vulnerable type characters Stevenson plays exemplary, and his performance as Danny Greene here is no exception. As cold blooded as Danny can be in his work, you really get the impression from this he was a good man outside of it, who cared for the people around him and a certain unique, distinctly Irish persona that drew people to him. I found myself rooting for Danny even when I probably shouldn't have been, so as always, Stevenson won me over here.

The rest of the cast does well enough, though Val Kilmer in particular seems to have phoned in his role. But for the quality of Ray Stevensons acting, his character, the storyline, the action packed moments and not least of all the music - an eclectic mix of traditional Irish music and rock and pop music of the time periods - this movie is worth a watch. It's not perfect, but in an era of films bloated by overuse of CGI and forgettable plot and characters, Kill the Irishman has a distinctly old school feel to it that will surely satisfy fans of action and crime films, and even moreso, fans of Ray Stevenson who would like to see him in a good movie for a change.",1411862400,4,2794,4.309885931558935

4463604,3,B004SKI7B2,"Ah, the age old question: How many people can you blow up in a film before it becomes gratuitous? Kill
the Irishman tells the true story of Daniel Greene (played by Ray Stevenson), an Irish dock worker who
becomes union boss, then thug, then even worse thug. Stevenson executes the role of sinner/saint,
which is I guess how director Jonathan Hensleigh wants us to see Greene. Sure, maybe the word
executes isn't the best choice.
I didn't want to report in this review that this film is just another mob movie. Well, it is but its maybe a
notch above most mobster films. Greene rose to power in the 1970s, and the film captures the feel of
the 70s mostly through cars. Then, those cars are blown up, along with a great supporting cast namely
Christopher Walken, Vincent Donofrio (from Law and Order fame). Yep. All blown up. Does anyone
remember Second City TV, when John Candy was one of the performers (this goes way back)? There was
a skit where two hicks review moviesand they give the best reviews to those films where things
blowed up real good. This film would have won their equivalent to an Academy Award.
Val Kilmer plays Joe Manditski, the cop after Greene. I would say hes chasing Greene in the film, but
sheesh I don't think Val Kilmer is chasing anyone these days. And I thought Vincent Donofrio let himself
go. What happened to this sexy, trim actor who turned on audiences as the lead in Batman Forever
(1995) and in The Doors (1991) lead singer Jim Morrison? Could it be he wasn't getting the sexy roles
anymore? Like the lead in The Ten Commandments: The Musical (2006, really look it up; Im not
kidding).
Okay, now I really feel bad because of what I said about Val Kilmer. I hope this is the turnaround role for
him, really. On second thought, its not going to be. His part is (like most of the roles in this film) a
stereotype. This movie reminds me of The American (2009) with George Clooneyyou want it to be so
much better. Admittedly, Kill the Irishman gets a little closer to its mark than the Clooney film, but in the
end not by much.",1408406400,,2060,4.4668435013262595

Boom, boom, boom. All these characters are depicted extremely well in the video.  Only complaint, the Cleveland PD cars look nothing like the time period.

There are some great actors (Christopher Walken; Vincent D'Onofrio) but in among them - in fact standing in front of them, is a curiously flat and uncharismatic performance by the leading man. maybe it's not his fault. the script is terse without being tight, and leaves a lot of ponderous one liners which sometimes sound ridiculous. I mean, if you had just narrowly survived a car bomb, would you stand up in the middle of the street and yell'It'll take more than that to kill the Irishman'? Possibly not. It's this constant straining at clich and bombast which draws away any sympathy we might feel and hence engagement with) this rowdy Irishman with a heart of gold. In the end, it's as if (exactly as if...) we are watching another dead re-run of Italian American mafia but with 'Italian' hastily crossed out and 'Irish' scribbled in. Oops. It also looks as though the producers' idea of 1970s Cleveland was to lock of streets and hire some old cars. the city looks almost deserted (because ONLY film vehicles are visible) and ditto with the period clothes. It's one big stage production set in an empty town. Lacks atmosphere, but mostly there's no reason to become interested in this minor variation (but a true story...) of mob dynamics.

As a Clevelander, however, I was disappointed at the picture painted of the city and the places depicted in the movie.  The movie was not shot in Cleveland and certain of the places depicted--inevitably appearing dark, grungy, dirty--bore no resemblance to reality.  The Theatrical Bar was located in the center of downtown, on a street called Short Vincent.  On any night, you could--as discussed in the movie--see the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Mickey Mantle (as well as any other sports figure in town to play the Cleveland teams), George Steinbrenner (a Clevelander before he and some of his Cleveland buddies bought the Yankees in 1970), and other representatives of media, government, sports.  And Runyon-esqe crime figures.  It was large place with Fifties type decor, a huge circular bar (with reserved seats) and tables along the walls where they served a high end dinner.  In the movie, it is depicted as a seedy corner bar that Marilyn Monroe would not have been caught dead in.  The parking lot in which Danny Greene was killed was not adjacent to a weary-looking four story building in a seedy neighborhood, but instead a modern, high rise professional building located in an upscale suburban city about 10 miles south of Greene's home, and the dental office he visited catered to a wealthy clientele,  The building and parking lot were about quarter mile away from one of the most exclusive and upscale shopping centers in the Midwest:  Beachwood Place.  While Danny Greene's house and domain were in a blue-collar neighborhood of Collinwood, he lived on the main drag of Waterloo Road, which is known as a center for music and arts.

If you are going to be true to the story, be true to the town that is part of it.  And shoot the movie in Cleveland, and not in Detroit.",1374883200,,1926,4.782477341389728

4463669,4,B004SKI7B2,"First of all, this is not The Godfather"" we're talking about here. Still, ""Kill the Irishman,"" is an entertaining flick about the criminal life of Danny Green, a self-proclaimed ""Celtic Warrior,"" who terrorized Cleveland in the 1960's and 1970's by bombing his enemies into oblivion. Of course, when you live by the bomb, you die by the bomb, and that's exactly what happened to Greene.

Irish actor, Ray Stevenson, is believable and Celtic bold playing the part of Greene. However, the special parts of the movie take place when veteran actors Christopher Walken, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Paul Sorvino fill the screen, performing their acting quirks, which are almost un-duplicable. Val Kilmer is insipid as Greene old pal, turned cop, and I wonder if his character in the movie was necessary in the first place. There's also a nice turn by Robert Davi, as the hitman who finally outsmarts Greene and sends Greene to the Celtic Warrior in the Sky Club.

This is an enjoyable movie for all mob movie fans. It's just not a great movie. There's too much ""Celtic Warrior"" drivel, which if actually true, makes Danny Green more of an oddball than a real tough guy in the mold of the Mafia men he detests.[...]",1368662400,,1203,4.806763285024155

4463691,3,B004SKI7B2,"""Kill the Irishman"" chronicles the life of Danny Greene, a 1970s Cleveland mobster played by Ray Stevenson. Directed by Jonathan Hensleigh (""The Punisher""), the film is most notable for the cast including Linda Cardellini, Robert Davi, Vincent D'Onofrio, Fionnula Flanagan, Vinnie Jones, Val Kilmer, Laura Ramsey, Paul Sorvino and Christopher Walken, as well as the preferred method of dispatching a victim: car bombing.

Ray Stevenson is credible as Danny Greene, tough and fearless ""Irishman,"" thanks to his fine performance, but the story that follows his rise and fall in the Cleveland crime scene needs improvement, being spotty and unfocused. Its capable actors and nice period details aside, the biopic feels less engaging than it should, trying to cover too much.

""Kill the Irishman"" feels rushed, with several major events (including deaths) that are described in an uninvolving way. Take Christopher Walken's role, Alex ""Shondor"" Birns, for example. Danny Greene's relationship with this night club owner sours quickly when $75,000 from a New York crime family is lost. The episode and what follows the subsequent dispute over the loan between the two, which I think require more detailed narrative, unfold too fast, leaving us with a feeling ""Is that all?""

I am a big Christopher Walken fan and my complaint has to do with the fact the filmmakers assembled a great cast of players all ready to show what they can do, and hardly give them chances. Considering the interesting subject matter and the impressive names of the players, ""Kill the Irishman"" is a great missed opportunity.",1356048000,2,1594,5.21875

Here's one that transcends the arc and is high-paced, powerful, memorable and well-acted with an anti-hero lead you can root for.

""Kill The Irishman"" is a fact-based story about Cleveland roughneck, union leader and mobster Danny Greene, played well by real-life lookalike Ray Stevenson, and the turf war he ignited with the Cleveland and New York Italian mafia over a loan gone bad. This movie has just about everything any man wants in a male fantasy: lots of tough talk, explosions, mayhem, killing, overflowing glands and even a sex scene with a beautiful dame. I found this movie an oasis in the ocean of bad mobster movies I am daily presented with on my 250-channel dish offering.

The flick include newsreels from the 1970s, the era when the greatest action took place, that verify what really happened and even splices a piece of film showing the real Danny Green so you can tell Stevenson really was his look-alike.

Filmed in subdued colors, rich ethnic locations, period music (blaring soul tunes blended with soft Celtic folk music)I was reminded of the stark and gritty Martin Scorcesse films that have shown the many sides of Mobsters and their minions; I found Ray Stevenson's portrayal of Danny Green riveting, compelling, almost romantic in his fearless yet fatal belief that he was a Celtic Warrior reincarnated.....alas, we are but mortals..........",1344902400,,700,5.185840707964601

Some other recognizable gangster actors are in it, all in good form. It is a violent movie, disturbing in a couple spots, but never gratuitous. The soundtrack kicks a**: Irish traditionals, fast-n-funky 70's soul, buzzy guitars - fun tunes that fit the action in the movie. Sure, the movie could have been longer, or had more plot/character development - but that's a sign of a good movie I guess, that you want more of it.

There were a few things that bothered me about the movie.  I never felt very sympathetic toward the main character, Danny Green.  Maybe it was the actor who played him or maybe it was the directing, but at any rate, the character came across as flat and almost uninteresting.  He also looked old and shaggy throughout the movie even when he was supposed to be younger.  Despite my aversion to violence, I did enjoy the scene where he runs the motorcycle gang out of the neighborhood. Too many things in the movie seemed unexplained to me.  His relationship with the young blonde girl seemed to missing something or perhaps too many cuts were made before the movie was released.  I kept asking my husband if I missed something.  Well, if there were missing pieces it didn't bother my husband at all.  By mid-movie, it was down to a body count as car bomb after car bomb wipes out various members of the Mafia.  Most of the scenes I could predict what would happen based on having watched ""The Godfather"" so many times.  Not a bad movie, but not memorable either.",1336780800,,1233,4.504504504504505

4463728,4,B004SKI7B2,"It's been a long while ago now that I recall catching something on perhaps the History Channel about the Cleveland bombings and Danny Greene and being quite intrigued by it. When I saw that KILL THE IRISHMAN was about Greene I couldn't pass up checking it out. (Somehow it seems timely that St. Patrick's Day is just a week away, no?)

I cannot vouch for the historical accuracy of the film itself but as a gangster movie it's interesting. It isn't often that you see the Italian Mafia getting taken-on by anyone, let alone an orphaned Irish-American with great ambition. The story of Danny Greene, as portrayed here in the film, is pretty fascinating. The man just had no fear! I was really pleased that though he did good things for his community he wasn't truly portrayed as a good guy forced to do bad things. Greene's ambition and intellect served him well doing a lot of really bad things with seemingly no remorse.

Unfortunately, I really can't say much for the acting in this film. Lots of well knowns but not one stood out as acting to their potential, perhaps that was exactly the point but as a bit of a nerd for that I was disappointed. What did really stand out was the dialog. Lots of great lines but what would a ganster movie be without a few of those?

Should you decide to give this flick a try I highly recommend checking out the documentary ""Danny Greene: The Rise and Fall of the Irishman"" which is the bonus material for the DVD. It put a lot of context onto the story of Greene and includes interviews with many of the people portrayed in the film. It was actually, in my humble opinion, the best part of this DVD. Though I can't say I loved this film, I very much enjoyed it and think anyone with Irish-American roots in particular that shares Danny's fascination with their Celtic heritage will find his story one worth watching.",1331424000,,1855,4.498516320474778

4463730,4,B004SKI7B2,"I had pretty low expectations for Kill the Irishman. When I saw that Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio were in it, I figured this would be a mediocre film too reliant on a couple of washed up actors to be any good. Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting

Kill the Irishman follows the story of Danny Greene, a hotshot criminal working his way up in the Cleveland mob. Greene is different from your average mob movie protagonist. He's not a nice guy by any means, but he has a certain charm about him which made him appealing to me. Ray Stevenson, despite lacking star power, is actually the most credible actor in the movie.

Kill the Irishman isn't the most exciting movie I've ever watched, but it was a pretty entertaining movie. It's a tad over the top at times (Christopher Walken has a tendency to have that effect), but that's almost to be expected.

Kill the Irishman won't go down as a mob movie classic, but it also won't be remembered as a complete turkey either. If you're from Cleveland or just a fan of mob movies, you should give it a shot. There are definitely worse movies to spend an evening watching.",1331251200,,1127,4.434782608695652

You can compare this film to some of the old mobster classics we all love and it will surely fail in most comparisons but I really feel like this movie is a classic in its own right and hopefully over time it will be known as such.
 Everybody cast in this film does a wonderful job. They all seem to flesh out their characters and make the viewer see them as real people not just cardboard cutouts there to move the thing along. Ray Stevenson is one hell of an actor, he takes the role of Danny Greene and basically just transforms into the man himself on film.
 If you like gangster/mobster films or just solid entertaining films in general you should give this a shot.",1329868800,,837,4.160493827160494
4463733,4,B004SKI7B2,"While ""Goodfellas"" remains the best mafia film I've seen,
""Kill the Irishman"" ranks up there as a very solid flick that based on my reading of the real Danny Greene's Wikipedia page seems to reasonably correspond with his actual life.  The movie is lifted by the presence of an outstanding supporting cast including Christopher Walken and Paul Sorvino (both playing gangster roles they could do in their sleep).

The movie certainly doesn't romanticize mob life like the Godfather Trilogy, but rather it presents the organized crime scene in Cleveland as a definitely blue collar environment where people were willing to killing each over significant sums of money but hardly what we'd consider to be bling-bling in the 21st century.

The movie also presents its violence in a very matter of fact and non-stylized fashion that I think lends authenticity to the film as does the use of news footage from that era (where bombs were going off so much some people dubbed Cleveland the bomb capital of the USA).

The only reason why I can't bring myself to give ""Kill the Irishman"" a five star rating is that near the end of the movie, the tone does sort of set up Danny Greene to be some sort of tragic heroic figure.  I have no doubt that he was  very charismatic and did do some good (albeit probably more for tactical and practical reasons).  However, the real Danny Greene was someone who killed people (admittedly most of them gangsters) and beat innocent people and coerced them into joining mobbed up unions.  So the playing of melancholy pipes at the end of the movie as the credits rolled as if the world had lost something when Greene died was a bit much.  Also, while Robert Davi is another great character, I found his behavior as Greene's ultimate nemesis a bit unbelievable.

But overall, this is a very good movie and organized crime buffs almost certainly would enjoy it.",1329609600,,1883,4.748466257668712

4463735,4,B004SKI7B2,"Set in Cleveland during the 1970's, this film from director Jonathan Hensleigh (`The Punisher' series) tells the true -ish story of Danny Greene. He was an impoverished second generation Irish man, but in America the apple never falls far from the tree, so he is still considered to be Irish - hence the title. I am second generation Irish, but feel totally English except that I do better singing when intoxicated (it's in the genes apparently). Any hoo, Danny (Ray Stevenson) is a big man with big ideas and a streak of pride that garners him admiration and the enmity of people in equal measure.

He starts on the docks and soon becomes the spokesman for the Longshoreman; his unofficial role soon becomes bona fide when he unceremoniously ousts the corrupt Union Boss. However, the power soon gets to him, actually before the paint has dried on his new green stairway. His carefree attitude towards other peoples' property soon gains him the attention of the mafia. As per usual everyone wants a split. Danny meanwhile gets busted and has to start all over.

This is a hard and gritty tale that uses some of the news reels from the time and it is amazing how many bombs were detonated around this time, like a microcosm of Beirut. Danny seems to have nine lives and a fear of no-one, it all builds up a head of steam that sees him upsetting one person too many and then all hell kicks off.

This is a well made and acted film that sadly went straight to DVD, well who wants to go to the cinema anyway? Apart from lots of people with their money that is. Besides that this ticks all the boxes, there is a love interest, there are some famous names, like Val Kilmer as the good cop who put his badge first. The nasty crime boss, Shonder Birns played by Christoher Walken and loads of proper unchoreographed action. There is also great period detail with some fantastic old American cars, that all too frequently end up in a failed bid to reach outerspace thanks to the addition of some explosives. There is also Vinny Jones who does for the Irish accent what Dick van Dyke did for Cockneys, but he is quite likeable despite that.

All in all a well made and paced film and at 101 minutes is perfectly timed too, the music is good also; there is so much to like here that if gangster type films is your thing, then it would be churlish not to give it a go - recommended.",1326326400,2,2371,4.44367816091954

He used to come into the bar my girlfriend worked at and people treated him like a mayor. He was nice guy, but very rugged and the movie does a great job showing his different personality's. The movie wasn't filmed in Cleveland but it looks a lot like the city in those days with the back alleys, empty playgrounds, the docks and waters, and the bikers and other people in Cleveland at that time. The city was alive then and people were making money all over the place. The actor look and acts just like Danny, so it's a must see!. And if your homegrown in Cleveland, you'll really apreciate the film. Those car bombings were no joke at the time, and nobody was getting a ride from people they didn't know cause you didn't know whose car was going to blow up next.

The weird thing is that I can't come on here and write a review and talk about this actor or actress.  To me, all the actors and writers came together to tell me a story.  A very cool story that I enjoyed a lot.  Did one person stand out over the other?  Any Emmy nominations?  No.

4463744,4,B004SKI7B2,"Ray Stevenson is well-known and well-adored by the devoted fans of HBO's star-crossed ""Rome"" series, which deserved a far greater audience than it received.  His heartfelt performance as a lovable, murderous lug may not have made him a box office star but did win him a dedicated following.

Apparently those select few were the only people to go see his leading man performance in ""Kill the Irishman,"" which opened on a whopping 5 screens.  Perhaps America is too focused on the Vegas-New York Mafia axis, but we should appreciate that there are bad guys in other cities, too - and at one point Cleveland was a city worth fighting over.

Stevenson plays real-life gangster Danny Greene, a tough Irish criminal who worked his way up through the Cleveland mob with his unique combination of brains and brawn.  To his credit, Greene was also a racist son-of-a-gun who had contempt for anyone who wasn't Irish - that and he had a mean streak a mile wide.  But Stevenson can't help but be a lovable lug; the guy is a walking Little John.  And so it is that the audience instantly sides with Greene as he goes toe to toe with every mobster under the sun, even as he second-rates his wife.

""Kill the Irishman"" is far from a great film, but it is an enjoyable, gritty movie.  Grounded in realism, this is not another Tarantino riff on the gangster movie, but is instead a straight-up mob movie about the guys who wish they were as highbrow as the Corleones.  Problems are raised and solved as they often are in gangster movies - we tread no new ground here.  But there's a distinct pleasure in watching Jonathan Hensleigh's movie in that we get the sense that these are real people fighting real-world battles in a real-world city.  The capper, a brief home movie of the actual Danny Greene, is so eerily similar to Stevenson that it's easy to categorize ""Kill the Irishman"" as a documentary.

As a final comment, let me say that if Tom Cruise is allowed to play Jack Reacher in the upcoming ""One Shot,"" when Ray Stevenson is available and born to play the part, I am going to boycott Hollywood for a year.",1316044800,,2100,4.568

They actually show old news footage from the actual events from which this movie is based throughout the film to add to the feeling of authenticity. I was just a toddler when all of this was going down in real life, so the events were not known to me. However,it was an interesting look back at what essentially marked the end of the big time public figure mob boss era. The pacing wasn't very fast, the violence happened in the flow of the story, but wasn't the feature per se, even when bombs start exploding throughout Cleveland. Really, it was more of a biographical look at a popular folk hero/criminal whose death led to the incarceration of mob bosses from L.A. to New York. It's definitely worth a viewing, and there are some pretty funny moments to go along with all the sadness and serious business. As a side note, Vincent D'onofrio was great IMO, and The Irishman's love interests were bonafide hotties. Enjoy.",1315008000,,1091,4.628865979381444

They had a story and a cast on par with ""goodfellas"", but not a script at that level. The criminal-pov narration device that goodfellas used would also probably have improved the film (but admittedly would have also made it look derivative). Ray Stevenson puts in an excellent performance. Especially in the early union related scenes.

The biggest flaw in the script and the film is that it is too sentimental in its treatment of Danny Greene. These sorts of films are better when they can show both sides of this sort of character. They needed to make the point better that his behavior was often foolish and self-destructive. Val Kilmer's narration doesn't work well because its done alone from a outsider point of view within the story. Greene is the center of the script. Far too often friends and family come across as cyphers. And the hit-man who eventually kills Greene is too much of a terminator type robot character. Local mob guys go to New York. New York boss summons the terminator. Teminator ruthlessly stalks and kills.

It contains a long documentary, `Danny Greene: The Rise and Fall of the Irishman', which is very informative on the subject and really should be watched before the movie for better understanding, subtitles are available on the main feature, but not on the extras, which also includes the movie trailer. Some of the sound is not very good on the documentary, because of it being actual film from the event, subtitles would have been better.

There is of course violence and blood and a lot of fists used and bombs going off, oh yes and use of the f-word, resulting in the R rating.
It is an excellent account of actual events, fighting for control of Cleveland. Danny Greene is the Irishman trying to acquire control of mob activities for himself. He considers himself the heir to Celtic warriors and proves, at least for awhile he is indestructible.
There is an almost poignant flavor to the ending - the music, the last farewells, although that was not what they were known to be at the time.

You can relate to him and if you were in his shoes you may have been making the same decisions. This film has that underdog aspect.

As my title says and what doesn't make this a GREAT but still very good film was the part of Val Kilmer. Not only did it make me wonder what happened to him - as he looks like a bloated toad. His part and narration actually felt unnecessary. I could have honestly done without him in this movie.

I also have to admit upon reflection of this movie, we actually do have it better. It's much more subtle and unintended but gave me that same retrospective of Pleasantville. I don't believe in this day and age of the US you'd be able to put up with the amount of car bombs and explosions this movie had.

4463752,4,B004SKI7B2,"While I'm not normally a big fan of gangster films, I found this one a bit different. Sure, there are some stereotypical mob characters, but they're not overdone. Additionally, the movie is coming from a book (based on real life events) in Cleveland and includes archival footage -- so there's a bit of real life mixed in with the fiction. It's a good action drama with a moderate amount of violence -- not overdone, but just about right for a story of this type.

The main character, Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson), starts as a union boss and makes his way into organized crime. The storytelling moves along showing him try to move into something more ""normal"" -- until that no longer works and the violence starts as he becomes part of the mafia, despite his cozy plea bargain. As he gets involved in more and more of the world of crime and becomes a target himself, it is amazing how he stays fit both mentally and physically. The acting here is good, while at time pedestrian, still worthwhile. Other characters complement well, including the characters played by actors and Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio. Christopher Walken's role is small and fairly insignificant -- it would have been nicer to see him in a bigger role. Nonetheless, Stevenson is the star here.

I would say the movie could be broken up into thirds -- the first with deep character development, the second the actions of the mob, with the last more specifically on the final days of Danny Greene. The suspense is pretty good towards the end, and keeps you interested up to the final moments of the film. Overall recommended -- a good mix of history and some fun too.",1311638400,,1640,4.651724137931034

Greene is driving down the road in his car, pops a cassette tape into his dashboard player, and notices that the tape pops and hisses, sending out a small shower of sparks. With scant microseconds to spare, Greene rolls out of the moving vehicle as it explodes into a mass of flames.  Maybe I'm too easily entertained, but this grabbed my attention.

The rest of this true crime movie deals with Greene's rise from a hardscrabble Irish childhood in working class Cleveland (where he was regularly set upon and beaten by the local Sicilian kids, resulting in a lifelong hatred of Italians), to disgruntled dockworker, to corrupt union boss, to leg-breaker for a loan shark (played by Christopher Walken), to mobster and local hero in his Collinwood neighborhood. Oh, and along the way, he becomes an informant for the FBI. This guy was playing everybody in Cleveland and doing a fine job of it.  After the financing for a business deal goes sour, Greene has a falling out with the local Mafia thugs, and the car bombings begin.  Bodies are being blown to bits all over town, but Danny Greene is proving harder to kill than Rasputin.

This is a great story, ably told and well acted (I especially liked Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of John Nardi), and an entertaining way to pass a rainy (or sweltering) afternoon.  There's a documentary on the life of Danny Greene in the bonus features that is every bit as interesting as the movie.

I really liked the idea behind the film, and hoped to see it fleshed out in typical ""Goodfellas"" style. Unfortunately it just never quite reaches that level, and while entertaining, ""Kill the Irishman"" never differentiates itself from so many others in the genre. There are several elements introduced that I would have liked the film makers to explore further. The relationship between Danny and his wife, I would have liked to see more time spent on the Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken characters. As it played out, both were little more than extended cameos. I think the best part of the film was the relationship between Danny Greene and John Nardi (played by Vincent D'Onofrio).

One jarring aspect that really hurt the overall film was the execution of the car bombings. Because they are so important to the overall story, it's pretty obvious when fake CGI explosions occur. This pulls the viewer right out of the story and give the whole film a bad B-Movie feel.

I don't think I would recommend a purchase, but it's definately worth adding to your Netflix queue or checking out when it hits cable.",1311033600,,1287,4.840909090909091

Though he was an avid reader and an accomplished athlete, Danny dropped out of school and entered the world of Cleveland's organized crime.  He stole from the docks where he worked and muscled his way into becoming leader of the Longshoremen's Union.  Danny later joined forces with the Italian mobsters who controlled the garbage union.  Later, he organized his own Irish mob.  A mob war ensued, resulting in dozens of gangland assassinations, many of which involved car bombings.

  ""He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword"" was never truer than it is in director Jonathan Hensleigh's ""Kill the Irishman.""

I've read innumerable crime dramas and I've never come across anything as shocking and gritty as ""Kill the Irishman.""  This film is rife with mobsters, hit men, betrayals, car explosions, and brains being blown out by head shots.  The acting from all the leads is top notch and the sets and costumes made me feel as though I was a child once again living back in those crazy seventies when America was experiencing a cultural and spiritual revolution.

  The beautiful Irish music, the Celtic warrior legends, and the family-like camaraderie of Danny's friends all combined to make me teary eyed when I saw Danny and his friends slaughtered one-by-one at the hands of New York's Italian mobsters.  However, watching the DVD's documentary, ""Danny Greene: The Rise and Fall of the Irishman,"" made me realize that Daniel J. Greene was more evil than I had imagined and that he should have died sooner.  Yes, during the holidays Danny donated turkeys to the downtrodden and underprivileged of Cleveland, but he left many children orphans by blowing their fathers apart with homemade explosives.  Worst of all, Danny was an informant for the FBI, which was never mentioned in the film, ""Kill the Irishman.""  Being an informant kept Danny out of prison.  In my opinion, betraying your own kind is simply deplorable.

  The documentary was just as enjoyable to watch as the film.  It also supports the accuracy of the film.  Ray Stevenson (""Thor,"" ""The Book of Eli"" and ""Punisher: War Zone"") bore a striking resemblance to the real Daniel J. Greene, known as the Robin Hood of Collinwood.  Again, I must say, his portrayal was remarkable.  He was such a complex character and I couldn't help but wonder if he was evil because of his environment or he simply chose to become evil.  I believe he squandered his talents and gifts when he was tempted into leading a life of crime.  Nevertheless, the film depicts how much influence the media has on our perception of criminals.  Sometimes, they can help turn criminals into heroes or antiheroes.  I must also mention that Val Kilmer (""Heat"" and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") must've packed on some extra weight for his excellent portrayal of Detective Joe Manditski (based on the actual life of Cleveland Police Detective Ed Kovacic).

  Fans of bloody, violent, shocking crime drama and noir will definitely want to add ""Kill the Irishman"" to their DVD collections.  So will fans of true-life crimes.  Anchor Bay Entertainment did a great job of releasing it in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio with subtitles for the hearing impaired.  There is a theatrical trailer and the aforementioned documentary.  However, I was truly surprised to learn there are no deleted/extended scenes, no audio commentary and no making of featurettes.  All of these would have been appreciated by diehard fans of crime drama.  Nevertheless, this DVD is definitely worth the money and it the type of story that won't soon be forgotten.  The legend of Danny Greene will continue to live onward in the hearts of Collinwood residents for many generations.

""Kill the Irishman"" is a true story movie based on a man named Danny Greene that lived in Cleveland and his war on the mob in the 1970's. This story is absolutely true and the one of closest true story films I have. Danny was a Cleveland man of Irish decent who worked hard and didn't take anything form anybody. He was very proud of his heritage and really was into the Celtic Warriors of the past. So when the Italian Mob started in on him he started a war on them. His story is credited by all parties involved as the reason the Mob got taken down like they did.

The film starts with Danny [Ray Stevenson] working on the docks of Cleveland in some pretty hard manual labor situations. When a man passes out from the heat and dehydration the men stop because the heat level is way too dangerous. That of course what the Union rules say to do any way but the Union boss says other wise and says if you want to keep a job you keep working. This altercation leads to Danny finally deciding that these days of the Mob running every thing is over. Danny was elected president of the International Longshoremen's Association and started running things the way he saw fit. Of course being a kid from the streets and involved in crime any way he kept things running in that life style, during this time made a lot of people mad including Jimmy Hoffa.

From there we see when he lost the job due to the authorities cracking down on him. But it was also during this time that Danny strategically became an FBI informant. How could it be strategic one may ask, well because his sole purpose in life really was to bring down the Mob. So not only could he help the FBI do that but also as a protected informant he could up his criminal behavior without consequence. Greene started up his Mob of sorts called The Celtic Club which really was nothing more than an Irish Mafia. He would go on to plan or kill various Mob members and affiliates but at the same time work with an Italian named John Nardi. In this war with the Mafia Greene survived numerous assassination attempts including one that blew his house completely up while he was in it. This lead to Danny looking like the luck of the Irish was always on his side as it seemed he had nine lives like his pet cats.

During this time Danny became a legend as he went on every TV news station and called the country's biggest gang aka the Mafia out. He literally went on TV and said something like ""let me clear something else up. I didn't run away from the explosion. Someone said they saw me running away. I walked away."" He would also on TV call them out with ""I have no axe to grind, but if these maggots in this so-called Mafia want to come after me, I'm over here by the Celtic Club. I'm not hard to find."" Of course that only lasted so long because they eventually did get him and the ending of this film was excellent. His death lead to the arrest of all kinds of Mafia members and was the beginning of the end for the unchallenged rule the Mafia had at the time.

The film was great with an excellent script, director, and excellent actors. Ray Stevenson was the perfect choice to play Danny and he did an excellent job. Not only did he look like the guy but I believed he was this guy during the film. Christopher Walken as always is brilliant here as a loan shark that at first befriends Danny. Co star Val Kilmer feels like he is at his prime here as the real life Cleveland officer that befriended Danny. Vincent D'Onofrio was great as the Italian partner of Danny and of course Vinnie Jones is always great as he is here as Danny's main enforcer. The entire cast is great and I believed all of them as the characters they played. This film was produced by Tara Reid of all people but I assure you this is an excellent film. It also brings two Punishers together here as director Jonathan Hensleigh who directed the Thomas Jane starring ""Punisher"" film works with ""Punisher: War Zone"" star Ray Stevenson.

The DVD comes with an excellent documentary that is very detailed and in depth with the people that were there. It also shows the news footage of Danny calling out the Mob and talking about his house bombing and such. I highly recommend this film because it really is a good film. Well acted and paced and to top that off it is not only a Mob flick it is a true story movie. And you can say what you will but honestly who isn't interested in a good true story flick.",1310860800,3,4448,4.301909307875895
4463761,4,B004SKI7B2,"""Kill the Irishman"" is a disturbing film.  It's not that it is particularly violent, nor is it unrealistic, but rather implied violence is sometimes more impacting than direct.

Having said that, the story of Danny Greene is inspiring as well as well as intriguing.  In real life, in the 1970's, Mr Greene declared war on the Cleveland Italian Mafia with devastating results for the mob.  He survived, but the mob did not.

Starring Val Kilmer, Ray Stevenson, and Christopher Walken, ""KTI"" is deep with characterization and mob culture.  The writer, Jeremy Walters, does a very good job but just did not go the distance and fill for us viewers, who the characters are properly.  I loved the film, and think that, unlike some modern epics, it ran too short.

Walken, as always turns in an impeccable performance while Kilmer is slightly under the radar as a close 2nd for best performance in the film.

Add this to your gangster film collection, right beside Goodfellas, and Little Caesar.  Good films deserve good company.

You have a little bit of everything thrown in (Goodfellas, The Sopranos, Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Casino) along with a white washing of the life of Danny Greene (let's face it, the dude was a pompous and greedy guy who wanted the whole enchilada).  Many of the situations he was involved in (in the movie) felt very contrived and I felt the director tried to do too many things at once.  A lot of the actors it seemed were tossed into the production to give it some street creed.  Too bad the movie is average because the real life of Danny Greene is so interesting.

I really tried to like the movie but it's just okay.  IF you're looking for something to rent on a slow movie night then you'll want to pick this one up at a RedBox.",1310428800,,1001,4.292553191489362
4463764,5,B004SKI7B2,"Great movie from start to stop! Not only did it start off with a bang but it ended with an even bigger bang! Full of action and drama with characters that really spoke to you about what they believe in and are fighting for. For me this was not your typical gangster film for it was not all about killing and getting revenge on others but more about getting what should be rightfully yours.

Danny Greene might not have completed high school but that doesn't mean he is not educated. He reads the newspaper and congress letters to better himself and his people have a better life. He does make wrong choices but for the right reasons. He was a very likeable character and funny to watch his Tv cameos with the reporters. How many people can walk away without getting hurt when someone has tried to blow up your home, your car, and shot you more than 4 times? Danny Greene can!

The supporting cast including Christopher Walken & Val Kilmer help provide the icing on the cake for me in this film! They were wonderful characters, and Val Kilmer narrating was a nice touch to the story and a different perceptive for he plays the detective for Cleveland PD.

When it was all said and done it left me with a feeling of sadness for the mafia would never be the same without Danny Greene and if they would have just let him go to that cattle ranch maybe things would have been different.  But as it turns out things would never be the same for the mafia in Cleveland and you can thank the people who didn't see Danny Greene's way.

On another note, I don't remember seeing this film hit theaters. Did I miss it somewhere? I really enjoyed this film and would have loved to see it on the big screen. With so many BOOMS and so many laughs I have to recommend this film even if your not too much into gangsta films for this is not your typical film.",1310428800,,1839,4.303468208092486
4463765,3,B004SKI7B2,"With a cast like Ray Stevenson, Christopher Walken and Val Kilmer, you might automatically assume that ""Kill the Irishman"" is a top notch flick, but you'd be wrong. The script is a bit plodding, the acting by a good deal of the cast can be weak and it's hard to find anyone to root for in the film. Do you remember the antihero films of the 60s and 70s? This is a bit like those. That doesn't mean that the movie is bad, just that about fifteen to twenty minutes could have been cut from it to make it a tighter, more seamless film. As it stands, the film feels cluttered with padding in the same way films used to have stock footage back in the day.

Kill the Irishman does come with a documentary on the real Danny Greene that is an hour long and I actually preferred that to the fictionalized movie on his life. For me, it's not a good sign when a special feature overshadows the actual film, but this is one of those cases.  Personally, if you are interested in Danny Greene and the fall of the Cleveland Mafia, Rick Porello's book by the same name is a better investment of your time and money.",1310342400,,1099,4.228571428571429

Kill The Irishman,
Ray Stevenson, Vincent D'Orfrio, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken

The film, KILL THE IRISHMAN is based on the true story of Danny Greene, an Irish-American union mob figure, in Cleveland from the 1960's to the 1970s. Greene, who like many Public Relation's wise mobsters was often the local ""Robin Hood. Except that the tender side of Danny Greene was not about PR, it was about who he was. Greene's pride, quick thinking and fast fists and weapons, reacted and acted out of force of will, meeting and anticipating circumstances. His philosophy being a mix of Irish Catholicism and mythical superstition, born of archaic Irish Tribes, Septs and Clans. Greene responded to and declared war upon a branch of the Cleveland Mob which was aided, abetted and directed later by the New York ""GoodFellas"" gang. As the murders, bombings, stabbings and beatings rapidly progressed, we unfortunately, probably because of budget constraints, were given little time or background to know and assess most of the characters before they became a part of the carnage.

This was a far better than a middle of the road action, crime film. It had the quality of an Indy film, the stars of a Main Stream film and the fast action of a superhero film, but this seeming superhero was a real life person. The story is narrated by a police Lieutenant (Val Kilmer, looking Chubby and much like a character actor) who was a athletic colleague of Greene's in High school and somewhat of an admirer.

With a fearless and insistent warrior personality, Danny Greene, reminding one of a little of the approach taken by the Prophet David or Michael Corleone while taking his vows for God Father of his niece while his men are wiping out the opposition and the untrusted, but even more like Glenn Ford in western, The Violent Ones, in which Ford, like Danny Greene, becomes personally involved in the mayhem.

Over the summer of 1976, three dozen bombs devastated the heart of Cleveland as the substance of a war by the Mob over personalities, cash,  territories and ""business"".  It was Danny Greene and his pals pitted against not only the Cleveland Mafia, but the New York Mob as well. Danny Greene mete's out his brand of justice in a fast track rise from a tough Cleveland neighborhood guy with an old world brand of Justice, to become an enforcer in the local Mafia against the Main Stream Mob causing all Hell to break loose between the Mob, unions and independents as well.

Ray Stevenson was a knockdown, no holds barred, tough guy, as were all of those who surrounded him, and like a comic book super hero he seemed impossible to kill.

The acting was excellent, the direction was good, but the story line did lack a few details, which might have helped. However, the action moved so fast, that for the most part the few missing details seemed unnecessary. The pulling away, the often tenuous and then growing gap between him and his wife was very much unlike the loyalties of most Italian Mafia marriages. As far as sex goes; Greene's new girlfriend (Actress Laura Ramsey) after his failed marriage  was much more devoted than his wife, and had a higher tolerance for his sort of ""business."" Actress Laura Ramsey was also hot in an alluring a negligee' lovely breasts exposed as she is about to seduce Ray Stevenson's Danny Greene. There is also a brief scene of intercourse in an automobile with Greene's wife before their marriage, but little can be seen because they are partially clothed. In this film, the men's, tribal, clannishness, and violence, dominates center stage.

The film's atmosphere was dead-on, 1960'ws/1970's. The writers and director avoid the foolish, clich&eacute;' copy-cat trend of bopping back and forth from one unessential event to another, which lead to a wrapping of many films in a spiral of distractions and off subject sideshows, that add nothing to the plot of modern movies. Instead it does the right thing, the thing, which moves the movie along with no-nonsense lightening speed. Focusing completely on building tension and suspense and stick with what is at hand and paramount, is the right thing and makes for respectful kudos from movie-goers and writers/directors in the know.

Greene survived many assassination attempts and his bold efforts, ultimately, led to the collapse of the Cleveland Mob syndicate and their satellites throughout the United States.
Co-writer `s were Jeremy Walters, from the book by Rick Porrello who acted as executive producer of the movie, which was directed by Jonathan Hensleigh.

It is more than a bit violent, but not nearly as graphic as the savage and horrific displays of Criminal Minds blood, guts and worse programs and contains here and there a few moments of self-affacing humor.

While falling short of the Godfather series, it is certainly less graphic than GoodFellas.

It's obvious antecedent is Martin Scorsese's masterwork, ""Goodfellas"", but director Jonathan Hensleigh adds his own individual fluorishes that would excuse him from plagarism.  This film is crisply edited and the story is riveting. I love the way Hensleigh incorporates vintage newsreel footage into the narrative.  Hensleigh has assembled a top-notch cast in support of what should be a star-making turn by Ray Stevenson.  Stevenson's Danny Greene is as complex a character as you'll find in any film, an ambitious yet ultimately self-destructive powder keg of a man who somehow manages to squirm out of a series of predicaments of his own device.  It's doubtful Stevenson will be remembered at Oscar time but hope rings eternal.  After ""The Sopranos"" and some of Scorsese's work you would think the gangster terrain has been mined but ""Kill the Irishman"" debunks that theory.",1309651200,2,1100,5.140449438202247
4463771,5,B004SKI7B2,"This gritty, true story of Cleveland's Danny Greene, ""a man you don't meet every day,"" immediately grabbed my full attention, as this larger-than-life character leaps from an exploding car to taunt his would-be killers with, ""Is that the best you can do?!"" After such a dramatic opening, Kill The Irishman restarts the story of Danny Greene (played by Ray Stevenson) from his childhood days. Danny was raised by his grandfather, and grew up spending less time studying than fighting -- and when he fought, it was often with a large group of Sicilian boys who ganged up on him and another Irish boy, Joe Manditski (played by Val Kilmer).

Manditski grew up to be a police detective in the Cleveland PD, and his character's narration of this film provides fascinating insights into the twists and turns of Danny Greene's life as he ascends from dockworker to president of the longshoreman union, to gangster, and FBI informant.

Danny Greene's life was complex, yet this film focuses on the story of how he stood up to and posthumously triumphed over the Italian mafia in America. Whereas most gangsters in the 1970s acknowledged traditional ways of showing respect to the hierarchy of mafia families, Greene's audacious lack of respect for existing criminal organizations instantly made him a marked man. Ray Stevenson's portrayal of Greene is multidimensional, showing both a tender-hearted compassion toward friends and family, and cold-blooded ruthlessness toward those he considered in his way.

Some of the aspects of Danny Greene's life merely hinted at rather than explored in depth in this film included what and who inspired him to pursue a lifelong passion for self-improvement in body, mind, and spirit. Scenes of Danny taking daily jogs, doing sit-ups, reading books, and studying his Celtic roots don't fully explain what motivated him to become known as the ""Robin Hood of Collinwood,"" giving money and food to those in need, nor what drove him to be so well-informed when he spent so little time studying or even attending class as a school boy.

This DVD includes a fabulous hour-long documentary on Danny Greene and the Cleveland Car Bomb War of 1976, featuring interviews with Danny Greene's ex-wife, daughter, a mob attorney, and many others who survived that historic and horrific period in history.

The movie's style is influenced by the great gangster movies of the past too. the one one star review complains about this so ignore him, because this movie is gritty and realistic and it doesn't make greene into a hero really like gang rap does to modern thugs. To be honest we'd all be better off without one gangster on the whole planet, but still few stories of gang leaders are as spectacular as the rise and fall of the bloody danny greene. And to be honest , you can almost cheer him as his crew takes out the competition. Like all gang wars the police seem helpless until innocent people get killed. The hell's angel war in montreal was like that until a kid was blown up. But greene was a hundred times the man those guys were in spite of his being a murderer. This one is good historical movie and it sticks closely to the real story in many ways so that's a good thing. The acting is awesome too. The picture on blu ray looks fantastic as well it should this being a new movie. There is a documentary too about the real danny greene and that's disturbing as well. Especially the lawyer for the mobsters who laments all these nice people in the mob who went down for their crimes! He's so bad that he doesn't even realize it.
There are no deleted scenes but this one is for gangster movie fans as well as history buffs.

Did he do some bad things? Yep. But to what end? Only to preserve what he had worked so hard to obtain in his life.

I think I'll take the mafia any day.  If you didn't mess with them they left you alone.  The gangs today think it's fun to kill people just for the ""thrill"". You are not safe anywhere, so would Danny be proud that his death brought down the mafia all over the country and now we live with gangs running rampant?  Hard to say, but if Danny were still around, at least where ever he was there would be no gang activity.  He would make sure of that.  Watch the 1 hour documentary about Danny after the film.

Despite the low budget, Kill the Irishman manages to be a thoroughly compelling tale of a man who wouldn't back down.  Stevenson is good, and the ensemble supporting cast, which includes Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Vincent D'onofrio, Linda Cardellini, Bob Gunton, Paul Sorvino, Mike Starr, and Robert Davi among others, is great as well.  Even though the film is ultimately too brisk for its own good, and more often than not descends into the realm of mellodrama, in the end Kill the Irishman is a treat.  All in all, it isn't perfect, but for what it's worth, Kill the Irishman is wholeheartedly worth your time.",1309046400,,947,4.89375
4463779,4,B004SKI7B2,"Movies based on real life do both good and bad things. On the bad side they make us believe that everything we're witnessing is the bare facts laid out in cinematic style. On the good side they make us interested in a subject and hopefully look deeper into it rather than accept the film in blind faith. So it will be interesting to see what folks can learn about Danny Greene, the mobster and focus of the film KILL THE IRISHMAN.

Green (as played by Ray Stevenson) is a local tough guy who comes up the hard way. Picked on by the Italians in his neighborhood, the rough little Irish kid grows up taking his licks but dishing them out as well. He grows into a man and goes the physical labor route most do without an education. But Danny reads. He's tough and smart, a deadly combination.

When Danny's had enough of corrupt union leaders that care nothing for the men they represent, he takes on the local union boss and kicks him out. Now in charge of the union, Danny sets up shop and works with the Italian mob to steal from the loading docks he's in charge of. Along the way he picks up a wife, has a few kids and eventually gets charged with wrongdoing, losing his job.

Back on the streets and looking for work, he goes to work for Shondor Birns (Christopher Walken), a Jewish mobster/loan shark. Danny learns the ins and outs of the business eventually taking on his boss. With a contract on his head, Danny decided to fight fire with fire. If that wasn't enough, Danny also eventually takes on the Italian mob as well, daring them to take him out.

Looking into the truth behind the story you discover the numerous car bombings/deaths that took place in Cleveland when Danny Greene was around. Needless to say if you grew up in the 70s and in Danny's neighborhood, a bulletproof vest and a bunker in your house would have been a good investment. He was a violent man when called for but depicted here he had a soft side as well, helping people out at times. Then again he also dished out physical abuse for those late to the loan shark. So which side of Danny Greene is the real one? Only he knows.

The movie tells the tale in straight forward fashion, only using flashbacks when police detective and boyhood friend Joe Manditski (Val Kilmer) narrates. Kilmer's character is one that is torn between loyalties to his boyhood friend yet at the same time being a stand up cop enforcing the law. It's a narrow path to walk down but he does the best he can.

Stevenson is great here, depicting both sides of Greene and under laying the tough guy on the outside with the man who wants to help others as well. There always seems to be something simmering beneath that calm faade that Danny offers the public, a man of brute strength and unrepentant violence just waiting to be set free.

The entire cast does a great job here. Walken is underused but makes the best of his onscreen time. Vincent D'Onofrio as Greene's friend in the mob John Nardi comes off as a low level mob guy who shoots for the stars and rarely reaches the top floor of the nearby buildings. Tony Lobianco turns in a fine performance of the local head of the mob in Cleveland who ends up getting help from big time New York boss Paul Sorvino.

One of the best things included in this DVD is a short documentary about the real Danny Greene. Archive footage of Greene daring the mob to come get him, pictures of his life and times all blend to make this man interesting and at the same time show him for what he was, a low level mobster who attempted to paint a better image of himself than the actual life he led.

This is a well made movie, one that entertains and that shows a mobster who, while he gets involved with them, is not Italian. Film makers seem to take an easy way out these days depicting all Italians as mobsters. This film shows that they don't have a lock on the crime world, that there are others involved as well. The story is interesting, the character one that holds your attention and the technical aspects show a well put together film. All in all this is a movie that's worth renting if not owning.",1308960000,,4098,4.374507227332457
4463780,4,B004SKI7B2,"Small point of order. It is pronounced and spelled ""Collinwood"", not ""CollinGwood"" (Sorry Mr. Kilmer). I grew up there through the 80's and the way this movie was written falls within the the confines of the stories my friends and I were raised being told. I appreciate the theatrics though since this was based on a true story. Many ""Mafia"" or ""Gangster"" movies fail to show how hard working immigrants and their families fall into lives such as Danny Greene's and John Nardi. Well done. Depicted a sad but true portrayal of many lives in that neighborhood at that time and hit very close to home. As ironic as this may sound, it made me miss the ""Old Neighborhood"" even more after viewing this. I find movies based on true stories to be over embellished for the screen, but from what I know from living my childhood there shortly after Mr. Greene's death, it was very very close to the truth, theatrics aside. I tell people now where I am from and describe it as a ""Bronx Tale"" type neighborhood, partially due to it being the only reference that was most accurate. Now this movie gives yet another reference of where I am from. Thank you, from a proud Collinwood born and raised viewer.",1308614400,,1189,4.5607476635514015
4463781,2,B004SKI7B2,"This movie was lame. Nothing you haven't seen 100 times before in other gangster movies, only this movie just repeats those cliches. The violence is formulaic - yes, there are lots of explosions. Realistic, I suppose, but the beatings were not. Almost comic book-like. A waste of time.",1308614400,2,285,4.958333333333333
4463782,2,B004SKI7B2,"I don't know what all these four and five star reviews are about. They must be studio plants.  This movie is without a doubt the most schizophrenic movie, let alone most schizophrenic mob movie I have ever seen, while including every washed up actor who's ever played a gangster or corrupt official.  Warning: my snark may contain indirect SPOILERS.

The movie begins by stealing from On the Waterfront.  But that's a classic film and too old and subtle for a modern audience. The writers clearly got bored with that plot line five minutes into it, and felt they needed to steal from a more recent film. The director decided to start over, keep our previous scenes, and this time, film American Gangster, but instead of a black man, let's make him Irish.  And we must make sure the audience never forgets that our main character is Irish.  Insert Irish lame joke. Insert cliche mob scene. Inset lame Irish stereotype (he's Irish, therefore he must like the color green a lot).  Repeat! But the writers realized doing American Gangster was too much work.  Let's change the plot again.  Donnie Brasco meets Goodfellows! But the writer's focus wouldn't last.  Next we get a 5 minute interlude where Ray Stevenson becomes the gangster with the heart of gold.  I've seen that movie too. I liked My Blue Heaven more with Steve Martin, but they gave up on that plot line after five minutes and returned to making Goodfellows/Donnie Brasco.  They say this movie is based on a true story.  I believe it's made on many many true stories.  I just wish the writer's would have made up their mind on what true story they could rip off. Oh, but I'm ending my own review plotline too soon.  The movie is called Kill the Irishman.  It's time to take our journey on the Road to Perdition.

But despite the film makers having no clear idea what they were doing, I did enjoy this movie, but for none of the reasons highlighted by other reviewers.  We get to see the warden from Shawshank Redemption, Christopher Walken being stereotypical Walken, Bullet Tooth Tony, Laura Ramsey's breasts, a fat Val Kilmer doing his best Guy Pearce circa LA Confidential impression or maybe it's a Russel Crowe circa American Gangster, and much of the cast from Goodfellows.  Honestly, forget the plot altogether.  This movie is worth a Redbox for all the bad gangster stereotypes and outfits.  I still don't see the point of having Val Kilmer in this movie other than it's nice that he's still getting work.  But that reason is good enough for me.

This movie has everything you can expect from a mob movie: references to the Gambino family.  gratuitous yelling, gangsters being bad husbands, lots of talk about guys with foreign sounding last names, and the unions, unions, unions.  The director needs to open a friggin book. This is an awful movie. If I was Irish or Italian or a mobster, I'd be offended at my stick figure portrayals.  Since I'm not, this is the Evil Dead of crime films.  It gots cheesy death scenes, cheesy car bombings, and lots and lots of bad overacting. Oh, about that based on a true story gig.  It's never a mafia movie until you get an ending showing cut scenes from dated news coverage. This movie is a two star film, but with the right sense of humor, it might be three or four stars.

Definitely don't buy it until you rent it.",1308528000,2,3325,4.626279863481229
4463783,5,B004SKI7B2,"All the reviews say it, this is a great story, well acted, violent and a true story for however close the screenplay is to the actual story. Danny Greene makes you believe he is decended from Gaelic warriors. The guy takes no guff from anyone, especially enjoyed the biker scene where he punches a scumbag out with blood flying everywhere.

At the end you hate the inevitable happening which is Danny getting blown up but the narrator wastes no time in making you feel good by offering the fact that Danny's killer turned on his own group of italians which are supposed to have such an honor code.",1308441600,,597,4.527777777777778

4463785,4,B004SKI7B2,Kudos to the writer and director and actors for a well crafted story.

4463786,5,B004SKI7B2,I have been waiting to see this film for some time now ( after several released dates were pushed back and only selected cities and theatres played it). The movie didn't dissapoint at all. I thought it was very well done ( though i thought it could have been a 2-21/2 hour movie easily). I quite enjoyed the documentary as well..Again another film I had waited to see. I highly recommend this DVD!,1308182400,2,397,4.4520547945205475
4463787,5,B004SKI7B2,"Review by Ruby: If you are reading this, you have probably read the background info about The Irishman Danny Greene and his Italian buddy John Nardi who worked and broke the law many times over in the streets of Cleveland throughout the 1970s.  In addition to Greene and Nardi, many of the cast members were familiar ""mob types,"" and testosterone was practically flying off the screen in the midst of bravado, fistfights, gunfire, and countless explosions.  But there was an actual story to follow also, so it offered more substance than much of the drivel that manages to run in the theatres today.

 Even though they were gangsters, Greene and Nardi were surprisingly likeable characters (for killers, that is) mostly because of the charismatic acting of the two leads, Ray Stevenson and Vincent D'Onofrio.  The supporting characters were interesting also, including the talents of Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Steve Schirripa, Paul Sorvino, Tony Lo Bianco, and Mike Starr.

 Interspersed with the actors' scenes were actual clips of film footage from local newscasts of the day, which added authenticity and a touchstone to the amazing story that unfolded in Cleveland some 30-40 years ago.

 I highly recommend ""Kill the Irishman"" as an action-packed, escapist, period piece, featuring superior acting and excellent film editing.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable 100+ minutes!",1308182400,3,1381,5.264840182648402
4463788,4,B004SKI7B2,"This is an excellent organized crime film.  While it has less glamour and grandeur than Scarface or Goodfellas, it's perhaps more realistic and down-to-earth.  Ray Stevenson certainly looks a lot like the real Danny Greene did.  But he is not quite as charismatic as Pacino, Pesci or Robert Mitchum.  Ray does a solid job though, and he is quite believable as a book-reading, hard-punching and fearless Celtic Warrior.  The supporting cast is perfect.  Even Vincent D'Onofrio, who is usually too affected and quirky for my tastes, makes the wise choice of playing his character as a nebbishy accountant instead of a one-dimensional thug.  It was great to see aging actors Paul Sorvino and Tony Lobianco play authentic, old-school mafia bosses.  This film will take you right back to the seventies and you'll be grateful.  The only unrealistic thing in the whole film to me was all the bare-handed beatdowns that Danny Greene dishes out.  At least slip on some leather gloves, for chrissake.  Bare fists against skull bones lead quickly to broken knuckles and fractured metacarpals.  But this is Danny Greene, I guess, who was an implausibly tough Irishman.  Imagine taking on the Cleveland mafia and ultimately the entire Gambino crime family with just a handful of loyal friends.  Danny Greene was a rare fella.  We'll not see his like again.",1308182400,2,1343,5.013574660633484
8439871,5,B004SKI7B2,"I lived a few miles outside of Cleveland at the time of Danny Greene's death, but my dear old Irish Granny lived in Collinwood... and by the way Val Kilmer it's pronounced Coll-in-wood, not Coll-ing-wood. If he'd said that one more time I think I would have thrown something at the screen. Anyway, I knew the area pretty well, and this film does a great job of capturing the neighborhood and its denizens. I was shocked to see it wasn't filmed in Cleveland.

Yes, there were some missing pieces of the story and the inevitable liberties taken with characters and events, but overall Hensleigh's film does the tale justice. If you'd like details on the background and ALL the players in this tale, pick up Rick Porrello's book To Kill the Irishman, available here on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Kill-the-Irishman-The-War-that-Crippled-the-Mafia/dp/0966250893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Kill the Irishman: The War that Crippled the Mafia</a>

Porrello tells the whole thing from the perspective of a cop who knew Danny and most of the rest of them. It's a great companion to this great movie.",1528761600,,1150,5.491525423728813
