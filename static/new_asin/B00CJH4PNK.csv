5724416,5,B00CJH4PNK,I love it so far I lost 10 pounds in two weeks doing it once a day and some walking I love it !!!! Try it & be positive and you'll see the difference,1382054400,20,149,3.411764705882353
5724417,4,B00CJH4PNK,DVD in perfect condition. I didn't like all of the moves. I prefer taking an actual Zumba class. It will help you break a sweat though.,1377907200,,135,4.230769230769231
5724418,4,B00CJH4PNK,"Was shipped quickly and was what I was looking for, easy to follow, Good instructors. Only thing, I wish the music was a little more upbeat!",1374969600,3,140,4.423076923076923
5724419,1,B00CJH4PNK,"I bought this off Ebay. I have been taking a zumba class at the local club for about 6 weeks and wanted to do zumba at home too. I would call myself a beginner but this video is way to easy even with my little bit of experience. I broke a light sweat, that's it. There is way too much marching. The music isn't upbeat enough for me. Also, there are A LOT of unhealthy knee movements! Zumba is high impact that is a given, but there is a lot of knee twisting in this video! These instructors are going to screw up their knees if they are doing this 8+ times a week! I modified the knee twists, I will NOT do those. I would not recommend this video to anyone.",1373846400,6,657,3.984848484848485
5724420,1,B00CJH4PNK,"I ordered this item and it came with NO video in it as what i expected. So, i had to return the item and ask for refund. Beware of the open box policy.",1373155200,4,151,3.606060606060606
5724421,5,B00CJH4PNK,"I bought this DVD to sort of prepare myself for a real in-class Zumba session! Honestly it is so fun and with no other people around me, it felt a little better to dance it out and get familiar with Zumba moves. I think after a few sessions, I will definitely be feeling more comfortable and less 'embarrassed' to dance Zumba with other people in an actual studio. Definitely recommend!",1368662400,30,386,4.5285714285714285

5724432,4,B00CJH4PNK,"I just finished this workout. It was pretty awesome. I am rating it 4 stars because of some  weird camera action and I thought it could use some more time for cues. However, it may just be me. I also wish these dvds included a stretching section as well. The instruction book does include some stretches and there is also YouTube.",1405814400,,330,4.409836065573771
5724433,2,B00CJH4PNK,"For some reason I thought it was the exhilarate DVD set, so I was disappointed I paid thirty bucks for one DVD in a clear (burnable) disc (that was cracked). Very disappointing, so I sent it back.",1396915200,,196,4.324324324324325
5724434,3,B00CJH4PNK,I would recommend this for people just getting into fitness. It is low impact and fun. If you are really fit it doesn't get your heart rate up but it is good for an off day workout.,1396828800,,181,3.918918918918919
5724435,5,B00CJH4PNK,"Bought for the wife, she was getting tired of the other dance dvd's, and I want her to continue working out. Well, she is very happy with it. we got it three days after ordering, and immediately played it to check out the music and the moves, with plans of sending it back if she did not like it...Well, she likes it so much that she has been exercising to it everyday. We recomend this exercise dvd, it's worth every penny.",1395705600,2,424,4.246913580246914
5724436,4,B00CJH4PNK,This is a good workout.  Not too difficult.  There are 12 different dances.  Most of the moves are similar to other Zumba dances.,1395532800,,129,4.521739130434782
5724437,5,B00CJH4PNK,"Good bye Denise Austin! This DVD makes me look forward to a workout everyday! Now I must admit that at first it took some getting used to learning the dance moves and then once I did I was able to do it with more ""funk""  They're  fun gals to workout with everyday. I have always been more motivated when I go to a class but this video pumps me up! I also felt like they knew what they were doing. Opposite from what another review said.",1395014400,2,436,4.058139534883721

5724439,3,B00CJH4PNK,"This is just an ok on-line Zumba class. I had hoped for more upbeat music - this IS Zumba after all!  I bought this as a stand-alone DVD, so am in the catch-up mode to learn the steps. Would return it but it's not worth the hassle. I'll use it until I find a Zumba DVD with great Latin rhythms!",1394064000,,294,3.9
5724440,5,B00CJH4PNK,"Great little workout DVD. I joined a gym and want to participate in the free Zumba classes they offer, but I wanted to learn the steps a little before I joined in. It's a very fun workout. :)",1394064000,,191,4.052631578947368
5724441,3,B00CJH4PNK,The instructors need more training. They abruptly went from one move to another having ur knee to give out a little. The conversation between the two instructors were inrelevant.,1392595200,,178,5.172413793103448
5724442,1,B00CJH4PNK,"The music is terrible and it is not an enjoyable Zumba workout. It was listed as new, but came in a clear cd case like it was copied or used. I love Zumba, but this was not at all what I was looking for.",1392076800,,203,3.6363636363636362
5724443,5,B00CJH4PNK,"Love, love, love it!

5724446,4,B00CJH4PNK,"I really like this zumba workout dvd. I'm fairly new to zumba, and the leaders make it fairly easy to learn. there are 2 ways to learn: 'feel it' or 'listen' with instructions. Perfect length at 45 min. Love it!",1388707200,4,211,4.3

5724450,2,B00CJH4PNK,It looked like someone used the DVD and then stuck in it an old plastic DVD holder. Did not come in original package. Very disappointed.,1386720000,,136,4.48
5724451,5,B00CJH4PNK,I bought the complete set but wore out this particular CD within 2 years as I use it 5 days per week.  I was thrilled to be able to buy just this one CD and not the whole set.,1385251200,6,175,3.4871794871794872
