I was a successful professional horsewoman for many years, now retired( and at nearly seventy) and quite a few years out of the business, I am back now with renewed enthusiasm of learning this dance that is just for me and my wonderful gelding. Johns dvd is absolutely a wonderful start for me in this art.  He explains the art and equipment in such a wonderful, easy to understand way.  I look forward to watching this wonderful demonstration and step by step instruction video over and over. Thank you John.",1309219200,,588,4.689320388349515
8440962,5,B004TUA9C6,"This is a wonderful DVD.  If you and your horse have not worked with the Garrocha Pole, I would highly recommend it.  I had watched Garrocha performances at shows and always thought it was beyond what I could do with my horse.  But this DVD shows you how to get there from the beginning, starting with ground work to get your horse comfortable with the Garrocha Pole movements before you try it from the back.  The DVD also shows a horse that is not comfortable with the garrocha pole at first.  It gave me an idea of what to expect and how to help my horse through.  It has helped my horse's confidence and mine, my leg work has improved and my horse has become suppler from this art.  While my little Spotted Saddle Horse does not have the movement of an Andalusian, he can be just as graceful as one when he is working with the Garrocha.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone.",1307664000,,879,4.284848484848485
