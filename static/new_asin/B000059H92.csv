most of these old clips aren't 'bloopers' at all. there's a really bad music track, that's the only sound, besides occasional sound effects that must have come from a 99 cent cd rom.",1025049600,17,195,4.6
8468418,1,B000059H92,"Just received this tape today and feel duped. Even worse than this tape. The video quality was 4th generation-looking, the tracking was damaged over a considerable portion of the entire tape, and if that weren't enough -- it was compiled in Extended Play Mode!!!! There were probably a dozen very cool blooper scenes out of hundreds of mostly ho-hum, bordering on boring ones. The music bed underneath was extremely grating, especially since it did not develop for the 45 min. duration of the tape (the box says 50 min., but not true). I should return it, but it's just not worth the hassle. DO NOT, I REPEAT -- DO NOT -- BUY THIS TAPE. You will be sorry you did.",1014854400,,663,4.533333333333333
