This is one of my top 10 all-time workouts and I was pleased to be able to find it on amazon.com for a good price. Since it isn't available on DVD, I was skeptical that a VHS this old would be in good condition but it was in pristine brand new condition and I'm so happy I can do this work out again.",1495929600,,449,4.172413793103448
8196093,5,B000QFOCDA,"I had worn out my VHS copy of this great workout video and wondered what I'd do without it, because I knew that one day it just wouldn't work. I was thrilled to find this copy, and have enjoyed it nearly every day since it arrived. Fast delivery and great condition!",1338076800,,266,4.235294117647059
8196094,5,B000QFOCDA,"I recently purchased this after having given my original copy away several years ago. Boy do I regret giving it away! Little did I know I'd still want to do it years later even though I own a plethora of other Firm DVDs. In my opinion this is THE, best video THE Firm ever produced. I am definitely a Firm junkie and enjoy all their videos but after conquering the modern ones and feeling all strong and proud,this one has floored me, humbled me and brought me even  closer to my fitness goals. I am quite adept at the other videos but couldn't get through this one without stopping and/or skipping over some VERY HARD parts. I adore Susan Harris. She's an awesome motivator in so many ways. Some people feel the music or clothes are a bit corny and dated since the video was produced in the mid-80s but non of that dampened the fun and challenge I had doing the video. The music seems like regular workout music. And the clothes? Well, they're simply colorful, that's all. I feel blessed to have this challenging and very effective workout in my repertoire. Hope you enjoy it too!

Also, this video brings back such good memories since it was one my mother purchased when it originally came out and I had done it through my preteen and teen years. When something's good, it's good forever.",1279756800,4,1290,4.485106382978723
