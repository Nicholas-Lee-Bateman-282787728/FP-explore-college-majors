At first I thought it would not have happened since we have always heard how in love he was with his wife of many years. But then I thought to my self, ""how do we know what he might have done or not, including having cheated"" After all who knew what could have happened while he was away for his wife for long periods of time like this. But what ever, it was a very well acted and written story and held my attention thoough out. If one is looking for a story featuring his tricks and magic, you will be disapointed, as it is basicaly a love story and not a bio. If looking for facts and example of his trade, there are better examples out there. But as a love story about a famous figure, I found it workth viewing and it held my attention and interest to the very dramatic ending. bonus, disapointing",1295913600,,883,4.2
