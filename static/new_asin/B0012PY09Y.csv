8247172,3,B0012PY09Y,"Pretty good fantasy movie with an interesting, if not particularly original plot.  (This a pretty familiar storyline for readers of fantasy fiction.)  A lonely young man falls under the spell of a painting of a young woman.  The subject of the painting seems to come to life, steps out of the painting and kisses him passionately.  Thereafter he continues to see her alive in the painting and becomes obsessed with obtaining it at the cost of his savings, his job, the friendship of the waitress who falls in love him, and very nearly his sanity.

Victor Burke as the young man and Salli Saffioti as the waitress gives nice performances, as do a number of actors in supporting roles.  For an independent film the production values are good, although the cinematography is a bit jerky.

Not a particularly deep or moving film, it is obviously a labor of love on the part of director Phil Scarpaci and writer Colin Mitchell.

Not great, but certainly not bad.  Worth checking out.",1313712000,,978,4.739644970414201
