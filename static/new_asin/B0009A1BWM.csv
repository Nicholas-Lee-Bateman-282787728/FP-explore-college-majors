2274392,5,B0009A1BWM,"I love castles, and any old derelect buildings.  In fact, they hold more fascination for me than any complete pristine building.  These old castles are from a much earlier time and offers a glimpse into what the world was like for some.
Great way to spend time.",1367280000,3,261,4.531914893617022
2274393,3,B0009A1BWM,"I very much enjoyed seeing castles of Scotland as well as the coast of Scotland for the very first time! I particularly loved the second part of the dvd.

The orator on the other hand, was extremely boring!",1349913600,,206,4.421052631578948
2274394,4,B0009A1BWM,"DVD only shows current footage of the castles, no re-enactments, no historical pictures nor paintings. It lacks some narrative background and historical notes.
The kind of DVD sold as touristic memento at the castle gift-shop. Not of bad quality, though - the images are very clear and well shot.",1284940800,7,296,5.061224489795919
2274395,3,B0009A1BWM,"I would have liked a lot more historical detail and more castles covered.  If you've never been or seen, still not bad to look at before travel, but would not have been helpful for my travel companion.  I didn't send it back, but it just wasn't detailed enough for me.",1242345600,,268,4.34
2274396,3,B0009A1BWM,"In-depth visits to a couple of places. Quite acceptable but quicker visits to a lot of places might be preferred (at least, that is what I expected).",1217030400,,149,4.555555555555555
2274397,3,B0009A1BWM,"We were a little dissapointed as we saw a few things over nad over. Otherwise it is an enjoyable film.

I would not purchase it as a gift.",1173398400,8,138,3.9285714285714284
2274398,5,B0009A1BWM,"After returning from Scotland I had wished I had purchased some type of souvenir video over there.  However, after purchasing this one,  I was relieved to have a very nice souvenir of our vacation.  We had visited a number of the castles in the video and the Isle of Mull (which is also featured).

Highly recommended as an after visit purchase.  It would also be helpful in planning your visit, since it gives you an idea of what each castle is about.",1168905600,22,452,4.463414634146342
2274399,4,B0009A1BWM,"I found this collection to be thurough and informitive in its narration. The information was not only about the state of the castles currently, but also their history, who built them, why, the changes, battles, and multiple families that resided in them through time. The video footage was quite breath taking. I found myself in awe at the meticulous and exquisite craftsmanship of these castles, not to mention the sheer scale of them. In addition taking into consideration how these castles were built given the level of technology available at the time is a testiment to human ingenuity and determination. In conclusion I found this video excellent, it was money and time well spent. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys learning while being entertained.",1140739200,45,758,5.072
