Acting; I just love Antonio Banderas as the mysterious man. He made it fun.

Overall:  This film is just a flat out action, gun, and blood vengeance movie.  There are some funny moments that I chuckled at.  It's something I sat back and didn't expect much from beyond eating popcorn and being entertained for two hours.",1515974400,,500,4.488888888888889

725851,5,6303916228,"This corner of Amazon. com is probably stuffed with ""Desperado"" reviews from a dude's perspective, so I'm going to write this as a review by a female action-movie fan, to female action-movie fans.

Are you female? Do you like campy action movies? Do you like hot people? Then watch this movie. Watch it NOW.

THE PLOT:

There isn't one. Well, there kind of is, but it's flimsy. This movie isn't big on plot. You don't watch it for the plot. If you're looking for a movie that's ""deep"" and ""meaningful"" then go watch ""Casablanca"" (which is also an amazing movie).

THE ACTION:

This movie never pretends to be realistic or serious in it's action-scenes. Sure, there are a few emotional moments *between* the action scenes; but the fighting itself is never presented as ""gritty"" or ""realistic,"" like so many films nowadays attempt to do. In this movie, the action is fun and over-the-top, often to the point of being laugh-out-loud-funny. You'll see Antonio Banderas basically dancing around a counter, firing his guns in directions he shouldn't even be able to see from; you'll see a bad guy get shot and go flying into some decorative moose antlers on the wall, with hilariously bloody results; you'll see heroes whip guns out of their sleeves, and fire rocket misses from guitar cases. You'll see a villain flail his arms in hilarious over-the-top drama, just before the heroine plows him down with her truck. These fight scenes are fabulous in their camp.

THE HOT PEOPLE:

It's funny, but for a film that's supposedly a ""guy"" movie, there seems to be far more eye-candy coming from the *male* side of the cast, than female. Which is not to say that there's nothing in this movie for the lesbians in the audience; the villain's right-hand hench-woman is quite pretty, and Antonio's love interest Salma Hayek will make any straight girl question her sexuality. Jumping back to the men, Antonio Banderas--at the peak of his hotness, here in the '90s--is particularly delicious with long bad-boy hair and an absurdly smexy style of shooting. Tagging along (for the first half of the film anyway) is baby Steve Buscemi, who is so adorable in the opening scene it's *painful.* Add to that a buffet of hot Mexican gunners, and a great cameo by Quentin Tarantino (yes girls, all of us female action-movie fans would totally get with Tarantino; better you admit it to yourself sooner rather than later), and, well, it looks like someone's got some laundry to do tonight.

PACING:

The fad for movies nowadays is to be three-hours long, drawing out all the fight scenes until they become tedious, and stretching the film out more with back-story no one cares about. On the other hand, ""Desperado"" realizes that less is often more. You get the gist of the characters' motives and conflicts, without having to hear their life stories; the fight scenes are cleverly choreographed, but never seem to last more than five, maybe ten minutes. ""Desperado"" doesn't demand you sacrifice your entire evening to it; it just wants to offer you a fun, gun-blazing ride.

VERDICT:
If you are female and love campy action movies, then ""Desperado"" should be right up your alley.",1415059200,,3154,4.845724907063197

725972,3,6303916228,"The violence is so over the top. I don't get that w movies like this. One of the bar scenes: He kills roughly, say, three hundred people, half of those have semi-automatic weapons, they empty their clips -- yet he isn't shot. So what are we watching scenes like that for? Killing time til Hayak disrobes, and shows her gorgeous body? Seeing how real the fake blood looks? See how high in the sky the trampolines send them? What's the purpose? Is killing 20 people in a bar fight four times better than killing five? When he implausibility factor raises commensurately?",1405555200,,568,4.633663366336633
725973,4,6303916228,"Desperado was Robert Rodriguez's first movie playing with house money, the result proved that he was indeed a capable filmmaker. Since the $7,000 budget of El Mariachi was financed solely by Rodriguez himself, being able to see what he could do with an incrementally larger budget ($7 million) gave him a chance to show that he wasn't just a one hit wonder.

On the outside Desperado may just look like a generic 90's action movie with Mexican flair (it may on the inside a little too), but what it really showed was the potential of a talented filmmaker and ultimately the world that he would create with his Mexican Western trilogy. The nods to movies like Hard Boiled, Fistful of Dollars and various John Carpenter flicks aren't very hard to spot, luckily they became a bit more subtle in his films over time. One of the most notable things to come out of Desperado were the introductions of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek to the world, ultimately changing both of their careers forever.",1401235200,,992,4.734104046242774

726039,3,6303916228,"Its not that I expected a really smart film or anything, but I didn't expect this to feel so amateurish and soap operatic (but then again, maybe I should have).  The campy, theatrical tone really needs the right hand in order to make it all feel acceptable, and Robert Rodriguez just doesnt (or didnt) have that.  While the idea of a guitar playing vigilante exacting revenge on drug lords sounds like a lot of dusty fun, the execution here is so over the top and obvious that it falls apart at the seams.  The cast is fine, even if Hayek has never really been the best actress, and the ending twist is kind of great, but the buildup and the construction of these scenes is sostrange.  The over the top violence loses any excitement in the endless barrage of bullets that never seem to ever hit the good guy despite being showered with bullets, and the fact that Antonio Banderas is practically followed around with a wind machine from scene to scene is kind of ridiculous.  The plotting is also silly and the film winds up feeling like halfway thought out scenes filmed more for a look than anything else being strung along in an order that feels coherent but doesnt really make much of an impact.  But hey, that love scene is kind of hot and the music is amazing.",1391558400,,1265,4.454545454545454

I could only find one of the four (or five?) on VHS which I already have. As VHS degrades over time, I would like to have this whole series on DVD. From the first time I saw the first made-for-TV movie of Desperado, I anxiously awaited the next installment. The titles that I can remember are ""Avalanche at Devil's Ridge"", ""Badlands Justice"", and ""The Outlaw Wars"" in addition to the first ""Desperado."" I also saw a listing for ""The Return of Desperado"" but that one doesn't seem to have Alex McArthur in it.  Alex McArthur was wonderful in this series.

Antonio Banderas is the 'Biggest Mexican I ever saw,' whose face is always obscured by shadows.  Nobody's safe.

Robert Rodriguez took the profits from his first film, ""El Mariachi,"" and continued on with the story now with more funds, so he made it glossier, more explosive, added some name actors and, of course, way overdid it, making it almost a cartoon it is so outrageous. He continued this with the third film, ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" which is even more of the same.

Whether the movie is really dumb or its just tongue-in-cheek humor by Rodriguez, it has super-style and fun to watch. Talk about stylish! No wonder Quentin Tarantino and he are good friends and the latter has a guest appearance in the film. They both love having fun with the cameras.

The first eight minutes let you know what you are in for: outrageousness. It's an 8-minute scene at a bar involving a story told by Steve Buscemi. It's one of the highlights of the movie.

Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek are the ""good guys"" but they aren't exactly Billy Graham and Mother Teresa. If they are the good guys, you can imagine how evil the ""bad guys"" are? Speaking of them, two of the toughest- looking hombres in the business are chief among the villains: Joaquim de Almeida and Danny Trejo.

Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie.",1233878400,,1745,4.598070739549839

Open movie: a dusty saloon, down south of the border. The patrons heave and sweat and put down bitter foul smelling drinks. Then, everything gets much worse. Enter Antonio Banderas, and Robert Rodriguez's tribute to spaghetti westerns everywhere (close-ups on faces included) begins in a rain of blood and bullets.

Banderas, El Mariachi, is a man out for revenge in the classic style of everyone from Hamlet to Lee Van Cleef. He blasts his way through the film with a plethora of weapons from his handy guitar case. His mission is to take down the man who killed his beloved, a common thug at one point, the gangster kingpin Bucho now.

Rodriguez's direction is pretty darn good. The lighting and camera angles and such really instill a feeling, with the dust and filtered, orange sunlight, of the west as the the sixguns spout their lead.

Of course, there is a bit more than mindless action. Rodriguez infuses the story with brief flashes of humor; a prime example is the scene in which Cheech Marin's bar is totaled, which is perhaps my favorite moment in the film. Another is the discovery of Bucho's would be hired assassin.

However, the movie is mostly that mindless action. Don't go into this expecting much more; you will be disappointed. However, if you want a quick and satisfying updating of the spaghetti western genre, then this is the ultimate package for you.

726645,4,6303916228,"This film is supposedly a sequel to Rodriguez's earlier hit, ""The Mariachi"". As a sequel, it only partially succeeds. Partly this is because Antonio Banderas is just such a different person in terms of physique, drive and tone that the original mariachi. It was hard for me to make the jump that he was supposed to be playing the same person.

Another failure, from the sequel point of view, is that not enough is brought forward to the current film from the original. We know that Banderas is seeking vengeance for the murder of his girlfriend but not much else. The continuity between the two films is minimal.

That being said, this is still an effective shoot 'em up flick with lots of action and a few catchy lines. The conflicts are dramatic and you do find yourself wondering how in the world he is going to get out of the situations he finds himself in.

The plot is minimal and can be summarized succinctly: The bad guys have killed Banderas' girfriend and he is going to kill them all. That pretty much sums it up. Along the way, he faces doubts and searching questions from his friend and his new girlfriend. These do no keep him from blowing away the opposition but they do make him think about it for a little bit. ""What happens when you finally get them all?"" is a question asked more than one.

There is no doubt that this moive is violent and sexual in nature. If that does not scare you away and you like shoot 'em ups, then this can be an entertaining film. If you're looking for something more cerebral, look elsewhere.",1114905600,,1538,4.462633451957295
726646,5,6303916228,"When I was about 12 there was an Australian movie that ran in EXTREMELY limited release called ""Mad Max"" that I knew in an instant had to be one of the coolest movies ever made, but most people didn't get in on that fact until ""The Road Warrior"" came out a few years later.

As an adult, the best comparison I have to that scenario is ""Desperado"", a great movie seen by very few people (and a sequel to a movie called ""El Mariachi"" that still even fewer people saw), that now draws them in to due to the success of its own sequel ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"".

The story is simple enough and thanks to flashback sequences generously added by wunderkind director Robert Rodriguez, it is not necessary to have seen ""El Mariachi"" in order to enjoy it.  A guitarist (Antonio Banderas) whose lover was killed and whose own right hand was maimed (thus preventing him from ever playing guitar again) by a gangster searches for the big boss drug dealer behind the scene, killing pretty anyone who would obstruct his path of vengeance.  His calling card?  His old guitar case, now a portable weapons cache from which he plays a sonata of death.

Along the way he meets and falls in love with a woman (Selma Hayek, naturally) who would deliver him to the path of redemption...if only she were not also involved (romantically, possibly...financially, definitely) with the very man the guitarist has been hunting for years.

There are any number of subplots and supporting characters that make this movie memorable to me...Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino himself makes a memorable guest appearance, and the then-unknown Danny Trejo is terrific as one of my favorite cinema assassins EVER with a bitchin' tattoo beneath a leather vest loaded with throwing knives that have crucifix-shaped handles.

The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, every bit as memorable as that from ""Pulp Fiction"" (usually and correctly the most immediate contemporary film to which ""Desperado"" draws comparisons).  The opening dream/fantasy sequence features Banderas himself delivering a memorable vocal behind a blistering Los Lobos original song).  There is violence o'plenty, and it is overblown to such absurdist proportions that would shame most comic book editors; none of it is remotely believable, yet if you are a fan of Tarantino's movies (as well as those of Sergio Leone and John Woo), you will be suitably entertained and should be lining up to make ""Desperado"" a part of your permanent collection.",1105920000,,2480,4.939903846153846

726649,5,6303916228,"Sinking us back into the gritty life of a tormented guitar player, Rodriguez sets the stage for an amazing film.  This time, Antonio Banderas steps into the role of the troubled Mariachi as he continues his quest to rid Mexico of the corrupted drug lord that destroyed his life.  Using friends like Steve Buscemi, he finds the town that is harboring his villain named Bucho.  The Mariachi's form of questioning normally leads to several dead, a cinematic gun fight, and some classic Sergio Leone verbiage.  Unfortunately, our hero does not escape unscathed and finds himself being healed by the likes of Carolina, a bookstore beauty played by Selma Hayek.  Together they build a steamy relationship that will help our Mariachi reach his final destination.  As more gunfights, explosions, and blood rock this independent blockbuster, we soon discover a hidden secret about our hero, one that could change the course of his destination.

This was an impressive second outing by director Robert Rodriguez.  While I was worried that Hollywood would have drained too much of his imagination, it was instead the direct opposite.  Hollywood gave him the tools to build an amazing ""sequel"".  While different, yet the similar to his independent feature ""El Mariachi"", Rodriguez sets the stage for a roller coaster film that makes you hold your breath and pray for more.  He has taken elements from his first film and expanded them to new levels.  Banderas is perfect as our ""new"" Mariachi and the chemistry between him and Selma Hayek cannot be contested.  Banderas' ability to control this enraged man was spectacular.  They worked as our two main focuses of this film.  Coupled with some humorous moments with Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino, this film successfully stood on its own two feet thanks not just to the action, but the actors in their respective roles.

Finally, Rodriguez is a genius behind the camera.  He is able to give us exactly the right amount of action, drama, and comedy for our liking.  He is the proverbial salad bar of cinema.  While giving us this deeply rooted character hell-bent on destroying this drug lord, he also lets our imaginations wander with his comical and cartoonish action sequences.  The scenes of men flying through the air after being shot are somewhat comical, yet completely Rodriguez.  He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own.  Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.

Overall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection.

726650,3,6303916228,"Desperado was the necessary addition to Roberto Rodriguez's original film, The Mariachi.  Although the director is the same, there is definitely a revamp in the film.  For example, Antonio Banderas replaced the original actor of The Mariachi to play the character in Desperado.  This gives you a sense of what one can do with more money and a bit more time.

 However, I have not given you a sense of the story.  The story is set a few years after The Mariachi ended, with Steve Buscemi's character telling tales of this gun slinging Mariachi.  Apparently, Antonio Bandera's character, the Mariachi, has put up his guitar for his new lifestyle of revenge killings.  With his final revenge nearing, Banderas has many difficulties as his progress is halted many times.  Only when another lady comes into his life, played by Salma Hayek, does Bandera get back on his mission.

 This movie was good, and entertaining.  I do not feel that the acting was necessarily exemplary, although I did like Buscemi playing the role that he did, because it just seemed to fit him so well.  The gun battles were neat, and the cinematography over all was nice.  What really made this movie for me was the connection with The Mariachi, because it was not unlike, for good reason, Tarantino's style of tie-ins to previous movies.  This movie would get a 3.5 for its revitalization of the modern Western, with a distinctly Southwest/Mexican feel.

726713,4,6303916228,"After a couple of average DVD releases, ""Desperado"" finally gets the SPECIAL EDITION treatmant. The second and most popular in Robert Rodriguez's ""Maricahi"" trilogy takes a far different approach from its independent predacessor. As Robert explains on the audio commentary, his goal was always to make a low-budget movie that looked like a ""big summer blockbuster"" and few can deny that he acheived that goal.
""Desperado"" has Antonio Banderas taking over the Carlos Gallardo role as the mysterious loner with the guitar case full of guns. He is looking to avenge the death of the women he loves at the hands of a Mexican drug cartel. Along for the ride is an ensemble cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, and Danny Trejo. All of these actors pale in comparison to sexy young newcomer Salma Hayek who steals the movie in her major film debut as a librarian who eventually becomes Antonio's love interest.
""Desperado"" is one of the finest action films to be released in awhile. Only John Woo's ""Face/Off"" comes to mind when thinking of films released since that have been able to successfully mix stylish action sequences with great dramatic moments. The soundtrack, organized by Robert himself, and consisting a number of Tito & Tarantula tracks, really adds to the atmosphere of the film. Rodriguez has a lot of fun with a story that is esentially a Western genre film and pumps it full of amazing action scenes, hip dialouge, stunning actors, and a soundtrack that compliments it so well.
This is by far the best version to drop on DVD yet though it could have stood to include a little bit more behind-the-scenes footage. The director's commentary by Rodriguez is inciteful and the featurette chronicling the ""video storyboarding"" of the bar shoot-out is impressive but it would have been nice to hear some of the cast look back at the filming of this movie and perhaps, the inclusion of some deleted scenes would have put it over the top. All in all, you really can't complain. It is a quality DVD presentation of an excellent action film.",1078099200,,2073,4.875354107648725

There's good action, some funny moments (mostly courtesy of Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino), and the undeniable beauty of Salma Hayek.  The thing goes on a little too long, however, for a movie that basically just wants to entertain you with a succession of cleverly conceived and shot action sequences.  Kudos to the DVD image, though: it's blisteringly sharp and clear.  The extras are good, too.",1076457600,,630,5.3232323232323235
726715,4,6303916228,"Three  years after Robert Rodriguez came along and showed the world how a mere $7,000 and a lot of creativity could make a successful film called El Mariachi, he made Desperado.  This 1995 film has a bigger budget and more star quality, but the imprint of this director is certainly there.  There's lots of violence - with guns, knives and explosives.  And, like El Mariachi, the characterizations are secondary to the constant action.  It's all very silly, and a little too long at 106 minutes, but I frankly couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

The film stars Antonio Bandaras as the good guy and Salma Hayek as his romantic interest.  There's a cameo performance by Quentin Tarantino and Steve Buscemi has one of the best scenes in the film as he sets up the story at the beginning by his tall tale in a bar.

This is not a film to be taken seriously.  It's targeted to teenage boys and the video game crowd.

So why am I watching this flick and enjoying myself so much?  I guess it's cause I'm just a film buff and am fascinated by the techniques and constant action.  And best of all I loved the extra feature, which shows how one of the scenes was filmed.  It's not for everyone, of course.  But I liked it.",1075766400,,1215,4.390134529147982
726716,4,6303916228,"With a bigger film budget and a well-known cast, Robert Rodriguez's ""Desperado"" continues the tale of the Mariachi who was forced into a life of violence.  The film is action-packed, suspenseful and quite humorous.  Some of the action sequences are over-the-top, but then again that is most likely the point.  The end result is a very entertaining action flick that resembles a modern day Western.
The film is pretty much a sequel to ""El Mariachi,"" only this time with well-known stars.  The nameless Mariachi is still coping with the death of his girlfriend and is making due with his injured hand, but he has dedicated his life to wiping out big-time drug dealers.  His mission is against a certain known drug dealer that runs the town with an iron fist.  Knowing that his life is filled with hatred and vengeful wishes, the Mariachi totes a guitar case of ammo and fire power and won't think twice of using them when he's in a tight spot.  It's only a matter of time before he gets to show the drug dealer his ""bag of tricks"" personally.
This was a very highly entertaining movie to watch.  While it may not be a better film than ""El Mariachi,"" it proves to be a very stylized action trip with more tricks to it then ever before.  Rodriguez is able to use a higher budget and has a chance to do more with his film in a visual and action sense.  Even with the special effects and outstanding shootouts, Rodriguez is still able to tell a successful story.  Antonio Banderas is great as the ""Mariachi"" and gives his role a certain type of coldness to it--but is still able to add a lovable and sensitive quality to character.  It was great to see stars like Steve Buschemi, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, and Quentin Tarantino fill the screen with their unique talents.  In fact, it was during the shooting of this very film that Tarantino told Rodriguez that he had to make another movie since he considered it a Western Trilogy.  This would later on become ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico.""
The DVD has some cool extra features to offer.  First, the picture looks great and the sound quality is more than decent.  Extras included are an ""Anatomy of a Shootout"" featurette, a sneak peak at ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" trailers, commentary from the director and more.  The ""Anatomy of a Shootout"" featurette was extremely interesting to watch as Rodriguez lays down the thought process to most of the stunning action sequences in the film.  A pretty nice DVD package altogether, if you ask me.
""Desperado"" is a more-than-entertaining action movie with an interesting premise and some fantastic characters.  It's definitely a lot better than a good majority of the action flops that are out and about today.  If you're interested in seeing the continuation of the Mariachi's quest, then this is the pick for you.

The action sequences are marvelous and hold up well to the matrix style enhanced effects that came about later in the 90's.  Salma plays a strong willed and capable Latina book store owner, who crosses paths with the Mariachi, with a quiet fortitude.  She falls a bit too quickly for the hero as all hell breaks loose with the final showdown between Antonio, his two buddies [wielding guitar cases that launch rockets and double as machine guns], and the final drug lord.

His over-budgeted sequel, on the other hand, instead of delivering on the promise of a fresh indie sensibility gone big-time, simply sinks into a lazy assurance of its own B-flick boisterousness. It's odd to discover how little interest Rodriguez seems to have invested into making his clunky little revenge western even remotely engaging, almost leading the viewer to suspect the possibility of a very tragic film-industry clich: the money, the star power, and the stark abundance of resources have clouded Rodriguez's vision as a manufacturer of camp. Only a few of the screenplay's pointless contrivances (like a Quentin Tarantino cameo involving a very long and not particularly well told joke, or Steve Buscemi's introductory narration in a bar that cutely foreshadows the hero's first killing spree) summon up the idea that Rodriguez is just fooling around, which is exactly what he should be doing with a film that's already resigned itself to the lower notch of blockbuster entertainment. For the rest of ""Desperado""'s running time, however, the treatment of the material remains grim, studied, and joyless.

It doesn't get any better than this, especially since the tiny shrinking cinemaplex theaters have made my surround-sound and 32"" TV the theater of choice.

One minute he's pulling fiery Spanish licks from a battered acoustic guitar, the next he's marching determinedly through a firestorm of bullets.  With a pump-action shotgun in one hand and serious haircare products in the other, he's a man possessed, a latino Clint Eastwood rolling into town to blast the scum off the streets.
Steve Buscemi is the mariachi's edgy sidekick, brilliantly setting the film's semi-mythic tone with a hilarious pre-credits monologue.  Quentin Tarantino plays a sleazy drug dealer, delivering terrifically vulgar quips to camera while bodies pile up around him.
Desperado is so much more than an action film.  It's a modern Western; a black comedy romance; an explosive cocktail of pastiches and homages to everyone from Peckinpah to Leone, Almodovar, John Woo and--of course--Tarantino.  But the action is nevertheless ample and noteworthy, handled with a balletic subtlety and eye-boggling invention which acknowledges Tarantino and his Hong Kong mentors without succumbing to imitation.  Superheated bouts of mass gunplay are orchestrated almost musically, with style, rhythm and immense attention to detail.
With Los Lobos cranking out turbo-charged latin-surf riffs throughout its pounding soundtrack, Desperado is a dazzling operatic riot of sound and fury and sweat and mud and guts.  This dynamite rockn'n'rollercoaster of a film will leave your brain dancing a blood-splattered lambada for weeks afterwards.",1022457600,,1655,5.758196721311475

This DVD edition is superlative. I've never seen - and never heard - anything better. This DVD proves Superbit is a real improvement because the original DVD edition of Desperado was really a good one: the betterment both in audio and video is substantial.

726872,4,6303916228,"This week I had an opportunity to take a look at the new Superbit DVDs from Columbia Tristar. Of all the Superbit DVDs we looked at the one which clearly delivered on the Superbit promise is Desperado Superbit with a version clearly superior to the initial release. From the first scene in the movie on, the picture is remarkably improved over the original version. To give you an example of how big the difference is, when Steve Buscemi's character walks into the bar, it looks like it is lit in a murky brown light, whereas in the Superbit version the bar is clearly and evenly lit by a dark red light. I was like, ""Oh, so that's what it's supposed to look like!"" I found myself comparing a good number of scenes in Desperado, and clearly across the board the Desperado Superbit looked better. The key scene I selected compare between the two versions in Desperado was the one where Carolina (played by Selma Hayek) sings a song on the bed of El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas). Some of the notable differences I could see:
* Skin tone! Wow! In the Superbit version there's a dramatic difference in skin tone, it looks a lot richer and is a much truer color.
* As the camera pans over to Selma's face you can see much more detail in her face and on her skin.
* The colors of El Mariachi's guns are much different and they glimmer in the Superbit version. In the original version they are a dull metallic color.
The DTS audio track is as dramatic a difference as the picture. Most noticeably is when El Mariachi jumps backward from the top of the building firing his pistols. In the DTS audio track you hear a thud as he lands, something I didn't hear in either the old or new Dolby Digital tracks. Of all the Superbit Titles, Desperado is the easiest to recommend as a 'replacement' DVD for someone who already owns the original version. The improvements in the Superbit version are significant enough to warrant a purchase and you don't give up anything going to Superbit, as the original release didn't have any special features. However, there was also a double feature release (yep, Superbit makes release #3), which had Desperado on one side and El Mariachi on the other, so that's a pretty huge special feature to give up (and the only way to own El Mariachi on DVD).

The choreographed action is both gripping and amusing at the same time - sure it is violent, but it is not ""real"" violence - this is meant to entertain. Salma Hayek is just luscious too. My only quibble with the film is its ending which is very much an anticlimax. The plot IS cartoon like - but that is the point - this film is played for laughs. I liked the American tourists in the heavy Mexican bar not leaving a tip due to bad service - priceless. This film made me chuckle all the way through.

This movie is great, I like the beginning where Buscemi is exaggerating about El Mariachi about the shootout he witnessed in Zaragosa.  I also like when Tarantino tells his joke to the bartender.

726958,5,6303916228,"I am the type of guy who likes original stuff, if you've read any of my other reviews, you know.  So when it comes to action flicks, I am hard on'em, if they don't have one-man-kills-twenty action, I won't like it.  If they don't have gun battles, I won't like it.  If there isn't a good plot, I won't like it. If it doesn't have humor on the side, I won't like it.  And it has to be non-predictible and action that makes you laugh it is so cool, without that, I won't like it.  I had a tough time finding a movie that fits this catagory until I saw a preview for 'Desporado' on another movie.  When the preview was over I said ""That is the one.""  I sure was right.
This movie has got it all, the most original plot (revenge), some awesome one-man-kills-twenty action, action that makes you laugh, more than enough humor(If it has Steve Buscemi in it, it has to be funny), a girl, and the big non-predictible action(tell me that a guitar case that is a rocket launcher is predictible)!  Plus is has got a great cast with Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Steve Buscemi.
So, if you like original action movies, see this movie, if you like other stuff see this movie, everbody, see this movie, this is the best movie there is and I am ashamed of myself for not knowing about it until one month ago.  This movie should go down in history!",979776000,,1336,4.26984126984127
726959,4,6303916228,"This psuedo-sequel to Rodriguez's exremely low-budget ""El Mariachi"" is all about action.  If you're not an action fan, this movie is, plain and simple, not for you... but if you *DO* like action, this one has it in spades.
What gives this movie an edge over other action flicks, in my opinion, is that it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Sure, there is a little romance, but the girl (Salma Hayek) never distracts from the action scenes... in fact, she participates to a limited degree in some of them.  Sure, there's humor, but it's not Schwarzenegger-style cheesy one-liners, it's actually funny, and again, it doesn't distract from the action.
Now, the action.  Pure, unadulturated, edge-of-your-seat action.  Top notch.  Eye-candy galore.
This movie gets 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: #1, it's entirely one-dimentional, and #2, the gun-battles, as is typical in most action movies, stretch the bounds of reality to the breaking point.  Yes, Antonio Banderas *does* reload, but still, I think 5 guys with machine guns can take one guy with 2 hand guns.

Apart from the fact that it's a  refreshingly well made Mexican revenge story, well shot and craftily edited  by Robert Rodriguez. It's also extremely funny in places. Some bits are  stupendously over choreographed and others are as naturally clumsy as you'd  expect in bar fights! The good guy doesn't have infinite ammunition  either!

726963,4,6303916228,"As far as revenge flicks go, this one plays by all the rules....and still delivers the goods.  The main draw of this film is (and ought to be) the promise of some amazing action scenes.  With Robert Rodriguez directing,  you know you'll get what you paid for.  Revenge flicks also need an angry  lone hero out to get anybody for a past wrong. And here we have Antonio  Banderas in (what I consider to be) his breakout role.  His is really the  only character that has the amount of depth usually reserved for more  weighty films. But then again, we're talking about a Robert Rodriguez  movie. And Banderas is a damn fine actor. He is perfectly cast as the  nameless ""Mariachi."" Salma Hayek is lookin' good as the love  interest, but aside from being Salma Hayek (something no man can quibble  over), she isn't given much to work with.  Still, there is a hilarious  throwaway role filled past the brim by the inestimable Steve Buscemi;  Cheech Marin appears as ""the Bartender.""  Quentin Tarantino even  pops up to tell an obscene joke (can you imagine?).  The one debit this  film has going against it, besides the one-dimensional -- though highly  entertaining -- characters, is the fact that the huge climactic gunfight at  the ranch never is shown! (If you've seen the film, you know what I'm  talking about.)
I suppose I should summarize.... ""Desperado""  rocks.  Plain and simple, if you're looking for an above-average action  thriller with lots of goofy humor, this is the way to do it.  And if you're  really ambitious, I highly recommend seeing ""Desperado"" and  ""El Mariachi,"" Rodriguez's original feature debut, in one sitting  and comparing the two films.  ""El Mariachi"" is much better, but  since it was filmed on a shoestring budget, it doesn't feature some of the  more mind-blowing fight sequences you can find in ""Desperado.""  It's up to you to decide which is better, but for sure,  ""Desperado"" is one of my top picks for a guilty pleasure.  4 of 5  stars.",960163200,,1971,4.724852071005917

The Tarantino factor seems a  little misplaced, substituting gore for the normally balletic qualities of  the showdowns, but the presence of the actors pulls it off with style.
Simply put, this movie is what it is - fantastical action/shoot-out  stuff, with hardly a thought spared for realism. And that, in the end, will  determine your reaction. But let's face it - it's a great ride.

727051,4,6303916228,"Rodriguez made a small film called ""El Mariachi"" that was beautifully realized and made for under $7,000 dollars and now he gives us the ""now-that-I-have-enough-money"" version.
And it's  beautifully realized. Somewhere between John Woo and Sergio Leone with a  little Coppola and Tarantion thrown in for luck, this movie is a miracle of  story-telling and style.
This time, the Mariachi-Man(with a small arsenal  in his suitcase) is played by Antonio Banderas(THE MASK OF ZORRO). Every  scene that he's in is filled with violence and dangerous sexuality that  makes him one of the most sought-after male leads in Hollywood. In the  opening, Steve Buscemi(CON-AIR, FARGO, THE BIG LEBOWSKI) tells the story of  a mysterious shadowy stranger who goes from bar to bar, looking for the man  who destroyed his life. In the process, he shoots up everybody, including  the bartender, much to the unease of 'tender, Cheech Marin(T.V.'s NASH  BRIDGES, TIN CUP).
You see he's part of the front for Bucho, played by  Joaquin Del Alameida (ONLY YOU, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER), the man who  killed Mariachi's woman. And Alameida is wonderfully cast as the baddie,  being shadowy and sexy at the same time with a gruff voice and commanding  eyes that you can read like a book.
And so, the story rages on, and so  does the mythology. Mariachi goes from place to place, trying to avoid  being shot at in action scenes that look borrowed from the Universal  Studios Western Stunt Show. In the process, Banderas meets Carolina, played  by the beautiful Salma Hayek(54, THE FACULTY, FOOLS RUSH IN). She's eye  candy, but instead of just looking pretty like most models in film(see  CINDY CRAWFORD in FAIR GAME), she actually ACTS. Her character is complex,  in that she is part of the Bucho's Front, so she understands the violence  and the drugs. That's how she is able to fall in love with Banderas in the  first place.
And there's many contradictions that hide in this film(the  Mariachi has one spur, not two; the movie is in the present, but there's a  lack of any technology; the love scene with Banderas and Hayek is  beautiful, whereas the cut to his enemy having sex is slutty and whore-ish,  you are able to make out the contrast between good and evil) and in these  scenes, Rodriguez handles things beautifully.
Again, the love scene with  Banderas and Hayek is a gorgeous standout. There are, what seems like a  hundred lit candles in the room and the beautiful ""Bella"" by  Santana is played in the background. It's filmed slowly, passionately, and  so romantically that you're almost hypnotized by it. It's the best love  scene since the Snipe' neck-bite in BLADE.
There are many surprises in  this film that are worth mentioning, but I won't go into them. See this  film for yourself, then rent ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and you'll  have yourself a great American-Mexican Western-Fest in your own living  room.
