3557331,1,B001ET62PS,"I bought this sight unseen to show my 9th graders when we read the story in class.  It is so bad, acting, dialogue, camera work, etc. that they can hardly stand to see it.  I use it as an example of how a great story idea can be ruined.  I stress how artists make choices and how this is full of bad ones.  I tell them that the stories we read may not be their favorites, but that they are at least well crafted works of art.  This is not.  Really, my favorite scene is where they replace the fabulously costly lost necklace with one they buy in a Hallmark Gift Shop.",1256083200,11,567,4.017857142857143

8299485,1,B001ET62PS,This was a terrible example of a famous piece of literature.,1462147200,,60,4.545454545454546
8299486,1,B001ET62PS,"I read all the bad reviews and thought the film couldn't really be that bad. I rented it to see for myself, and to see if I might somehow be able to use it for class, but....no way. I'm wondering how this is even available on Amazon? Don't waste your $2 to rent...not worth it. There are comparable student-made versions on youtube that aren't as cheesy.",1446768000,3,354,4.378787878787879
8299487,1,B001ET62PS,"This is THE worst movie (acting, directing, sound, lighting....) I have EVER watched. On a positive note, I only wasted $2.00, and my theatre students were able to see how NEVER to direct, produce, or act!!",1422489600,2,206,4.75
8299488,5,B001ET62PS,Our students enjoyed the story.  They later saw the story on live stage at a nearby university.,1420761600,,95,4.588235294117647
8299489,1,B001ET62PS,"It seems like teachers are the ones who got this video as a supplement to the classic short story, and were ALL dissatisfied. Sadly, I didn't read the reviews and made the same mistake. However, because I just finished watching it to prepare the lesson ahead of time, my students will not have to suffer through it as I did. I am doing a last-minute change of plans. This remake of a classic story is a catastrophe start to finish. Guy De Maupassant would die all over again if he caught a glimpse of this horrible mutation of his brilliant story. Too bad we can't give it a rating of negative stars!",1379721600,6,600,4.366071428571429
8299490,1,B001ET62PS,Usually students are happy to watch a video - any video. But my students hated this so much that they asked to do classwork instead.,1357084800,2,132,4.32
8299491,1,B001ET62PS,"The music was overwhelming, the voices of the actors could not be heard.  The acting as atrocious, the setting, lighting, props,etc. were awful.  I was extremely disappointed with this film.  I stopped it about 15 minutes in and did not continue to watch it.",1352246400,2,258,4.818181818181818
8299492,1,B001ET62PS,"Do NOT buy this non-professional, filmed-in-my-garage video.  We thought we'd get a version of The Necklace to show to students who had read the short story but it was a joke.  What should have been a 20 minute video was over an hour long with bad acting, bad videography, and bad music.  Don't waste your money.",1256688000,15,312,4.535714285714286
