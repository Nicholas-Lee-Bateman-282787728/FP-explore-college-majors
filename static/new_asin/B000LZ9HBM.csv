One CAVEAT:  It's easy to see that the DVDs were copied from video tapes.  However, I rate the video quality an 8 out of 10.  The instruction is clear and concise with plenty of examples.  I'm very happy with the quantity of moves.  The main menu and the sub-menus are a breeze to use and quickly find a specific location on the DVD.  I've gone onto purchasing Bolero, Rumba, Mambo, Waltz, Foxtrot, Polka, Viennese Waltz, etc. at discounted prices through Amazon.  Although, the DVDs come from ""Dance Lovers"" (the creators of the DVDs), the DVD containers do not come manufactured- wrapped.  No problems so far.",1237161600,,738,4.785714285714286
