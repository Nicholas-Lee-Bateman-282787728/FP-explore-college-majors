8504011,5,B001DAVT6U,Just to clear a few things up. First is the description states this comes as 1 DVD. This is a two DVD set. Second disc is live performance footage of most of the bands in the movie. I know this as i produced it. Second is from time to time i see this going for well more than its worth from time to time. As i write this someone is asking 112 dollars. Seriously do not pay that much.  Do not OVERPAY!!!!!!,1338249600,,405,3.9390243902439024
