8646343,2,B0038QPLVQ,"Very deceptive!  Amazon needs to put the statement, ""This is not a movie!..."" at the top of the description of this dvd, and not bury it in the editorial comments section.  Especially if I know what a movie is like when I'm considering purchasing it, I don't bother with the ""editorial comments"".  In addition, the reviews on the first page, which we do usually read before purchasing an item, were all attributed to the ""movie"", not just the ""book on dvd"".  My teen daughter was intensely disappointed to find that her purchase was simply a book on dvd, that had to be read on a t.v. or computer screen.",1526601600,,604,4.513761467889908
