3748305,3,B001PKX5T2,"This film has great stars which was typical of MGM films of the 1950's. Robert Taylor is one of my favorite actors, Ava Garder is very beautiful, and Howard Keel is O.K. But Anthony Quinn was acting over the top. Was a Mexican supposed to be like this? Shouting, gesticulating, emoting like a wild animal? You have to notice him when he is on the screen. Contrast him with Taylor. I prefer the minimal acting type of Taylor. There are many kind of love stories. The greatest one is between Quinn and Taylor, though mainly Quinn shows it. It is sometimes hard to understand the motivations of these people. There is a priest who talks about peace (do not kill!), but he is using guns like everybody else. Maybe motivation is not important in this kind of classy western. It is a watchable film, but not a great one (I give five stars only to Rio Bravo, Warlock and Magnificent Seven).",1293926400,11,883,4.490683229813665

8333666,3,B001PKX5T2,"I love westerns, and I've always thought Robert Taylor made a good cowboy, and a lady friend of mine loves Ava Gardner, so I bought this one for us to watch.  Anthony Quinn stands out as a psychotic Mexican bandit, and Robert Taylor does a good job as a tight-lipped philosophical cowboy, but poor Ava Gardner spends most of her time leaning her head back to stare up at Howard Keel.  This is the least of the Robert Taylor westerns I've seen.  I really like Westward the Women, The Law and Jake Wade and Many Rivers to Cross.

Ride Vaquero! is good enough if you're in the mood for a western and don't have any better choices.

And it's worth watching to think about the nature of westerns.  The best westerns are about overcoming adversity.  Howard Keel won't back down, but he's never heroic. Robert Taylor plays a reluctant bandit who refuses to commit to anything.  Ava Gardner gets to be little more than arm candy.  It's only Anthony Quinn who plays a crazy killer that has any passion and love for life, but he only tears things down.  Westerns are about men and women building something in the wilderness, and Howard Keel fits the western hero role, but the movie doesn't focus on him.  The bigger movies stars steal the story.",1375833600,2,1236,4.5225225225225225
8333667,4,B001PKX5T2,Who could ask for anything more...a classic western that also included Ava Gardner.  Although Robert Taylor and Howard Keel gave good performances it is Ava who dominates the picture...even though Anthony Quinn tries to dominate by his tendency to overact.,1375660800,3,256,5.4
8333668,5,B001PKX5T2,"This an excellent movie Robert Taylor plays a great part along with Ava Gardner
and Anthony Quinn again plenty of action well written story if you enjoy westerns
this one i would recommend well worth purchasing sit down and enjoy.",1333065600,5,230,4.775
