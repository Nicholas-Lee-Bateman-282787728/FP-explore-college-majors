8178744,5,B000NJWIG2,"Miguel (who is about 15) and his twin or slightly older teenage sister live alone on an isolated farm in Mexico. They are extremely poor and have little contact with the outside world. After an outlaw kills Miguel's sister he is left with nothing except a strong desire for revenge, a rife and a mule. (Well technically he also has a ragged pair of pants, a vest and a blanket but does not even have shoes nor a shirt, they were very poor.)
Another outlaw is also after the outlaw who killed Meguel's sister because the first outlaw stole the second outlaw's horse and his half of a large heist. However the second outlaw also has a couple of problems, he is a gringo in Mexico who does not speak Spanish and he does not have a horse since the first outlaw stole his. Meguel is fluent in both English and Spanish and has a mule. The second outlaw reluctantly agrees to take Miguel with him in his search for the first outlaw. The result is a slow male bonding experience between the second outlaw and Miguel.
Despite a bank robbery and two major gun fights the movie overall is light and easy going, but never dull. The main theme is the bonding between Miguel and the outlaw he is traveling with, but the movie also follows the outlaw they are trailing. For those who care (either being for or against it) there is one brief skinny dipping scene in the movie. Miguel is clearly seen totally nude from the rear at a distance, and up close sitting nude on a rock. The sitting shot is from the side so even though he is clearly nude only his side is showing. In the rest of the skinny dipping sequence he is either underwater or behind rocks from the waist down. He is the only one skinning dipping. The outlaw swims in his long johns here and in an earlier scene where both outlaws swim in their long johns.
 I don't want to spoil anything by giving up too many details here so I will be a bit vague. Toward the end of the movie Miguel and his outlaw companion, and the other outlaw find allies. The perused outlaw and his ally have major plains beyond Miguel and his companion. (In fact his ally probably knows nothing of Miguel and the other outlaw.) While the end of the movie was not a total surprise, it might not be exactly the way you would guess.",1394668800,,2253,4.326241134751773
8178745,4,B000NJWIG2,"i have read on line that this was a bad movie. well, let me tell you i really enjoyed it. true it not in the class of the good the bad and the ugly but it is a very nice movie to watch. i would highly recommend it to any one. i very much liked gerry ross in this movie. he looks and his voice sounds much younger than his 16 yrs that he was when this movie was made",1374019200,3,365,3.575
8178746,4,B000NJWIG2,"I'm going to give this little film a better review.  You can see the potential of this revenge western and Jon Cypher / John Garces do a great job.  This is a film lost to time if someone didn't rescue it. I enjoyed it very much.

Since no one has given a synopsis, here it is: A young boy's sister is killed by bank robbers on the run. The killer, John Garces, grabs the money and takes off. The other bank robber however has some sympathy for the kid's situation and reluctantly the two join together to chase the killer.  Jon Cypher wants the stolen money back and the kid, played by Gerry Ross, wants revenge for his sister's death.",1297728000,4,636,4.275
8178747,1,B000NJWIG2,"I knew the movie was odd, which is okay. I like odd movies.
But it's intolerable to put a copy of an old wrinkly VHS tape on DVD and sell it for 20 bucks!
If you are looking for this movie in a decent picture quality this edition is NOT the one you should buy!",1293580800,4,260,3.7454545454545456
8178748,2,B000NJWIG2,Twenty minutes were indifferently lopped out of this movie by three subsequent editors after the director left the project.  That probably accounts for the muddled mess that remains of what might have been a pretty good western.,1200528000,4,228,5.162162162162162
