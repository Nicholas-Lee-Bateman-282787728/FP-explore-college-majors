8662797,5,B00KZ1D7FE,"This Interview DVD of Jessicka Havok was awesome, wish it could've lasted a bit longer but it was great. Miss Havok is truly a great person and she talks about her career from the beginning of it up until right now and there are two bonus matches on the DVD as well. Any fan of Jessicka Havok should get this DVD, it's worth the $19.00. Sojo Bolt also does a solid job as the interviewer. Highspots did an amazing job and I have ordered  two more of the Diary DVDs.",1415923200,,465,4.166666666666667
8662798,5,B00KZ1D7FE,"Where do I begin? 'Highspots' always presents the most intriguing, most intimate, and most interesting conversation anyone could have in a ""Shoot Interview"". This edition is no exception! Young Ms. Havok sits down with Dame Josie to engage in an explorative & revealing dialect. Exciting stories. In depth theoretical expressions (you'll see what I mean;-) and a great sit-down with a great lady. 5 Stars is not enough.",1406246400,,419,5.176470588235294
