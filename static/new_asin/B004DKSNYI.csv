8425521,2,B004DKSNYI,"The DVDs are not rated as you can see. We bought two for our kids only to find out there is profanity throughout.  I was quite disappointed because the footage is good.  When I wrote Robb personally with my review. He wrote back and I quote: ""You're welcome to your own opinion, but obviously it's not that big of a deal for most people. I look forward to never doing business with you again"".  So if you're looking for kid-friendly videos, I would look somewhere else.",1389139200,2,469,4.430232558139535
8425522,5,B004DKSNYI,"Any coaster fan has to own these DVD's! The quality, presentation (front and back POV's), and variety of rides are simply not found anywhere else!  These videos are the real deal...not shaky handheld POV's like you see on youtube.  Awesome!!!",1346198400,,242,5.025

Okay, this would be fun to experience while sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn, but it's even more fun while running on the treadmill! That's what I do--but watch your step! You could get a wee bit disoriented.

Best roller coaster footage ever, as far as I've seen. Multiple roller coasters from around the world, and you can adjust what you hear. But my favorite part? For EVERY roller coaster, the camera FIRST rides in the very front seat, facing forward, then repeats the ride in the very back seat, facing backwards!!! Now THAT's FUN!

I highly recommend this ride!",1344988800,,769,5.787610619469026
8425524,5,B004DKSNYI,This is an AWESOME DVD with amazing roller coaster footage that is PERFECTLY and professionally filmed.  You won't find anything like this online and this has some awesome coasters in this edition like Intimidator 305!  It also has a bunch of coasters from parks all over the world that most of us can only dream of riding.  Don't miss out on this or any other of the Theme Park Review DVDs!,1341878400,,391,4.47887323943662
8425525,3,B004DKSNYI,"I love great theme park footage and this DVD is packed with
it.  If only the people in the video were a little less
annoying, it would be the perfect video.  Still, it's
got great visuals and a good collection of footage.

If you like roller coasters, you can't really go
wrong with this one.",1337990400,,292,4.2727272727272725
