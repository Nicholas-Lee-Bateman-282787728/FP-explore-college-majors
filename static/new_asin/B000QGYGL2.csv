8196388,1,B000QGYGL2,The vulture is a very good movie and truly wish it were all DVD as well but for the price they're asking for this VHS is truly not worth it.. and that's the only reason for the one-star for the movie itself I give it 5 stars,1459728000,,224,3.7872340425531914
8196389,5,B000QGYGL2,My sister and I use to go to the movie every Saturday in the summer.  we saw 2 movies for .25 CENTS.  That was many many many years ago and this is the only movie I remember.  Way awesome!!!!,1433548800,,191,3.8461538461538463
8196390,5,B000QGYGL2,"We lost our copy ""The Vulture"" to a house fire and it is greatly missed.  It was such a fun scary movie:  it is well acted, location is great, and the fun comes in when one tries to envision a mutant bird large enough to air lift Broderick Crawford.  It also has all the expected 50s horror movie dialog: the hero makes pronouncements that he is ""an atomic scientist"" so therefore he knows everything!",1288137600,3,401,4.391891891891892
8196391,4,B000QGYGL2,"I saw this movie on TV several times when I was a kid and loved the atmosphere of the classic. The product review pretty much sums up this movie but does not illustrate what a fantastic old horror movie this really was. If any movie companies have this in their vault, I wish they would release it on DVD.",1252281600,10,305,4.186440677966102
