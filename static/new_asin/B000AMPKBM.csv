8447939,3,B000AMPKBM,"This review is for the Miracle Pictures/Ventures DVD release version of this double feature Barbara Stanwyk presentation of Lady of Burlesque and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.
The Side with The Lady of Burlesque plays very nicely indeed but the opposite side with the Strange Love of Martha Ivers has 4 ""flubs"" while playing. That's the only word I could come up with to describe the sudden/quick, stop/start blurriness that occurred while the movie was playing. It is nonetheless watchable and enjoyable....I just thought you should be aware of it.
In any case watching Ms Stanwyk strutting her stuff singing ""take it off the e string, put it on the g string"" is reason enough to buy this double feature set especially at this low, low price.  Her performance in that scene alone is itself priceless.",1279584000,,805,4.875912408759124

MIRACLE's Barbara Stanwyck double feature offers two of the finest public domain classics currently available. Miss Stanwyck was discovered by and married to vaudeville pratfall comic Frank Fay until his drinking and her success destroyed their marriage. It's said that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-STAR-IS-BORN/dp/B00023BLQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A STAR IS BORN</a>&nbsp;(1937) was based on their lives.

THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS (1946)
Classic film noir. Cast includes Van Heflin, Lisabeth Scott, Judith Anderson and Kirk Douglas in his first movie. Douglas, who plays Stanwyck's weak-willed alcoholic D.A. husband, is almost unrecognzable behind that pointy pre-rhinoplasty nose. In this Lewis Milestone flick, teenaged Barbara murders a hated aunt by shoving her down a flight of stairs. As an adult, she's even more ruthless. Martha Ivers is easily one of the Top Ten villainesses of all time. Highest recommendation!

LADY OF BURLESQUE (1943)
Bill Wellman film based on Gypsy Rose Lee's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-G-String-Murders/dp/1558615032/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The G-String Murders</a>."" Stanwyck's co-star, Michael O'Shea had his screen debut here. O'Shea was brother to 5 police officers, but defied his cop dad and went into Show Biz. In 1943 he married Virginia Mayo. Here, O'Shea is a baggy-pants clown opposite Barbara's stripper. In this story of jealousy among burlesque girlies, some of them are murdered and Babs is prime suspect. Because of a strict production code you won't see any skin here, but there's plenty of razor-sharp dialogue in a finely-crafted murder mystery.",1268870400,3,1897,6.178030303030303
