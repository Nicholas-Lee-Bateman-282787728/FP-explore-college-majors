8082859,5,B000B7MXC0,Nothing like the sound of a crackling fire to relax by. Now I can take it with me. Love it.,1323216000,,91,3.6
8082860,3,B000B7MXC0,"This DVD is exactly what one would expect to get from a Fireplace DVD: Crackling fire, cheesy music, flickering flames.

If you're looking to just have a funny fire on your TV for the holidays or a party, this one is perfect. It loops pretty seamlessly and you are able to turn the music off and just have the crackling fire.

Fire It Up baby!",1242000000,,343,4.2615384615384615
8082861,1,B000B7MXC0,"We were very disappointed.
It looks to be a repeating image of a gas fireplace although they did add crackle sounds for affect.
If we could return it we would",1207612800,,158,4.3
8082862,5,B000B7MXC0,This dvd was given to family members as a gift. They all said they loved it. They keep it on in background during family events.,1201046400,,128,4.16
8082863,4,B000B7MXC0,"Since my current house has no fireplace, I bought 2 copies of this DVD and played them on my 40"" and 50"" TVs during the Christmas festivites. My guests were amused and impressed.",1199577600,,178,4.424242424242424
8082864,5,B000B7MXC0,"Unlike the earlier reviewer, I actually like this dvd! Okay, some of the sounds aren't 100 percent realistic, and the flames don't have a lot of variation. But the fact is that it's a dvd, not a fireplace, and it's just not going to be the same. The music tracks are annoying, but I play it with the ""crackling fire only"" track (& let the radio provide the music), and have found it a very soothing substitute to the fireplace I've been missing from my former (& much older) house. Also, rather than coming to an end, it plays over and over again in a half-hour long cycle. There is a bit of a pause as it starts its cycle over, but it's nothing that can't be lived with. I tend to play it on the widescreen tv in my living room, and even friends love it & request it when we're sitting around visiting!

So...if you're expecting this dvd to be so realistic that you forget it's a dvd and believe that your tv is on fire (such as there always seems to be in the backgrounds of scenes in post-apocalyptic-set movies), then you're not going to be happy. If, however, you just want a bit of ambience & have a sense of humour, then you'll get a kick out of this dvd and many hours of enjoyment for a bargain price. I'm putting 3 stars, but really would give it 3 1/2 if that option was available. 4 stars might be a bit much, but only because the sound quality would need to be just a bit better to deserve that. However, this dvd has brightened many a dull afternoon and evening, and makes a great backgroud effect for working/reading by, relaxing by, and when company is over. They laugh at it at first, but later can't help but admit that they love the idea!",1174435200,6,1657,4.2271293375394325
8082865,1,B000B7MXC0,"The price is OK, but otherwise I was disappointed in this DVD. The video image isn't particularly sharp and the flames are boringly consistent without any variation. The audio is just annoying. The crackling flames sound like surface noise from an old vinyl record and you'll not listen for long. The piano accompaniment consists of a single theme from a Mozart piano sonata endlessly repeated, and the guitar accompaniment too is just a few measures of something endlessly repeated. So the audio just gets on one's nerves and will soon be turned off.",1169078400,8,551,4.935483870967742
