1845342,3,B00008G83U,"Sure the playing is great but the video quality is poor and the sound is bad. The sound track is mono.  Shoddy camera work is annoying.  I'm going to order a different Freddie King now.  I wish Amazon would give more information about sound tracks, whether stereo, mono, 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS, etc.",1188000000,8,301,4.537037037037037
1845343,3,B00008G83U,"""A viewer's"" review pretty much sums up a lot for me about the audio quality.  It's unfortunate that the Montreux show has some tech. problems onstage, because it's the best audience he plays to in this collection.  The other two shows are from Sweden, and the audience just isn't in to it compared to the Swiss and other King DVD's from these years.  King and the band(tight as always) still give great shows, but the audience is really subdued.

""Live in Dallas"" is the still the best Freddie King DVD I've got.  This one makes a good companion DVD to the ""Sugar Bowl"" DVD, which is better.",1148774400,5,592,4.4953271028037385
1845344,1,B00008G83U,"Don't waste your money on this DVD. There is no tab and the ""closeups"" of Duke Robillaird's hands are shot from a poor angle so you can't tell what strings he's fretting. Suffice to say I am very disappointed.",1123286400,7,209,4.384615384615385
1845345,2,B00008G83U,"The problem with this series of guitar instructional material is the lack of accurate tab.  In the case of this particularly DVD, there is no tab; just a little useless booklet that gives a guide to notation and lists the chords used in the songs.  Also, it is advertised as giving a complete breakdown on playing the songs.  This is true except for the last one, Sen-sa-shun which is played straight through with the closing credits.

On the positive side, Duke Robillard's performance of the songs is superb and very inspiring, particularly The Stumble.  I recommend this to die-hard Freddie King fans and advanced guitar players but the lack of tablature will probably be a source of frustration to beginners.",1122854400,10,712,4.9

7983412,3,B00008G83U,"Not much tab other than a blues scale, but everything is well explained. Buy a tab book to go with this.",1473724800,,104,4.0

7983414,5,B00008G83U,"Duke Robillard has got the Master's touch on the feel of these tunes.  Hence; this is a Master Class.  I attended Classical Guitar Master Classes in College as a Guitar major.  If anyone was granted a master class with Andres Segovia, they wouldnt tell him he missed a note on a Bach Fugue. We MUST assume he didn't WANT to play it.  Dont let that deter you from owning one of these.
The value is in sitting in front of a master blues artist and getting his take on an IMPROVISED art form.  Dukes licks are soulful and right to the point.  If you want a note for note clone of Freddie's recordings get ""The Freddie King Collection"" from Hal Leonard, transcriptions by Kenn Chipkin. He does an amazing job on accuracy. Get them both and you have the best of both worlds.  The Producers did not put anything into the pamphlet that comes with the video. It's worthless, no notation or tabs.  Fair Warning: That's not what this is.  Its better .. This is a Master Class.  Duke plays Freddie King just GREAT! So much to learn for the observant bluesman.",1361836800,4,1048,4.411458333333333
7983415,5,B00008G83U,"This has been one of the most helpful instructional DVDs I've ever used (and believe me, I've tried a lot), so I'm very surprised at the negative reviews, but I suppose it has something to do with how you approach learning guitar. Most of the criticism seems to revolve around either the ""poor quality"" of the tab or the fact that Duke is not playing the licks identically to Freddie. For me, both of those complaints are non-issues. My feeling is that if you really need the tab to figure these things out, then playing Freddie's style might be a little bit beyond your playing level. I'm not saying you shouldn't try, but just be prepared for a little frustration along the way. And as far as Duke not playing the note-for-note licks, well, I guess I don't want to regurgitate Freddie's playing; I want to learn about his style so I can incorporate some of his techniques into my style (such as it is). And for doing that, Duke is brilliant; he captures Freddie's sound and feel beautifully.

Not to get too deep here, but I think both of those criticisms of this video reveal a subtle attitude that I find a little disturbing: that Freddie's songs are somehow ""museum pieces"" that have to be played exactly the way he did on the record in order to be ""correct."" The problem is that that's not what blues is all about for me. I want it to be living, breathing music that reflects whatever the player is feeling at the time. So, be warned: if you're looking for a sterile, clinical analysis of every little finger noise on the recorded version of these songs, then this is not the DVD for you. But if you've got the chops (and the ears) for it, prepare to learn a lot!",1306627200,2,1669,4.4188311688311686
7983416,1,B00008G83U,"I wanted to learn how to play The Stumble, so I purchased this DVD along with the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Freddie-King-Collection-Guitar-Recorded-Version/dp/0793565669/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Freddie King Collection (Guitar Recorded Version)</a>. What I quickly realized is that the book was very accurate, with just a few mistakes in the TAB, but the DVD was not accurate at all. Duke Robillard performs the song(s) well, but if you compare it to the Freddie King recording there are many differences. He also plays many notes in different positions than the book, making it difficult to use the DVD to complement the book. Listening to the Freddie King recording, I think the positions in the book are more accurate than what's on the DVD.

I said he ""performs"" the songs, which is really the biggest problem with this DVD. He's not really teaching you how to play the songs, he's showing you, but he often does not go slowly enough or provide enough explanation for you to be able to easily follow. I found myself having to constantly rewind the DVD to try to figure out what he was playing. A certain amount of rewinding is expected, but when I buy an instructional DVD I expect more instruction than this.

In the DVD case, there was a TAB key, which explained what certain TAB notations mean, but there was no TAB for the songs. Bizarre.

For these reasons the DVD was basically worthless to me. I used the book and the Freddie King recording (slowed down) to learn The Stumble.",1295395200,4,1551,5.122529644268774
7983417,1,B00008G83U,"This is the first review I have ever felt compelled to place on Amazon and that is because I want to save you from wasting your money. This DVD is the worst instructional DVD I have ever had the misfortune of buying. It is cheap, shoddy and without merit.
Firstly, only three songs are actually broken down piece by piece - that is they are played slowly, with almost nothing by way of explanation. Secondly, there is little attempt at accuracy. Thirdly, there is no discussion of Freddie King's style as such beyond a few token comments. Fourthly, there is no TAB at all. Fifthly, the actual footage of Freddie is so slight that if you blinked you'd miss it. Sixthly, there is scant mention of Freddie's equipment and the important contribution to his sound played by his wearing a thumb and finger pick. The production is so miserable that there isn't even a drumbeat let alone a drummer involved -and believe me it shows in the timing.
You'd be better watching a bad garage band perform these numbers rather than watch this DVD. If there are more uninspired, perfunctory performances of these pieces committed to DVD, I'd be surprised. It is low quality in every sense of the words. AVOID. Buy the book of tabs instead - a MUCH better investment!",1277337600,2,1249,4.63063063063063
7983418,5,B00008G83U,this is a must have item for Freddie King enthusiasts. The three performances flow well and are nothing short of entertaining. King lives up to his Texas Cannonball moniker. The band and King speak for themselves. Top notch quality,1270166400,,231,4.948717948717949
7983419,5,B00008G83U,"finally, a DVD that explains how to play my favorite Freddie King instrumental...Hideaway.  Duke Robillard (formerly of Roomfull of Blues) takes you through the instrumental and then breaks it down into parts that are easily learned.  My video (I have the video version) came with TAB.  This DVD along with the publication ""The Freddie King Collection,"" some time practicing and keeping in mind a key point made by Mr. Robillard - that these instrumentals are not meant to be copied note for note but are meant to be an inspiration for you to add your own flavor, flair or licks to the mix - combine to make this an excellent investment for someone trying to get an introduction to one of the greatest electric bluesman...Freddie King.  Highly recommended!",1237852800,9,756,4.8828125
7983420,4,B00008G83U,"I bought this after learning for only 9 months or so and like the others my first reaction was disappointment with the lack of tabs and explanation of chords etc. However, I've come back to this after nearly two years of learning and have learnt Hideaway and The Stumble from the DVD (the catch here though is that I bought the Freddie King Tab book as I couldn't find a decent tab for The Stumble).

Once you understand the I IV V progression and scale intervals and you've learnt some other blues songs, the DVD will be of immense benefit to learning these songs because you'll know what the instructor is talking about. Be aware that the on the DVD he may play the same notes as a tab you have but in a different position. In this sense too it forces you to use your ear which is good.

In my opinion the DVD is excellent for right level of experience or for those seeking a challenge. If you don't know what the instructor means, there's something new for you to find out.",1200873600,2,976,4.298913043478261
