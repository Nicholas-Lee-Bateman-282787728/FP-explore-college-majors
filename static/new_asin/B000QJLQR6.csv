8681222,3,B000QJLQR6,"First off, the movie is Excellent.  This review is a technical comparison of two different releases of the same film, ""Duplicate"" from 1988.

Eros NTSC format: Widescreen within the Pan and Scan 4:3 frame. If you have a 16:9 widescreen T.V., you will have to zoom in to fill the screen.  The title and introduction have black bars on top and bottom. Afterwards, the frame is cropped such that it will fill the entire zoomed in 16x9 frame.  Audio is a healthy 224 kb/s  in AC3. 2 hours 45 minutes of movie. The English subtitles stink: every word that has a ""t"" in it, is missing a ""t"", rendering it impossible to read.  Subtitles also lose sync as the film progresses. By the end of the film, the subs are totally worthless.

Sony/BMG licensed release, PAL format: True anamorphic widescreen. No funny business to get the right picture on a 16x9 widescreen t.v.  Top of movie is very slightly cropped... such that the top half of the first line of text in the ""Acknowledgments"" section is missing. So you know the rest of the film is missing a very tiny bit of the top due to cropping, but you won't really miss what you don't know you're missing. Even so, the Sony version has top and bottom black bars throughout the entire film, and keeps the aspect ratio of the original film version. There is much more detail in the periphery than on the Eros release. Very small black bar on the right of the screen; centering would have helped some. Audio has less resolution than Eros release, weighing in with a minimal 196 kb/s.  The bitrate for video and audio could have been pumped up a little: data fills up approximately 6 GB of space on an 9 GB disc, so there plenty of room to work with. Subtitles are perfect as far as readability and synchronization. A little more work could have been done to make the English subtitles understandable, but on the whole it was very satisfying. While this is a region 0 disc, most N. American consumers will not be able to play on their dvd players because of it being in PAL format. They will still need a multi-region player. Or a computer with a dvd-drive; they aren't such sticklers on format like the standalone players. Length of film is 2 hrs 38 min. The disparity in time between the PAL and NTSC releases is usually explained by the difference in frame rates. This version is 50 fps, the Eros release is 59.94 fps.  Sony/BMG, as usual, is quite solid.

This film deserves the Blu-Ray treatment, in both NTSC and PAL, with multi-language dubs even! Come on Sony!

I own both dvd versions, but did not buy them on Amazon. I submit this only to aid people trying to decide on the ""best"" (subjective) version to buy.",1381276800,,2657,4.4896265560165975
