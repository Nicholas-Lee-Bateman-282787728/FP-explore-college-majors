I did have an off TV recording of this, but I bought the VHS anyway when it first came out and I have never been sorry. This story has been remade in several different formats with many new and old actors since then, but it has never duplicated. This is the most underrated film ever made about the Apollo 13 disaster.  This is especially true if you were brought up in the 1960's and became accustomed to the mission voice of NASA on the TV and radio which permeates the entire film.  This movie was shot AT NASA with NASA people in the actual environment that existed at the time. The story focuses more on the controllers than on the astronauts, so the perspective is unique, and although the controller accounts that provide the background for the story are fictional, the mission exploits are factual and are very well (and simply) explained. With respect to Hanks and the modern crew, there is really no comparison (re acting abilities) when compared to Robert Culp, Clu Gulagher, Steve Frankein et al. I strongly recommend this movie as a wonderful way to spend an evening.  Share it with your kids and help invoke a great piece of history!",1306800000,,1218,4.5227272727272725
