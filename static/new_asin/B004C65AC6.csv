As I write this comment,  I am holding an audio cassette which I have carried since I left Lancashire via London to California too many years ago. On a whim I went to Amazon, who never ceases to amaze me, to find that I can donate my cassette to my local library and reconnect with George by buying the DVD on Amazon.

Americans never quite understood the London bombings of the Nazis ""Blitzkrieg"" and how London was in flames.  It was people like George Formby and others in cinema and on stage that made people laugh.  America had its funny folks also - but not the audience that really needed the kind of folks like Formby.  Formby, Arthur Askey, and many other did their part in creating a bit of laughter.  It gave people a sense of life.",1412294400,2,560,4.398058252427185
