8019646,3,B00020HEE8,"The footwork in this step video is pretty basic and uncomplicated, which is really nice for those of us who have two left feet.  The instructor works solo, without any background exercisers and cues pretty well, however, she yells out ""woooo"" quite frequently and it can really get on my nerves (she also frequently repeats the phrases ""keep going"" and ""great job"").  The set looks like it might be in an upscale house, on a tile floor in front of a very nice staircase.  The lighting is good.  The music is okay, although in a couple of spots it should probably have been a little louder.  Sometimes her steps echo a little.  I don't get the feeling this was a big budget production, however, the camera work in this is pretty well done - cutting to  her feet when she changes steps and staying focused on what she is doing (some of the big name professional instructors and their media departments should take a cue here).  If you can tolerate whooping, this is a nice little workout; on the other hand, if whooping aggravates you, pass this one by. I will probably keep this in my collection and use it occasionally, but I don't think it is something I would gravitate to regularly because of the wooo-hoos and that is why it only gets three stars.",1171670400,4,1251,4.504424778761062
