8436345,4,B004MYP0O6,"It starts slow.  It's all grainy footage from the various steps an exhibition goes through to be realized, so if you're not interested in that, this is a slow boat at first.  However, once Max Ernst comes in, it picks up quite a bit.  If you're reading this, you're probably interested in Max Ernst footage.  Happily, there's more than I expected.  He walks around the exhibit with wife Dorothea Tanning ( a brilliant artist in her own right) and rediscovers pieces from his past.  The best part is the opening night party thrown for Max, where people approach him with boring small talk and you can see his eyes gloss over.  At one point, someone mentions an artist that Max is passionate about, and you see him suddenly liven up, only to be disappointed by the lack of followup from the chatter.  I wish the film was longer, since there's so little footage of Max Ernst (and even less of Dorothea).  It's a fun watch once you get past the first ten minutes.",1463184000,,959,4.497109826589595
