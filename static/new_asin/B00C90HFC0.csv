8578806,4,B00C90HFC0,"I, like the other reviewer, also picked this up from the Walmart Discount Bin (for $3.74). My main reasoning is that this collection does have a few larger titles (particularly ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""House on Haunted Hill""), and buying them in this collection was cheaper than buying the two in separate disks. The other movies obviously aren't classics, but I wouldn't say their awful either. A good collection to get if you come across it for cheap like I did.",1447372800,,471,4.686746987951807
8578807,4,B00C90HFC0,"I'm being a little generous here giving this a 4 star rating.  If you've ever wondered why collections such as these can afford to pack so many titles in one package the answer is obvious, these are public domain movies that a distributor doesn't have to pay royalties.  As far as collections like this go this one is pretty small but good.  I've seen classic horror and sci fi collections that range from 50-100 total movies but the price tends to inflate a little more.  Most of them have fancier packaging than this one as well.  I bought my copy at a Wal-Mart bargain bin for 5 bucks.  Before you find yourself buying this I think you should ask yourself two questions, 1. Do I like old b-movies and 2. Have I seen all of the movies featured here.  With an exception here or there these aren't movies that demand repeat viewings.  You also might be disappoint that every movie featured here is in full frame rather than widescreen.  Some of the movies are obvious pan & scan vhs rips.  In at least one of the movies (and I can't remember which one) there is visible tracking distortion.  Issues aside if you haven't seen or don't have a copy of ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""House on Haunted Hill"", or ""Carnival of Souls"" I strongly suggest you buy this collection.  These are easily the best movies in this collection(but if you'd rather get special editions don't bother).  It also contains such curiosities as 1982's ""Blood Tide"" a boring ""Jaws"" ripoff with James Earl Jones and ""The Pyx"" a ""Rosemary's Baby"" ripoff with a heroine addicted prostitute.  It can be a great gift for anybody who loves an unusual or unique and of course bad movie.  I'm sure Drive-In, Mystery Science Theater, and Rifftrax fans will enjoy it.
