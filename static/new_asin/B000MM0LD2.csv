8169839,5,B000MM0LD2,"I had ordered the work out becasue I been out of working out for some time and i wanted to get back in the swing of things, so I saw this dvd of sugar ray and Lalia so I ordered the dvd and gave it a try. I try it and I love the workout it was a challenge but I enjoy it. Great DVD workout.",1311120000,2,290,3.409090909090909
8169840,4,B000MM0LD2,"After working out with the first video, this was a good step 2.
More moves more sweating.  I enjoyed working out with this video.
I like the boxing as an alternate for cardio.",1282521600,,175,4.303030303030303
8169841,5,B000MM0LD2,"This is a short, but effective workout.  I like doing it on days when I don't have enough time to do a full workout, or when I'm too sore to lift weights!",1234224000,2,154,3.8125
8169842,3,B000MM0LD2,"I purchased the 2 pack and wrote a review for the beginner dvd.  Unfortunately there is not much difference in the two DVD's other than different outfits so there isn't much more to say.

This is a very simple basic workout.  Do not be scared by the fact that it's led by Laila Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard. Anyone with no major physical impairments should be able to do this workout.  I'm not sure why they're doing the video, but neither of them are motivational.  The lack of energy Laila displays is shocking; especially after watching her on Dancing with the Stars.

I will give them credit for putting together a good quality dvd from the standpoint of cueing, cameral work, sound, equal reps on each side... I have no issues with any of those things.",1221955200,2,754,4.507352941176471
8169843,1,B000MM0LD2,"Let me preface this with the information that I work out a lot. I work out at home with DVD's a lot and have had several different instructors. I'm relatively fit and am on the verge of being advanced. I purchased this DVD to help me move on to the next level of fitness.

The moves seem easy enough and I've boxed with the Kathy Smith Cardioboxing workout before. However, this left a lot to be desired. I don't have the beginner workout and maybe I'd be less confused if I had it, but I turned off this DVD after 10 minutes. Laila speaks very little if only to tell you that the next thing is coming up. Then the next move comes up and it's so quick that you can't get it for 2 or 3 times through the repitition and by then it's almost over. There was no discussion of proper form or exactly what the heck we were doing! When I start a work out I don't want to stand and watch a discussion on how to do the moves, no workout should be that complicated and apparently this one is! If you want an awesome boxing workout- get the Kathy Smith DVD instead!",1204070400,10,1053,4.086956521739131
8169844,3,B000MM0LD2,"Please be warned: this is not a 30-minute workout like the description makes it out to be.  The DVD is only 24 minutes long; the first five minutes are spent doing various warm-up exercises, as are the last five minutes, so there are truly only 14 minutes of ""real"" exercise!  I was fantastically disappointed with this.

The workout itself is fine, if only more of a ""moderate"" workout for one who is considered advanced and has been exercising for a while.  Laila leads you through various standing and floor exercises, but by the time your heart rate gets up, it's over.",1203120000,2,573,4.643564356435643
8169845,5,B000MM0LD2,"I purchased this DVD in early June.  I started using it three days a week, beginning with the begginers DVD.  I loved it right away, it was a great workout for someone who hadn't worked out in a while.  I started the advanced over this weekend, and boy what a work out.  It is fast paced and I enjoy it very much.  The thing I love the most is, you're doing some basic moves but you really feel like you're working your entire body.  This DVD keeps me motivated like no other that I've tried because I enjoy learning the boxing moves.  I highly recommed this to anyone looking for a new challenge.",1185148800,10,597,4.230088495575221
