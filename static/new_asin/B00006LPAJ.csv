7972131,5,B00006LPAJ,"I used to have Lilo & Stitch and Monsters Inc. read along DVDS. Sadly, we sold them at the flea market. I thought I would get this so  that I would write the story down in French & Italian whenever I don't have a computer or this or even both. And so that it would help me with my French & Italian.",1396828800,,298,3.806451612903226
7972132,3,B00006LPAJ,"""A Pleasant Surprise""

This DVD was not what I expected, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  My Disney princess fan is a preschooler, but she still enjoyed it.  I think children who are learning to read or can read already would appreciate it more.  It has 7 sections available in 5 languages, such as English, French, and Spanish.  The sections are:

THE STORY - an abridged version of the animated movie that still provides lots of story detail.  Still pictures flash by at a good clip while the words to the story are shown on the bottom of the screen.

THE SONGS - includes the famous song ""Be Our Guest"" with lyrics shown below still pictures so you can sing along.

MUSIC VIDEOS - has an upbeat version of theme song ""Beauty and the Beast"" sung by an energetic teen group called Jump 5 accompanied by animated objects from the castle.  Also includes the ballad ""As Long As There's Christmas"" sung by Roberta Flack and Peabo Bryson.

VOCABULARY - learn to read the name of your favorite movie character. Shows pictures with the printed word below.

THE MAGIC WORLD OF DISNEY - trailers for Disney movies

SEARCH THE WEB

GAMES - only 1 game actually available.  Play a memory game called ""Hide and Seek"" in a room in the castle. The Beast's Magic Mirror first shows a character from the movie.  Then you guess in which of the seven places (indicated by Mickey Mouse ears) that character is hiding.  Both my girls liked playing this game.",1090713600,9,1452,4.544401544401544
7972133,5,B00006LPAJ,"I am really glad they made this Read Along DVD for Beauty and the Beast! It is really great and the kids love it! :)
Thank GOD! They added the Original Version of ""As Long As There's Christmas"" Video from the Beauty And The Beast Enchanted Christmas! I think Disney forgot to add this video to there Special Edition Release! :)
Well, if you are looking for the Original Version of ""As Long As There's Christmas"", you will sure to find it on this DVD! :)
I believe they had every right to add this video on here because I am a big fan of everything that is Beauty and the Beast and I really wanted this video! So do not mind that other Review!",1060992000,4,642,4.144
7972134,1,B00006LPAJ,"How DARE they put music from THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS on this
DVD! See,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is my favorite movie. I have seen
it four hundred and forty-seven times. That said,I strongly
objected to material from THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS being allowed
herein. The sheer soullessness of this move makes me SO angry.",1051574400,2,311,5.0
