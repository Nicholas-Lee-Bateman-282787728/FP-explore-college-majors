3052752,5,B0010X5JCU,I fully enjoy Mr. Clarke's work. I enjoy watching him on TV which is why I purchased this video. I would recommend this video to anyone who likes watching him. It is every bit as good as his tv shows and you get to see some of our own country through his eyes.,1366329600,3,260,3.9245283018867925
3052753,4,B0010X5JCU,A very good guide for learning watercolor painting as a hobby.  Would suggest viewing the Simply Painting Introduction to Watercolors.  The two DVDs provide an excellent introduction to hobby painting.,1337644800,9,201,5.666666666666667
3052754,5,B0010X5JCU,"I came cross Frank Clarke's Painting the northeast by accident.  I already had several excellent watercolor, pastel and collage dvds. I purchased this one because it was a great buy for 2 dvds, and I thought it was acrylic. I love Maine and it was nice to see some familiar places as well as places I still want to visit. I found Frank Clarke enjoyable, entertaining and informative, a great beginner instructor.  I'm considering being certified in his technique just because he make's painting what it should be-fun.",1246406400,13,517,4.863636363636363
3052755,5,B0010X5JCU,I spent $158 for a community college watercolor course and was so disapponted because I expected the quality of the watercolor classes to be similar to Frank Clarke - they weren't and from now on I'm investing my money in Frank Clarke's lessons.  He is a true teacher.  I bring the videos over to my children's home and we spend a wonderful Sunday afternoons creating beautiful paintings having our own watercolor workshop with Frank Clarke.  G-d sure knew what G-d was doing when G-d created Frank Clarke!!!  Thank you so much Mr. Clarke - you are the BEST teacher by far.,1209600000,24,573,4.643564356435643

8238839,5,B0010X5JCU,"Be ready to hit the pause button, and be sure to have a hairdryer on hand. It's like sitting down with a friend who tells stories and pretty much remembers to tell you how to paint these simple scenes.",1442966400,,201,4.17948717948718
8238840,5,B0010X5JCU,"This was a great DVD. Frank Clarke's teaching style is easy to follow and I was able to follow along and reproduce the paintings (not as well as he did of course, I need more practice before I get to that level).  This DVD definitely helped to improve my own painting.  I particularly liked the fact that he uses a limited number of paints (6) and brushes (3). If you are a beginner, get this DVD and you will be very happy with the results.",1433721600,,441,4.176470588235294

8238842,5,B0010X5JCU,Frank Clarke with his delightful stories of the area he is painting makes you feel a relationship with the painting he will be doing.  His instructions are easy to follow and very informative to what are the best techniques for painting.,1427587200,,237,4.780487804878049
8238843,4,B0010X5JCU,"Simply painting by Frank Clarke is a very good DVD for water coloring.
I like his simple style of painting an being new to watercolor painting I can follow
his pictures.  I also order volume 2. Each DVD comes with almost a dozen pictures.
Happy Painting Verna",1423008000,,259,4.51063829787234

8238845,4,B0010X5JCU,Great book and artist. I did not like watercolor until now. Everybody should try his method. It is so very rrwarding.,1402358400,,117,4.619047619047619
8238846,5,B0010X5JCU,"One of the best aspects of these DVD's is the number of paintings that he does.  I sketched while watching them and will complete them, then watch again to critique my work.  He is very laid-back and enjoyable to watch and listen to, and has a good technique.",1373846400,2,259,4.375
