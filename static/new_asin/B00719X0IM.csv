8508056,5,B00719X0IM,"I purchased this series after I finished the Worship Bass Beginner's course.  It picks up nicely where that leaves off and allows you to continue working on timing, arpeggios, 16th notes, 10ths, pick style playing, and so on while you are learning songs.  I also used it a couple of time when I was playing a song for church that week (particularly ""Indescrible"" with it's 6/8 time).

I am a HUGE Musicademy fan and can't say enough good things about them!",1364860800,,456,4.604938271604938
