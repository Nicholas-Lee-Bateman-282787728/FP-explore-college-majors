5688919,4,B00C2QNBE2,the 4th movie in the set is not the unrated one which is better so make sure you buy the unrated version to replace it with this one,1371254400,11,132,3.75
5688920,2,B00C2QNBE2,"Been there, seen that. This applies to this disappointing third set of Die Hard films on blu ray (the ""Legacy"" collection...what a play on words). Sad to say it, I am a fool for buying all three hoping the last two are newer remasters. Especially after seeing all five Die Hard films at the Die Hard Movie Marathon last February (in wake of the fifth one being released to theaters). I had already purchased the 25th Anniversary set before this and very disappointed Fox used transfers from 2007 that looked (and still does) cruddy for blu ray. I was shocked (and excited) to learn the five Die Hard films were projected digitally from new transfers for the movie marathon. I could not believe how wonderful and detailed these first three films finally looked! The fourth always looked pretty decent for todays standard. And when I heard that Fox was releasing a THIRD box set of the films (including A Good Day To Die Hard) I knew these HAD to be from the 2012 beautiful transfers. Not so!!! What is Fox holding onto these new transfers for!? I have wasted many of my hard earned dollars hoping and wishing for 4K transfers by todays standards. The old 2007 transfers look like DVD upconverted (again, and again!). Forgive me folks, but I am a Die Hard franchise fan and enjoy watching these. I just didn't want to come off being picky (which I am) but enough is enough!! I don't mind Die Hard 4 is the PG-13 version, I just want these films to look and sound gorgeous like they did at the multiplex that one day in February 2013.
All four films (I will get to the fifth in a second) are the same exact discs except the cover of each disc has changed (must be cheap for Fox to slap on new labels to rehash discs). A Good Day To Die Hard disc is a shame! It is only the theatrical movie and NO extended cut and NO special features (NOT ONE! Looks like this is the disc Redbox will be getting). And the packaging is the worst!! The discs are sliders. You must slide them out of cardboard holders (like most Fox blu ray box sets) and three discs I had to pry out from being stuck.
Another sad release for a wonderful franchise that deserves to look and sound better on our home theater systems. If you can get this for twenty bucks and don't own one of these three sets, go for it. Us true fans need to avoid at ALL cost!! Maybe when Die Hard 6 gets released will we be blessed with new transfers? I am one fan not holding my breath.  :(",1371081600,46,2435,4.316593886462882

5688922,5,B00C2QNBE2,Great collection addition.,1449360000,,26,8.0
5688923,3,B00C2QNBE2,"The movies are Great - Good.  I have been a Die Hard fan since day one.  This box set is terrible.  It arrived semi crushed from within a padded envelope.  Granted the entire box is made of paper, not even a plastic holder or hub.  Even still, two of the five Blu-ray discs had fallen through the case/holder and nearly hit the floor when I opened it.  If you just want the movies the price is phenomenal.  If you are looking for something else... it's not in here.  As the many other reviewers state no frills, no extras, and only the Theatrical Releases.  I bought a empty 6-disk Blu-ray case and plan to salvage and cut up what's left of the cheap, flimsy, paper box set to make something out of it.  Besides negotiations for a Bruce Willis, Die Hard 6 are already underway.",1425859200,,777,4.333333333333333
5688924,4,B00C2QNBE2,You can't go wrong with any of the Die Hard Movies.... Only negative is the way they packaged the Blue Ray Discs... Other than that ..... Great quality,1423008000,,151,4.428571428571429
5688925,3,B00C2QNBE2,"Bluray movies are good, but as others have said, the packaging is horrible. Probably the worst packaging since I got my Battlestar Galatica HD DVD season 1 set.",1420416000,,160,4.75
5688926,5,B00C2QNBE2,I love all movies with Bruce Willis and this collection is the best one in action.,1417305600,,82,4.1875
5688927,3,B00C2QNBE2,Package came in smushed and damaged. The movies itself were luckily in tact. But box looks bad now that its smashed up.,1416787200,,119,4.454545454545454
5688928,1,B00C2QNBE2,Two movies froze when playing! Not satisfied.,1415750400,,45,5.571428571428571
5688929,4,B00C2QNBE2,All parts of classic action movie in HD quality -- that's makes me happy. But as mentioned in previous comments the box really awful. Luckily I have plastic blu ray boxes to place the discs.,1411689600,,190,4.457142857142857
5688930,4,B00C2QNBE2,"Great movies even the last Die Hard which I never saw in theaters.  In all honesty though the packaging is subpar.  I purchased it used and a buddy of mine has the same box set and the same thing happens two both of ours BOOM , wait what yes the boxes go flat on the set not from anything sitting on them or anything of the sort just from wear and tear and just how bad Fox did this.

Secondly; Die Hard five is not the unrated kinda shocking but no other movies in the set are so I guess Fox wanted to marketed it as such for whatever that is worth.

Third: First Die Hard film mostly everyone's favorite is stuffed in the back on the first fold behind the second film ??? Really the reason most of us starting watching and loving the Die Hard films is stuffed in the back ?  Come on get it together Fox.

Still the set is very affordable and you do get all the films.  Big plus just wish the packaging and organization of the set would have been handled better .",1408492800,,964,4.042105263157895
5688931,5,B00C2QNBE2,Fast shipping. Recommend great movie collection. Get them all in this collection. Each movie is great each one get's better,1395878400,,123,5.2
5688932,3,B00C2QNBE2,"The movies themselves are alright, pretty bare bones in terms of extras and quality.  The packaging is terribly designed, seriously awful.  The discs are tucked into little flaps, and they are not in any way protected since the cardboard flaps fall apart (ours weren't holding the discs when we got them, they had all fallen into the packaging.",1394409600,3,344,4.913793103448276
5688933,5,B00C2QNBE2,"great movie, would recommend to anyone.

as with most movies, it is not for everyone, but it is for you if you have any taste!  : )",1392854400,,131,3.814814814814815
5688934,4,B00C2QNBE2,Seen them all. Love them all. Only complaint is that the package is made very cheap! I had to replace the inside cardboard sleeve with regular blu-ray cases,1392681600,,156,4.607142857142857
5688935,5,B00C2QNBE2,I purchased this as a Christmas gift. The recipient was very excited to receive it and appears to be very pleased.,1391299200,,114,4.476190476190476
5688936,1,B00C2QNBE2,"Where to begin...
First, the overall quality of package was garbage. The discs were held in place by cardboard flaps. Most of them fell apart when I opened the package and the discs flopped out, or the discs were stuck to the cardboard flaps by the glue meant to hold the damn flaps to the pack. Ugh, I hate that.
Second, Live Free or Die Hard or Die Hard 4.0 in some regions, is still not uncut on Blu-ray in this region. With this being the third collection release for the Die Hard Collection, there's no excuse. If that wasn't enough, A Good Day to Die Hard was stripped down to nothing. Special Features were all but non-existent, and guess what, no Unrated Cut. Its on the single release but not here. Also, the great Decoding Die Hard disc in the 25th Anniversary Collection, kiss that goodbye, it's gone too.
Lastly, I'm just a consumer, trying to do a solid for others out there. This pack is not worth the crappy cardboard its printed on. If you have the original Die Hard collection in the Blu-ray case, keep it and buy A Good Day to Die Hard separately. If you have the 25th Anniversary Collection, even better (can't stress how awesome the Decoding disc is), buy A Good Day to Die Hard separately. Dear reader, don't buy this garbage collection, if I could give it ZERO stars I would.",1387670400,16,1297,4.430962343096234
5688937,5,B00C2QNBE2,"Decent packaging, would have been better if the discs came in slim cases at least, but it works as it is.  Excellent flicks!",1386288000,,124,4.391304347826087
5688938,3,B00C2QNBE2,"Ok, I love the Die Hard movies, but this box set makes it look like all the videos were boot legged out of the back of a theater.  The ""blue-rays"" were more like grainy beta tapes.  Don't buy this box set, you would be better off buying each individual movie.",1375142400,4,259,4.16
5688939,1,B00C2QNBE2,"i buy a lot of box sets never had a cheap set .
this is maid sooooo cheap . they just slap sum cardboard together .
if this the way FOX is making box sets this my last one i buy from this company .",1374278400,,197,3.4
5688940,2,B00C2QNBE2,"well here's another fine mess 20th century has got us into. As reported, an inferior version of the 4th film, a bare bones version of the 5th, and without the bonus disc that comes along on the set with the first 4 only!  Luckily I picked this up at a local used DVD store and will happily be able to return it.  We will all need to wait for what will hopefully be the definitive , remastered set...

8576610,1,B00C2QNBE2,"Unfortunately I am just now finding out that the 4th disk, Die Hard 4.0, is region B specific Blu-ray required. I have attempted to use the the various methods that can be used to make this disk play; however, it will not. I am VERY unhappy with this since all of the other disks will play and are not region B specific.

I mean who does that? Put one disk in that won't work with the same player as all of the others? As I mentioned I am VERY, VERY unhappy.",1519689600,,458,4.032967032967033
