4295505,5,B004A6KJKQ,"I love this dvd, I think its the best gentle yoga I have ever done, I think the best is that its Christ Centered, and the teacher is amazing.  I would rate this a 100 out of 1-100...",1308268800,24,182,3.789473684210526
4295506,1,B004A6KJKQ,"I am only giving it one star because it plays up until 27 min then it stops, seems I got a defective dvd",1423872000,,104,3.5652173913043477
4295507,5,B004A6KJKQ,A wonderful workout that is both restorative and invigorating. People can push themselves into deeper stretches or modify according to their level.,1423526400,,147,5.7272727272727275
4295508,5,B004A6KJKQ,Enjoy this yoga dvd,1416787200,,19,4.0
4295509,4,B004A6KJKQ,"This is the first time I have ever done yoga, and I wanted something Christian based. I have really enjoyed it so far. I have noticed that my back is not so stiff after I do the routine.",1406764800,3,186,3.9210526315789473
4295510,5,B004A6KJKQ,Excellent! I'm new to yoga but not to faith. Before finding this dvd I was learning yoga from youtube videos which were helpful for learning positioning but doing nothing for my walk with God. This dvd provides clear instruction with subtle worship music in the background. The narration provides great step-by-step instruction so you don't have to watch the screen at all times to understand the position she is instructing you to change to.,1404950400,6,442,4.986486486486487
4295511,3,B004A6KJKQ,Great workout and love the Christian aspect of the yoga but... there's only 1 class on the DVD.  Was hoping for more.,1404691200,6,117,4.318181818181818
4295512,5,B004A6KJKQ,"Perfect DVD for my yoga needs.  Great positions, I like the scriptures and the music selections. Awesome customer service shown by replacing the copy I received with bad audio.  The replacement DVD is perfect.",1394409600,2,209,5.117647058823529
4295513,5,B004A6KJKQ,"Wow, to get a Christian Yoga program that is spirit filled is a joy to me. I highly recommend this CD.",1393200000,2,102,3.9047619047619047
4295514,4,B004A6KJKQ,I enjoy the video and the people I gave it to seem to also find it beneficial.  I appreciate the Christian emphasis and think it is a workout good for my age.,1390262400,3,158,3.9375
4295515,5,B004A6KJKQ,"I have never done yoga before and was looking for something that was easy to do.  I found it in this DVD.  As part of my New Year resolutions, I am trying to work on exercising more and eating less.  I find the music to be soothing and calming.  It is a good experience for a first timer!",1390003200,2,288,3.913793103448276
4295516,5,B004A6KJKQ,"This is a wonderful Christian yoga video that leads you into a quiet relaxation. The instructor does a wonderful job of directing you into positions without the need for the student to look at the video....the direction is great, music relaxing, scripture encouraging. I would recommend this video for beginners-intermediate yoga students who desire a Christ-centered experience in yoga.",1375056000,16,387,5.576271186440678
4295517,5,B004A6KJKQ,I love having this DVD in my collection for the days when I truly want to experience my practice. The instructions are detailed but without lots of distracting words and talking. Incredibly relaxing music. Perfect for an everyday practice DVD.,1374019200,6,243,5.1
4295518,3,B004A6KJKQ,This video jumps right into the yoga routine with no intro to explain the different poses and how to do them.  It moves very quickly and it is impossible to watch the video to follow what is going on when you are laying on a mat on the floor trying to do the yoga.  I found this very frustrating overall.,1373932800,30,304,4.05
4295519,5,B004A6KJKQ,"I highly recommend this dvd for any one who wants to start practicing yoga or keep up their practice.  This dvd is wonderful for beginners and even the most advanced in yoga practice.  I am fortunate to practice at the Yahweh Yoga studio in Arizona with the instructors who lead and narrate in this video.  I can honestly say that are truly amazing individuals.  When I travel, I make sure to bring this dvd with me so I don't loose practice time.  The best part of this dvd, aside from the amazing exercise, is the experience.  You feel energized and confidant in your abilities.  This is a must have for ANY person looking to explore yoga or continue their practice!  Check out their website at [...] for other dvd's.  They are all wonderfully made and choreographed.",1373155200,15,769,4.595588235294118
4295520,5,B004A6KJKQ,"I have used this video for 2 weeks, and I love it! I am basically a beginner to yoga, and the instructor is correct, the postures are becoming easier daily. I usually have a hard time getting myself to exercise, but I am daily looking forward to this!",1360800000,13,251,4.25
4295521,5,B004A6KJKQ,"Wife will enjoy even though she wasn't too surprised, she makes an Amazon wish list and I just go to it and order everything, long as she's happy. Thanks for good product.",1357344000,3,171,4.375
4295522,5,B004A6KJKQ,"This is my go-to recommendation for my students, beginners AND advanced. You absolutely WILL get sweaty and detoxified, yet feel calmer and more peaceful...and the core work will astound you. Seriously. Not to mention the fact that the scripture and the music are such a wonderful way to usher God's Presence in...or maybe I should say, to usher US into HIS presence, since He never leaves us. =-) If there were more stars to give, I would give them!",1356912000,19,450,4.708860759493671
4295523,4,B004A6KJKQ,"Easy to follow, soothing music. Not preachy but a nice background of Christian music. A good workout - takes about an hour.",1353888000,7,123,4.636363636363637
4295524,5,B004A6KJKQ,"This is a wonderful way for Christians to practice yoga.  It opens and closes with a passage from scripture, and has Christian music playing softly in the background.  The whole experience is soothing.  The workout is wonderful - plenty of different poses, both regular and modified demonstrated, and challenge without extreme difficulty.  This makes you feel so good you won't want to start your day without it.  I can't wait for Gentle Journey II to arrive!",1346803200,33,459,4.9868421052631575
4295525,5,B004A6KJKQ,"This is an awesome Christ-centered practice, and I highly recommend this DVD when you are unable to make it to an actual Christ-centered yoga class. The instructors voice is so soothing, and the music totally centers me. I truly feel as though I am in worship while I practice my postures! A must have for all yogis.",1309564800,36,316,4.56140350877193
8419539,1,B004A6KJKQ,Audio horrible...very disappointed.  Was hopeful to find a Christian based yoga practice but not with this dvd...my search will continue!,1516233600,,137,5.85
8419540,3,B004A6KJKQ,I should have gotten a more difficult one.  It's fine for what it is.,1504224000,,69,3.9285714285714284
8419541,1,B004A6KJKQ,Very disappointing,1472601600,,18,8.5
8419542,5,B004A6KJKQ,Wonderful way to do yoga! Thank you and God bless!,1471392000,,50,4.1
8419543,5,B004A6KJKQ,"Great DVD, love the Christ -centered approach! Great customer service!",1470787200,,70,6.1
8419544,1,B004A6KJKQ,"I  was warned by the Holy Spirit about the dangers of practicing yoga a few years back. Foolishly I bought into the lie that slapping God's name ahead of yoga, using scripture and Christian songs would make it okay. It's not okay. The enemy comes as an angel of light. His oldest trick is to make us think something is good for us when it's clearly not. I strongly urge anyone considering yoga to seek wisdom and discernment before purchasing.",1460592000,6,443,4.5375
8419545,5,B004A6KJKQ,The first DVD that came would not play so the company sent me a new one- so kudos for their customer service. Got it for my mom who has rheumatoid arthritis and she loves it because its slow and teaches a beginner how to do things. I wanted the Christian version of yoga so that it could be part of her quiet time and not introduce Buddhist practices.,1460246400,4,351,4.176470588235294
8419546,4,B004A6KJKQ,Came in good condition,1456790400,,22,4.75
8419547,1,B004A6KJKQ,"Once upon a time i posted a review about how terrible this DVD was, because it's basically old ladies laying in a park for the entire time doing no exercise - a total waste of money. Then after i was contacted and offered a refund and told that they were sorry that i wasn't satisfied. Then i was never issued the refund and totally ignored, so here i am again! Don't waste your money on this NON exercise DVD - you can watch people lay around for free in public if that's what you're into.",1431561600,,490,4.168421052631579
8419548,5,B004A6KJKQ,my mom loves this one so I got it for her,1426032000,,41,2.8181818181818183
