8227451,4,B000XA0LF6,"Although I liked the series very much, I can't review the actual item because my orders from two different sellers have been cancelled.  I would like to purchase the series before it goes out of print, but I am not willing to pay over $100.  I will wait to see if any seller can offer it at a price I can afford.",1369267200,,312,4.016129032258065
8227452,2,B000XA0LF6,If you don't speak or understand korean don't buy this DVD. The english subtitles suck big time. Its very hard to follow up with the story although the series inteslf is nice.,1298764800,,175,4.5
8227453,3,B000XA0LF6,"I love this drama and was excited to find I could get some on amazon, but I have to say the captioning is bad. You can understand it, but sometimes you would have to assume or try to make something out. What helped me was that I have seen it once before (captioning was much better) which has helped, but the drama itself is good, so I gave it three stars.",1257897600,,356,4.028169014084507
