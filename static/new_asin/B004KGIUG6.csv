8432938,5,B004KGIUG6,"I'd recommend Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman's Manufacturing Consent and also Edward Bernays' Propaganda to accompany The Trap. I thought I'd post here to advise that to the best of my knowledge these films have never been released by the BBC, this may account for quality issues customers seem to have been experiencing.
I'd advise anyone who wants to watch these films that they are on Youtube and Vimeo. Adam Curtis' are some of the most interesting and thought provoking documentaries I have ever seen. The Trap, The Century of The Self, The Power of Nightmares, The Machines of Loving Grace are absolutley essential. The Mayfair Set is also not to be missed, just make sure you watch the others first.",1359244800,,709,4.819672131147541
8432939,5,B004KGIUG6,"This series is very hard to find because Adam Curtis' used so much Public Domain footage that copyrighting the work proved impossible.  Therefor, most of these copies are from second hand sources...So, this is about as good as the quality gets and you ABSOLUTELY must own and watch this documentary.

In the cold war paranoia made sense, but a bold new documentary argues that the west has become trapped in a false idea of what it means to be human.

This is an audacious hypothesis, even by the standards of the documentary-maker involved, Adam Curtis, whose 2004 series The Power Of Nightmares asserted that al-Qaida, as an organised entity, was essentially an invention of the west. The new series, The Trap: What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom, argues that we have unwittingly subscribed to a bleak ideal of liberty that has, ironically, ""become our cage"", reducing our true freedom and fuelling a dramatic rise in inequality.

Critics will probably accuse Curtis, as they did after The Power of Nightmares, of being paranoid himself - of seeing in government policies a sinister plot to control the populace by tricking them. ""But I've never believed that anyone's bad,"" the 51-year-old Curtis insists, bouncing restlessly around the Soho office where he's editing the series. ""People do bad things because they're forced into circumstances.",1316044800,,1349,5.090497737556561
8432940,1,B004KGIUG6,"Completely agree with jose.r-s. Picture quality isn't the best and I had the same problem with part 3 i.e. no picture, but with audio. I was offered a replacement, and annoyingly Amazon tried to charge my credit card without my consent. This was supposedly to cover customs clearance procedures and was assured that it would be refunded immediately. I decided to not go with a replacement and was refunded promptly.

On a side note; I also purchased 'The Power of Nightmares' from the same company (PD Productions) and was very happy with picture and audio quality.",1307318400,,565,4.885416666666667
8432941,1,B004KGIUG6,"The documentary is quite good and I could discuss it more.
However, I would like to warn people about the quality of this
edition. It is quite bad. I actually ended up returning
the DVD. The last episode had no image, only audio!
and it was the audio of the first episode.
I understand there are other editions of this
documentary, buy those and avoid buying this one.
It seems this documentary is being packaged by several
different companies. Unfortunately I ended up with the
crappy one.",1306800000,4,490,4.64367816091954
