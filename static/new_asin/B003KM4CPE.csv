However, when I tried to play this DVD (and trust me, after NUMEROUS FRUSTRATING...pausing, erratically freezing, skipping, etc. etc. moments - followed by a thorough CLEANING of the DVD just in case there were scratches that existed that were not visible just by looking at the underside of the disc....) I was ready to FLIP OUT and toss this horrible waste of money into the trash! But I chose to persevere because I REALLY REALLY WANTED this DVD to play and work like any other normal DVD...so I repeated rechecking the disc for scratches, followed by a another cleaning; and fully using the power of positive thinking that THIS TIME IT WILL WORK because I refuse to let this mere DVD get the best of me! And for those who are wondering if I checked my DVD player - yep I did and it worked perfectly when I put in a different disc so thankfully this wasn't the issue.  I even did that weird thing that most of us do when having problems with technology, I opened the DVD drawer and blew into it.  I don't really know if this actually does anything beneficial, but at least I can feel good knowing I didn't leave out any steps.

So, I took a deep breath, poured myself a delicious glass of Cabernet Sauvignon to calm my aggravated nerves; I tried to play it again and realized that my continuing to desperately get a poorly manufactured DVD to work no matter how much I wanted it to....was a complete effort in futility.  I wasted lots of time and got nowhere.  Returning ""Just the Facts: Inventors: The Life and Mind of Albert Einstein"" is more effort than it is worth and I'm glad that I didn't purchase more of the DVD's in this series.",1346371200,,1765,4.432098765432099
