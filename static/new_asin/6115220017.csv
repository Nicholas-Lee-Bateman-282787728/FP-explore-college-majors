208228,5,6115220017,"I love this drama, which has my favorite Kpop group members from SHINee and EXO!!!! In the first DVD at the end of the 4th episode the audio and visual started to play at different speeds, but I was able to understand. I really love that case because it's sturdy and will last long. The seller is great and I recommend this drama to everyone!",1386374400,2,342,4.276923076923077
208229,5,6115220017,"Gu Jae Hee, is set on transferring to an all-male prep school. Her goal is to rehabilitate and encourage her idol, Kang Tae Joon, to get back to his beloved sport that he so suddenly retreated from. Disguised as a boy, she infiltrates the school and is surrounded by heartthrobs and even becomes Kang Tae Joon's roommate. Pretending to be a boy in an all male school won't be easy, especially when she falls in love with Kang Tae Joon.

This drama is filled with talented K-Pop singers! They're all great actors. The shows funny and heart-warming. The fun, interesting story line will keep you watching and even have you laughing out loud. The music is so awesome on this show, it made my heart pound. I have all the songs on my iPod. This show is also called ""To the Beautiful You.""",1382227200,3,783,4.475524475524476
208230,5,6115220017,"This drama is so cute. Its a very teen drama and its alot like the manga series. I've seen both the Japanese and the Korean version, but I think my favorite is the Korean one. The cast is great and the show has alot of funny and romantic scenes on it. I saw it online and I knew I had to get it for my own. The episodes show well and the subtitles too. I arrived ahead of time which made me very happy.",1382054400,3,402,3.7976190476190474
208231,5,6115220017,"This was a very good adaptation of the manga Hanazakari no Kimitachie by Nakajo Hisaya.  It was actually closer to the manga than either of the Japanese drama adaptations.

The story stars Min Ho from SHINee, and while he is not as charismatic as Oguri Shun (who plays Sano Izumi in the first Japanese version), he is a good choice for Sano Izumi (Kang Tae Jun in the Korean version).  My favourite character will always be Nakatsu Shuichi (Cha Eun Kyul), who does a lot of soul searching when he finds himself attracted to a ""boy"".

I definitely recommend this drama for a fun ""girl pretending to be a boy"" story.",1371600000,4,614,4.504504504504505

7802720,5,6115220017,"Despite being a high school drama, it's a fun and sweet story for all ages.  The gender-bender plot twist gave it interesting storyline. How does a romance develop between a girl and guy if the guy thinks that she is a ""he""?  Well, watch and find out.

As another reviewer mentioned, it has a catchy soundtrack which supports the various scenes well.  All the characters in the story were memorable and developed.  There were many funny moments that had me laughing hard, mostly the scenes with the other would-be romantic guy interest, Cha Eun Gyeol. Despite the predictable ending, I was rooting for him actually.  There was a goofy, genuine and self-less kindness to his character that would win anyone over.

The male hero, Kang Tae Joon, surprisingly had an all-around nice personality, though he was guarded initially.  There was none of the ""nice guy vs. mean guy""(who all the girls inexplicably are attracted to) dynamic that's portrayed a great deal on TV.

The heroine in disguise was beautifully cast to play the pretty androgynous Goo Jae Hee.  Part of the comedy was watching her occasionally forget to act like a boy and watching the resulting confusion on her male counterparts faces.

My only peeve was that the last episode could have been more 'complete'.  It felt like they rushed to end the series and forgot to put a little more 'drama' into end plot.",1407628800,2,1372,4.791489361702127
