4667483,5,B005EUXN6E,Chosin is an excellent documentary that provides insight into the Korean War from the perspective of the brave men who were at the Chosin Reservoir. It is difficult to imagine the conditions under which this war was fought. The documentary captures the essence of the experience without being overly graphic. The Korean war is barely mentioned in most history courses. I highly recommend this documentary for teenagers and adults.,1314403200,42,430,5.246376811594203
4667484,5,B005EUXN6E,"Great Documentary about a war that I knew too little about. Not a lot of graphic violence, (which I prefer), but the storytelling and the interviews with the survivors tell the story movingly. I highly recommend it.",1314403200,3,215,4.837837837837838
4667485,5,B005EUXN6E,"Superb account of one of the greatest feats in all of military history.  Only U.S. Marines could have done something as impossible as what the First Marine Division did in the bitter cold of that Korean winter.  The Marines not only endured, they inflicted massive casualties on the Chinese who engulfed them and outnumbered them by a huge factor. They fought their way about eighty miles, cut off and totally surrounded, to the sea. They were written off as ""lost"" by the Pentagon, and the Chinese were celebrating the defeat of U.S. Marines for the first time in history, but the Chinese trap exploded in their face.  Marines don't surrender, and for the men caught in the trap, they came out fighting, they came out like Marines, bringing their dead, wounded, and equipment with them.
The Marines who are interviewed are truly heroes . Their ordeal by fire and ice stands as a singular event in the history of men at war. The film ""Chosin"" does a great job of getting a deeply personal look at what these heroes experienced.  I highly recommend this documentary.",1495324800,,1065,4.7405405405405405
4667486,3,B005EUXN6E,"Imagine that you were able to interview a number of the survivors of Custers battle at the Little Big Horn.  Imagine further that some film had been taken of the battle and you were able to get your hands on it.  Imagine, as well, that a very realistic Hollywood movie had been made about the battle and you were able to get some choice footage from it.  Then you locate a fine composer who can establish just the right mood, as you weave it all together into a documentary movie.

That comes close to what Brian Iglesias and Anton Sattler have accomplished with Chosin, a film about General Douglas MacArthurs much bigger and more recent debacle.  It is known as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, and it took place in the far reaches of northern Korea in the early winter of 1950, only five months after the Korean War began.  As a truly horrible experience, though, Chosin Reservoir was Little Bighorn on steroids.  It was anything but a short, sharp decisive battle.  It lasted for 17 days, sometimes in driving snow and always in bitter, sub-zero temperatures.  The American soldiers were surrounded and vastly outnumbered by several divisions of Chinese soldiers, and, in spite of strong evidence of what was about to happen, their leaders had been taken completely by surprise.  Listening to the compelling stories that the interviewers were able to elicit from a truly extraordinary collection of veterans, one is, by turns, heartbroken and inspired.  Particularly inspiring, as well, was the actual footage of the rescue of some 98,000 civilian refugeesmany of them Christianswho faced almost certain slaughter at the hands of the Communists who suspected them of collaboration.

I attended a premier showing of Chosin at the U.S. Navy Memorial in Washington, DC.  There was a panel discussion afterward with the two film makers, both of whom are U.S. Marine reserve officers and combat veterans of the first Gulf War and of Iraq, and two Chosin Reservoir battle survivors.  All agreed that the fact that the filmmaker/interviewers were themselves combat veterans explained, to a large degree, how they were able to draw out the stories of the battle survivors so well.

They are probably right.  But what might have been a crucial factor in making this movie an artistic triumph makes it, to my mind, somewhat dubious politically.  Little Bighorn is now universally recognized as a military disaster born of extreme hubris, the folly of one inadequate leader, General George Armstrong Custer.  Chosin Reservoir was General MacArthurs Little Bighorn, except that it was far, far worse in almost every way imaginable.  By the usual military measure, it was a crushing defeat.  From positions that they occupied deep in the country, the United States Army and Marines were driven out of North Korea, never to return.  The makers of Chosin commendably avoid politics or appearing to espouse any particular point of view, for the most part.  But war is by its very nature political; it is not just another tragedy or act of nature.  Politics is unavoidable in a war story.  In avoiding politics, the filmmakers end up depicting Chosin Reservoir as a battle for survival.  If the Americans escape their encirclement and make it back to the port and onto the waiting ships, they win.  They do and they do, at least all the ones we see on the screen.  We never have to worry if those individuals that the viewers get attached to are going to make it, because there they are, alive, telling their stories.  To be sure, we get to hear them tell about the gruesome deaths of some of their closest buddies, but those are not people that the viewers have come to care about.

In this regard, fiction is a superior medium for imparting the greater truth.  In the splendid Korean War movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tae-Guk-Gi-The-Brotherhood-Of-War/dp/B003EAYMZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood Of War</a>, for instance, the viewers grow strongly attached to one of the characters who does what she has to do to survive during the Communist occupation of Seoul, but then, because of that, she is shot as a collaborator by the South Koreans when they retake the city.  The full senseless horror of this war and war in general is thus better revealed.

The Dead Have No Voice

The documentary makers are hamstrung, to a degree, by their method.  It is one that they share with all compilers of history who depend upon the accounts of the survivors.  They cant interview the dead.  But they might have escaped the charge that they are unduly glorifying a costly defeat, and glorifying war in general, if they had interviewed, say, some of the widows or other loved ones of those who were killed.  My late mother, who never quite got over the loss of her drafted younger brother in that war, would have made a good interview subject.  Also, I should think that there would have been plenty of expressions of understandable bitterness toward their leaders by many, if not most, of the interviewees.  Virtually all we get to see are the brief complaints that captured Chinese soldiers are being ignored as evidence that the Chinese might have come into the war in force. (One of the survivor panelists called it the biggest failure of military intelligence in our history and said that he learned upon meeting with a Chinese veteran of the battle that the Chinese had been deployed to Korea for a full month before the actual mass attack.)

Perhaps it was because I saw the screening in a very military setting, and perhaps it was because the young film makers, like so many of their cohorts, flaunted their Marine background so strongly, but the movie, even with all the horror it depicted, to me came across as a bit too pro-war.  I can imagine General Buck Turgidson of Dr. Strangelove fame being pleased with it as an illustration of the American military can-do spirit instead of the needless blood-let that it was, resulting from political and military bungling.

With all the talk these days about anyone in uniform as a hero, selflessly serving the cause of freedom, one could easily lose sight of the fact that many of those who paid the ultimate price at Chosin Reservoir and in the Korean War were draftees, or joined to get a better deal than they would get when they were inevitably drafted.  Theres a certain irony in seeming to depict that as a glorious sacrifice for the cause of freedom.

All in all, this is a very powerful and important movie that repeatedly brought tears to my eyes. I fear, though, that it will be misused and the wrong message will be sent.",1491955200,,6639,4.884032114183764

4667490,5,B005EUXN6E,"I generally do not comment on videos but I feel like I have to for this one. This one is well done and to the point. That being said, there were other branches of the military involved at Chosin and they too lost their lives fighting there. In December of 1950, my uncle Celestino Chavez Jr. was part of Battery D, 15th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, 7th Infantry Division in the US Army. He was listed as Missing in Action while fighting the enemy near the Chosin Reservoir, North Korea on December 2, 1950. He was presumed dead on December 31, 1953.

The Silver Star was awarded to Corporal Chavez Posthumously on June 4th, 1951. The action which won Corporal Chavez this honor is cited as follows:

Corporal Celestino Chaves RA 18 255 711, Artillery, United Stated Army, while a member of Battery D, 15th Anti-aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion (Self-Propelled), displayed gallantry in action against an armed enemy near the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, on 30 November 1950.

On this date, his M-19 twin 40mm gun carriage was defending a portion of a perimeter when the enemy began a ""banzai"" charge against the position shortly before 0300 hours. Corporal Chavez was struck and seriously wounded during this attack but he refused to be evacuated to the aid station because there was no other man available to replace him. He stayed at his post voluntarily and despite his wound kept the weapon firing.

When the enemy attack had been broken up by accurate and intense fire of the M-19, Corporal Chavez, weakened by loss of blood, collapsed unconscious and fell from the M-19 to the ground.

The Battle of Chosin Reservoir, also known as the Chosin Reservoir Campaign was a decisive battle in the Korean War. On 27 November, the Chinese Army surprised UN Forces at the Chosin Reservoir area. A brutal 17-day battle in freezing weather and rough terrain soon followed. In the period between 27 November and 13 December 1950, 30,000 United Nations troops were encircled and attacked by many Chinese troops.

The cold weather was accompanied by frozen ground, resulting in frostbite casualties, icy roads, and weapon malfunctions. In the end over 17,000 UN forces were killed or wounded or missing in action, or died of wounds. To this day Celestino ChavezJr. remains Missing in Action.",1489881600,,2318,4.930769230769231

4667494,5,B005EUXN6E,"My dad served with the First Marine Regiment, I was a preschooler when he came home.  This is the only film about that battle that agrees with all the things he said about that place.  It was hard to see the fights and bitter cold he talked about.  They interviewed men who served with the Fifth and Seventh Regiments, they couldn't find any still alive from the First Regiment, there weren't enough of them, only 648 of about 5000.  The other two regiments were only a little bit better off.  This film shows some live battle footage I've never seen before, dead Chinese everywhere.  It shows just how cold cold can be.  Now I know where my dads swagger came from.  At the end of this film the men recounted how many men were still alive in their units after each fight, my dad had said the same kind of things except the smallest numbers were 9, 7, and 3. The Marines saved about 90,000 refugees.  This film shows the grave yard the Korean refugees made by going back and finding the remains of the men who saved their lives.  It's huge, beautiful, and heart breaking.

Normally I don't write reviews but this film stands head and shoulders above the rest, especially the PBS American Experience one by Randall Maclowry.  They didn't do their homework, and they certainly didn't find men with swagger. All the men they interviewed showed no signs of frostbite, they still had all their fingers, and looked like they wondered if they had said things right.  Their numbers don't add up.  This film reports that each regiment of 5000 were attacked by 40000 Chinese soldiers.  My dad said there were between 30000 and 40000 that his regiment fought and the other 2 regiments were hit every bit as hard.

There is no glory in war, but there is valor.  This film isn't for the weak, it will shake you up, and show you what Marines are made of.",1486684800,9,1839,4.490963855421687

Smith became the epitome of an excellent and empathetic commander in my estimation as a result of his leadership.  In addition ""East of Chosin"" by Ray Appleman gives a very detailed account of the problems encountered by Smith's command.  As a result of Smith's decision to do ""what was needed"" to fight and survive, he had to buck the Tokyo command of Gen. MacArthur and his naive and flunky subordinates.  This resulted in Smith never obtaining the just recognition he should have received.

4667547,5,B005EUXN6E,"This is an awesome account of the Battle of Chosin, the battle in which some 12,000 US troops came up against 120,000 Chinese Communist soldiers.  Completely surrounded, the US troops had to fend off nightmarish attacks from all sides as they fought their way south towards the coast, all the time suffering from the bitter cold and lack of artillery or other external support.  3,000 died; 9,000 were left with permanent physical injuries or amputations from frost bite.  I won't spoil the end for you but I heartily recommend this movie for anyone who would like to get started learning about the Korean War.

As a military veteran myself, I was greatly moved by the movie 'We Were Soldiers Once and Young"" and went on to read both Col. Hal Moore's book and Joe Galloway's book on the Battle of La Drang Valley during the Vietnam war.  This movie ""Chosin"" has done the same and I now see that learning more about the Korean War is important if I am going to understand the present cold war between North and South Korea.

These two military men who gathered Korean War veterans and allowed them to tell their stories did a great service to the men who fought the war and to those of us who actually did not understand how bad it was. I've watched tv programs that presented facts about the war, but nothing brought the horror of what happened at the reservoir to me - the viewer -like listening to these men as they recounted what they went through. I know this was the most accurate account available because my husband agreed with everything these veterans said. He was sent to Korea in 1950 as a 17-year-old Marine and was part of the 1st Marine Division's march back from the Chosin Reservoir. He survived, but now I realize how many did not; the percentage is astounding. Thank you to the producers of this film for helping the rest of us understand.",1420934400,2,970,4.548571428571429

I have always been fascinated by the Chosin Campaign and have studied it since I went to Parris Island in 1994. As a writer myself, I was hoping great things for this documentary, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. I felt that the Director was all over the place, you did not know if they were talking about East Hill?, Task Force Drysdale? Fox Hill? Yudam-ni? ....etc.. The Chosin Few veterans that were interviewed had no names or what Company/Regiment they were with at Chosin. As a former Marine, I feel that Brian could have done a much better job of truly bringing to life the incredible story and bravery of the Chosin Few. I am glad that I was able to add this film to my long list of WW1/WW2/Korea and Vietnam documentaries and I am also glad that some proceeds go to the Wounded Warrior Project. Regardless of the set backs with Chosin, it still is a must see for those that are curious about the Campaign.

But none of that is really important - what is important is what happened to those Marines and Soldiers.
Seldom do we get the people who were there to tell their story and I can see why.  Living through an event like
that is something you only want to do once - you don't need to relive it trying to explain what happened to people who
will never understand.

Recently my father-in-law passed away, he was 94 and he had been at Chosin with the 1st Marines.  He never spoke
about being there.  I found out by accident.  Now I have just a small idea of why he didn't talk about his experiences
in the service.

I need to say thank you to the producers of this film.  I need to say thank you to the men who finally told their stories.

4667586,5,B005EUXN6E,"As an amateur historian who has followed various wars and the history and stories behind those wars I can only say, ""From where do such as these men come?""

First hand accounts of hell. Marines and Soldiers fighting for another moment of life in conditions that would make others turn to mush and dig their own grave! References, pictures, background and video of what has to have been one of the most terrifying yet defining moment in the lives of the warriors who fought these multiple battles and became the Chosin 'Few'.

If you stand in awe of such bravery and courage while knowing full well you will probably die, and, as I, simply thank God for this kind of resoluteness and steadfastness under fire, than this movie will be well worth your time. There are not enough accolades to describe such behavior. Outnumbered from day one and often 20 to 1, using the enemy bodies (and sometimes those of your own dead buddies) to build a 'hole' (because the ground could not be dug) to fight from, seeing companies reduced to 15 or 20 functional, carrying the frozen bodies of people who ate a cold dinner with you to the morgue in the morning... and going back up to fight again. I do not know if we, in America, now have the ""stuff"" that made up these immortal souls (and I know we've had the same kind of ""do or die"" in Vietnam, the Middle East, Mosul, Fallujah and Nasiriyah, and in the small but heroic battles throughout that region, no disrespect, but we are looking at unprepared,  less trained, 'civilian' warriors at Chosin)

Watch this with your grandchildren or children. Unbelievable story of heroism, courage under conditions that turn most to water, and ""no greater love..."".

Let this documentary of the struggles and bravery of these marines help us to be thankful and to count our blessings everyday! May those who died not be forgotten and let those that survived know that they didn't fight The Forgotten War, but saved thousands of people that lived in South Korea from having to be forced to live under communism. This documentary has truly made me proud to say that I get to live in the land where these marines fought for the rights that we have today! Thank you MARINES!!!!!""

""I learned from the veterans that freedom has a price. It gives me a great deal of respect for them because they were willing to pay that price with their lives if necessary. The spirit and dedication of the marine corps is truly amazing-it is no wonder they are the best fighting forces in the world.""

""The men that we were privileged to hear about in the video about the Chosin Reservoir especially deserve to be remembered for their dutiful but heroic service to our country. Just as their duty was to fight for their nation, our duty now is to remember and honor them for what they have been through.""

Jesus said, Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends, and we should treat our veterans accordingly.

""I never realized the horror of what went on at the Chosin. I guess this really made me sober and think about this in a way i haven't before. I gave me a true respected for our troops and veterans. You don't really realize what people go through while you are in your own little ""protected"" world. What impacted me the most i would say is how these men had witnessed their buddies brutally murdered, or even a man you don't know personally. It must have been such a traumatic and dramatic experience for these brave and courageous men.""

The names are listed at the end but that makes it very hard to put a face to the name.

4667624,4,B005EUXN6E,"This film consists of several veterans of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir telling their stories.  The documentary isn't about the maneuvers of divisions and regiments, the logistics, or the strategy of generals.  It tells just enough of that to give context to the individual reminisces, and isn't particularly accurate or complete.  That's not the point.  The documentary is about the experiences of some of the men who were there, fighting a confused battle with enemy in all directions, often fighting in dark of night, standing in boots or socks on frozen ground or dragging themselves across the ice, at 40 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit.  They are intimate stories of horrific suffering, lost comrades, and the will to survive.  Most of the veterans in the film are former Marines and proud of it, as they should be.  Two are former Army Soldiers, members of the 31st RCT that held off the main Chinese attack for four days and left so few survivors to tell the tale that it took historians fifty years to piece it together.  All these two Soldiers saw was their little piece of the fight, in which they were wounded and separated from comrades and against all odds made it out alive.  The Marines tell of fighting off Chinese human wave attacks, of comrades dying in their arms, of trying to stack frozen corpses, of fighting and marching and enduring bitter cold.  It isn't grand history, but it is intimate, horrifying, moving, and more authentic than war portrayed as symbols and arrows on a map.

4667637,5,B005EUXN6E,Full disclosure: Brian Iglesias is my former platoon commander.  Chosin is a powerful film that portrays the horrors and triumphs of the Marines and soldiers in the Chosin Reservoir.  Chosin won't give you much insight into the technical and tactical aspects of the battle but it will give you a feel for the human factors that affected those fighting.  The stories told in the film are both heartbreaking and inspirational.  The power of this film is that it proves that even when vastly outnumbered and at a great military disadvantage well led men can work together to thrive and overcome extreme hardship.  I highly recommend this film and plan to show it to and discuss it with my Marines.,1361664000,,694,4.798319327731092

As much time as I have spent reading history, I have read precious little on the Korean War, and what little I read only mentioned Chosin as part of a larger discussion of the Pusan perimeter.

The audacity of the Marines and US Army troops not just to stand and fight, but to accept the orders to basically attack the enemy when obviously the Chinese commanders expected the US soldiers to just sit in place is a terrific story. Thank goodness it has been told. I also had no idea that the US commanders on the scene made the choice to rescue almost 100,000 North Korean civilians from systematic murder by the invading Chinese army.

This is a battle as desperate as Stalingrad, but which somehow was skipped in most popular histories. As some of the witnesses interviewed in the documentary said, Korea was not just a forgotten war, but also a forgotten victory.",1358294400,2,952,4.56140350877193

Both veterans and non-veterans will also find this film informative. It is a frank exposure to the sacrifices, discipline, and courage that is so typical of America's fighting men and women. It aptly demonstrates how U.S. fighting men and women,when called upon to do so, step up and answer the call and sacrifice so much to serve in a cause greater than self,in the case for the fledgling country of South Korea.

This documentary is a remarkable attempt to help make that right and present this piece of forgotten or ignored history.  Within the Korean War, Chosin was one of the most brutal series of battles, mostly fought by one Marine Regiment.  This documentary interviews a number of veterans of Chosin who describe the battle against the Chinese enemy and the bitter cold.  It will fill you with emotion and pride in our country and its veterans.  The Korean War was a conflict intended to stop the spread of communism and to free the people of Korea.  Looking back today, it accomplished both.  The American and Allied contribution to the people of Korea to keep them free is a remarkable piece of history and demonstrates the goodness of this country.

4667651,5,B005EUXN6E,"My parents remember the Korean War vividly. They were young and had just survived Japanese occupation. Brother fought against brother, and families were torn apart. But to this day, my parents will always be grateful to the Americans who came and saved their world, allowed them to pursue their futures and know a life free from oppression-something some of their friends would never experience. It was a war that receives little recognition here, but in the minds of people like my parents, the sacrifice of American soldiers will never be forgotten. Watching a documentary like this one- to see the faces and hear the words of these men- makes me realize that many of us have forgotten the price that many have paid for peace. The documentary's strength lies not in graphic images of death or fighting, but in listening to the memories of these men who endured horrific conditions and frequently overwhelming odds .  Most  of the film is made up of interviews of these veterans, who bear both physical and emotional scars that are still painful after all this time. Their accounts reveal portraits of bravery and kindness interspersed with suffering of both soldiers and civilians. Yes, this is perhaps a very simplified portrayal - no mention is made of the darker side of soldiers and their actions- but that was not the point of this documentary. We need to learn about those early days of the Cold War and remember those men that allowed people like my parents to live in a world of freedom and democracy. The Korean War remains a chapter in American history that receives little attention, and I hope that documentaries like this one will change that.",1331078400,46,1658,4.834507042253521

It is an amazing first-hand accounting of one of the epic battles of The Forgotten War when 15,000 American Marines, Soldiers, and Sailors had to fight their way through 100,000+ Chinese Communists.  It combines intensely personal memories of close quarter combat with the memories of those who had a more strategic view of the battle.  It's gut-wrenching narrative with all the horror and sadness of war but ultimately uplifting with their courage, grace, and humor.  I guess the only beef I had with this documentary was they don't identify the men but ultimately, it isn't necessary because they represent all those who fight for us.
