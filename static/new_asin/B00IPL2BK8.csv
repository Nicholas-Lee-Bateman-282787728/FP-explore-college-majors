6284919,5,B00IPL2BK8,"The movie is ok, not great, definitely far from terrible.  I give it 5 stars specifically because of the Adele parody which begins at 59:45.  (""Someone An Awful Lot Like You"").  I was literally in tears from laughing so hard.  I watched Lady Peacock's brilliant 3 1/2 minute ""performance"" of this masterpiece over and over again.  (I guess I have to admit that the song itself is kind of catchy, but Lady Peacock's totally over-the-top stage antics are what make this such a great scene.)  The girl who actually sings the song is apparently named Elissa Goldstein and her voice is amazing.  And the world would be a much better place if every person who was about to listen to ""Someone Like You"" by Adele, would play ""Someone An Awful Lot Like You"" instead!!!",1408924800,,759,4.619402985074627

6284924,5,B00IPL2BK8,"DVD Review - Lady Peacock

KC Comeaux (left) and
Alec W. Seymour in ""Lady Peacock""
When gay men dress up as women in colorful makeup and costumes in order to impress potential mates, it's called being a peacock. Yes, a lady peacock is just another term for a drag queen, but, aside from one person in this movie, the two main characters aren't drag queens.

What they are are totally hot for each other, but there is an acute triangle at work here. The story is simple. Two guys fight over a third, forcing the third to choose which one to whom he'll ultimately give his virginity.

That third guy is named Devin, and he's played by the very cute KC Comeaux. Devin is the object of desire between two boys but is also a lot more than that. He's comparable to Andrew Keegan's character in The Broken Hearts Club (2000).

It's no question that Devin is gay but he seems not to hit the obvious gay clich&eacute;s or stereotypes. In the gay club, Devin is very straight-acting. The aspiring architect wears a baseball cap. He doesn't talk or carry himself with the same air as the other more effeminate men, not that that's a bad thing.

On one side of him is Conner, a former nerd who's savvy in the gay scene but who has a bit of a confidence problem. On the other side is Edwin, a Latino who isn't shy about anything and certainly goes after what he wants. Conner isn't shy either. He voices his opinion but is sometimes hesitant. Edwin is just a lot stronger. Some might call him bitchy.

Alec W. Seymour plays Conner who first eyes Devin in the club. The two connect but don't have sex. They have a bit of respect for each other. Joshua Cruz plays Edwin who eyes Devin the next night and doesn't share Conner's restraint. He just wants to get Devin in the sack.

Who wouldn't? But, that's when the fight for Devin begins. The gay bar called Club Calais, somewhere in New York, hosts drag queen competitions. Edwin and Conner use that competition as a way to settle the rivalry over who will have Devin's chastity. A turn of events takes the competition off the stage and into the streets or at least the parking lot in front of the club. Yes, things get violent.

Yet, the performances of the peacocks are full songs with director Jana (AJ) Mattioli not doing a lot of coverage for them. Mattoli just keeps the camera straight on. It allows you to fully appreciate the performances as they're happening.

The songs for the most part are lip-sync. I don't think it's out of a lack of ability for the boys to sing. As KC Comeaux proved with a brilliant YouTube video, he can definitely sing. Check it out here. Lip-sync just comes from a long tradition in the drag world.

The B-story involves Conner's friend Mathew, played by Simon Vargas. Mathew is in an acute triangle too with an older white guy who's in a 15-year relationship with a cupcake maker. It sounds pretty funny, but there is a strange sweetness to it that goes to age disparity in dating with a genuineness and a gentleness that you don't often get in films.

Three Stars out of Five.
Not Rated but recommended for mature audiences.
Running Time: 1 hr. and 39 mins.

6284925,1,B00IPL2BK8,"The Worst Gay movie ever! Worst script. Worst directing. Worst editing. Worst acting. Worst drag. Worst lip syncing. Seriously, I never write reviews, I have better things to do, but this was a terrible waste of time, I've watched a lot a gay films in my life, and I honestly could not have been more disappointed.

6284933,5,B00IPL2BK8,"AMAZING! One of my favorite buys so far on Amazon. I was very pleased with the soundtrack, one of a kind. The script had genuine radiance to it but I agree with my peers that it could have been better. Overall, this is definitely a buy. I am big fan of Bones and Eric Millegan was a bonus! I am big critic of LGBT indie films but this one really stole my heart. I am glad Lady Peacock came along my way. Worth it.",1451692800,,413,3.9285714285714284
6284934,1,B00IPL2BK8,"Not just ridiculously trite and stereotypical, but completely unrealistic settings and characters.  Barely a single ""true"" moment in this.  The script and dialogue were awful.  The acting was poor.  And the editing kept any of the jokes from landing.  Just incredibly awkward throughout.

The exception was KC Comeaux - who did the best he could (and was probably the truest character in the whole film) with the terribly-written script he was given.  (I had to check why he looked familiar, and it turns out I saw KC in a production of ""bare"" in Kansas City and he was wonderful in it, so this performance is no surprise.)  He's what kept this review from getting zero stars.",1450742400,,676,4.767241379310345

6284942,5,B00IPL2BK8,Great!!!,1428105600,,8,8.0
6284943,4,B00IPL2BK8,"""Lady Peacock is the newest feature film by groundbreaking director AJ Mattioli (An Affirmative Act) . Delving into a romantic comedy (a new genre for Mattioli), Lady Peacock can best be described as an innocently light sex romp of first love! The story centers on the premise of ""boy meets boy"" - and all the chaos and comedy that ensues while ""boy pursues boy""!  With the use of split-screen set ups and visible message bubbles in this hilarious LGBTQ flick, is clear that Director AJ Mattioli has been inspired by and sweetly pays homage to the classic bedroom comedies of the 60's.

The talented cast of mostly new-comers is refreshing and their names and faces are definitely worth remembering, we will likely see more of this group of actors as they go on to future roles and notoriety. Our stars Alec Seymour and KC Comeaux are wonderfully believable as our destined young lovers. Josh Cruz is simply sublime as our bitchy, drag queen villain.

Lady Peacock is chock-full of cute boys, sexy girls, drag queens, comical set ups, one-liners, and dance music to get your dance juices pumping!  From beginning to end, Lady Peacock is going to be a ride that's full of flirty, fun entertainment!""",1413936000,3,1198,4.800970873786408
