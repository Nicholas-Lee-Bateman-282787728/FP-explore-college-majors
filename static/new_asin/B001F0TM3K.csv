3558965,2,B001F0TM3K,"First off, I love the movie ""Supercop."" I saw it back in 1994 at an independent movie theater. I didn't even know who Jackie Chan was. The movie was hilarious and action packed, and I became an instant Jackie Chan fan.
However this Dimension Blu-Ray is sadly lacking. First, it has no Chinese audio track. It only has an English dub. I always like to enjoy movies in their original language, but what makes it worse is that I'm a bit hard of hearing, so I miss quite a few words of this mediocre English dub.
Second, it has no subtitles. I would have at least liked subtitles to help me understand the audio track. (One of the reasons I buy movies on Blu-Ray is to have subtitles because of my less-than-good hearing.)
If you just want the movie for the action and nothing more, then this is a good version. But if you enjoy movies in their original language with subtitles, then skip this one.",1478131200,,894,4.391566265060241

3558985,5,B001F0TM3K,"Disclaimer: This review I'm about to do is for the original Cantonese version of ""Police Story 3: SuperCop"" uncut, which can be found in the Hong Kong or Japanese releases. If you're reading this from the Dimension listing, I'm referring to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-Blu-ray/dp/B0046W6UYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3 [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Story-3-Super-Cop-Blu-ray/dp/B0031P6X7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Story 3: Super Cop [Blu-ray</a>] just to avoid confusion.

Having to import this movie instead of the Dimension version was something. That's because I love watching Jackie Chan movies and always wanting to see the uncut version is an incredible experience.
The Japanese release has both the Cantonese version and the Japanese dub with Japanese subtitles.
In Police Story 3: Supercop, this movie begins with a police briefing and then we get to the motorcycle scene (where the US version begins). In the Cantonese version there's a little bit of English dialogue in select scenes, plus the original music score and Jackie Chan's closing theme (with the outtake scenes) is way better than the Dimension version.

I think someone at the time has been playing Tetris on Sega Mega Drive on the set of this movie.",1447632000,,1350,6.291891891891892

3559049,3,B001F0TM3K,"Supercop is basically the third entry in Jackie Chan's Police Story series. Many of the characters in the first two Police Story movies are featured in Supercop, although the film feels much more Americanized than the prior films. The quote on the cover says that this movie is ""non-stop action"", I'll save you the suspense by letting you know that the action does indeed stop.

There aren't quite as many stunts in this film as there was in the first two and the fight scenes are more few and far between as well. What we did get to see in this one that we didn't get in the first two however, is a pretty good shootout scene that actually showed Chan firing a gun and taking out a few baddies (which hadn't happened before in the series).

Another change was the addition of Michelle Yeoh to help distribute more of the fight scenes among her and Chan. The final scene incorporates pretty unbelievable stunts including a NO CG scene of Jackie hanging from a ladder of a helicopter.",1399507200,,983,4.51685393258427

The English version butchered a movie with great performances from both Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh (this girl knows how to kick) with an awful choice of music that totally puts the viewer out of the experience.

3559079,4,B001F0TM3K,"Following Jackie Chan's major American breakthrough, Rumble in the Bronx, American distributors started sniffing around for other Jackie Chan films they might dub and dump onto the American market.  It is no surprise that one of Chan's first Hong Kong films chosen for an American audience came from his most successful series, the Police Story movies.  All they had to do was drop ""Police Story"" from the title and take it to a chop shop where parts of the movie could be taken out, seemingly at random.  While I have seen the original cuts of both Police Story 1 and 2, this review is of the American cut of Supercop.  Although I generally prefer to watch the original version of a foreign film, I do believe there's some value in seeing what parts of a movie are deemed necessary for American viewers.  Besides, getting an original cut of this film is notoriously difficult.

 Relaying the plot of the American cut turns out to be somewhat difficult, but I will give it a try nonetheless.  Chan is brought in on a joint international assignment between Hong Kong and mainland China.  His goal is to go undercover in order to infiltrate an organized crime syndicate.  Chan's Chinese partner, Inspector Jessica Lang, is played by none other than female martial arts legend Michelle Yeoh who ably matches Jackie Chan move for move.  In order to go under cover, Chan helps the imprisoned brother of an organized crime leader escape and later ingratiates himself into his association.  Chan befriends his mark by hiding him in his hometown where Inspector Lang pretends to be Chan's sister.  The end goal is to follow the brother all the way up the totem pole to his drug lord brother and finally to the coalition of weapons and drugs dealers that he belongs to.

At least, I'm relatively certain this is the plot of the film.  It's a little foggy until about half way through the film.  One of several scenes that the American distributors deemed unnecessary was an explanation of Chan and Lang's mission and why it was first necessary to break the brother out of prison in order to infiltrate the syndicate.  It is only when the criminal syndicate is introduced that a viewer can reasonably piece together the point of all this subterfuge.  Perhaps the American distributor thought that audiences don't go to see a Jackie Chan film for the plot, and while this might be nominally true, it would be nice to know exactly what MacGuffin Chan is after.

According to the great sage Wikipedia, scenes illustrating cultural differences between Hong Kong and China were also excised, perhaps because the distributor assumed that culture clashes from half a world away mean nothing to an American audience.  This, of course, is not the case.  If an American audience is coming to a foreign film, whether it's a French new wave or Chinese martial arts film, then they are likely interested in taking in a quick glance of another culture.  Likewise, the film's American soundtrack is littered with bargain bin hip hop and second hand covers that do the movie no favors.

Police Story 3: Supercop finds the series pivoting from gritty urban action to James Bond intrigue.  This shift in genre is spelled out for us in the opening minutes of the film when Chan's boss, Uncle Bill, suggests that Interpol needs James Bond for their newest assignment.  The first two Police Story movies were somewhat confused in tone, attempting to be both a goofy comedy and a Dirty Harry type rogue cop film.  At times I did miss the way that the earlier films made use of enclosed urban spaces, but it is competently replaced by international vistas, shoot outs and car chases.  The new genre and setting changes the action as well, which focuses less on hand to hand martial arts than it does on tremendous stunts involving as many vehicles as they could fit into the movie.

Supercop's greatest contribution to the series may have be the introduction of Michelle Yeoh who provides the first instance of a strong capable female in the entire franchise.  In the tradition of the buddy cop film (from which this movie is also borrowing), Yeoh's character, Lang, performs the role of the buttoned up, by the book professional who clashes with the freewheeling, undisciplined Chan.  By including a second hero who can also use her hand and feet as weapons, the movie not only adds something new to a Police Story movie, but it also allows for several interesting action sequences, including one where Chan must help Lang, who has been strapped with an explosive vest, avoid being shot lest both of heroes, as well as anyone else in the general vicinity.

Of course, Chan's girlfriend, May, does show up in the film, albeit in a much smaller capacity than in the other films.  Poor, poor May.  Not only is she nearly forgotten for most of the film's running time, only to show up at the end to fulfill the role of a hostage, but she is also pushed into a pool, mistaken for a prostitute and shoved out of a helicopter.  In many ways Supercop's shift in genre means, except for some familiar faces, it could have easily stood on its own (perhaps one of the reasons why it was released in the U.S.).  And yet I can't help but admire the decision to mess with the formula, to keep the series fresh.",1310860800,,5264,4.703380588876772

3559082,5,B001F0TM3K,"I think, like many Westerners, my first introduction to Jackie Chan was ""Rumble In The Bronx"". I was impressed enough to start backtracking through his film history where the REAL Jackie Chan treasures lie: his early comedy brotherhood with Hung and Liu, action-adventures like ""Armor Of God"", and spy-actioners like ""Who Am I?"". Through all of them, the unique mental gymnastics that drives his physical gymnastics could be seen developing along very similar lines to Charlie Chaplin, ever-more refined. But one aspect of his films remained the same: his awkwardness with women, whether they were antagonists or love interests or colleagues. In Michelle Yeoh (Khan), and in ""Supercop"", he takes full advantage of the awkwardness for the first time, dealing with a character who is at first his superior and becomes his partner, an equal in every way. Her sense of timing, movement, and even comedy mirrors his. In that sense, ""Supercop"" rose to new levels-- and budget-- to become one of Chan's finest films.",1310515200,,1009,5.121212121212121
3559083,5,B001F0TM3K,"In Police Story 3: Supercop(1992), Officer Kevin Chan Ka Kui(Jackie Chan) is sent to Mainland China to infiltrate a gang of drug dealers. Michelle Yeoh plays Chan's sidekick, Officer Yang. Chan has a habit of casting pretty girls who can't act. Michelle Yeoh is not only a good actress, but she matches Chan in the stunts and fight scenes. The producers of the James Bond movies saw Supercop and they cast Yeoh as a Chinese spy in Tomorrow Never Dies(1997). In Supercop, Chan doesn't slack off. There's a scene where he hangs from a helicopter as it flies over Malaysia. There's no visual effects or camera tricks! The Hong Kong version of Supercop is longer. It has a scene where a girl dies from a drug overdose and a scene where Officer Yang teaches Chan Ka Kui Cantonese slang words. Maggie Cheung returns as Chan's girlfriend May, but she isn't given much screen time. In the Hong Kong version, we can hear Cheung speak perfect English. Cheung played ""herself"" in the French art house movie Irma Vep(1996). There was a semi sequel to Supercop called Project S(1993) with Officer Yang chasing a gang of thieves. Jackie Chan made a cameo in the film in bad drag. Chan hired Stanley Tong to direct the film so he could focus on acting and the action scenes. There's a neat action scene where the villain's gunmen attack a general's camp. You can see explosions and stuntmen hurled into the air! There's only enough plot and character depth to hold the action scenes together, but the action scenes are excellent!

3559099,3,B001F0TM3K,"POLICE STORY 3: SUPERCOP features the dream team of Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh, the only instance in which these two Hong Kong icons really teamed up (no, commercials and cameos don't count). The plot involves the Royal Hong Kong Police's top cop Ka-Kui Chan (Jackie) and Interpol's frosty Inspector Yang (Yeoh) infiltrating a crime lord's inner circle while pretending to be brother and sister. Expect some dynamite kung-fu stuff and also the two stars' performing their own stunts. Cue Jackie's patented humor, and maybe the funniest bit has Ka-Kui - in unfamiliar territory and accompanied by the bad guys - scrambling to adapt to the fake family the police had come up for him at the last minute. And what's a POLICE STORY without cute Maggie Cheung (who plays Jackie's girlfriend) inadvertently throwing a wrench into the works? Jackie and Michelle are awesome together.

I kinda figured this wasn't the uncut version when the real opening sequence didn't surface (the one with the big law enforcement conference in which the consensus was that it required a ""supercop"" to take on the vast drug dealing problem. I don't quite know why Dragon Dynasty went with this inferior version, when they went with the uncut editions for the first two POLICE STORY films. I blame broccoli.

I don't know that Michelle ends up hijacking Jackie's film, but she most definitely holds up her end, and this after around a four year hiatus from cinema. She refers to herself as a ""tough cookie"" in her interview in the bonus features, and I think she undersells herself. There's a gratifying element in that her Inspector Yang goes from being this stern, self-controlled figure into a more playful character as she masquerades as Jackie's character's sister. Juxtaposing her smooth, flowing fighting style is Ka-Kui Chan's more unorthodox street fighting moves, but both methods work and I just bet both styles are equally felt by Jackie's stunt group in lumps and bruises.

Maybe it's the purist in me but I wasn't entirely down with the Rambo sequence as Jackie and Michelle engage in a massive shootout in a renegade general's camp. I know that Michelle Yeoh, early in her career, played a bunch of gun-toting police officer roles, and Jackie's done similar roles, as well. But I say let Americans and John Woo characters do the gun thing. I'd rather watch Jackie wresting a gun away from a bad guy and then field stripping it in moments... Sorry, I can't help but feel that guns are beneath these two icons, and especially Jackie Chan.

This Dragon Dynasty release comes with two DVDs. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and an audio commentary by Hong Kong cinema know-it-all Logan Bey (but his stuff's always worth listening to). Disc 2 has these 4 interviews: Jackie Chan reflects on POLICE STORY 3, on Michelle Yeoh, on working with other directors, what it was like dangling dizzyingly off that helicopter, and his befuddlement over his pictures getting the serious edit treatment for overseas release (00;19:21 minutes); Michelle Yeoh talks about her time in the movie, on doing her own stunts, and how she wanted to do the helicopter stunt herself until the director asked her - and I'm paraphrasing - ""Michelle, if you do that, what in the world is Jackie going to do to be able to top that stunt?"" so she settled for the motorbike stunt (but, first, she had to learn how to ride a motorbike; 00:23:11); an interview with director Stanley Tong (00:19:32); and an interview with Jackie Chan bodyguard/training partner/co-star Ken Lo (with English sub-titles, 00:21:44).

As per norm, stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits. Michelle doesn't nail that motorbike stunt on her first try.

For my money, I did like the one alternate closing credits version in which Tom Jones sings ""Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting."" But this isn't that version. Anyway, 5 stars out of 5 for the movie. 2 stars for the Dragon Dynasty presentation and for not having enough bonus material, all that averaging the thing to... well, I'm going with 3 stars.",1280275200,,4051,4.8979591836734695

In fact there's a great interview with Jackie Chan where he complains about how the American versions of his movies are edited and not as good as the original versions! Ha!

This subsidiary of the Wienstien Company has gone to great lengths to release ultimate unedited editions of great Asian movies. Some of the films they are releasing were previously released on the Dimension home video label and are being re-released under the Dynasty label with more special features and..well most of the time...unedited versions of the Asian release. The Jet Li film Twin Warriors (as titled on the Dimension release) was re-released unedited under the title Tia Chi Master. I was hoping for the same with Supercop.

Sadly the the Dragon Dynasty release of Supercop is just a more special featured filled version of the earlier Dimension release because,for some reason unknown, Dyanasty has only released the American cut of the film. Where is my unedited/non-tinkered with version of Police Story III: Supercop? Instead we get the same edited American release with a different score, added hip-hop soundtrack, and a lame title sequence. This is a shame because I have always been extremely happy with Dragon Dynasty's releases so far. Why not include both the U.S. and Asian version as they did with The Proctor DVD? Extremely disappointing.

It was the first film in the franchise not to be directed by Jackie but instead by Stanley Tong. It was also the last film in the series to feature actress Maggie Cheung as Jackie's girlfriend.

The first disc features an engaging audio commentary by Hong Kong cinema expert Bey Logan. He talks about the differences between this version and the Hong Kong version. For example, there were different opening credits and musical scores for each version. This begs the question, why wasn't the Hong Kong version included on this supposedly ""Ultimate Edition?"" Logan provides brief biographical information on Michelle Yeoh and Maggie Cheung as well as a wealth of production details on this very informative track.

The second disc starts with a real treat: ""Flying High: An Exclusive Interview with Star Jackie Chan."" He talks about working with director Stanley Tong, who, at the time, was a young director. Jackie talks about working with Yeoh and speaks admiringly of her ability to do her own stunts. He also recalls how scared he was doing the helicopter sequence.

""Dancing with Death: An Interview with Leading Lady Michelle Yeoh."" She had a background in ballet and only started doing martial arts when she did her first action film. She learned something new on every subsequent film. Yeoh talks about how she got into acting and speaks eloquently and warmly in this engaging interview.

""The Stuntmaster General: An Exclusive Interview with Director Stanley Tong."" He talks about working with Jackie over five films and how they collaborate together. He talks about the challenge of doing the stunts in the film without CGI.

""The Fall Guy: An Exclusive Interview with Jackie Chan Bodyguard, Training Partner and Co-Star Ken Lo."" He recounts his first meeting with Jackie when he was bouncer and the action star asked him if he would like to work in films. they have worked together for 20 years.

Supercop is a fun, exciting and entertaining film that you would expect from Jackie Chan. It has all kinds of cheesy jokes, top notch fight scenes and insanely choreographed chase sequences, all done without the assistance of computer technology. In this day and age there is something refreshing about that.",1231718400,,2370,5.033163265306122

3559107,5,B001F0TM3K,"Basically the 3rd movie in the Police Story series (First Strike is the 4th and last), Supercop has very little connections to the 1st 2 Poilce Story movies, which were very closely related.  Jackie Chan returns as Kevin Chan, and his girlfriend Mei is still played by Maggie Cheung.  I have seen Supercop numerous time, and each time its like watching it for the 1st.  The story is better than many Chan films, and the action and stunts are easily amongst the best.

The story, takes itself a little more seriously than some Chan films, say compared to Mr. Nice Guy or Rumble in The Bronx.  The humor is more of a minum because of that, but there's still a funny couple good moments.  I think the plot is interesting and suspensful, taking advantage of Kevin Chan playing an undercover agent throughout the movie.  His sidekick, or should I say boss, throughout the film is played by Michelle Yeoh, also undercover along side him, and gives an equally great performance in the film.  The dubbing is far better than most films, and if you prefer Jackie Chan's own English voice, he provied his own dub in Supercop.

The action is used sparingly throughout the beginning of the film, making everything run a little slow.  But the movie begins to progress more and more nicely throughout.  The finale is huge.  15 minutes of straight all out action from fights to some of, if not, the best stunts ever done.  Chan jums on and hangs from a helicopter ladder over the city, and Michelle Yeoh hangs off the side of a van for dear life and steers a motorcyle right up ontop a moving train.  Its all real and its must see.

Fan or no fan of Jackie Chan, this is just an all out great movie.  No its not recognized as a masterpiece, but in a slightly smaller world this is A++ entertainment.",1178755200,,1783,4.490683229813665

Especially the first part of the movie playing in mainland China is different. In this part, Michelle Yeoh as Chinese officer is a bit overdone, however the prison break is a really remarkable piece of JC cinema. The following part of the movie features a resort type adventure with typical 'early JC' slapstick components. The last part of the movie plays in Malaysia and contains non-stop action, which some never seen before stunts including a bike ride on a train plus a helicopter landing on the same train.

All in all a very entertaining JC movie, featuring different Asian locations and a high tension, super action sequence at the end. Watching the 'making of' is also recommended because it really shows the difficulties to perform the stunt sequences for this movie. The only drawback of this movie are some overdone and a bit ridicoulos slapstick scenes.

3559115,4,B001F0TM3K,"Originally released in Hong Kong as Police Story III, Supercop teams up Hong Kong action god Jackie Chan along with Hong Kong action goddess Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) for a 90-minute match made in Hong Kong action heaven.
THE STORY:
Kevin Chan (Jackie), Hong Kong's recognized Supercop, is assigned on a special mission to team-up with a Red Chinese female cop, Jessica Yang (Yeoh), to infiltrate and take down a ruthless Southeast Asian crimelord.
The story winds itself throughout all of Southeast Asia including Hong Kong, the Chinese countryside, the jungles of the Thai-Cambodian border and finally to the busy streets of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
If infiltrating the inner circle of a ruthless crimelord and not getting your cover blown is bad enough, things become just a bit more complicated for Chan and Yang when Kevin's girlfriend (Maggie Cheung), unaware that Chan is on assignment, shows up at the same location that the investigation leads them too!!!
Overall it's the usual action tour-de-force you've all come to love and expect from the typical Jackie Chan flick and this movie does not disappoint with tons of shoot outs as well as the usual hand-to-hand combat.  The real keeper in this movie though are the more outrageous stunts that are done, especially the movie-ending fight scenes on the train and a flying helicopter which features Chan going for a wild ride all over Kuala Lumpur.
THE DVD:
Well, if you're hoping for a pretty loaded DVD, you've come to the wrong place as this DVD features nothing beyond the chapter breaks and Spanish language subtitles.  Easily, this is the most disappointing Chan DVD I've come across yet.  The DVD is good strictly in the sense that this decent action flick is now preserved for digital posterity with a decent DVD navigation system.
THE VERDICT:
Overall, if you're into good action flicks, Supercop does the trick for you.  While the actual fight scenes may not be as elaborate as some of the other movies Chan's had released in the US, this one does not disappoint.  The story is pretty decent and the dangerous stunts at the end in K.L. are pretty adrenaline pumping.  Overall, whether bought, rented or borrowed, this movie is definitely worth the watch.

Her acting is showcased better in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and she is probably more accessible to American audiences in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" but this is still one of my favorite movies for Michelle.
Jackie Chan uses fewer props (i.e. ladders, bar stools, pool cues)in the fight sequences than usual but is none the less his dynamic self. The plot is, well...who watches Jackie Chan movies for the plot?  And the English voice-overs are typical of this film genre.

The story is utter nonsense. Stanley Tong is  one of Hong Kong's finest directors because he does everything he can to  drop his star into the danger zone with a minimum of distractions. Follow  the superfluous plot and you might figure out that Chan is undercover in a  Chinese labor camp, aiding the escape of a thug who deserves to be there.  After that it's the requisite night boat to Hong Kong where we meet the  evil supercreep who makes the godfather look like a postal clerk.

And you can't beat the final surface to air  mega-chase. It's a car, it's a train, it's a helipcopter--it's all three.  Yow! that looks dangerous.

Yes,  it features Michelle Khan who is the best physical partner Chan has had in  a movie but the film suffers from long absences of Chan and too much  villain plotting.

The  movie, while humorous at certain points, also feels a bit too violent.  Sure, there have been far bloodier action films but Supercop doesn't feel  as lighthearted as his other features and it even has Chan killing a few  bad guys with a machine gun.

(Oddly enough, though Jackie didn't do much martial artistry in this film,  someone -- an American distributor, I'm guessing? -- thought it would be  cute to have ""(Everybody Was) Kung Fu Fighting"" playing over the  credits/outtakes -- OUCH!)

I agree, but *Supercop*  rates fairly high in my opinion.  The movie did serve as a comeback vehicle  for Michelle Khan/Yeoh, so most 90s Chan films feature many more of his  stunts. *Supercop*, US theatrical release, remained fairly true to the  Asian *Police Story III*,"" unlike several others (notably, *Rumble in  the Bronx*/*Red Bronx*).  For this reason, *Supercop* is a good buy and  serves as a fair representative of his work.  Both casual viewers and fans  will enjoy the insane action (especially Michelle Yeoh's motorcycle  stunts!) through repeated viewings.  Also, if *Supercop* doesn't make you  hunger for more Jackie, then you probably won't like the two or three Chan  films (out of several dozen) that might be consistently better.  Also, I  don't understand the R rating on this one; I've seen many PG-13 movies  containing worse and/or more graphic violence than *Supercop.*  Parents  should be aware that Chan never glorifies violence, but *Supercop* contains  more gunplay than most of his films.",926035200,,1357,5.138248847926267

8300274,5,B001F0TM3K,"Do I love Supercop? I. Love. Supercop. The third entry in Jackie Chans Police Story series is fast-paced, jam-packed with incredible action and some of Chans best stunts of his career, his trademark humor and simply a winning personality that fires on all cylinders. Chans gung ho police officer Kevin gets duped into going undercover in mainland China to take down Chaibots drug running business. In order to do so he gets inserted into a prisoner internment camp to help Chaibots #1 gun Panther escape. This escape sequence has a great scene of Chan and Panther running up a steep grade and it will make you lose your breath you watching it! But the fun starts well before this scene as Chan, after travelling to China and meeting with his assigned mainland partner, Inspector Yang (Michelle Yeoh most famous as a female spy from the James Bond entry Tomorrow Never Dies), who grills him over learning his undercover dossier. Chans Kevin is cocky and self-assured and this gets him in little bits of trouble with her and the two have a good chemistry. A great martial art fight sequence is another one of those bits of trouble Chan gets in when Yang tells her captive audience of potential recruits that Kevin the supercop will demonstrate how tough he is by sparring with an imposing trainee. Chan brings his trademark humor to a scintillatingly choreographed fight sequence here and while he holds his own against the trainee he is getting hurt and comically interrupts the sparring session by grabbing onto a round balance roller that he doesnt know how to use and rolls off wildly into the bushes. Its perfectly timed and naturally funny. Im already starting to get ready to highlight a bunch of other scenes but that will ruin the review so Ill hold myself back. But you do have to see to believe the helicopter + train fight sequence, the on-your-feet action of a foiled military shoot-out with Chan and Yeoh (both playing undercover as brother and sister) hitting all of their marks, and the fun goofy moments of Chan trying to keep his cover from being blown by his girlfriend (May, played by the too-cute Maggie Cheung) whom he accidentally comes into contact with at a hotel pool (he prevents her from seeing him clearly at one point by smushing his face between the vinyl vertical straps of a poolside barca loungerclever and inventive)! Okay, I said Ill stop so Ill stop. But Supercop doesnt stop and its a terrifically fun flick! My personal favorite Chan film.",1487635200,,2476,4.76046511627907
