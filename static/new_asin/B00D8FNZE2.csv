5777228,4,B00D8FNZE2,i enjoyed the story itself more then the overall production of the movie anyone with eyes can see that this was a very low budget movie and for that reason i didn't expect it to be mind a young guns or a clint eastwood movie so i enjoyed it good story bad name.,1377734400,,261,3.943396226415094
5777229,1,B00D8FNZE2,"This movie sucks! Worse movie ever made. Bad everything. Whoever made it, should come out and apologize . This movie is not even worth a dollar to rent",1377648000,,151,4.428571428571429
5777230,4,B00D8FNZE2,"Don't expect Sam Peckinpah's ""Wild Bunch"" or Corbucci's ""Great Silence"".  Overall it's an entertaining story of Billy The Kid and his fictional origins.  The actors are amateur/sub-par, given it's a low-budget western with no lead actor to take charge of the film, it's not a terrible concept.

I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I knew what I was getting into when I bought the DVD.

A low-budget movie marketed with the name of a famous OUTLAW.

The best features this film has to offer is good music, interesting plot and beautiful landscape.",1377475200,,545,4.6947368421052635
5777231,1,B00D8FNZE2,"""That town's dangerous right now."" After an outlaw gang threatens to take over the town of Dogma a lone bounty hunter named Leon comes in a kills the leader. When the rest of the gang hears about this they are looking for revenge. This is another movie in the long line of what I have started to call the $5 western...because the movies look like they were made for $5. The acting is pretty bad but that is expected in a movie like this. Also it's hard to tell if it's the acting that is bad or if its the writing or a mix of the two. The ""gunfights"" are laughable but that isn't the biggest complaint I have of this movie. The movie is called Billy The Kid...but the character of Billy only is in it for about 5 minutes. This is pretty much an origin story of why Billy was like he was. Overall, pretty much what I expected from a $5 western. I give it a D+.",1377475200,4,859,4.0588235294117645

5777262,1,B00D8FNZE2,"Why do all country singers think they can act well enough to play lead roles in westerns when their in their 40's or 50's?  This movie was just plain terrible.  Bad acting, terrible casting, throw the history book out the window.  You have a 20 year old Billy The Kid who has never killed a man (Billy was killing men in his early teens!) and terrible hair.  This movie gave way to dozens of questions -- like was the west really filled with fat old men with bellies hanging way over their belts running around trying to be gunfighters?  How come the sheriffs are all old men?  Come on guys.  Try casting some younger guys in these newer westerns, and get ones that can act.",1400630400,,674,4.344

5777264,1,B00D8FNZE2,"Where to begin? We didn't make it more than 1.5 min before pausing and bursting into laughter. We did however endure the entirety of it for a good laugh. Besides the terrible acting there were many obvious mistakes throughout. The blood splatter looked reminiscent of what it's like to play a first person shooter arcade game. There was more than one scene where the blood splatter pattern didn't match the direction of the gunshot. Like others have said, you could see the guns were so fake they didn't have holes in the barrels. The guns also shot out a lot of smoke, that's not accurate for those types of guns. And why couldn't that guy hit the other guy with his back turned at point blank with a shotgun? He wasn't even looking at the guy. Let's not forget the pink and purple earplugs you could see the actors wearing. Is this the new Plan 9 From Outer Space? A film so badly put together they use it in film school as an example of what NOT to do. Wait, there's more! How about the guy that was so shaky with Parkinson's or something that I couldn't concentrate on the scene at all. And then there's the inappropriate heavy metal music. Wow, I could go on but I think you get the point.",1388793600,6,1194,4.358744394618834
5777265,1,B00D8FNZE2,"As a 19 Century Western history fan I was very excited when I became aware of this movie. I could not wait to watch a new, modern movie based on the life of William Bonney. My excitement was quickly turned to horrid regret as my eyes watched what could only be described as community theatre on the prairie. Some ''director'' told a bunch of people to come to his backyard and pretend to be in a movie. The acting in this movie is terrible, the gun fights are ridiculously staged, and the storyline is fictitious and scattered. ""Billy the Kid"" appears for 3 or 4 minutes total leaving me wondering why in the world they named the movie after him. It should have been titled ""Worst Movie You'll Ever See"". I decided I deserve to write, direct, and act in my own movie just because I sat through this entire monstrosity. If you are considering watching this movie go into it with extremely low expectations. Maybe you'd enjoy it more than I did.",1381708800,,943,4.456647398843931
5777266,5,B00D8FNZE2,"I loved this movie. It sure wasn't your same old cookie cutter Hollywood western. It was more like the classic westerns, but with a modern look. Some of the scenery alone was worth the price of the DVD. It was also great to see Country Music Star, Cody McCarver in a staring roll and also to hear some of his music in the film. He reminded my wife and I of a modern day Matt Dillon.",1380499200,,382,4.0394736842105265
5777267,1,B00D8FNZE2,This is a bottom of the barrel film we only watched it for 10-15 minutes and deleted it because the acting was so bad.,1378771200,,118,3.9583333333333335
5777268,1,B00D8FNZE2,"While the film has the title ""Billy the Kid"" it is more about a fictional bounty hunter named Leon Copper(Cody McCarver). In this film Billy (Christopher Bowman) goes from not knowing how to shot a gun to being an expert with two minutes of practice. This is a low budget, poorly acted western. In real life, Billy's mother died from tuberculous.

The house that Billy lives in apparently has a time machine in the back as the front porch has a modern door lock and lights with small light bulbs. Not worth the price of a rental. Leon, is hunting outlaws in the town of Dalton. He kills one and then discovers that his ""wife"" and son are living there after being gone 20 years. The dialouge was read without feeling.

5777271,5,B00D8FNZE2,"Being an old fashioned western fan I was pleasantly surprised to see this new take on Billy The Kid. The gunfights, scenic vistas, and ruthless cowboys remind me of the early Clint Eastwood directed films and relay the desolation and struggles of the old west perfectly. Its not an easy task to make one of the most ruthless gunfighters a likable guy but that's what this Billy The Kid film does to a tee. Hoping a sequel gets made as there needs to be more story driven action packed westerns like this and Lionsgate is the company to do it!!!",1377734400,2,544,4.45

Acting is so pathetically bad, it even rivals the acting job of my first ex-wife. This could easily rate as the worst movie that I have ever seen, except that the number of truly horrible movies I've seen has risen drastically the past few years with my Amazon prime subscription, as well as other streaming services that rhyme with wet chicks.

8590557,1,B00D8FNZE2,"This has to be one of the most bizarre, amateurish, cringe-worthy productions ever released as a feature film.  Incredibly strained performances, cheese-ball cliches and unintentional goofing in the absurd script, direction and cinematography that seem like they were part of a high school film project by inept juveniles.  This isn't even worthy of being dubbed ""so bad it's a laugher"" in the midnight movie tradition.  The jarring edits make me wonder what kind of hallucinogenic the editor was on, and the lighting seems to have been done by someone without a clue--harsh lighting in extreme closeups, etc. How this filmmaker manages to keep financing his low-budget fiascos is a mystery, but I guess theres always someone who wants to be part of the movie biz. This ranks among the most awful films I've ever had the displeasure to attempt to watch.  Believe me, 15-20 minutes of this was all I could take, but I feel confident in assuming the rest of it was just as terrible.",1525305600,,980,4.885542168674699

8590560,2,B00D8FNZE2,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2013 and directed by Christopher Forbes, Billy the Kid covers events when a bounty hunter (Cody McCarver) rides into the Southwestern town of Dogma intent on taking down a gang of outlaws called ""The Four of the Apocalypse."" Meanwhile, he meets a woman he knew years before (Kimberly Campbell) and her son, Billy (Christopher Bowman). Jerry Chesser emerges as the formidable main heavy.

This movie only cost $500,000 so you have to be able to stomach micro-budget independent flicks and the limitations thereof in order to appreciate any attributes. I like watching spare-change films now and then and sorta root for them like you would a severely underdog team in sports. While there are some highlights in this film, like the soundtrack/score, some picturesque scenes and a few of the main cast members (noted above), the script needed more work because the story bogs down after the opening act.

For instance, theres a lousy side plot about a goofy red-haired outlaw camping out in the town jailhouse and having a shootout with two old men. Most of the peripheral cast members aren't very good and the action scenes are okay at best, but neither wouldve been much of a hindrance if the story was strong and compelling. In short, without an engaging story everything else is worthless. Dont get me wrong, the plot had potential, but the script needed a lot more work.

Interestingly, while the events are supposed to take place in New Mexico, the movie was shot mainly in South Carolina with a couple sequences done in Georgia and Kentucky. How could the creators possibly pull this off and make it look like the story takes place in the Southwest? Answer: They utilized several establishing shots from Lincoln County, New Mexico (with some featuring the loner protagonist). But everything else, like the lame town set, was shot in the East.

No doubt the WORST ""professional"" movie I've ever seen. Watched it to the end because we kept hoping for some comedic twist like Godzilla or aliens because it was seriously that bad. I don't know how it ever made it to print and even to a red box. Did someone sex their way to a signed contract?? How could anyone sit back and look at this finished product and think, ""ya, that's perfect"". No. No it isn't. It's a complete waste of your dollars and time.
