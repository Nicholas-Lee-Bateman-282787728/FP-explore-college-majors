1654332,5,B00005R7YL,"before seeing the video, I was lucky enough to see it in a cinema with Diane Disney and Jean-pierre Isbouts in the room, in english without subtitles, playing for a belgian audience, it was in the dutch speaking part of the country (of course) and my party and I were the only french speaking people there. I couldn't stop crying during the whole movie, the emotion was just to much. I could talk to Jean-Pierre himself and his mother, forgot to take pictures and ask for autographs (stupid me)
a few days later, an american pen friend set me not exactly the video but the film taped from ABC including the commercial breaks with GREAT commercials for the parks, speeches by Michael Eisner and very touching tribute to the september11 victims by the Disney Company, I watch that tape all the time but still intend to buy the video someday, and DVD if there's one.
All those familiar faces like Frank Thomas, the Shermans... and that film enabled me to see AT LAST what Disney child stars like Karen Dotrice and Kevin Corcoran look like today (",1020384000,14,1043,4.5828877005347595

The never before released photos and film footage alone make this a ""must"" purchase.  If the production has one fault, it may be that it leaves the viewer wanting more such glimpses into the life of Walt Disney.

This is nearly two hours of pure delight, watching the unique man who took huge risks to give birth to the phenomenon of the Disney empire.  One reviewer who worked with and for him said that Disney was ""an ordinary man with extraordinary gifts.""  A very simple and likable little boy who never grew up and never forgot what it was to be a child with the dreams of a child.  Reminds me of Steve Jobs, in that he was one who motivated others to give beyond what they thought they could ever do in order to achieve what others called perfection.  We need to remember that ""Walt"" did that long ago.",1394582400,,724,4.373134328358209

Seeing the home videos, placing you in Kansas at the turn of the Century, the reason why he created Disney Land, taking you through the important early milestones of Disney Films, his vision for Disney World (and why it is fundamentally different than Disney Land), it is a treat to watch.

Adults I think will get a much better appreciation of this DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1375833600,,503,4.5054945054945055
1654354,2,B00005R7YL,"I thought this program would provide visual details of the complexity of Walt's life, but it did not. His successes and failures over many years. His father was very abusive but not described in detail in program. His life was a struggle to create a living, to do the things he loved, and to not be cheated. People took advantage of him.

It also ignored his later search for his true family identity. His father was so cruel to he and brother that Walt doubted that he was his father [adapted]. And a birth certificate could not be found which led to a worldwide search. Finally, no real answer could be found.

His heavy smoking lead to his death. He barely lived long enough to see Disneyland built.

This program ignored the most of struggles he had in life which as a result, made the successes not seem as great. I think his family produced this program and smoothed over the difficult days.",1368835200,,897,4.49079754601227

1654363,5,B00005R7YL,"Yes, for Disney fans, this is a must-own DVD. But even for those of us who have mixed feelings about Disney Inc. and its business practices, this is an inspiring, and probably true-to-life biography of the man himself (who preferred to be called Walt).

There is the usual mix of sugar and sweetness, but you'll also see the warts.

What I found most fascinating is the wealth of old footage: home movies, Walt's early cartoons, how things operated in the early days of Disney Studios. His life certainly seemed to be charmed, be it in business or in love.

Disney was the ultimate family man: it didn't seem to be an act. Sometimes he was an average Joe, preferring crackers and beans on business outings, while at other times, his excessive self-indulgence had a high wince factor (building his own railroad on his property just didn't strike me as charming).

Surprisingly, he was a man who didn't believe in positive reinforcement for a job well done. In a way, he pioneered the mindset of today's corporations (that is, be thankful you have a job, and don't expect much in the way of compensation). Again, the self indulgence: Uncle Walt gets almost everything, and everyone else gets...just enough, no more, no less.

This DVD is highly recommended.",1265414400,,1255,4.791666666666667
1654364,5,B00005R7YL,"For anyone interested in a visual biography of Walt Disney and the studio he built -this is it! Executively produced by Walt's grandson Walter Elias Disney Miller and narrated by Dick Van Dyke, it's a wonderful tribute to one of the most iconic men of the twentieth century.

Van Dyke details the family history with never seen before home movies and photographs. It's a well balanced documentary with participation from the people who really knew Walt and who had worked on many of his creations. The famed ""Nine Old-Men"", the very animators who spent their whole lives at the studio,tell us why they were so devoted to a man who never offered personal praise.  You'll learn about the negative side too, the bitter 1941 animation strike, the accusations of racism and of Walt being anti-semetic, are also truely laid to rest. The birth of Disneyland, television and live-action are all included in this well paced two hour salute.

Their are secrets to be learned, like how Mickey Mouse came about. How the animation process works, with plenty of footage from Disney classics to illustrate why they were the best and most inovative. Walt surrounded himself with good people, he was a master motivator and ideas man. But he was also human and that is well brought out, specially with his family. It's a great drawn to scale, down-to-earth look at a man, that most people only thought of in mythological terms.",1243641600,2,1409,4.838174273858921
1654365,5,B00005R7YL,"This documentary, produced by Walt's grandson and first male namesake, is a wonderful look back at the incredible life of one of America's greatest citizens, Walter Elias Disney.  I worked for Disney and went through their famous ""Traditions"" training, but I was still constantly surprised and informed by this film.  It is an unflinching look at his life, the good and the bad.  I disagree with some reviewers that it ""glosses over"" some of the things he is accused of being.  In reality it confronts those issues head-on and uses first hand accounts to mostly dissipate those rumors and allegations.  I especially loved the early movies of his life and family and the detailed descriptions and films depicting his original dream for EPCOT.
A must watch movie, if you are any kind of Disney fan.  It seems to me that Disney's life was truly blessed by an incredible gift of imagination, creativity, and love for his fellow man.",1241395200,,928,4.841772151898734

My 11 year old son actually requested this book to do his final book project at school this year. They had to dress up and portray the person in the book, so my son slicked his hair back, donned a mustache and suit, and gave his presentation.

1654372,5,B00005R7YL,"Walt- The Man Behind the Myth is an outstanding DVD for anybody wishing to learn more of Walt or Disney history. The film follows Walt's life well and shows a generous amount of never before seen footage. Walt was a private man at home so it's exciting to see a better look into his family life. The film received a lot of input and work done by Walt's only surviving daughter (Diane Disney Miller) and his grandson (Walter Elias Disney Miller). The documentary contains interviews with the people that knew him best, as well as a few of the Nine Old Men that were alive at that time. Dick Van Dyke narrarates a really compelling and interesting story about a man that changed the world and bettered everything he touched. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with the slightest interest in Walt Disney. I only wish there was more for me to watch. I also recommend the book with the same cover image which closely follows the film titled ""Inside the Dream: The Personal Story of Walt Disney"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-the-Dream-The-Personal-Story-of-Walt-Disney/dp/0786853506/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside the Dream: The Personal Story of Walt Disney</a>",1178928000,4,1210,5.373684210526315

It keeps the viewers attention with ample film footage of Walt at work and giving riveting interviews. I especially enjoyed the part where they show Walt Disney's first studio as it was in the twenties and as it is now because I live a few blocks from the location.

My only complaint about the film is it cuts off a lot of Walt Disney's interviews after only a few comments, which appeared very interesting on the screen.  It would be nice to see Walt Disney's interviews in their entirety.",1124928000,9,580,4.666666666666667
1654375,4,B00005R7YL,"It was great seeing a more balanced biography of Walt Disney after all these years. I felt like there have always been 2 extremes: the sugary and perfect Walt who loved children, and the diabolic Communist smasher that hated Jews.

Well, here's a news flash: he was human. Walt was a taskmaster, and perfectionist, but he was dedicated to entertaining people and making them laugh. This movie showed us how he was a 12-year old at heart, full of the vigor that made his cartoons great and prone to being naive when it came to labor and politics.

To work for Walt was probably a rollercoaster, being ""under the eyebrow"" one moment when he was concentrating on a project, then elated when he dispensed a single iota of praise from his gruff businessman persona. The next second he could transform himself into a character from the storyboard he was demonstrating, brimming with energy and enthusiasm like a middle-aged Huck Finn.

People have tried to villify him over the years, pecking away and trying to drag down his overly-sweet reputation perpetuated by the studio after his death. But you can say this about him: he loved childern, wanted to make people laugh, and in some small way felt that by making the childhood of others happier, he was a happy child himself.",1123718400,39,1271,4.742081447963801

1654377,5,B00005R7YL,"I watched this documentary twice and was greatly inspired by it.

1654378,5,B00005R7YL,"I am a Disney fan plain and simple.  I grew up watching ""The Wonderful World of Disney"", going to Disneyland more than six times in my life and visiting Walt Disney World once.  I buy Disney DVD's and other products from the Disney line. However, I knew a little about the man who created the ""magic"" and after viewing this outstanding DVD about the life of Walt Disney, I feel like I know him so much more.
This is an account about the life and thoughts of the man who created a world where people are more happier today because of the dreams shared by Walt Disney.  The film begins with Walt's childhood in Missouri and California.  There are family films that are shown for the first time with the permission of the Disney family that show the love and warmth not only of Walt, but of his family and friends.
The film also tells about his early workings in creating cartoon characters, working and paying his dues in the entertainment industry of the 1920's and finally with a bold stroke, creating his own studio where Walt could finally create much of the magic that we enjoy today.  The film also tells about the work and creation that went into full length animated movies such as ""Snow White"", ""Bambi"", ""Pinnochio"", and other classic masterpieces.  Also shown is the vision that led to the construction of Disneyland and Walt's final dream...Epcot Center.
The film also has moving interviews with intimate Disney family members such as Walt and Lillian's daughter Diane, grandson Walt Elias Disney Miller, grandaughters, grandnieces and grandnephews.  Close family friends such as Art Linkletter, Dean Jones, Ray Bradberry, and the late Buddy Epsen are interviewed as well as early live Disney stars such as Dean Jones.
Each give a wonderful insight into Walt Disney and all still show loving devotion to him even 37 years after his death.
Walt Disney definitely made the world a better place to live him and we can thank him for giving us a magical place to escape to everyday by watching the films, going to the amusement parks and so much more, because of his magical immagination.
Every Disney fan will enjoy watching this DVD over and over again.
