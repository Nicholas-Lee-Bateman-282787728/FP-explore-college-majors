8379127,5,B002S8M1SQ,"As for the 1st review, I don't think this person fully viewed all Erik Dalton's dvds. In the first lesson of shoulder, arm & hand, it was video with clothing, but starting in the 2nd lesson on thoracic outlet, was video very well! I have watch all Art Riggs, James Waslaski, Til Luchau & Erik Dalton's dvds! As a beginner, I watched Art Riggs's dvd and loved his dvds and than I watch James Waslaski and thought he was great, too. By the time I watch Til Luchau, I kind of got lost. But, when I watched Erik Dalton's dvds, I really felt his dvds were by far more advanced and easier to understand Til Luchau to me.",1426377600,4,614,4.211864406779661
8379128,2,B002S8M1SQ,"The instruction is good but on the shoulder, hand, and arm DVDs it could be better. Also on those two DVDs the view is obscured by clothes, a bad camera angle and sometimes the audio goes very quiet. There isn't much content to these DVDs. There are better deals out there. Til Luchau's advanced myofascial techniques set is much cheaper. You get 5 courses that cover the whole body. It comes with 10 DVD's and 5 Workbooks for the same price as you get for 4 DVDs of Erik's.  I wonder what I was thinking by paying more for less...I guess I paid for a name. It is OK but it isn't worth the price they are asking.",1374537600,9,612,4.186440677966102
8379129,5,B002S8M1SQ,Dr. Dalton is a master at his craft and it shows in these great DVDs. This set is going to change everything in my practice.,1355875200,2,124,4.0
