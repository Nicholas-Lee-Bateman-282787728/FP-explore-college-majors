3880518,4,B0029R81I0,This is a great series and a nice peek into our Naitonal parks.  Great for my aging parents who will likely not be able to visit them all.,1357171200,,138,3.9285714285714284
3880519,5,B0029R81I0,"Total enjoyment due to the full complete pictures and experence given on all of the locations on each of the Parks.

Have suggested these to be obturned to the purchase.",1315958400,,169,4.633333333333334
3880520,3,B0029R81I0,I was hoping for a travelogue showing the beautiful parks.  Instead I felt like I was attending a college lecture put on by an environmental engineer.  The parks were simply backgrounds for various scientists and nature freaks to express their concern that all the parks will be destroyed by people.  Much preferred the Ken Burns documentary.,1313539200,10,342,5.071428571428571
3880521,4,B0029R81I0,"Not on par with BBC series, but well done and definitely worth the time to watch. Greatly enjoyed the series.",1311292800,,109,4.5
3880522,1,B0029R81I0,"This set of 7 DVD's IS a Very Disappointing Collection.
A very ODDBALL Media player for Windows XP SP3 Operating System Keeps trying to install;  That fails & gives a vague error message about a  'Direct-X' ""problem""  .

The web site for the FLAWED cd/media reader help is DOWN___Surprise Surprise !!!!!!!

  Only the Map feature will play correctly.
I HAVE the CURRENT Microsoft Software & updates!

The Nat Geo Store has cancelled production of the 7 dvd set & now offers a 10 dvd set for National Parks.

The Nat Geo CHOICE of OUTSOURCE Software in this case is a TOTAL FAILURE !!!!!",1310688000,5,586,4.611650485436893
3880523,2,B0029R81I0,I have visited these parks several times over the last 40 years and was very disapointed in these dvd's. I returned them for credit.,1309651200,16,132,4.541666666666667
3880524,2,B0029R81I0,"As a previous reviewer of this DVD set noted, these five ""National Parks"" programs were produced for television. As such, they're skewed toward sensationalism and lots of ""gloom-and-doom."" It's the gloom-and-doom that's tedious to watch, albeit there is some truth in it. Actually, the rock climber's three-day ascent of El Capitan on the Yosemite disc is quite impressive. The Yellowstone and Death Valley discs have their moments, whilst the Everglades and Hawaii programs put me to sleep. I've watched a half dozen DVD productions on America's national parks (including Ken Burns). The two best in my opinion are ""Treasures of America's National Parks"" (Questar Entertainment), and ""Great Lodges of the National Parks"" ([...]).",1274572800,36,730,5.469026548672566
3880525,1,B0029R81I0,"This set is not what you think it's going to be.  You'd think it was going to show each of the highlighted parks and show what makes each park unique; flora, fauna, natural formations, beautiful scenery.  Instead this series hits relentlessly up side the head with dire predictions about global warming and the horrible consequences of civilization.  Not once, but many times.  In the Death Valley disc, they mention global warming 12 times in one hour.

The message even flies in the face of science.  They talk about how parks have changed with it's habitat being constantly threatened by the hand of man and state quite clearly that the natural denizens will be unable to adapt to the changes when species adaptation is a well-founded scientific principle.

So if you're looking for wonderful travelogues showcasing our national parks, keep looking.

This was a great disappointment at many levels.",1269993600,67,901,5.04054054054054
3880526,1,B0029R81I0,"I thought the series would detail the National Parks listed.  It seems like the series is a collection of past National Geographic television episodes slapped together.  The ""Hidden Yosemite""  highlighted a climb up El Capitain-hardly a hidden feature of the park. The Hawaii episode was even lamer. I had purchased it as a gift and was very disappointed. Photography remains good.",1261353600,44,381,5.213114754098361
3880527,5,B0029R81I0,"I was searching for a video collection for the family library that showcased our National Parks and I found this product to be the perfect choice.  The product I purchased is on DVD and, as viewed on a 42"" plasma TV, I rate the production quality as top shelf.  The scenery was exceptional and the commentary was quite educational.  To gauge the entertainment value I can say the content was sufficient to hold the interest of my three boys, ages eight, ten and twelve.",1252713600,70,469,4.559523809523809

3880531,5,B0029R81I0,"I got this for my Father and he loves it.  He's watched it several times now and was really blown away with how beautiful it was.  I haven't seen it myself, so I can't leave any feedback other than to say it was a very well received gift.",1482883200,2,238,3.9375

3880535,5,B0029R81I0,Super Clear View of all these Great Parks. I often watch an hour of this before I go to sleep as it is very relaxing and helps me to wind down. The photography is amazing. It is hard to watch these and then say you haven't been there. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.,1424390400,2,259,4.0

3880541,1,B0029R81I0,Our family all find this low in information and too much of an attempt at high tech flashes and movning around angles but it makes us dizzy. There is not enough information about the park itself and the amenities of visiting the park.,1397606400,6,234,4.465116279069767

3880544,5,B0029R81I0,"I held off from buying this for a few months because of the negative reviews. I finally boought the 10 dvd set. This is a fantastic set. Very interesting and great video quality. The nay sayers must have a grudge against National Geographic? One person said in there review that in the DEATH VALLEY episode they mention GLOBAL WARMING 12 times. That is a flat out LIE! I watched that episode last night. The only time GLOBAL WARMING is mentioned is 1 time at the very end. They mention CLIMATE CHANGE several times. They mention it is UNCERTAIN what is causing CLIMATE CHANGE. I don't believe in GLOBAL WARMING. But, i have no problem with it being mentioned 1 time as long as they also mentioned CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT IS UNCERTAIN what is causing it. Only a FOOL would deny natural climate change not caused by man. But, i think it is important that all sides of an argument be heard. After all, free thought is OK as long as they are honest with the facts. This is a fantastic set to compliment the KEN BURNS NATIONAL PARKS sets i own. The film footage in this set is AWESOME. So what if you don't agree with every single statement. If you are that narrow minded maybe you should move into a cave.",1387238400,14,1199,4.381165919282512
3880545,4,B0029R81I0,I bought this for my dad. He just loves it. I wish theywould have subtitle for those who are not native english speakers so that they could look up the words they don't know.,1374796800,4,174,4.147058823529412
3880546,5,B0029R81I0,We love our National Parks collection of DVDs. Have placed many of the parks on our bucket list. Great way to travel without leaving your easy chair. Scenery is gorgeous!,1364169600,2,170,4.7
3880547,5,B0029R81I0,I appreciated the set of DVD's and felt that it came in a timely manner as I remember. I believe I posted a rating on this last year so am confused why it is asked for again.,1360713600,,174,3.72972972972973

8358090,5,B0029R81I0,"I happen to love the national parks, I've been to about 15 of them over the past 10 years, and there is nothing I love more than spending time sightseeing America by car.  A lot of people haven't had the opportunity, and don't know where to start - this collection should help.
I bought this video based on the reviews, I actually haven't seen it.  I bought it as a gift for a retiring co-worker who will have a lot of free time on his hands.  After watching the first two DVD's, he told me it was fantastic !
If you have a wonderlust, and are planning a future trip, I would suggest you get this or one of the other videos.  Visiting these parks has to be on your bucket list.",1495756800,,677,4.106060606060606
