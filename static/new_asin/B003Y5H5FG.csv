4221940,4,B003Y5H5FG,"A man moves into a Las Vegas neighborhood, and he may or may not be a vampire. Well, he is a vampire, and that is why some of the locals are disappearing. A young man figures it out and decides to take action. This remake of a good 1985 film is actually an improvement of the original. It has been updated for modern day, with excellent visual effects, and 3D. There are some truly scary moments in this one, and the protagonists are likeable people who are easy to root for. Colin Farrell does a creepy turn as the vampire. This is a good horror film without being excessively violent.",1313884800,3,586,4.336363636363636
4221941,5,B003Y5H5FG,"Okay, I am a HUGE Fright Night fan.  I even enjoyed Fright Night part II, despite it's weak spots(less threatening and interesting villains, semi-rehash plot line).  The original Fright Night has all the things I love about that special time called the 80's in horror; boisterous special effects, tongue firmly in cheek, monsters, and really great make up effects and ever evolving visual effects.  It was a love letter to Hammer vampires and a send up of the 80's slasher trend that dominated the era and knocked over the traditional monsters.  I had heard about this remake several years ago and was aghast.  Nobody wanted Hollyweird to stay away from Fright Night more than me.  I was so shocked that the remake turned out to be not only good, but surprising, and totally fun.

Now I know some horror fans, fanboys in general really, automatically hate something when it's remade, and hate something when the remake changes or rearranges things from the original.  Let me warn you purists nerds out there right now, this thing changes all the characters around with the exception of 'Evil' Ed Thompson.  He's the same, and played quirkily by Christopher Mintz Plasse(Mc'Lovin).  Jerry Dandridge is no longer a semi-tragic seducer, but a cold predator with motives only a supernatural predator could understand, but the movie is goodly enough to let us in anyway.  Peter Vincent(the biggest change in character in the remake) is no longer an older, washed up, Hammer-esque horror movie star with a cheap late night horror show, but now a Chris Angel inspired Vegas magician whose show revolves around the occult and especially gothic vampire imagery.  Charley Brewster is no longer the nerd next store, but rather a reformed nerd who is a status seeker, trying desperately to hide his old nerd ways to his new 'cool' friends, and super hot girlfriend Amy.  Amy is still the most thankless role, but she gets a bit of fleshing out before the third act and truly comes off sympathetic.

Now, like the Halloween remakes, I'm sure most will be upset by the revamped Peter Vincent, but I quite enjoyed the concept and David Tennant's performance.  He's crude, drunk, and hiding some secrets from Charlie that the film will reveal.  They did a good job of connecting Vincent to the main vampire plot this time out.  One of the weaker spots of the original film was the logic behind Charlie going to a known actor for help killing a vampire.  It never made a whole lot of sense, but it was fun anyway.  In this version there's some logic there and a brilliantly over the top set piece that takes place in Vincent's Apartment in Vegas.

In the original film Charlie Brewster was your basic straight man.  He had to play the auidience and the stalwart hero to root for.  The cool bit about this character in the original is that writer/director Tom Holland made him a horror hip nerd(long before Scream's Randy).  In the remake we find that Charlie is ashamed of his nerd past and he is seeking cool status in high school.  He's not very likeable at the out set.  His old nerd best friend Evil Ed informs him that one of their old chums has gone missing and possibly murdered, and Charlie just wants to hear none of it and be left alone.  You're not rooting for Charlie.  That's until he makes his first selfless act for a stripper neighbor entangled in a Jerry Dandridge trap.  Charlie has a full blow arch in this film.  I really enjoyed them taking the vanilla out of the vanilla hero in this remake.

Oh, Jerry, my favorite vampire of the 80's this side of David Bowie and Kiefer Sutherland.  In the original Chris Sarandon's performance is brilliant and as written the character is better than the one presented here.  That's just a fact.  Jerry in the original seems tragic, but willing to do what he has to do to survive and to keep his secret.  This may seem like sacrilege to most fans but I was never a fan of the plot point in the original of Charlie's girlfriend Amy being the reincarnation of Jerry's long lost love.  It's too contrived and convenient and really unnecessary to the story at the end of the film.  Amy gets used basically as the bait for Charlie and Peter to come after Jerry into his trap.  In this film Jerry is pure predator.  Now one must understand why this was done.  In my opinion this film was not competing with the original portrayal of Jerry, but rather all the recent tragic, weepy, romantic vampires that have come along from True Blood, Vampire Diaries and most especially Twilight.  The writer of this film Marti Noxon(staff writer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series for years) was trying to create the ultimate anti-Twilight vampire in all his rated R glory. Colin Farrell is an excellent choice for this and his performance manages to be unshowy but rather subverssive.  He has a great scene where he threatens Charlie in between the lines after Ed goes missing(which unlike the original film is in the first 15 minutes so that doesn't count as a spoiler).  He's truly menacing and perfect for this role.  Plus, as a bonus original film's Jerry(Chris Sarandon) shows up for a funny cameo that had me cheering when I recognized his face.

Anton Yelchin is a young actor I feel should be looked for.  This is his second starring role after Charlie Bartlet and he manages to earn our sympathy and complete a delicate arch from douche bag to hero.  He's quite good and look forward to him, and people who aren't generically good looking, in the youth crowd of actors getting more leads like this in bigger and better projects.  He manages to give us the pathos, comedy, and shear fear that this role requires, and sometimes in the same scene.  ""See look, creepy vampire hand!"", is one of his funniest lines and silliest and he manages it without looking or sounding stupid.

Imogen Poots his quite effective in the film too, despite her having the most underwritten role.  She comes off not like a bimbo but as an average teenage girl, who just happens to be impossibly gorgeous.  I would like to see her in meatier roles with more to do beyond being the hero's reason for going into the dragon's lair after being kidnapped.

Now onto Evil Ed, the most popular character from the first film.  Now Stephen Geoffreys isn't a great actor, but he imbued that part with something totally original and unexpected of the genre at the time.  I take nothing from his role in that film.  He was great.  Hell, the concept of a painfully nerdy kid becoming a new all powerful vampire is still a great quirky concept that no one has really done since or before.  In this we get Mintz-Plasse playing basically a toned down version of McLovin.  But it's more than that.  He manages to play the hurt of losing his best friend to the status of high school realistically, and his ultimate revenge manages to be harrowing, funny, and silly all in great effect.  Is he as memorable as Geoffreys in the original?  No, not even close, but he pulls off the roles requirements and I'd imagine for people who haven't seen the original, or don't even know that this is a remake, his character will hold some surprises for them.  The only thing I really want to complain about when it comes to this character and his role in the plot involves his demise by Jerry.  I don't mind that it happens WAAAAAY earlier in this film, but rather how the drama plays out.  In the original it's quite emotional how Jerry pulls Ed into his arms promising a world where no one will ever pick on him again, and quite scary how Jerry chases him in the alley.  In this film, while Jerry' dialogue is similar, it just doesn't have the same impact and pathos.  It's there but not quite as good.

Toni Collette shows up in the film as Charlie's mom.  Her part has been beefed up from the previous film.  I really liked her and her role as the stakes for Charlie gets raised.  People accuse roles like this being thankless when big name and very talented actors like Colette take them, but I disagree.  She performs a function and does it really well.  Is the part small, and not very deep?  Yup, but it feels layered and you care about her almost instantly because of Colette.  Here's a good litmus test, if a lesser actress had played the 'thankless' role of Mrs. Brewster how would the film have turned out?  This isn't Shakespeare but it should be take seriously regardless and the final film benefits from it in totality.

Now there is one thing that disappointed me about this remake; the vampires don't really have monster transformations.  In the original film Steve Johnson's make up effects for the vampires various monsterous visages were quite impressive if totally over done by the decade's end.  Jerry turns into a monsterous bat, Ed turns into a wolf, etc.  In this film the vampires do get ugly when they get mad, but it's just a slight bat-like visage and some major gnarly claws.  It was done by Howard Berger of KNB effects and the make ups are quite good, but they are enhanced with digial effects, very good digital effects by the way.  When Jerry goes full blown monster for the closing moments of the film it is mostly CGI.  Sorry, guys, but for some reason when Amy's jaw grows large and filled with jagged teeth in the original it was done well by make up effects, but the remake need to be aided by CGI.  Why?  Is it more effective?  Not really.  At the end of the day, digital or make up, I still know I'm looking at an effect.  I just admire make up effects more than CGI.  That's just me.

The basic plot points and reasons for this story are the same as the original but tweaked, rearranged and give different back stories.  This is what I think remakes should do.  Make a good films for the virgins of the franchise but also surprise, hopefully pleasantly, the old fans.  This film does that in spades.  I can't really reveal what those tweaks and twists that might surprise old school fans are due to them being major spoilers.  I will say, without too much detail, that Jerry's ultimate plan has more to do with than just drinking blood for survival.  It's a great twist to the vampire lore, and leaves room for a third act surprise that had me squirming and widening my eyes with glee.  Peter Vincent gets the same treatment, although his new twist is easily figured out, at least to me, but it was very satisfying and gave him a logic of more dramatic weight that the first film really didn't need or have.  It works.

I know my horror nerd membership card may get revoked, but I really loved this remake.  No, not more than the original, but as close to it as possible for a story I've seen once told already.  This is how remakes should be done in my estimation.  Don't recreate the wheel, but rather tweak it and turn it down a different road to get to the same end.  See this movie, new or old fan, you are going to get something out of it.  If you're a fanboy and just can't deal with anything about your original film being changed or tweaked, just avoid it and save yourself the headache and us your bitching rants.

PS: I saw this is in 2D.  I really don't care about 3D and the low box office returns for 3D films is diminishing(just like it did in the 50's and in the 80') its appeal to studios, so I imagine I will have to deal with having to go to different theaters just to see a damn movie in glorious 2D much less in the future.  It's a horror film, set mostly at night, mostly in dark areas, so why would one want to make it muddier and darker by slipping on 3D glasses?  I wouldn't and don't.  Although, this film does have actual 3D intended shots, and was shot in actual 3D, I just didn't see the point of the gimmick beyond taking the audience out of the film which was a semi-serious horror film.  Plus, some of the shots that are big 3D shots really screw up the flow of the edit and manage to take you out of the movie even if you're watching it in 2D.  One that sticks out is a shot of a vampire monster hand coming through the bottom of a car.  The shot is held to long obviously for 3D effect.  Things are flung at the camera several times too, but there's really no good reason this straight horror film is done in 3D.",1313884800,104,12170,4.498860009119927
4221942,5,B003Y5H5FG,"""Fright Night"" is great! This is how the story goes: Senior Charley Brewster finally has it all -- he's running with the popular crowd and dating the hottest girl in high school. In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed. But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right -- and everyone, including Charley's mom, doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charley comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charley has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself.

The cast led by Anton Yelchin (as Charley Brewster) & Colin Farrell (as Jerry) is great. The directing by Craig Gillespie is great. The story by Tom Holland (based on his original 1985 ""Fright Night"") & the screenplay by Marti Noxon is great.

The music by Ramin Djawadi is great. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is great. The film editing by Tatiana S. Riegel is great. The casting by Allison Jones is great. The production design by Richard Bridgland is great. The art direction by Randy Moore is great. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is great. The costume design by Susan Matheson is great. The make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is great.

This is another great horror remake that is just as great as its original. This is a fun, fast-paced and entertaining ride that keeps your heart racing and your heart thinking at the same time. This is a great vampire film. Colin Farrell is great as Jerry.",1313798400,2,1628,4.745583038869258
4221943,5,B003Y5H5FG,"Let me start out by saying that I was a huge fan of the original, great, entertaining Fright Night. So, when I heard this was being made I was pumped. This is a great film and one to catch in 3D. Colin Farrel goes a fantastic job as Jerry Dandridge and the rest of the cast was great as well. I think this is one not to miss 5/5.",1313798400,2,329,3.782608695652174
4221944,5,B003Y5H5FG,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night/dp/0767817664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night</a>&nbsp;is my favorite vampire movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time. I wasn't sure if a reboot had any chance to work. After seeing it today, I have to admit that I am very impressed overall.

Colin Farrell's Jerry Dandridge was much more menacing than expected. Although we do find out more about this Jerry than Chris Sarandon's, Colin's isn't suave and has no humanity - he's just a cold killer.

Charley Brewster, his mother, Amy and Evil Ed (now Lee instead of Thompson) are better developed and more believable in the 2011 version.

David Tennant's performance as Peter Vincent is a highlight of the film. His knowledge of vampires and collection of artifacts and weapons is pretty substantial. My only disappointment with this Peter Vincent is that he didn't find his faith, which was what the original was all about to me.

The story has been brought out of the 80s, and hopefully will appeal to modern audiences who wouldn't appreciate the original like those of us who saw it in theaters.

Lots of suspense, and the action barely pauses once it starts. Of course, the special effects are much better than the original (really glad they kept the huge vampire mouths - they still creep me out!), and the 3-D was well-done and fun.

If I had a choice of which Jerry I'd rather live next to, it would definitely be Chris Sarandon's. He didn't hesitate to turn into mist or a bat, but had compassion and seemed like someone who'd be interesting to hang out with.

I'll definitely add this to my collection as soon as it's released, and am already looking forward to seeing it again. Plenty of opportunity for a sequel. Hopefully this time we'll get a Fright Night 2 worth watching.",1313798400,3,1836,5.019736842105263
4221945,5,B003Y5H5FG,"First, Great Casting!  David Tennant as Peter Vincent is inspired casting, as the decadent Las Vegas stage magician / vampire slayer. Seeing 'the Doctor' drop the F-Bomb(s) was a joy (although he was more Barty Crouch Jr. Meets Chris Angel as played by a Scottish Russell Brand, but brilliant!) Anton Yelchin (Star Trek)was reformed dweeb Charlie Brewster, playing the distracted would-be hero perfectly to type. Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) is good as Evil Ed, In this case Charlie's ex-sidekick now that Brewster is dating out of his league. Their classmates are disappearing, Ed is already wary of vampire goings-on and tries unsuccessfully to bring Charlie in on it.

 In the New Orleans papers they only got 2 stars, they (like some Amazon reviewers) clearly didn't get it... It was superbly done, perfect balance of tones, while being just enough of a tribute to the original ( in fact there's an obvious cameo ad well)  but totally it's own film. A modern statue to the genre, darkly funny, but with some intense moments like the kill room sequence & some realistically panicked car fleeing scenes.  Collin Farrell (Daredevil) played a perfect preator, without being campy, We opted not to see it in 3-D, I don't like the effect in dark movies, and Fright 'Night' , hello.",1313798400,3,1273,4.957746478873239
4221946,4,B003Y5H5FG,"Saw this last night in the theater. Don't let the fact that it's a remake scare you into not watching it (as most remakes are infamously horrid). Overall I found the movie entertaining and fun to watch. I LOVED the original Fright Night and it's sequel but it is so dated now it's hard to watch without cringing at the cheesy '80s hairdos, clothing, and lack of technology. I loved this new version because it poked fun at everything we take for granted today, everything that is silly about our society, and even gets in a few digs at the original movie with some well-placed tongue-in-cheek lines from the original.

The story line is different from the original but I liked the changes a lot. Colin Farrell makes a good, and pretty sexy, vamp! He plays the role of Jerry well and is very creepy. I don't like the fact that the writers kept the whole ""face-morphs-into-a-demon"" thingie, though. It's just weird and not very original (and definitely not sexy). Also, there wasn't as much romance in the film as there was in the original. In the original, the Amy character is the spitting image of Jerry's long-lost love so when he goes after her the story kind of makes more sense. In the new version Amy is all about Charlie. There's no portrait of her previous incarnation in Jerry's house and Jerry just goes after her to increase his ""tribe.""

From the trailer one got the sense that Jerry was really out to get Charlie in some way but the whole destruction of Charlie's life seems to be more incidental in the new film, like it could have been any high-school kid Jerry chose to pick on.

I have to say, I LOVED the new Peter Vincent! 1. Hot, with and without the ""Vincent persona."" 2. Not an old fogey like in the original (sorry Roddy McDowall). 3. Still makes the same change from coward to courageous as in the old version. Sigh. And tight leather pants do help! Mmm. The writers also gave Peter more of a reason to be a vampire hunter in this film but you almost don't connect him with the opening scene until the very end. The connection could have been made earlier. Also, no explanation as to why Jerry didn't kill Peter when Peter was younger. Weird.

I liked the actor chosen to play Charlie's buddy Ed/Evil but you don't really get to see him too much in this version of the story. The friends' back-story is fuller than in the original movie though and you really get a feeling that Ed wants revenge on Charlie for slighting him.

Special effects: Ok. Nothing spectacular except the fangs which, when not mega-demony looked exactly how I picture vampire fangs to be, sharp as all hell and retractable but not ginormous, kinda catlike. I did not see this in 3-D so take that into account.

Some silly continuity problems that made me go duh! 1. Midway through the film Charlie learns that these kinds of vampires make their nests underground, yet when he busts into Jerry's house for the final showdown, Charlie wastes all this time checking out the top two floors of the house before going down to the basement.... Burning that kind of daylight when you're hunting a vamp is kinda stupid. 2. Closer to the beginning of the film, Ed/Evil is being chased by Jerry and he decides to run UPSTAIRS to escape... sigh. When the heck are movie-writers going to stop using this daft ""go-upstairs-to-get-away-from-the-bad-guy"" routine. You would think the escapee would want to remain on the ground floor! Gah! And, Ed falls into a pool (a pool) and is cornered there by Jerry. Don't get me wrong, it makes for a pretty cool underwater bite scene, but you can't get out of a pool and run? God! It's not quicksand!

Car-chase scene: kinda lame. I think it would have been better in 3-D. In the original, Jerry could fly, so why the heck do they have him chasing Charlie and friends in a truck this time?

I do love how they made Jerry just randomly go around biting all of Charlie's friends though. He doesn't even bother to cover up some of his kills. His inhumanity rally gives him the jollies and makes his character much more slick and vampire-like. He acts like a true predator. The Jerry in the original film was more cautious and had a Renfield-like buddy to help him out during the day. I'm not sure why this helper character was done away with in this film but I think it was a pretty good choice. He always seemed extraneous in the original.

So, not the best vampire film ever made but highly entertaining and worth going to see in the theater. I'm hoping they make a sequel like they did with the original. That was a very sexy film and has a lot of potential as a remake.",1313798400,,4592,4.503001200480192
4221947,1,B003Y5H5FG,"Where to begin?

The writer made the insult that she felt Horror movie hosts are irrelevant and that no one today would understand what one is. This both insults the audience and people like Elvira and the cast of MST3K. I guess she never heard of Nostalgia Critic, Rifftrax or Mystery science Theater 3000. Another insult to the audience.  This also diminishes the portrayal by the late, great, Roddy McDowall. She thinks people today would find Charley more relatable as a social climbing tool who abandons friends for popularity. Why?

  The script has the character Ed make a lame joke about sexuality.

 The script calls everything interesting (Peter's apartment) geeky
  At ComicCon,  in front of Chris Sarandon (original Jerry Dandridge in 1985) the director of the remake admits he can't remember the plot of the original. He viewed this as a ""good thing"" because it meant he could go in fresh. This shows lack of respect for Tom Holland's film and original story.  Author D.L. Warner called this unprofessional.
  The director of this remake couldn't recall the plot but said he remembered having nightmares from the movie as a child. He wasn't a child when the original was made. I was 3 when the movie was made and I'm almost 20 years younger than this director. This implies he's mistaking Fright Night for another movie made in the 60s and has no real recollection of it at all. I felt bad for Chris Sarandon, it was like they slapped him in front of an audience.

Peter Vincent's now and unrepentant alcoholic who makes a joke about being on the ""day wagon""  near the end of the script, and only works up the courage to help drunk.  They forgot (or don't know) he was originally a nod to Peter Cushing and Peter Vincent. There is no growth for Peter Vincent.

Nearly all the effects are bad CGI. Amy doesn't flinch when the windshield is smashed in front of her face. She just screams on cue.

 There are no nods to classic Hammer movies, as was the purpose of the original.

I like the Vampires of Anne Rice, Bram Stoker, Dan Curtis, Richard Matheson and Let the Right one In. They were all different.  They weren't made boring, contrived, over-used serial killers!

1985 Jerry enjoyed the hunt with cat-like instincts but there was still a human side. He tried to get Charley to look the other way. He grieved for a lost love.  Yet no humanity in this remake.  Ironic that he lost many of his powers and yet he's now more inhuman. In the remake he's a two dimensional serial killer, lacking depth or vampiric superiority.

Ed says (with lines written for the trailer) that Jerry's not brooding or love-sick. He's ""The shark from Jaws.""  I don't want Jaws!  I want vampires! People have forgotten vampires can be terrifying AND seductive. Hollywood has a polarized idea that vampires can only be mindless killing machines or vegetarian Twilight rejects.  Vampires are more frightening when they have hints of humanity because it makes you uncomfortable when they do something malicious. This Jerry has no humanity.
He lacks the powers of the original Jerry; the abilities to turn into a bat, mist, wolf, control weather, and enthrall . He's gained new limitations; not being able to be photographed, which doesn't even make sense because there are NO mirrors in digital cameras!
He's stripped of all the powers that made him mysterious. He no longer acts like a thousand-year-old predator. He's clumsy where a teenager can find the serial killer.  ow is it this vampire wasn't found by police?

Dandridge should be a vampire, not the typical ""Serial killer du jour."" He should be timeless. This guy feels...  dated. At one point Ed compliments how modern Jerry is.  He has his minion call him sir instead of master.  It's the first thing you're taught in creative writing class: Show, don't tell. Telling us he's modern is not the same as his BEING modern. And how does saying sir instead of master prove anyone is modern? The concept of masters still exist today.

In the original movie Jerry was a 1000-year-old being trying to survive and he felt like he might have been a thousand.  Now he just feels like some cliche serial killer.  If they wanted a serial killer why make him a vampire at all? What was the point of removing all his powers?  Rremakes are supposed to upgrade characters, not downgrade them.  It feels as` if the many explosions (which should be investigated) were meant to distract us from just how powerless these vampires are.

These vampires are like the Buffy vampires except with large mouths. She made this a Buffy Fright Night.  The original was a Dracula Fright Night. And it's just not the same. You strip powers and add more limitations and it takes away the mystique and the sense they are up against an ancient predator.

Why would Jerry risk so much exposure blowing Charlie's house like that? There is always an investigation when a residential home explodes, no matter the excuse.

Jerry in the original had Dracula's powers. This one is weak, can't even shape-shift or show up on camera.  New limits and less powers.  A vampire blowing a gas line and doing a car chase isn't a vampire.  It's a bad action movie villain you'd see against Arnohld.

It doesn't make sense that Jerry Dandridge doesn't show up on camera. It's a digital camera. There are no mirrors in digital cameras, and besides in the original Fright Night movies the vampires COULD show up on camera. In Fright Night 2 one actually took over Peter's show.

This should be ordinary people fighting ancient evil, not ordinary people fighting Jeffrey Dhomer...

 I like my monsters to have powers and not mimick cliche criminal archetypes because Hollywood thinks 'supernatural' isn't in anymore. Look what they did to Jason in the new Friday the 13th! He's just some insane hillbilly!",1313193600,22,5801,4.758758758758759

4222126,2,B003Y5H5FG,"Camp, chemistry, and more Chris Sarandon could have saved this re-make from mediocrity. But the 80s did that best.",1505692800,,114,5.052631578947368
4222127,4,B003Y5H5FG,"Relying far more on its outstanding cast than effects, this wasn't so great as a remake.  But remains very entertaining.  Lets be honest.  Nothing can compare to the original Fright Night (1985)!

Director Craig Gillespie (The Million Dollar Arm, The Finest Hours) wasn't known for horror, nor is he now (beyond this movie). But here he is making a contemporized remake of the very first contemporary vampire film ever: Fright Night (1985). In doing so, we relocate the Brewster family from northern California to Las Vegas, a city in which night owls and late shifts are the norm and children of the night need no camouflage.

Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin; Odd Thomas, Green Room) is a solid iteration of the original. He and is single mother (Toni Collette; Krampus, The Sixth Sense) find a handsome single man moving in next door and Charleys love-hungry girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots; 28 Weeks Later, Green Room) is the first to notice when his attention deviates away from her advances to the goings-on of his mysterious neighbor.  2011s Evil Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse; This is the End) offers context to two once-best friends who have now grown apart, but are now forced to face their local threat; whereas 1985s Evil Ed is clearly strange and is, to some degree, a friend or ex-friend (or something), yet neither his nickname nor his relationship with 80s-Charley are explained.

Our new Jerry (Colin Farrell; Total Recall, True Detective) is quite the change up from 1985s Chris Sarandon (The Resurrected, Fright Night). Sarandon was seductive, smooth, and offered every opportunity for his would-be protagonist victims to survive if they would just look the other way or accept whatever he offered; more forgiving and, perhaps, wise from his lengthened undead years.  But our fanged Farrell, while cagily charming, is typically more sleazy, crude and predatory before his patience is even testedcreating a more cat-and-mouse semi-slasher tone in lieu of occult mysticism.

Jerry also moves in with little baggage, and nary a ghoulish servant or subordinate vampire in sight.  I liked the bullying humor and domestic kinship Billy (Jonathan Stark; House II: The Second Story) brought to the original.  For me it was disappointing finding nothing analogous in role or tone. But a great contemporized remake victory is found in Peter Vincent (David Tennant; Doctor Who), who feels perfectly modeled after an occult-themed Criss Angel (Mind Freak) with a passion for vampirology and a sarcastic cowardice.

Overall, this remake makes decent use of parallels to the iconic scenes of the original, but really they pack none of the atmospheric punch. This is a great flick, a good horror movie, but it cant hold a candle to the original. That said, this remake clearly succeeds at giving us quality entertainment. Yes, Ive seen it more than once. Yes, I will watch it again. And yes, I bought it. But no, I won't watch it a fraction as often as the original.  Why?

We get a toothy maw transformation, some Jedi-jumping and wall-crawling, and all manner of blood gushes.  But wheres the rest?  Truth is, these CGI effects lack the practical old school charm of Amys gaping monstrous mouth. In fact, the effects generally don't impress much at all.  Thats not the films strength.  This remake succeeds on the merits of its cast, and everyone seems to do a fine job.  From Tenants quips to Charleys frantic desperation and Eds hammed up campy vampire shenanigans, I enjoyed this a lot despite the lack of any memorable effects.  It barely does any justice to writer/director Tom Hollands (Childs Play, The Temp, Thinner, Fright Night) original but that doesnt mean its not good.

Colin Farrell captures the essence of a vampire - incredibly alluring and erotic, but undeniably deadly, terrifying and ruthless. He can bite me anytime . . . Heh. As for Anton Yelchin, he shows exactly why he will be sorely missed. He is a wonderful actor, nuanced and believable even in the most unbelievable circumstances. The rest of the cast brings it up a notch from the original as well. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the original Fright Night. And Chris Sarandon was delicious as Jerry Dandrige.

The Vegas location makes for some nice Night Stalker parallels, which could have been pushed further and would have made a better film for sure.

There are still things which are sorta misses (not that the original does not have some of these as well, the casting for the ""love"" interest being one aspect which as not aged well.) The vampire is established as too powerful (he even has the power to warp space, just based on his tenant improvement work,) which creates a problem when it is time for the hero to dispatch it.
Also, having vampires turn into CG ash may work on Buffy, since it needs TV level violence, but there is no reason for an R rated feature film not to have Hammer style bloody deaths and disintegrations.
Having the hero say something, anything, would certainly help him out, but he remains silent ""I cannot talk about this"" for no reason whatsoever.
Even the homoerotic elements are not a big deal. They are there, but if anything they are less intrusive than the originals'.

4222943,2,B003Y5H5FG,"Some of you may recall a dark little gem of a movie from 1985 called Fright Night. Nearly as funny as it was scary, Fright Night took the basic scenario from Rear Window and turned it into a vampire tale. What if, the story proposed, you discovered that your new neighbor was one of the undead? Would anybody believe you? And what would you do when the vampire came after you? The result was one of the finest horror films of the 80s, and one of the best vampire films ever.

Fast forward to 2011 and the inevitable remake. Let's be clear, I don't inherently dislike remakes. I believe it is possible to take a good story and re-interpret it in a new and creative way. Occasionally, the remake is even better than the original.

This is not one of those occasions.

Directed by Craig Gillespie (who helmed the outstanding sleeper hit of 2007, Lars and the Real Girl), the 2011 Fright Night retains the basic plot from the original but changes things in all the wrong places. We still have a teenage boy who learns that his next door neighbor is a vampire, but everything else is a radical departure from the 1985 film. The original movie created a creepy, American Gothic sort of atmosphere and populated it with main characters that were easy to identify with. The filmmakers were obviously familiar with the old Hammer vampire classics and played off of the audience's undoubted familiarity with them as well. The humor was omnipresent but subtle and developed naturally from the dialogue and character interaction. And when it was time to be scary, it was scary indeed.

The new film doesn't bother trying to be very Gothic, American or otherwise. Set in Las Vegas, of all places, the movie has a grungy feel to it which is probably intentional, even though it undercuts the film's mood more than once. Informed not by Hammer horror but by Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Twilight, the remake tries to appeal to fans of those stories while still trying to duplicate what succeeded so well in the original. It doesn't work, anymore than baking a cherry pie with coconuts would. Blech.

More's the pity because the cast is absolutely outstanding: Anton Yelchin, David Tennant, Colin Farrell, Imogen Poots. Every one of them plays their part well, and for the most part they even seem to be enjoying themselves (especially Tennant, a renowned Shakespearean actor who here plays a very un-Shakespearean character). The thespian talent on hand should guarantee a good film, even with a bad script and questionable direction. But the cast's best efforts just aren't enough to overcome the weaknesses of the story itself.

The final product isn't particularly scary, and the humor, though incessant, is generally too vulgar and unimaginative to ever really be funny. Even the special effects, heavily reliant on CGI, are inferior to those of the original. There's no reason why Fright Night 2011 had to be a bad movie, especially not with the incredible cast. Ironically, in their desire to resurrect a genre classic, the filmmakers took Fright Night and drained it of everything that gave it life.",1438387200,3,3091,4.811676082862523

The movie isn't exceptionally well executed and Tennant's performance was the only one which ""wow""ed me. That said, it's still a well executed horror flick with good acting from a good cast. And being released during a time when Twilight's glitter-vampires were all the rage, it was refreshing for those of us over the age of 16 who appreciate a little horror with our undead. Definitely worth popping in the BluRay player for a fun night in. It just wasn't SPECTACULAR.",1438214400,2,647,4.6347826086956525

4222988,4,B003Y5H5FG,"Although I can live without scary movies and as a rule avoid them, Im happy I gave Fright Night a shot.  Previously, came across a photo captioned Colin Farrell is a sexy vampire.  Hard to believe in a sexy vampire, right?  However, this particular vampire becomes truly seductive as the movie goes on.  Lethally.

However, I also believe that vampires are seductive or alluring by necessity.  They have bold personalities and vampire Jerry is no exception having an air of self-assuredness about him and he is sometimes cruelly arrogant.

In scene #6, the Jerry Diaries, vampire Jerry and his prey Charley have a one-sided dialogue about women while Jerry attempts to get an invite into the Brewster residence.  Jerry has a macho, womanizing attitude and a demur that is obviously psychopathic.  Jerry tells Charley that women who look at him a certain way need to be managed, there is neglect in the Brewster residence that gives off a certain sent, Charleys girlfriend, Amy, is ripe and there must be a line of guys waiting to pluck that, and Jerry implies that Charley is not up to looking out for is mother and Amy while warning him that there a lot a bad people around.  Its a very creepy scene notwithstanding Jerry is a vampire staking out his next door neighbors as potential victims.  Later that night, Charley makes a 911 call when he hears a blood curdling scream from Doris who was at Jerrys house for beers that he got from Charley claiming he ran out of beers and a girl, who is a handful, was coming over.  When the cops respond to the emergency call, Jerry uses his macho, womanizing nature to get them to leave without even checking on Doris.  Charley observes Jerry talking to the two cops outside of the front door and saying Yeah, she screamed and having a good laugh over what Jerry and Doris were allegedly doing on their date.  Jerry and the cops exchange handshakes and they leave.  Charley is pissed off by his failed attempt to rescue Doris from Jerrys lair.

Jerry does seduce Amy in the club scene and just before Charley and company destroy him, Jerry tortures Charley by having Charley watch him make out with Amy, who is under his spell.

The plot is good and its carried out well.  Special effects are great.  The movie isn't only about how to kill vampires; there are rules vampires and potential victims apply that creates the interesting cat-and-mouse game.",1431648000,2,2393,4.681818181818182

4222990,3,B003Y5H5FG,"I do like the fact that the story was so different that there was very little to compare to the original. Other than the names and a few key moments that were more like nods to the 1985 film than mirror images there was little to go on with this film. The story was simple but smart, the characters were just a little too one dimensional and left the story feeling flat. It seemed that at pivotal moments when the characters should have been more animated they came off seeming unsure of who they were in relation to the story. Maybe the actors listened to all the hype or bad press buzzing around the net while filming Fright Night or maybe they just saw it as a paycheck. Either way the only character that seemed to care at all about her role in the film was Toni Collette as Ms. Brewster. She had a very limited role so that is saying something there. The characters I wanted to see really play out on screen was that of Peter Vincent and Jerry Dandrige. Those should have been the roles that pushed this film beyond re-animation and placed it into a reboot category. Instead they came off almost dead inside and pointless to the story-Like an after thought.

Now it pains me to say bad things about any film that is part of a genre I love but I really am slightly sad about this film being so under whelming. The effects seemed a little SyFy channel to me and at key moments when the scares could have really sold me on this film they seemed contrived. As if there was some check list off stage and the director just went through each kill and gore moment repetitiously then said okay, cut! The original had so much more wow and shock factor than this remake. Which I know you cant really compare the two stories because there was enough of a variation to keep this newer version individual except by today's standards and abilities in film making there is so much more that a film can utilize in order to scare the s*** out of us and this film just didn't do that.",1431216000,,1970,4.309973045822103

4223182,5,B003Y5H5FG,"Satan is the most seductive being in this dimension. So are most of his minions. Here is the story of one of them and the unlucky people who attempt to stop him. An upscale area gets a new addition that is attractive to the ladies but carries a deadly secret. One young person in the area finds out the newcomers secret and then must fight for his life and his soul. Murders begin occurring in the area and it does not take much to figure out who, or in this case what, is doing them. Former and most popular Doctor Who EVER, David Tennant, stars as Peter Vincent, a vampire slayer who is very reluctant to continue fighting. However, he has a change of heart and decides to help out the youngster, Charley Brewster, to fight the undead monster but it will not be simple. This is a remake of the classic from the 80's and it is just as good if not better. I like David Tennant as Peter Vincent a LOT more than the guy who played Vincent in the original.

What was so enjoyable about it was Roddy McDowell's hilarious performance as the TV horror movie host, Peter Vincent. What we get in this new version is Dr. Who alumni, David Tennant, as a foul- mouthed Las Vegas magician version of Peter Vincent - an obnoxious ""rock-star type"" ,who adorns himself in tight black leather and surrounds himself with articles of the occult. Although Colin Farrell is excellent as vampire Jerry Dandridge, and technically, the movie has some outstanding scenes, I can't recommend the film on the basis of the excessive foul language and the lack of ""clean"" humor, which makes this movie unviewable, in my opinion, to younger audiences. It's a shame that's so many contemporary screenwriters equate obscene language with humor.",1417132800,3,851,5.173913043478261

4223323,3,B003Y5H5FG,"Forget the 'Twilight' nonsense, with its groomed and pampered vampires who would rather wax philosophical about love and commitment; give me evil and nasty and predatory vamps, and--of course--over-the-top piranha yaps.  One can only imagine how much fun Colin Farrell had playing next-door night stalker Jerry in this amusing remake of FRIGHT NIGHT, the original being a cult favorite from the Eighties.  Colin gets to do it all, from pulling a gas line out of a yard to set it alight, to getting run over and dragged like an errant tumbleweed, to getting impaled by a metal sign.  If his agent didn't get a raise for finding this role for Farrell, it's a blasted injustice.  And on top of that, how can you beat wimpy Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a vampire nerd--a nerd who is his own worst enemy?  It all adds up to the sheer fun this version of FRIGHT NIGHT brings to the flat screen.

Okay, the story is moronic and contrived:  teenager Charley (a deadpanned Anton Yelchin) gets the creeps when Jerry moves next door, and weird things begin to happen--and women begin disappearing.  Constantly doubted by his single mom (Toni Collette is under-utilized here), Charley ultimately enlists the aid of famed paranormal expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant needs to eat); Peter has a room full of nasty anti-monster tools, and do they come in handy when it's time to take on Jerry and his gang of victims-turned-vamps. . .all to save Charley's girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots is under-utilized, too). The filmmakers possess infinite imagination, and it shows, from vampires exploding when sunlight finds them, to mouths morphing into a grimace that would make Jaws blush.  The story is predictable and inane, but come on, it's still fun to watch all the goo and carnage.  For those who enjoy a good chuckle, and never take the horror genre seriously, this remake of FRIGHT NIGHT is what the doctor ordered.

I will take my attention off him for one second to say that this movie had a plot that would normally be cheesy B movie material, but the actors in it bump it up to a higher level.  There is also a sense of humor  that gives the audience a good laughing break every once and a while without detracting from the drama and intensity of the movie.  The pace of the movie is pretty fast and it held my attention completely.  I can watch it again and again.
Ok back to Farrell; wow!  He is hot to begin with but this movie makes him hotter by ten fold.  You might want to turn the temperature down before you watch this.  Male or female doesn't matter.  Don't know how they did it.  Just movie magic I guess.

The movie is true to its predecessor.  The story is a horror movie, but it's also a bit of a comedy.  It has its share of blood, vampires and jumps at the right moments, but what  made it enjoyable were the one liners at just the right times.

Farrell is great as the main antagonist, but I really liked David Tennant, the guy who played Roddy McDowall's role of the vampire expert.  His character, and his wife, were funny in their interactions.  The Midori was a good touch too.

4223511,5,B003Y5H5FG,"(Tried to write this with as few spoilers as possible. I apologize if I failed.)

This is an excellent adaptation of the original 1985 version, while managing to avoid some of the clich&eacute;s that showed up in that movie. It does fall prey to some of the newer clich&eacute;s, of course, but the loss of his necromantic Renfield from the first movie script was a definite improvement. As was the removal of the whole ""reminding him of a woman he loved"" nonsense.

The characters are memorable and relatable. I got to marvel at Tennant's range in a way that I would never have expected, as I've only seen him in Doctor Who before this. (IF I'm honest, getting to see what else he could do was part of the draw for this movie.) I fell in love with the very geeky recasting of Ed - frequently referred to as ""Evil"" in the 1985 version. And Amy was - gasp, choke - actually fairly intelligent and insightful when it came to exactly what she wanted in her relationships.

The vampires are actually vampires. You see examples of super strength, hearing and such. There is no ""hiding"" of his capabilities from his victims or from people that actually knew he was a vampire.

And, the change from ""aging TV star"" to ""Vegas Magician Star"" was an excellent idea. Let's be honest, after all, not many TV shows are actually made in the cities that they are broadcast from. Widespread syndication is a wonderful thing in that it allows us to see and share comments on shows with people all over the country, but it ruined the plot from the first movie when it became the standard for even late-night television. (I'll not get into other syndication drawbacks. Very off topic.)

4223567,3,B003Y5H5FG,"I am not a fan of remakes, because rarely, if ever, do they do justice to the original film. That being said, I wasn't expecting anything out of the Fright Night remake, except for a cameo by Chris Sarandon. I was however pleasantly surprised, as the young cast was better than expected. For those who don't know the story, it is a classic vampire tale. Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager, whose life revolves around High School and his beautiful girlfriend. Everything is perfect until an old friend tells him that his new neighbor is a vampire. At first Charley doesn't believe him, but the more he watches, the more he realizes that something isn't right. Anton Yelchin opposes Colin Farrell, and while he might not have the name recognition, he easily outshines the veteran actor. Yelchin has a cult following among fans of teen movies, after strong performance in films like Charlie Bartlett and Middle of Nowhere. As with most teen idols, his popularity is not just about his looks, it comes from his smooth relaxed style of acting, that people can relate to. Yelchin's characters are always real and honest, the kind of guy audiences can easily relate to, and that's what makes him as good as he is. Yelchin has help in this film from an all-star cast that includes, Farrell, Toni Collete, Christopher Mintz-Plasse-Mclovin, Dave Franco, and of course the original vampire, Chris Sarandon. The combination of chemistry between new and veteran make for a truly powerful cast, that bring new life to this classic story.",1393545600,2,1542,4.8893129770992365

It was a talented ensemble to begin with-- Colin Farrell and Toni Collette in the same movie? And a vampire flick to boot? Great fun! It was delightful to see the entire cast put their own spin on each of the characters. Young Yelchin was adorable as Charlie Brewster and Ms Poots an enjoyable co-hort. Tennant was a terrific drunken mess and Farrell pretty smoldery, if that's a word. Fun movie- I mean, it's a vampire movie, so you know.

Colin Farrell's Jerry is charming on the surface, but once he has no more use for that facade, you'll find a misogynist, murderous monster lurks beneath.

The new story line is very imaginative and the acting was good but I have a problem with the Vampire fangs, they did not have Vampire fangs but instead they had a mouthful of out of place, crooked and way to many pointy teeth in their mouth, I'm sorry but that is not a Vampire, that is some kind of freaky monster thing.

Extra props to David Tennant for bringing his Whovian comedic timing to...well, a reincarnation of Spike, if you'd believe that. (Not in the undead way, just in the humor way.) Sure, the cinematography's occasionally too dark to see, but for once the 3D is appropriately used, mostly to beef up Buffy's original ""ashes"" effect for vampire deaths. Good stuff.",1383091200,3,693,4.552
4223726,4,B003Y5H5FG,"...to make it worthwhile.

The original ""Fright Night"" from 1985 was a fun horror film with a half-serious, half-campy vibe. Its strengths were a great story, an excellent (and hideous) vampire, Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent and an entertaining air. There was a quasi-remake in 2008 called ""Never Cry Werewolf"", which (obviously) traded the vampire for a werewolf; it was a quality remake with the variation of a female protagonist (Nina Dobrev) and Kevin Sorbo in the McDowall role.

This 2011 official remake features Colin Farrell as the vampire. It has the same plot, but there's enough variation in the details to make it a quality remake. Instead of the Los Angeles area (or an Eastern city in ""Never Cry Werewolf""), this one takes place in a small desert community outside Las Vegas (and was shot in Vegas and New Mexico). I can't say that Farrell is a better vampire than Chris Sarandon (or the werewolf in ""Never Cry Werewolf"", Peter Stebbings), but he's just as good in his own unique way, although the F/X aren't as good when the vampire morphs into its most hideous self.

Anton Yelchin shines as the teen who is astonished to discover that a vampire is living next door. Seriously, Yelchin is a surprisingly excellent protagonist. Toni Collette as his mother and Imogen Poots as his girlfriend offer strong support. These three take the material seriously and are contrasted by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes a campy approach, and Colin, who opts for lower camp like Sarandon in the original.

The weak point of the original was Amanda Bearse (""Marcie"" from Married With Children). Don't get me wrong, she was her typical fun, likable self, but she didn't cut it as a hot female protagonist (then again, maybe the filmmakers weren't shooting for that). Poots, Collette and Sandra Vergara as Ginger -- Peter Vincent's babe -- deliver the goods here. However, David Tennant isn't anywhere near as strong in the McDowell (or Sorbo) role. Why? Because Peter Vincent in the remake is just a sad alcoholic who's hiding out as a Vegas entertainer, trying to drown out his grief. Tennant's fine in this role, but the character, as-written, isn't as strong.

In any case, 2011's ""Fright Night"" is an entertaining horror flick. It's not actually scary due to the semi-goofiness, but it's very amusing and thrilling.

The film runs 106 minutes.

The language was unnecessary, but oh well, that was the only flaw.  Great job on the remake, was true to the original story but different enough to make it interesting.",1382659200,,291,4.2727272727272725

4223730,5,B003Y5H5FG,Great take on the original Fright Night movie. I think this movie is better than the first. The effects were very realistic.,1381968000,,124,4.681818181818182
4223731,5,B003Y5H5FG,"First, I must confess that I am as picky about my horror movies as I am about my sic-fi. I don't want gore just for the sake of it any more than I want special effects just because there's a big huge budget and the ""powers that be"" think they don't need a story if the effects can blow the roof off of the theater. I want my blood and guts in service of the story and served up to me in a context. I want character development and a plot that'll keep me on the edge of my seat. In short, I want substance and I want it all to be compelling because I get more than a little cranky when it's not. Jeepers Creepers had me so freaked out I had to watch it in the middle of the afternoon and even then I still knew I'd be jumpy as a cat for days and Victor Salvo (writer and director) made that movie with almost NO budget but clearly knew where and what to spend it on. Fright Night delivers on all levels and in a number of ways it exceeds my expectations.

The screenplay for Fright Night was written by Marti Noxon who's spent a lot of time working in conjunction with Joss Whedon so the storyline and dialogue are rock solid. And, as far as I'm concerned, the film was perfectly cast as well. Nothing makes me happier than watching a group of actors who are clearly having the time of their lives on a project and you can see evidence of that in the chemistry and performances of everyone involved. Furthermore, I love the respect the remake shows by giving a ""walk-on"" role to Chris Sarandon who played the vampire in the original. However, I really appreciate that this version has been updated and done so with both intelligence and humor. The original was a little more campy which worked well for it at that time but I honestly believe the remake is sassier and more satisfying.

The long and short of it is that Fright Night is a smart, witty, fierce piece of filmmaking and delivers a great bang for the bucks it asks you to put out. As I said in my title; it made me want to run right out and set myself on fire and how many movies can you really say that about?! Buy it and see for yourself. It's going to hold up well. The smart ones always do.",1381622400,,2154,4.126190476190477

4223766,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I hate remakes just as much as the next person because they rarely do the original film justice, but from reading the reviews about this one in particular, I'd say people need to lighten up.

The original is, for some people, one of the greatest horror flicks of the 80s, so the remake was up against some stiff competition. I personally have never seen the original, so I can't say. However, I enjoyed this rendition & felt it lived up to its expectations as a modern day chiller. It was suspenseful, hilarious at times, & tastefully done. I think all of the actors did a pretty good job in their portrayals. David Tennant (Dr. Who) was a pleasure to watch. And Colin Farrell was as well, for obvious reasons. I thought he was a fantastic vampire. Menacing, self-involved, & pure evil such as they are in historical works of fiction. Real vampires don't sparkle...

I think that the main problem fans of the original have is that there wasn't quite enough gore. Get over it. I don't think it's written anywhere that a movie requires carnage & gore to be thrilling. Bottom-line, if you're a fan of vampire flicks like I am, give this one a try & don't be so stuffy about it if you've seen the original. From what I understand, they're worlds apart & cant be compared anyway. And besides that, no remake will ever be exactly like the original. That's the point of remaking it.

4223812,2,B003Y5H5FG,"It is cliche but the original Fright Night (1985) is far superior. The remake isn't particularly scary or atmospheric and not all of the performances work. Fright Night is a dark vampire tale about a guy (Charley) who discovers his neighbor is a vampire. Colin Farrell's performance was good but we note many women like Chris Sarandon as well. The absolute worst character was Peter Vincent. David Tennant is miscast here and nowhere near as good as Roddy McDowall's performance. Peter Vincent, the vampire hunter, is reduced to a Vegas sideshow wearing a lot of fake makeup. Charley isn't nearly as charming here and his girlfriend is an absolute bag. Evil Ed wasn't the dedicated method actor from the original either. The movie isn't terrible but it grossed only half of its budget in the US which is always the kiss of death. The movie struggled to find its audience because it isn't scary enough for a horror movie nor does it have the charm of the original. The soundtrack and comedy don't quite blend the way they did in the 1985 version. I must admit horror-comedy is extremely hard to do but the original was rewarded with a Saturn Award for Best Horror. No notable awards were connected to the remake. The Blu-ray picture quality is average but the audio is very good. There is 26 minutes of total bonus content. The second disc is a DVD copy.

4223982,3,B003Y5H5FG,"Fright Night is an okay vampire move.  Truthfully, I never found vampires the least bit frightening- walking around in the dark and sneakily biting people on the neck isn't really scary to me.  It's basically about a teenage boy and his girlfriend constantly running from a much bigger relentless vampire.

The good news is that there's a couple segments in Fright Night that are actually really good- the one where the victim, his girlfriend and mother attempt to drive away from the vicious pursuit of the vampire but constantly find themselves struggling to do so due to a sudden speed increase of the vampire who's able to catch up to the vehicle in time to wreak havoc.  I never realized vampires possessed such speed.  Anyway I loved this scene a lot.  I also like the one near the end when the girlfriend opens her mouth abnormally wide preparing to bite down on her boyfriend's face.  This scene is going to give me nightmares!  And I suppose the scene with the teenage boy catching himself on fire and being slammed around by the vampire inside a dark room is pretty suspenseful.

I was unaware that vampires need an invitation to enter homes- this is a new piece of information I wasn't aware of.  Unless this aspect is just an exclusive pertaining to *this* particular vampire film.  Also, the amount of blood from all the neck bites is relatively frequent.  I admire it.

Much of the storytelling is unforgivably bland and boring, especially the entire first half.  Talking, talking, talking.  It closely resembles a teenage drama.  I was contemplating switching it over but ultimately decided to stick with it.  I'm sort of glad I did, however.  The second half is an improvement.  I guess if you're a fan of vampire movies, well, you'll watch this remake of Fright Night regardless what I or anyone else says, but for those of you not sure if vampires will satisfy a quick horror fix?

Wow!  There are so many things I disliked about this movie I don't really know where to begin.

The movie just jumps in with little story, or character development.  The diologue is lame with ridiculous, unnecessary, sexual references every other line.  The neighborhood setting is boring, with cookie cutter houses.  The plot has holes big enough to drive a fleet of trucks through.  Young kids are missing and the cops only show up briefly in one scene.  Come on!  Evil Ed, Peter Vincent, and even Charlie Brewster are horribly written characters.  Jerry Dandridge never met a neck he didn't like.  I mean, he could have just brutally killed some of his enemies, not sucked every single one.  Stupid!  I only liked two things about this movie: Colin Farrell, and the cameo with Chris Sarandon.  Farrell plays the villan well, even with his lousy diologue, and really projects menace and evil.  It was also good to see Chris Sarandon again, even if his scene was mediocre.

Both the original Fright Night, and the sequel Fright Night 2, are much better movies.  I don't know what is happening to Hollywood these days.  What ever happened to quality writing, and telling an interesting story?  I know that the horror genre is not exactly Shakespeare, but there is a suck limit for me.  No pun intended.  This movie pretty much reached it, and I'm sorry I bought it.",1365811200,4,1394,4.7974683544303796
4223987,4,B003Y5H5FG,"The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
As for the film itself:  This remake wasn't as good as the 80s version.  The flow of the movie seemed a bit rushed.  I thought Anton Yelchin did a great job as Charley.  Colin Farrell didn't seem all that invested in his character Jerry.  Definitely not the intimidating presence of Chris Sarandon from the original.
The transformation of Peter Vincent from campy to show-off Criss Angel wanna-be left me conflicted.  While I adore David Tennant in anything, and omg he's so sexy with eyeliner and a goatee, there was really no background on this character, no real connection between him and Charley.  In the original, Charley watched Peter's show all the time and had a real reason to seek him out when dealing with the vampire.
Overall, the movie was decent light entertainment and a welcome addition to my vampire flick collection, but I probably won't re-watch it as much as the original (except to drool over David Tennant, haha).",1365724800,2,987,4.839285714285714

4224062,4,B003Y5H5FG,"I have a confession to make, which will probably get me stoned by an angry mob: I never really liked the original ""Fright Night.""

Now, I'm not saying that I hated it or that it was bad, but its campy style just didn't appeal to me. So perhaps it's not surprising that -- without nostalgia goggles -- I found myself thoroughly enjoying the remake that eventually got made. And a lot of that is due to Colin Farrell's brilliant performance as a laid-back, casually creepy vampire-next-door.

Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is understandably annoyed when his estranged friend ""Evil"" Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) claims that his new neighbor Jerry (Farrell) is a vampire. Then Ed vanishes, and Charley discovers -- by breaking into Jerry's basement -- that his new neighbor is indeed a vampire. Unfortunately, Jerry also knows that Charley knows that he's a vampire.

Who can Charlie turn to for help? Why, Doctor Who! No, seriously. David Tennant is in this movie as a leather-clad, foul-mouthed Vegas stage magician who ALSO happens to be a vampire expert. But when Jerry destroys his home and kidnaps his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots), Charley decides to take the fight to the vampire.

Colin Farrell is a big part of what makes ""Fright Night"" a good movie -- he acts mellow and laid-back all the time, often chuckling to himself as if the humans' struggles are just an amusement to him. But he never descends into camp cheese. Even ordinary, un-vampirey dialogue is somehow underlaid with menace when he speaks it (""Catch you later!"") -- how often do you see a vampire who can sound scary just asking for beer?

It's also really nice to see vampires that aren't misunderstood sad-eyed woobies who just need love. These vampires are vicious, malevolent and apparently possessed by an evil force -- the only moment when you feel sorry for them is when they briefly revert back to their human minds.

In fact, the movie actually reminds me a bit of the classic ""Dracula"" -- you've got Evil Ed as Lucy, Jerry as Dracula, Amy as Mina, Vincent as Van Helsing and Charley as a composite of all the other male characters. There's lots of tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Don't do anything I wouldn't do. That doesn't narrow it down. That's like, mini-golf and sushi"") and some bloodily hilarious moments (the battle between Evil Ed and Charley).

Biggest problem: the CGI for the vampire faces is pretty horrible.

None of the rest of the cast are QUITE as brilliant as Farrell, but they are all pretty good -- Yelchin is pretty convincing as an ex-nerd who is now trying to be non-""dweeby"" enough for his hot girlfriend, and Mintz-Plasse gives a deliciously warped performance as Evil Ed (who seems to have a bit of a crush on Charley). Toni Colette and Poots are also quite good, although Colette's character seems kind of superfluous.

And David Tennant... oh, David Tennant. He completely steals the scene whenever he's onscreen, cussing up a storm and slouching around in very tight leather pants. Not only is he sexy, but he's uproariously funny (""Midori me!"").

Normally remakes annoy me, but the remake of ""Fright Night"" ended up being one of the better vampire movies I've seen -- bloody, funny and weird.",1363132800,,3208,4.848263254113346

Now, Charley must enlist the help of famed vampire expert Peter Vincent to track down the fanged menace before he can sink his teeth into the rest of the neighborhood! FRIGHT NIGHT returns to the big screen in the 2011 remake, which unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Unlike Tom Holland's 1980's cult classic, which modernized the vampire mythos while paying homage to the films of the 50's and 60's, the only things this new version seems concerned about is looking cool and selling copies of the soundtrack. The plot has been slightly restructured in the first half to provide enough surprises for returning audiences as to keep things fresh, but the unnecessary escalation of action and computerized effects leads to a major let down in the second half. Careless screenwriting also leaves us with countless questions, since there do not appear to be any consequences for any of the characters' actions (particularly when no one can be bothered to investigate Charley's house fire or how and why he arrived at the hospital in a car that was stolen from a dead man). Filmmakers Craig Gillespie and Marti Noxon appear to have no interest in telling a convincing story or building suspense, and instead focus on being teen-edgy and hip. Colin Farrell hams it up in another over-the-top performance as Jerry the vampire, though he does fit the part of the handsome and seductive stud next door.

FRIGHT NIGHT is to the original what DISTURBIA is to REAR WINDOW: a trite, soulless retelling of the same old story used to capitalize on the teen dollar. Where the original is revered by fans, this version will quickly be forgotten.

4224136,3,B003Y5H5FG,"For those who remember it, Tom Holland's 1985 vampire cult classic ""Fright Night"" is truly something special. Like most beloved cinematic nuggets, a remake was only a matter of time. Enter Craig Gillespie's ""Fright Night,"" a modern update of a story that encapsulated an era of horror movies, recalling a time when movie monsters were as much fun as they were frightening.  Boasting a solid cast with the likes of Anton Yelchin, David Tennant, Toni Collette, Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse and Colin Farrell, this remake starts off with the best of intentions, even if its execution leaves a little something to be desired.

Built on the basic framework of Holland's original story, the details of this ""Fright Night"" are pretty familiar. Likeable yet slightly nerdy Charley Brewster (Yelchin) lives in the vanilla landscape of the suburbs (this time in the Las Vegas desert) with his single mother (Collette). Trouble comes to town when his neighbor, the charming Jerry Dandridge (Farrell), turns out to be a blood-thirsty vampire. In an effort to keep his mother -- as well as his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Imogen Poots) and his jaded former best bud ""Evil"" Ed (McLovin) -- out of danger, he teams up with washed-up vampire hunter/entertainer Peter Vincent (Tennant) and sets his sights on breaking into Jerry's bachelor pad and crashing his late-night party.

Similar to 2011's ""The Thing"" prequel/remake, this incarnation of ""Fright Night"" seems to have most of the ingredients for a good time in place, but unfortunately suffers from a crippling feeling that this has been done already, only much better (admittedly a problem with most remakes). Even though this particular remake distances itself a bit from the original in certain aspects, it still hits the same basic beats as the original, which sucks a lot of the would-be intensity out of the room. Also, like the aforementioned ""Thing,"" this re-do boasts an awful lot of bad CGI blood and guts that may very well have looked fine in 3D, but which doesn't serve the film very well. On the upside, all the players on hand are game and the film moves at a relatively easy pace that builds its characters as it gives way to the obligatory chase scenes. There's also a cameo midway through the film that fans of the original film will relish. All the right components are in place for this film to be one of the least offensive (and, in turn, better) remakes in recent memory (and really, it is) but it doesn't quite fire on all cylinders, making for a film that works on the surface, but ultimately isn't a patch on its source material.

In the end, ""Fright Night"" is a wholly unnecessary yet admittedly entertaining remake. When one thinks of modern remakes, there are worse efforts that come to mind. Forgiven its flaws, this re-telling of a true cult classic gets the job done with minimal damage. Those who consider the original to be sacred would be best advised to steer clear, but those seeking a fun vampire romp minus the glitter could do much worse. If nothing else, it will inspire anyone who watches it to dust off a copy of the 1985 original and give it a spin (some for the hundredth time, many for the first), and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.",1358035200,,3232,4.839059674502712

- acting was not great - especially in the beginning
- sound was not good
- 3D was awful - a few scenes were good, but only lasted a few seconds.

- story was good (should be for a remake!)

Yet this new addition to it kept alittle bit of the original campy tone to the movie yet wasn't so over the top that it was stupid. And for one moment we got away from the good vampire and saw what a vampire is meant to be. It was fun and a overall good horror movie. I don't get why people think that the original was so great. It was sort of stupid. I love campy horror movies as much as the next person but I don't like stupid. I really enjoyed this and it was really fun considering that movies today are overly dramatic and take themselves way to serious. I'll definitely be adding this one to my collection.,1349740800,,743,4.23943661971831

4224236,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I don't normally watch or, if I do watch, enjoy remakes of classic 80's movies.  I was a teenager in the 80's and watched most of the 80's classics either at the movie theater on dates, at the drive-in with six of my friends crammed in the car, or on the new fangled VHS video tapes.  Life was good back then... Ahem anyway, I dislike most remakes because they just plunk hot, new starlets (male and female) into my beloved old movie and bring nothing new to the role or story line.  My thinking has always been why watch the remake when I can watch the original?

I loved the first Fright Night.  It has remained in my top 5 movies of all time for many years.  Vampires were still scary and not all sparkly and brooding back then.  So it was with great trepidation that I watched this remake.  Man I am so glad I did!

*SPOILERS * SPOILERS * SPOILERS *

The new movie pays homage to the first movie by keeping everyone's name the same, keeping many of the key plot points, and using many of the same scenes from the first movie.  The new movie includes current events and uses them to explain some plot points which were lacking in the first movie.  For example:

-When people start disappearing in the neighborhood, the neighbors just assume the people lost their house due to the economy and left town.

-To explain why Jerry (a vampire named Jerry!) is not seen during the day and why his windows are blacked out, the writers set the story in Vegas so he just tells anyone who asks that he works on the strip at night and sleeps all day.  Brilliant!

-The missing prostitute from the first movie is now a neighbor who is a stripper.  Lots of strippers in Vegas and making her the missing person makes much more sense as to why Charlie goes into Jerry's house looking for her.

-Fright Night is no longer a campy local T.V. show.  Now it's a campy Las Vegas ""magic show"" ala Chris Angel.

This remake has the perfect balance of the original plot and enough new scenes to keep it fresh and interesting.  Also LOVED the cameo by the original Jerry.  This is how it's suppose to remakes are suppose to be done.",1348358400,,2110,4.329081632653061

4224241,4,B003Y5H5FG,"I was a fan of the original 1985 Fright Night with Roddy McDowall. Before watching this version, I had my family watch the original (It's just a thing I have my kids do). I was worried they'd make fun of the oldness (for lack of a better word), but they quite enjoyed it.

So now on to this new release. Though it kept to a similar basic format, it was a departure from the original. Matter-of-fact, the only thing in common was the plot - Vampire moves in next door and no one believes the boy next door. My family was looking for some of the characteristics that made the old version what it was; in particular, the goofiness of the friend - Evil Ed. He was nowhere to be found. However, in the new version Ed is just as unique and acceptably played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Go Mc Lovin!).

After you get beyond the differences, you come to realize that this new version of Fright Night is so well done that you no longer care. My son-in-law can be very critical of movies. You know the type... ""That's 80 minutes of my life I'll never get back"", and yet even he admitted it was a ""darn"" good movie.

Charlie was such a wuss and a douche bag that I was actually rooting for Jerry this time around!  Colin Farrell actually makes a great villian, just to bad the rest of the cast blows!  If your looking for a good vampire flick, look elsewhere because this isn't it.

4224281,3,B003Y5H5FG,"Fright Night (2011) is a remake of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1985-classic/dp/0767817664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1985 classic</a>&nbsp;starring Roddy McDowall, Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse. It's the story of a young man with a vampire living next door who recruits a fictitious vampire slayer to rid himself and his friends of the problem.

As remakes go, this one if pretty fair, maintaining interest throughout the film for the most part. A-list actor Colin Farrell somehow agreed to play the lead (the vampire) in this B movie and does well with his part. Taking liberal cues from Christian Bale's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Psycho/dp/B002PA8Q1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Psycho</a>, Farrell tries to be horrific, campy and psychological in his role with lots of shifting eye stunts and half-actions. He's fairly believable (as believable as one can be playing a vampire) and generally carries his part well. While probably not as effective as Sarandon from the 1985 version, Farrell nonetheless carries the film.

The rest of the cast -- Anton Yelcher as Charlie Brewster, the neighbor; Toni Collette as his mom, Jane; and David Tennant who recreates McDowall's role as the vampire slayer -- are not nearly as good. Yelcher emotes a lot of the time, Collette seems disaffected as mom, and Tennant is way over the top playing a Las Vegas entertainer/vmapire expert. None of the three are particularly gripping in comparison to the 1985 film. Charlie lacks the naivete Ragsdale brought to the part and no actor will ever portray the Vincent character with the self-doubt, charm and camp the late McDowall brought. Also, Chris Sarandon, so effective as the 1985 vampire, plays a small, inconsequential role.

With what is typical for horror films in the new century -- too much gore, somewhat disbelievable computer-generated graphics, and action substituting for performance -- there's little question the 2011 version is inferior to the 1985 film. Still, there aren't many vampire movies released these days, even in our copycat epoch, so any new vampire movie is worth seeing for fans of the horror genre. While this movie won't sway the general moviegoer to rent or own it, any horror acolyte should give it a look.",1345766400,,2379,5.695774647887324

Man.... Am I sick of remakes. Arthur, The Thing, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Conan the Barbarian (With NO Arnold)!!! So please forgive me when I wasn't that thrilled to see a remake of yet another 80's classic this time starring McLovin. The problem though was that this remake was actually a blast from beginning to end. Both Colin Farrell and McLovin were great! I couldn't believe I made it through the movie let alone enjoyed it. So get ready for some entertaining cinema.

So to begin, the architecture remains the same from the original Fright Night. But has been updated with some newer special effects, story and more relevant comedy. Some characters were also tweaked a bit for a more 2010ish vibe. None of these changes are bad or annoying and some actually improve certain parts. It had a great blend of the right amounts of comedy and horror and didn't really go overboard with either. Not going to bother going into the plot as I'm hoping by now most of you have seen the original. So this isn't your usual remake that has been coming down the pike. A four to five star remake in my opinion (marked it  four, but really close to giving five as well). So give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

It is not a strict remake, the movie has similar characters to the first movie but it actually is almost as good as the original but in a different way. It is much more of a straight up ""bad vampire"" movie, with Colin Farrell being about as un-sparkly as it is possible to be.

It's hard to beat Roddy McDowell as Peter Vincent but David Tennant does a good job of bringing the character into the 21st century and I wish there would have been more of him in the movie. The same with Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Ed. This kid is great in everything he plays.

Also, a big thumbs up for the cameo by Chris Sarandon, I love it when they use original stars in the new movies.

This new version is an awful, anemic bastardization of the near-perfect original. It's soulless Hollywood trash with none of the flavor or fun, all the life has been squeezed out leaving just another generic teen horror movie no one will remember. And Instead of nerds being the heroes like in the original, we get beautiful 90210-type people saving the day (of course). Worse, nerds in this movie are treated like worthless losers to be cast aside in order to get ahead in life. Gone are the homages to classic vampire movies and TV horror hosts, replaced by soulless Las Vegas D-bag magicians.

Is the new Fright Night unwatchable? No, it's just not very good, like almost everything coming out of Hollywood these days. Even the special effects suck, being really lame CGI. The FX were a million times scarier and gorier in the 80s version!

Sometimes comical(esp the scene where David tennant complained about the leather pants chafing his crotch and esp in the bloopers where he says there's pus on it and how it doesn't look normal,which makes everyone laugh and flub the scene)David Tennant and Colin Farrell are definitely ones to watch.

I simply love the original with Chris Sarandon, the totally most handsome vampire ever.  I liked all of the original cast members as well, straight down to Charlie Brewster's Mom.

This remake with Colin Farrell was more sinister and evil in this film.  It was quite dark and a little humorous.  He was more of a rugged, brutal, killer.  It  didn't appear that there was a love interest in this movie for him.  Just kill, kill, and more kill.  Motivation was, ""I need Blood to Survive and I want it Now"".

I wasn't too fond of Evil.  His friendship with Charlie seemed a little strained.  I felt that Charlie was trying to do something different with his life, which didn't include Evil.  Evil seemed to resent Charlie and his new friends.  The new Peter Vincent was weird and I guess added a more modern feel to the character.  They even included more interaction with Charlie's Mom.  Amy still loved Charlie, but I found her a little boring.  She was not as perky as the original Amy for me.  Though Jerry went after Amy, their connection was different from the original movie.

Though I did not expect this movie to be as the original, I did not like some of the story line as much.  Though it showed a few of the additions from the first movie a little differently, it just did not flow as smoothly for me.  It was a little rugged on some of the edges.

4224319,1,B003Y5H5FG,"Fright Night in the 80s was and is one of my alltime favorite movies.  In this I expected something similar to the original.  There was nothing except the names of the people in the movie.  Chris Sarandon does a cameo appearance and I was shocked to see that he would even grace such a poor movie.  In the original, Chris Sarandon's Jerry Dandridge was calm, collected, stunningly sexy, witty, and just brilliant.  In this one, Collin Ferrell is sexy and that's about it.  He also comes off as some little punky jerk, not a 400-year-old vampire.  He seems to be more into porn instead of the sexiness that in everything I have seen and read usually accompanies vampires.  I was gravely disappointed in this.  It needed its own title, because to me this was not a remake.  There was nothing similar.  Peter Vincent in this one was fun and cool unlike the scared, older Peter Vincent in the first one.  In fact, the actor playing Peter Vincent in this one was the saving factor for this movie keeping it from being a total disaster.  If you read all my reviews, I usually only provide a review if it is really good, but this one was so disappointing that I felt I should provide my input in the midst of all the people who have not seen the original.  The original has a storyline... and it's awesome.  This one doesn't even make a lot of sense and the story doesn't even seem to go anywhere.  I think also they are trying so hard to ""modernize"" it that they lose sight of what a vampire story is all about.  I'm glad I borrowed this because I would have been sick to have put out money for this movie.  I would not recommend this to anyone who loved the original.

One of the biggest changes is a much younger Peter Vincent, he is a modern day celeb male diva(think of Russel Brand charactors) I actually quite liked this change, this movie is good enough to stand alone to the newer generation or sit right next to your copy of the original, it is entertaining, refreshing and fun and does justice to the original.
It doesn't over use the 3D effect and there for has more impact when put to full effect used to make you jump, and in my opinion the vampire exploding in sunlight in 3d is the best death scene I have seen in the last year, truely an awesome moment.
I really would have liked to have given the rating of 3 and a half stars",1333756800,,894,4.173410404624278
4224363,1,B003Y5H5FG,"Saw Fright Night (2011) on Amazon Instant Video on Demand.
Rated ""R"". Running Time: 1 hour, 45 mins.

 We are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Peter Vincent (David Tennant) is being advertised on television performing his shows at the Hard Rock Casino. The house appears to be quiet with the dog walking around.
  Suddenly a teenage boy, Adam (Will Denton), is being thrown out the bedroom door. He is frantic. He is trying to get away from something. The dog just stands there and watches him.
Adam goes back into the bedroom. We see two people dead. Their neck has been ripped open. He takes a gun from under the mattress. The creature is back in the room.
  Charlie (Anton Yelchin) likes girls. He is secure. He likes Amy (Imogen Poots). A new neighbor has moved in next door, but what is it with the dumpster and concrete?
  Charlie is annoyed by Evil Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is not returning his calls. Nick and Adam did not show up for school. Evil Ed has also noticed they have disappeared.
  Charlie's mom (Toni Collette) is getting to know the new neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell).
  Evil Ed is worried about Adam and looks in his home. He proceeds to tell Charlie that his next door neighbor is a vampire. Charlie becomes irritated at Evil and doesn't believe him. When Evil brings up Amy, Charlie violently pushes him down on the ground.
  Evil Ed will soon find out he is right about Jerry.

 Also in the cast: Dave Franco, Rick A. Ortega Jr., Lisa Loeb. Remember singer Lisa Loeb (""Stay (I Missed You)""?

  I did not like this version of Fright Night (2011). This ""Charlie"" was too abusive to his friend Evil Ed. The original ""Charley"" played by William Ragsdale in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night-1985-Blu-ray/dp/B006JN5KBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night (1985) [Blu-ray</a>] was funny.
 This ""Amy"" of 2011 does not appeal to me. The original ""Amy"" of 1985 played by Amanda Bearse was cute, had morals, possibly a virgin.
 This Evil Ed was acceptable, but who can ever compare with the performance of fragile ""Evil"" Ed played by Stephen Geoffreys who was perfect for the role.
  David Tennant took some getting used to as The Vampire Killer. I know him from his role as ""Dr. Who"" (2005-10). They had him play ""Peter Vincent"" as a rock 'n' roll-Las Vegas showman type.
  The original ""Peter Vincent"" was played by the well known Roddy McDowall in Fright Night (1985) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night-Part-II/dp/B00009YXHJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night Part II</a>&nbsp;(1988). Vincent was an actor, horror tv show host and actually could kill a vampire.

  I'm a big fan of the original Fright Night (1985), so watching this 2011 version, shows me how much times have really changed and how being young has changed.

  I liked the surprise appearance of Chris Sarandon and some of the special effects I have never seen before. Good acting from Colin Farrell. However, I did not like this 2011 version.

4224364,3,B003Y5H5FG,"I'm not trying to diss the actresses here (I've liked Toni Collete when she's playing basically the same role in several other movies, and the girlfriend has some good scenes), but everyone who's seen a horror film will know the horrible stereotypes that these women fall into. They are useless. Completely useless. Horror isn't the only genre to have its little stereotypes, but it's certainly the one that has the hardest time rising above them. I'm not sure why this should be the case except inasmuch as people have to act extremely irrationally to set up the most frightening scenes. But horror movie females have the worst time. They are always shrill and emotional, they never listen to the main character, and they generally start crying and breaking down in the most obnoxious ways at the worst possible moments. It's a stupid and sexist stereotype, and worse it's extremely annoying. They are obviously there only as a crutch for the main character so that the screenwriters can put him in situations which any sane man would avoid.

This film features a particularly egregious example of that. No, I don't blame the women for not believing the lead initially. He sounds crazy and he knows it. But once they are attacked by the vampire they get even worse. He just tried to blow their house up, then he hurled a bike at their car, yet the mother can't think to drive more than twenty miles per hour down a highway in the middle of the desert. When she realizes they're being chased she continues at the same speed and keeps telling her son that the man chasing them can't be a vampire. It doesn't matter woman! There's a crazy man trying to kill you! Whether he's a vampire or not is irrelevant. When someone wants you dead you get away fast. Simple. You certainly don't:
A. Drive slowly and let him pass you.
B. Just sit there when he blocks the road in front of you.
C. Faint.
She does all of these and it's beyond infuriating. I understand that you need to set up some sort of set-piece for the vampire's sheer awesomeness, but why can't you do it in a way that doesn't make everyone involved look like they're dumber than a bag of bricks. Nobody could possibly be that stupid, so kindly present us with some characters we can actually emphasize with. The girlfriend is significantly better (as well as actually having a character) but she then manages to get separated from her boyfriend in the middle of a rave. I get that they needed to get separated so he could rescue her, but again: believability. You shouldn't be getting abducted in the middle of a crowd and have nobody notice. I also doubt that a teenager can go into a store and buy a crossbow, then just walk down the street with it and have noone notice. When watching a vampire movie I don't want the vampire to be the most rational person there. It's not like there aren't any good women in horror movies. Ripley from Alien is one of the best and she's extremely rational. But horror films keep sticking with mindless bimbos and it has gotten really old.

This is especially unfortunate because the guys in this are great. Colin Farrel makes a great vampire, and David Tennant gets to play a stagey magician. The two younger actors are Anton Yelchin (Checkov) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin'). I've liked Yelchin ever since he was a kid, and Mintz-Plasse has impressed me by playing just about every variation on nerd in existence. That's not me being sarcastic, most actors who play nerdy kids have only one way of presenting it and that's why they don't last. All of these actors are good, but they can't rescue it from the stupidity that ensues whenever one of the women is onscreen. Yelchin's character does some stupid things, but he does some smart things too and his final battle is actually clever enough for me to forgive a lot. But it doesn't make up for the rest of the film. The women in this film are dumb, which isn't the fault of the actresses but the writers. Some stereotypes really need to die, because they are quite capable of ruining what looked like a promising movie.

So basically the scorecard is this:
Good: Male leads, vampire effects, overall plot, character development.
Bad: Female leads, plot details, believability.",1332115200,,4232,4.6550802139037435

4224420,3,B003Y5H5FG,"The (pardon the expression) revamp of this movie was not very well received.  It was released in that pergatory period for movies (early to mid-August) and it was at the theater and then--poof--gone.  That's a real shame because I enjoyed the movie.  The original, which I did enjoy more than the reboot, went more for comedy than actual horror.  ""Fright Night"" was a long-in-the-tooth local production hosted by Peter Vincent, fearless vampire killer (*nudge/nudge, wink/wink*).

Colin Farrell plays Jerry Dandridge in the redo.  His character is not comedic; heck, he's not even all that friendly.  He is evil and he's in town to do evil things.  Following the plot of the original, he moves into the house next to Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his mom--sans his ""goon"" from the first picture.  He has not come to this suburb of Las Vegas to make friends and give ""warm-fuzzies"" to people.  He has come to repopulate his kind and he wastes no time in doing so.  And he's on to Charley quicker than a duck on a June-bug.  The director (Craig Gillespie) didn't waste time on having a love story between Jerry and Charley's girlfriend, which I rather enjoyed.  Jerry saw her as simply another meal.

I don't quite understand why this version was publicized as a ""remake,"" because it was almost an entirely different story.  What worked in the first picture, wouldn't have necessarily worked in this one.  It was a different take and I enjoyed it.  Check it out.  The movie is rated R.

4224423,4,B003Y5H5FG,I thought this was superior to its 1980s predecessor.  Charlie Brewster is given more depth and characters are given motivations for their actions.  Women play a more important role in this story as Charlie's girlfriend doesn't find out the danger in the final 3rd of the movie and immediately become a victim and Charlie's mother actually gets involved in the story.  Colin Farrell portrays Jerry as just as much animal as human and there's even a surprise cameo by Chris Sarandon.  I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend.,1329696000,,526,5.011494252873563

Charlie is suspicious of the guy and warns his mother played by Toni Collette to stay away from him. Toni Collette is one of the gifted actors of our time and is underused in this, but its still nice to see her doing a fun movie for a change.

I saw the original which came out 26 years ago and thought it was ok. This one is better. While the original used more comedy, this one is darker, more horror and appropriate. It's well acted by the entire cast including the teens which you expect to find mediocre acting - not in this. They rise graciously to the challenge. One by one Charlie notices his classmates disappearing and it isn't long before he discovers that his neighbor is a vampire and not a nice one.

4224427,1,B003Y5H5FG,"This version would have done better to change the character names and a few of the sequences and the title. It could have stood on it's own. Many, many liberties were taken with the plot and subplots, sequences and character specific actions that really changed the story... but not enough to stand on it's own. There were too many similarities and yet too many differences to give it a true spot in hollywood vampire history.
If you liked the original I daresay you'll be very disappointed in this version. They didn't stay true to the plot. They really didn't even do an update or polishing of the original. They also didn't introduce new characters and the characters they have did not fully match the characters in the original.
In the original, the 'discovery' phase of the story was slow with doubts by Charlie. It wasn't his friend who made the discovery, in fact, his friend laughed at him. This version cuts to the issue in the first ten minutes... and I'm sure that has to do with running length of the movie.
The Peter Vincent character was nowhere near the original whatsoever. Huge disappointment. They totally left out his questioning of faith that was in the original.
In the original, the vampire had an assistant. This version had none. Not a huge loss, but definitely lost some scenes without him.
The whole vampire legend/lore was lost. They highlighted some points like wooden stakes and holy water and how to kill one, but they left out the hypnotic quality of their personality and the changing into a bat. Another disappointment.
So why one star? Colin Farrel was very good in his role and so was Toni Collette. The cameo by Chris Sarandon was nice and humorous.
In my opinion, they should have picked up where the original left off. Nobody has done that yet. At the end of the original you hear his friend's laughter coming from the house next door... which obviously meant he was still alive (?). Part two gave you a whole new group of vampires and didn't really connect to the original. I think a part 3 with the friend who's still alive would work.
I think the original had a great story, well played out, well acted and left it open for a sequel, which nobody picked up on. This version just ruins the story.",1328659200,6,2236,4.606516290726817

OOS EFFECTS:
There are about 20 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and 17 more reached the 20%-30% range. In addition, a cross floats to 35%, a rock flies out to 40% and on 3 separate occasions burning embers reach a maximum of 40, 45 & 50%.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
As you would expect with a vampire movie, there are many dark scenes. Dim lighting is not a friend to 3D so on occasion, you may find yourself straining to see the action. The depth is slightly inconsistent from scene to scene but it is said to be a variation that this film maker intended.

If you like vampire/gore movies, this makes a good addition to your 3D collection.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
On my system, in addition to some slight ghosting, 9 scenes had easily noticeable crosstalk and in 2 of them, double images were very distracting. However I still found this film very enjoyable.

4224501,4,B003Y5H5FG,"As if the housing mortgage dilemma isn't enough of a bummer, here come the vampires to further sabotage the property values. A pervading sense of isolation informs the opening moments of FRIGHT NIGHT as the camera sweeps into a shot of a desolate Vegas suburban sprawl entirely surrounded by desert. It's an unsettling image. It sets you up for the terrifying stuff later on.

This is a neighborhood in which blackened or boarded up windows are common sights, what with foreclosing as the new norm (hey, thanks, economy) and many residents in the community who tend to work night shifts and sleep during the day. So what's another house with darkened windows? Teenager Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) doesn't think twice of his new next-door-neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell), who keeps strange hours and has unsightly dumpsters and debris decorating his lawn. But then people start vanishing, and it's at this point that Charley's estranged nerd chum, Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), begins accusing Charley's charming new neighbor of being a vampire. All of a sudden, Charley, who always did stress out too much, has a new thing to worry about. Especially since Jerry seems to be eyeing his single mom (Toni Collette) and his hot girlfriend (Imogen Poots).

Let us not talk falsely now. This remake doesn't hold a candle to the original. Yep, I'm one of them what loves the 1985 version, and so the most telling points for me are that this, er, revamp dispenses with the original's more subtle touches and that Tennant's Peter Vincent doesn't have as many showcase moments as did McDowall's Peter Vincent. And there are several missed opportunities, I think. Sin City itself, Las Vegas, for instance, could've been featured more prominently as a secondary character, that old den of decadence. I can't think of any other place so well suited for vampires. In that sequence in Peter Vincent's posh apartment which has Charley and Amy fighting for their lives, it's practically wasteful how Peter Vincent's collection of vampire-slaying paraphernalia wasn't employed near enough in taking out the undead. And Jerry, our 400-year-old monster, does seem to have an odd way of keeping a low profile. He's supposed to be trying to blend in. What he does after the Brewsters wouldn't invite him in is pretty over the top and something that's bound to attract glaring attention. So that didn't make sense.

But those are the quibbles. What are the good bits? I thought the acting was solid all across, although Yelchin may be getting too old to play high schoolers. Colin Farrell submits a more scruffy, more feral bloodsucker than did Chris Sarandon, although he's just as charming. It's a different take, that's all, and not a bad one, at that. (By the way, Sarandon shows up in a cameo as a victim.) Farrell exudes this shady vibe. There's a very well done scene in which Jerry is standing right outside the open doorway of Charley's house, waiting for Charley to lend his a six-pack of beer. It's apparent that he's waiting for Charley to ask him in, but Charley at this stage has got the wind up, is starting to put the pieces together. You can feel that aura of menace just start to build and emanate from Jerry as he realizes that he's not going to get an invite after all. It's one of the best scenes in the film. Meanwhile, David Tennant makes the most of his showy role, playing the boozy and indifferent Las Vegas stage magician who's boned up on vampire methodology. He's fun to watch and his Peter Vincent is very different from his Doctor Who role. But he's no Roddy McDowall. For that matter, when it comes to playing Evil Ed, Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have the impact of a Stephen Geoffreys.

I do recommend FRIGHT NIGHT the remake. There are pretty good scares, although, as in the original version, it flirts with the tongue-in-cheek stuff. This plays right in the wheelhouse of screenplay writer Marti Noxen, who used to pen episodes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Maybe the highest compliment I could pay this FRIGHT NIGHT is that it sort of recaptures that cool LOST BOYS vibe. Not that I'm saying this is as good as THE LOST BOYS. But if you see this playing on cable, stop and look. At least these vampires don't have sparkles.

4224506,3,B003Y5H5FG,"**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 8/23/11**

Fright Night was not a movie I was planning to see a few weeks ago. But then I started hearing such great things from critics and others that I had to give it a whirl. Plus, each year around this time there seems to be a supernatural-type film that makes no money at the box office but becomes a personal favorite (last year it was the brilliant Let Me In, still one of my favorite movies of the past few years, and before that it was Jennifer's Body). I was hoping this would follow suit, even though I knew nothing about the original. I was going into this one cold. Honestly, that's kind of how I left the theater, too.

The main frustration I had with the film is that it kept reeling me in only to let me down. It was like the peaks on a roller coaster. One moment I'd be all excited, the next I'd be slouched back in my seat, daydreaming. To compare similar movies, in 2007 Disturbia managed to keep me hooked throughout. It's a hard thing to do. The problem with this one is that tension isn't allowed to build because the big reveal/mystery is pretty much spoiled in scene one. We know the creepy neighbor's a vampire, so what follows is basically your standard teen suspense film.

However, the action sequences are frequently inspired, particularly an encounter on a dark Vegas highway and a scene in the middle of the film that, without giving too much away, subverts audience expectations and ends with a wonderfully sick surprise (and I'm not easily surprised). Colin Farrell makes an incredibly unnerving villain, and when he--and others--vamp up, they look pretty damn awesome. These aren't your friendly, sparkly vamps. There's a constant danger surrounding the film. The supporting cast, filled with familiar faces, is pretty strong too.

I was less impressed with the casting of the lead. I've liked Anton Yelchin in Star Trek, Charlie Bartlett and Terminator: Salvation, but for me he was totally miscast in this role. I don't feel like he carried the film the way that he needed to, and I felt no connection to his character. It's crazy, because I really like this actor. Something just didn't click. David Tennant (of Doctor Who fame) is much more effective.",1327708800,,2245,4.661616161616162

Colin Farrel is absolutely terrifying and the teen boys do a good job. The differences between those boys and the original aren't too different, except the main character is not as ""nerdy"" as the original. As far as the Peter Vincent character, I thought it was brilliant that they ""modernized"" him into a Criss Angel-type performer, which is more realistic to this day and time.

The ending was well thought and well performed.  My favorite scene is when the girl shoots the vampire.
The scenes of the movie I felt were poorly done were the confrontations between Evil Ed and Charlie. The performances were very weak. The Evil Ed of the first version was a thousand times better and more believable, in my opinion.

That doesn't exist in the remake, I barely had my popcorn ready as my wife and I sat down to a horror movie night when the fact that there was a vampire and everyone accepted that fact and decided to kill it was revealed.  Everything seemed so unnecessarily rushed just to get to the action scenes that it took away from the story.
I'm not against remakes or re-imagings but I left this movie thinking that it would have been so so so much better if they had just stuck to the original script.  The acting was good and the special effects were......well, they actually weren't that great, but they were good enough.

4224537,5,B003Y5H5FG,"In other words it sucked fangs big time at the box office in the U.S. pulling in only $18 million out of its $30 million budget. But it wasn't the only failure with money at the remakes/prequels box office in the year of 2011... Movies such as Conan: The Barbarian and The Thing, both truly entertaining and superb films didn't even cover the budget and Final Destination 5 pulled in almost the right amount. Fright Night was such a well thought out movie. It was a modern and extremely well done remake than not even David Tennant nor could Collin Farrell save from the Box Office!

Plot: Jerry Danridge has moved next door to a peaceful family, Jane (Mother) and Charlie (Son) Brewster. They are very acceptant of him but when Charlie learns some information from his ex best friend Evil Ed Thompson that Jerry is in fact a vampire, He mocks him..... That is until Ed doesn't show up to school the next day... that makes him a little suspicious..... Hearing Jerry talk about how he'd better mind his own business.... He gets a bit worried then what sets it all off when he hears/sees his next door neighbor Doris meet a gruesome death! He soon seeks help from T.V. celebrity star Peter (Douchebag) Vincent... who immediately calls Charlie crazy and tells him to leave.... The big question lies within the original trailer (which mostly does cover the plot) ""What would you do if you accidently discovered that the house next door was being occupied by something not human, no one believes you, not your mom, not your girlfriend, not even the police, it knows that you know, you'll do anything to protect yourself. but it'd do anything to protect it's secret!""

Review: What a perfect remake... It is able to create something new while still maintaining the old in a ""Modern"" fashion. It has everything, Actors who act like today's society and not something just written down on a piece of paper they acted like they wanted to and did it perfect. It's got gore and blood, salty language, the only thing there wasn't in this remake was the sex scene which I felt was a breathe of fresh air mainly because most horror movies have at least one or two sex scenes in which this one would rather work on a real and secure level while still being different from the rest. This is how vampires should be not like Evil Ed described as fruity or love sick but they should be like the shark from ""Jaws"" or even the ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex from ""Jurassic Park"". Hell, it could even be as bad ass as Freddy Kruger with all the one liners Jerry Preformed such as ""don't need an invitation if there is no house!"" But I believe the greatest advantage this film had over the original was the blood and gore!

Acting: Pure fun! And full of passion about each line that came out was perfect there were no bad actors in this film! Not even the security guard or the body guards were bad.... this is one of those films where there were no bad actors... well maybe some drunk/fowl mouth actors (such as Peter Vincent) but even he was great at acting!

Gore: As I said before the gore was a great advantage over the original! We get grisly bites, a nasty severed arm, lots of blood splatter, throat slashing, some gory dead bodies and more! Beat that Ed to the Ward!

Bottom Line: An indestructible, superb remake that will always have a place in my collection/heart! It deserves all the money it can get. it was just epic and genius! It definitely needs a sequel!

4224538,3,B003Y5H5FG,"I wouldn't normally take time to talk about this movie but I'd like to make a point about something that saddens me within Hollywood and that is: the darn endings.

You have a story that is not original but is still fun and enticing. You have characters that are functioning as archetypes but are still engaging and charismatic. You have the  technical aspect of the film that is, as far as I can see, first rate. The creators obviously had fun and seemed to be honest about the simple pleasure they wanted to share with us. Everybody, it's plain to see, has given their best and a bit more in order to entertain us. The actors, in particular, are way better than what would normally be expected for that kind of product. Even the score is better than average. Plus, the writers are dealing right away with some plot twists in order to move forward instead of stretching them endlessly until the end. And as far as being a remake, the movie was even surprising at some point with some changes here and there, especially in the point of view about who believes what.

But there you have it. All of this is wasted on the fact that a darn product from Hollywood has to last about two hours and needs to have a big ending with lots of special effects. In this case, what the creators had set up was very promising. But it was too much for 120 minutes. At some point, they needed to conclude and wrap up everything in a big fiery conclusion. What had taken a long time to install now needed to be rush to the end. As soon as Jerry the vampire arrives in Vegas, the rest of the movie is sadly lost in a whirlwind of special effects and over the top story devices all made to conclude the story with a bang! Therefore, a character well drawn like Jerry Dandridge, who says: ""What were you thinking, Charley? That you would just going to walk in here with your little crossbow, and put to bed four hundred years of survival?"" is left to die like a debutant almost right after saying that great line!

And because everything needs to be rushed, characters are starting to make no sense. For example, Charley is trying to tell his mom about vampires but he has no time to explain... cause the story needs to move along. And he gets upset that she does not believe him! Furthermore, he's scared that his neighbor (Jerry the vampire) might kill her but he tells his mom to trust him and that she simply should not talk to jerry... and he gets out! Without further explanations!

So what do you have? A great pop corn movie, promising and better than average, but that is sadly botched away by an over the top ending and a need to wrap up everything real fast. The well drawn characters are therefore becoming stupid and the great setting up of the story is wasted. A common trend in Hollywood.

They should take example on how the rest of the world, especially the Europeans, are finishing their movies in general. I'm not talking about the rest of their cinematography, their philosophy and how they construct their narratives. Just the end.

A remake of the cult film made in 1985 directed by Tom Holland (who went on to make ""Child's Play""), the 2011 version of ""Fright Night"" refuses to be taken seriously. Not that this is a comedy (though occasionally humorous, not too overtly so), but if you are looking for a very scary movie, this is not the one for you. Despite the merciless nature of the vampire, the film's tongue-in-cheek approach in mixing laughs with scares tends to make the film itself less scary than some might expect.

Imogen Poots plays Charley's girlfriend and Toni Collette Charley's mother. Their roles are rather thankless ones, compared to Charley's hapless friend Ed, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and a scenery-chewing Las Vegas magician and vampire expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant).

Set in and around Las Vegas, the isolated suburban location is effectively captured by cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (known for ""The Others"" and yes, the ""Twilight"" series).

A few years ago some CGI company came up with the CGI effect of burning some evil thing by turning them into glowing ashes and has been used by studios many times since. Evil thingies with piranha teeth has been a hot prop the past few years but is also getting a bit old.

Creative part:
There were enough twists to the story in terms of who our lead vamp was; who was bitten; the search for the teen vamp hunter's helper and the tools acquired to accomplish the fait accompli. OK, the burning ashes CGI, although overused, worked in this case. And OK, in this case the piranha green screen teeth were rather tasty.

4224586,1,B003Y5H5FG,"Confession: this viewer has not seen the original 1985 version of FRIGHT NIGHT and is not a fan of the interminable line of vampire movies that flood the screens year after year.  So why watch FRIGHT NIGHT 2011?  Seeing the names of fine actors such as Colin Farrell, Toni Colette, +/- Anton Yelchin suggested this might not be a bad movie if those actors committed to it.  And perhaps it is partly due to the fact that lack of exposure to this genre creates the problem of deciding why some people find these films funny while other find them frightening. So, preface over.  Given the virginal approach to this vampire film, this viewer finds it silly, poorly written, self indulgent - and  an unexplainable waste to talent.

Tom Holland is recycled by Marti Nixon and the updated Las Vegas suburb community form is handed to director Craig Gillespie.  The 'plot' centers on the presence of one Jerry (Colin Farrell, subtle acting at first and then falls apart) as the resident vampire next door to Century 1 Realtor Jane Brewster (Toni Collette) and her nerdy son Charley (Anton Yelchin).  Charley's equally nerdy friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is convinced that Jerry is a vampire and carries crosses and stakes etc in preparation for meeting him (an early taste treat for Jerry, Ed becomes a ridiculously distorted mad man).  The two lads are mocked by fellow classmates Mark (Dave Franco, brother of James Franco) and Ben (Reid Ewing) and teased by the very beautiful Amy (Imogen Poots).  Kids go missing and soon Charley becomes a believer and form there on out it is a detective game to rout out Jerry.  Charley, once convinced that Jerry is indeed a vampire, seeks guidance from the alcoholic scare-showman Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who has secrets of his own.  Of course it is evident that it will turn out just fine, but getting there (to the end) is a tedious bore.  The musical score is by Ramin Djawadi and the cinematography (thankfully mostly in the after hours dark vampires so need) is by Javier Aguirresarobe.

Perhaps this is funny to some and perhaps it is frightening to others: after all there is a faithful cult of addicts who run to the theaters whenever one of these vampire flicks is released.  It is an acquire taste....Grady Harp, January 12",1325548800,,2279,4.792838874680307

You can tell they were trying to make the characters have depth, but all you see is this facade of ""care about this character"" without any real reason to. I never even really got why Charlie would get involved, because he didn't care about his friends that got killed.. maybe only because Jerry talked to his mom? The overly CGI vampire teeth and morphing was very distracting as well. (I rather hate it when movies make vampires totally morph). And David Tennant's moments and humor were far too brief.
Overall, if you generally like vampire movies, maybe check this out to see for yourself, but I for one did not enjoy it.

I have a 3d plasma tv so I try to get movies in 3d when I can.

This is just a quick review of the 3d without spoiling the effects.

This movie is dark, so wearing 3d glasses makes it even darker.  At first I was a bit dissapointed with this, but not every scene looked too dark.  To make up for it the movie had numerous 3d ""pop outs"" which surprised me (I acutally wasn't expecting much). I like it when I rewatch scenes to see the ""pop out"" again as I did with this movie.

I will probably go back and watch the original again.  In any case, if you like good horror...with a little comedic stuff mixed in as well...especially if you like a good vampire movie, then I highly recommend checking this movie out.  The cast was great and the movie was well made...and I really liked the end of it as well.  I may even buy this movie...I don't think I've bought a horror movie in quite a while, but then again I haven't seen one in a while that I liked as much as this one.

4224636,1,B003Y5H5FG,"This is such an amateur, gutless typically tepid Hollywood remake. The film spends way too much time superficially developing the vapid relationship between the lead character and his popular girlfriend. The lead character, Charlie, is made to be a phony who would turn his back on his best friend just to be popular. The lead character's best friend, Ed, is not nearly as unique as he was in the original. Most disappointing, is the fact that Ed's story arc is not handled with any psychological or deep-emotional impact as it was in the original Fright Night. Colin Ferrell does a good job as Jerry, but his character is written without any dimension. Like almost every character in this film Ferrell's character feels as if he has no past. He's just an idea on a piece of paper. David Tennent does a good job with his interpretation of Peter Vincent but the character in this remake is way too pretentious and cowardly, and Tennant's performance isn't charming enough to make the character endearing to the audience. The original Peter Vincent may've been pretentious and cowardly, but Roddy McDowell's performance, along with Todd Holland's original vision, made Peter Vincent someone you wanted to cheer for. Lastly, the special effects are completely unconvincing. You'd think when they saw how fake some of the special effects looked they would've said, ""Maybe we should work on that some more.""

Like it is with many remakes, the heart and soul is missing from the remake of Fright Night. Everything about the original seemed lovingly produced.  Unlike the original, this film just feels like another movie that the participants will likely forget just as quickly as this summer's movie-going audience forgot it. If you really want to see a good horror movie, I recommend you rent or buy something with some originality and guts, like the original Fright Night, or, if you want something more recent, Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil.",1325116800,9,1934,4.966049382716049
4224637,3,B003Y5H5FG,"FRIGHT NIGHT has two saving graces: Anton Yelchin, who plays Charlie
Brewster with the right mix of humor and a good grip on his character,
and David Tennant who plays the TV vampire destroyer with a good deal
of cultivated arrogance and outlandish attitudes.

Beyond these performances, the rest of the film is only mildly
successful in the casting. Colin Farrell is a disappointment in the
role that Chris Sarandon played to perfection as the original ""vampire
next door"" type with a lot more sexual heat than Colin exhibits in an
underplayed style. And even back in 1985, the special effects were a
lot more horrifying than those employed here which represent CGI at its
worst.

But most of all, the entire script has made drastic changes in the
story that ""for better or worse"" are strictly for the worse. Fans of
the original film will hardly recognize what has been done to the
story, much less the characters.

However, Toni Collette as Brewster's mother and Imogen Poots as his
pretty girl friend are excellent, given what material they have to work
with, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse gets some comic relief from the Evil
Ed character that he becomes after ""the bite."" In this case, his Evil
Ed is much less effective than the one in the original film.

So many of the key scenes are played in virtual darkness, making it
impossible to see what is actually going on at important moments in the
action sequences. This is way below standard for a horror film that is
supposed to be scaring the audience realistically.

Summing up: A waste of time and money. See the original and you'll
understand why I lack enthusiasm for this remake which attempts to be
stylish and cool and full of rough language.",1325030400,,1706,4.730639730639731
4224638,4,B003Y5H5FG,"While the original version is one of my favorite 80s vampire flicks, you have to appreciate this decent remake because it comes at a perfect time when what we needed from a vampire film today was a good ""fright.""  There are no lovable shiny vampires here!

Colin Farrell is awesome as the sexy, alluring, and dangerous Jerry. Anton Yelchin is perfect as the geeky hero Charley who gets the girl in the end. Toni Collette, from United States of Tara, does a great job as Charley's mom. I loved seeing Christopher Charles Mintz-Plasse as the friend, Ed.  Fans will recognized him from movies Superbad and Role Models. He plays the same type of geek here as he often has, but gets to shine as a big bad vampire in the end.  And fans of the original will certainly recognize Chris Sarandon from the original who makes a cameo appearance.

With its eerie music and ""bump in the night"" moments to set the tone and make you jump, the movie holds true to the original more than I expected. Special effects were decent and scary as well.

What I love about this movie is that despite the fact that it's another vampire movie (and a remake at that) the story was unique and original. The acting was great too. There is only one instance that I thought seemed unlikely even if vampires were real. After their house exploded, the next morning there still were no cops there? Anyways, I don't think it took away from the movie. The movie wasn't exactly scary, but it was a fright fest, and there were several scenes that had my heart racing.

On the whole I try and stay away from remakes as I think what's the point in remaking something that was really good in the first place and when I heard about them remaking Fright Night I was ""OMG you're kidding me right.""
Then I heard Colin Farrell was the vampire and I despaired even more, while I like him as an actor, in the original the vampire was sophisticated and no disrespect to Mister Farrell but he's more of a action actor. So I had no intention of seeing the remake until I heard David Tennant was in it (As the Peter Vicent character) and I became intrigued. Firstly how they we going to use him and secondly if they were going for a younger cast how it would work. And to be honest it works brilliantly, the new film is nothing like the original. I think there's only a few scenes where it even makes a small nod to the original, but the whole cast really do put on a great show. It's funny, okay not really scary and a bit gory. More gory than the original but hey no bad thing right?
Colin plays the new Jerry as a more muscular, working man vampire and David Tennant plays the Peter Vincent character almost like if Russell Brand was a magician and it does work pretty well. There's even a cameo to look out for by the original Jerry (Chris Saraddon, but overall it works because unlike other remakes I've seen it's not trying to be the original, it's been changed for a more modern audience and it's nice to see a few more dangerous vampires around that don't sparkle :)",1324944000,3,1628,4.204472843450479

However, do expect a great film that adds a new flavor to the story, one of the biggest changes was to Peter Vincent no longer being the old aged, late night tv host and is instead a younger and rather funny and dark Vegas magician with a past that is somewhat revealed to us.

Fright Night 2011 brings several new story elements to the table without destroying the integrity of the 1985 original. Now...if I had to choose and put one of the two movies in a time capsule as an example of a great horror movie I'd hands down pick the original. But Fright Night 2011 is pretty good has some darn scary moments.

While Fright Night 1985 had a good mix of horror and humor, Fright Night 2011 sticks mostly to the spooky. Colin Farrell is the new Jerry Dandridge (the guy with the fangs) and Jerry likes to snack on high schoolers. Kind of like that other Jerry in the news today from Penn State. Up and comer Anton Yelchin is Charlie Brewster who makes it his personal business to take Jerry down.

Like I said, there are some genuinely scary moments and I was entertained from start to relatively quick finish. The movie has an R rating but it seemed more deserving of a PG-13 to me.

In his lines he kind of channeled a couple of actors.  The one I recognized very quickly was Christopher Walken.  I couldn't pin down the next one but it came with the line ""Because there are a lot of bad people out there Charlie.""  ""Thanks for the beer""  .  May have been Clint Eastwood.

4224693,2,B003Y5H5FG,"This is the first movie I've rented/streamed online from the Amazon website. $1.99 was just fine: cheaper, of course, than a DVD rental or seeing it in the theatres. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed in the flick and didn't have fun with it.

Here are some various thoughts:

- I think it's fine that Peter Vincent was a magician/illusionist....but I was very-much hoping that that would be a part of it in someway. I was picturing a creative illusion or trickery that, in some way, fooled at least one of the vampires and led to its demise. I think that would have been awesome. Even though that didn't happen, lil' Petey's just a foul mouthed jerk and totally unlikable. A full-of-himself, ignorant, gross, alcoholic worm -- the worst part of the flick and totally opposite of the awesome Roddy McDowell and his distinguished representation of Mr. Vincent.

- My favourite part here was actually quite tame: when Jerry was wanting Charlie's beer, but he couldn't come into the house since he wasn't invited. Charlie was 'testing' him...and Jerry couldn't even stick his hand in the doorway to reach for the beer, making it more obvious that something was amiss.

- Jerry causing the house of the Brewster's to explode because he couldn't get invited in (and nobody in the neighbourhood noticing). Give me a break. As well, the Brewster's didn't even seem to care much afterwards that they lost everything!

- Amy is just eye-candy, as is the mom. For the women in the audience, Jerry would be as well...but they are all disposable characters that are boring and smile too much.

- Ed (aka 'Evil') was just a normal nerd and within the first few minutes he comes out and tells Charlie that Jerry is a vampire. It was better when Charlie was trying to convince 'Evil' and others that there was a a vampire living next to him. What about Ed's evidence? I saw Charlie checking it out on the Ed's computer after Ed was killed -- but it seemed to show nothing of interest. Ed should have had more of a part, as he was kinda cool to this nerd.

- They say that Chris Sarandon (the original Jerry in the 1985 version) made an appearance but I didn't notice. Oh well. 12.21 UPDATE: He's the driver who pulled-up to see what was going on and was bitten by the new Jerry Dandrige. I had no clue; of course he didn't look like he did over 25 years ago, yet he didn't sound the same either.

- Dandrige was duller than a lone razor in a barber shop. He didn't change form into a bat or wolf, which vampires did in the original; had no scary/appropriate voice; died fast and bored
me even faster. Well, at least he still eats the apples. An apple a day keeps the dentist away (that's how the saying should go, as I've learned that's more accurate). Does he go to a nighttime dentist if there's such a thing? Do vampires get cavities? That's one question I'd love to have answered and another expectation that was a letdown in this flick. (Don't be ridiculous and take that serious).

- Charlie 'gearing-up' was cool and his idea which came to fruition at the end was pretty-cool. It was the only thing of originality. I liked how it ended Dandridge and it was worthwhile -- yet it all happened too quickly and there wasn't much suspense. The CGI looked like garbage, too, throughout the flick and some of the other vampire's endings were very ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer""-like (of course, being written by Marti Noxon as well, I think that would be expected).

Anyway, ""Welcome to 'Fright Night'...for fake."" should be the tag line for this. Go ahead and rent it online. It can be passable at occasional moments, but I didn't enjoy it. CGI is not good for this re-imagining and non-computer effects would have been better. It's completely not a horror flick and barely makes two stars.",1324339200,5,3769,4.586924219910847
4224694,4,B003Y5H5FG,"In 1985, the original FRIGHT NIGHT was released and it was an immediate classic. The next door neighbor of a teen turns out to be a vampire, leading to a showdown between the unlikely hero and the near invincible creature of the night. So, in 2011, when FRIGHT NIGHT, a remake or re-imagining was released, I wasn't particularly eager to see it. There are too many remakes as it is and to remake something that was such a classic didn't make much sense, but they remade TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and FRIDAY THE 13th, so why not?
The first thing that stands out in the new movie is that everyone looks like a model for the most part. There was no average looking people. Even the high school teacher was attractive and when I went to high school, the women were all elderly or pigs...there were no hot teachers. Everyone in the classroom, with the exception of the intentional geek, Ed (Christopher Mintz - Plasse), could have been on the cover of a magazine. You see this all the time now. They don't even take fat extras anymore.

Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a teenager that lives in a little community in the desert of Las Vegas, Nevada. His next door neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell), makes a bad impression immediately by having a huge dumpster parked in his driveway. Charley's mother, Jane (Toni Collette), makes a fuss, but when she is charmed by Jerry, she lets it go. He just seems like a nice guy that she wouldn't mind banging.

Ed is a hilarious character, much like the first. This time, Charley used to be best friends with him, but the pressure of high school has prompted him to cut ties. He is now with the ""in crowd"" while Ed is an outcast, but he is not a quiet one. I thought it was hilarious how he kept blackmailing Charley with pictures and video of the past, where they were battling Dungeons and Dragons style. Unfortunately, Ed's time on the screen isn't much, and Jerry takes him out quite early. It was a surprise, which is part of this film's charm. You think one thing is going to happen, but something else does.

One of the coolest scenes in the film is when Charley goes looking for Ed, who is missing. He goes to his house and starts fishing around on his computer, finding video that Ed recorded. Jerry doesn't appear on the video. Vampires don't cast a reflection and to see the vehicle drive up and the door open without anyone visible getting out was quite cool. Ed saying ""I got you,"" made the scene even better. It was a nice variation of the original where Peter Vincent realized that he didn't see Jerry in the mirror.

In the original, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) was a cheesy horror host that you would see all the time in the 1970s. Considering the differences in time, the character had to be changed and so now we have Peter Vincent (David Tennant), a Mindfreak sort of magician in Vegas that is known as the ""Vampire Killer."" You can't replace McDowall and the character isn't nearly as charming, but I still found Tennant's portrayal very amusing.

Charley and his girlfriend, Amy (Imogen Poots), approach Peter after Jerry turns vampire and attacks the duo and Charley's mom on the road. The CGI look of the full-fledged vampire wasn't so great. He looked reptilian and cartoonish, but CGI is winning over traditional make up, and here is another example. The look of the first vampire in the 1985 flick was way better.

Jerry kidnaps Amy and now Charley and Peter Vincent are off to kill Jerry and save her. It is a big showdown in the house in Vegas.

FRIGHT NIGHT isn't as good as the first, but it is not without its charm. It moves a little quickly and the look of the vampires was pretty mediocre, but the characters are very likeable, especially Ed, and the movie is different enough to stand alone as a good horror entry. I recommend it.

4224696,1,B003Y5H5FG,"I love Collin, Collete and Anton. They are always a joy to watch. But not here. This is not even close to the spirit of the original Fright Night nor does it bring anything new thats awe inspiring that would make it at least a serious attempt to scare us in whole new different ways. While the original had a buildup, kid noticing weird new tenant and helper moving coffin into basement, Charly spying new tenant with hooker in the buff, tenant opens mouth exposing fangs,suddenly his eyes roll upward to Charlies window and his very long fingernail pull the shades down,all these with a real creepy eerie soundtrack playing,just one of the real creepy haunting moments.  Something funny is going on here. He spies, calls the cops and no one beleives him, not even his friends take him seriously. This took about almost 30 minutes to accomplish. In this remake we hear about a vampire being in town in the first 5 minutes. 15 minutes later Evil Ed, Charleys scoffing outcast friend who barely has role of any substance here is turned, while in the original he tried with Charleys girlfriend and Peter Vincent to prove that Charley basically is in need of help

Collin Farrell seemed like he was told it would be a comedy, the boozy happy go lucky next door neigbor. The original Dandridge was a subdued threat covered by a gentlemanly charm, charming while Collins is a smug beer swilling shmuck if you really wanna know what acts like. Wow, thats real inventive, the vampire who not being invited in hangs at the door borrowing beer.

Most of the time its Farrel acting more like a homicidal maniac then a vampire. Blow up the house to get in. Blow up the house you blow up Charly so what do you care if you can enter or not. The car chase scene with an appearance by the original real vampire Chris Sarandon was lame. Borrowed from 1978s the Body Snatchers where Kevin McCarthny spoofs his role in 1956 movie running down the street being chased by the Pod People still yelling your next. Now that was a great moment. Sarandons appearance was just a paycheck.

And Peter Vincent? HAHAHAHAHA. Midori swilling Magician who is about as helpful as salt on a wound, his screen time thankfully was limited as well. Well its not his fault that it was the late great Roddy McDowell who played Peter Vincent, a role that would have been perfect for Peter Cushing as well I thought, though at this time Cushing was ill it would have been great to see Hammers Vampire killer doing it American style, but I digress. This was also a fine build up as Charley first approaches a now dated pink slipped Vampire Killer who does a marvelous job trying to get away and into his car from Charley whom he starts to fear as being a lunatic.

Amanda Bearse role though it wasn't a neccesity, they could have used the time with the chick Charlie loved and developed another angle to the story and be creative. And then their is the climax of this movie that was just short of retarded, Dandridge living in an unfinished house without any stucco yet on the wallboarding and keeping his victims in the walls in layers of earth. And the face change?  Give the originals hellishly great makeup job they did on Sarandon.

4224732,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I read on here (right before the disc was available for sale) that this movie was not all that great, so I didn't buy it. Well seeing as how Amazon has given me credit towards instant videos I decided to watch it. From the beginning to the end something is going on, not like in the original where it was slow in the beginning and then picked up. Also Chris Sarandon (The original Jerry)made a cameo appearance in this film. Colin Farrell did an amazing job as Jerry and Evil Ed was great also. I can't believe that I slept on this movie because of a few bad reviews from others. I won't really say much about the movie, except there were some intense moments, but all in all I loved this movie! Also they changed Peter Vincent around and it was a good decision especially for this decade. Back in the 80s the late night horror host worked but it wouldn't fly now. I wasn't too sure how the Chris Angel version would work, but it did......watch this movie.",1324166400,2,956,4.316666666666666

I'm not sure why they chose to remake this movie instead of just making their own vampire flick but they failed horribly.

The original was great horror film with plenty of very scary scenes and a great plot, this movie threw out the plot, every scary scene, the nudity, and all the great make up work. Instead they replaced it with a straight to dvd plot and a ton of cheesy cgi that made it seem more like a cartoon than a horror movie.

Skip this one and rent the original, you'll be happy you did.",1324166400,5,626,4.243697478991597
4224734,3,B003Y5H5FG,"Well, we certainly love our spunky reboots these days. J.J. Abrams perfected the formula with Star Trek, and Matthew Vaughn followed suit, adopting a very similar tone with X Men: First Class. These are electric, exuberant reboots which exude youth and gloss. Fright Night, in theory, only manages to snuggle alongside two of these other films on a loose basis. But it's not until proper viewing that it becomes clear that all of these films are built upon very similar foundations; they may not be neighbors, but they certainly share the same suburban neighborhood.

Well, fair enough. I can dig this new scene, if only for the fact that its approach has resulted in a provocative, acceptably tense vampire movie that respects the lore and retains the sex symbol attractions without adhering to Twilight's rules. A little bit of this has to do with Gillespie's brash directing, but the rest of the charm owes itself to Colin Ferrell, who seems despicably confident in a role like this. His hip, lax attitude is a refreshing take on the everyday vampire; there's not a drop of teenage angst to be found, here, folks, and that even applies to the rest of the cast.

Upcomer Yelchin shows range as the cry wolf kid who takes vampire killing matters into his own hands, Poots (what an unfortunate last name) who was encouraging in her past role in 28 Weeks later, doesn't disappoint, and Mintz-Plasse is Mintz-Plasse. The surprising inclusion of David Tennant is an odd choice that almost pays off, but his pompous, pseudo Russel Brand tendencies seem out of place before the credits start to role. For all of its style and humor, the suspense often feels like the black sheep stuck on the outside. Gillespie is clearly eager to get to the money shots, with hardly fifteen minutes going by before Jerry claims his first victim on the big screen.

 It works for its strong moments of intensity but, for what it's worth, this is a giddy date movie if there ever was one, and you'll do well to find your scares elsewhere. I was initially hard pressed in justifying a remake for a film that so fully embodies the term ""cult classic"", to the point where, I'd suspect, at least half of the audience thought of this as a standalone. But it's difficult to argue with things done right, even if they don't stay true to their roots. The original Fright Night is a self-conscious classic that undoubtedly inspired the likes of ""Scream"". All that Gillespie's new take will likely recall is a thankful - if forgettable - alternative to the vampire scene of present, but if anything' worth your time anymore, it's something new.",1324166400,,2611,4.744493392070485

They almost always get it wrong; the characters, the atmosphere/just the general ""feel"" of the original. Well Frght Night 2011 doesn't try to copycat the original nor does it try to replace it. The 2011 film simply tries to be a fresh take on the original and succeeds very well. Both Colin Farrell and Anton Yelchin are in peak form and the girlfriend is a joy to behold. Unlike other franchises...""cough"" Transformers...she's not just window dressing, overbearing or just plain an annoyance. Imogene Poots (What were her parents smoking) plays Amy as believable and more importantly likable. David Tennant also brought a totally different and yes fresh Peter Vincent to screen. I throughly enjoyed his performance especially how nothing about his screen-Peter Vincent was real (so funny) but he had the tallest shoes to fill; Roddy McDowall simply cannot be replaced.

Nothing about the 2011 film felt rehashed or been there done that. Though the original will always remain a champion among the genre this 2011 film has gained a well respected seat on the bench. It can ""play"" on my team any time.",1324080000,,1212,4.912195121951219

I took a chance last night and watched it - and I am happy I did. While I thought the car scene was poorly edited (which is why I only went 4 starts)I liked everything else and would watch it again. This movie is meant to be serious; it's supposed to be fun! Like the original (which is funny because I just caught it on TV the other night), the director understood that and didn't just make a cheesy re-make, the plot and names of the characters are essentially the same and the updates to the story worked really well. They also did a good job with the music; I am guessing the folks who worked on this film were fans of the original!!",1324080000,,761,4.08
4224759,4,B003Y5H5FG,"As many of you know, Fright Night-originally- was a 1985 American Horror film that was directed by Tom Holland. Loved by fans, it told the story of Charley Brewster who's a young high school boy who discovers that his next door neighbor is a Vampire. Realizing this,  Charley turns to his hero: Peter Vincent to help him get rid of the problem. Because Charley won't look the other way(so to speak), his next door neighbor intends on taking Charley down and taking his girlfriend away from him and making her a Vampire. That's when things got interesting.

Course, this ain't the 1985 film...it's the 2011 remake(reimagining, whatever you choose to call it). Basically, The central plot of the movie is, exactly, the same. However, if you're coming into this thinking it's a scene for scene remake of the original, <grins an evil grin> you're in for a real eyeopener.

Take one part From Dusk til Dawn, one part Blade, one part '85 Fright Night(of course) and shake extremely well and the end result is our new 2011 remake. While this movie does have some humorous moments to it, for the most part- it's played seriously with our Vampire, Jerry, being a vicious unfeeling bloodsucking spawn. Heck, even Chris Sarandon(the 1985 film's antagonist) makes an appearance. I really enjoyed it myself.

What I didn't like about the movie, however, is how it gets straight to the point(almost expecting you to know certain things from the '85 film). By the time you get invested and get to know all the characters in the movie, it's over. Maybe it was intended to be this way, maybe not. Either way, I kinda frowned on that aspect.

Otherwise, Fright Night is one of those remakes that does the original proud. There are very few out there in a time of constant remakes that have actually been able to do that. <Thumbs up>",1324080000,,1814,4.709779179810726
4224760,4,B003Y5H5FG,"I went to the theater to see the first Fright Night.  I enjoyed it then.  But what this film has that the other film didn't is David Tennant (the magician) and Sandra Vergara (his assistant).  They really were top notch in their give and take in their scenes together and their characters really came alive on the screen.  I think if the story had been about the magician and David Tennant had been cast in the lead role, this film would have been a real box office hit.  If you don't rent or buy this film for any other reason, it should be to see these two in action.  Their performances were absolutely priceless.  I should also mention that Christopher Mintz-Passe was great as Charley Brewster's childhood friend, now shunned.  Special effects have come a long way since 1985 and Colin Farrell is chillingly scary right before--and after he mutates.  He positively oozes evil from his pores.

There were several drawbacks to this movie.  The casting of the high school students needed a bit of work--my older teenagers were laughing about how old a number of them looked--and that's not a good sign when you consider that this could have been their target audience. In addition, the script seemed a little sparse.  Otherwise, I would have rated this film higher.",1323993600,,1267,4.709090909090909
4224761,4,B003Y5H5FG,I don't usually care for remakes of 80s horror movies. Cant think of one that was good. This movie surpassed my expectations. The 3d was one of the best ive seen to date. I own every 3d blu ray movie that is avalible with the exception of step up 3d.,1323993600,,250,4.02
4224762,3,B003Y5H5FG,The actors do a nice job of updating the earlier version of this that came out in the 80s.  Farrell and Yelchin are especially good as the vampire and the human neighbor at odds with each other.  The Peter Vincent character is now more like Criss Angel but rather funny.,1323993600,,270,4.38
4224763,1,B003Y5H5FG,"Really don't waste your time, the film has little to no storyline. Little by the way of a script and the effects are average.

4224764,4,B003Y5H5FG,"While there are some who may remember the 1985 horror film ""Fright Night"" written by Tom Holland, and its sequel in 1988, with many remakes of popular horror films happening more and more, what happens if the task of writing a screenplay is given to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" writer Marti Noxon?

Let's just say that while not a horror/slasher type of film, you do get the humor that was quite prevalent in those popular TV series that Noxon was involved with and also the feeling of a homage to the Scooby Gang than redoing the same kind of film that was released in '85.  And director Craig Gillespie doing something different than his previous films ""Lars and the Real Girl"", ""Mr. Woodcock"" and the TV series ""United States of Tara"".

Also, unlike the earlier film's, this latest adaptation would benefit from better visual effects but also a change in storyline compared to the original film.  Where the original focused on a horror fan of the TV series ""Fright Night"" and an actor who played a vampire killer, there are differences that keep the original 1985 film original and this 2011 version is a different type of film that uses the character's names, modernizes the storyline and is essentially a different film.

While the film wasn't a major hit in the box office, it did receive many positive reviews from film critics.  And for fans of ""Buffy the Vampire"" and ""Angel"", because of Noxon's involvement, there was a little homage to those series in the film, as well as to the original film that made fans interested and entertained.  And also to ""Doctor Who"" fans who love David Tennant's work as the doctor and want to see him play the vampire hunter, Peter Vincent.

VIDEO:

""Fright Night"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The Picture quality is fantastic!  There are a lot of detail's that can be seen, from the detail on the clothing, the weapons, the blood on the characters.  Plenty of detail can be seen in this film from Amy's blue eyes, the detail on the CG of Jerry's vampire face, the edges and contour of Peter Vincent's collection and more! Also, it helps to have a talented cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe (""The Others"", ""Twilight: New Moon"", ""The Twilight Saga: Elclipse"", ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") working on the film.  Javier does a wonderful job in capturing the action sequences with complete efficacy!

Skin tones are natural, black levels are deep and no artifacts, banding (especially during the more fire and red intensive scenes) or traces of DNR.  This is an awesome looking film on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Fright Night"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  What an immersive soundtrack!  I was so happy to hear the rear surrounds being used in this film, I was very impressed!  While the film starts out with a lot of dialogue and is crystal clear through the center channel and also ambient effects and music through the front channel, the movie builds with noises from glass being broken, to the scream of Doris but once you get into the action sequences featuring Charley, Amy and his mother being pursued by Jerry, the film becomes immersive!

From the sounds of a motorcycle hitting the back window, Jane running straight into Jerry and the vampire trying to come from below in order to kill his victims or the scrape of metal as it hits the pavement.  From this point on to the film, the film is so immersive because of the continual action sequences that I really enjoyed this lossless soundtrack.  Action kept going and going, ambiance via the club or crowds is heard clearly.  If anything, audio quality like the video is fantastic!

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

While I'm not so fond of '70s and '80s horror films because they still continue to scare the hell out of me... ""Fright Night"" is one of those horror films that may have some scares but by no means is it a horror, slasher film or anything that is overly grotesque.

In fact, when I found out that Marti Noxon wrote the screenplay and that Craig Gillespie was directing, I wasn't thinking of horror film.  Knowing Noxon's style of writing for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the ""Angel"" TV series, she is a writer that tries to bring together comedy, horror but also gives things a more stylish presentation for today's viewers.  While Craig Gillespie is also a character driven director and both working together was actually quite effective.

In some ways, minus Joss Whedon and the fact that fans have wished on a real ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" movie since the TV series had ended, this 2011 version of ""Fright Night"" almost felt like an extension of those series.  A homage to those Whedon TV series that a lot of us grew up watching way before ""Twilight"" and the other countless vampire related films and TV series that are currently ongoing.

And I can easily say that because Marti Noxon wrote the screenplay, was a major incentive of me wanting to watch this film because I knew I was not going to have a bloody horrorfest but a film that will be action-packed and entertaining!  While it will be quite subjective for those who saw the original 1985 film and this 2011 version of which is better and which is not, I'm more on the latter side, that I enjoyed this 2011 film a lot!

First, Colin Farrell does a fantastic job of playing the antagonist, Jerry the vampire.  You know that he is the bad boy that the women are going to fall for and also the actor does a great job of playing the villain!  Anton Yelchin looks like the underdog.  As Charley, a kid we don't expect much from in defending his family, yet himself from a vampire attack, so you root for the underdog.  Especially for his girlfriend Amy (played by Imogen Poots) and his mother Jane (Toni Collette).

But also having David Tennant (which alone will have ""Dr. Who"" fans excited) as the vampire hunter, Peter Vincent was a big plus!  Especially to have Tennant play this bombastic character, so different from Roddy McDowall's 1985 performance.  If anything, Tennant made this rude and aggressive character his own.

But also to having this film set in Las Vegas to help explain the Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter show and also why Jerry has blacked-out windows (because people in Las Vegas work at nights and sleep during the day), works well for this film.

But one advantage that the 2011 version film has its technology and it's talented crew behind it.  Aside from Gillespie and Noxon, for cinematography, you have ""Twilight: New Moon"" and ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe, art director Randy Moore (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", ""The Mask""), costume designer Susan Matheson (""The Kingdom"", ""The Town"", ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""), production designer Richard Bridgland (""Resident Evil"", ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator""), Set decorator K.C. Fox (""Speed"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") and many more.  DreamWorks Pictures really tapped into a talented crew for this 2011 version of the film.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic!  I wish there was an audio commentary but you still get a good number of special features included with this Blu-ray release.  And also, with this Blu-ray release, you get a DVD feature of the film, so since this will be released before Christmas, something people can watch during those long travel commutes or during winter vacation.

Overall, ""Fright Night"" is not so much of a horror film.  If you have watched a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Angel"" episode, you know it's about comedy, its characters and of course, these characters trying to survive from vampires.  While the original definitely had hints of a sequel toward the end, this 2011 film did not. But then again, with so much interest in vampire films and vampire television shows, I wouldn't be surprised if more ""Fright Night"" films would be made.

If so, I hope it retains the same type of vibe as the 2011 version as I do love what Marti Noxon has brought to the original screenplay.  Especially with so many horror films coming out each year, it's great to have something not too banal in which you have a vampire film that is not all about the horror but a screenplay that manages to have fun and not having main characters dying off like other films.

Overall, ""Fright Night"" is an enjoyable, entertaining action-based, vampire film, it may not be scary enough for others...but for those who want to laugh and also enjoy the characters of the film, this one is for you!",1323993600,,9862,4.822724568709102

4224766,2,B003Y5H5FG,"There were some very interesting scenes in the version of 'Fright Night' and this director directed 'Lars and the Real Girl', one of my all time favorite films, but ultimately the movie as a whole was a waste of time and money. Make no mistake this movie is not really a 'remake', it's more of a re-imagining. It has the same characters, but other than Charlie and his girlfriend they have completely lost what made them so endearing to audiences in the first one. Evil Ed is boring, Jerry Dandridge is just a killing machine with no personality to speak of and Peter Vincent was more like Russell Brand in the 'Arthur' movie. I couldn't have cared less about what happened to him. In the original you wanted Peter to win, not only over Jerry but overcome his fears and grow up. That was good writing. This film feels as though the writer had no real affection for the original and just slap dashed something together to make it more 'hip' and current. Big mistake. There is certainly nothing wrong with making it more current, after all it was made in 1984 and the soundtrack and disco scene seem dated. But for God sake why are you trying to fix something that isn't broken? I also suspect that a long list of overpaid studio morons put in their two cents to further complicate matters. So, I'm not surprised at what a mess it was. I should have suspected something when the movie started and I was the only one in the theater.",1323993600,7,1429,4.458015267175573
4224767,5,B003Y5H5FG,"Someone must have said ""Let's make a smart film about the illusion of security in the 21st century, with vampires and 3D arterial bloodspray"" and this Fright Night was born.  Only loosely based on the 30-year-old original, which I imagine is the problem some other reviewers had with it, it invests a fair bit of effort in social critique, a certain amount of attention to its precursors in the vampire genre, and possibly not enough thought in vamp makeup design.  Although, however piranha-faced, this vamp has no angst at all and actually eats people, which is a plus in my book.

The film is worth watching twice, once for the plot and the jump scares, and once for the subtle visual satire--some of the references are so upstaged by the action the penny doesn't drop the first time. (Kudos to Marti Noxon, of Buffy fame, for a script that is just as good, if a lot less quippy, as the Sunnydale adventures.) The pacing is good and the acting is solid in that ensemble-y kind of way; the lighting is a bit dark and the vampire-ember effect is a little cheesy. The film is neither high camp nor retro, so if you are looking for that true 80s experience go watch ""Lost Boys"" or the original ""Fright Night.""

4224791,4,B003Y5H5FG,"In an age of cruddy, needless remakes coming out seemingly every other week, the fact that the Fright Night remake is surprisingly good is quite refreshing indeed.  The basic premise of the original remains the same, as high schooler Charlie (Anton Yelchin) suspects his neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a blood-thirsty vampire when denziens of his Vegas suburb begin to go missing.  Things begin to go from bad to worse as Charlie's mother (Toni Collete) and gorgeous girlfriend (Imogen Poots) get caught in the crossfire, leading him to seek out the assistance of horror illusionist Peter Vincent (David Tennant) as things reach a bloody climax.  Alterations to the original film's story aside, this new take on Fright Night works, and delivers the goods for those looking for real vampire thrills in this age of sparkling teenage vamps that take too much care of their hair.  Colin Farrell acts every bit the predator vamp, and the great David ""Dr. Who"" Tennant steals the whole show here.  While it isn't perfect and leaves a little to be desired (i.e., some of the CGI effects are pretty lame looking), Fright Night is a bloody good time regardless.  All in all, if you're a fan of the original film, check this out, you may find yourself pleasently surprised.",1323907200,,1266,4.892523364485982

I'm a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of the original film. I even sorta like the sequel to it. Its one of the best Vampire movies to have ever been released. That being said, it is pure horror/comedy. Its not 100% serious at times, so if you don't like your vampire/horror films like that you might not enjoy the original. . .

The only thing going for this remake is Colin Farrel as a sexy vampire and unfortunately they didn't play up to that enough, so even he couldn't save the movie from being pretty crappy.

The entire beginning was rushed. Murders had already been happening and ""Evil"" Ed was the one to suspect Jerry from the getgo. Charlie didn't really care about Jerry or Peter Vincent. Their roles really seemed reversed.

This movie just wasn't as fun as the original. And lets not forget the god awful CGI blood used in every shot that there was blood.

Take my advice. Watch the original first!

It took David Tennant to get me to give it a try.

Yes, I know he's the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B000JBWWP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>&nbsp;guy, but while that's what originally brought him to my attention, I've been following his work since, and man is he one talented actor. His portrayal of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamlet/dp/B0038RSJ0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamlet</a>, for instance, was stellar. The man has serious acting chops.

But the screenplay lets him and his otherwise capable co-stars down. Dull, by-the-numbers, and banal action sequences attempt to carry the day through special effects what wit and skilled directing did in the original.

I understand why Tennant did the film. UK television and cinema may be challenging, but American film is where the money's to be had. The man can be a fine actor, but he has to pay his bills like all the rest of us.

That said, he did a capable job here in an otherwise undistinguished film and I'm hoping it leads to better roles for him in the future.

In the meantime ... do yourself a favor and see the original instead. It may be dated, but it's still much better than this mishmash.",1323734400,3,1501,6.231884057971015
4224797,4,B003Y5H5FG,"The remake of the 1985 classic fright night was not only a beautiful high-def transfer, but every actor played their heart out for their rolls in the movie. I can easily say that this is my favorite roll by Colin Farrel because he played a really insane vampire. Anton Yelchin also did great in this movie as a freaked out teenager.

4224798,5,B003Y5H5FG,"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan of re-makes.  If people of a younger generation can't appreciate the brilliance of Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, or even Kevin Bacon in Footloose, then maybe they shouldn't bother. I don't want to compare Fright Night to Rear Window or anything, but this was one of my favorite scary movies growing up. I still love it as an adult, especially now that I can appreciate how sexy Chris Sarandon was. So, needless to say, I was a little wary of this re-make. Then I saw that Marty Noxon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was behind it. Buffy is my all-time favorite television show, so I knew this re-make was definitely worth a gander.

The cast the new Fright Night was another draw. Anton Yelchin is always likable.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse is always funny. Toni Collette is great as Charlie Brewster's mother, and it was a pleasant surprise to have a more aware and present mother in the storyline. Let's also face facts, Colin Farrell is sexy. Add in Vampire Colin Farrell to Marti Noxon's writing and my tickets were purchased five minutes ago.  To put a cherry on the top of that, David Tennant is Peter Vincent. Doctor Freaking Who is in this movie.

In all, this re-make was the best pleasant surprise.",1323734400,,1247,4.624434389140271

4224830,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I saw this movie with high expectations and fortunately I wasn't disappointed!  I really like the original Fright Night with Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell.  Now that was a great combination against each other!  This is a great udate of that movie.  Colin Ferell is a great Jerry Dandridge and he doesn't try to copy the original Jerry.  However, his Jerry is just as vicious and there is no reference to a past love like the original.  This Jerry Dandridge (2011 style) is just plain vicious.  He just wants to suck your blood dry and then throw you out like yesterdays garbage, and better yet he wants to make some victims into Vampires as well.  The scene is not set in Los Angeles like the original, but in Las Vegas.  The hero Charley Brewster (portrayed excellently by Anton Yelchin) is in with the ""cool kids"" of his high school.  Unfortunately, one of his best friends is the geeky ""Evil Ed"" played by Christopher Mintz Plasse who tries to warn Charley that there is something BAD ""in the air"".  Charley's girlfriend is beautiful played by Imogen Poots as Amy.  This time Jerry Dandridge doesn't look at her as a resemblance of a past love, but as a potential Vampire to harass Charlie. Also, this Jerry doesn't have an assistant like the original Jerry did in 1985.
I am sure you all know the details of the movie so I won't get into that.  It is great that Chris Sarandon makes a suprize cameo in the film, unfortunately well...I won't spoil that suprize.  This has great special effects and this time Peter Vincent is alot more bizare than that played by Roddy McDowell.  That is okay because David Tennant plays Vincent with great flourish, though you find out he has a family past with Jerry Dandridge.  Okay, that is all I am going to say about the plot.  Overall, what a great movie this is and I can't wait to watch it over again.  This is a movie for those who like great Vampire Plots, truely spooky scenes, and great special effects makes this a movie that is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1323388800,4,2002,4.544692737430168
4224831,4,B003Y5H5FG,"I'm going to skip directly to my list of likes and dislikes about the movie. Overall it was a fun watch. It wasn't a great movie in any sense of the word since the whole vampire subject has been done and redone over and over thousands of times. This movie did not add anything new, you basically just watch it for the action and the laughs, which were alright.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!

Likes:
- I love how the mom didn't fit into the typical stereotypical skeptical mom role that many movies portray the parents and other adults as. I'll explain. You know how movies have parents and adults being in denial and skeptical when their kids bring up subjects that make the kids seem like they're going crazy? And the parents or adults don't believe them and in the end get killed for it? Like the scene during the movie when the main character explains to his mom about the vampire next door. Now if she opened the door and they got killed for it, you would probably have thrown your hand up in the air and yell out ""aw man, you should've listened to him!"" Thankfully in this movie, even though the mom was skeptical, she does end up trusting her son more and did not open the door. I loved her character overall, she had an enjoyable personality.

- I was glad to see that the main character's girlfriend remained a good person throughout the movie. What gave me skepticism was when the main character and his ex best friend were investigating the disappearance of one of their other friends. His 'past' best friend said how they use to bad mouth her and call her a sl*t behind her back. So my impression was that the main character gave up his identity to hang out with people that are stereotypically portrayed in similar movies as cool, popular people that have a bad, unfaithful, basically not so cool personality deep inside in relation to their opposite counterparts in which there are nerdy or not so cool people that are actually the ones with a more solid personality and morals overall. So throughout the movie, I was predicting that she would cheat on the main guy with the vampire and eventually get killed because of that, I was preparing myself to hate her. However, it never happened and I actually find myself attracted to her in the sense that she was generally a cool girl with a good head on her shoulders. I kept thinking ""wow she's a keeper"". And yes I know how my sentence sounds like but I'm just trying to be straightforward with my thoughts so bare with me.

- I do like the humor and the other characters overall. There were no specifically obnoxious characters or scenes in the movie. Everything possibly negative was toned down or taken out. The movie contained a decent amount of action to make you stay alert. There were no horrendously unbearable obvious flaws.

DISLIKES:

1. I was not too fond of how, about 15 minutes into the movie the ex best friend yells out ""your neighbor is a vampire"". It sort of came out of nowhere, usually movies like these have a period in the movie where they investigate and then it'll be something like ""ahhh haa! Just as I thought, he IS a vampire!"" The main character eventually investigates his ex best friend's house, but it doesn't seem to explain why the guy originally thought the neighbor was a vampire. Like he video taped it but why did he start doing so? It just sort of came out of nowhere. I just felt like it took a bit out of the story. I would have preferred that but am open minded enough to take in what the movie had to offer, just a personal preference.

2. Nothing new added to the whole subject on vampires. The movie was extremely predictable if you think about it. Guys find vampire, vampire tries to kill them, they kill vampire. No good twist or anything. They did remain relatively faithful in terms of vampire weaknesses that you normally see in most vampire movies.

OVERALL:
Fun movie, just nothing new and definitely nothing to ADD to the dying movie industry that seems to lack more and more in creativity and originality. The movie industry that seems to rely too much on remakes or remakes of remakes or ideas that's already been done to death. I gave this movie 4 stars because it entertained me, but overall, it's not a superb movie in any sense of the word. It was watchable, but definitely not memorable. You get a few laughs, you go home, then it's pretty much forgotten. Nothing amazing.",1322438400,,4390,4.513207547169811
4224832,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I won't bother with a recap, because there should be one in the description section. But this movie is totally awesome. Granted, the reason we watched it in the first place was because is has Collin Farrell and David Tennant in it, but it was a lot better than I expected. The vampire Jerry (as played by Collin Farrell) is one of the creepiest vampires I've seen, Farrell does a really good job of playing the totally weird creepy man vibe. It's a great contrast to recent...er...more sparkly takes on the vampire legend. David Tennant as the vampire slayer is... Well I laughed my butt off for the most part.

I don't want to give too much away, but some of the really good parts of this movie are:
The dialogue. It was darkly comedic and highly entertaining.
The vampire. Because he was so awesomely creepy the way a vampire should be, and yet still managed to be sexy.
The action and special effects were really well done, I thought. Though I'm no connoisseur of such things. They entertained me without being too cheesy, which is how I judge them.
Comedic bits were dabbled in all over the place, and I spent half my time cringing (from the suspense bits, not from badness) and the other half laughing. I like a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but still tries to give you a little something extra with the thrills and scares.

So, pretty much, for me, this movie was total win. I really enjoyed it, and I think you will too.",1322179200,3,1443,4.482889733840304
4224833,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I loved the original Fright Night (1985) and owned it for years. Saw it for the first time in the early nineties. I wound up inadvertently giving the DVD away not that long ago, but it definitely held up over the years. I also found it scary as hell, Chris Sarandon was effortlessly sexy, and I really liked Charley, Amy, Evil Ed and even Charley's mom (played by the oft neglected Dorothy Fielding). The nightclub scene is classic.

Now, on to the remake. I was really excited about seeing it because I loved the original story so much. Tom Holland is one of my favorite screenwriters and I always keep an eye out for anything of his. And I ended up loving the remake. I've gone back 5 times to see it in theaters, and I've never done that before in my life.

There are some spoilers in the remainder of my review, so please don't read further if you haven't yet seen this film...
____________________________________________________________________________________________

I find this Fright Night incredibly funny and also scary at the same time. Maybe I scare easily, but so many scenes had me at the edge of my seat, starting with the beginning when Evil Ed visits Adam's house and we see Jerry lurking outside the door. The subsequent chase and Jerry turning Ed into a vampire scared the crap out of me. As did so many scenes thereafter - Charley's rescue of Doris, their escape from Jerry's house, the car chase scene (this one had me at the edge of my seat, clutching my friend who had gone with me to see it the 1st time!) - and I loved Chris Sarandon's cameo. That was awesome - one Jerry sinking his fangs into his predecessor. If only William Ragsdale had shown up in some capacity as well - as a disbelieving neighbor or policeman. Ah, well.

I thought the scene between Jerry and Charley when Charley isn't inviting Jerry in (and Jerry's realization that Charley is deliberately stonewalling him) was incredible. Both Colin and Anton did a fantastic job. The analogous scene in the original (Jerry being invited in by Charley's mother) was also clever. But I enjoyed this scene more.

I really enjoyed the comedic aspects. Colin mixed humor and menace very effectively. I loved the way he paid homage to Chris's Jerry by angrily biting into an apple the first time when Charley goes off to meet Ed at Adam's house, and amusingly biting into an apple a second time when Charley and Doris escape his house. My favorite line: when Charley says ""Jerry? That's a TERRIBLE vampire name - JERRY?"", Ed counters: ""I didn't name him, man. I'm just reporting the FACTS."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse delivered that line perfectly. It's a priceless moment.

I found Colin Farrell incredibly sexy and I've become a fan of his for life. No one else could've pulled off the role of Jerry the vampire the way he did. He is truly in his element. Perhaps best of all, the entire cast seems to having a riotously good time here. Overall - as a true lover of the original Fright Night (one of my favorite movies ever!) - I loved, loved, loved the remake. Every time I watch it, I discover another subtlety that I didn't catch earlier. I like this version of Fright Night better, but for emotional reasons that I can't fully verbalize. I can't wait for the DVD to come out!",1316390400,5,3263,4.626943005181347
4224834,5,B003Y5H5FG,I am a huge Fright Night and Colin Farrell fan so this was a perfect combo. I enjoyed the movie very much. It differs a bit in the plotline from the original version. Chris Sarandon makes a cameo appearance in the film as a motorist who meets an untimely demise.,1316044800,3,262,4.26
4224835,5,B003Y5H5FG,"What a great movie a great mix of violent and scary. Inventive and fun, you'll really enjoy Colin's no nonsense vampire.",1315526400,2,120,4.761904761904762
4224836,5,B003Y5H5FG,"I always loved the original but I find the descriptive ""remake"" of this film woefully inadequate. The characters in FN 2011 are much more well rounded and believable, the script far superior. But in all honesty when I first heard about this my first thought was ""another remake? Really?""

And then I found out David Tennant was in it. Now, Mr. Tennant is known to be a very intelligent man. I just couldn't see him taking this on without good reason. Turns out that reason was the script and the changes in the character of Peter Vincent. Unlike the original Peter Vincent, he isn't playing a part. He is terrified of vampires...and for good reason!

To quote @timegeek, another reviewer, (and I so much agree with this I simply have to share it!) ""Tennant is not only absolutely hilarious, providing the majority of the comedic relief in this film, he also delivers the deepest and most moving scene in the film without uttering a single word. While all the actors really deserve praise, it is David Tennant who really gets the opportunity to shine and put his acting abilities on display in what is, interestingly enough, one of the major roles with the least amount of screen time and earns, what I consider to be, the most outstanding performance in the film. ""

What Marti Noxon has done is not simply retell original screenwriter and director Tom Holland's story. They've rebuilt it from the foundation up. They took the original premise and all but created a whole new verse and cannon. I loved it so much I've pre-ordered it.

And let's hope this heralds the end of sparkly, romantic vampires...I like my vampires to be proper murderous monsters, thank you very much!",1315353600,5,1675,4.726027397260274
4224837,4,B003Y5H5FG,"I have long lamented the fact that vampires, one of the great antagonists of literature and mythology, have been so poorly translated to film.  Since 1922's Nosferatu, you can count the number of good vampire movies on one hand.  What's worse is how the portrayal of vampires has transformed from the embodiment of pure evil, to sympathetic vagabond, and now, sexy hero.

In 1985, before this idiotic evolution, Fright Night was released in theaters.  The movie centered around a high school kid, Charlie, who comes to realize that a vampire, a fellow by the name of Jerry, has moved into the house next door.  When he tries to convince his girlfriend and best friend, they laugh at him.  But his insistence begins to worry them, so they enlist the help of Peter Vincent, an aging star of a recently canceled late night horror show, played by Roddy McDowall (Cornelius from Planet of the Apes).  His friends hope this vampire ""expert"" will prove to Charlie that their neighbor is no creature of the night. When Mr. Vincent realizes Jerry really is a bloodsucker, he eventually helps Charlie exterminate the creature.  Chris Sarandon (Prince Humperdinck of ""The Princess Bride"") gives a great performance that is both charming and malevolent as the evil neighbor.  The movie is a little dated, with 80s styles and music, but it's still among the best of the genre.  And it blends humor and horror as well any film ever has.

The folks over at DreamWorks apparently felt this formula would work again in 2011. And since Hollywood is loathe to produce original material these days, a remake was in order.  This remake works largely because of timing.  In an era where vampires have become cute, misunderstood teen idols, audiences are ready for vampires who are just ruthless monsters, unencumbered by guilt or angst over their existence.

The new Fright Night takes place in Las Vegas; an ideal place for a vampire to blend in because of its transient population that works all night and sleeps all day.  Overall, the remake has a superior cast.  Colin Farrell takes over as the not so friendly neighbor, Jerry.  Although I think he's a good actor, I have to say that I have long suffered from an acute case of Colin Farrell fatigue caused by his appearance in one out every three movies released from 2002-2006.  But Farrell is up to the challenge.  His Jerry is a sadistic and unrelenting killer.  He lacks the elegance and panache of Sarandon, but is every bit as charming.  Anton Yelchin (Chekov in the new Star Trek) plays Charlie, a kid who is trying hard to distance himself from his nerdy past and nerdy friends in order to win the affection of a pretty girl.  This time, Peter Vincent is a Vegas magician and narcissistic drunk hilariously brought to life by David Tennant (Doctor Who).  The movie has a few good scares and more than few good laughs.  If I was a movie critic, I would say it's ""wickedly funny.""

Fright Night moves fast, running from scene to scene, rarely slowing down for anything, which is too bad because its best scenes happen when the movie slows down to build the tension.  One such scene occurs when Jerry tries and tries to get a suspicious Charlie to invite him into the house.  Another when Charlie attempts to rescue one of Jerry's victims.  But the movie prefers a sprinters pace, so it can feel a little rushed at times.  There is also a few scenes with annoying CGI blood that's squirts at the camera intended for the 3D version.  But none of this keeps Fright Night from being a highly enjoyable date movie, quite possibly the most fun I've had at the theater this year.  And probably one of the best vampire movies ever, but that's not saying much.",1315267200,48,3689,4.690513219284603
4224838,3,B003Y5H5FG,"To remake the original Fright Night, widely considered a fan favorite by both horror fans and non-fans alike, is a difficult endeavor to accomplish.  The original was cleverly done, but had subject matter gravitas when good eventually met evil.  Fright Night redux, while a decent movie in its own right, fails in this regard, instead making a slicker, hipper version that takes advantage of contemporary actors who, for the most part, don't fill the shoes of their predecessors.  Both stories are essentially the same: A vampire named Jerry (Sarandon (1985)/Farrell (2011)) moves into a quiet neighborhood right next to Charley Brewster (Ragsdale/Yelchin), a teenage boy whose girlfriend is out of his league (Bearse/Poots), and best friend nicknamed Evil (Geoffreys/Mintze-Plasse) is the quintessential nerd.  Charley seeks the help of his friends, family, and famous vampire killer Peter Vincent (McDowall/Tennant) to stop Jerry from sucking the town dry.

A character comparison between the two movies is unfair.  None of the actors save Imogen Poots is an upgrade to the former.  Colin Farrell broods and delivers lines slowly, but he lacks the sophistication of Chris Sarandon.  Mintze-Plasse can never shake off the McLovin moniker, and is a far cry from the oddity that was/is Stephen Geoffreys (who, judging from his IMDB page, now holds the camera for male-on-male adult films).  Yelchin is a fine young actor, but doesn't exude the spineless jellyfish that made Ragsdale's performance so perfect.  And to compare David Tennant to Roddy McDowall is downright offensive.  With that said, the film did have some upside.

The story deviations allow for a sequel with bite, but without completely desecrating a film so many love.  A minor modification with one character's back story, a much quicker entry into the second act and subsequent tension (nearly no build up or character development, just straight into vampire huntin'), and an interesting extension to vampire lore without getting all glittery and sparkly, all help the remake's uniqueness.  Sort of.  While Sarandon may have been more sinister, there is no doubt that Farrell looks more dangerous.  Farrell's version of Jerry is one that doesn't look prissy, just stalking prey with the famed seduction skills of vampires; instead, lethally quick attacks and superhuman strength serve as killing instincts ferocious enough to get a National Geographic voiceover.  It may be cultural, or a sign of the times, but all the characters except McLovin are tougher, edgier, and can realistically be thrown into a confrontation.

Naturally, the special effects were vastly improved.  Expected.  I'm not a big fan of 3D, and the add-ons for this film appear to be monetarily driven (read: minimal and underwhelming), so I am fairly certain the 2D version of this film will suffice.  Having said that, there is plenty of blood splatter, stakes through the heart, and human-to-vampire-to-human transformation to distance this film from the original.  Avoiding the cheesy bat from the original was a big upgrade.

Overall I was entertained but not overwhelmed.  Much better than other blasphemous remakes that have been made in recent years (looking at you Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan), but still lacking originality or a true reason for the remake.",1315180800,4,3306,5.289272030651341
4224879,2,B003Y5H5FG,"Going into the remake of ""Fright Night"", I was a bit apprehensive. The original is my favorite vampire film of all time and I just felt that deep down they were going to find some way to mess up the remake. Then the trailers came in (everything looked solid, if a bit underwhelming), then the reviews came in (75% in just about perfect for a horror film), and then the reaction from fans came in--They didn't mess it up! I couldn't wait to watch the remake. I sat down in my seat eager for the movie to start as I put on my 3D glasses and was ready for the wild vampire ride to begin.

The film starts quite promising. We are given a skyline shot of houses in the suburb. The kind of suburb where everyone owns the same car, the same house, and the same two kids. And then BAM, three killings before the opening credits can even hit the screen. I was ready! This is going to be the remake to end all remakes! Sadly, it was not to be. The plot is generally the same as the original with a few small changes. Teenager Charley Brewster guesses that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire responsible for a string of recent deaths. When no one he knows believes him, he enlists Peter Vincent, a self proclaimed vampire killer and Las Vegas magician, to help him take down Jerry.

What doesn't work about this movie? Well, aside from a few stylish touches...pretty much everything. Gone is the old, charming horror host Peter Vincent and in is a Midori chugging whorish magician. Ugh. Gone is the beautiful shot and exciting club scene in which Jerry seduces Charley's girlfriend Amy (it's here, but the less said about the ""new"" version of this scene the better). Gone is Jerry's homo-erotic relationship with his best ""friend""/roommate. Hell, that character isn't even IN this film. What's added? Awful CGI (Amy's vampire scene with Charley is incredibly lame and doesn't look half as good as it did in the TWENTY FIVE year old original) and a final battle scene that belongs more to ""Underworld"" than it does to the ""Fright Night"" legacy. That being said, It's worth a rental at least. The movie wasn't so much bad as it was incredibly disappointing. I felt there was so much more they could have done with the premise. What a waste.",1315094400,9,2237,4.493857493857494
4224880,4,B003Y5H5FG,"The Review:

Hollywood is recycling movies, cranking out remakes, reboots and prequels so fast that Fright Night is just one of TWO remakes released in the same week in August. But unlike the Conan reboot, Fright Night hits it out of the park. I confess to never having seen the original Fright Night, so I'm a tabula rasa so far as preconceptions of what Fright Night should be. I can't tell you how well the new Fright Night stands up to the original. What I can tell you is that this new Fright Night alternates perfectly between funny and thrilling. Starring Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, Imogen Poots, David Tennant and Toni Collette, Fright Night is long on talent and short on filler. It moves at a brisk pace until it turns on pacing afterburners (in a good way!) about halfway through.

Anton Yelchin plays Charley Brewster. He and his single mom, Jane, played by Toni Collette live in Las Vegas and in a nod to the real world the economy is weak resulting in dozens of foreclosed, empty houses. So when whole families disappear from the neighborhood, it's only natural to think that the former occupants fell on hard economic times and lost the family home. But Charley's best friend, Ed, knows better. Ed knows that all the missing kids at school and empty houses in town are the work of Vampires. Queue Jerry, played by Colin Farrell. He's Charley and Jane's new next door neighbor. Y'know, a guy who works nights and sleeps during the day. A lot of people work nights at Vegas casinos. Besides, a vampire named Jerry? That's like naming a vampire Bill, Erik or Pam

Well just like Erik Northman, Jerry is of the species homo vampiricus badassicus. He will not be throwing pebbles at your window and sharing chaste kisses with you in the woods. He will however, be flipping your car over and trying to disembowel you. Colin may be the scariest character named Jerry in all film history. At the start of the movie it's a quite, subtle menace, but it isn't long before Jerry cuts loose and the movie shifts gears from fun comedy to all out thrill ride. Fright Night, like 30 Days of Night reminds us that vampires need not be angst ridden and insecure. They EAT PEOPLE! And it's awesome.

I don't know whether Fright Night is a good remake, but it is a great movie. It is full of laughs but has fantastic thrills too. After seeing what vampires named Jerry are capable of, let's all of us hope what happens in Vegas truly stays in Vegas.

I am an 80's baby, so I grew up a big fan of this movie, and if it were left up to me personally I don't think they should have even bothered with a remake. Remakes only show how unoriginal and uncreative Hollywood has become. With that said, let's discuss what I didn't find interesting, and that's the angle they took with this Peter Vincent. While I appreciate that they tried to make him a modern day version of Roddy McDowell let's keep it real. This guy was more like a rock star than a vampire hunter, real or fake, in my own opinion. You barely see this guy besides on television, and when Charlie finally looks the guy up he does absolutely nothing besides run and hide until the end of this movie. The other Peter Vincent had a more active role in finding out about who Jerry Dandrige really was and helping Charlie defeat him even though he was afraid in the original film. I also have a slight problem with the ""Evil Ed"" they had this time around. Come on, how in the hell can they arrange it to where he finds out about Jerry before Charlie because he's been following Jerry around town with night vision goggles and camcorders. Is that the best they could come up with? That part was not believable to me that ""Evil"" would just know to follow Jerry because he is a vampire and then warn Charlie about it only to be bitten in practically the beginning of the movie. There was really no build up to that point, Ed just knew about Jerry, and it just is what it is I guess. Frankly, and it's just my opinion, but I don't think that part was thought out too well. On top of that, I guess they totally decided to axe Jerry's daytime companion and watchdog that was Jonathan Stark in the original movie. I really hate to be the person that only dewells on the original because I dislike it when other people tend to harp on that fact. Plus, it only makes it harder to accept the new characters and storylines, but by this being one of my favorites it was very important to me that it was done right, and in my opinion it fell short in certain areas. In the original film Charlie's curiosity and spying is what got him in hot water with Jerry.

Now, let's discuss what I did find interesting, and that is I liked the brief Chris Sarandon cameo. I liked the fact that Charlie's mom played a bigger role in this film because you barely remember that she is a part of the story in the first film because her screen time and dialogue was very short. I also think that Colin Farrell made a worthy vampire because he was all about the killing. It's not secret that the man is extremely easy on the eyes, so the sexiness oozes from his pores without him even trying to be sexy, but I do think they tried to make him more terrifying than seductive which is rare for vampires these days. I sort of like the Amy better than Amanda Bearse this time around, but I couldn't help but think she didn't have a real role in this movie besides playing the hot piece of tail in this movie. The original Amy was more involved in the meat of the story than this chick.

Overall, the movie did seem a bit rushed, but it was fun to watch. I think that if you don't the mistake of doing what I did, and that was constantly trying to see some type of resemblance to the first film then you will like it.",1314662400,22,3569,4.23935389133627
4224883,3,B003Y5H5FG,"What the world needs now is hardly another Vampire Movie.

For the duration of this millenium our cultural channels have stuffed with fanged bloodsuckers. Precocious, teenaged vampires direct from central casting, Beverly Hills 90210. Leather-clad, Matrixey cyber-vampires. Cute, oscar-winning child-stars growing up and fighting vampires in the deep south. Dystopian, fractured society vampires from Sweden. Vampire spoofs. It's all been done, literally to death. In recent times none, I would argue, summon up a tenth of the gothic splendour of Dracula or Nosferatu. Yet still they come.

Just when you thought the genre really had been sucked dry, there comes Fright Night. Fresh blood? Well, it's a remake. You're getting a bit ""meta"" if that could count as a novel angle. And, anyway, it can't: Dracula has been remade so many times even he's lost count: talk about undead.

Colin Farrell and his cohorts, if they are striving for something new and not just trying to catch the last sparks of a departing comet, have their work cut out. Fright Night is a comedy horror: a genre neither fish nor fowl that was popularised in the eighties by films like - well, Fright Night.

What they present is: fine. If this were performance appraisal, I'd say ""meets expectations. Good corporate citizen, safe pair of hands, nice approachable chap, collegiate, talented, works hard. Escalates appropriately.""

It's well acted, edited and scripted. Farrell enjoys himself; Dr. Who`s David Tennant has a ball as a louche and pathetic vampire hunter. It's moderately funny (largely when those two are on screen), but not uproarious. But it isn't tense, is never frightening, and has the sex appeal of a dentist's waiting room.

And that, in a 2011 vampire movie, isn't enough.

As we walked home, we saw a Bugatti Veyron was parked outside a local hotel. Seeing that was a kick. Seeing Fright Night wasn't. Now you don't need to be a Veyron to turn heads, but if, in late 2011, you want to make a splash as a vampire movie, you can't be a Mondeo. Fright Night is a Mondeo. Excellently designed, brilliantly supply chained, well constructed, reliable, and okay. No-one's dream car, though, and certainly no-one's idea of a nightmare.

Much of the film feels like it is going through the motions. The genre has a well determined sequence: Charley, our hero (Anton Yelchin) stumbles on a villain's grim secret. No one will believe him. He warns his friends but they are seduced by the bad guy. They vilify and reject him. Villain flourishes. Seemingly too late, his message gets home. Cue final reel: wall-to-wall zombie killing. This exposition is rushed. Charley's mother (Toni Collette), a single mom, has a golden opportunity to flirt with hunky vamp (Farrell) who's moved next door. But she doesn't.

Other opportunities for cleverness are skipped: in early exchanges Charley's improbably foxy girlfriend (the pretty but, er, bloodless Imogen Poot) picks up a copy of Wuthering heights from his bedside table and flips through it wantonly. They discuss it briefly (him: it's boring. Her: oh, no: it's quite sexy). Cue an extended riff about Wuthering Heights, right? Farrell as Heathcliff (you could even get in some knowing digs about Colin Firth)? Wrong. Wuthering Heights is tossed aside and gets no further mention.

As we wandered home wondering out loud about what commercial (let alone artistic) imperative led them to make this film, why they didn't make more of Wuthering Heights, it struck me that what they could have done is just done Wuthering Heights, set in Vegas hinterland (the way Emma was done LA style in Clueless). That would have been cool: it is a cool story, and one which hasn't been filmed recently, as far as I can recall.

Oh well: opportunity missed.

Eventually he discovers he is a vampire and his girlfriend is the next victim, so he recruits peter vincent to hunt down and kill the vampire. Had some interesting ideas, but what hurts the movie is its crude dialogue and over use of the F word and whatever else spoken obsanity thats written for a teenage audience, its unnessary. Peter Vincent isn't likeable and its disrespectful towards Roddy Mcdowalls original performance. Evil Ed had the worst performance and dialogue, Colin Farrell is the strongest performance and what made the movie.

4224885,5,B003Y5H5FG,"Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager living in Las Vegas, Nevada with his mother (Toni Collette). Their new neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell), is a mysterious man who works all night and sleeps during the day. As Charley leaves for school with his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots, you're reading this name correctly), his mother comments about the dumpster sitting in front of Jerry's yard. Charley pays little attention to it. Once at school, Charley is approached by his former friend `Evil' Ed (Christopher Mintze-Plasse) who believes that Charley's new neighbor is a vampire. People have been turning up missing in the area and a woman was recently attacked by a man who tried to bite her. Ed is convinced, but Charley is unable to accept that the charismatic man next door could possibly be a vampire and dismisses Ed's ramblings. When Charley eventually becomes suspicious himself, his research yields that Ed's claims were correct. Intending to keep his mother and girlfriend safe, Charley enlists the help of a magician and self-proclaimed vampire expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant) to help him destroy Jerry before Jerry destroys everything around him.

This summary may sound vaguely familiar, because Fright Night is the latest example of the Hollywood remake machine remaking every film they can. Based on a 1985 film that already spawned a 1988 sequel and is considered one of the better horror films of that decade, this film takes a different approach in remaking a film that some consider a classic and is more of a reimagining than a remake. Fright Night respects the source material enough to not just create a carbon copy of it, retaining the tone/concept of Tom Holland's original rather than the specifics of the plot. The chronology of the story has been altered, with events from the original taken out and new ones put in and the film has done away with certain elements of the original story. Meanwhile, some returning characters have retained their basic function in the plot but have been completely reimagined. Obviously, this has a much more modern feel but that doesn't mean it's the studios attempt to appeal to Twilight fans. The original is very much a product of the 1980s, while this latest version is very much a product of the 2010s. In updating it this way, it simply continues staying true to the original film. It's rare to see a Hollywood remake stick so close to the source material while straying so far from it and it's even rarer when the old story is replaced with a new one of equal strength. The idea of rewriting Fright Night as opposed to copying the original by-the-numbers, works for and against this new version. The 1985 film has its cult following and fans will be angered that the remake (exists and) has strayed from their beloved original. Meanwhile, open-minded people who come to this film without bias will appreciate the feeling that they're seeing a new film. As a remake, Fright Night is a worthy one. Taken on its own terms, it's very good film too. This is the surprise of the summer.

The 2011 Fright Night is better than the 1985 Fright Night that inspired it. While it lacks some of what made the original special and does away with elements that made some audiences interpret it as something deeper than a typical-horror/comedy, it improves upon the imperfections of the original substantially and has few imperfections of its own. The character `Evil' Ed, as played by Stephen Geoffreys in 1985, met with polarized reactions. On one hand, the character was a fan favorite and considered one of the best aspects of the film, but, on the other hand, he's considered by many (including this viewer) to be one of the most annoying characters to ever grace the screen. It wasn't the character, but the performance that elicited such strongly opposed reactions. It succeeds only in that it's memorable, but few performances have made me so frustratingly annoyed. Roger Ebert called Pauly Shore the ""cinematic equivalent of long fingernails, drawn very slowly and quite loudly over a gigantic blackboard."" This describes how I feel about Geoffreys. While Mintze-Plasse doesn't create a performance as memorable and his `Evil' Ed character (only referred to by the moniker once) is substantially altered, he's immediately less annoying and has much less screen-time. Mintze-Plasse is forever cursed to be remembered as McLovin', but he uses that to his advantage by allowing the audience to make their associations and then going somewhere different with the character. This is the darkest he has gone with a performance and it works. In the 1985 version, Amy was much more of an object of desire for both Charley and Jerry, but was played by Amanda Bearse, the actress best known as Marcy D'Arcy from Married...With Children. While Amy is more personally involved in the plot this time, her character is not lusted over to the extent she was in 1985. I like Bearse, but she was not convincing as the object of a teenager's desire let alone a much older vampire. The new Amy is much more attractive and convincing than Bearse was. The only thing this new version is missing that the old version really benefitted from was Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent. McDowall was the highlight of the original film and made Vincent such a sympathetic character. I do miss McDowall, although David Tennant plays a completely remodeled version of the character and does a splendid job, but more on that later...

The script by Marti Noxon (with a story credit going to Tom Holland, who is also credited with the `based on' portion leading me to think he may have had some involvement with this new story) is very well-written, with a strong respect and debt to the original film. The comedy/horror tone is preserved, but the time-specificity is updated well without becoming too overbearing with current pop-culture references. Some characters, such as Jerry's assistant, are done away with but characters like Amy and Charley's mom are much more developed and involved this time around. I applaud Noxon for rewriting Peter Vincent successfully, as I had very little hopes when I heard what was done with the character. Additionally, Noxon stays true to the characters, which was very important in the original film. People, myself included, felt emotionally invested in their plight and that remains true here.

Fright Night is paced very well and draws you in, but descends into a CGI-heavy action film towards the end of the second act. It's obligatory for a film like this and it doesn't sacrifice the story or characters for the sake of mindless special effects, but the story is most successful when it deals with character interactions. The early scenes, especially the new ones, are marvelously handled. The scene where Charley first enters Jerry's home is suspenseful and exciting, with a surprisingly shocking climax. It's a great-looking film, which I can't emphasize enough. The film was shot in 3D, but the entire thing looks wonderful with some incredible exterior shots (which I suspect are CGI). Director Craig Gillespie currently has a track record of one well-received and one horribly-received film, but he proves here to be quite the director. Finally, the score by Ramin Djawadi is an effective film score that complements the action onscreen very well.

The acting, for both a horror film and remake, is very impressive. Yelchin is a convincing Charley and it's easy to really relate to the character and the situation he's found himself in. David Tennant plays Peter Vincent for the first several minutes as a Criss Angel/Russell Brand hybrid, but eventually transitions the character into someone the audience can root for. He establishes a completely different persona from McDowall yet stays true to the heart of the character and gives a very entertaining performance. The real star however is Farrell as the smokingly charismatic, diabolical Jerry. Clearly having a lot of fun here, devouring the scenery with a performance that is unbelievably charismatic and effectively creepy, Farrell brings flamboyancy to the role, treating it seriously without being afraid to have fun with it. Think of Heath Ledger as the Joker basically, although don't expect Farrell to collect any awards. It's absolutely fascinating to watch him and it restores faith in an actor that hasn't had such a prominent role in the limelight for the last few years.

Also featuring a terrific ""Hey-I-know-that-dude"" cameo from an original player in the 1985 version, Fright Night is a tense, intense, and very entertaining film that goes far and beyond expectations; a fine example of a remake and a sturdy film on its own. It's never dull, it delights in over-the-top blood and gore, and it never takes itself too seriously. While it's not quite a ""horror"" film and it's contrivances keep it from being perfect (much like the original), I can't imagine seeing a more enjoyable horror film this year.

GRADE: A-

*Due to theatre manipulation, I was forced to see the film in 3D. If you like 3D to be gimmicky, there were moments that were quite impressive. However, due to many scenes being very dark it doesn't benefit from this format in any discernible way.",1314057600,13,9223,4.976653696498055
4224886,4,B003Y5H5FG,"This film was a very good horror film remake that follows the ""How to Make a Re-make"" handbook nicely. It's a simple rule really. Take the basic premise of the film you are re-making, keep basic elements the same, and then make your own damn movie! Think about it. Some of the best horror film remakes in recent memory (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, Piranha) all follow this rule. They pay ""respects"" to there origins, but for the most part are farely original. This one is no different.

The story is about a high school boy named Charlie, who recently has climed the social ladder at school with help from his new friends, who are tools, and his smokin'-hot girlfriend. But when his new neighbor Jerry moves next door, all hell breaks loose. You see, Jerry (played wonderfully macho by Colin Farrell) is a vampire hell-bent for blood who will do anything it takes to get it. But when Charlie recieves help from his girlfriend and his new found magician friend Peter Vincent (played like a cross between Chris Angel and Aldous Snow), Jerry might have more on his plate then he can handle.

All in all, this was a very refreshing and suprising remake that deliciously blends humour with horror. If you're looking for a good scare with some dark comedy and a well ensembled cast, this is the movie for you.",1314057600,10,1318,4.604255319148936
4224887,4,B003Y5H5FG,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  As a big fan of the original, I thought, ""not again.""  But dang, this is GOOD.  It really works hard to keep the same light-hearted tone of the original while updating the story quite nicely.  I mean, things have changed a lot in the last 25 years and if you want to make a story like this work, it's either a period piece or modern day, that's it.  The cast is great. Farrell is so freaking sexy mean that he reminds you of what a vampire is supposed to be. This has some fun FX, good laughs, a few decent scares and great cinematography and music.  The source material is obviously well-regarded by the filmmakers.  Sad, though, there were only about 20 people in the theater when I saw this.  Most were easily over 35.  The new vampire fans don't seem to be interested and it's a shame.",1313971200,2,834,4.261146496815287
4224888,4,B003Y5H5FG,"When one takes a look at vampires in the media these days, it's a wonder any of them manage to stand out.  Considering how many stories feature romanticized bloodsuckers, or ones that sparkle in sunlight instead of turning to ash, it's such a delight to get a film that gives us charming, but exceedingly dangerous vampires who aren't afraid to seduce you and those you love before sinking their fangs into your flesh.

""Fright Night"" follows the story of Charley, a typical teenager living out in Las Vegas with his mother.  Life is simple:  he goes to school, has geeky friends, and a nice girlfriend.  But when his classmates start disappearing, Charlie soon realizes that a man named Jerry, while charming and handsome, is actually a vampire who's out to suck as much blood as he can, and has set his sights on the people Charlie cares about most.  The only problem?  Jerry happens to be Charley's neighbor.

What makes ""Fright Night"" so effective is that it's an effective blend of horror and action.  While there's plenty of stabbings, shootings, and stuff getting thrown about, there's also some very effective horror moments:  Jerry is a charming and charismatic, but at the same time, he's different from other classic vampires in that while some of the traditional anti-vampire charms work, others don't, which lends the film a good sense of tense mystery, as we don't know what, if anything, will harm or kill Jerry.  And while the action and horror compliment each other really well, and carry the film from beginning to end, there is a nice dash of humor to be found in David Tennant's performance of Peter Vincent, a stage performer who's a great mix of charisma and over the top theatrics.

Overall, ""Fright Night"" is a refreshing take on the Vampire mythos:  With it's strong cast, effective blend of horror and action, and a touch of mystery, it makes for a surprisingly well done film, and a breath of fresh air in a genre that's been sucked dry by vampire overload.",1313971200,5,1984,4.7492711370262395
