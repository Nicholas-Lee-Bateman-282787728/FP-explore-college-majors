8390709,4,B0037PFHK8,"Great set of instruction for dealing with specific situations,my only knock is the dvds work in some of my players but not in others and all instructional material needs a menu.",1424563200,,177,4.741935483870968
8390710,5,B0037PFHK8,"Excellent videos, very good material to practice, the instructors are very professionals.",1404604800,,89,6.5
8390711,4,B0037PFHK8,"The dvd set Urban Krav Maga is a good basic instructional set, the technigues are a little more gentle than some of the Krav Maga I've seen in the past which can be a good thing because of legal risks resulting from defending ones self, in jujitsu they have self defense style jujitsu, sport jujitsu and then they have combat jujitsu, I would rate this a self defense level of Kava Maga with some good tequniques and some that were just okay. I would recommend this set to the average person needing to learn some good solid techniques with the thought of not seriously harming the attacker.",1346630400,2,591,4.5327102803738315
8390712,5,B0037PFHK8,"I had a problem with the region coding on these dvd's. I contacted Mr. McGill and he offered to exchange the disc and reimburse me for postage. That is how strongly this man stands behind his product. As for the content itself I would say it is in a class of its own. If you are going to buy a self defense dvd set any time soon this is the one to get. I am not trained in traditional krav maga so I don't really know first hand what I am talking about here. But from what I have seen of it I think it can be over the top on violence. These techniques I believe will keep you safe and out of court. Also they are not dependent on fist punching which is a definite plus for me. I am 42 yrs. old and my hands are giving me a lot of aches and pains from years of abuse. The knife defense portion of the videos is some of the best(if not the best) I have ever seen. The gun defense portion looks to me a LOT like commando krav maga, which is o.k. for me as that is one area of C.K.M. that I actually liked. The rest of C.K.M. looks like watered down ju-jitsu, but that is a whole different subject. There are a few minor things about this system that I did not like but as it is dvd home training I can modify them as I see fit. One example is how he holds his hands in defense of guns and knives, but I don't have to do it this way. On one final note I wish he had a section on stick/baseball bat defenses but I guess you cant have everything.",1301788800,7,1440,3.8518518518518516
