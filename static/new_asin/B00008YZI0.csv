Key figures in this transition are Margaret Thatcher, in Britain, and Ronald Reagan in the U.S.. A very enlightening account of how important ideas (especially economic ones) shape our social structure (Hegelian ideational dialectic in contrast to Marxian materialist dialectic). A must view.",1453161600,,442,5.611940298507463
7988244,5,B00008YZI0,"Very Good series of programs, that teach how the things happened to transform our world into the one we have today. Besides the documentary was made in 2001, it's a good way to learn from the past. The only downside is it duration: almost 1,5h per episode",1276905600,2,255,4.446808510638298
