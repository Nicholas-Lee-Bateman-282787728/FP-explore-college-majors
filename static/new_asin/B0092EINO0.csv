5243216,5,B0092EINO0,"I watched this to practice my French, and didn't expect more than light entertainment, but this was a lovely humanistic movie that went beyond the sit-com I was expecting. Even the small parts were three-dimensional. There were lots of well-done small moments, and wonderful warm humor throughout. It didn't insult the viewer's intelligence. Well worth watching.",1424476800,4,362,5.482142857142857
5243217,5,B0092EINO0,"How one can see oneself and how others can see you if they believe you are from one country(Italy) and not from another(Algeria). Despite all the efforts one can made to conceal one true's identity, at the end,  it is more important to be TRUE to oneself. The Truth will set one free for sure.",1358726400,,293,4.327272727272727

8534725,5,B0092EINO0,"What can I say about Kad Merad that probably hasn't already been said. He is fantastic, heartfelt, warm, and knows how to captivate. This movie played a close part to my heart. Being a Muslim American (Persian/American) born and raised in the states, this really hit home. It took me back to my religious roots and left me thinking days after. Would def recommend and watch over and over again.",1465084800,2,394,4.642857142857143
