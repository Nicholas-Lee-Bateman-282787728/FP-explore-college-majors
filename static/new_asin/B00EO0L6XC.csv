5929395,4,B00EO0L6XC,"I like heist flicks. The planning. The near perfect execution. The charismatic bad guys going up against the well schooled good guys. This has it all and it's a good outing.

Here's the scoop. Bruce Reynolds (Luke Evans) is on the cusp of becoming a big time crook. He plans well but the reward hasn't equaled the effort. He figures to change that with his next job; the robbing of a mail train. He plans and recruits. The heist goes off and now the ""Flying Squad"" wants his head on a platter.

This is a two part series. In the first part deals with meeting Reynolds and his recruits. You see them plan the job and execute it. The second part deals with the aftermath as the ""Flying Squad"", a special investigative force within Scotland Yard, puts together clues to bring these blokes to justice. It's quite well done. As this is set in 1963 the opening shows a very hip London with cool tunes, clothes and overall positive attitude. It does settle down after that to the nuts and bolts of the planning and execution. The devil is in the details and it's interesting to see all the attention paid by these guys to pull this off. Of course there are snags during the heist and the team needs to improvise but that is where things get exciting.

Then is part two. We meet Tommy Butler (Jim Broadbent) a humorless and focused individual who is a hard task master. He pushes his team to the limit. But little by little the tiny pieces fall into place. This is all done well. The methods and thoughts by all on completing their perspective tasks is worth seeing. Some things might not be new to fans of the genre but some surprised me a lot. This is all very clever. And I liked the characters. This isn't what we're used to seeing in similar flicks. The bad guys aren't thuggish and the good guys have little if any charisma. It's all very 'by the book.'

The period depiction is spot on. The clothes, the nifty 60s Jazz score and locations draw the viewer into the time and place. The performances are all top shelf, while the plot displays little in the way of histrionics. They didn't feel the need to make more of it than it was. This was based on a true story so I'm not certain how much punching up it needed to get to the screen but I found it satisfying.

If heist/cat and mouse flicks are your poison, this should be a feast for you.",1423008000,3,2339,4.34324942791762
5929396,4,B00EO0L6XC,"In this purchase you get two DVD's reflecting that this production first appeared as a television series. It's very well done - excellent acting, pacing and cinematography. You won't fall asleep watching this work.

What I found problematic was screenwriter Chris Chibnail's pathetic attempt to justify/excuse/glorify adultery. There are two protagonist/heroes in this series, since the story is told from two different perspectives. The robbery mastermind, Bruce Reynolds, played by Luke Evans, is one protagonist, and though a criminal he is elevated to hero status, in part, by being portrayed as a young, virile, faithful husband and adoring father. His wife also sticks by him through thick-and-thin. The other protagonist is acting heavyweight Jim Broadbent who plays the chief detective named Tommy Butler. Broadbent is elevated to hero status through being portrayed as dogged, tough, clever, and wise. Now, obviously a wise man can't have a stupid marriage, so Butler is portrayed as sensitive to his lifelong spouse - we never see her except in a photograph -, but who nonetheless has no problem, despite his age (late sixties at least), having a bi-weekly affair with a younger woman.

Now, if faithfulness to his wife is needed to glorify criminal Reynolds, why does unfaithfulness to wife not demean detective Butler? Simple - we get lots of sympathetic exposure to Reynolds's wife in this series - she is in many scenes and we come to admire her as a wife and mother; she becomes real to us. We get no exposure to Butler's wife, none at all expect a tiny out-of-focus woman in a photograph. We are not sympathetic to her; she is not real to us.

By employing this ruse screenwriter Chibnail proves that adultery is wrong - he proves that when we relate to a woman and wife as a real flesh and blood human being it is wrong to betray her. Chibnail cannot, therefore allow us to know/relate to Butler's wife who must be a wonderful person to be so long married to such a fine man and heroic detective. If we actually got to know Butler's wife, we would despise Butler for cheating on her. So Chibnail employs a cheap theatrical stunt to excuse adultery, probably because Chibnail is an adulterer himself.",1417910400,,2216,4.904

5929398,5,B00EO0L6XC,"Great.  A Robber's Tale more exciting.  A Copper's tale good, but I agree Jim Broadbent stared too much.  I think more attention should have been given to Ronnie Biggs part, but that's just me.  I bought the movie & it's subtitled which is great because you miss a lot without it, but even if you can't understand all the Brits words, it's still a good time. Liked everything in Robber's Tale.  Liked most everything in Copper's Tale except Butler dying so soon after he caught everybody.  Was his Mum still alive when he passed?",1414800000,2,529,4.574468085106383
5929399,5,B00EO0L6XC,"I loved this story even though in 1963 when the real robbery happened in England I was in HS and oblivious. Nor did I read Rob Ryan's or Andrew Cook's books which were used for this adaptation. Books and TV are different, and the makers of this 2013 ""The Great Train Robbery"" have done well. You get 2 episodes. ""A"" is about the robbery itself as viewed through the eyes of the bandits. ""B"" is the police investigation as seen through their eyes. One continuing story, but 2 perspectives--what a unique way to tell this modern Robin Hood story, as the press liked to push it. Except, they didn't give to the poor, the loot was for themselves.

SDH Subtitles are provided, 1.5 hours for each episode
""A""- A Robber's Tale - Primary character is Bruce (Luke Evans) the gang's leader. All gang members are well played and great characters, each with a role and quirks. That's what is great about the writing. These are not portrayed as stereotype gangsters, just ordinary men who unfortunately take to lawlessness. One is a grocer, one a florist, fathers, etc. They all have flaws, their undoing. They steal 2,631,784 pounds (=41 million today or USA $66.6 million). A HUGE heist. ""Too much,"" as the leader stated. There is action at the end, during the actual robbery, but most of the episode is the mental prep and plot of the robbery job. Period detail in both episodes is fantastic, as the 60s truly looked. I immediately recognized Martin Compston playing a gang member from a recently acquired DVD ""Line of Duty"" where he's a cop. Added is 47 min. of cast interview bonus.

""B"" - A Copper's Tale - Scotland Yard sends in the Flying Squad lead by DCS Butler (Jim Broadbent) tagged as ""One Day"" to make fast work of this high media case. He becomes obsessed, causing conflict with 2nd command DI Williams (Robert Glenister). The task force has 3 tasks: piece together WHAT happened; by WHOM?; WHERE is the cash? It's good TV drama. More action in this 2nd episode. There may be some license taken with facts, those available via Internet, but sit back and truly enjoy this dramatic version of Bad Guys-Good Guys, and perhaps like me find yourself rooting for them all.
Added is 67 min. of cast interview bonus, as fun as the episode.

It is ALMOST a documentary, actually lots more fun than a documentary.",1410393600,6,2305,4.63080684596577
5929400,4,B00EO0L6XC,"Good, but you have to watch both movies to get a taste of what it was  really like. The first movie is from the criminal viewpoint and the second is from Scotland Yard's investigation",1487116800,,183,4.382352941176471

5929403,4,B00EO0L6XC,"In 1963, 75 km (46 miles) north of London, about 17 blokes pinched a train with a coach containing millions of pounds of cash being transported via Her Majesty's Royal Mail. It was the biggest heist in British history in which the perpetrators lifted about 2.6 million (about 50 million in today's money or $80 million). Because of the amount of money which was taken from the British government instead of a private party, an all-out investigation ensued. Eventually, about 2/3rds of the members were arrested and sent to prison. Since the heist many films and references to the heist have appeared in popular culture, including a line in the Beatles' film ""Help"" in which Lennon asks a Scotland Yard detective how the heist investigation is coming.

The current film, a made-for-television miniseries in 2013, is probably the best screen adaption of the heist, presenting the events in two parts. The first is from the point-of-view of the criminals, called ""A Robber's Tale"", and the second from the view of the investigators called ""A Copper's Tale"". Both segments are equally compelling with outstanding actors showing us how the crime is viewed from different sides of the railroad tracks, so to speak. Two sets of casts are used for each segment, until the very end of the second segment in which characters from both segments begin interacting.

Bruce Reynolds (Luke Evans) is the mastermind and leader of the heist. Their first large job, an airport heist in 1962, yields not nearly as much in cash as they had hoped, around 65,000 (about 1.25 million or $2 million today, which seems like a lot of money!). They were hoping for a bigger payoff. Through a tip, they discover a train bound for London from Glasgow, Scotland, contains a coach designated as Her Majesty's Royal Mail. In addition to the typical mail, the car also contains sacks of cash, pound notes probably being taken out of circulation. Reynolds resolves to pilfer the sacks of cash and puts together a team to engage the heist, including someone who claims he can stop trains. They find an old abandoned farm as a temporary hideout. As events play out, the teams hits unexpected twists in their plan, including the amount of money which turns out, like the airport heist, not to be what was expected...

The second part then chronicles the investigation and eventual arrests of members of the heist gang. Tommy Butler (Jim Broadbent) leads the Scotland Yard investigation. Butler is not only shrewd but uncompromising. He decides the best means for a successful apprehension of the criminals is to keep information close to his chest as his second-in-command Frank Williams (Robert Glenister) points out. He also forces his team to work long hours with little rest. Then the upper echelons of Scotland Yard, probably due to pressure from members of Parliament, decide to release the names and photos of the known perpetrators to the public, much to the objections of Butler and Williams. The releasing of information, as Butler and Williams predicts, leads to disastrous results, further compromising the investigation.

A very enjoyable and well-acted series. Evans makes a good Reynolds, who is not exactly a ruthless criminal but definitely uses rationalization to justify the heist. Broadbent makes a fine Butler, whose aloofness may compromise the success of the investigation. He's tempered by Robert Glenister as Frank Williams who seems the primary voice of reason during the investigation. If you like heist films, this is a real one, and it demonstrates these crimes as not nearly as easy to pull off as you would imagine if you've seen ""Ocean's 11"".",1449446400,,3637,4.996699669966997

However, I felt the robbers segment was done much better and its hard to believe the coppers didn't get most of their information from beating it out of someone. Amazing what one little deviation from the plan can do to you in the final outcome. There were a lot more involved in this crime than the show dealt with and the wrap-up could have been much better by adding more detail into how many were involved and how many got away you have to read up on it afterwards to get a better feeling for it. also, some of the tips could have had a little more detail. Well worth the time and even more so once you put the value of the cash into todays value.",1521676800,,758,4.3076923076923075
8607222,3,B00EO0L6XC,"""The Great Train Robbery"" was broadcast by the BBC in two parts in 2013. To distinguish itself from other film adaptations of Great Britain's 1963 ""Great Train Robbery"" in which 2.6 million was stolen from a Royal Mail Train en route, this version presents events from both the perspective of the criminals and of the police. ""A Robber's Tale"" and ""A Copper's Tale"" are two distinct 90-minute films. In ""A Robber's Tale"", mastermind Bruce Reynolds (Luke Evans) assembles an 8-man team to stop and rob the train, which they then proceed to do. In ""A Copper's Tale"", DCS Tom Butler (Jim Broadbent) is appointed head of the Metropolitan Police Flying Squad and tasked with assembling his own team of investigators to bring the perpetrators of the audacious crime to justice.

In reality, the gang that robbed the train included at least 17 people too many for a movie, so the writers simplified things. ""The Great Train Robbery"" has an impressive cast, but it can't overcome the fact that there isn't enough material for two films. The plans for the heist, constant bickering, and Reynolds' impatience with his puerile gang of thieves is tedious. The filmmakers try hard to make Reynolds interesting but don't succeed until the second film, in which he only appears briefly. They do manage to build suspense around the robbery, but that show doesn't get on the road until halfway through the movie. The ""Coppers"" movie works better, as it pits DSC Butler against Reynolds. But Butler is obsessive, self-righteous and hypocritical, so he's not much fun to watch.

The bottom line is that this should have been one movie, not two. They are bulked out with tedious filler. If the writer wanted to do something different with the story, he might have written a character study of Reynolds and Butler, even if it required a little embellishment. It is intimated in the film that Gordon Goody (Paul Anderson) was convicted partly on falsified evidence. I guess there is no way to know now, but the movie throws the possibility out there without committing to it. This adaptation was inspired by the book ""Signal Red"" by Rob Ryan and makes use of research material from ""The Great Train Robbery: Thee Untold Story from the Closed Investigation Files"" by Andrew Cook. Overall, the movie is a lackluster effort with a strong cast that is wasted on this production.",1512691200,,2352,4.8775
8607223,3,B00EO0L6XC,"This is a good but not great crime drama. It explores an actual train robbery in UK from both robbers' (episode 1) and cops' (episode 1) perspective. Of these, episode one is slightly better. A gang of young robbers gets a tip on a money train which comes into London every night. They plan out where to strike, how to handle different challenges, who will do what and where to establish a base to strike. They do carry out the robbery and grab money byond their wildest expectations. This comes with some complications. The size of the loot and the fact that this was Queen's train makes the establishment go after thee robbers with unprecedented force. Second episode focuses on how the investigation is carried out and the fate of all the robbers.

Though the premise is good (even better considering it is based on actual events), the execution is patchy. I think there should have been at least 4 episodes, to better flesh out the characters and more importantly, show the planning and investigation in depth. Some robbers and cops are not even faces we remember, forget about being fleshed out properly. Even the lead characters are not established strongly. Only the gang leader and the deputy cop lead were strong. The planning part skips many things and it is never established why the robbery would be a seriously challenging undertaking. Robbers are also not very professional and one never gets the feeling that they will get away with it.

However, planning is still better depicted in comparison to the investigation which is treated pretty shoddily. One never gets the idea how leads are obtained and followed through. There is no indications on how some robbers manage to evade capture for long. Threads like unduly harsh sentences, planting of evidence etc are introduced but not explored properly. One gets the feeling that many things were left on the cutting floor. I wanted to read the book this is based on just to get an idea of what really happened.

One benefit of a TV series is that there is sufficient time to go into details and really provide depth. I am not sure what were the constraints when producing this, but the production is seriously hampered by lack of details. They could have done much better since the source material seems pretty interesting.",1505865600,,2286,4.7969543147208125
