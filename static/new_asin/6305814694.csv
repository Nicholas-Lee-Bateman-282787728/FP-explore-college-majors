1078001,2,6305814694,"The original Jaws is one of the finest Horror, and film of any genre ever made. Jaws:The Revenge is not. Mind bogglingly stupid premise, rather poor acting and direction, some may say this is the apitemy of a ""Bad Movie"".  However I must say I found the wild antics of this zany shark  outrageously amusing in places and think that some of the film's score  would have been better replaced with such tunes as Scott Joplin's 'The  Entertainer' or Herb Alphert & the Tijuana Brass performing 'Spanish  Flea'.",946512000,5,506,4.704545454545454
1078002,1,6305814694,"I went to see Jaws 4 out of my respect for the first Jaws and was very disappointed.  The whole idea of the shark wanting the revenge towards the Broady family just didn't do it for me. The effects were not good either.  The shark did not move normally it just seemed to be still framed along.  The ending was sooo bad!  But I won't spoil it for you if you do decide to  watch it.  If you really like the Jaws movies it may just be worth it to  watch once, but never again!",946425600,2,473,3.9157894736842107

I saw Jaws 2 on TV a few weeks back, and I shrugged my shoulders and thought ""Ah, it's a decent sequel."" Then I saw Jaws 3 (aka  Jaws 3-D) and scratched my head. Finally, I got a chance to see Jaws the  Revenge at a friends house...and I still don't understand WHY IN THE NAME  OF ALL THAT'S GOOD would someone have such a cruel heart as to defile the  greatness of Speilberg's masterpiece?! This film is a gross insult to the  first Jaws. I feel sorry for Bruce the shark, and it's not just because he  has been blown apart, electrocuted, blown apart again, and impaled by a  boat!!! It's because he had to star in this WASTE!!!

Jaws 4 eeks past the third stinker if only for the fact that the opening of the film gives  us a handful of the original characters from the first two films, played by  the original actors.

Talon: Being a fan of the Jaws franchise, particularly the first one, I knew this one wasn't going to be as great as the first, but I wasn't expecting the concoction of edited footage to be this terrible. Seriously, it's 90 minutes of disappointment and sadness.

I need a psychologist to help me cope with all the negative emotion JAWS 4 inflicted upon me.

Joe: So let's focus on the good moments.

Talon: There weren't any good moments. And they're weren't any awesome bad moments. It wasn't fun, and it wasn't trying to be fun. They probably spent all twenty three million on Michael Caine and copious amounts of drugs.

Joe: JAWS 2 wasn't very good compared to the first. I liked JAWS 3 because it was in 3D, and had some fun scenes.

JAWS IV: THE REVENGE made me sad in my feels.

Talon: That's it. I'm done being abused by horrible movies. Every time I watch one, sharp pain develops behind my eyes. But now the agony strikes every time I think of JAWS 4.

Oh no, Lorraine Gary's haircut... Oh god. The pain... THE PAIN!

Joe: JAWS 4 came out in 1987. I broke my leg in 1987. JAWS 4 hurt more.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""Is abortion legal when you're nineteen years old?""
""Yes. But I'll still shoot you. We'll call it a mercy killing.""

""I hate this more than HOWARD THE DUCK. And ZAAT.""
""ZAAT was worse. But I hear you.""

""Huh, and Spielberg passed on the chance to direct this.""

""I'm beginning to think that the producers are just trying to cash in on a hit franchise.""

""That haircut... I can't.""

""So... the shark followed them from New York to the Bahamas?""
""Mistakes were made.""

""Worst. Sequel. Ever.""

1078258,1,6305814694,"Didn't  you  guys  like  1, 2, &  3  better?  I  know  I  did.  This  movie  is  probably  the  worst  out  of  all  4  of  them.  Why?  Because  I  don't  think  there  is  enough  action.  The  beginning  is  good,  Sean Brody  dies.  I  think  he's  the  younger  brother  of  Mike  Brody.  He  is  viciously  attacked  when  a  huge  great  white  shark  leaps  out  of  the  water  killing  Sean  who  was  actually  on  the  dock.  In  part  3  I  heard  he  had  settled  somewhere  in  Colorado  to  leave  the  ocean  &  beaches  behind,  to  escape  his  memories  of  the  killer  shark.  Miss  Brody  the  mother  of  Mike  &  his  younger  brother,  is  determined  to  go  after  the  shark  as  the  only  way  to  get  away  from  her  nightmares  &  continue  to  live  a  relaxed  life.  Her  husband  was  gone  then  her  youngest  son.  Now  she  wants  to  prevent  any  more  future  deaths,  so  the  monster  shark  does  not  claim  the  lives  of  anyone  else  in  the  family.  In  my  opinion  the  movie  is  boring.  Not  enough  scares,  lousy  acting.  Not  as  scary  as  the  other  3.  &  kind  of  stupid.",1476489600,,1143,4.1063829787234045

I liked this movie overall.  Many did not and I get it, it's just a feel good movie for me. One thing I do like in a way more about this bluray release , tho not mentioned, they actually Have a 3 minute 42 second alternate theatrical ending and trailer as bonus stuff.  The alternate ending of course is similar to,this amc etc 13th edition endings if this film ehetr the shark does not explode while being stabbed by the boat, but just drags it down under the sea as it dies, stabbed by the bowsprit of the boat.  I thought this was actually a more realistic ending, Tho it cuts Jake played by Mario van peebles out, surfing the shark attack....ugh so which ending is actually the better lol....see it's got me rethinking again....hmm.

made with horror suspense and humor as that movie! This movie could not hold up to that movie but after getting in on VHS while buying
a OLD BIG TUBE TV which I still love over cheap crap LED flat screens I find this movie actually very good! It's well written and has a good
story and directed but mostly it has GOOD ACTORS! unlike the crap the movies they make from Hollyweird today! This movie is smart and
has a suspenseful story behind it and is done very well. So forgot how bad 80's movies were and realize they don't even make that 'bad' which
compared to today are pretty damn good. Jaws The Revenge is actually as good if not better than Jaws 2 which again compared to Jaws?",1467244800,,825,4.19496855345912
1078447,1,6305814694,Horrible. An abomination against humanity.,1467072000,6,42,7.6
1078448,4,6305814694,"This is intended as strictly a review of the blu ray release, and not of the movie itself, as everything negative about this movie has already been covered.
It seems that many blu ray films released of older movies, whomever is responsible for the restoration process, often does it half in / half out.
Watching this movie, much is cleaned up, making many scenes more clear, and the detail pop.  But then there are other scenes that are almost inferior to the dvd release.  That's saying something.  Jaws 3-D for example: horrible transfer. Almost the whole film is grainy and looks worse than dvd.  What source were they using?  For Jaws the Revenge, most of the film looks great.  Then there are darker scenes which showcase more grainy look than the dvd did.  All in all though, a very good transfer.
They did some modifications with this version, which I find strange.  During the shark chase scene with Michael, he enters the sunken ship, we see a glitch in the editing of the original frames. The new frames feature a mirroring of the original scenes. Very interesting.
My biggest gripe about this release is they include the original ending on the extras, and for whatever reason call it the  ""alternate ending"". The shark getting impaled ending is so much more superior than the 50 cent painted jello jiggler shark stuffed with an M-80 on the end of a toothpick inexplicably exploding ending.  Was the impaled shark ending realistic?  Well, no.  But what is realistic about this film?  So, let's just suspend realistic and belief.  The boat was going maybe 10 knots at the most, which would have somewhat injured the shark, and mildly irritated it as it swam away going to get its cousins for some more revenge because it's really, really personal.  Hmph.  Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
The point is they should have kept the original ending in the movie, and made the exploding shark the extra feature, or even made it a choice which ending you wanted to see while viewing the film. So, Universal kind of failed there.....again.
Also, unfortunately, are the lacking of bonus features.  There is a ""making of"" in existence. They should have included that. There are also multiple deleted scenes...definitely should have included those.
So, as far as a definitive version of Jaws the Revenge, we are stuck with this for now. Universal could have ""owned"" this, but they went close to bare bones again.
However, it's nice to have this on blu ray. For those who do enjoy this film, it's worth the $10-$15 upgrade.
FYI: after almost thirty years, Intrada has released the full soundtrack, which is truly the saving grace of the movie. Great score. Comes in second easily after the score of the first film.  Check it out at intrada.com.

1078450,3,6305814694,"This movie could have been so much more if not for the ending. It seems to fall right off the table when Ellen Brody goes shark hunting in her sons science lab sailboat. Maybe fix the shark death scene a bit and bring Hoagie in later on to kill the shark with the plane somehow. And please,...sharks do not make any kind of vocalized sound. Therefore I don't want this one to. Roaring shark, ramming death and ridiculousness aside, this flick isn't as bad as the 2.8 stars it rates on IMDB. Plus I thought it was cool back in the 80's because it was the first Jaws movie that I was old enough to see in the theaters. Quality Blu-ray transfer also.",1466467200,,647,4.2682926829268295

1078489,4,6305814694,"Who ever thought we'd see the day when Jaws......The Revenge would hit blu ray. Back when JAWS hit blu ray in 2012 I believe, we were promised that the sequels were on their way as well. Now almost 4 years later, that promise has been completed as 2-4 are now available from Universal. First off, let's be honest that this movie is far from good. The story is absolutely bat$!&#, the action is very badly edited, and above all the movie is honestly quite boring but I digress. There's beautiful scenery all through the film, the actors tried their best with what they were in, and there's still some great moments to be found with the shark. And to be more honest, only true fans of the entire of series will OWN this blu ray. So let's talk about the actual release itself on blu. This film was given a transfer treatment by someone who cared. The colors pop, there's very little if any grain through the film, and overall the textures are very smooth being a treat for the eyes. Picture and sound an easy 4/5 for me on this disc, but special features get a 2/5 only being the SD Theatrical Trailer and the infamous Alternate Ending, which is a fun watch, however I would've really liked to see the Complete Jake's Death sequence but hey, we got the Jaws......The Revenge on blu ray so beggars can't be choosers.

1078490,1,6305814694,"I originally didn't mind this entry into the franchise the first time .

I also liked the actress who played the main character she was very like able I still find her a good actress and very like able .

However that being said this entry was an abomination to the franchise it never should have seen the light of day period.

The effects are awful and as many have said its obvious to anyone who has seen Jaws that there was a lot of footage from Jaws that they tried to pass off as Revenges.

I understood this entry was about a mother grieving over losing her son to the formidable shark and I also understood her anger towards the shark that took her sons life .

But other then that the acting was sub par at best as was the overall plot of the film .

It didn't make sense and the random attacks in the film were horribly done .

At the time I felt bad for the mom that was killed but now I look back on it thinking man what a stupid woman lol

Michael Caines character was pointless as was the Jamaican guy played by Mario Van Peebles .

The ending was laughable and more like something you would see out of a comedy .

The close calls of a few of the characters were also completely illogical and ridiculous and not the least bit realistic .

These characters reminded me of LL Cool J in Halloween H20 after being shot dozens of times claiming the bullet just GRAZED HIM LMAO

Horrible movie and a pointless entry into the franchise .

1078585,1,6305814694,"This movie is considered one of the worst movies ever made, and for good reasons. A stupid plot, atrocious acting, and laughable special effects. This shark somehow holds a grudge against the protagonist of the first 2 Jaws movie, Martin Brody, apparently because he ""killed its friends."" Lol. Also, how does a shark travel from New York to the Bahamas in 3 days? (Also it was following a boat the entire time) Better question: Why would it feel hate against a human being? Better question: Does Ellen have some kind of psychic link to the shark? Because whenever the shark attacks someone Ellen knows, she gets a feeling of dread, which is kooky-talk. Why does the shark roar? Sharks don't have lungs or vocal cords. Why is the tagline for the movie ""This time, it's personal"" when in Jaws 2 a character (I forgot her name) told Roy ""Sharks don't take things personally."" ??? And why is it set at winter time?! And the way Martin Brody died. Oh my Jesus. Roy Scheider was smart enough to say no to the last 2 Jaws movie, so they killed him off in the most ridiculous way possible. Apparently he died of a heart attack because of the fear of the shark. I don't know about you, but when I kill 2 sharks as awesomely as Martin did in the first 2 Jaws movie, I wouldn't be very scared of sharks either. The editing is also choppy. Just a bunch of cut out footage and a bit of squirming from the actors and a little fake blood and that's literally every death in the movie. They even sped up footage of Ellen's hands reaching for the fridge! Why was that necessary?! And don't get me started on the special effects. The green screen is just terrible. I can do a lot better with a freaking iPad. And the shark is out of the water most of the time. In the last confrontation with the shark, you can actually see the mechanism propelling the shark forwards. (Also, in the scene, Michael Caine was attacked by the shark, somehow survives, and goes in the water and emerges, with a wet shirt. In the next shot, his shirt is completely dry. Magic?) And how does impaling the shark make it blow up?

Whatever. I bet Roy Schieder is rolling in his grave right now, and he died years after this godawful atrocity came out. Only buy it if you're looking for some laughs or if you're a critic who wants to rip this movie apart.",1451779200,2,2312,4.376744186046512

which is proved by jaws: the revenge, the fourth ""best"" of the jaws flicks. this time, with good reason, the shark is after the brody family; who can blame these large squali? the brody's have done nothing but harass and harm these gentle fish. the real movie here would have featured no shark; the revenge, instead of clumsily being ascribed to a fish with no familial impulses, would simply be the result of the shark's actions. if ellen brody was a terrified wreck the rest of her life, well, that would have been sufficient. instead, it is suggested that, among other things, the shark placed a dock piling at buoy in order to draw sean brody out into water. hmmm, why not? i also disliked the lack of continuity between jaws 3 and jaws 4. i'm also a little annoyed at sean's fate. he went through a lot, especially in the second movie; to do him like alien 3 did newt is...not in the spirit of the franchise, if you ask me. i will give credit to this movie for giving us some decent roy scheider flashbacks, and allowing ellen an opportunity to embrace her grief. additionally, jaws: the revenge has to be the only action movie ever made where the hero is mostly called ""gramma"" and wears enormous, squared-off shoulder pads in every garment. terrible special effects, beautiful carribean scenery, and some nookie betwixt lorraine gary and michael caine round out this fascinating disaster.",1438128000,,1524,4.707865168539326

GW follows her and fam to the warm waters of Bermuda....or the Bahamas....or someplace tropical to kill them and so restore it's honor. Or something.

Except that all prior movies have shown the demise of the attacking shark at the end.

And I'm sad to say, but yes the Shark is blown up in the end. I was hoping against hope that it would be stabbed and sinks, even though the sticker on it says new footage not seen in U.S. theaters. This is because the explosion ending was the release in Europe. Test audiences didn't like the stabbing ending so they changed it and had Jake live, which bothers everybody.

1078805,1,6305814694,"I saw this when it came out in the theatres back in 1987, it was horrible then and the film has not gotten any better with age.  The plot is stupid a shark attacking one particular family seems ridiculous.  The opening scene looks like the Shark kills Sean in the middle of a calm lake in Minnesota, anywhere but off the Northeast coastline.

But look on the bright side at least it inspired an ending for the Little Mermaid movie from Disney 2 years later in 1989.  The scene where Eric rams the galley into Ursula is totally ripped off from yours truly Jaws the Revenge.  The Little Mermaid did great at the box office.

The film might have worked if it followed a new cast of people other than the Brody's.  A large great white shark attacking swimmers in the warm waters in the Bahamas makes sense. I keep thinking of the movie ""The Deep"" another Robert Shaw classic film about sunken treasure that was a smart fun adventure movie. Maybe the directors of Jaws the Revenge could have gone with some kind of storyline such as that.  Where divers are trying to find something specific off a sunken ship that happens to be on a reef that is home to a great white shark.  At least something like that would make sense.  This movie is so bad I thought for sure that the shark was going to jump out of the water and take down Michael Caine's little plane in mid flight.  Hey if the shark can eat a helicopter in Jaws 2 why not a plane in Jaws 4.

Everything has been pretty much said and written about this film I do not have to much to add.  For all its campiness I did not think Jaws 3 was near as bad as this film.  Oh be sure I hated Jaws 2 as well.  I still do not know what to think for people that give that movie positive reviews. But Jaws 4 takes the cake as one of the worst movies ever made.

Despite the poor editing at crucial dramatic moments that disappointed me initially, the cast, the scripting and the location cinematography make up for quite a bit. The film has a nostalgic feel to it. This element is what draws you in. The opening was shot in Martha's Vineyard and latter the story shifts to the Bahamas where there is actually some great cinematography. Other shots were filmed on Universal's back lot, but the overall effect of the locations is a strong point. The cast that includes Lorraine Gary, Michael Caine, Mario Van Peebles, Lance Guest and Karen Young. I thought the photography was excellent and the story not all that bad.

This time, another Brody is killed off by a great white shark and Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) is convinced its picking her family off one by one. She moves to the Bahamas with her other son, a marine biologist, and falls in love with a local pilot (Michael Caine). It's not long before a great white shark arrives off the coast and Ellen is further convinced it's the EXACT SAME SHARK. Idiotic premise from start to finish with a shark so fake, you'd think they were shooting a toy in the bathtub. Caine tries his best but you can only do so much with garbage. (Interesting side note: Caine only accepted the role because he always wanted to shoot a film in Hawaii, where this film was primarily filmed.)",1407542400,,789,4.602836879432624

1079077,2,6305814694,"So, Jaws: The Revenge. Ellen Brody is the protagonist of this one. She's recently widowed and then loses her son Sean in the opening sequence, which is actually pretty good. It's set in Amity at night and has a reasonable amount of suspense and a fine sense of irony. Then after the funeral Ellen decides to go to the Bahamas to visit her other son Michael and things take a turn for the ridiculous. The shark that killed Sean follows Ellen to the Bahamas, where Ellen develops a psychic connection that warns her when it's about to attack. And when it attacks, the movie goes into silly overdrive, because the animatronic shark is so hilarious that you could compare it to the carpet monster in The Creeping Terror. Whenever I saw that thing pitch and jaw through the water with a demented fixed grin on its face I was laughing too hard to be concerned for the character supposedly in mortal danger. If you're paying attention you'll notice the actors kind of have to situate themselves into the shark's mouth. Somebody could have done a better editing job on this. And then there's that scene where it's chasing Michael through an underwater shipwreck. It sort of scoots along on the ship's floor. I laughed until tears ran down my face. I won't go into its mysterious ability to hold itself above water by its tail with no visible means of support, because I'm sure other reviewers have brought that up. If you like 'so bad they're great' movies, Jaws: The Revenge is one you have to see. It's almost as funny as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon (nothing's as funny as The Line though).",1407283200,2,1582,4.593639575971731

Whatever money that was supposed to be used for production budget obviously just went to con Michael Caine into being in the film. Which in a way is maybe not so bad because when he shows up it's a brief breath of fresh air and a glimmer of light before being shoved back in the metaphoric coffin and the nails get hammered in again...The effects are horrific, and not in a good ""horror movie"" way. The blood, the shark, the wounds. Just awful. The acting is terrible, but you can't put too much blame on actors if there is a non-existent script or any remote direction. The story? Well if you believe that a Great White shark will travel to places it's not even remotely indigenous to for the sake of seeking revenge on the wife of the guy that killed it's relative back in the 1970's, then you have a masterpiece...

There are other things in the storyline that are too much to accept.  Like Michael Caine crashing his expensive plane into the ocean so he can put himself and Mama Brody into danger on a sinking boat with everyone else instead of radioing for help.  An airplane in the sky is not going to intimidate a shark under the water.  I only gave this a two star instead of one because Michael Caine is in it.",1402272000,3,653,4.118110236220472

After watching them I remembered why I didn't own the DVD's - they are horrible movies.  Jaws 3, based in sea world, is void of tension and suspense that Jaws inspires and I found myself not caring who got eaten and who lived.  The effects are absolutely horrible and its difficult to believe Jaws 3 came after the first Jaws as far as effects go.  The Revenge is even worse, right down to the ending where the worst shark special effects in a movie occur.

1079208,1,6305814694,"This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The movie didn't make a lot of sense and I am not sure why it was made. I felt sorry for Michael Caine for being in it. I am glad he was paid heavily and atleast the film was good for someone as it was never good for the viewers. It's a waste of time. Sadly you stare at the screen wondering how a character who has been chewing on by the shark for five minutes all of the sudden is alive at the end. The film wasn't scary it was sad. This is the type of film they show to young filmmakers to show them how not to make a film. They usually start with the positives. The first step was hiring a good actor. In this case Michael Caine. But they forgot to follow the rest of the steps in making a good film like writing a script that makes sense and write characters the audience will care about if they are in danger of being eaten by a giant shark.

The acting was awful. Lorraine Gary is a capable actress but she can't overcome the poorly written script. Caine can't do enough to make the film worth watching. Lance Guest normally does alright in his movies but here he was especially bad. Do yourself a favor and instead of watching this go rent Jaws and rewatch Robert Shaw's famous speech on the boat in the first Jaws it will help you to remember the brilliance of the first movie and how the way the film should be remembered.

1079228,1,6305814694,"The subtitle of this movie is The Revenge. The only revenge I see taking place is on us as the viewers. There's not much to say on this movie except that it's a disgrace to all Jaws stands for. (Or is that swims for?)

 For one thing the plot is ludicrous. The idea that a shark is after the Brody family to right all the wrongs they have done against its own kind is too far fetched to work. Sure, it was hinted at in the second part and also the third (which this movie pretends never took place) but up in our face like this is too funny. Lorraine Gary as the returning mother even goes as far as to say that the shark caused her husbands death (he died of a heart attack, which she claims the stress from the sharks caused). While that may or may not be true, the way she says it is comical. She was never the main star before but she is here. Who knew she would survive so long in the series? In the book Jaws The Revenge it's explained that there was a voodoo curse put on the Brody family over what they feared most (the Great White Shark). I don't know if they thought it was too cheesy to include here but it would have at least attempted a half assed explanation.

 The movie opens well, believe it or not. We jump from the POV of little kids singing Christmas Carols to a gruesome, vicious all-out attack on the youngest Brody Brother Sean. The shark dives into the boat, rips off an arm, you name it. Blood all over the place, effective screaming, a horrible way to die. There is another incredible death on some sort of weird boat-float thing where a bunch of swimmers are sitting on it and the shark, in open view, grabs one of the girls. It's a graphic scene (although not as graphic as Quints demise in part one or the first death in this stinker) but the excitement ends here as this sequel goes into committing the same maladies as the third one: boredom.

 Simply put, I grew drowsy.  Especially when Hoagie (Michael Caine) is introduced -- the man isn't my favorite actor to begin with but him and Ellen courting and the whole Bahamas vacation caused more than five yawns, and that's way too many to be induced by a movie of any kind. Besides the two above deaths, all other killings or attempted ones are stupid, unrealistic, and distasteful.

 The acting and general setup of the characters made me wish the supernaturally smart shark would kill them all. The surviving characters...couldn't have happened. Can you say unrealistic?

 I can't help but wonder why the family just won't leave the islands (or else stop working in the water!) You would think they would have developed some giant phobia of it. Will they ever learn? Do we even care if they end up as merely human mince meat?

 As for the shark itself...it's large and it's rubbery but not as bad (by far) as part three. But while the second shark in part 2 may have growled, this one actually roars -- I kid you not! A giant battle cry roar when going after Ellen Brody. So now every surviving shark is going to try and take a piece out of this family that doesn't have enough sense to stay out of the ocean?

 One part that was hysterical (but wasn't meant to be) was when Jaws the IV leapt up and grabbed the Jamaican guy off the boat rail. The cameras enhanced everything by causing all to go quiet and flashing in slow motion from everyone's reactions. Didn't work by far and definitely didn't result in any fright. There's no fear here but the heart does do a nice beat at the beginning; such a shame as it all started so well and flopped over so fast! During the ending showdown they *attempt* suspense with a good score and overacting but it just instills more hatred of this now gutted and left-out-to-rot series.

 This one was obviously slapped together very quickly in order to cash in on the cash shark. If this movie actually took TIME to work out, God help us all.",1379635200,,3862,4.341666666666667

Yes, it's bad on so many levels, seriously, I can't argue with that.  Even more bizarre, it could actually be considered a Christmas movie as so much of it takes place during the holidays.  You can hear Noel sung as the poor Brody boy (Mitchell Anderson) dies in agony, arm chewed off, screaming for all he's worth.  Even the log he was sent out to move could serve as proxy for a Yule log.  Hello, nothing says Merry Christmas like becoming the feast of the day!
As for the story this time out; Chief Brody's dead, Sean's dead, and now mother Brody has turned into a loon.  Moreover, the woman has developed a strange psychic connection to this vengeful shark that's willing to go on vacation to the Bahamas just to chew up the rest of the family.  This was a well thought out plot, can't you tell?  They used a boat for pity sake to finally bring it down.  It spontaneously blows up upon contact (we all know just how volatile sharks can be).  That alone proves the miracle of Christmas!  It's all tied in, trust me.

I would have loved to have been in the board room when they pitched this idea.

It was nominated in several categories for a Golden Raspberry Award: worst actress (Lorraine Gary), worst actor (Bruce the shark), worst supporting actor (Michael Caine), worst screenplay (Michael de Guzman), worst picture, worst director (Joseph Sargent), and it won worst visual effects (Henry Millar).

I'd love to say that was the case, but it also became more and more clear as the movie went on that all this was meant to be taken seriously. Somebody has a confrontation with a shark, after which the shark travels thousands of kilometres to track that person down. Somebody spots a shark while flying overhead in a light aircraft and has the bright idea of crashing the plane kamikaze-style into the shark in an attempt to kill it. Of course it fails dismally and they all have near-death experiences, but to be honest I can't say how they killed the shark in the end, as by this point the whole film just seemed to have been a waste of time and my concentration was drifting. I cannot fathom how Michael Caine got involved in the project, he surely must have been severely broke to have even considered it. Watch it for a laugh, this is a film people in 50 years will be watching as a comedy, or as a cult bad movie like Night Of The Living Dead.",1355097600,,1264,4.292887029288703

1079312,1,6305814694,"Jaws: The Revenge - because apparently great white sharks can nurse a mean grudge. This is one of those movies people love to hate, and with good reason. Our story finds the late Martin Brody's family the target of another monsterous shark that's come to  the waters of Amity Island. Don't roll your eyes just yet, there's more!

Ellen Brody becomes convinced the great whites of the world are out to get her and her family. She blames them for her husband's fatal heart attack. Her paranoia is solidified when her youngest son loses limb and life (yes, in that order) to the aforemetioned monster fish. Instead of doing the smart thing like moving to Nebraska, Ellen wisely decides to visit her living son in the Caribbean. After all, what safer place is there from a huge fish with a axe to grind?

It can only be assumed the bulk of this movie's budget went towards a vast supply of illegal substances. How else can you explain the ridiculous story of a great white ""hunting"" the Brody family? How else can you explain a talented cast of actors signing on for this dreck, let alone finishing it? How else can you explain the use of the King Kong roar for the shark when it strategically impales itself on a boat? Yes, they used the same roar from the 1976 version of King Kong for the shark!

1079314,3,6305814694,"As a future marine biologist, the original JAWS was what first planted the seed of my shark fascination. I love all sea predators, and sharks are definitely one of the best. And as such, whenever I found a JAWS film that my eyes had yet to view, I had to get it. Love the original classic, the next one JAWS 2, liked it, mainly cause of the music, however I learned about how Roy Scheider didn't want any part of this one. Then I saw JAWS 3-D or simply JAWS 3 as it is no longer in 3-D. This one gets bashed quite a bit, but honestly this third film scared me the most, mainly cause alot of the scenes involving the giant shark were very dark, making it eerie. Then finally I stumbled upon this one: Jaws The Revenge. Now at that time, I knew nothing about film or what makes a good film. As I got older, I had seen countless reviews on how this was one of the absolute worst films ever, so bad that saying anything postitive about it would've been a Cardinal sin.

HOWEVER...Im going to be honest here: I don't find it all that bad. Yes! You heard me! Im not all that disappointed with it. Maybe its cause Im not really someone who tries to be a critic, but as I said, I really don't think this film is as horrible as so many others say it is...and Im going to point out that some of the main complaints this film gets, to me, are exaggerated and overrated. So, what I will do is list the main complaints about this film, explain why these parts aren't so bad once one stops and thinks for a moment, and even point out a contradiction that many don't seem to notice, so here we go:

Now I know alot of you critics are thinking DUDE! How can you defend such garbage?!? Just hear me out and read on:

-Complaint #1: Ellen Brody's flashbacks to scenes of the first JAWS film.

I read alot of reviews where people seem to get all waah! waah! waah! about Ellen Brody's flashbacks of different moments from the original film. But just think about this for a second. The first flashback she has was a scene in JAWS that she actually witnessed, which is Martin playing gestures with the younger son Sean, who is the first shark victim in Revenge btw. It would make perfect sense to have that flashback cause she was there! Secondly there is the flashback she is having from the first film which features the epic ending where Martin is trying to shoot the air tank in the sharks mouth. Now I understand that it would make zero sense for her to flashback that scene, but did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the reason she was picturing that particular scene was..I don't know...maybe because Martin may have actually told her about it between the first and second films? As far as Im concerned, he told her what had happened in the time frame b/w Jaws and Jaws 2. It may not have been part of the films, but I don't care.

-Complaint #2: The Shark Following the Family to the Bahamas

Sure, it is unrealistic for an animal such as a shark to kill out of vengeance, completely unnatural. However it isn't so unnatural for a great white to make a long distance migration. Great whites are known for swimming great distances from the US Pacific coast to Hawaii. No one really knows yet why they take these long journeys, but it does happen. Plus it is mentioned in this film that great whites don't like warm water, however, great whites are actually warm blooded and can adapt their body temperatures to cold and warm water, which is why great whites can be found in coastal waters worldwide with the exception of arctic and antarctic waters. Now that still doesnt explain the whole ""revenge"" thing. Well, all I can say is, the whole revenge plot was something the director put in just to make it scarier. Feel free to whine about that all u want, but as far as the shark swimming from New England to the Bahamas, it is actual great white behavior, it just takes place in the Pacific, not the Atlantic.

-Complaint #3: Michael Cain & Mario Van Peebles

Now Ive heard mixed opinions when it comes to Cain. I honestly thought Cain was annoying and unnecessary, basically because the makers of this movie tried to put in a sub-plot where he has a thing for Mrs Brody. Im not a big fan of subplots. But he did offer some quick comedy relief when the shark tries to eat him and he utters what many consider the best line of the whole film, but youll have to watch it to see, or just see if u can pulll it up on YouTube.

Now as for Peebles, yes, his Caribbean-Jamaican accent can get old, but honestly he made me laugh. Im serious, the first time I saw this, he had me rollin, especially the scene where he tries to put some electric device into the shark's mouth only to fall into its jaws. The look on his face and the music playing at that moment match perfectly and I was hysterical. Its still the only scene in a scary movie that makes my ribs hurt from laughing.

-Complaint #4: The ""Explosive"" Ending

Alot of people whine and mope about the ending which bears strong resemblance to the first film, yet also makes no sense. The ending Im talking about is of course where Ellen stabs the shark in the gills with the broken end of the boat...and the shark just blows up and we see the footage from the first film of the shark sinking to the sea bottom. There are actually two different endings to Jaws The Revenge. The one everyone is used to, sadly, is on the dvd. However, the original theatrical release shows an ending very different: the shark still gets stabbed, but instead of blowing up, blood gushes out of its mouth, the weight of the shark causes the boat to snap in half, and we see the bow of the boat sinking to the bottom with the shark impaled on it. Now that ending is a much better ending and shouldve been put on the dvd as far as I go. Why they chose to make an explosive ending, i don't know. But the original ending I would take any day.

-Complaint #5: The Roaring Shark

And now we come to what everyone claims is the biggest outrage of the film: a roaring shark. Yes, a shark cannot roar, even I will admit that...but did it ever occur to anyone that the sharks from the other 3 films ALSO MADE UNNATURAL SOUNDS?...

(Remember what I said about a certain contradiction?)

Thats Right! The shark in Revenge isn't the only one guilty of this. How do I know? Simple:

-JAWS: When the shark bursts through the glass as the Orca is sinking, trying to finish off Brody, you can clearly hear a gurgle-growling sound erupting from its throat. Sharks cant roar, but they cant growl either.

-JAWS 2: There is a scene where two sailboaters are trying to pull one of their fallen bretheren out of the water and the shark is closing in. They barely get the guy into the boat as the shark's jaws pass by, barely missing the victim's legs. It is during this moment that you can hear a roaring type sound coming from this shark that sounds quite similar to one of the T-rex sounds from Jurassic Park. Dont believe me, watch and listen...

-JAWS 3-D: This shark makes far more unnatural growls in one scene alone than all the other sharks from the other films combined! Pretty much every time you see this shark, it opens its mouth and wouldnt ya know? A growl erupts!

Now, as Ive said, Jaws The Revenge may be one of the worst films in history according to all the big critics out there, but the next time someone complains about a roaring shark or Ellen Brody's flashbacks...just think about what I said...

The plot makes NO sense whatsoever and the Shark is the fakest thing I have ever seen...BUT there is more to it then meets the eye! Jaws: The Revenge originally had a lot more scenes and sub-plots which ended up being cut out of the film. Such as, when the shark is stabbed by the boat, it roars and blood is pouring out of it's mouth until is finally starts to sink and the heartbeat of the shark fades away. However, on the DVD version, the shark blows up for no reason! Also, in the original version, Jakes dies, but in the DVD version, Jakes happens to live somehow..don't ask how, I'm not a doctor. As you can see, the original version of the film is much better than what Universal gave us on the DVD. All these scenes I have talked about were seen in the US Theatrical Version of Jaws the Revenge released in 1987, however, Universal decided to use the European Theatrical Version for the DVD/VHS/Laserdisc release of the film. The US version has aired on TV in America and Europe. AMC, back in 2004, aired the uncut version of Jaws the Revenge but it had many errors such as scenes being re-arranged. In the UK, BBC-1 aired Jaws the Revenge with the completed uncut ending and the alternate death scene that Jake had. But it did not include other uncut scenes such as Jake and Mike playing guitar on the porch, Ellen talking to Michael about her adverture in Eygpt, Mike showing Neptunes Folly to Ellen, Hoagie talking to Ellen in front of large cruise ships, the extended intro, and a scene where Hoagie and Mike are having an argument. There are a few more uncut scenes but they have not yet surfaced on TV versions, they only exist on the US 35mm print of Jaws the Revenge. As you can see, the ORIGINAL version of Jaws the Revenge was much better than what we got on the Home Video release of it. Why do you think it says ""CONTAINS NEW FOOTAGE NOT SEEN IN US THEATERS"" on the VHS..? It is referring to the added scenes of Jake living,etc. If you ever contact Universal, PLEASE tell them that we need a proper release of Jaws the Revenge.

1079341,1,6305814694,"Everybody is entitled to his or her opinion, but those people who would give this piece of shark turd of a movie a four star rating, I would love to see what other kind of movies you watch.

Jaws: The Revenge is simply one of the worst movies that have ever graced the silver screen. I am sure that many straight to video films were better shot and plotted. There are so many stupid and inane things about this film that the fact that the shark roared (the shark also roared in the first and second movie) and it looked fake is the least of its problems.

The problem is, the storyline is so thin and pointless and in the process of stretching this wreck to movie length, that the entire movie is filled with scenes that added nothing to the plot or characterss.

The plot is, as you probably know already, Sean, the younger son of Ellen and the now deceased Martin Brody got killed (that means Marge from Jaws 2 shouldn've let him get eaten anyway) and Ellen is convinced that a shark did it and is exacting revenge on the Brody family.

Michael, the older son, persuades Ellen to join him and his wife and daughter in the Bahamas so she can get her mind off Sean's death. The Bahamas is surronded by water, but water too warm for great whites. But in this case, that didn't deter the revenge seeking shark from swimming all the way from New Enlgand to the Caribbean in pursuit of the Brodys.

Meanwhile, Ellen meets Hoagie, played by Michael Caine, who apparently used his salary to purchase a home in the Bahamas and have yet to even saw this film. The two began courting while a jealous Michael glowers from the sidelines.

The shark, once it arrives in the Bahamas, chases after Michael and his faux-Jamaican assistant played by Mario Van Peebles in one failed attempt after another to eat them. When the shark finally targeted Michael's daughter Thea, Ellen commandeered a boat and ram it into the shark and in Lorraine Gary's own words, in a way you wouldn't believe.

How right she was.

So that is the story in a nutshell and all could probably be squeezed into a one-hour TV episode; but that won't do for a theatrical release, so they padded it with endless scenes of Ellen and Hoagie romancing one another, or Michael and his wife arguing about who haven't been taking out the garbage. And the shark attacks were so few and far in between that I wonder if Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine were actually making another movie entirely and somewhere half-way through they decided to make it into a Jaws sequel and shoehorned the shark into the proceedings.

And most maddeningly of all, in an act of utter desecration and desperation, they spliced in scenes from the first movie, supposedly to represent Ellen remembering events from the past (and most of which she was not witness to, ironically, but not surprsing given how stupid this film is).

As for people who defends this movie, a great white shark lurking in the waters of New England in the first movie is probably as improbable as a great white taking personal vengeance on the Brodys, but at least the first movie was so well made that it makes you suspend your disbelief and overlook some of its flaws (like the exploding scuba tank and the roaring shark).

In the end, this movie disgraced the legacy of the very first movie. The fact there are Jaws ripoffs out there that are actually better than this movie is a sad commentary.",1309564800,,3401,4.522801302931596
1079342,3,6305814694,"Jaws The Revenge(1987) was a critical and commercial failure. It's considered one of the worst movies ever made. It's considered to be ""the worst Jaws movie"". It ignores the events of Jaws 3-D(1983)! When I grew up, TV stations always showed it to pad out their programming. Jaws The Revenge is nowhere as bad as some of the Z-grade movies from the 1950's and 1960's. Joseph Sargent's directing is fine, but the film is hurt by a weak script about a shark trying to kill off the Brody Family!

The only interesting and redeeming feature of this film is the gimmick of putting a camera on the shark's POV (or rather, his dorsal fin's POV).  In an odd way, it works.

An early scene in the film shows one of Brody's sons being attacked and eaten by the shark during the Christmas season.  It reminded me of a ""Jaws"" novelty song that was released just before Christmas in 1975.  It was a parody of ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" -- I remember a line that went, ""And what to my wondering eyes should appear/but Santa Jaws, who ate tiny reindeer"".  Poetry.

I'm not joking about that.  That's how they explain Roy Scheider's absence.  He had a heart attack because he was scarred of sharks.  Really.

Really this is a story of a feud between two families as a member of the Jaws family is upset that the Brody's keep killing his or her relatives and plots revenge against the family.  First he or she kills Sheriff Brody's youngest son who is no longer a theme-park-building-cowboy but a New England cop like his dad, then swims super-fast to get to the Bahamas around the same time Mrs. Brody and her family get there.  Keep in mind that Brody's don't swim from New England to the Bahamas but instead take a plane.  That is one fast shark.  Maybe I'm being too sarcastic.  Perhaps it's a different shark than the one in Amity Island.  Maybe the one in the Bahamas is a member of a Miami shark cartel and was paid by the shark in New England.

Oh, and why did Mrs. Brody leave her home in Maine?  Because it was on a body of land surrounded by water; in other words, an island, and she was getting kind of freaked out by sharks.  So she wisely moves to South Dakota where there are no sharks.  No, just kidding, she moves to The Bahamas, which isn't just one island, it's like seven-hundred islands.  See, much better.

The shark in this film looks a little long in the tooth.  Some of the shots of it feature a broken dorsal fin that's barely connected; it just kind of flops back and forth.  Maybe it's the same model from the previous films.  If so, maybe this belies some deeper subplot to the franchise.  Perhaps the previous sharks didn't explode but have been somehow secretly replacing the fine Brody family members they normally serve here with different people.  Maybe that's what was really bothering Sheriff Brody. Later in the film the dorsal fin got better.

Anyway, the dialog is a little better than the third film, which was really bad, but the lack of plot required the director to have lots of scenes that go on and on and on but that don't add anything to the story.  It's sort of like the movie is made out of nothing more than deleted scenes.  Also, just as a side point, most of the film takes place in the Bahamas, in the sun, yet nobody wears sunglasses.  Nobody.  Well, there was this one guy, but he wore the flip up kind and always had them in flip up mode.  I found this harder to swallow than many of the other inconsistencies that are a constant feature of this movie.  And why do great white sharks blow up when you shoot them.  And knowing that all you have to do is shoot them, why not shoot them earlier in the film?

On a positive note, it's one of the best looking Jaws films in that the print looks mostly good and is bright and colorful; everything looks as if it was filmed last year.  Also, Michael Cain is in it.  That's good.",1295827200,2,3555,4.372519083969466

1079369,2,6305814694,"Considered by most to be the worst film in the series, JAWS: THE REVENGE has earned a notorious reputation for its laughable plot and poor designs, but logical inconsistencies aside, there is still plenty of killer shark action to be enjoyed here. After Shawn Brody is killed by yet another Great White shark, his mother becomes obsessed with the idea that the sharks are out to destroy her family. She demands that Mike, their eldest son, quits his research in the Caribbean to ensure his safety, but when Mike and his research partner discover a Great White prowling the warm waters of the Bahamas, they set off to study the man-eater. How or why a Great White could have made it down to the Bahamas is besides the point. What is important in this third sequel is that the shark is there, and it is royally pissed. This is easily the cruelest and most violent of any of the JAWS films, where the shark literally has to go out of its way to attack everything and anything in its way (planes not excluded). After the Brody family killed four of the shark's closest relatives, it has finally come back to even the score! It is also the darkest film in the series, lacking the lighter humor that broke up the terror and suspense of the earlier films. Lance Guest offers the most memorable take on Mike Brody, bringing a seriousness and intensity to the role despite the silliness of the plot. There is one element present in THE REVENGE that manages to successfully recreate the same heart-racing anxiety of John Williams' original theme, and that is the shark's heart-rate monitor that thumps aggressively as the shark draws nearer. What can't be denied or overlooked is the dreadful design of the shark, itself, which is as unconvincing as it is unintentionally funny. Michael Caine said it best when asked about the film after its release: ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific."" JAWS: THE REVENGE may be as stupid and utterly ridiculous as it has been made out to be, but it is still oddly entertaining as a supremely guilty pleasure.

Where it's not the best of the pack, but certainly not the worst I must say I especially like this one. It was different and edgy and had me on the edge of my seat. With Sheriff Brody not in it, it did have it's downfall but still the 'Revenge' part is great with a mother and widow who's been pushed to the brink after Four movies and has had enough. I can't say I'd react much different than she did haha!

2. this movie is boring there is only three shark attacks
3. this movie is pretty much like a soap opera [if you want to know why then watch it]
4. the shark somehow knows that Ellen Brody is moving to the Bahamas with her older son Micheal and it gets there faster than ellen does
5. the shark chomps into some guy's stomach near the end and if you pause the movie at that part you can see the shark hovering above the water
6. the shark jumps out of the water and ..........ROARS! thats right he roars just like a lion
7. ellen rams the shark with the boat and guess what? the shark just blows up for no reason

Few minutes later it jumps up again and they actually stab it with the boat. then you find out the Jamaican is still alive, they swim back to shore, and they're all ha-ha happy and the movie ends.

1079374,1,6305814694,"I hadn't witnessed this fiasco since I was a little kid, and I still remember thinking back then how pathetic this movie was. I once had claimed that Batman and Robin was the worst movie in history, but after watching this again, I can tell you it's even.

Many things I noticed this time, things that I was too young to do when I first watched this garbage. Bear with me:

First:""Jaws the Revenge"" (And this time personal) is the story of a shark that is LITERALLY out for revenge! It first attacked the youngest of the Brody's and now is after the other sibling, even the sibling's daughter at one point of the flick. Indeed, this shark is so smart that he can track the bloodline of Chief Brody (rest in peace) in order to attack his remains;  smartest shark in history? Very much so.  It is also incredibly smart that it was able to follow the Brody family from their hometown Amity to all the way to... ready? The Bahamas! Yup, it overheard the conversation hundreds of miles from shore or simply knew by how the water tasted at distant that the folks had temporarily relocated.

Another flaw of the deprived film is how the shark would literally lift himself up (15 to 20 feet approximately), and take a bite of the side of the boat for either intimidation purposes or to catch its prey, as it happened with the first victim. Since when can sharks elevate at such height and literally out of nowhere decide to munch on the side of a vessel? I don't care if it's just a `movie' but it's not a cartoon either.

Did I mention that this shark can roar? Yes, that too! This shark not only has the brains but also `thee' vocal chords. His roaring makes a grown lion look like a cub. To top things off it also has a big grin throughout the whole movie. You may think it is smiling and smirking but the truth is it was so poorly designed that its creators forgot to make it look like an actual shark (And stop showing off its teeth on every appearance).

The black dude in the end, after getting chewed by the fantastic beast incredibly managed to survive. Don't ask me how but I guess since it's a movie he knew how to pull that one off.

In the long run, I recommend everyone to watch this film; not because it's good, on the contrary, to realize how bad and absurd it is. Sometimes you have to see it to believe it. The eighties are popular for producing tacky and cheesy films, but this one takes the cake.

I read an interview of Michael Caine not so long ago, where he admitted in never watching this movie (mind you, he was part of the supporting cast). Is he to blame for his decision?",1279497600,5,2591,4.303901437371663

Also Is this Jaws A Family member of the first? who gave him the memo to avenge his Finned Friend or family? and why the roar like the one in previous jaws?(Jaws 3/3d).the movie is more drama than shark, with the shark making zany appearances throughout,What was Michael Caine and Van Peebles thinking?

One of the stupidest films I've ever seen with some really ridiculous moments. This is actually a good thing because this film is so bad that the only possible reason to watch this is it's extreme stupidity! One of my favorite moments is when the shark jumps on the side of a boat and roars!...the sound used for the shark's roar was used on 'The Munsters' TV show for Spot's roar! lol!

1079377,5,6305814694,"This movie would have been wonderful if it had been more subtle. The plot is actually wonderful, implausible, yet you believe the story and truly sympathize with a grieving mother. However because of some shots that are in very poor taste, the movie is an abysmal popcorn movie you would expect to be featured as a tv movie on SyFy. The shark is obviously fake and mechanical and is suffering from overexposure, watch the scene where they first see it.. you just feel this sense of let down because, there it is in all it's glory chomping away at the boat and everyone in the shot just stands there with their hands in their pockets like .. ""Oh there's a shark.. well isn't that weird"". But again, in their defense, it is so fake even the actors I'm sure had trouble pretending it was real.

The best part of this movie is the onscreen chemistry between Hogie and Ellen, it's wonderful to see that Ellen Brody has met someone and being all giddy; but then it is Michael Caine so I'm not sure how much of it was acting.

Michael Brody is the stupidest person on earth. He knows the moment he saw that shark that it came for him, the other guy was dangling his feet in the water for a long time and it didn't even try to get him, just in case you don't realize this, someone points it out later in the dialogue. He continually goes down in the water even though he knows the shark is there for him and even allows his daughter to go into the water.

Another thing worth pointing out is that whomever, handled this shark obviously had a sense of humor. The shark teeters from side to side like a drunk as it swims and even plays hide and seek growling all the way like a lion.

The lone scary moment of the movie comes when the eel scares Michael, that is actually a great shot. I think that Ellen's shoulder pads should have gotten mentioned in the credits, they date the movie and are heavily featured in this film.",1267747200,2,1914,4.308333333333334

1079406,2,6305814694,"This is a film about a shark that's contrary to pretty much everything we know about sharks. Jaws starts off in Amity Island (the location of the original film) on some sort of revenge-quest on the Brody family because they keep maiming, killing or otherwise blowing up the significant number of Great White sharks that seem to keep coming into their vicinity. Jaws gobbles up one of Chief Brody's sons (himself now a cop like his pop once was) and there's a lot of close-ups of some renegade piece of driftwood. We get the sense that Jaws somehow managed to use this piece of driftwood to lure Brody's kid a little closer to the water so he could snatch him and eat him up. This is ridiculous right from the get-go, but here it is in about the first ten minutes of the film. Sharks do not take things personally and they don't seek vengeance, but this is only one of the many facts about sharks that the filmmakers will ignore as we progress through this film.

Mrs. Brody (Lorraine Gary) gets very boo-hoo about this attack and decides to visit her other son who lives down in the Bahamas. Somehow, Jaws knows of this and follows her down to the Bahamas. Again, the likelihood of finding a Great White shark in the warm waters of the Bahamas is crazy unlikely, but as we've already seen, the filmmakers don't care much for things such as science or fact. So, Mrs. B tools around the islands and manages to hook up with Michael Caine, who's named after a sandwich for this movie (maybe not, but his name's Hoagie and all I can think of is the hoagie sandwich whenever he's on screen). In defiance of the otherwise talented cast on screen, Jaws manages to out-act them both when he shows just how cunning and crafty he is. See, Mrs. B's other son hasn't suffered enough trauma from being in the water, so he hangs out with Mario van Peebles (as Rasta, Mon!) and does science-y stuff in the ocean that has something or other to do with ocean life. Like I've said, the filmmakers don't care much for science or fact so what Mrs. B's kid and Mario van Rasta are doing in the ocean doesn't much matter. Anyways, Jaws does fun stuff like stop swimming to hide behind some coral or seaweed - only to jump out like some wacky aquatic ninja and eat up some more hopeless victims. Well, the filmmakers have completely thrown fact to the wind on this one because if a Great White stops swimming for even a minute, they die. They will essentially suffocate themself and drown. However, Jaws seems pretty able to manage sitting in idle while waiting for his prey to come directly to him.

Once Mrs. B realizes that Jaws has come to the Bahamas to get her and the rest of her family, she begins to lose her s--t royally. She takes off on her own revenge-quest against Jaws and they're supposedly destined to duke it out somewhere on the high seas. However, Jaws seems pretty easy to find since he's also gained the ability to roar... or growl... or whatever the heck sound he's making. Yep, you guessed it - once again, the filmmakers have thrown all logic and reason to the wind and have now made a Great White sound like a lion (in fact, this reminds me of the Simpsons episode where Captain Lance Murdoch had to jump over a water tank filled with piranhas, sharks, electric eels and a lion). Anyways, Mrs. B drives her boat out into the ocean to have a final showdown with Jaws. Hoagie shows up again and crashes his plane into the water and swims to the boat. Like many other reviewers have noted, even though Hoagie just came from the very wet ocean, none of his clothes appears to be the least bit damp. Why this has garnered such attention is beyond me. I mean, honestly, at this point in the film you've been asked to accept a roaring, revenge-minded shark that pounces on its prey from out of nowhere - why quibble about Hoagie's clothes?

Now Mrs. B and friends are ready to go mano-e-mano with the Great White and we're led to believe that Mario van Rasta buys the farm halfway through this nightmare at sea. After some more nonsense regarding things that sharks don't do, the climax builds up to the point where Jaws leaps a good 15-20 feet out of the water (apparently, he has also acquired the abilities of a dolphin. Maybe Jaws is a mystical shark that takes on the properties of whatever it eats for its own personal gain). Mrs. B and friends run the ship's prow directly into the beast and stabs it. That's right, she stabbed Jaws... with a boat... Cut to a growling, anguished Jaws as he flops about after being skewered like a Great White shish-ka-bob. He dies an embarassing death and everybody relaxes now that the nightmare is... finally... over...

Also, Mario van Rasta shows up after the shark is killed with a friendly ""Hey, mon!"" and everyone's all ha-ha as the credits roll.

This is the film in a nutshell and the installment that the Jaws series chose to end on (or maybe not chose, I'm sure the studio would've kept churning these things out if the audience hadn't breathed a collective ""give me a break"" sigh). Why Michael Caine is in this makes even less sense than a growling, stalker-esque Great White shark. I guess he was just slumming and figured a free trip to the Bahamas and a paycheck on top of it was a great way to finish out an Academy Award-winning year (he had won an Oscar whilst he was in the middle of filming Jaws 4). In the meantime, the filmmakers were able to top the sheer silliness of the previous entry (the one where Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. deal with sharky shenanigans at a Sea World-esque theme park... in 3D, no less!) whilst also soiling everyone's collective memory of Spielberg's original classic film.

In short, this is obviously a terrible film, but it does fall into the so-bad-it's-fun category and is even better to view when capping off another week of Shark Week on TV. With all the things you learn about sharks during Shark Week, watch this film and see just how many the filmmakers got wrong. All in all, go into this expecting exactly what you'd expect from the third sequel in a franchise and you won't be disappointed because ""Jaws 4"" delivers the silly in spades! However, if you're looking for a film that's along the same lines as Spielberg's original, well then... just go watch the first one again.

A sheriff gets his legs bitten off and yells ""Ow!""

A five year old (maybe older) asks her grandma (and I paraphrase) ""...now that Brody's (Mr. Ow!) dead, will he be coming back""?

A shark has presence of mind to call Liberty Travel and find out exactly where the Brody's are staying in The Bahamas.

An Aeroflot pilot watches and comes to love the scene where Michael Caine allows the five year old in his lap while piloting a multi-engine Cessna and do dive-bombing runs. Seven years later the captain of Aeroflot Flight 593 allows his 15 year old daughter to take the left seat, where upon she inadvertently disconnects the autopilot and the Airbus A-310 dice bombs into a Siberian mountain.

Ellen Brody gets very Billy/Sonny Landham from Predator and senses the shark just like Billy sensed the Rasta alien.

Said shark doesn't like ebing photographed and roars exactly like Spot from The Munsters whenever he's flashed.

For some reason the shark explodes when Ellen Brody puts on the proverbial strap-on and rams a ship's mast right down his throat.

Mario Van Peebles lives after being used as a chew-toy by said exploding shark.  Blood all over the place, but ole Mario's Rastafarian character is cracking wise, which is too bad because he is really, really annoying.  His death would have been a highlight of the flick.

So!  Do I recommend this?  Sure, why not?  Of course it's production value (except for the cinematography, thatpart is actually really nice) is worse than a first year undergrad film student.

1079409,5,6305814694,"I enjoyed this installment. People are quick to point out the negatives and neglect to compliment the positive.

Now this isn't Oscar material by any means but it is highly watchable and entertaining. What more do you want from a movie aside from an escape. Not every movie has to be a thinking film. First the cinematography looks amazing. The film still looks fresh, colorful and has a modern look to it (unlike the dated looking Jaws 3, and my least favorite of the bunch).

Second, the music sounds amazing and it has a killer opening title sequence. Next is the all important pacing which is quite good. It moves fast and never drags.

Compared to the last film I thought the acting was bumped up a notch with a higher caliber of talent . Michael Caine adds a touch of class and the rest of the actors play it straight and do a fine job. Also Lorraine Gary is back as the lead Ellen Brody where before she was just supporting, and she does a good job. People are upset over Ellen feeling a shark has a vendetta against her family, but she just lost her son. Maybe that caused her to go off her rocker a bit.

It was also refreshing seeing a subtle love story between Ellen and Hoagie as its rare to see any romance between people in the 50+ crowd anymore. I thought it had some suspenseful tense moments especially the underwater chase.

Yes the main problem here is the shark. It doesn't look as realistic as before and why couldn't they edit out those roaring noises. Also I wish the original ending had been included. It's not the greatest but definitely better than the nonsensical exploding shark and Jake coming back to life. The tone and ending of what was shown in theaters is better. Glad the original cover art is being used on be new blu Ray though !

All in all, this is a fun entertaining romp and is not as bad as people say . Everyone seems to jump on the bandwagon of this being the worst film ever and it's definitely not. There was some talent put into this although some mistakes were made in some areas but certainly not all that would warrant the severe annihilation this movie gets. If you want to call something the worst movie ever made - check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation which was atrocious in every department with no redeeming features.

To be honest, I don't know what people are complaining about, this was an enjoyable film. I don't find a shark out for revenge against one particular family an impossible, implausible plot device. ""Twister"" made no sense (attach leather belts to a pipe and hold on real tight and you'll be safe, and heck, you'll also get to see the inside of the dang thing!) and yet that made money. A shark roaring? Who cares? If we were scientifically correct in every single film, all the outer space fight scenes in ""Star Wars"", ""Moonraker"" and ""Star Trek"" would be completely boring without the lasers and explosions to accompany the scenes. Same thing goes for the shark traveling from New England to the Bahamas (and surviving) in a short amount of time.

Second, how the shark died. Now before I get negative remarks, I did do my research on this and all the Jaws films, so I do know about how there was negative audience reaction to the character Jake dying, but I digress. When I saw this movie on TV, there was opening narration as the shark made its way into the town and, I can't really remember but I swear there was a different ending. The shark's head still explodes but it wasn't by ramming the boat into it (and seeing the shark and boat model). Why have two slightly different versions been released? I don't know but now I have to tape this movie again just to make sure I'm not crazy.

1079413,4,6305814694,"If you like bad horror movies then this is your Jaws movie. Dare I say, it might just be my favorite. The first one is absolutely terrifying. I mean it still causes generations of people to be afraid of going in the water. What other movie has that impact? The second one was just trying to capitalize on the first one. The third one was gimicky with some pretty bad 3D effects. And then there's this one.

It's full of inconsistencies and just absolute non-sense. Just read the other reviews. They got it right on. But this movie has a charm that just appeals to me. As a kid it was my favorite because it almost plays like a cartoon. The roaring shark. The sharks ability to stand on end. The fact that during most of the shark chase sequences the cables and track are clearly visible.

But I think what makes this movie appealing is actually how bad it is. If you rent Shark Attack 2, or Sharks in Venice your expecting crap. Jaws the revenge is like a pleasant surprise. Sure the first time you watch it, your mouth is agape by what you are watching. But after that, it grows on you. Like athlete's foot.

1079439,2,6305814694,"This film, the fourth in a franchise inspired by Peter Benchley's novel ""Jaws"" could be used by either the MST3K crew for episode fodder or by a film school to show how not to make an action-adventure film.

The fact that scenes from the original and far superior ""Jaws"" are spliced into this film might make the viewer rush to eject this film and watch Spielberg's first blockbuster.  Nevertheless, the film is good stupid fun if you really have nothing better to do.

The film starts with Mrs. Brody's youngest son Sean (the baby on the beach in the original and the kid on the sailboat in the second) being attacked and killed at night by (presumably) a Great White shark.  Mrs. Brody is inconsolable, and she orders her other son, Mike, to stop working as a marine biologist in the Bahamas.  He invites her to visit him partly because he's concerned about her mental state and partly to assuage her fears that he will soon become the victim of a shark attack.

She goes to the Bahamas and meets a single pilot named Hoagie (played by Michael Caine).  She seems to sense that a Great White is lurking nearby and, sure enough, Mike is stalked through a sunken ship by one and her granddaughter is nearly eaten while riding a banana boat on the beach.  Interestingly enough, the boat used in this film is located in 60 feet of water off the shore of Nassau, Bahamas, and local dive stores use it for wreck dives.  I dove this wreck in 1998.

Mrs. Brody decides to take matters into her own hands and kill the shark herself so she steals her son's boat.  Hoagie and Mike find her (spotting the boat and shark from Hoagie's plane) and they all battle the shark before the film's glorious conclusion: the shark being impaled on the bowsprit of the boat.

The fact that in many scenes the shark is so obviously fake so as to make one's eyes roll is one reason the film was panned.  Secondly, Mrs. Brody has flashbacks to events she did not personally witness (Chief Brody's killing the original shark and her son Sean's death as examples); even Roger Ebert pointed this glaring flaw out.

If you want a stupid shark movie, this will do unless you watch ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"" which is even more stupid.",1219536000,,2204,4.505025125628141

It swims across the world to hunt down the Brody family. This film makes no explanation for everything but that's the beauty of it.

Jaws The Revenge is so awful it defies the English language.

Being a fan of the first two Jaws films, I initially hoped that The Revenge would at least attempt to do them justice. Not a chance. I feel that the writers were in fact mocking my brain capacity by releasing this film with more flaws than a really bad face-lift.

Evidently this long line of sharks really has it in for remaining Brody family because this dried up tuna follows the remaining Brody family to the Bahamas where I must mention, Great White Sharks commonly avoid. How and why this shark feels the need to follow the family around the circumference of the earth is beyond me, and something better off ignored. The shark looked like a withered old balloon and the scares were null and void. Jaws the Revenge completely destroyed what was so compelling about the first two films and left me with nothing but a headache.

1079466,1,6305814694,"Folks heed my words, there is nothing, and I mean NOTHING good about this movie. Not only do I not believe I could sit through this whole movie in one sitting, I am amazed that good money was wasted to make this. When the film was being made did ANYONE ask ""Is this movie going to entertain anyone??""

The plot is ridiculous and beyond coherent thought. In Amity Mrs. Brody's son gets killed by a shark. He is in a boat trying to free a log from a buoy, when a Great White leaps from the water and snaps off an arm. After yelling for help and going into an almost believable panic, the shark returns to finish him off. Mrs. Brody is convinced that this shark is on a mission to kill her entire family.

So she goes to the Bahamas to stay with her other son for awhile. He is a marine biologist who studies the mating of conch snails. Mario Van Peebles is his over cliched Jamaican partner. Michael Cane comes along for the ride to as a pilot who woos Mrs. Brody.

The shark somehow knows all this and the killer great white from the frozen Atlantic travels to the warm clear waters of the Carribean. It then attacks a banana boat with Mrs. Brody's 5 year old granddaughter. Mrs Brody has had enough, she decides to get on a boat, head out into the water, and be eaten by the shark ""It's the only way!!!"" she exclaims.

Of course Michael Cane and her son come to her rescue in an airplane. Of course the shark attacks and eats the plane, that's a given. Now the anti-climatic finale of this film is a roaring shark getting zapped by a Black and Decker flashlight. I'm not even going to explain this. It is stunned long enough for the boat to ram into the shark CAUSING IT TO EXPLODE! I rewound it to make sure I got it right, and yes the shark exploded.

Now you know a sequel is on very weak legs when you are about to kill the shark and the screen shows flashbacks of the shark getting killed in the first Jaws.

This is by far the worst Jaws movie of the franchise and is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. I honestly cannot understand anyone who would watch this movie twice. Even those who love Jaws and want a complete collection would not watch this. For the rest of us, stick with Jaws and Jaws 2. It's all you need.",1192838400,4,2232,4.191142191142191
1079467,1,6305814694,"As the film's title identifies, our legendary shark menace can hone in on blood from miles away- hundreds of miles in fact, notably alighting upon a particular target residing upon the shore. Did the Brody's simply leave a trail of chum from Martha's Vineyard to the Bahamas; perhaps Hoagie dropped it from his plane. Nevermind. Jaws in his ravenous hunger bore that vehicle to the seafloor.

Nevertheless, one can't help but gape at the sheer prowess of Spielburg's instrument of cinematic horror. Jaws defies the fallibility of such creatures as Dracula, slain by the heart-driven steak, the Wolfman, silenced by a silver bullet, or even the impermeable blob, suspended in animation. Not only can the sea's greatest killing machine withstand being blown up, electrocuted, and subsequently blown up while striking fear into tourists at a local SeaWorld, he rises once more to exact revenge upon his land-based nemeses, the indefatigable Brodys. It's no wonder that he now exhibits a tendency to roar, lavish the warm Carribean waters, an alien and inhospitable environment for a great white, as well as spontaneously explode after leaping twenty feet from a water depth of less than ten, having been impaled upon a wooden prow.

Yet, Jaws: The Revenge deserves as yet unaccounted-for credit. The extraordinarily large prehistoric beast fortunately lacks the imbued twenty-five cent arcade qualities of the shark of Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. We, as an audience, are allowed to view retro Jaws in his classic fury, striking fear into beachgoers and boaters, young and old alike. Furthermore, we see genuine character development in the interactions between the adult Michael Brody and his young daughter.

Unfortunately, who lies out on the sofa to watch a Jaws film that depicts human character as opposed to human casualties? How can a horror/thriller genre sport sappy relationships and love-making welders? Therein lies the inherent flaw of Jaws: The Revenge. Take a hint from South Park- if you've got to kill the main character every installment, produce a comedy. Don't straddle a blunt line between frightening, fruity, and downright ridiculous.",1187136000,,2159,5.270348837209302
1079468,1,6305814694,"It's no accident that there never was another ""Jaws"" movie after Jaws the Revenge.  Even the movie Deep Blue tried hard to avoid being thought of as Jaws 5.  Why is that?

Probably because this sorry piece of filming terminated the giant shark in more ways than one.  It's NO exaggeration, whatsoever, to say that this film works better as an unintentional comedy than as a horror/science-fiction movie.

If you are thinking of renting or, heaven forbid, buying this movie I will refer you to something that lambasts this movie better than I can.  Do a you tube search for ""richard jeni jaws 4"" and you'll find a short entertaining video that gives Jaws the Revenge a proper mockery.

1079469,1,6305814694,"I just saw the end of JAWS: THE REVENGE again on latenight cable TV--where it belongs--and I'm still stunned by the incredible lameness of every aspect of this movie.  For everyone who quibbles about the unlikelihood of finding a Great White in the warm waters of the Bahamas: this shark also roars.  Like a lion or something.  A roaring shark.  You read that right.

The filmmakers also keep cutting shots from the original JAWS into the climax.  As a reminder that there was actually a good film at one time here?  A distraction from how horrible this one is?

They paid Michael Caine enough to be in this stink bomb--but obviously not enough to wear a wet shirt after climbing out of the ocean.  His expressions often convey that he's there but you're lucky he's at least facing the camera.

Was there something better he could have been doing?  Yes.  Picking up his first Oscar for HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  But he missed the Oscars to be in JAWS: THE REVENGE.  At least he went on national TV to admit that he did this movie because he had a home right there in the Bahamas (he even pointed at the house during the interview).

The demise of the roaring shark is a baffling, badly-edited violation of all of our natural laws and logic.  Shark rises out of the water.  Boat rams shark.  Shark explodes.  Boat explodes.  Everyone survives, even the annoying Jamaican who got chewed up several minutes before.  Roll footage clearly the same of the blown-up shark sinking from the original.

Wow.  It's that bad.

The tag line for this movie was ""This time it's personal.""

1079470,1,6305814694,"After a Great White shark kills her youngest son, the widowed Ellen Brody comes to the realization that the shark is after her and her loved ones. As ridiculous of this might sound, it turns out that she's right. The vengeful, grudge-holding fish follows the grieving woman along with her son, daugther-in-law and niece to the beautiful Bahamas, I guess to seek revenge? For what, you ask? I have no idea.

The scathing reviews this film has received from those who have watched it are justified because this film is unbearably bad. The film-makers thought that in order to make a ""Jaws"" sequel, the story must involve the Brody family. In ""Jaws 2"", Chief Brody battled another over-grown Great White and in ""Jaws 3"", the Brody sons battled an even bigger shark in Florida's Sea World. In ""Jaws: The Revenge"", the homicidal fish returns to torment the Brody's yet again. Talk about an unlucky family. What I do not understand is why is this shark after them? Didn't the shark die in the original film? Didn't the second shark die during the sequel's climax? Is this shark somehow related to the previous sharks; maybe a spouse or a sibling or a cousin? Maybe it wanted to avenge the murder of its relatives? Maybe ""Bruce"" was somehow resurrected and the scene ended up in the cutting room floor? *ScratchesHead* Help?

Another intriguing factor in ""Jaws: The Revenge"" is that the shark roars. Mighty ""Bruce"" roars just like the T-Rex in Jurassic park and if that wasn't enough, it can also jump out of the water and stand on its tail, kinda like Flipper. I was waiting for Michael Caine to throw it a Mackerel and ask it to do a back-flip. Speaking of Michael Caine, he gives the most annoying performance of his entire career.

All kidding aside, ""Jaws: The Revenge"" is definitely the worst film in the series (yes, even worse than ""Jaws 3"") and qualifies as probably one of the worst sequels ever made. The acting is not too bad (Michael Caine being the exception) and I have to give credit where credit is due because you can tell that Lorraine Gary and Lance Guest were taking their roles very seriously and it's a testament to their talents that they were able to keep a straight face throughout this film.

The film's horrible climax only adds insult to injury. After her niece was nearly eaten up by the hungry fish, Ms. Brody decides to seek and kill it by herself without any weapons of any kind whatsoever. What was she expecting to do, run the shark over with her boat? (I was recently informed by a fellow movie buff that Ms. Brody was actually going to sacrifice herself to the shark so Mr. Great White can leave her family alone. Huh? It is not made clear in the film so I guess the viewer can decide for themselves what the clueless Ms. Brody was attempting to do)

There are 2 endings to this film, both nonsensical, both equally bad. The original ending, which I saw at the theatre back in 1987, had ""Bruce"" being impaled by the boat. After the film's release and for Home Video, the ending was changed and had the beast mysteriously explode upon impact. Explode, you ask? Yes, explode. Why? I have no freakin' idea. As much as I hated the first ending, the revised version is far worse and I urge you all to use the handy freeze-frame feature in your DVD/BluRay players to see just how bad this effect is. They also had Mario Van Peebles' character miraculously come back from the dead which mean this instalment has the lowest body count in the series.

From the lame plot to the lame, plastic, roaring killer shark to Michael Caine's utterly charmless performance, ""Jaws:The Revenge"" is a travesty and an insult to the original film classic. Not even the gorgeous Bahamas locale can save this. At least Michael Caine got a house out of it. The viewer is not as lucky. Skip it and re-watch the original instead.

1079500,1,6305814694,"Steven Spielberg's classic masterpiece JAWS did not have a stellar plot.  It was a bubblegum storyline: a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast.  In the hands of any other director, it would have been a terrible film, something to laugh at on lonely Saturday nights while chowing down popcorn.  In the hands of Mr. Spielberg, however, it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made.

Steven Spielberg's hands were nowhere near JAWS: THE REVENGE.

Okay, so here's the plot.  Remember JAWS 3-D?  Well, that never happened.  Chief Brody - from the first movie - is dead.  His wife, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), is living a happy life in Amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark.  Ellen flies down to the Bahamas with her other son, Michael Brody (Lance Guest).  Though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy, Ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes, the one that Chief Brody killed - is back for revenge, hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one.  Even though it died.  In the first movie.

Confused?  Any sensible moviegoer would be.  It's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third JAWS sequel.  As you now know, the story is completely absurd.  The script, by Michael De Guzman, is unintentionally hilarious, filled with outrageously funny dialogue.  For example, in one scene, pilot Hoagie (played by Michael Caine!) is courting Ellen Brody.

HOAGIE: I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.

ELLEN: Why?

HOAGIE: Because ... it would not occur to you why.

And if that's not confusing enough for you, feast upon this nugget of dialogue, from a conversation between Michael and Ellen Brody.

ELLEN: Why did you come out here?  Why did you come out here?

MICHAEL: Mom!  Mom!  WHY did you take the boat?

ELLEN: It [the shark] kept coming!

MICHAEL: Don't you realize what you're doing?

ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, there was nothing else to do!

MICHAEL: Mom, you shouldn't have done it.

ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, I've tried!

Joseph Sargent's directing is terrible; it's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing.  Which may be why the acting is so horrible.  The highlight of the cast is Lance Guest, whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented Michael Caine's by a longshot.  The horrid acting is forgivable, however; after all, how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd?  A film in which sharks roar, swim from New England to the Bahamas to kill family members, and leap thirty feet out of the water?

On the plus side, JAWS: THE REVENGE is enormously fun to watch, thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity.  It is very likely one of the worst films ever made - JAWS 3-D looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there's nothing else on TV some late night, grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is JAWS: THE REVENGE.",1151971200,7,2998,4.701348747591522

-'Jaws: The Revenge' is knockoff of 'Orca'.  You just think about that for a while.  This is disturbing for a variety of reasons, not the least of which being that 'Orca' was a knockoff of 'Jaws', and is also the stupidest movie ever made, with the possible exception of.... 'Jaws: The Revenge'.

-I first saw this movie when I was a little kid.  I thought about it occasionally over the years reflecting on how at the end of the film the shark kinda floats on top of the water on his tail and is impaled on the mast, or whatever, of the ship.  Eventually, after a number of years, I became convinced that I had imagined this.  It was just too stupid to be real.  No frickin' way.  Then I saw this movie again a while back and sure enough the ending happened just as a remembered it.  All this comes together to mean that the ending of this film is so stupid that it is literally beyond belief.  That's somethin'

-The shark in this movie roars.  Many others have mentioned this, but it bears repeating.  This is another thing I'd forgotten.  After being reminded of it today I nearly fell over laughing.

-Also, the shark is really, really amusing looking.  His sides are all wiggly like he's made out of carpet or something and hasn't got a skeleton.

Jaws 2 is a weak follow up that is only tolerable if you can edit out all the scenes with the teenagers (at least until the end when the become necessary to the story).  Jaws 3-D is just a bad movie that also looks grainy and bad due to the crapfest 3-D.  Now on to Jaws: The Revenge.  This is so bad it is hard to describe.  It is Plan 9 From Outer Space/Ed Wood bad.  The plot is stupid, the shark stands up and roars like a lion.  Ellen Brodies hair is scarier than the shark!

I recently saw this on Sci Fi channel and they have now inserted some kind of ridiculous read over narrative about unexplained events.  Sharks don't follow people from New York to the Bahamas even in the Twilight Zone.",1139702400,2,746,4.089655172413793
1079504,1,6305814694,"Oh god help us. Did they learn nothing from the abomination that was Jaws III?

Memorable moments of this film include:

- Michael Cain crashing his aircraft into the sea, then climbing onboard the nearby boat sporting a dry, beautifully pressed shirt.

- The 'shark' moving towards Lance Guest just far enough to be able to see the train tracks behind it.

- The 'shark' standing up out of the water (a reminder: Robert Shaw stated that the shark in the original Jaws was approximately 3 tons)

- Quote: The Shark - ""Roooooaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!""

God knows what Michael Cain was thinking when he agreed to take part in this tragic moment in film history - maybe he got the impression he was making a spoof sequel (which incidentally, Jaws III was originally supposed to be).

Consider this film the textbook example of why not to make sequels. In fact, the only good thing in its legacy is that no further ones have been made (nearly twenty years now). In the light of this, I implore any hopefuls - in the name of all that is holy, Don't.",1139356800,4,1050,4.612903225806452
1079505,1,6305814694,"I cannot understand for the life of me, why on earth this garbage can of a film was bothered with. And they thought they could make some money SIMPLY because the name ""JAWS"" is in the title! The men and women who wrote this slop must have gotten drunk on bottles of 'apricot brandy' before starting on the script.

Some time before the film, the Brody family lost dad and husband Martin to a heart attack, but they still live in Amity. Now it's just son Sean and Mom, Ellen Brody; older son Michael is in the Bahamas. It's near Christmas, and Sean is now part of the Amity Police. After hanging out with his mom, he heads out for a night harbour patrol to check up on some floating debris, and as he inspects one piece of wood in the water, (oh, surprise, surprise) a meaty great white shark comes along to chow down on Sean. Within moments, he becomes the film's first victim....and to our surprise, a Brody family member actually gets the full chomp and gulp treatment. Oh well, you lived through the other three films kid. See ya.

Mrs. Brody goes into shock, and older son Mike arrives in Amity with his little family. After the funeral, she decides to go back to the Bahamas with them. Well, wouldn't you know it? The shark follows them all the way there. I thought only dogs follow people. Did the shark happen to ask a travel agent where the Brody's were going? What's really stupid is that the shark arrives in Bahama waters in, oh, I'd say record time for a rocket powered speed boat.

This film's first half hour already has a lot going against it. ""Jaws The Revenge"" as a title sounds more like a mafia movie. A shark seeking revenge? Why not simply ""Jaws 4"", or for a chuckle, ""Jaws The Bahama Beast""? The acting is much like an afternoon soap opera, complete with overdramatic scenes, and awful lines. I hate to admit it, but the opening credits with the sharks point of view swimming through the water near piers and boats at night are really neat, and this movie doesn't deserve that sequence.

Mike is played by Lance Guest (The Last Starfighter), and the once well acted Lorraine Gary is Ellen Brody. Michael Caine is perhaps the biggest shock in this film (is he crazy?!) as he plays island pilot Hoagie who starts to fall in love with his movie paycheque-I MEAN MRS. BRODY!

Although Ellen Brody has bad dreams of becoming attacked by a great white, the family cheer her up with all the island fun. But as the shark makes it's appearance, it takes a victim who rides a banana boat-weenie ride that Mike's little girl is on as well (I guess it took the rubber raft for a real banana). Mike's daughter just missed the bite, but that close call gets Mike and his Mom mad.

This time around, 'Bruce' (the mechanical shark's nickname) looks so beat up and old, that you'll laugh at least a few times when you see it's rubber skin peeling off, and hear it's gears grinding. Guess he's been (a) rusting on some Universal lot for a few years, and (b) wasn't patched up from his burning in Jaws 2 (remember that?)

What happens in the end? No matter how horrible this movie is, I won't spoil the HILARIOUS ending, but I will say the climax reveals roaring sounds from the shark's mouth (the funniest moment of them all) and Michael Caine, along with Mario Van Peebles and Lance Guest, takes his plane and makes a ludicrous crash landing on the water next to Mrs. Brody's yacht, who's in hot pursuit of the big fish. You know she wants the credit of killing the shark herself. ""REVENGE!""

What would have made this movie even more hilarious, is if the shark 'constantly' tried to attack the Brody's in the water, and ended up eating nearby swimming lifeguards or divers by the numbers instead. At least there would be a lot of funny close calls....and the shark would be fed quite well.

There's nothing you can do now, except pretend that the third and this fourth awful Jaws film never happened. The first was a classic, and the second wasn't bad. ""Jaws The Revenge"" is such trash, and yet I'm one of those people who, if by chance has absolutely nothing to do one night, and is in need of a big laugh, will watch this...and only for that reason. Since the kill ratio is really pitiful, how about one last title suggestion...""Jaws: Underfed"".",1136246400,6,4253,4.470360824742268

Cast:  Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest, Mario Van Peebles, Michael Caine, Karen Young, Judith Barsi, Lynn Whitfield, Mitchell Anderson.

Running Time:  89 minutes

Rated PG-13 for shark violence, gore, and language.

Another unnecessary and ridiculous sequel of another horror series, ""Jaws: The Revenge"" attempts to cap off the shark versus the Brody family in intense, atmopheric Spielberg fashion.  Director Joseph Sargent; however, is not Steven Spielberg and the film certainly shows it.  Sheriff Brody (played brilliantly by Roy Scheider in the original ""Jaws"") has been dead for some years, his sons have grown, and his wife (once again played the comatose, lathargic Lorraine Gary) has tried to move on, but she now fears the water and still has nightmares. Her son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), now a cop at Amity is killed one night in the water, and Ellen decides to visit Michael (Lance Guest), her other son on a Caribbean island. Ellen believes her family is haunted by sharks and wants her son to stop working with them as he now has a family of his own to look after. He will not believe her, but a great white attacks him and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles). They escape, but decide to investigate; meanwhile Ellen is falling for local Pilot, Hoagie (Michael Caine). Soon though it becomes clear that the shark is after the family and Ellen decides to find and destroy the shark as she cannot get on with her life and must protect remaining members of her family, and Mike, Jake and Hoagie follow.

There are some moderately good performances here, but they hardly are special.  Lorraine Gary and Lance Guest are solid as the Brody family, while Van Peebles is good and provides some banter. Caine looks like he is having fun, it is the Bahamas after all, and he probably was paid well. There are a couple of good moments:  the banana boat scene and the shark following Mike into the sunken ship, yet ""Jaws: The Revenge"" resembles nothing that the original 1975 classic embraced.  A poor finish to the series, but then again not much new could really be done to spice things up.",1135900800,3,2117,4.814917127071824
1079507,1,6305814694,That title says it all. you don't need to know that the shark chases the last member of the Brody family halfway around the world after hunting down and killing off the rest of her family.

1079508,3,6305814694,"This final entry in the JAWS franchise is as expected pretty ludicrous and nowhere near as good as the original movie.  But it's better than 2 and 3, so that's a start.  This time, Lorraine Gary is now a widow (not really sure what happened to Roy Scheider?), and her youngest son is killed by a great white on Christmas Eve.  She thinks the shark came back (I thought it got exploded twice?) for revenge.  Her oldest son (Lance Guest) persuades her to come visit him in the Bahamas to help heal the wounds.  She wants him to stop working in the water, but he's a scientist studying of all things snails and he doesn't want to give it up.  Gary meets and falls for suave pilot Michael Caine (He'll do anything it seems), and just when things start looking up, here comes the great white to wreak havoc again.  It's all pretty silly and Mario van Peebles is simpy awful as the rastaman associate.  The IMDB says Peebles wrote his own dialogue; what a crime--it's terrible.  So why 3 stars?  It's entertaining in a pedestrian manner and one can't help but root for Gary when she finally confronts her demon again.

1079551,1,6305814694,"The animal being stupid JAWS movies and the food supply being stupid viewers who don't know any better!

Would you believe Michael Caine did not show up at the 1987 Oscars to receive his award for HANNAH AND HER SISTERS because he was on location filming this dud?  He said in an interview once that he took the job because he got a beach house in the Bahamas as an incentive.  Perhaps I can't blame him for that.

When I think of really bad sequels, so many wonderful titles come to mind; GREASE 2, ROCKY IV, POLTERGEIST II, HALLOWEEN 4,5,6,7,8 etc.  And while personnaly, the Oscar will always go to ROCKY IV, I cannot resist the urge to tear JAWS: THE REVENGE to little pieces!

Suddenly you hear a voice from the TV say, ""Hey, stupid, you're watching a movie that is trying to convince you that a great white shark would swim halfway around the world to the Bahamas to take revenge on one particular family!

1079552,1,6305814694,"I remember first seeing Jaws-The Revenge when I was around [...]. I was a big fan of sharks and luckily, my parents were cool enough to let me watch the original Jaws and sequels at such a young age. The first two movies in the series were wonderful. Maybe it was the 70's atmosphere, and the fact that no film maker had ever really covered the ""killer shark"" view on the big screen-but, the first two movies were scary! The third movie tried to hit it big by going 3-D which just makes the film's overall appearance look grainy and blurry. Jaws 3-D was actually even worse than the mess they created with this movie. The only slightly good thing about the movie is the character developement. We are comfortable as movie viewers watching the Brody family, who have endured numerous shark attack scenarios, and aside from Elaine Gray's lopsided hairdoo, we enjoy seeing what's left of the Brody family interact. The mechanical shark in this movie is so bad that it is actually unexplainable. It literally moves so slow that anyone who knows how to at least swim laps could outswim it in the water. There are only two scenes in this movie that are slightly scary-but the slow, OVERLY exposed shark pretty much ruins it for the moviegoer. My biggest issue with this movie though is that I am confused about why the Brody family even goes around water at all anymore?!? Mike Brody works in the water constantly-which is odd since he has been in ALL of the movies and has been attacked on numerous occasions. Why not just find a career away from the sea? I live in Ohio and have only been to the ocean a couple times but, I know that If i DID live by the ocean, and a vengeful shark seemed to want to ruin my life, I would simply MOVE. The shark can't come up on land, so it's not that big of a deal. It's so sad that they have let this series go downhill so bad. If they ever do make a sequel they should really do a LOT of research and come up a halfway decent plot that doesnt involve a shark that is seeking out revenge. One more sad fact about this movie is that the young girl who played Thea (and also provided the voice of DUCKY in THE LAND BEFORE TIME)-Mike Brody's daughter-was tragically murdered by her father shortly after this movie was made.",1131235200,17,2252,4.37708830548926
1079553,5,6305814694,"This is probably my favorite movie; I try to watch it at least twice a week. Like, if it's Saturday night and my wife says ""Let's go out for a romantic night on the town"" and I've only managed to watch it once that week, or once and then only part of the way through a second time, I say ""no way; I'm watching Jaws: The Revenge!!!"" or ""no; I've got to watch the rest of this movie!"" Before I saw this movie I would think a shark after my family would sound stupid. BEFORE that is! Now I'm so scared of water--in any form, I can scarcely bathe! If someone says ""water under the bridge,"" I scream. I couldn't even drink water until recently I was so terrified. I started drinking Gatorade and energy drinks and I was so hopped up on energy that one day I went to get the mail and never came back. And then I was hit by a car! I was put in the hospital and when my wife and my cats came to visit I requested that my wife bring the movie for me to watch in my hospital room and she refused! I was so furious! She said that ""Jaws: The Revenge"" was getting between us and I said ""Woman! Bring that film before I miss out on the finely articulated acting of Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell as ""Doc"" Holliday and Wyatt Earp!"" I had to settle for ""Shark Attack 3: Megaladon"" on the Sci-Fi channel and it was so stupid!

1079554,1,6305814694,"It's never a good sign when the blurb on the front of the box makes you burst into mocking laughter. Some tag-lines in movies are classics, and are as famous as the movies themselves. You know what I mean..

""In Space No One Can Hear You Scream"" from Alien.
""Crime Is A Disease. Meet The Cure"" from Cobra.
""Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid"" from The Fly.
""He Is The Master Of Quack Fu"" from Howard The Duck.

OK, not really the last one. But you get the idea, so when you see Jaws IV, with ""this time its personal"" you can't help but laugh. So, there's a shark out there pi**ed off at the whole Brody family for killing.. uh, I dunno, his family? So he hunts down said family, one by one (ignoring other swimmers!) in an attempt to get revenge.

Ahem. No, really.

Now, I'm sorry, there's a lot of things I'm willing to accept in movies - but that's just a step too far into ""stupid"" for me. All was missing were scenes of the shark down in his lair, shaking his fin upwards towards the surface shouting ""I'll get you for this, Brody!""

It makes NO sense. Not one little bit. Especially when the whole family MOVES from New York to the Bahamas - and the shark follows them! How did it know they were going? Did it tap their phones? Read their mail?

Tellingly, Roy Scheider is nowhere to be seen in this movie, leaving it all up to his boring wife to handle the stalking shark. And Michael Caine pops up too, for pretty much no reason other than to tell us, ""phwoar, that shark's breath stinks.""

Oh, and speaking of the shark - he roars like a lion in this movie. Not once, but a handful of times. I didn't know sharks could do that. Then again, I didn't know sharks bore grudges over the deaths of family members from over 10 years ago either. Learn something new every day, eh?

Lastly, the director has the shark ""popping"" out of the water so much it starts to wear a little thin. In the first film, when the shark pops out of the water it's a jump out of the seat moment, and clue that indeed Sherrif Brody is ""gonna need a bigger boat"". Here, the shark is almost like one of those whack-a-mole games.

A complete waste of time. Don't be tempted.

  ELLEN BRODY (again played by Lorraine Gary) is still living in her house in Amity Island. Living with her is her youngest son, SEAN BRODY (played by Mitchell Anderson). Sean is engaged to be married. He plans to marry his fiance, TIFFANY (played by Mary Smith) sometime in January, the following year. Right now, they are about to celebrate Christmas. Sean is now a deputy, where Martin Brody, his father, had worked. Martin Brody had sadly died of a heart attack, some years ago. His obsession with a possible third shark entering Amity and wrecking havoc again had caused heart attack.

  The next night, Ellen is leaving work with one of her co-workers. She meets up with Sean and Tiffany. Sean has to stop by the office for a while, while Ellen and Tiffany go out and get a Christmas tree. Sean gets a call about some sort of tie up of some wiring in the middle of the ocean. As he tries to untangle the mess, a great white shark comes up out of nowhere and kills Sean. Ellen Brody is in a deep depression. MICHAEL BRODY (played by Lance Guest) has just arrived from the Bahamas. Michael has been living in the Bahamas with his wife, CARLA (played by Karen Young), and their adorable little daughter, THEA (played by newcomer, Judith Barsi). Michael, Carla, and Thea stay for two days to attend Sean's funeral. The next day, Michael, Carla, and Thea have to return  to the Bahamas, where at that moment, Michael suggests that Ellen go with them to help overcome her grief. She had already lost her husband to a heart attack, and now she has lost her youngest son to a shark. Carla and Thea love the idea of Ellen going home with them, where Ellen decides to go.

  Flying them on a jet the rest of the way is HOAGIE NEWCOMBE (played by Michael Caine). Hoagie is a very generous man. They arrive at the Bahamas, where Ellen has her fears of the shark that killed Sean. She totally disagrees with Michael's work, where he works underwater, looking breeds of snails. There, Ellen meets Michael's co-worker, JAKE (played by Mario Van Peebles) and his wife, LOUISA (played by Lynn Whitfield). Both Jake and Louisa are very close friends with Michael, Carla, and Hoagie, and they happily befriend Ellen.

  Some days later, Hoagie takes Ellen out on a little day of fun, trying to provide more help for her to get over Sean's death. Ellen finds herself falling in love with Hoagie, as Hoagie is with her. At that moment, Michael and Jake find an unusual discovery...a great white shark. The shark takes a bite out of their boat and heads on his way. A great white shark is unusual in the Bahamas since the water there is very warm and sharks can't take the warm water. This great white shark is Sean's killer. The shark has followed the Brody's to the Bahamas. Michael and Jake decide not to say anything about this.

  A week later, while Ellen, Carla, Louisa, and Thea are on the beach while Carla is being awarded for a sculpture she had welded. Carla decides to let Thea ride with her friends on a banana boat. As she is being awarded, the shark appears and attacks the banana boat, where one of the girls' mothers is killed. Thea is fine, but is in severe shock, forcing Ellen to take Michael's boat and head out to destroy this shark once and for all. Michael returns home and finds Carla and Louisa comforting Thea, which is where Michael comes clean of his knowing of the shark. Michael and Jake head out to find Ellen, with the help of Hoagie flying them over to spot her easily. Michael, Hoagie, and Jake find Ellen and climb aboard, where Jake is bitten by the shark and taken down. With Michael and Hoagie's help, Ellen kills the shark off, in revenge of the death of her husband and youngest son. At that moment, the boat tips over and dumps, Michael, Hoagie, and Ellen out into the water, where Jake appears, injured, but still alive. Looks Jake will survive.

that scene where the shark eats the guys arm in the beginning and he screams and no one hears him and then he goes under again and again is just as terrifying as some of the other scenes in the movie. and sharks can actually travel from place to place. they don't just say that in the movies. read up on sharks. they're quite interesting creatures. the movie also made me laugh too at times.",1109203200,,572,4.035398230088496
1079595,5,6305814694,"Jaws is simply the greatest monster movie, and it is also a great film on many levels, and considering its worldwide notoriety, I won't go off on that tangent.

Jaws 2 is simply a low grade remake.

I have the distinct pleasure in saying that I have seen all the Jaws movies at the theater, some of them on opening day. As a fan of sharks and movies, its an addition I suppose considering that I have also rented everything at Blockbuster that has a shark on the cover or in the title. My expertise on the genre is admittedly self proclaimed, but if I get some business cards stating as such, maybe my following review with have greater credence.

Jaws 3 is a very bad movie. Starting with the writing, production, acting, horrific 3D effects and most notably, a waste of a big shark gone amuck in Sea World. The hope that the shark will take control of the park is the only redeming value of the story, but that is dashed. Why didn't the shark eat at least 4 of those show waterskiers? Because it is a very bad movie. The shark is right behind them when they fall, but they get out of the water just in time. The opportunity to turn the Jaws movies into a dynasty was destroyed here. Let the shark feed and live in a controlled habitat. Up until 2004, there had never been a great white shark held in captivity for more than two weeks. This movie could have served as a platform for shark observation and debauchery. This movie could have allowed the importance of shark preservation to be its theme, while showing numerous attacks of workers accidently falling into the water, the shark occassionally breaking out or maybe the brakes fail on a tour bus and it flies into the lagoon. Now thats entertainment with numerous possiblities. But noooo!

Jaws 4 on the other hand at the very least has good people eating scenes. Granted this shark has issues and the motivation of the shark to seek revenge against the Brody family is laughable, it does at least provide laughs. And I suppose some food for thought, sharks are people too. It also provides Micheal Caine falling for Mrs. Brody, proving there is life after the unfortanate loss of Chief (shark killer) Brody, as well as letting us witness the grown Brody kid get eaten. The special effects are better than Jaws 3, and the attacks are more frequent. Shark movies need to have shark attacks, and Jaws 4 delivers. I give this 5 stars as only a comparison to Jaws 3, when compared to Jaws it gets ZERO.

Sure its disappointing that the shark gets blown up in the original film, but this is argueably the only movie that is better than the book.",1108771200,,2599,4.463157894736842

C'mon. Sharks plotting revenge? For no apparent reason against a particular family? It's also very amusing in the way it tries to insert useless cameos and irrelevant flashbacks from the first film in order to spruce up and blind the viewers to what can only be considered a monumental travesty, especially with such a great actor like Michael Caine playing a guy named...Hoagie. Personally, I don't know what was more hideous, the fake shark or Lorraine Gary.

1079686,3,6305814694,"At least now we get back to the basics in this one. The 3rd film was terrible, as it went away from the sea and brought the killer shark into Sea world. THIS film, is the real sequel which concludes to the second and first, but it still isn't great. Lorraine Gary reprises her role as Ellen Brody, also Michael Brody (the kid from 1 and 2) comes back, along with his brother Sean (you might remeber Sean as being a cute little boy in the first film), well if you liked him in the first one you will be dissapointed 'cause he hardly lasts ten minutes in this one, although it is quite a thrilling scene. What was stupid about this film was that the rest of the family go to the bahamas 'cause Michael has a job there, but for some reason, the shark can somehow know where they're going and follows them there. I'm no expert on sharks, but I know they can't swim in warm water. Also, how can a shark have feelings. It heads there so he can kill the whole family. What I liked about this film was Michael Caine's performance, he shone some light into the movie. I didn't like the look of the shark (they usually look bad in all of the films, but this one looked horrible). I liked the cast, they seemed like they enjoyed doing this film, that little girl's quite cute too. What I hated was Ellen's flashbacks, she has flashbacks in this about Sean being eaten by the shark and Roy Schieder killing the shark from the first film... but how can you have a flashback of something when you didn't even see it? I liked a couple of shark scenes, I thought the chase in the sunken ship was quite tense. I didn't like the ending though. Like from the third film, the shark roars. Why? And it dies by getting the mast of the boat stabbed through it's body. Very sad.

Back when the original Jaws came out in the late 70's it scared the hell out of most people, myself included. Then came Jaws 2. An above average sequel that at least didn't insult us too much. Then came Jaws 3-D. The acting was at least good in the film but the movie itself was a little hard to swallow. This movie makes Jaws 3 look like a Kurosawa film.
  The plot is about the wife of Martin Brody played by Lorrane Gray, going to the Carribian after her son is killed by a shark, man this group can't get a break from great whites. She vists her other son the oldest played by Lance Guest. While down there another shark shows up, were supposed to asume its the same one and now it's out for revenge on the family.

1079689,1,6305814694,"First off, I must be honest: I get a kick out of these plastic-sharkfests (which I admit sounds a little suggestive), and there was a time when I thought this movie was actually as scary as its predecessors. But that was when I was ten years old, just after it had been first released.  Since that time, I've grown to have just a little bit more seasoned moviegoing tastes...and while now and then I may watch 'Jaws 2' for a few meager shivers or even 'Jaws 3-D' for a laugh, this one defies belief even for a 'Jaws' movie.  Somewhere along the line, Universal execs must have figured 'Jaws 3-D' turned out so ludicrously that they said to themselves, 'We'll go ahead with another one, and we'll just go back to Amity Island and be as straightlaced about it as possible...' which probably impressed the execs, until somebody said, 'only THIS time let's try to make it so that the audience will think that one shark after another can keep going after the same group of people and not be ridiculous!'  And that must have really tickled their inept fancy, because they managed to crap this turd out.
To start with, the film's very premise is even more absurd than that of 'Jaws 3-D', which at least was hackneyed enough for anyone watching that one to crack up. Instead of a giant shark breaking into an underwater theme park, this time we have a giant shark who somehow seems to have some mysterious psychic link with Ellen Brody (played once again by Lorraine Gary, who I'm guessing felt she was typecast by this point and just went with it, or did it as a favor to her then-CEO husband at the studio, I can't say).  It's bad enough poor Sean Brody bites it (or rather, the other way around) in the first five minutes after being established as an Amity police officer like his pop; even worse when director Joseph Sargent decides to get masochistic and remind us that Roy Scheider won't be coming back to save anyone from this mess: apparently the Chief died of a heart attack some years prior to the film's events, and a photo of him in the police office only serves to aggravate the agony of what is to follow.
And what DOES follow is an idiotic attempt to make the viewer believe:
1) That a great white shark would actually target a specific bloodline.
2) That said shark would be so bent on eating everyone in that bloodline that it will actively pursue them all the way to the Bahamas and stay there until the job is done - despite the fact that the water is just too damn warm for a real shark to tolerate that long.
3) That said shark can not only launch itself completely out of the water (which nowadays isn't all that silly a notion if you've seen any of these 'Air Jaws' documentaries on the Discovery Channel), but can stay there suspended for several minutes (Look! it's Matrix Shark!).
4) That the shark's intended victim will actually have psychic premonitions that it's coming to get them.
5) That a boat twice as big as the Orca (Quint's boat from the first film) could actually be sunk by the weight of a shark stuck on its bowsprit (yeah, yeah, I know they blew the shark up in the original ending. Perhaps Sargent felt that having a fourth shark die the same way was a little tiresome...but then what else CAN you do to get rid of a shark that big?)
6) And that Michael Caine actually starred in this piece of garbage. That's one for six.
And in terms of casting, everything's just wrong.  Again, studio-head's-wife Lorraine Gary was probably wanting a few extra bucks, but Academy-Award-winner Michael Caine should have known better (Roy Scheider DID, which could be good or bad depending on your point of view). Mario Van Peebles' career was just beginning, so he can be afforded at least one disaster; but Mike Brody this time is portrayed by Lance Guest - yeah, the same Lance Guest who lived out every sci-fi geek's dream in 'The Last Starfighter'.  Cheesy as that movie was, this was a horrific downgrade for Mr. Guest.  What's worse, the actress playing his wife in this one seems utterly frigid and despondent, except when she's in her shop making metal sculptures, sooty and dirty with blowtorch in hand (which again is a little suggestive, there).  Everything about 'Jaws 3-D' was goofy, to be sure, but even Bess Armstrong's character is sorely missed this time around.
In the end, though, the failure and cinematic abomination that is 'Jaws: The Revenge' finally put a franchise that had no right to be a franchise out to pasture, so some good did come of this film.  But if I were you, I'd steer well clear of this dungheap of a sequel.

First of all, hardly anybody gets eaten. After Jaws gobbles up the youngest Brody son Mom goes on a holiday to get away from Amity Island and it's history...to the Bahamas! Total change of scenery huh? Jaws follows. How? Don't ask me. And he gets there in a day when it would take any ordinary shark about a week minimum.

Her elder son works as a marine biologist (surely being attacked by sharks in the first two movies would put him off going in the ocean) and is studying sea snails (presumably he got fired from Sea World after Jaws 3). By pure coincidence (or contrivance), Jaws shows up and pokes his nose into the sea snail research.

The shark looks sooooooooooooo fake. It's very obviously nothing but foam rubber with plastic teeth. And it's incredibly stupid. The shark in the first film (and in the surprisingly good second) seemed to be kind of smart and cunning. But now it's just a big lumbering idiot.

Why on earth Michael Caine agreed to be in this is beyond me. He even couldn't get to the Oscars to accept his award for Hannah and her Sisters because he was too busy filming this turkey. And the story with him dating Mom Brody takes up a tremendous amount of the film's running time and ends up turning it into a soap opera.

The worst thing tho, isn't the elder Brody son's beard or Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent. It's the ending. Let me explain what happens...

Jaws stands on his tail!
On the Water!!
Roars like a Lion!!!
Is stabbed by the broken mast of a ship...
...and explodes!!!!

Of course!

Where on earth the idea for that ending came from is probably best kept a mystery. The fact that it recycles footage from the first film into this ending is a mockery of the original's genius. It should also be noted that this version includes the happy (alternate) ending in Mario Van Peebles survives being chomped across the belly by the big fish.

This new DVD release by Universal improves upon the shoddy, OOP Goodtimes release. Gone is the snapper cover, now we have a sturdy keepcase.

But it does have some great character drama, and in its unedited, extended version, is actually quite watchable. However, this version remains relegated to once-in-a-blue-moon TV showings and has never been released on video.
Universal did go through the trouble of including deleted scenes and featurettes on their DVD releases of the first two Jaws films. (Well, with the first one their only trouble was cramming everything from the five-disc laserdisc set of 1995 onto one DVD, which they didn't even succeed at, hence the LD has more stuff.) But their DVD releases of the last-two are strictly by-the-numbers, almost as bad as Warner Bros. pan-and-scan releases of their back library. The fact is that I know there are extra scenes from this movie that are sometimes shown out of place during screenings on Universal-owned TV networks. There is also, of course, a completely different theatrical ending not involving any exploding sharks or footage from the first film. But for the purposes of this Universal DVD, they have no knowledge of these scenes.
Overall, this is very disappointing. The studio seems to admit that no one really liked this movie by not putting anything extra on it, when we all know there is a wealth of material waiting to be released to the public in a watchable format. Shame on Universal.",1055894400,4,1621,4.813620071684587
1079768,1,6305814694,"Words cannot express my sheer dissapointment with this release (the now 3rd edition of ""Jaws: The Revenge"" on DVD!). First of all, ""Revenge"" is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination (it's only merrit being that it is part of the Jaws series and a treat for ""big-rubber-shark-lovers"" throughout the world). My problem with this new disk (the Universal release) is the following: In the original theatrical release of ""Revenge"", the shark dies when Ellen Brody stears the front of the boat into the side of the shark and impales it with the broken mast. The shark writhes in pain as blood oozes from its mouth. Slowly, the giant shark sinks back into the water, taking the front half of the boat with it. The closing shot of the scene is a beautiful underwater shot of the sinking beast falling into the darkness below with the front end of the ship stuck in his belly.
The scene is bloody, violent, and an absolute thrill to watch.
But then Universal had to ruin it...
When ""Revenge"" was originally released on video, the ending was changed completely. Now, instead of the front of the ship stabbing the shark and sending him sinking to its death, the front of the ship hits the shark, and he/she/it BLOWS UP FOR NO APPARENT REASON. To achieve this new ending, Universal splices in clips of the shark death from the original ""Jaws"", and uses an embarrissingly crude model to illustrate the shark blowing up (in fact, if you watch the scene frame-by-frame, you can visibly see a small, poorly sculpted wooden shark next to a poorly crafted wooden boat being blown up in what looks like a puddle in somebody's driveway).
Not only does the scene not make any logical sense and looks terrible, Universal then decides to cut in shots of Mario Van Peebles' character ""miraculously"" rising to the surface, having lost 10-15 gallons of blood after being bitten in half by a 3 ton Great White Shark (needless to say, he dies in the theatrical cut).
It has been this poor excuse of a cut of the film that we have lived with since 1988. Several years ago, ""Goodtimes, a one-time distributor of ""Revenge"", released the film on DVD (2 versions, one in a snap-case, the other in a hard-case). While these discs contained the ""bogus"" ending, the transfer is quite good and the image quality is superior to other ""nobody-cares-about-this movie-but-me"" releases.
But for a short time, there was hope...
Last month, Universal announced its own release of ""Revenge"" on DVD (along with the first DVD of ""Jaws 3""). It would appear that FINALLY, after years of insulting its viewers' intelligence, Universal would finally release the theatrical cut on DVD. I mean, what would be the point in releasing a title in the same version that's been around for 4 years? Why sell fans something they probably already have? Why not give them something different?
The answer to this is that obviously Universal couldn't care less!
Not only does the new disk contain the ""bogus"" ending, but it also contains a transfer that is inferior to the one produced by Goodtimes.
I had such high hopes for this release. Needless to say, I am an enormous Jaws fan. In fact, while on a field-trip to Universal in 1986-7, I actually saw the shooting of this final scene on the backlot - stabbed shark and all!) I feel VERY CHEATED by this release, and now hold zero hope of the theatrical cut ever making it to a DVD player in the future. This was Universal's chance to make good on 16 years of [crud], and they blew it.
Avoid this disk at all costs.",1054684800,9,3515,4.643659711075442
1079812,5,6305814694,"Joseph Sargent's truly great ""Jaws The Revenge"" is a film whose time has not yet come. To mock its awfulness is to miss its masterful use of sharks and women. Beginning with a great scene in which a shark eats a man, it ironically moves onto a scene with no sharks at all. The juxtaposition is profound and, most of all, surprising, allowing us to note the absence of both man (now eaten) and shark (swimming with a belly full of man). My favourite sequences are when we get point-of-view shots from the shark's perspective - I felt transported and realised this is as close as I'll ever get to knowing what it's like to be a shark. Such is the power of cinema, brilliantly unleashed to its full and utter potential in ""Jaws The Revenge"" (no colon necessary). A masterpiece of masterful movie magic.",1054598400,8,799,4.517241379310345
1079813,4,6305814694,"Ok, so maybe Jaws The Revenge isn't cinema at its finest.  But, the amount of criticism levied to this film is ridiculous.  I am admittedly a huge Jaws fan and have watched the original movie over 40 times.  I have seen Jaws The Revenge possibly 25 times.  I know that it isn't a classic by any means, but the movie really is good.
First off the acting.  It wasn't terrible.  Lorraine Gary did a terrific job as the lead.  I felt sympathy for her and she does have some ability.  Lance Guest as Michael was fantastic also.  I am still waiting for him to get his break out role in Hollywood because I think he has potential.  Mario Van Peebles brings some Bahamian humor, and it sheds some light onto the movie.  And Michael Caine maybe isn't at his finest, but he is decent enough.
The cinematography is just beautiful.  It just makes me want to go to the Bahamas every time I watch.  The music score is better than the original.  It has a sort of mystical, on the edge feel to it.  It's too bad Michael Small didn't get any recognition for it, and anyone would be hard pressed to find the soundtrack, even though it's one of the finest ever.
Joseph Sargent does an okay job directing.  I admit that it isn't anything special, but it's not trash.  A lot of people have problems with the special effects and some of the things the shark does.  Yes, the shark looks fake.  That's a given when the film has such a low budget and the studio behind the picture isn't totally committed.  There is one scene in particular that many have a problem with and that is when the shark is doing a so called stand on the water.  It's obvious to me that the scene is in slow motion, and the shark is leaping from the water, which makes it appear to be standing on its fin.  There are many aspects of the film also that are very authentic.  An example is when the shark is attacking the boat and it's eyes roll back in its head, which is what a real great white would do.
The ending is terrible and totally brings down the film.  But once again, I come with my defense.  In Michael De Guzman's original script, the ending was much different and rather exciting.  As I alluded to earlier, budget constraints kept this film from producing an adequate ending.  If you are interested, there are many links on the Net with the original script.
Jaws the Revenge is a movie that I guess you have be a really big Jaws fan to enjoy.  I know that it isn't perfect by any means and that it never will be considered to be a good movie by anybody other than the ""Jaws Junkies.""  But, for all the people that like to tear it apart and dissect its every mistake, remember that it's only a movie and not real life.  4 Stars",1046563200,,2690,4.258893280632411

1079819,1,6305814694,"""Jaws - The Revenge"" is just plain and simple a bad movie.
Lorrain Gary and Michael Cain are actors I respect and admire for their work on other films, and that is why it is so hard for me to find a logical reason why either one of them would participate in this mess of a sequel. One can only hope that they simply had too much faith in the director and honestly believed that he would make a good movie. And even then, the script would have sent most serious actors on the run.
First of all the plot is unbelieveably poorly conceived. Even if you accept the concept of a shark having a vendetta against a particular family, the story is so full of holes and illogical twists that you end up sitting in front of the sceen in utter disbelief: Ellen Brody has flasbacks to incidents where she wasn't present?! The pilot Hoagy actually chrashes his plain into the ocean to rescue Ellen (this is laugh-out-loud-funny if you actually consider how ridicules it is), and subsequently survives being trapped inside the plane while the shark is attacking him, then swims to the boat in prestine condition?!
Jake somehow survives being dragged into the ocean, lodged between the shark's teeth, with massive bite wounds and blood loss?! What?...it just let him go? Oh, I forget, the REAL target is still Ellen Brody, who feels she has to sacrifice herself in order to stop the killings. The shark then tries to kill her by leaping unto the boat (much as in the original JAWS) but not until it has managed to stand still in the water raised on its tail long enough for Ellen to ram into it, with so much speed that it actually BLOWS up.
Need I say more? But it doesn't end here. The plot is completely horrendous. Then the least you could hope for is that the action scenes were somewhat well executed. But no, not even that is the director able to pull off. First of all the shark looks entirely fake, making it impossible to have proper footage of it, rendering many of the scenes ineffective. On top of that the scenes are so poorly constructed that no suspense or real ""action"" is gained from them. The camera angles are flat and unfocused, the editing is illogical and robs the sequences of any natural narrative flow.
In the end you have to be a really, really, REALLY big JAWS fan to enjoy this film, and even then I find it hard to justify actually liking it. The original was a masterpiece of action and suspense, the second one was pretty good, the third was a bit embarassing - but this last chapter (so far) of the JAWS saga is so bad I think most people just want to forget it ever happened.",1033689600,5,2593,4.4154488517745305

The title sequence has some eerily impressive camera-work, and the younger Brody brother's death scene is dramatic.  But after that, the whole thing descends into soppy, thrill-less slush.  The storyline is a total nonsense.

Michael ""I'll appear in any old twaddle for a few readies"" Caine hams it up like there's no tomorrow, characters seem to die and then magically return from the dead and the ending makes no sense whatsoever.

The result is a series of admittedly scary but otherwise thoroughly pedestrian shock sequences, topped off by flashbacks experienced by Gary to events that she never even witnessed (!!) and a climax that is both totally unbelievable and rather disgusting.
JAWS 4 does boast a good music score by Michael Small, and is directed well enough by Joseph Sargent, a journeyman director who has made at least two great films prior to this--1970's COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, and 1974's THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE.

Sheriff Deputy Sean Brody (son of the late Sheriff Martin Brody, is killed off when Roy Scheider wisely refused to be in this outing) is killed in the waters off of Amity Island. His distraught mother Ellen Brody (well played by Lorraine Gary) believes that the attack was personally motivated by revenge for the shark that Martin killed in 1975 (readers should note that this movie ignores Jaws 2 and 3-D). Her surviving son Mike (an icthyologist studying sea snails in Bermuda) fears for her mental state and encourages her to join his family for awhile down in the tropics, far away from Amity. Ellen goes and the shark follows for this it is indeed personal.
What hampers Jaws the Revenge, aside from a silly story, is that director Joseph Sargent (The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, Colussus: The Forbin Project) does absolutely nothing with the supernatural concepts or the shark. The attacks scenes are perfunctory in nature, only a sequence where the demon fish chases Michael through the bowels of a sunken ship comes close to generating any kind of suspense, and the mechanical gear operating the shark is painfully visible in several shots.

Jaws 3 was just too much. Originally, that movie was not even supposed to be a Jaws movie, but dialog was edited and cut to make it a Jaws movie. And a very poor one at that. Unfortunately they didn't learn. This movie is not as bad as 3, but that really isn't saying much.
Quite a shame, really...the characters in the movie are actually quite likable.  Character development is actually handled rather well, and Michael Caine also manages to liven up the movie a bit with some tales to make you chuckle.  But it's the overall plot of the movie that makes it so bad.  If this wasn't a Jaws movie, it may actually have been a good movie all together.  The concept of a shark out of revenge.......sorry...that just really makes no sense whatsoever.  Mike Brody is back after a family tragedy, and his mother (role reprised by Lorraine Gary) is convinced that its 'The Shark' and its back for revenge.  You will also see some of the original cast of Jaws reprising their roles alongside Ellen Brody, such as Mrs. Kintner and police deputy(Still a deputy after all these years???).
Mario Van Peebles is Mike's research buddy and adds comic relief to the film. There is a rather poigniant moment that is a throwback to the original Jaws, with Mike and his daughter acting out the same scene that Chief Brody and Sean did at the dinner table in the original classic with the copycat game. Other than that, this movie is full of action, but there are many things that just go beyond the realm of nonsense and stupidity, namely the shark with a mind for vengeance.
What is very odd is that there are several versions of this movie. When you see this movie on TBS or TNT (At least once a month on a sunday afternoon, you WILL see it), Jake(Mario Van Peebles) will either be alive or dead at the end of the movie, and the then end scene will be either the theatrical movie ending, or a badly cut and pasted scene from the ending of the first movie. Very odd. Randomly on TV they change it. This particular edition of the movie features the 'new' footage, with Jake actually being alive at the end. All in all, a bad movie mainly because it has taken the Jaws series WAY too far. IT should have stopped at Jaws 2. Even Jaws 2 was slightly overkill. Let a good name rest. If you want a mindless action movie with a poor plot, then go for this. Personally, I recommend the same thing i did for Jaws 3:
If you are lounging in bed and feeling lazy on a Sunday afternoon, and you happen upon this movie on TBS or TNT(Like I said, at least once every month or so), by all means watch it.

As for the film itself, it's dismal. Not much of substance happens - the shark appears at the beginning (although it's too dark to see), and at the end, but the middle of the film is essentially a lengthy soap opera with lots of false scares that aren't scary. The climax, incorporating footage from the original 'Jaws' (something that will make you gag - 'Jaws' was and is a classic film, whereas this is dreck), is confusing and unexciting - Michael Caine repeatedly presses a button on a radio transmitter, and that's it. It gets a little kudos for being a proper sequel to the first couple of Jaws films - 'Jaws 3D' was, apart from having a shark in it, unrelated - but it's neither bad enough to be funny or interesting enough to watch.

Michael Caine is wasted as carefree pilot Hoagie, in whom Ellen takes a romantic interest. Film does have a slick look and great scenery in the Bahamas, but the shark doesn't look real and is about as frightening as a rubber duckie. Michael Caine declined to appear in person to accept his Academy Award for ""Hannah and her Sisters"" because of this movie. That move alone might have killed the career of a lesser actor. Kind of neat how he emerged from a sinking airplane with his clothes fully dry.",983491200,,1204,4.552995391705069
1079960,1,6305814694,"The Jaws franchise would never recover from this sequel. If you ask me, I don't believe that a Jaws sequel should always have to include a member of the Brody family.  I feel the same way about Sigorney Weaver in the 'Alien' series.  It doesn't add any freshness or a sense of originality if you just continue to use the same human characters again and again and again, because lets face it, the shark is the real star in the movie.  I say we give it some fresh meat and pitch the leftovers!  This series has the potential to do so much better than this, and it's a travesty to see what it has become.
On the other hand, perhaps it's for the best.  The jaws series did nothing but demonzie sharks, especially Great Whites, and have placed them, in various areas around the globe, on the endangered species list.  I'm not saying that the Jaws movies were directly responsible for this. Lots are killed due to sloppy fishing methods, that target anything and everything in the ocean.  But I sure would like it if the next Jaws movie didn't spout so much nonsense about sharks.  I mean, have you watched the trailers.  Some of the lines describing the Great Whites are ludicrous!  ""A mindless eating machine, that will attack and devour anything!""  Followed by that line about God creating the devil, and giving him JAWS!""  Marine biologists probably go nuts hearing crap like that, and any kind of animal lover probably would too.  Just because they aren't cute and cuddley doesn't mean they should lose their right to live.  And I would hate to imagine a world where those majestic predators no longer roam the ocean depths.  At the very least, the jaws movies should have a message before the movie telling viewers that it is completley unrealistic, and that sharks do not behave in the manners they potray them.
If Universal does attempt to resurrect the Jaws franchise, they should try to make the shark a little more believable, and I'm not just talking about its appearance.  And loose the Brody family as well.  Start fresh, and get rid of that 70's attitude about sharks.",982713600,,2077,4.615803814713897
1079961,2,6305814694,"Jaws was fantastic. Jaws 2 was good. Jaws 3 was halfway decent. Jaws 4 is poor, trying to recapture the best elements from the first two films, failing utterly. While there are a few good scenes, the movie on whole is not worth watching except for some rainy Saturday afternoon.
Lorraine Gary is good as Ellen Brody, and Lance Guest is decent though he can't live up to Dennis Quaid, but the great Michael Caine is wasted in the frivolous supporting role of carefree pilot Hoagie. The story is ridiculous and filled with plot holes. This is the real sequel to the first two films, it finds Martin Brody dead from a heart attack and Ellen living with Sean back in Amity. However, another (and even larger!) great white shark attacks and kills him in the bay at night. Ellen is visited by Michael and travels with him to the Bahmas. The shark has follows them and is determined to kill off the the Brody family!
Sargent's direction is poor, though the cinematography succeeds and the music score is haunting. Sargent (unsuccessfully) relies on fast editing and blood to create tension, since there certainly isn't any written into the script. The film makes good use of the Bahamian locations, but everyone knows a shark would not be in the Bahamas, the water is far too warm. The only scary scene is the underwater chase in the sunken wreckage. The bay attack scene is poor due to sloppy editing, its also very disgusting. This marginal movie is really sunk by the stupid, abrupt finale. It is completely ridiculous and filled with flashbacks she never witnessed. After the banana boat attack you really expected a little more time, instead Ellen just jumps on the boat and she's off! Also, Jake would have definitley died, the shark's jaws would have bitten him in have. The shark looks fake as usual but isn't bad overall.
Overall, Jaws 4 could have been better but is really sunk by the finale. Aside the plot it isn't bad to watch for a good laugh.",977616000,3,1951,4.6253602305475505

1079963,1,6305814694,"Jaws 4 is the absolute lowest film I've ever seen....  The idea that a shark ""family"" could be trying to destroy the Brody family was first introduced in Jaws 2, when the shark specialist answers to Brody ""sharks don't take things personally"".  Sigh.  How wrong she was.  In Jaws 3, a third shark wreaks havoc on SeaWorld, where, SUPRISE!, the Brody boys are working.  So, actually, Jaws The Revenge (4) ties up the ending of the series, ruling out the coincidence explanation.  Indeed, as if the plot weren't weak enough, the movie quality sucks too.  The film follows old hag Ellen Brody, who now lives quietly at Amity, and seems perfectly happy seeing how she's lived through three predecessing shark attacks (one would think she'd have gone insane, but this only shows in her hair).  When Sean, the younger of the two Brody boys, now a cop, is killed while retrieving a log, Ellen's fear of another shark is confirmed, and the woman won't shut up about it.  So, to escape the pain, she moves in with her other son Mike, who lives in the Bahamas, and who is now SUPRISE!, an ocean biologist.  Living with him is his young daughter and wife, both of whom you want to die from the first time you see them.  From there, things really go to hell, leading Ellen, her son, Ellen's boyfriend, and Mike's politically correct fellow biologist, in a final confrontation with the shark. ... sharks don't roar, they don't seek revenge, they don't jump out of the water for 10 seconds at a time, and finally, they don't blow up when someone rams them with a pole.  As if this weren't bad enough, there are only 2 deaths in this movie, a shark so mechanical-looking, you can almost hear the gears grinding, and a ludicrous chase scene in which the shark stalks Mike through a sunken ship.  The shark becomes less a hungry animal, and more a determined killer.  This movie simply ruined the other three, and slobers all over itself before overwhelming us with the utter stupidity that haunts the writers of this flounder.  Steer clear, even if you're a devoted fan of the series, this fourth installment will haunt you forever, and ruin the great fun that the original sparked.",970358400,,2166,4.633507853403142

1080012,3,6305814694,"It's a Jaws movie; not Braveheart, not Silence of the Lambs, but a JAWS MOVIE.  Universal Studios' theme parks (both coasts) have extremely cheesy attractions based on this series (Orlando's version seems closer to  ""Jaws 2"" than the original), and no matter how silly, people  stand in line for an hour to see the big, fake-looking shark jump out at  them.  I live in Orlando, so I see this first hand every time I visit the  park.
Subsequently, I just bought ""Jaws - The Revenge"" on DVD  (cheaply) just for fun.  It was the first time, since it's opening night in  1987, that I have watched it (13 years ago, I walked out of it before the  end and sneaked into ""Robocop"" which opened the same day).  Now  that I've seen the whole thing, I feel humbled.  It's really not that  bad.
I have actually read all of the reviews here at Amazon, and some  others (Roger Ebert's Chicago Sun-Times review and TV Guide Online's Move  Database - an excellent resource) and I am ready to debunk those who had  (ironically the same) jaded opinions.  Let's begin, shall we?
""The  shark looks fake"" - well DUUUUUHHHHHHH!  This was made 12 years  before ""Deep Blue Sea"" and two years before James Cameron helped  break special effects ground with ""The Abyss.""  Yes, it looks  fake, but for the first time in the series, the shark occupied a lot more  screen time.  Spielberg didn't show the shark early in his film because he  really couldn't - the mechanical sharks made for the first ""Jaws""  were very difficult in the beginning of the shoot - there's still one  missing out at sea from 1975.  Also, CGI was almost unheard of at that  time.  I'm sure if the filmmakers had the technology at the time, they  would have tried to utilize some of it.
""The story has continuity  problems"" - actually, it doesn't.  There are two scenes where Ellen  Brody (played for the third time by Lorraine Gary) has flashbacks to events  where she wasn't present; one was from the first film (and justified later  in the story) and the other was from several key points in this film.  The  only other way to convey these thoughts/flashbacks would be to say them out  loud - guess how awkward that would've been.
""The shark roars""  - OK, it did, but it was only for dramatic effect (the shark in the Orlando  ride roars, too - listen in the boathouse).  Remember, we're not defining  Pi here.
""The shark leaps out of the water like Shamu and stays  there indefinitely"" - well, no; the scene in question is in extreme  slow motion and probably should've been edited a little better.
Roger  Ebert stated there was no ""establishing shot"" before the shark  was killed, and it did happen pretty quickly, but if you put yourself in  the same situation (I know, now I'm supporting the realistic quality of  it), you don't exactly get a lot of ""establishing shots"" in life  to perfectly set up a climax.
Please understand, I do realize this isn't  a fantastic movie, but the bad reputation that it has, and the fact that a  ""part five"" hasn't occurred in over a decade and probably never  will, is unfortunate.  Given the advancement in special effects technology,  maybe someone will write a worthy script and another will be made (maybe on  the 30th anniversary of the first film).  Jamie Lee Curtis came back to  Haddonfield 20 years later, so I guess anything's possible.
By the way,  the DVD version is the one where Jake (Mario Van Peebles - did you know his  father Melvin was in the movie, too?) lives.  I saw that question a lot  here, so I thought I should probably mention it.  The DVD has absolutely no  extras, which some may scoff at, but hey, I said I got it cheaply.

7895316,3,6305814694,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Joseph Sargent, Jaws: The Revenge (aka Jaws 4) chronicles events when widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) vacations in the Bahamas where her son, Michael (Lance Guest), lives and works. Meanwhile, a huge killing machine in the ocean has its eyes set on her & family. Mario Van Peebles plays Michaels associate while Karen Young plays his wife. Michael Caine appears as a small plane pilot who seems to be interested in Ellen.

Theres been a critical feeding frenzy over this movie for decades, no pun intended. But its really a decent nature-runs-amok creature feature laden by dubious filmmaking at the climax. Theres a nice build-up and the material is taken seriously by the quality cast. Ellens developing relationship with the amicable pilot is kinda heartwarming and both Guest & Van Peebles are effective male protagonists. Moreover, the switch to the Bahamas keeps things fresh after the first three movies.

Of course, the idea that a vengeful great white shark follows the Brody family to the Bahamas is absurd, but weve all heard of dogs or cats following a family hundreds of miles. This is just an imaginative stretch and we find Michael seriously wondering if that ridiculous premise could be true when just such a creature shows up. So the dramatic build-up is effective, not great, but certainly effective. Unfortunately, theres almost zero female eye candy despite the resort setting and, like I said, the climatic scenes are awkwardly done. Its like the creators really needed to reshoot some scenes and add others, but they lacked the funds so they tried to force the footage they had to work in the editing room.

The four Jaws movies detract in quality chronologically, but The Revenge is still worthwhile if you enjoyed the first three, just disregard the closing sequences. Beyond that glaring weakness, its not even close to being as bad as people criticize.

7895323,5,6305814694,"If you ever desired to see a shark roar like a T-Rex than Jaws the Revenge is the movie for you! I still can't fathom why Micheal Caine was in this movie besides he wanted an easy paycheck and a vacation in the Bahamas. This movie is so bad its good, I recommend at least a six pack of IPA to enjoy it to the fullest. BTW, sharks do not roar.",1506643200,,342,3.8309859154929575
