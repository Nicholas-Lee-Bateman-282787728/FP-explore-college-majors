1666009,5,B00005UMQK,"My sister recomended these DVDs to me a few months ago.  She has four kids currently-all in the space of just under six years.  When I saw her last, she had lost SIXTY pounds just doing these DVDs a couple of times a week.  I just had my second child, and after a dibilitating car accident, well needless to say, I need to loose a lot of weight.  So I decided to try these DVDs.  I have had them a little over a week and have done both the one mile and the two mile-infact I just finished the two mile a few minutes ago.  They are great!  They are very low impact-I have bad knees from the car accident, and a plate in my left arm, also from the accident, and I can do the two mile without any pain in my knees, and I can do push ups which I haven't done in almost four years!  They are fun and easy, and I can tell already that I am loosing weight.  It only takes a half hour to do the two mile, which I can still do with two kids.  I also like this because I am so much overweight, I can do this in the comfort of my own living room, without the uncomfortable stares of other people at the gym or the track.  Also, you can move around up and back, side to side, but you don't have to.  It is very flexable.  Currently I am living in a hotel room in MS while my husband is in Air Force training, and I can do it easily in my 12x9 hotel room.  I highly recomend this to anyone who will listen ... So buy and enjoy!",1058832000,147,1414,3.831034482758621
1666010,5,B00005UMQK,"Well, I admit it, I'm a couch-potato and proud of it ... until two weeks ago, I was changing my clothes and my 4-year-old niece walked in the room (looked at my stomach), and asked ""does it hurt?""  Well, that's all folks, I ordered Walk the Walk.  I LOVE IT!  Leslie is inspiring and funny.  The most important part is that YOU CAN DO IT.  I mean she understands that we're just beginning.  She doesn't expect us to learn the routine by watching for one minute and then plunge right in like an experts.  She explains every move.  Although I've only been doing it for a few days now I am hooked.",1047513600,11,594,4.241071428571429
1666011,2,B00005UMQK,"This 3-DVD set includes:
- Miracle Mile DVD
- 2-Mile Walk
- 4-Mile Weight Loss Walk
If you are a veteran of the Walk Away The Pounds walking program, you will have no problem completing these walking workouts. It is a do-able supplement to the Walk Away workouts, for days when you don't want to use weights and need a little more variety. These DVDs do not have any strength training, and uses very little in the way of arm movements. They are purely cardio workouts.
However, there are a few things that really date these DVDs. Be aware that they are a re-released old workout from 1992. The music is very dated. Leslie is also continually referring to using a VCR with the workout: ""Fast forward to the cool down"" or ""if you didn't catch this step, rewind and do it again."" The clothes and hair styles also really date this DVD, from the ""big sock"" look to the layered leotards.
The moves themselves are more complicated than her Walk Away workouts. For example, she has you doing several variations on side steps - lots and lots of 80's style grapevines, stepping to the corners at an angle, and even backwards side steps.
The bonus features on all of the DVDs include a short biography of Leslie (non-interactive), and a URL link to Current Video (the manufacturer). For example, The 2-mile DVD features a three-minute introduction, where the walkers themselves are interviewed about the walking workouts and their success with them. Leslie then introduces the walkers (the same walkers as the ""Miracle Mile"" DVD). What I really appreciate about Leslie's choice of walkers is that they are ""real"" people. One of the walkers lost over 100 pounds!
While I really appreciate Leslie's Walk Away Workouts, I find this release to still need some tweaking (how about a make over?). I only use it occassionally, to throw some variety into my workouts. If you're bored, and looking for something else to try with Leslie, give this a go.",1043193600,255,1932,4.718934911242603

There is absolutely no challenge to any of them, once you have mastered the basic moves.  Leslie means well and has done a great job in getting people to lose weight, but after working out with three or four of her DVD's, there's no point in buying any others.",1417305600,,419,4.4868421052631575

1666028,5,B00005UMQK,"I love Leslie's DVDs and have many. Use them nearly every day. This item contains 3 DVDs: 1 mile, 2 mile and some sort of other exercise thing. This is classic old-school aerobics...kinda like a ""Flashdance"" era thing. Don't let THAT deter you!  I just did the 2 mile and it was GREAT....as good or even BETTER than some of the new ones.
Great switch-em-up cross training. Man, I'm soaking wet!  Anyway, this one has my Seal of Approval...at least the 2 mile DVD session does!",1407801600,,476,4.523255813953488

walking dvd's. I will admit that I do like her newer walking dvd's alot better because they are more improved and harder. I recommend any walking dvd that Leslie Sansone makes. They are easy enough for a beginner and if you can't get to a gym you can use these every day and still see results.",1399161600,,416,4.2125

1666035,5,B00005UMQK,"The ""Miracle Mile"" was my favorite for so long, then couldn't use it on my VCR as we switched to DVD.  Good to have it back again!  I like the pace of these work-outs, and gives me the exercise I need at a level that doesn't hurt my knees.  It says ""John"" is posting but I am his wife!",1386806400,2,285,3.7966101694915255

1666037,2,B00005UMQK,I love the walk away the pounds series.  This set of DVD's were re-packaged.  By the look of them it was clearly from the late 80's or early 90's but the date on the cover says 2004.  Do not buy this!,1377648000,,200,3.8292682926829267
1666038,5,B00005UMQK,I like this dvd a lot. The fact that it is broken down into 3 parts is great for me. I am still mostly using the Miracle Mile but will be moving on to other parts soon.,1367798400,,168,3.5675675675675675

1666040,5,B00005UMQK,"I've been doing the Walk Away The Pounds series for a several months now and thought I would try the Walk The Walk series.  It's properly referred to on the box as ""Walk Aerobics"" because it's a bit faster paced but don't let that intimidate you!  It still has the same basic moves but you can do a ""grapevine"" instead of double side steps to really get the heart pumping if you'd like.  The Miracle Mile is great because it has a quick 10 minute segment targeting the upper body, abs and legs.  The Two Mile Walk is fast paced and it really is amazing how quickly the time goes by!  She does do some steps where she moves around quite a bit that I haven't mastered yet but I just do them in place instead and it's still a fantastic workout.  I haven't worked my way up to the Weight Loss Walk of 4 miles but am looking forward to it.  :)  I have many of Leslie's videos and love them all!",1349395200,7,889,4.098265895953757
1666041,4,B00005UMQK,"These DVD's are older, 90's I think, but they are still good ones. I like the variety.  Start out with the 15 minute Miracle Mile, then work your way up from there. There is also a short 5 minute toning ( to get you started ) segment on the Miracle Mile DVD. The 2 mile walk is a brisk one; it moves fairly fast. Leslie uses some different steps that she doesn't use in her current DVD's. The 4 mile DVD is shot in a ""house""..a little less professional, but I like it.  The segments are broken down into 1 and 1.5 miles so you can stop if needed,then go to the cool-down. This is a set to work with from beginning to end. You would have to supplement with more toning.  The only shortfall ( the reason for 4 stars ) is Leslie doesn't offer many pointers on form; such as holding your abs firm, squaring your shoulders, don't hold your breath.  These are helpful to beginners, and a good reminder to others, as well.",1292976000,,915,4.181818181818182
1666042,4,B00005UMQK,"Like many other women, I still mourn the loss of Denise Austin from Lifetime and - in my fairly humble opinion - Leslie will always be 2nd best, mainly because Austin's shows gave you a different daily background & also because I loved Denise's giggly cheer & radiant smile. (I always thought Austin was like those rare, terribly pretty girls at school who couldn't help being adorable even to the losers!).
Now I'm a (critical) fan of Leslie Sansone, but I do feel her early VHS tapes are hard to beat. (I've worn out 3 of them!).
This DVD set is good value but the warm up is oddly chaotic, with a really irritating little bit of nonsense at the start (with class members doing a rather theatrical skip on to the set before taking their places.)
The 2 mile is good - although Leslie's ghastly outfit is distracting and, when I started the sets, I noticed some of her cues are off - so I kept stumbling.
The good news is that she's such a pro, this set will works its magic. She knows her stuff and you'll soon see the promised improvement.

1666045,2,B00005UMQK,"I am a really big fan of Leslie's but I am disappointed with this workout.  I already have the 1&2 mile workouts which are good if you have limited time to spare to exercise but it seemed good value as a package.  I did not like the 4 mile weight loss walk at all some of the moves are a but complicated, the music is boring the set is boring and oldfashioned not that bothers me as long as I get a good workout.  Leslie talks constantly she misses steps and looks to me like she is acting.  I am sorry I really do rate Leslie but if I were you I would definitely leave this one alone.",1212451200,,585,3.9322033898305087

1666051,5,B00005UMQK,"I liked the Leslie Sansone DVD. A person can begin with the mile walk and on to the two mile then 4 mile. It is a great way to begin exercising again.

To my surprise, this is 1980 version. It's ok, but I am a bit taken back by the dated look. The workout is still pretty good though. It was quite funny to see all of the old looks...a bit distracting but funny. She talked a lit less back then which is a good thing.",1187395200,4,413,3.9285714285714284

1666057,1,B00005UMQK,This was clearly recorded in the early 80's when she was trying to refine her style and figure out what worked and what didn't.  The studio/design elements were horrible.  The camera shots were very amateur.  I didn't like how it went from Mile 1 to Mile 2 to Mile 3 with obvious breaks in between.  It is terrible!  I had Walk Away the Pound on VHS and was looking to upgrade to DVD.  I figured I would buy it on Amazon and save myself some money.  In the end it was a waste of money because I had to go to Leslie Sansone's website to order a more recent workout program and boy was it worth it.,1178928000,3,596,4.042735042735043
1666058,3,B00005UMQK,"I used to watch the walk show on demand tv and it was pretty good, but this dvd kind of disappointed me because it looks like old. No one in 2007 wants to exercise with a dvd from the 90's so I really hated that part.

Other than that it's pretty good. The exercise is low impact, but it works, if you make the 3 miles you will notice some pain in your muscles at the next day. The third mile is definitely KILLER, oh gosh! was hard to finish that one.",1178409600,2,452,3.9130434782608696

1666077,5,B00005UMQK,"I recently started the miracle mile and the two mile walk and I must say that these 2 workouts are FANTASTIC!!!  I have not tried the 4 mile walk as of yet because I am still working up to it.  I can tell you that the miracle mile is a fast paced walk that is done in 15 mins.  Then Leslie takes you through some conditioning exercises such as crunches and squats.  They are very low impact and just right for me as I have a bad back. I loved the miracle mile so much I did it 2 times in a row.

The 2 mile walk is also fantastic.  It is also a low impact 2 mile walk which touches almost every muscle in your body.  The next day my body was aching from muscle pain, but a good muscle pain.  I absolutely loved doing both walks, the time flew by and I was not bored at all!!!  Keep in mind that Leslie takes you through a thorough warm up and cool down for both walks.

I am looking foward to the 4 mile walk which I will try on the weekend.

I also have the 3 mile walk ""super fat burning"" dvd.  I love this dvd to.  The super fat burning walk leaves you soaking wet from sweat.  There could be a bit more stretching at the end but still the workout is FANTASTIC!!!",1156291200,20,1166,3.885593220338983
1666078,5,B00005UMQK,"I love this product.  It has an 80's style, but don't let that fool you.  It is a wonderful workout and has so much versatility.  You can work with time constraints and stop each tape after 1 mile, 2 miles, etc.  You can also do the whole thing if you have time.  It is great for my busy life.",1155859200,6,293,3.8983050847457625
1666079,1,B00005UMQK,"Walk the Walk is not walking at all as much as it is dancing  and unless you are able to and like to do dance steps, I strongly recommend that you DO NOT purchase these DVDs.  I previously had the VHS ""Walk Away the Pounds"" set of tapes for 1, 2 and 3 miles and because of an accident  needed to replace them.  I have osteo and rheumatoid arthritis and walking with those tapes was something I could do using my walker.  I couldn't keep up with the new ""Walk the Walk"" pace and found myself getting angry and frustrated with this  program. I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this product.",1150761600,12,599,4.256637168141593
1666080,5,B00005UMQK,"Exercise has never been my favorite thing to do, but I do want to improve my health and fitness level.  This DVD has been great for me, easy to do so I won't get discouraged and stop using it, and I can feel the results in my muscle tone after just a couple weeks.  I plan to keep it up!",1143244800,10,287,3.7666666666666666
1666081,5,B00005UMQK,I like the fact that there are 3 DVD's.  It is a great workout!  Not alot of music which is nice!,1143158400,6,97,3.5714285714285716
1666082,4,B00005UMQK,These DVDs are very good. They are low impact but you know they are working because you feel it the next day.  The music is ok but the techniques are good.,1142812800,8,155,4.0
1666083,4,B00005UMQK,"The workouts are very good, but as a previous reviewer stated-it is very 90's. I wish that I would have known that before I bought it. All in all, you will get a great workout!",1142553600,3,176,4.057142857142857
1666084,5,B00005UMQK,"I am new to the Leslie Sansone program, but even after only a couple of months, I'm hooked.  Her workouts are easy to fit into my schedule and they are a lot of fun.  More importantly, they are not too difficult, but still give a good workout.  I'm 50 something, and it is important to me to keep moving and these DVDs do the trick.",1142380800,7,332,4.076923076923077
1666085,4,B00005UMQK,"This workout works the entire body.  It's especially good because it doesn't take long for the workout, but you've burned a good amount of calories.",1142208000,5,148,4.92
1666086,5,B00005UMQK,"I first saw Leslie Sansone Walk the Walk (Miracle Mile) on my On-Demand cable and it only lasted a month. After doing it for 6 days a week for one month, I lost 8 pounds. I decided that I would buy this DVD and really get going! I really love the DVD set and I am doing great. I know that one of the reviews said it was outdated, but what do I care. I am more concern about an exercise program that will get me in shape and help motivate me to continue. Anyway, I remember wearing those high tops and socks, I thought I looked good!!",1141948800,12,533,3.9444444444444446
1666087,5,B00005UMQK,I love her workouts. They are quick and fun to do and are doable everyday. I highly recommend these workouts.,1140912000,2,109,4.5
1666088,5,B00005UMQK,"I have been so pleased with these videos.  I have been desperately looking for a workout video that doesn't hurt my knees.  This is it!!  It's fun, easy without a lot of unrealistic moves for a large person. There are a lot of options you can use with these to increase the intensity and duration as you progress.  My favorite is the 2 mile. I recommend this highly!",1140393600,7,366,4.338235294117647
1666089,5,B00005UMQK,"This video is the best that I have tried.  It gives you three options - the miracle mile if you only have 15 minutes, the two mile (30 minutes), and the weight loss which is 60 minutes long.  When you have finished walking to any of these videos you really feel like you have done a good workout.  I think these videos give you a better workout than walking on a treadmill or around your neighborhood.  With the leg lifts, squats etc., which are incorporated in the walk workout, you can really feel it in your legs, thighs and butt after you are finished and the next day, which tells me that I am going to see some results fast.  I have recommeded this video to all my friends and I think these are the best videos that Leslie Sansone has made yet.  Well worth the money!!!!!",1137715200,29,777,4.2517006802721085
1666090,5,B00005UMQK,"I just did the 2 mile video from this set and it is truly great!! I had the regular 3 mile video, but this one has me really sweating.  It also adds variety since it is different from the Walk Away the Pounds sets.  I love it, now I have no excuse not to workout.

The routine is simple to follow, yet it gives you a great cardio workout.  My heart rate was really good throughout the video.  The kicks, grapevines, knee lifts, side steps and just plain walking did the trick.  A truly good 30 min workout.

I hope to see lots of results soon!!",1134691200,15,544,4.0754716981132075
1666091,5,B00005UMQK,"I am just beginning to to exercise after many years of being sedentary. These programs are challenging, yet fun, and they can be expanded as I get better, so I will save money in the long run. Leslie Sansone is an upbeat, and positive intructor. These programs are definate keepers!",1127952000,14,282,4.66
1666092,5,B00005UMQK,"I have been a fan of Leslie Sansone for a few years now and own quite a few of here videos but this one is a hidden gem.

  Sure, it may be ""dated"" but that's way at the bottom of my priority list.  What is important is that:

  It gets the job done proper.

  It adds variety to my growing collection of fitness dvds

  It's low impact so I can do this workout without knee pain.

  It's fun to do.

  I had read reviews in the past about how many of her fans love this ""2 mile walk"" even more that some of her newer offerings and now I know why.

  I just finished the workout and got a good sweat from this one and I wish I had gotten this a long time ago.

  By the way, I consider myself a ""recycled beginner"" but can push myself to intermediate on good days.",1123718400,39,764,3.8366013071895426
1666093,4,B00005UMQK,"I first walked the two and then three mile walk with Leslie at my Wellness Center and loved it.  She is extremely easy to follow and you really get a great workout.  I had been on the treadmill and cross trainer and when I tried the walk with Leslie I found muscles that were not getting worked out!  You will work up a sweat and you will feel great afterwards.  I loved it so much I just ordered the Walk the Walk 3 DVD set so that I could do it at home when I can't make it by the Wellness Center.  I'm like most of the others, it doesn't bother me that the tapes are dated.  It is the work out that counts!",1109635200,15,609,3.870967741935484
1666094,5,B00005UMQK,"The Walk series are absolutely fantastic!  I've been a walker for many years, going about 4 miles a day three to four times a week plus.  This is great when the weather is bad and the treadmill gets way too boring.  Leslie keeps you motivated and makes the workout fun!  I also have asthma and have no problems doing this workout, where I have difficulty with any aerobic type routines!  Great if you're just starting out or if you exercise regularly!",1077062400,17,451,4.518518518518518
