3100242,5,B0012YN2IA,"I saw this film when it opened the Milwaukee International Film Festival, where it won the Audience Choice Award. The large diverse crowd laughed and cried with the family and young protagonist as he did his best to avoid the obstacles and dangers around him as he walked to the pharmacy for his grandma. Every parent knows the dilemma of when to ""let go"" and of how much responsibility to give at what age. This universal dilemma is complicated for working class families living in somewhat marginal neighborhoods. Despite the packaging as a ""black film,"" this is a movie every parent will relate to and every kid from elementary age up will enjoy. There are few movies these days that a whole family can watch together, few that feel as authentic as this one. If you enjoyed Stand By Me, Raising Victor Vargas or Soul Food, you'll love Gettin' Grown.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raising-Victor-Vargas/dp/B00008EY7D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raising Victor Vargas</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-By-Me-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXIP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand By Me (Special Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soul-Food/dp/B00000ILED/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soul Food</a>",1205280000,2,1316,6.933734939759036

8248311,4,B0012YN2IA,"OK...I am bias.  The lead, Isaiah was one of my students.  I thought for a ""first time"" movie it was an excellent effort.  I have shown the movie to my 8th grade studnets and they got a lot out of it.  They could relate to having to make choices and how they can effect you.",1230681600,4,274,3.9272727272727272

8248314,5,B0012YN2IA,"This lovely jewel of a movie provides a heartwarming and thought provoking view of the difficulties of raising a child in an inner city environment. The characters are both believable and memorable and the movie avoids typical gang and drug shock value. Writer/Director Aaron Greer tenderly follows his main character Eric as he learns to make the decisions needed to Get Grown. Although this is a gentle family oriented movie, it never becames sacchrine or Disneyesque. I highly recommend it for it's authenticity and it's uniqueness.",1205280000,6,535,5.232558139534884
