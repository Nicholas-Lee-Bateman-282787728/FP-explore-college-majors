5495042,5,B00ARVRCHQ,"""There is not enough forgiveness in the Universe.... for all I've done.""

Let's face it: the first three Subspecies films are utter and complete schlock. Bear with me! I love these films as much as you probably do. I was delighted to see these released on Blu-Ray! While they ARE pretty cheesy, at least as far as production values go, there's something strangely compelling about this tale of unrequited love. You cannot help but feel a little sorry for Radu, a Nosferatu-type vampire who is intentionally as hideous as possible in comparison to his beautiful half-brother, Stefan. Of course Stefan gets the girl and everyone thinks Stefan is just the greatest, he is filled with goodness and all that crap which is totally the opposite of what a great vampire is all about. And Radu is like, ""Yeah, no...... I AM taking your castle, your girl and of course your holy rock that drips the blood of all the saints and which bestows upon the owner all kinds of power."" Touche' Stefan!

Radu is unapologetically vicious, he kills his father in the first scene of the first movie, and makes plain his intention to kill his half-brother ASAP, just because he thinks Stefan is a little too fastidious. [Which he sort of is.] Meanwhile there are these three little hotties ""researching"" folk-tales at the local Ancient Fortress(tm), two of whom are pretty ditzy and the third is Michelle, our heroine. Michelle appears in all three films, and the actress playing her changes in the second movie - I cant decide if this was for the better, or not. Both Michelles are quite good. After at first pursuing her just to get under Stefan's skin, Radu develops an intense fixation on her, and Michelle spends a lot of time trying to escape this walking nightmare who is single-mindedly intent upon owning her. I will say, Radu knows zilch about the modern female mind - which is understandable, he lives in the backwaters of Romania - and the thing he wants most is for Michelle to submit willingly to his dominion. If she will not submit willingly, he will force her. She is his possession. Or so he thinks.

One of the main strengths of this series is that it was actually filmed in Romania, and is scored by the same soundtrack through the first three films, which adds a sense of continuity. Romania looks like a place where fairy tales still might happen, and not necessarily good ones either. Perfect!

With better production values, Radu would be much more of a horror than he already is. Due to the powers of the Bloodstone, from which he incessantly drinks, Radu literally cannot be killed - and if anyone tries he has physical abilities best compared to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"": each part of him is separately alive. Ugh! Not to mention he continually drools blood, or in the later films a shiny black liquid. Just disgusting. But underneath he really does love Michelle. He does show her a few kindnesses as things progress. Through the three films we find out more about this vampire family and its branches, and its a pretty ugly family tree to say the least.

Radu is not some glittery lover-boy, he is not kind, he is not beautiful or suave or a snappy dresser [he likes it classic, like all the great vampires do], he is not a violin virtuoso, he does not go to high-school eternally or make girls swoon across the cafeteria or hang out at the local pick-up joint looking for victims: he is literally the walking dead, cold as graveyard clay and maybe even an actual alien underneath that black coat - and he does not really care who knows it. There's nothing pretty about him or his condition. His bloodline does not even seem to originate from human stock. But like all the rest of us, he craves love - even if he has no idea how to go about getting it. He's LONELY. That's what keeps me coming back to these films again and again, because there is something almost Shakespearian about his struggles to win the woman he loves. And with her struggle to overcome the horror and disgust she feels upon the mere sight of him.

And with her disgust at what she herself has become.

Somehow these four Subspecies films, along with their ""Vampire Journals"" spinoff, are more than the sum of their parts. Production values increase as the series moves along, but that's not really the reason. The first film especially should be a cinematic joke. But its not, and for that my hat is off to Full Moon for overcoming the limitations of their genre. They were cranking out cheap little monster films for short-term profits - and then they came up with this lightning in a bottle. That's a rare gift indeed.",1397001600,3,4603,4.626682986536108
5495043,5,B00ARVRCHQ,"While I may be utterly fed up with the current direction of Full Moon Productions, I will say that they were responsible for making some of the finest horror films of the 1990s. Among their best work was this trilogy of vampire films. I won't bother reviewing each movie individually, suffice it to say that they just keep getting better with every viewing. The acting is fabulous, especially for a DTV series, particularly Anders Hove as Radu. Watch for the subtle nuances of his performances in the second and third films. The way he speaks to his mother, obedient yet desperate to defy. Every hesitation and gesture is a window into a remarkably complex character, one you have no problem hating but might sympathize with if you take the time to think about it. The ever-changing dynamic between Radu and Michelle is brilliantly achieved, written with continuity and development in mind and performed with grace.

What is best about these films is the remastering work done for these BD releases. Each film looks a million times better, with deep contrast and vibrant colors allowing the viewer to fully engage with the material instead of squinting at blurs and wondering why the sets look so bright. The first movie shows, in my opinion, the most improvement as it no longer looks like it was filmed on a cheap video camera in a poorly lit studio. The remastering of each film into widescreen (16:9) is fantastic and only adds to the viewing pleasure of the audience. They look like the high quality films we always knew were hidden inside the old VHS-dull copies we once owned. My only hope is that they give the same treatment to ""Vampire Journals"" which is my personal favorite in this series. (ADDENDUM: They did finally release an HD version of Vampire Journals and it is sublime!)",1391731200,4,1791,4.77741935483871
5495044,4,B00ARVRCHQ,i have seen this 3 part movie since 1996 and i have to say i found it intertaining back them i love it even more today . i love shopping with amazon they have the fastest service i have seen thank you.,1389052800,,201,3.8095238095238093
5495045,4,B00ARVRCHQ,"In an age of sparkly vampires, Radu, is a great classic throwback to vampires gone by. Nosferatu like yet very Hammer Films in feel.",1388102400,,132,4.541666666666667
5495046,5,B00ARVRCHQ,"I cant remember when I saw these flicks , but I was young.....Im in my 30s now so Im guessing 15-20 years ago. I was a big fan of Full Moon back in the day, and I remember watching these on VHS, and laserdisc. While browsing through horror flicks I came across this Blu Ray pack for 11 bucks here on Amazon, and figured why not?

First off I forgot how much I liked these movies (especially parts 2, and 3). All parts of the series are a  continuing story of a vampire named Radu. Mostly filmed in Europe, it definitely has an authentic, old school horror vibe to it. These are low budget in many ways, as most Full Moon movies were. So I cant say these movies would be for every moive/horror fan. If you liked Puppet Master, Demonic Toys etc, and are a Full Moon fan... this ones for you!

Considering how old they are the Blu Ray remaster is really good in my opinion. They are also presented in widescreen mode to fill your flat screen perfectly. The sound is also 5.1 surround , excluding part 1 which is only standard stereo. So overall you're getting a really great hi-def version of these old school Full Moon classics for a steal of a price. The only knock on the set....well theres 4 movies in the series. Part 4 is available for under 5 dollars on DVD, but really cant see why the blu ray wasn't in this set.",1383091200,,1318,4.222222222222222
5495047,4,B00ARVRCHQ,Great trilogy box set...except its FOUR films. Why Subspecies 4 is not part of this box set is inexplicable. There isn't a 5th film or even a 6th film. The series is over or stalled at 4. So why not release it as the Subspecies collection with the fourth film? Weird.,1370736000,2,267,4.254901960784314

5495049,3,B00ARVRCHQ,"Ah, vampire B-movie schlock. Not big blockbusters starring Anne Rice vamps or Stephenie Meyer sparklepires, but lower-budget affairs splattered with blood.

One of the best examples of the genre is ""Subspecies,"" a movie series with a genuinely creepy villain and lots of atmosphere. ""Subspecies: The Awakening / Bloodstone: Subspecies II / Bloodlust: Subspecies III"" brings together the first three volumes of the series, following the vampire Radu's pursuit of a pretty but utterly useless American girl.

""Subspecies: The Awakening"" (I don't know why it's called that instead of just ""Subspecies"") involves three grad students writing their theses in a Romanian village. Their investigations bring them to a ruined castle where vampires were once said to dwell, as well as an encounter with the broodingly handsome Stefan (Michael Watson). Guess what Stefan is!

But it turns out there is still vampiric stuff afoot: the evil, ghoulish Radu (Anders Hove) has returned to the castle, and has murdered his own dad to steal the Bloodstone (which supposedly drips the blood of saints). And he's decided to make all three girls his consorts -- meaning that only Stefan and an elderly Romanian man can save the day!

In ""Subspecies II: Bloodstone,"" Radu is returned to life and immediately kills his brother, only for Michelle (Denise Duff) to immediately escape with the Bloodstone. Her sister Becky (Melanie Shatner) arrives in Romania to try to help her sister, but she has little idea that Michelle has become one of the undead -- and that Radu is determined to find her.

And in ""Subspecies III: Bloodlust,"" Radu's ""mummy"" returns him to live with Michelle's blood. The three of them immediately teleport back to the Transylvanian castle, where Radu begins educating Michelle in the ways of the vampire -- and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Becky arranges a small-scale infiltration of Radu's castle, so she can rescue her sister.

""Subspecies"" is a pretty cheesy piece of work -- lots of naked boobs, goopy blood and hilarious death scenes (head-stab!) permeate the series. And the main character is a vampire who looks like a ghoul and has fingers he can snap off to form little stop-motion demons that... well, they occasionally fetch things for him. Like I said, cheesy.

However, it's a fun kind of cheesy. It's the kind of cheesy that you want to get popcorn for, rather than scoffing at -- and it's definitely more hardcore than ""Twilight."" Some parts (the middles of ""Bloodstone"" and ""Bloodlust"") are rather slow-moving, but we also get charming Romanian villages, picturesquely decayed castles and plenty of vampire attacks.

The characters, however, are a mixed bag. Anders Hove is a deliciously disgusting villain, with his stringy fingers, ghoulish face and drooling mouth. But he also manages to inject some pathos into Radu in ""Bloodlust,"" where we see the vampire starting to grow sad. And Becky Shatner does a really good as a strong, independent heroine who just wants to rescue her sister.

Sadly, Denise Duff's Michelle does little other than cry, scamper around whining, and hang around Bucharest clubs in increasing gothic clothing. You'll get tired of her fast; the character is much better when played by Laura Tate. Stefan is possibly the wimpiest vampire in existence (he's immobilized by a NET), and ""Mummy"" may actually be a mummy that someone dug up and put on puppet strings.

""Subspecies: The Awakening / Bloodstone: Subspecies II / Bloodlust: Subspecies III"" brings together the first three -- and three best -- Subspecies movies. Watch these, and avoid the fourth one.",1361577600,5,3605,5.115646258503402

Attractive in an undead kind of way?  You bet.  Ah, those foolish victims, thinking they could thwart old Radu and/or his gorgeous mom.  Well, you can't blame them for trying I guess, but old Radu's been around the block a time or two and he's a hard guy to pin down, though they keep trying.  I'd just say this - if you haven't seen these fine movies - well, son (or daughter) you are way behind.  Do yourself a big ol favor and buy this set and give it a watch and tell everyone Izray recommended them.  Pleasant dreams.",1424304000,,685,4.384
8557094,4,B00ARVRCHQ,"The early and mid-1990s were filled with many nights spent lounging on my couch ingesting as many horror and sci-fi films as I could. When I ran out of mainstream and theatrical movies to watch, my appetite was quickly quenched by any straight-to-video genre entry I could get my hands on. Full Moon Features were at the top of my list when entering Blockbuster or Movie Gallery. You couldn't go wrong with Puppetmaster, Mandroid, Trancers, or any other number of low-budget B-quality titles Charles Bands production house was putting out back then. My favorite entries of Full Moons roster are now available in a special high-definition set entitled Subspecies: The Blu-ray Collection Volume 1.

The first three movies in the franchise are included in Subspecies: The Blu-ray Collection Volume 1. The first entry centers on three students studying the folklore of Transylvania who uncover more than they anticipated. They stumble upon a clan of vampires ruled by the monstrous Radu. The sadistic vampire becomes obsessed with making them his fledglings and pursues them relentlessly. Wielding the power of the Bloodstone, a relic that drips the blood of the saints, Radu and his subspecies - a pack of small, sinister creatures - give the girls a true understanding of the local mythology.

""Bloodstone, the second installment of the series, concentrates on Radu's fledgling and love interest, Michelle. She flees from his castle with the holy relic - the Bloodstone. Meanwhile, as a new vampire, Michelle struggles with her emerging bloodlust. To escape Radu, she hides in the basement of a theater in Bucharest, waiting for her sister to arrive from the US to help her - before it's too late.

""Bloodlust"" brings the third coming of Radu, who captures his fledgling, Michelle, and returns her to the castle he shares with his sorceress mother. Radu teaches Michelle how to master her vampire powers. Meanwhile, Michelle's sister, Becky, plans an armed assault on Radu's stronghold. She is determined to save her sister's soul - and this time she's brought some help.

Each movie in the Subspecies franchise gets better and better in quality. The stop-motion in the first film is relatively primitive even for the early 1990s. The little creatures that spring out of Radus blood go from looking like pieces of clay smashed on film cells to becoming more and more convincing in Parts One and Two. The practical effects are beautiful to gaze upon as the gore splashes and the body parts are dragged across the screen. What we get to witness here is classic independent horror filmmaking at its best.

One of the things that make the Subspecies movies so special to both the horror and the vampire genres is where the movies were shot. Instead of Hollywood stages and typical American locations, they were actually filmed in the land of the undead  Bucharest, Romania. How much more legitimate can you get than that?

The first Subspecies movie has a vampire for every type, whether you love Twilight or 30 Days of Night. Theres the attractive undead brother who is willing to spend eternity with the human he has come to love. We also get the detestable monster that resembles Count Orlock in the original Nosferatu movie from the 1920s. He has elongated razor-sharp fingers and a pale sunken-in face that you wouldnt want to encounter in a dark alley.

Each movie in Subspecies: The Blu-ray Collection Volume 1 is rated R or not rated. The original is the 20th Anniversary Edition and unrated. They all feature violence, gore, nudity, and profanity. If you're familiar with Charles Bands Full Moon films from the 1980s and 1990s, you know what extent of skin you can expect to see  a lot of boobs and butts.

Subspecies: The Blu-ray Collection Volume 1 includes bonus material for each movie. The original film features the first Subspecies VideoZone and six Full Moon trailers. The Bloodstone: Subspecies II Special Edition comes with Making Subspecies: The Recollections of Ted Nicolaou, Anders Hove, and Denice Duff, Audio Commentary by Ted Nicolaou, Anders Hove, and Denice Duff, a Killer Subspecies Montage, Original VideoZones and Full Moon Trailers. The Bloodlust: Subspecies III Special Edition features the same extras as Part II.

The big question on my mind is why Full Moon didn't go ahead and do special editions for the companion film The Vampire Journals and the last sequel, Bloodstorm: Subspecies IV, to make one complete Blu-ray set. With this set holding the Volume 1 title, its pretty obvious they plan on doing a second set with the final two. I look forward to it, but wouldve loved to have all the movies in one collection.

Make sure you set aside about five and a half hours when you sit down to put in the first disc of Subspecies: The Blu-ray Collection Volume 1. Once you get started, you won't want to stop. Each movie ends on a cliffhanger and flows seamlessly into the next entry. Ill always hold these movies in high regard as legitimate pieces of gothic horror entertainment.",1423440000,,5009,4.935866983372922
8557095,5,B00ARVRCHQ,"okay so I know this is  a Charles Band Production but  in my opinion, its the best one.  I have these in several versions and  I know this only includes the  first  3 movies in the series, but for some reason I like these. Great villain.  You loathe him and  feel sorry for him at the same time. Great fun B movie style.",1410739200,,320,3.9682539682539684
8557096,5,B00ARVRCHQ,"I was a bit skeptical about seeing these movies in widescreen presentation.  They were, after all, direct to video releases that came out during the age of VCR's, and thus, originally full screen presentations.  However, unlike other titles I've seen where studios simply cut the top and bottom of the picture away and then call it 'widescreen', Full Moon video actually went to the trouble or taking the original films and panning back slightly so that a true widescreen presentation could, in fact, be had.  This is absolutely outstanding!  I think even Radu would have to happy with this package.",1409788800,2,599,4.96
