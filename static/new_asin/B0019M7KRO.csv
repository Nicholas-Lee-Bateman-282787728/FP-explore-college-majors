8274602,5,B0019M7KRO,"I loved this movie despite its bad reviews. I enjoy science fiction because it presents a ""what if?"" scenario and that is exactly what this movie does. It asks the audience what might happen if a scientist discovered how to open a portal into a parallel universe and then had the portal close and trap him there? I happen to own a vast science fiction collection and there are few if any movies concerning parallel dimensions. In fact the television series ""Sliders"" is the only one that immediately comes to mind. The movie ""Webs"" opens with some electricians discovering a hidden room full of abandoned scientific equipment in the basement of a condemned building that when tampered with opens a portal into a parallel universe--more specifically a parallel city of Chicago. The parallel Chicago, however, is overrun with spider-like creatures controlled by a queen that have nearly destroyed all of the humans there and are now on the verge of destroying themselves because they have consumed nearly all of the food (the food being humans). This infestation of spider creatures all came about because when the scientist opened the original portal between the two dimensions 30 years ago a second parallel universe simultaneously opened allowing the spider-like beings to be transported into the parallel city of Chicago. Of course the scientist who invented the portal is still trapped there in the parallel city of Chicago and with the help of the electricians and his original notes  is able to reconstruct another portal. After destroying the spider queen who rules the parallel universe (thereby liberating the remaining humans in the parallel city of Chicago) the last two people who were part of their immediate group are able to transport themselves into another parallel universe. This new parallel universe is beautiful. It may or not be our Earth. But just when you think it's all over and the two survivors are making love on the beach another portal from another unknown dimension opens up and deposits more unknown creatures onto their beach. Oh my God! Then the movie ends. Remember that when the scientist opened the original portal 30 years ago that another portal simultaneously opened thereby allowing the spider queen into the parallel city of Chicago to wreck havoc on that city. Obviously the opening up of two parallel dimensions has happened once again and it made for a great set-up for a Webs 2 movie which, unfortunately, never happened. As one reviewer said, this was a good movie that could have been a great movie if they had only had more money to work with. I for one would certainly like to see a remake of this movie using modern CG effects and a budget large enough to ensure that the remake would become one of the all time great science fiction movie classics that the original ""Webs"" should have been.",1516320000,,2841,4.906444906444906

They find A room with strange machines in there,soon as one turns on the machine A light appears from some disc on the floor,and two men go into the light and end up in A parrellel world like theirs,but it not they willsoon find deadly dangers they never could of imagined where real. Like I said alright but the ending should of been different.",1373673600,,481,4.2967032967032965
8274606,3,B0019M7KRO,"AND THE PROBLEM WAS? Four electricians are transported to a parallel world while attempting to shut down an old project in a deserted building. This other world is filled with cannibalistic spider-humans, but on the up side we learn it has no tattoo parlors. Rather than deal with all the positive aspects of the world (no greasy bikers) they decide they need to destroy the spider queen and escape this world. The movie starts out with promise. The spider people have that ""zombie"" feel to them. This movie was not a career builder for any of the ""actors"" in it. Horror, violence. No nudity or F-bombs.",1278547200,4,603,4.69811320754717

8274608,3,B0019M7KRO,"Great start, good ideas...well directed...but how long can the quality
last...depending on the budget...  As the movie goes along, it stays
afloat but barely...  Why, cause its has the capability of becomming
a great movie, but due to lack of budget (in most cases) we end up with
a good movie...that could have been great.  Most of the acting is passable, and we also have a actor that the camera loves a lot and is
continously getting playgirl angles on his face....too bad...brought the
movie down a knotch, but overall love the portal effects...good acting
on the scientist part.
A watchable movie...may keep it",1243296000,7,615,4.894230769230769
