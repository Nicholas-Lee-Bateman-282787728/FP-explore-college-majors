6124197,5,B00GYCWKYC,"I have been using the Pitching Academy's system for the last several years now. It has been a great tool in teaching my son the correct mechanics of pitching. As a coach, the information in these DVDs has been invaluable in helping teach my team proper pitching  and hitting mechanics. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to take their game to the next level.",1385510400,,367,4.5606060606060606
6124198,5,B00GYCWKYC,This DVD Series is the awesome!! My son has used these and has become a fantastic pitcher!  The principles taught here are spot on to what every great pitcher needs to know!!!,1385510400,,175,4.46875
8628688,5,B00GYCWKYC,I worked with Dan as I was trying to pitch at the college level. I would work with Dan every summer to get my mechanics fine tuned and ready for the next year (I would also go to him during the year every once in a while when I got out of sync). He helped me be at the top of my game. He helped me understand what things I did well and what I needed to improve. I would recommend him to anybody that wanted to improve their game and mechanics and protect their arm. I only wish that the season started right after the summer and I didn't have to wait for the spring. This DVD series gives a great guide to coaches and players.,1392422400,,626,3.937007874015748
8628689,5,B00GYCWKYC,"Every Little League, PONY League, Babe Ruth League, Cal Ripkin League and any other league, should make this DVD set mandatory for all coaches to watch.  The explanations are spot on, as are the skills Nate and Dan are teaching.  I discovered The Pitching Academy on Youtube, to help my players throw a curve ball.  I wanted something they could watch, after I explained it to them.  95% of all curve ball 'teaching' have the player, curl their wrist and/or snap their wrist, which can be detrimental to pitchers arms.  Dan taught it, the way I learned it and taught it, but sometimes the players need to see it and hear it from a different source. The amount of times I heard coaches shout, ""Squash the bug"" and they players squashed the bug, but everything else was wrong.  And the coaches couldn't see it.  Or more bad advise about how to throw harder.  Get the DVD!!!!!!",1386806400,,874,4.5576923076923075
8628690,5,B00GYCWKYC,"This DVD series is a must own for any developing pitcher. Whether you're the coach or the student, YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS SERIES! My sons pitching has improved leaps and bounds from the knowledge and instructions found in this series. From mechanics to exercises/workouts and everything in between; its all here. A great investment for certain, I would recommend it to anyone.",1386460800,,380,5.0476190476190474
8628691,5,B00GYCWKYC,My son was about 11 when he began taking pitching lessons from Dan at the Pitching Academy. While he had a good arm he lacked consistency. It took one lesson for Dan to teach him the mechanics that helped him have a successful high school pitching career. Dan's approach was simple and made sense from a physical standpoint.  These DVDs helped us to stay on track and served as an excellent way to reinforce the skills learned at private workouts with Dan.  I recommend this DVD series to anyone interested in developing there physical and mental approach to playing baseball.,1386028800,,576,4.75
8628692,5,B00GYCWKYC,"I have been teaching younger pitchers and after studying The Pitching Academy's 4-disc Series, I have been able to work better with my kids.  Nate and Dan's emphasis on the mental aspects of pitching along with their injury prevention advice complement the mechanical side of teaching young pitchers very well.  I'd say this series is a must for Youth baseball coaches and any parent who wants to see his own child grow in pitching.",1385942400,,432,4.824324324324325
8628693,5,B00GYCWKYC,"After searching all over the Internet and locally in my area I could not find the right baseball training that was easy to understand and cost effective for me as a parent. I was looking for something that I could do at home with my son without the high cost of individual lessons. Then I found The Pitching Academy DVD series. I was a little skeptical of buying yet another DVD series online but after digging into their site I could tell this DVD series was different. I am glad I made this purchase! This DVD series is great! Dan and Nate do a fantastic job of breaking down the complexities of pitching and hitting mechanics in such a way that a parent or player can easily understand them and duplicate them. Nate and Dan teach mechanics by showing you what MLB players are doing so you can be confident in applying what you learn. This DVD series has not only helped my son but helped me become a better teacher of baseball. I help coach a 12U travel team and it is my go to DVD when teaching pitching and hitting to our players. What also makes this DVD series different from others is that the content goes beyond the DVDs. Nate and Dan provide email updates on hitting and pitching topics that keep you informed and provide yet another way to help your son increase his baseball IQ (and yours). Nate and Dan do not simply sell you a DVD and then forget about you. They love to hear from parents and players and have always been there to respond to any questions I have had. I feel that I have built a relationship with Nate and Dan and the benefits go well beyond the DVD series. The internet is a great thing but the amount of incorrect information that you can find is overwhelming. Do yourself and your son a favor, purchase this DVD series and sign-up for communications from the Pitching Academy. You will not regret it!",1385942400,,1834,4.381231671554252
8628694,5,B00GYCWKYC,"Whether you're looking for a complete approach to pitching and hitting, or just some answers to ""How to.."" this inexpensive program is the best. Nate and Dan have put together this comprehensive, instructional program on hitting and pitching the correct way, the way the successful pros do it. That is the big difference here, since a plethora of instructional videos on the market are demonstrating so many incorrect mechanics and methods. Those methods can hinder success at the plate or even damage a young pitcher's arm.
 The Pitching Academy viewpoint of doing things the way the MLB players do it accounts for the success of this Series.. They are easy to follow and fun to put into practice. Plus, Nate and Dan will answer any questions you might have. They're good guys who care about helping players get to the top of their game.",1385596800,,838,4.819444444444445
8628695,5,B00GYCWKYC,"Dan and Nate have been instrumental in helping my sons improve in many aspects of the game of baseball.  This DVD series can be used to view and re-view.  It teaches basics that even younger kids can understand.  My oldest son worked with Dan on his pitching mechanics and helped him become a D1 baseball pitcher.  My 2nd oldest son has worked with Dan also and currently is a starting pitcher on his High School team.

Nate's ability to simplify hitting drills and explain technique helped both my sons raise their batting average.  Dan and Nate combine their talents on this DVD series that makes it a sure ""hit"" for anyone interested in improving their baseball game.",1385510400,,670,4.683760683760684
8628696,5,B00GYCWKYC,"If you are a parent and are looking to help your child strengthen their confidence on the mound, you've got to buy this DVD series! Dan's experience coupled with his ability to teach clearly will be a benefit to anyone looking to take their pitching to the next level. Thank you Pitching Academy!",1385510400,,296,4.60377358490566
8628697,5,B00GYCWKYC,"I have been very impressed with Nate and Dan, the guys giving the instruction in these videos.  They have a great interest in helping young players to reach their potential.

These products have been very helpful in helping me to help my sons learn correct mechanics.  Both of my sons ended the last season wishing there were still more games because of the progress they were making.  We saw immediate increases in velocity and control with the pitching tips. Both boys also enter the batter box with a ton more confidence with the batting helps.

I have done a lot of research and have been 100% confident that the information these guys give is in line with the best research currently available and is backed up by the examples of the best in the game.  I would strongly recommend this serious to anyone who wants to give their player more velocity, control, and most of all, confidence.",1385510400,,891,4.643312101910828
