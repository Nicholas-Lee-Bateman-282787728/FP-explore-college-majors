8339480,5,B001S86JIK,"We found Rick Steve's Spain and Portugal both entertaining and informative.  The DVD consists of seven episodes shot between 2000 and 2009.  Five episodes focus on regions in Spain and two on regions in Portugal.  It's too early to tell how up-to-date and accurate the material is because we haven't gone yet.  Also, the material is not comprehensive.  It lacks the details and current information you would find in a good, recently published guide book (tipping, maps, phone numbers of restaurants, hotels, etc).  We definitely plan to supplement the DVD with a guide book, which we can carry with us for reference.  Still, a picture is worth a 1,000 words, and we felt that Rick Steve's Spain and Portugal was well worth the time and money invested.  It's a good way to start your dreaming!",1254700800,9,792,4.814814814814815
