8016393,5,B0001US5TW,I have small kids who adore Hello Kitty.  These stories are so well done and just fun to watch.  They hold their interest and my husband and I are actually entertained by them also.  Lots of fun!,1357257600,,195,4.216216216216216
8016394,3,B0001US5TW,"Hello Kitty & Friends: Fairy Tale Fantasy is the first volume of DVDs released for Hello Kitty & Friends.  This disc features two stories starring Hello Kitty (""Cinderella"" and ""Snow White""), one story featuring Pekkle (""The Adventures of Sinbad""), and one story featuring Keroppi (""Robin Hood"").

When my 3-year-old daughter watched this DVD with me, she was definitely the most interested in the two Hello Kitty stories.  She also seemed to like the Keroppi story, but didn't have much interest in the Pekkle story.  Even with her lack of interest in the Pekkle story, I believe the cute animation style and the music help to make these stories more accessible to the young audience that the DVD is targeting.  As an adult, I found the episodes to be enjoyable, and that the writing for the English dub was done in such a way that it wasn't talking down to the kids.

Admittedly, this is a rather ""low frills"" DVD.  The only ""special feature"" is the DVD credits.  Normally, I would count the lack of special features as a mark against the DVD.  However, since this is being aimed at and marketed to young children, special features aren't quite as important, since young children don't have the attention span to sit still for special features.

These Hello Kitty DVDs contain anime that's very friendly to young children, although girls will probably be more interested than boys.  If you have a young child at home and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would recommend the Hello Kitty & Friends DVDs.",1223337600,5,1513,4.803088803088803
8016395,4,B0001US5TW,"The cartoons on this DVD are from a series that I refer to as the ""Sanrio Animation Series.""  The star characters in this series are Hello Kitty, Keroppi, and Pekkle.  They are primarily english-dubbed versions of the Japanese Sanrio cartoons.  As an adult collector of Sanrio, I enjoyed watching these cartoons, but because of their Japanese origins, be aware that the cartoons might not be suitable for very young children (but they are no worse than anything that Disney has to offer).  (If you are looking for completely mild/non-violent videos for your children, I suggest the Furry Tale Theater or the educational Hello Kitty Paradise series instead.)

This ""Fairy Tale Fantasy"" DVD contains: Cinderella (Hello Kitty), Snow White (Hello Kitty), Robin Hood (Keroppi) and Sinbad (Pekkle).",1119484800,26,792,5.253968253968254
