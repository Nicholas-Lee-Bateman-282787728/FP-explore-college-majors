7935834,2,B00005AUEI,XPW Go funk yourself was a little bit good. I'm a big fan of wrestling since i was six years old. It cound have been better. That is the reason i give it 2 stars out of 5 Stars. The match that i liked the most was for the king of the deathmatch title. It was the champ Supreme vs.( the challenger) The Messiah. This guys are harcores wrestlers to the Xtreme. It was the first time that i saw that type of title match. I know that title comes from Japan. It was great that they brought it to the US.The other match that i like just a little bit less was for the XPW World Heavyweight Title match.(The champ) Sabu vs.harcore legend Terry Funk(challenger).It was to short but it was not too bad. It's not the match they did at ECW Born to be wired 97. It was a brutal match to the extreme. I consider you to not buy this tape. Just ask somebody to lent it to you or tape you the king of the deatmatch title match.,1010016000,,910,4.0054945054945055
7935835,1,B00005AUEI,"XPW isn't a wrestling company, it's just an excuse for Rob Black to show off his porno industry to wrestling fans.  Every woman in this company is a certified whore, the wrestlers miss more spots than a broken Hoover vacuum, and the announcers should be jailed for being so awful.  They're so bad, I'd rather listen to Eric Geller and Jon Watanabe in the old FMW videos!  ARGH!  Don't waste your money!  If you want good wrestling, get any ECW, new FMW, or ACW video!",1009324800,,467,4.447058823529412
7935836,3,B00005AUEI,"I watched this tape expecting something really amazing and totally hardcore, like when ECW first made it to the mainstream. But really, I was disappointed. I'll admit, some of the matches are good, but mostly the tape lacked in what I was looking for. Its good if you're trying to get into XPW, but if you're expecting something like FMW or IWA, don't look here.",1000944000,,362,4.584615384615384
7935837,5,B00005AUEI,"In this awesome tape of XPW Go Funk Yourself you will see an amazing show. Kid Kaos vs. Steve Rizzono in an ""I Quit"" Match, also Kid Kaos takes on Tracy Smothers in a ""Loser Leaves Town"" Match. You will see what some say is the greatest match in XPW today, the Deathmatch between Supreme and The Messiah, this match will blow you away. And the Main Event is Sabu defending the XPW Title against Terry Funk in an all out war, awesome match. So this tape is a must if your a hardcore wrestling fan.",999820800,,496,4.177083333333333
7935838,5,B00005AUEI,"XPW, eXtreme Pro Wrestling, and they've certainly got that right. OK, so the first few matches are nothing special, and havin a pirate sword is a bit unbelievable, but if you are a hardcore fan, you've got to see Messiah Vs Supreme - King of the Deathmatch. XPW, these are going to be massive, the new ECW is here. In the XPW vs ECW war, this is certainly a point for the west-coasters. KEEP IT EXTREME!!",999475200,,404,4.328947368421052
7935839,1,B00005AUEI,"I've seen some XPW on the web after I ordered this, but before I got it, and I must say, after watching this, I am sorely disappointed.  Watching this really made me realize how silly ""hardcore"" wrestling really is.  When ECW did it a few years ago, it was fresh and new and outrageous, and nothing that the general US wrestling-viewers had seen.
Now, it's just stupid.  Pro wrestling is supposed to suspend your disbelief and present a dramatized sporting event.  WWF and WCW do this, and they suspend disbelief with various ""rules"", good match psychology, great selling, and also by using reasonable weapons in hardcore matches.  In the world of the match, it's reasonable to find a chair, table or even trashcan by the ring, and this continues to suspend my disbelief.  When I see a staple gun, a sword or cheese grater, my suspension of disbelief is shattered, because if a sword is legal, why give your opponent little nicks in the forehead?  Why not just stab him in the chest, or nail his hand to the ring post?  Because you can't fake that and the crowd wouldn't buy it.  Additionally, the XPW wrestlers inconsistently and badly sell the moves.  A forearm to the back put one guy in a daze for 15 seconds, and later a chair to the head didn't even knock him down!  I could go on, but XPW lacks all the charm, fun, and excitement of professional wrestling and basically amounts to the wrestlers coming out, walking around and blading themselves.",992908800,,1452,4.610894941634241
7935840,5,B00005AUEI,"I love this tape. from beginning to end. I think if you're a hardcore fan and an ECW fan, you should check this tape out. The main event is Terry Funk challenging Sabu for the XPW world title. This match is crazy. They pretty much brawl through the whole areana. My person favorite match is Supreme vs. The Messiah for the King Of The Deathmatch. This is as hardcore as any match could be. There are also some really good matches like the three way dance between Jimmy, Kronus, and ""White Trash"" Jonny Web. The six man tag match between The West Siderz (Kronic and Big Rott) and Carlito Montana taking on Halloween, Damien 666, and Rey Misterio Sr. More harcore action. And you'll see Kid Kaos in too good matches. The first one is an ""I quit"" match between Steve Razanno. The second is a ""Loser leaves town"" match against Tracy Smothers.
all and all, i think this is XPW best videos and I think all wrestling fans (Especially ECW Fans) should check it out.",986169600,2,957,4.443181818181818
