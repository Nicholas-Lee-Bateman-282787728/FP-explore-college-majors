8524115,5,B0081PUB14,"Funny-Weird. It is a slow burn, but definitely funny. A little nausea about Mummy, but just a bit. Everything is worth the bucks, though. Binge all the seasons and hope for more.",1517097600,,178,4.59375

8524118,5,B0081PUB14,"I've seen this series so many times when it was still on ITV but I still come back to it.  Some of the episodes are so crazy so funny that I honestly never get tired of watching them.  I think I'll be watching these on and off forever, whenever I need a good laugh.",1511395200,,265,3.888888888888889

8524120,5,B0081PUB14,"This is one of my favorite sit-coms, and it's certainly not for everyone.  If you like awkward British humor, then this is fantastic.  The ""first-person"" perspective may be disorienting to some people, but I think they've gotten better at using (or hiding) this device each season.  Marc and Jez continue their aimless bumbling through life, with plenty of awkward moments and unfortunate situations arising.",1494115200,2,408,5.34375
8524121,5,B0081PUB14,"This show is mental.  I laughed so hard, I didn't pee, but did manage
to fart at the same time.
 Be prepared for adult humor, and slightly crazed rock and roll.  Think ""friends"" plus
insanity, plus saying exactly what you think, so really, not like friends, more like seinfeld.
The show is unique both in the genius of the material and the way the characters
are like talking to each other through the camera.",1480896000,,409,4.5
