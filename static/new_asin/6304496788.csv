889815,5,6304496788,"This is simply the best of the historical martial arts films to come out of Hong Kong in the 1990s. If you are interested in Hong Kong pop cinema and are looking for a place to start, this is the film. The plot is accessible, the acting very good, and the action amazing.
Oddly enough, Iron Monkey wasn't a great success when it was released in Hong Kong in 1993. Perhaps it was seen as playing on the success of the Once Upon a Time in China films, as Monkey presents the classic hero Wong Fei-hung as a young boy. Regardless, this is more than equal to the best of the Once Upon a Time series.",912556800,,595,4.137931034482759

890088,5,6304496788,Great Kung Fu wire movie with DONNIE YEN,1450915200,,40,4.125
890089,5,6304496788,"Every martial arts movie Ive seen this year has been terrible. The Protector 2, Kickboxer, Blood Sport and a few others have almost made me want to give up on the genre altogether. Recently, my tattoo artist started talking about different movies with me, and it turned out we basically had the exact same taste, talking about not just great Kung Fu movies, but also great samurai ones too. One he brought up was Iron Monkey, a film I had completely forgotten about, since I saw it when I was younger and didn't understand the genre when I did see it. That same night I gave it a go and was impressed by how perfectly everything works together. The characters, plot, comedy, musicthis movie really has it all. While Im still not a fan of wire work and camera tricks to make something look cool, theres enough real action here to make me not care. Iron Monkey has shot up my list of favorite martial arts movies already, right up there with Kung Fu Hustle, The Protector, Drunken Master and others.

The Iron Monkey is basically the Robin Hood of China. He helps those in need, steals from the corrupt politicians and returns the money to people who can use it. Hes a sneaky ninja with all kinds of skills, able to easily evade anyone who comes after him. Who is the Iron Monkey? Yang Tianchun- the local physician! During the day, Yang takes care of the poor for free, and makes his living by charging wealthy patients, often wording things so that they want to pay, even after watching him let a poor person be examined for nothing. Recently, he made of with the governors chest of gold, and the top officer, Fox, has been tasked with finding the Iron Monkey, not knowing that the culprit is right under his nose. Elsewhere, Wong Kei-ying, another physician and expert fighter, arrives along with his son, Wong Fei-hung. After getting into a tussle with thugs, the police see how well Kei-ying, fights and suspect him of being the Iron Monkey. They take both him and his son in, along with dozens of other people, and demand that one of them admits to being the do-gooder, otherwise theyll all be taken to the dungeon. The real Iron Monkey shows up, makes a fool of the authorities, and does battle with Kei-ying, because he wants to prove his innocence. Despite the real Iron Monkey being RIGHT THERE, everyone is still held, but Kei-ying is let go on the grounds that he finds the Iron Monkey and brings him back to the palace. They hold his son and give him a few days to finish the job. What follows is a story of corruption, friendship and Bugs Bunny-style dress up!

Where do I even start with this one? So much happens in The Iron Monkey that the movie blows by in no time. Never once does it get boring or too predictable. It starts out with a fairly serious tone, showing how abusive the government was at that time in Chinese history, but lightens up as the film progresses. Like I said earlier, every aspect of this movie works perfectly with one another, creating a great mix of plot and action. I remember being disappointed with the first Ong-Bak, after many claimed it was the greatest action movie ever. When I saw it, it was 80% horribly boring plot and 20% fights. With the plot in Iron Monkey, its interesting and fun, and I loved the interaction between the characters. Yuen Shun-yi, who plays Fox, won me over with his character development, and how he portrayed the conflicted cop. Miss Orchid, played by the stupidly-stunning Jean Wang, holds her own with the Iron Monkey, acting as his partner and almost like a substitute, causing just as much mayhem as he does from time to time. I haven't seen very many of Donnie Yens movies, but his fight scenes here are incredible and I was rewinding the movie over and over to see how he did something and to make sure I was seeing it right. This is a guy who doesnt get enough credit. If you thought he was good in Ip Man, wait until you see this. And I have to give recognition to Angie Tsang, who played Wong Fei-hung. She is excellent when it comes to form and technique. Do a video search for her scenes at the very least if you don't get around to watching the movie.

I don't have any complaints about Iron Monkey. My only nitpicks are ones typical for Kung Fu movies, like using wires to up the action, making some things more dramatic. Its not overdone here though, and is mostly used in the first third of the movie. When it happens, I cant help but wonder how it wouldve been had they just let the actors do every stunt on their own. I should note that there were many changes made to the film when Miramax put it out in 2001. I looked over the list of changes and cant tell if all of them were still there when I streamed it. If you can, get the original version just to see the film how it was intended to be seen. Granted, some of the changes on the list are good ones (more realistic sound effects, etc.) but its still weird when studios do this.

Iron Monkey is one of those rare martial arts movies that has something for everyone, and can be viewed by people of any age. Theres very little blood, very few deaths, it has some touching family moments, and again, its never boring. I rarely buy movies these days, and yet this is one Im going to get just so I can let other people borrow it.",1448755200,2,5273,4.399590163934426

890268,3,6304496788,"When I first viewed this movie through the Amazon streaming. It is the Miramax release of the film.  I thought it was a great movie. I even watched it a few times. What I didn't know is what one of the other reviewers referenced in terms of things being cut from the movie. It wasn't only fights scenes cut it was the whole point of the movie. This is from the Wikipedia page about the movie:
""In its release in 2001, Miramax made several changes that the company felt would make it more marketable to American audiences:

  As most Americans are unfamiliar with the story of Wong Fei-hung, his name was removed from the original Chinese title.
  The subtitles were tailored to diminish the political context of the story.
  Some scenes were trimmed to tone down the violence.
  Originally, some fight scenes had been sped up in places through undercranking. The United States release slowed these scenes down to more normal pace.
  Several comedic scenes, particularly ones interspersed in the fight scenes, were removed to give the fights a more serious feel. Although such comedic devices are common in Hong Kong cinema, the editors felt that they might appear odd to American audiences.
  A new soundtrack was composed that emulated the classical score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but in doing so, the Wong Fei-hung theme song was eliminated.
  New sound effects were dubbed for the fighting to make them more realistic (as opposed to the more traditional exaggerated Hong Kong sounds).""

I ordered a Chinese produced version of the film and it is TOTALLY different. I did have to allow for the less than stellar subtitle translations, but I could still see how much of the message of this story had been removed. I don't know why the political themes of the movie would need to be butchered as they were. This is a historical telling of how the young boy became a great Chinese hero, but a lot of that element and the real sentiments of the movie maker was watered down for us Americans. Its a shame.
I like the Miramax version for the clear coherent properly spelled subtitles and great screen quality, but that could have been done while keeping the full spirit of the film.

Do your research as many of the Chinese language films have versions that are changed and sanitized for our consumption.",1421971200,20,2310,4.7325

890408,4,6304496788,"I was never a big fan of Kung Fu movies and it took me years to come to appreciate how wonderfully whimsical they can be. Watching this film cemented that appreciation.

Here's the scoop. China is falling apart politically and folk from the rural areas are fleeing to the cities in hopes of finding food and security. Instead they find themselves being taken advantage of by charlatans and officials alike. A local hero, The Iron Monkey, steps up to right the wrongs.

This is a wonderful and efficient film. The story is crisp. At a trim 90 minutes it doesn't squander the viewer's time budget. It goes from one scene to the next as quickly as possible without seeming rushed. But then there are the fight scenes. Excellent wire work and crazy, impossible things happen in abundance. A couple of ideas were used in later films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Batman Begins"" so you know those directors must have been impressed as well. But this has everything. The under cover hero. His gorgeous assistant. The foe turned friend and his son who must help save the day. The fight choreography is astounding as is the execution. It's shot and cut well and the night time lighting, with a blue tinge, looks really cool.

Hats off to Quentin Tarentino for getting this into the public eye. It's a martial arts classic that deserves a place in the genre's history.",1402876800,2,1351,4.668067226890757

Like Robin Hood, the Iron Monkey robs from the rich and gives to the poor, but instead of wielding a bow and arrow and sword, he wears a mask and uses martial arts weapons instead.

By day, Chinese doctor Yang Tianchun (Rongguang Yu) is a physician caring for the poor and rich alike, but at night he's the Iron Monkey, a high-kicking do-gooder assisting those in need who are suffering beneath the rule of the corrupt governor.

Meanwhile, Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen) and his son Wong Fei-hong (Sze-Man Tsang) come into town. Soon after, Wong Kei-Ying is captured on suspicion of being the Iron Monkey after being observed in battle. His son is arrested as well. In an effort to clear himself, he offers to capture the real Iron Monkey, his son being forced to remain in prison to ensure his compliance.

Soon Wong Kei-Ying and the Iron Monkey meet and, after going toe-to-toe with no victor, form an alliance that will rescue Wong Fei-hong from prison and bring down the evil governor once and for all.

This movie kicks some serious wa-hoo-hoo and I'm not just saying that because of the awesome kung fu sequences, but because of it's fun presentation of a classic story--Robin Hood--through the lens of Chinese culture, martial arts and fast-paced action.

Quentin Tarantino brought the flick over to the West and I'm glad he did. I'm 99% sure I went to the theatre to check this gem out and it soon got a place in my DVD collection once it hit store shelves.

What can I say? The fight sequences are over-the-top--wire acts, crazy fast kicks--but those are what make kung fu movies great and give the fight performances that supernatural feel that can't be obtained otherwise.

The superhero fan part of me had never seen a kung fu superhero movie, and when I compare it to the Western version of martial arts techniques that we get in our own superhero flicks, sadly, we come up short every time. I mean, this crazy, fast-paced over-the-top form of fighting is one of the main reasons The Matrix became so popular.

There is lots that goes on in this movie story-wise, everything from the simple rob-from-the-rich-to-feed-the-poor angle to Wong Kei-Ying's tense relationship with his son, to commentary on oppression and what's fair and what isn't, to comedic moments, tear-jerking moments, to adrenaline-fueled action--it's a full experience, something that Quentin Tarantino said in an interview on the DVD that is common in Chinese cinema but not really over here in the West. I think we need to learn a thing or two about moviemaking from our Chinese friends instead of compartmentalizing everything into genres and niches.

If you love folk heroes like Robin Hood, or are a superhero fan, Iron Monkey should definitely be on your watch list.",1363305600,,2763,4.797894736842105
890570,5,6304496788,"I have been a student and instructor of numerous martial arts (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Kobudo, Kenjutsu, Law Enforcement Defensive Tactics etc) for more than 60 years. I have also become a fan of the Asian martial arts films such as the award winning Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and countless other martial art films.  This one is in my top ten list of fantastic martial arts films.  The acting and colorful scenes in combination with some of the most intense and mind-blowing martial arts action makes this a must own DVD.

The story is one to love because it is about the little guy overcoming government corruption, which is something we can all relate to if you live in the Chicgo, lllinois area.  The secretive Iron Monkey slinks along in the dead of night to fight for the oppressed people.  The government authorities resort to some underhanded tactics to catch the Iron Monkey, but they fail.

In conclusion, if you like martial arts films with an excellent story combined with fantastic fight action scenes, you will want to see and own this great movie.

890624,5,6304496788,"This is a hidden gem of a movie.  Old school fighting and a cast of characters brings this to life.  Donnie Yen was introduced to me in this film and I have marveled at his kung fu since that time.  I think love the old time Chinese kung fu movies because unlike American movies sometimes main characters die.  Chinese film makers are more concerned with great story telling rather than a money-making, tepid sequel.

It's a great story.  The music & costumes for the time period are impeccable.  The rural feel of warlords and dynasties long lost abound in this wonderful movie.  The cast of characters are vast and well balanced.  The story is well thought out and played out with characters with great thought and skill in kung fu which elegant, fast yet reasonably believable (although everything is on wires now).

I hate spoiling a movie so here is the gist.  The story is set in China.  It is a forgotten time long ago when corruption and evil powers surround and consume their inhabitants.  But new hero's rise up and unexpected ones are made through adversity.  OK, sorry, can't say anymore, I love this movie too much and the movie experience is so scarce now that I just can't say more without ruining it for you.

890627,4,6304496788,"I don't claim to have seen all of Yuen Woo-Ping's films, but I'm fairly comfortable pimping IRON MONKEY as one of the very best in his oeuvre. IRON MONKEY delves into popular Chinese folklore, chronicling a period in the lives of famed kung fu master Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen), of the renowned ""Ten Tigers of Canton,"" and his young son Wong Fei-Hong (Tzang Tse-Man) who would grow up to become one of China's most idolized historical figures. Would you believe neither one is the most relevant character in this film?

The year is 1858, in the town of Chekiang, wherein the stench of corruption lingers and permeates. Chekiang's governor is blatant in his abuse of power, a cruel leech that inexorably sucks the life out of his fearful subjects. But, for the past few years, there has been one stopgap, one thorn in the side, one champion of the oppressed. The real star of the film is Dr. Yang (Yu Rong-Guang), a charitable physician who, along with his beauteous associate Miss Orchid (Jean Wang), tends to the sick during the day. But when the sun dips low, he dons a mask and ventures out as the indomitable Iron Monkey, righting wrongs and generally making the governor look like a chump. In his nighttime jaunts, the Iron Monkey is sometimes accompanied by Miss Orchid who flaunts her own impressive brand of kung off. Essentially, Iron Monkey is like Robin Hood or Zorro, just with more dim-sum and shark fin soup in the backdrop.

While the Iron Monkey and Miss Orchid dynamically uphold the fighting standard, the odds of us being treated to sublime kung fu increase exponentially with the arrival of young Wong Fei-Hong and his father, Wong Kei-Ying, also a physician. When a dust-up in the streets reveals Wong Kei-Ying's martial arts mastery, he is promptly detained, with the governor calling for his son to be thrown into prison. Wong Kei-Ying is given seven days to capture the Iron Monkey.

IRON MONKEY's original release was in 1993, overseas. Really, it wasn't until Quentin Tarantino attached his name to the film and introduced it to the U.S. in 2001 that them Yanks got a whiff. IRON MONKEY isn't as lyrical as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, which back then was deemed the current watershed film in martial arts cinema. It's certainly not as languid. The storytelling in IRON MONKEY is robust and more straightforward, and I love that it attempts to veer away from silly comedy bits, these comedy bits being a genre staple. IRON MONKEY presents a series of interesting story elements to propel things along, and the cast given enough solid character beats to generate rooting interest from you and from me. The four principals - the two doctors, Miss Orchid, and Wong Fei-Hong - each get moments to shine. One of the coolest bits of trivia about this film is that young Tzang Tse-Man, who plays the plucky Wong Fei-Hong, is a prodigious martial artist... and a girl.

I like the dramatic turns and the understated love story, but this film thrills the most during the exhilarating fighty fights. Yuen Woo-Ping, celebrated director and fight choreographer, is masterful in his staging of the action set pieces, and even with the copious wire work involved, Woo-Ping transforms motion and force into something like an art form. As per norm, a good number of the cast indulge in reckless rooftop traffic and dizzying aerial acrobatics. As a bonus, we eyeball a precarious final showdown that takes place on burning wooden posts, the Iron Monkey and his allies facing off against the menacing big bad, which isn't the governor but rather a depraved Shaolin turncoat who, by the way, casually commandeers the governor's nine wives. Not that I feel sorry for the governor. Nine wives is, like, five too many.

As usual, with these foreign pictures, I recommend that you view it in its original language. The DVD comes with English sub-titles. Because again, as usual, the English dubbing is... disappointing.

890724,3,6304496788,"Full of action and wonderful fighting choreography,

A remake of the 1970's film of the same name, the 1993 film ""Iron Monkey"" stars Rongugang Yu (""Musa the Warrior"", ""Shanghai Noon"", ""Midnight Express in Orient"" as Dr. Yang a.k.a. ""Iron Monkey"".

During a time when the poor were being mistreated by bandits, many tried to flock towards government officials for protection but finding mistreatment at a higher level as well.  So, the ""Iron Monkey"" is like an equivalent of Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give back to the poor.  But being the popular doctor in the village, no one suspects him of anything.

Dr. Yang works with Miss Orchid (Jean Wang, ""Once Upon a Time in China"" films, ""Swordsman III""), a woman who is also an impressive fighter but is seen as the shopkeeper at Dr. Yang's office.

But with a senator coming to visit the village, the current governor wants a search for Iron Monkey (who has stolen a lot of the governor's savings) and has his men try to capture anyone who may be the one who has been stealing from them.

One day, a man named Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen, ""Kill Zone"", ""Shanghai Affairs"", ""Hero"") and his son Wong Fei-Hung (Sze-Man Tsang) visit the village and make some purchases but when Wong Fei-Hung spots a child being bullied, he defends him by using a slingshot and shooting a rock at one of the bad juveniles.  But when his father takes the slingshot away, the bad bullies suspect he is the culprit and the father easily beats them.

Because the governor's men watched Wong Kei-Ying fight, they arrest both Wong Kei-Ying and his son.

While all men who were arrested try to plead to the governor that they are not Iron Monkey, the governor doesn't care and wants to imprison all of them.  But then the real Iron Monkey shows up and Wong Kei-Ying who wants to protect his son, gets into a fight with Iron Monkey and everyone is at awe at both men's martial arts.  The governor then cuts a deal with Wong Kei-Ying, if he catches the Iron Monkey, he will release his son to him.  If not, his son will be in prison forever.

With Wong Kei-Ying knowing that all he has is his son, he will do what he can to catch the Iron Monkey.  But he is quick to learn that the villagers are supportive of the Iron Monkey and will not feed him.  Being broke and having no money and knowing he has a week to catch the Iron Monkey, unbeknown to him, Miss Orchid takes him into their home for food and both she and Dr. Yang learn that his son has been captured and learn that the only way they will be free is if the Iron Monkey is killed.

Knowing that Wong Kei-Ying is being wronged, Dr. Yang (ala Iron Monkey) and Miss Orchid do what they can to help him.

It's important to not that Wong Kei-Ying's son is the Wong Fei-hung that is a Kung Fu hero in China.  The real man lived from 1847 through 1924 and was a master of the no-shadow kick, drunken boxing, the lion dance and Hung fist.  The character has been explored in a number of films which include the Jet Li ""Once Upon a Time in China"" films and for Jackie Chan in the ""Drunken Master"" films

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Iron Monkey"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For the most part, this 1993 film definitely looks better with the HD treatment than its 2002  DVD counterpart.  The picture quality looks much clearer and compared to the 1994 ""The Legend of Drunken Master"" film that is coming out on Blu-ray, ""Iron Monkey"" has less scratches and dirt.  For the most part, the film looks good, not great but good and better than DVD.

As for the audio, this is what will determine whether or not one will probably but it or not.  ""Iron Monkey"" is provided in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHZ/24-bit) lossless audio, while the original Chinese dialogue is only 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 2.0 digital.  I'm not going to add flame to the fire of whether or not to call an English dub bad or not, especially since I'm biased towards the original language.  But I also know there are many people who dislike reading films with subtitles and will put up with the English dialogue.  So, with that being the case, the English dub is much clearer and there are some scenes that utilize the surround channels.  But for the most part, the film features a lot of front and center channel usage with some thumps being heard on the surrounds.  I didn' t notice much LFE on the English dub either.

As for the original Chinese soundtrack, it is in 5.1 Dolby Digital but for the most part, at least with Blu-ray, you know that the 5.1 DD track is at a higher bitrate.  But yes, too many people, not having a lossless audio soundtrack is a deal breaker.

And of course, the  major deal breaker for many fans of ""Iron Monkey"" is that this is the edited version.  Scenes were cut out, some fixed up but the most significant change audio-wise is the replacement of the music.  Miramax wanted to capitalize on the popularity of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", so the music was changed to a classical score.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH and Spanish.  And yes, the subtitles have been revised as well to eliminate the political context of the film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Iron Monkey"" comes with two special features:

  * Quentin Tarentino Interview - (9:35) Quentin Tarentino talks about his passion for Kung Fu films.
  * Donnie Yen Interview - (6:21) Donnie Yen talks about how he got involved in martial arts and film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Iron Monkey"" is an entertaining martial arts film filled with interesting characters and wonderful fighting choreography.

Personally, this was one of the more memorable fighting films that dominated the 80's and early 90's but the controversy lies on the cutting and editing of the films for the US release.  Like ""The Legend of Drunk Master"", this release is going to be loved or hated by fans.

Again, I want to make it clear that this film has its best looking transfer to date on Blu-ray and much better than the previous 2002 DVD.  Picture quality is very good but not reference quality but for a 1993 film, it looks pretty good. But what it all comes down to is the viewer and what they want are expecting from this film.

For those who have a disdain towards watching films with English subtitles, you're going to get a solid English dubbed soundtrack via its lossless English 5.1 DTS-HD audio.  Fight scenes sound very good and although not an immersive soundtrack, it's still quite solid.  Again, I'm not going to debate if the English dubbing is good or bad because everyone has their own opinion on dubs and personally, I'm biased towards the films with its original language but at the same time, I know plenty of people who are unable to enjoy a film with subtitles and thus needs the English dub.

But for those who have been waiting for the uncut release, this is not it.  The film has the edited scenes, revised subtitles and also the music change but at least the Chinese audio via Dolby Digital 5.1 was still included.  It may not be lossless but I'm glad it was included (unlike ""The Legend of Drunken Master"" which doesn't have it nor does it have the original ending scene) but still, with the revisions made, purists will not be satisfied and its understandable.

So, needless to say...it's going to be a love or hate release among fans.  As a fan of the film, one can either wait and hope that an import uncut release of the film makes it to Blu-ray.  Or perhaps maybe purchasing this latest release with the better picture quality, better lossless audio than the original DVD.

But with that said, ""Iron Monkey"" is still an entertaining martial arts film that has an enjoyable storyline, enjoyable characters and awesome fight choreography.  ""Iron Monkey"" one of my favorite Donnie Yen films but unfortunately, it's not the uncut/unrevised version that I was hoping for.  But again, if you enjoyed the original US DVD release and don't mind the revisions, then this is the definitive version to own.",1252972800,19,7958,4.550632911392405

This is the original version of Iron Monkey released in Hong Kong in 1993. As far as I can tell, it's the only Region 1 version of the original edit available right now. Unlike the Miramax version, it includes uncut fight scenes and the original music and sound effects, while dispensing with the explanatory prologue. That, however, is the best that can be said for this version.

My final option in buying a worthy DVD edition is the one i own, posted right behind this one in the DVD edition list for this 1993 awesome classic. Unfortunately, this version is the only one available for now, in this store.

If you knew about this movie because of its reputation of being the best, most entertaining kung fu flick, with the most outstanding staged fights and choreografies ever filmed, i have a recomendation for you, future fan of this incredible masterpiece in action and martial arts: Rent this edition so you can meet with this awesome experience, and if you like what you are watching, go to a Martial arts DVD store, online or not, to get the edition i own. I take full responsability. But only if you like martial arts classics in their original full lenght uncut versions, with the original music score, both mandarin and cantonese languages, and more extra material about the movie instead of just trailers. For me at least, these great classics must be seen in their original versions, the ones that reflect the original feeling and the director's real intention. But you might know what happened to this martial arts DVD industry and specially Yuen Woo Ping films, after the international success of ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"". This Edition is just another example.

Trust me, i will never forgive myself for giving this movie 3 stars, DVD edition or not. The movie is 4,5 at least. The characters are powerful with individual perfect fighting styles, the story is entertaining as it can be, the rapid-fire action is intense, the coreographies are out of this word... It's just too much! Watch out for the ""Monk"" with the buddist palm, the female assasin with the ""eagle"" style, The iron ""monkey"" with...you know. Donnie Yen is an athlete, no doubt. And master coreographer and art director Yuen Woo Ping, brings his best production since his all-time kung fu classic, ""Drunken Master"".

Corruption filled the town

So Iron Monkey robbed the rich

And let it trickle down

The police force? A laughing stock

The Governor? A thief!

Martial arts the Monkey used

To give the poor relief

One day a stranger came to town

His young son right behind

Blackmailed by the Governor

The Monkey he must find

As movies go, the two combine

After a bit of fuss

They fight the ugly, and the bad

And not one you should miss

890923,4,6304496788,"Iron Monkey is one of those Hong Kong fight films that combine a simple but entertaining plot with brilliant fight choreography in just the right amounts to keep the viewer's attention throughout.  Set in 19th Century China it begins as the story of Dr. Yang (Yu Rong-guang) who has undertaken to right the wrongs of the greedy provincial governor by moonlighting as the Iron Monkey - a Zorro like character who leaps from roof to roof, often with the governor's illicit takings in his bag.  Dr. Yang's beautiful assistant Miss Orchid (Jean Wang), is also the Iron Monkey's faithful sidekick.

Governor Cheng (James Wong) is foaming at the mouth in his efforts to catch the Iron Monkey.  Herbalist and martial arts wizard Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen) and his son Fei-Hung (Sze-man Tsang) are drawn in first to help the governor and then as co-conspirators with Dr. Yang.  However, the governor is not the worst problem.  An imperial investigator who is both utterly evil and a grandmaster of the Shaolin fighting style comes to look into the Iron Monkey mystery and doctor, nurse, herbalist and son are all fighting for their lives.

Even though the story is an excellent one, and the Chinese actors do a fine job, the real test of a Hong Kong fight film is its fights.  Choreographer Yuen manages to create action that is surprisingly believable, despite all the 30 foot leaps into the sky and an entire scene done on the tips of poles set in a blazing fire.  I actually feel that the work is better than that of Crouching Tiger.  The action in Iron Monkey is very tight, while in Crouching Tiger they seem to bobble at the ends of cords.  And the physical fighting in between leaps is genuinely dazzling.

There are a couple of complaints about the subtitles, but I never felt they were out of place or awkward.  Unless you are an expert at Cantonese I don't think the disparities will bother you.  This is as fun a fight film to watch as any I've seen.",1119657600,5,1953,4.6231884057971016

Sure some of it is far fetched, but overall it is done so well you just don't care.  I bought this movie at the same time as ""Evil Cult"" and there is no comparison between the two.  Evil Cult looked lame beside Iron Monkey.

890925,4,6304496788,"Still in awe from the international hit, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Well, Iron Monkey will definetly satisfy those looking for a less artsy, more action-laden flick.

Yuen Wo Ping, the fight choreographer for CTHD, struts his stuff creating the martial-arts mayhem in this film as well. The high-flying acrobatics (with some help from wires), the flurry of kicks and punches, and exaggerated impacts all help make the scenes appear as if it were a dance. This isn't to say the characters are prancing and flying around everywhere all the time, but rather, these elements are used to support and build upon the base hardcore kung-fu combat. Even if you're geared toward more physical, realistic fights (ala Ong Bak), you can't deny the certain charm of Iron Monkey. I consider myself a slight detractor from ""wirefu"", but it's impossible NOT to be in awe of the masterfully-concocted mysticism of Yuen's fight scenes. The numerous battles are all somewhat different from each other, keeping the action alive and fresh throughout. Creativity really shines. Like all good kung-fu movies, Iron Monkey provides memorable fights that you'll even remember down the road. So sit back and be sure to absorb the beauty of Yuen's work.

Ok, enough of my babbling about the action. As you can all see, I love the fights. However, it's time to move on to other aspects of the movie. You can read the summary from almost any other review, so I won't bother with that. It is in the story that one can make the argument CTHD and IM are two completely different movies. CTHD uses action to support and enhance the wonderful plot-driven movie, whereas IM uses a story to bring you from one fantastic fight to another. Don't get me wrong...for a kung-fu flick, the story is developed alot better than what's normally adequate. Although providing some history for the characters is a nice touch, it's hardly inspected thoroughly.

The actors make the story work. Each person is casted convincingly. The young girl who played the part of Wong Fei Hung has serious skill! I also loved the major bad-guy. He brings back memories from the classic, old-school kung-fu flicks. Embodying a powerful arrogance, an elaborate costume, the whimsical 'stache and beard, and (most importantly) the Buddha Fist(!), Yee Kwan Yan makes for one kick-ass villain.

The only things that keep this movie from a perfect score are trivial matters. I feel the wire-effects were abit overdone in the earlier parts of the movie (although it was somewhat fitting to go along with the light-hearted mood during the beginning). However, in defense, the fights do heat up as the movie progresses. Another problem is the aforementioned weak history guide to the characters. In defense yet again, the movie still provided more plot substance than what kung fu flicks are normally creditted with.

Iron Monkey is not as artful and elaborate as Crouching Tiger, but the film never aims to be. It was made to be an action packed kung-fu movie, which it definetly delivers in spades. The names Donnie Yen and Yuen Wo Ping should be reason alone to get you on the couch, glued to the TV.

The film takes place during the latter part of the Manchu Dynasty where Dr. Yang is a local physician who runs a clinic with his wife by day but fights and steals from corrupt government officials by night as the Robin Hoodesque folk hero ""Iron Monkey"". The fight scenes in this film are constant and incredible. I particularly liked the pace that they were conducted in and in some ways this movie reminded me of the 1970s Kung-Fu films I used to watch during Saturday afternoons as a kid, respectfully. My main complaint with this film is that the subtitles do not stay on the television screen long enough to read them making it difficult to follow the dialogue. The fight scene at the end with Iron Monkey and Wong fighting the Chinese overlord on flaming wooden poles was incredible. I ended up following the advice of one reviewer and bought the Hong Kong version of this film which can also be bought at Amazon. If the U.S. release of this film (which I have not seen) is a watered-down, edited version then the Hong Kong version is certainly worth the wait.",1109376000,4,1208,4.623255813953488

WOW.  I hit the jackpot!  Rough and comic unlike the serious and elegant Hero.  Chinese, Chinese, Chinese unlike the Hollywood Jackie Chan Knights.  Plenty of martial arts and good natured humor.  From the corrupt Governor and his many giggling wives to the evil monk who -- opps there go the many giggling wives -- to Master Fox, the heart of gold police chief, all the bad guys are comics.  When the Governor orders that Iron Monkey must be arrested, the police round up an acrobat who jumps like a monkey, a man who sneezes like a monkey, a man selling...someone leans over and whispers, ""Don't even say the word Monkey,"" but he gets nabbed, too.  Even the serious Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu have a playful chopstick fight over a piece of roasted duck.

For those who love flying, there are many scenes with the beautiful antigravity choreography of Woo-Ping Yuen.  Probably the most lovely is the first, when the Doctor (Iron Monkey) and Miss Orchid (the nurse) go flying around the room to retrieve a stack of papers which has blown out of their hands at the end of a busy day at the clinic.

Although Iron Monkey's father had been killed unjustly and Miss Orchid's son, born of her work as a prostitute slave, dies at birth, in the present tense no one dies which is as it should be with a good old fashioned folk story.  Five stars!",1108080000,3,1492,4.5018587360594795
890928,4,6304496788,"After watching films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Shaolin Soccer and immensely falling for them, I had some hesitancy with this film.  With Tarantino's name attached to the previews, I had this growing concern that Hollywood had gripped this film a bit too hard, thus squeezing out any remaining value or originality.  I had heard of the stories of Harvey ""Scissorhands"" and his ability to really do a number on these Asian films that find their way into our cinemas.  I have heard that if you ever really want to fully enjoy one of these films, do not touch those with the name Miramax stamped anywhere.  With this in mind, I believe you can see where the hesitancy was coming from, but I need to be honest, this wasn't a horrible film.  Using a pre-Wachowski brothers technique of wires instead of ""bullet-time"" effects, Iron Monkey quickly transformed from your average Shaolin film (if there is such a thing), to a very humorous, creative, and original film.

For some strange reason this film caught my eye and never let go.  The strong blend between action and comedy rivals that of most modern Hollywood big-budget features.  The impeccable timing of the actors, the perfection of each of the dance-like fights, and its ability to transcend from one genre to another is what really gave this film a big boost in my eyes.  While I was expecting a notorious film full of girth and power, I was not in any way expecting this prize-winning, genre-jumping, symposium of pleasure.  Everything from the balloonish characters to the simple, yet structured, story pushed this film beyond others of similar nature.  I cannot express how impressed that I was with Iron Monkey and how it helped bring the martial arts film back into American homes.

Another element that I enjoyed immensely in this film was the mystic forces behind the characters.  The different Shaolin techniques impressed me and helped give the characters a masked depth to them.  Being relatively new to this genre, I am constantly impressed by the power, creativity, and ingenuity of the basic moves that Shaolin implies while in battle.  In this film, it was the ""Buddha Palm"" that made me utter the infamous Keanu line, ""Whoa"".  While this film wasn't perfection in a nutshell, it was enjoyable to go back to some of these ""classics"" and see where our now-modern films are borrowing their style.  It is good to see the strength and ability of someone fresh instead of Hollywood Jackie Chan in these roles.  Asian cinema is one of the most impressive genres in film, and continually it proves that it can break old molds and stereotypes by revamping them while still paying homage to the originals.  It is a genre, unlike Hollywood, that actually pays honest respect to the proceeding films that gave them this opportunity, and while Iron Monkey isn't Criterion-esque, it does provide several hours of countless fun and mind-challenging action.

Finally, you cannot talk about a film like this without mentioning the action.  I grew up in a house that prided itself on the popularity of the action film, and while my tastes have changed considerably over the years, it is always a pleasure to revisit in my mind those childhood days.  Now, when I go back to visit my family, I take films like Iron Monkey and Shaolin Soccer to bring a new style of action into the home.  It continues to be an instant hit.  This film was no different.  From the quick hand and leg combat, to the creative use of nearly every random inanimate object around, to the different elements of nature that are brought in to bring more thrill to the table, this film had everything and kept the enjoyment level high.  That says a lot for a little Asian film that found itself corrupted by America.

Overall, I was very impressed with this film.  With my growing infatuation with this genre of film, I cannot wait to get my hands on more.  While I wish that Miramax would not try to take these films to the butcher's block, they still provide several hours of enjoyment and plenty of action.  In intensity and insanity of the actors help create a world where you believe in the impossible kung-fu move and allow even more punches to follow.  This was a great film that should be enjoyed with subtitles (never dubbing) and without the Tarantino introduction.  Check it out, I do not think it will bring disappointment.

890929,4,6304496788,"Iron Monkey was originally released in Hong Kong almost

11 yrs (1993) ago, but it's until now, with America's love

affair with Martial Arts films, has it come to the USA.

It's original title was ""Iron Monkey: The Young Wong Fei Hong"".

Directed by Yuen Wo Ping who choreographed a couple of

the exciting battle scenes. It's one of the first martial

arts films to use elements of eastern and western culture.

For example, the music has been redone with a James Venable score. Even Quentin Tarantino was overlooking the movie before it was released.

The story is set in China 1858, when corrupt officials

took advantage of poor refugees. In the city of Chekian, a greedy and low life governor named Chen (James Wong)is stealing food supplies and spends most of his time having sex with 9 wives!!! Yes nine wives!!!

Well the people of Chekia are sick of this jerk and they

want someone to take him out. That's where the Iron Monkey (Yu Rong-Guang) comes in. He is a just a master at martial arts and his appearence in black cast a fear over his enemies.

In fact at one point in the movie, he shaves of the governor's eyebrows (talk about a close shave). The security chief (Yuen Shun-Yi) tries to captures the Iron Monkey but can't.

What I loved about the movie, besides the breathtaking action scenes is the story itself revolving corruption and the need for a hero to rid the city of evil and bad individuals.

Also I loved the fact that Iron Monkey has a secret identity

like Spiderman and Superman. No one suspects his real identity which is that of a herbalist. However, the movie further gets intriguing as another herbalist comes into town with his son. The evil governor kidnaps the herbalist's son and won't release him until someone captures the Iron Monkey.

To complicate matters, an evil monk comes into the pictures

and plans to take the Iron Monkey out. One other thing I loved about the movie, is the arsenal of moves every fighting character has. One has a Shaolin fist, while another has a flying sleeve move. Of course, the stunts are tremendous including the duel at the end, which would make even Jackie Chan pleased.

Released by Miramax, Iron Monkey is a good sign that more great Martial Arts films will be released in the US for us action fans to appreciate.

This particular story sets out to explain how Wong Fei Hung developed as he did, showing his relationship with his father and with an influential herbalist who inspires the inner Robin Hood in the boy. There isn't a lot of character development in the character, because there doesn't need to be. The target audience already knows Wong Fei Hung very well. The star of this movie is the action.

The action is similar between the two films, because they're both drawing on the fantasy style of fighting. All that soaring, the posturing from wires. Mythical folks doing mythical things. But where Crouching Tiger takes itself pretty seriously (befitting an epic romance), Iron Monkey is more laid back. There's some of the typical slapstick between father and son and one funny scene where all that lyrical soaring is put to a very mundane use.

It's like comparing, oh, My Name is Nobody to High Noon. They may be the same genre, but beyond that, they don't have much in common. (And that said, if you haven't seen My Name is Nobody, remedy that. As soon as you can.)

If you haven't seen Iron Monkey, and you like this kind of thing, you should remedy that, too.  As soon as you can.

An interesting bit of trivia: the little boy in Iron Monkey is actually a little girl. A very athletic one.",1103414400,,1674,4.635135135135135

890998,5,6304496788,"Iron Monkey was originally released in Hong Kong almost

11 yrs (1993) ago, but it's until now, with America's love

affair with Martial Arts films, has it come to the USA.

It's original title was ""Iron Monkey: The Young Wong Fei Hong"".

Directed by Yuen Wo Ping who choreographed a couple of

the exciting battle scenes. It's one of the first martial

arts films to use elements of eastern and western culture.

For example, the music has been redone with a James Venable score. Even Quentin Tarantino was overlooking the movie before it was released.

The story is set in China 1858, when corrupt officials

took advantage of poor refugees.  In the city of Chekian, a greedy and low life governor named Chen (James Wong)is stealing food supplies and spends most  of his time having sex with 9 wives!!! Yes nine wives!!!

Well the people of Chekia are sick of this jerk and they

want someone to take him out.  That's where the Iron Monkey (Yu Rong-Guang) comes in. He is a just a master at martial arts and his appearence in black cast a fear over his enemies.

In fact at one point in the movie, he shaves of the governor's eyebrows (talk about a close shave).  The security chief (Yuen Shun-Yi) tries to captures the Iron Monkey but can't.

What I loved about the movie, besides the breathtaking action scenes is the story itself revolving corruption and the need for a hero to rid the city of evil and bad individuals.

Also I loved the fact that Iron Monkey has a secret identity

like Spiderman and Superman. No one suspects his real identity which is that of a herbalist. However, the movie further gets intriguing as another herbalist comes into town with his son. The evil governor kidnaps the herbalist's son and won't release him until someone captures the Iron Monkey.

To complicate matters, an evil monk comes into the pictures

and plans to take the Iron Monkey out.  One other thing I loved about the movie, is the arsenal of moves every fighting character has. One has a Shaolin  fist, while another has a flying sleeve move.  Of course, the stunts are tremendous including the duel at the end, which would make even Jackie Chan pleased.

Released by Miramax, Iron Monkey is a good sign that more great Martial Arts films will be released in the US for us action fans to appreciate.

The dvd is superb with many extra features. Enjoy.",1093305600,,2353,4.609638554216867
890999,5,6304496788,"This movie is so much fun to watch. The action scenes are fast and exciting, while also showing why Donnie Yen is the man. I bought this movie after reading some great reviews and I am pleased that I did. If you haven't yet, rent or buy this one now.",1092873600,,250,4.02
891000,5,6304496788,"This is the kung fu movie that started my obsession!  I had always been a fan of action/fight films(Arnold, Van Damme, etc.), but Iron Monkey changed it all.  Now my favorites are badasses like Donnie Yen, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan.  This movie is full of jaw-dropping fights and great humor!  You must understand that Chinese humor is not like ours but you cannot help smiling at their antics in this film.  Some of it is pretty funny, not just silliness as in some older Jackie Chan films.  The fighting is all choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping which automatically means it is some of the best on film.  There is probably a fight scene every ten minutes ranging from one on one matchups to group fights to weapons battles.  This one has it all.

Donnie Yen is phenomenal!  He is so good in this that you will be dying to see more of his films.  Iron Monkey could be his best though.  His lightening quick kung fu will keep your eyes glued to the screen and he is not even the main character!  Yu Rong Guang as the Iron Monkey is second to none as the Robin Hood of China(except this hero will just beat you senseless, and then rob you).  As fast as Yen and amazing with weapons, he shows you why he is the hero of the people and the enemy of the corrupt leaders.

As for the DVD, the picture is in anamorphic widescreen and is a very high quality.  The sound is very good and can be heard in its original language with subtitles or dubbed in english.  As far as dubbing goes, this is definitely above average.  The only drawback to this edition is some of the scenes(both regular and fight scenes) are cut short a little bit.  The HK version(the one with the green cover) is uncut but does not have as high of a video quality.

Personally I hate watching movies with subtitles so it was great to see it in dubbed version especially after having seen it in chinese at the theatre.
The movie was great but one problem with it is that the flying in the movie just as in Crouching Tiger is a little too much and should concentrate more on actual martial arts fighting seens other then that I loved the movie. The movie has a great story line too. For anyone who loves martial arts movies I suggest buying this DVD.",1074729600,,725,4.377777777777778

891036,5,6304496788,"It's amazing that this guy gets overlooked as much as he does.  He has an outstanding pedigree, and it shows-- he's better and faster than Jet Li!  In my book, Donnie Yen is the best kung fu stylist in show business today!
That being said, Iron Monkey is one of the better films that I've seen him in.  Nice cinematogrpahy that highlights the gorgeous fight scenes, an interesting storyline, and best of all, Donnie Yen featured in over half the scenes-- choreographed by him!
There is wirework in the fight scenes, but it does not overshadow them.  There isn't any strobe-effects, or a lot of cutaways to make the actors seem quicker than they are.. the fight scenes are dynamic, with some nice camerawork that actually enhances.  There are elements of Hong Kong kung fu B movies that work, and the action isn't so ridiculously fast that you can't keep up with it.  You can appreciate Donnie Yen's form-- he bases his chroegraphy for his character on the real historical hero-- who studied hung gar.  Except for the ""Shadow Kick"" technique, which has to be seen to be believed.  Remember Bruce Lee throwing three fast roundhouse like kicks to Chuck Norris' face in Return of the Dragon, and thinking that was fast?  Slow motion, folks.  And Donnie gives us the impression of more internal power.  Smokin!
The basis for this story is Robin Hood in China-- not quite as sappy as old kung fu B movies, not nearly as ""revolutionary"" in terms of storyline quality as ""Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero.""  But solid.
I'd like to see Donnie get features more often.  I'd like to see more quality movies that feature kung fu action.  Here's a good one.",1066348800,6,1651,4.6875
891037,5,6304496788,"Okay, I'm behind the times.  I'm just now catching ""Iron Monkey"" and feel pretty much like a Johnny-Come-Lately.

Recently, however, I found the movie at a pre-owned cd/dvd store and purchased it.  I'm glad I did because it ranks right up there with ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"".  Yuen Woo-ping's chinese take on Robin Hood is done with great style, incredible fight choreography and filled with charming actors and actresses.  Yu Rong-gang plays the Iron Monkey and Dr. Yang, a humble doctor that basically practices the same tactics as the Iron Monkey---helping the poor who are sick for free and charging the rich for his help.  The rest of the cast is filled with interesting characters such as Dr. Yang's helper and romantic interest, Miss Orchid, and Wong Fei-hung, a young boy who's fighting skills are as remarkable as many adult men.

I have shown this movie to several friends who don't like martial arts movies, but they loved this one.  The story is about a Chinese hero, Iron Monkey.  He is similar to Robin Hood or Zorro in methodology.  He works primarily as a doctor during the day, but at night he whips around town in a sleek black ninja outfit.

The plot, paper thin as it was, focuses on a masked hero that steals from the corrupt rich lords of a provincial chinese city to give to the poor and oppressed. The side line of another martial arts master, whose son is imprisoned by the loval governor, is forced to find this masked hero and kill him. Alirght the stage is now set for marvelous fight scenes, although most of them are quite rediculous. This film honestly feels more like a episode of the 1960's TV SERIES ""Batman"".

This remake (of the ~1986 original) combines the special effects of ""Crouching Tiger"" with a more concrete & less metaphoric tale of good-versus-evil in ancient China.  The plot involves the vagaries of politics, power, corruption and lust, counterbalanced by love and simple human compassion.  In many ways, the story is more concrete than ""Crouching Tiger"" even while the characters are more superhero-like (with daylight aliases, for example).  Furthermore, the story is simple yet compelling, and it does not merely dissolve into misty metaphor at the end.

891163,5,6304496788,"Why can't the people at Dimension Home video get it right for once??? They messed up every single martial arts movie release by not providing the original language tracks and cutting scenes. This time with Iron Monkey, they were wise enough to remaster the original chinese language track, but they still decide to cut. For me, cutting a fighting scene, especially if its the last one, is a no no...and I, like another reviewer here, love it when Wong Kei-Ying or Wong Fei Hung call out their special move (Shadowless Kick) before they actually do it. Anyways, for those that don't know, this movie was made in 1993 and it took long enough to come over here. This is a story of a Robin Hood like character who steals from the rich corrupt govt officials and gives to the poor towns people. He goes by the name of Iron Monkey (played by Rongguang Yu), a hero to the townspeople, and a wanted man by the officials. The officials are arresting anyone that looks suspicious. While in town to shop for medicine, Wong Kei-Ying (played by the awesome Donnie Yen) and his son, the very young Wong Fei Hung get in a quarrel with some thugs and get arrested for suspicion. The chief official learns of Wong Kei-Ying's great martial arts, and by force sends him to take out the Iron Monkey while his son Wong Fei Hung is held in custody. To make it simple, Wong Kei-Ying and the Iron Monkey will eventually team up and fight some interesting govt officials. Donnie Yen pretty much steals the show in this film as Wong Kei-Ying, and he is the reason why I watched it. His kicking ability and speed are just awesome. Yeun Woo Ping once again lends a hand in making a decent choreographed film. I must admit there is more wirework here than I would want to see, but thankfully Donnie saves it here. The kid that plays Wong Fei Hung (a boy?...I've heard it was a girl too) is pretty awesome in this movie as well. Basically, theres plenty of fighting action in this film to keep action fans happy, and the ones with Donnie Yen are the best. Now, to the dvd...quentin tarantino and Dimension is getting a lot of heat from me for the cutting. Folks, if you are able to play Region 2 PAL dvds...then the Hong Kong Legends version of Iron Monkey is the essential copy to own...completely uncut, remastered audio (Original Chinese and English) and video, and some interesting extras. If not, then get the Media Asia HK version (green box) for that is uncut as well, but not as crisp clear as the Region 2. I wrote this review in full support of Donnie Yen, he is one of the best martial artist to be caught on film. Check out his other greats such as In The Line of Duty IV, Tiger Cage 2, Wing Chun (alongside Michelle Yeoh), and OUATIC 2 (alongside Jet Li). For those that don't know, hes also the asian guy in Blade 2. Anyways, Iron Monkey is a classic and well worth your buck.

However, the story is good for a martial arts movie. Centering around a peoples hero, a young Wong Fei Hong, and a father who really needs to get some R&R.
The martial arts exhibited are top notch. The movie is filled to the brim with action scenes, with just enough story to get you behind the characters who are fighting, good or evil. Mostly hand to hand martial arts with a few sword and pole fightings scenes for good measure. Fans of Wong Fei Hong may be disappointed to find that there is little to no depiction of the art he presumably created, which is Hung Gar.

891257,4,6304496788,"Like a page right out of the 60's ""Batman and Robin"" series, the masked vigilante Iron Monkey, possessing the modus oprandi of Batman and the heart of Robin Hood, is the champion of justice in a small town in 19th century China.  Like Batman, he has a dual identity, battling evil and corruption at night while masquerading as a law-abiding citizen by day, he has a bag full of gimmicks, and he has a sidekick.
In this episode/movie of the exciting adventures of the eastern Dark Knight and Miss Orchid, the Girl Wonder, corrupted town governor Cheng, the `Sheriff of Nottingham', with his assistant Chief Fox, a homage to Chief O'Hara, called upon a visiting pugilist warrior and his much-more-famous partner/son (think Green Hornet and Kato) to capture the Dark Knight.  Just when the home hero and his visiting counterpart are about to clash in grand spectacle, they joined forces against an evil threat in the form of a renegade Shaolin monk.
It does not take a genius to realize that this is no ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and the differences do not stop with the action scenes.  While ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a magnificent work in many respects, ""Iron Monkey"" is not.  Aside from the action scenes, there is nothing of substance about the film.  Direction and cinematography are lackluster.  The storyline is grossly thin, as well as far-fetched and unbelievable.  It is unrealistic to think that a pre-teen kid can not only fight but also be able to beat up adults single-handedly; or a villainous monk ascending to a government position despite his checkered past and current ignoble accomplishments, without any opposition whatsoever.  Adding to the negatives is bad dubbing.  The characters are often heard speaking without moving their lips.  Horrible editing of sound and picture only makes matters worse.
Yet the only gold mine of this movie, which makes it entertaining despite its many flaws, is the action sequences.  They are abundant in quality and quantity.  This undoubtedly establishes the standard in which all martial arts films will be judged, which American martial arts action flicks should follow but do not.  American martial arts films rely on machismo and natural charisma of the actors to carry the film, an approach that often dies of boredom especially since their fight scenes are frequently one-sided.  Chinese martial arts films have breathtaking fight choreographies that emphasize on creativity and improvisation, so even if the same style is utilized the approach makes it look fresh and original.  Besides the actors' expressing themselves beautifully in their own unique martial arts background, their repertoire of weapons include ladders, umbrellas, chains, metal balls, wooden benches and ... flaming bamboo poles (you have to see it to believe it!).  Not only do all of the main characters participated in the fighting, they were also defined by their own styles on-screen: Iron Monkey being acrobatically-inclined; the Girl Wonder dancing her movements like a ballerina; `Green Hornet' excessive use of his legs including drawing an arc with the tip of his toes as a pre-fight stance; `Kato's cockiness and use of bamboo pole, a foreshadow to his future destiny; and the Villain being hands-and-claws for the most part.
One can fault an action film for its lack of everything else, but ""Iron Monkey"" does put films of van Damme and Rothrock's to shame, or to the level of slow-motion tai-ji, or better yet to oblivion.  Definitely enjoyable, even if its only for the fight sequences.",1005436800,,3547,5.098445595854923

Imagine Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now take out the love story. Replace with Robin Hood type plot. Throw in more action. Spice with even more action, and you have Iron Monkey.
The movie is subtitled (which is worth mentioning since the theatre I saw it at said people were actually returning their tickets when they found this out, *sigh*). However, this is a good thing, because it serves to add to the credibility of this film where dubbing would have made the film appear campy.
Anyway, the movie is not just a big fight scene. It does have a story about good, evil, honor, friendship, loyalty, generosity, discipline, and corruption.
If you've ever enjoyed a kung-fu film, then see this because it's one of the best. If you haven't, this would be a good first endeavour.",1003622400,2,870,4.583333333333333
891312,5,6304496788,"What an incredible display of motion on screen. That Iron Monkey has amazing fight choreography is a given but what amazes me many times in these movies is how even with all the non-stop action they still seem to get in some descent character development. Let's face it. You can have the best fights ever but if you don't care at all about the people it's only good for one viewing and we're here looking for multiple viewing, right kids!
The chinese actors are incredibly adept at using few words and clever use of body language to convey as much in one scene that Stallone or Willis can't produce in an entire movie. The problem in the U.S. is that acting is not really infused with any real physical ability like in Asia. Often from a young age martial arts are a part of a performer or actors life. Some more than others. Someone in the US who has studied for the physical abilities probably can't act their way out of a paper bag because it hasn't been a part of growing up for them. The prime example being good ol' Chuck Norris.
Just say thanks that we in the U.S. can finally get good access to these action masterpieces. This movie is Fist of Legend's equal in fight scenes but surpasses it in natural humour.
If you want to experience another great HK movie that's in a modern setting and not a period piece try Tsui Hark's Time and Tide. Not as action orientated but with great characters and slightly more realistic sequences.",1003622400,3,1438,4.450757575757576
891313,5,6304496788,"If you like the high-flying Shaolin style of Kung Fu flick, this film's for you. You'll marvel at Woo-ping Yuen's directorial sensitivity in extracting the nuance's of the genre in both the fight scenes and the plot. And of course, Woo-ping Yuen's martial arts choreography can't be beat. There are some truly beautifully scenes, focusing on things like classic brushwork and a Cantonese stir fry. The characters manage to express themselves through their faces and gestures, which makes up for what came through the translation as rather cartoonish dialog. True to the genre, the background scenes provide just enough motivation to make you cheer for the good guy in the fight scenes -- no more, no less.
Plotwise, you get the masked good guy defending the peasants against a foolish and corrupt local court, a Northern outsider who blows into town and proves to be a Kung-Fu butt-kicker, a child of said kicker of butts who's being schooled in the Shaolin arts himself and provides a strong focus for everyone's affections (and though it's not apparent in the movie, apparently becomes a legend in his own right), the Florence-Nightingale-like love interest -- who mixes it up with the boys and holds her own, a few fistfuls of corrupt Shaolin monks, an ugly virgin who is both the butt of jokes and kicks some serious butt herself, a sprinkling of nasty imperial guards and a buffoon-like local constable who shows his heart and goodness in the end.
The main departure from the genre is that there is no bad guy focus other than a corrupt system of imperial government.  The embodiment of that government only makes himself known as the flesh and blood bad guy in the final third of the movie. His menace seems to lie mostly in his beard and nasty looks, but he turns out to have a few tricks up his sleeve (pun intended, but you've got to see the film). And in what may be a first, it takes two good guys to take out this bad guy. They accomplish this in one of the more spectacular fight scenes ever filmed -- all on poles reminiscent of a pier that's lost its boardwalk.
The fight scenes seem to emphasize balance and mystical stance names over pure force. The women hold their own, and each warrior stops to comment on the skills of the other, with nods to their techiques, along the lines of ""ah, the peasant sweeping the street"", ""ooh, he controls the angry chambermaid"", ""wu goes to market"", and so forth. The boy's litany of positions during one scene is almost magical. Poison, fire, pole-arms, tricks, darts, traps, nets, and every other martial arts accoutrement gets its time in the sun, the moonlight, or candlelight.

It was obvious everyone would try to compare this movie to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Which was also quite a wonderful film). This movie stands in a light of it's own and needs no comparison as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon doesn't either. They are both quite different. Some features are quite nostalgic to me, reminding of the 70's era, namely the fight scenes that took place while balancing on the heads of other fighters, and the appearance of the ninja figure which has been gone for quite some time and I miss very much. The ninja was a widely used character back in the days of yore, and it is good to see they still lurk in the shadows. The plot of this movie is funny, exciting, action packed, and throws some history into it with a little feminine touch. (However, the girls in this movie offer the sort of feminine touch you might not like... very painful). The shaolin monk was quite a wonderful attribute, and I must say that Yu Rong-guang (Dr. Yang)and Donnie Yen (Wong Kei-ying)are phenomenally gifted fighters.

891318,5,6304496788,"""Iron Monkey"" was originally released in 1993, but North American audiences are only now getting an opportunity to see the film on our big screens.  This new version was released partly due to the enthusiasm of one Quentin Tarantino, and its script, which is loaded with deliciously corny dialogue, shows evidence of his taste or, quite possibly, his fingerprints (one such example has Young Wong Fei-Hung running into a posse of turncoat monks, whom he insulting calls ""Shaolin Punks"").  But don't get me wrong; this is no ""Pulp Fiction"" rip-off.
The obvious comparison is to Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", which is an admitted homage to this (and others from the Wong Fei-Hung series, of which I'm now dying to see more of).  It's a fair comparison for the most part, except that where ""Crouching Tiger"" went for epic grandiosity in its melancholy romantic elements (which I liked well enough in that movie), the ""Monkey""s grandiosity exists only in its intense fight scenes.  That's not to say that the love story element here is not examined, it's just not alluded to as explicitly as it was in the later film.  Dr. Yang and Ms. Orchid's love affair is mysterious but palpable.  It exists only behind the plot, is never fleshed out, but is no less touching.  These two are obviously in love, and care for each other (made especially clear when one or the other gets hurts, and the wounds are dressed with much tenderness).
Still, the obvious thing that will attract people to ""Iron Monkey"" are its Kung Fu battle scenes.  They are, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen put on film.  Now, I don't fancy myself a connoisseur of fight scenes; most bore me to tears with their unrealistic cartoon violence and lack of imagination.  Here, the fight scenes stretch the boundaries of the imagination.  You have to suspend disbelief for a while, otherwise the sight of Shaolin monks floating through the air against the wishes of gravity will be too distracting.  But if you can buy into the film's magic-realist conceit, then I guarantee you will be amazed by what you see.
Director Woo-ping Yuen, best known on these shores for choreographing ""The Matrix"" and the aforementioned ""Crouching Tiger"", gets to put the fight scenes front and centre here, even more so than his late nineties American works.  The man appears to be an endless fountain of unique ideas; there are no dull moments in his fights, and nothing you'll have ever seen before (at least nothing I'd seen before).  The fight scenes are all slightly sped up, and people fly in and out of the frame with quick precision, but they never feel confusing.  The action is easy to follow, and Woo-ping deserves high marks for keeping things palatable and energetic.  The highlight, of course, is the final showdown atop the burning poles.  It is suspenseful, beautiful, dangerous, and exhilarating.  A true show-stopping number that leaves you gasping for breath after it's over.  But there are other fantastic moments too: Dr. Yang and Wong Kei-Ying battle atop a rooftop as a crowd of onlookers gasps below; Ms. Orchid defends her turf with economical beauty against four would-be assailants; young Wong Fei-Hung takes on a bruising hulk in a marketplace, armed only with his trusty umbrella.
The last example also further illustrates the depth of the creativity used here.  I suspect it was Woo-ping Yuen who made famous Jackie Chan's propensity for using everyday objects in his battles.  Here, besides the umbrella that figures prominently above, battles are waged with tables, chairs, poles, but also exotic items such as buns bought from a street vendor, a small chain, and in one memorable instance, a shirtsleeve.  That's right, a shirtsleeve!  It is the most menacing weapon here, and has to be seen to be believed.
The film is populated by charismatic, but less than proficient, actors, who are all cast more for their athleticism than their acting technique.  Yu Rong Guang and Donnie Yen, as the heroes Dr. Yang and Wong Kei-Yang, make for a stunning action duo.  The former has Chow Yun Fat's quiet intensity, brooding nature, and awesome skills.  But he also brings a more obvious warmth to the character.  Yen is Yu's equal when it comes to fighting, and he also ably pulls off the darker anti-hero aspects of his character.  Not to mention the affection he has for his young son.  Tsang Sze Man as the son is as precocious as she (that's right, she) needs to be.  But she also skillfully alludes to the legend that is to come for Wong Fei-Hung.  Jean Wang is a dead ringer for Michelle Yeoh, and she more than holds her own in terms of creating an interesting character, who can kick ass if provoked.  The bad guys here are more over-the-top and cartoonish.  They include a money-hungry but ineffectual governor, who at one point loses an eyebrow in an attack(!) and a renegade Shaolin master who also happens to be an emissary from the Emperor.  The latter makes one of the greatest villain entrances I've ever seen.  It's a mad rush of quick energy and destruction, followed by a menacing tableau.  It'll make your eyes pop out with awe.  Contrast this with a beautiful scene in which Dr. Yang and Ms. Orchid float around a room, collecting papers swept away by the wind, and you get a fine picture as the versatility of Woo-ping Yuen's vision.
If you go in to ""Iron Monkey"" expecting another lyrical love story with action elements, a la ""Crouching Tiger"" you might be disappointed.  Or pleasantly surprised, for the film you will see is such a primordial rush of energy and combat that you will forget your expectations and have fun on the ride.",1003017600,9,5639,4.799171842650104
891319,5,6304496788,"Just to clear up some issues about the film:  It is enjoying a USA theatrical release currently, but the film itself was released originally in 1993.  Stands on its own as one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made, yet was obviously slated for a USA release by Miramax to capitalize on the surprise success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  The two films bear little similarity, with IM being more of an action-on-display film, CTHD being more of a pensive highbrow affair, though both are tremendous films.
Donnie Yen got top billing in the film, yet he is NOT Iron Monkey, he is Wong Fei-Hung's father.  Incidentally, the role of Wong Fei-Hung's father was played by Hong Kong veteran actor Ti Lung in Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (dubbed Legend of Drunken Master in its USA theatrical release.)  Yu Rong-Guang (a former male model in China) plays Iron Monkey, but gets 3rd billing in the film, due to previous unsuccessful efforts at making him a top-shelf HK action hero.
Yuen Woo-Ping's world-reknowned fight choreography truly shines in the ending scene, which has our heroes battling on top of a courtyard of burning poles.  For certain one of the finest martial arts scenes ever filmed.  The Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-Hung is also featured in over 200+ films, including  Jet Li's famous Once Upon A Time In China series.  Wong Fei-Hung was indeed a real person, born in 1847, and passed away in 1924. He was a martial arts master, teacher, healer, and revolutionary who would protect and help those who were weak and defenseless.

We've had this movie on VHS (and now on DVD) for years, and it's great to see that someone in Hollywood finally figured out that it was a hidden gem that deserved a proper theatrical release (just like they did with Jackie Chan's Drunken Master).

My friend had an overseas connection, and we watched lots of Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, and Donnie Yen movies before they became popular over here.  Of course, we couldn't understand a word of them, but we enjoyed the action sequences nonetheless.
Then, earlier this year while I was renting as many HK action flicks as I could on DVD :) I found a copy of Iron Monkey as a DVD rental, and watched it again with subtitles. I was very pleased to find that I was able to follow the story pretty well (unlike alot of cheesy HK action flicks).  So, not only did it have great action, but it had a great plot as well.
Now, thanks to the popularity of Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix, CTHD), Iron Monkey is coming to theaters, and I'm definitely interested in seeing it on the big screen.  That will complete some sort of odd Iron Monkey trifecta for me, I guess. heh
I just hope that Yuen Wo Ping doesn't start turning out really cheesy American flicks like Jackie Chan did after his success (Ok, Rush Hour was good, but what was up with Shanghai Noon?). Or like Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, John Woo, or like Wo Ping's brother has done with Charlie's Angels 2000.

The characters can be a bit cartooney, the performances are over the top, and the stories, well... a bit foreign. But once you get past this, you'll be hard pressed to find films with more breath-taking action and excitement. One of the crown jewels of Hong Kong Action Films is Iron Monkey, directed by Woo-ping Yuen, who also did all the action choreography for The Matrix.
Originally released in 1993, Buena Vista has gone back and completely restored Iron Monkey with fantastic results. The print of the re-release has deep rich colors and very little imperfections (only a few shots look as if the color timing is a little off). In addition to restoring the picture, they've refined the audio including an update to the score. The end result is an Iron Monkey which is on par with current Hollywood theatrical releases. Before seeing Iron Monkey I read a lot of concern from DVD Talk Members in The DVD Talk Forum about the re-release being dubbed. I'm happy to report that it ISN'T dubbed! Iron Monkey is presented in its original Cantonese audio with really excellent new subtitles.
But the reason to see Iron Monkey isn't for its great picture and sound. Iron Monkey has some of the best martial arts action you'll see on film. If you liked the action and swordplay of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or enjoy the action of stars like Jackie Chan or Jet Li, do yourself a favor and see Iron Monkey. It's a complex Kung-fu joy ride from beginning to end! [Geoffrey Kleinman, DVDTalk.com]",1002758400,3,1576,4.734545454545454

My boyfriend and I bought this DVD from a store because it was fairly expensive for a DVD and it HAD to be good.  Yes, a silly reason, but we were NOT disappointed.
The martial arts in this film was really entertaining.  The stunts were incredible and I enjoyed the ""Robin Hood"" plot.  I suggest people see/buy Iron Monkey.  Crouching Tiger, it ain't and if you keep an open mind, you'll be happy about that.

891397,3,6304496788,"Yuen Woo-Ping...sound familiar? It should. He has choreographed fight scenes in ""The Matrix,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and ""Fist Of Legend."" Well, he took a crack at directing his own movie in 1993 (pre-Matrix and pre-Crouching Tiger) and it's was called ""Iron Monkey 2"" even though it was hardly a sequel to the 1977 original. Well, we in good ol' America are just now getting this movie, except ours is called ""Iron Monkey."" It must sound like a funny title to us, but the Iron Monkey is basically a Chinese version of Robin Hood. You know, ""Steal from the rich and give to the poor"" type of stuff. Except this Robin Hood knows some pretty funky Kung-Fu, which is what makes this movie awesome. The fight scenes are some of the best ever made. Sure, it's fake because these guys just fly off the ground, but you have to let your mind past all the and just watch how beautiful the fight sequences are. The plot, a bit lame. The dubbing in this viewing I must admit is cruddy and probably the most negative thing about the movie, besides the lame boss. If you want to see a non-dub version, buy the DVD from Hong-Kong. If you don't like to read, I guess the U.S. version will do. See it if you are a die hard Kung-Fu flying action fan!

I don't own iron monkey becuase you can easily rent it from any video rental store in your area. But i have seen Iron monkey over 5 times. Now that Iron Monkey is being released in North America many are going to compare this naturally to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. But they are different, if you want to see a crazy wire assisted kung fu flick with less plot and more action well this is the movie for you. But if you want an epic like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, when fighting is secondary then you might not like this one. Also this movie goes back to the roots of Kung Fu with classic fist like the Shaolin Wonder palm, and many other Shaolin and wu shu associated fights. Donnie Yen proves in this movie that Martial Arts doesnt only have to be about Jackie Chan And Jet Li, and this might be the breakout movie for Donnie Yen who is choreagraphing the fights for Wesly Snipes in blade 2.",998784000,8,988,4.232804232804233

891400,4,6304496788,"""Iron Monkey"", starring Donnie Yen, is one of the most impressive kung-fu movies ever. It features various kung-fu styles, mostly focusing on Shaolin Temple's style, though.
The fact that ""Iron Monkey"" is about legendary Wong Fei Hung when he was a child is reason enough to buy it. The most impressive aspect of the movie, of course, is its amazing kung-fu sequences, which are far higher than that of ""Matrix."" ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Matrix"" may be compared, for Yuen Woo Ping was the kung-fu choreographer for both. The only difference is that Donnie Yen, who acts as Wong Fei Hung's father, Wong Kei Ying, actually knows martial arts.
The most impressive scene is the last one. ""Iron Monkey""'s last scene has never failed to open the jaws of the audience at its last scene. Many kung-fu movies, the next kick is very predictable, but ""Iron Monkey"" is not one of them. Unpredictable, and hot with fire.

It's got a cool story that borrows a little from Robin Hood. Of course the martial arts is super tight and the crazy aerials are fun to watch. Especially the roof top fight between The Iron Monkey and the boys father who must fight the Iron Monkey to save his son. That was great.

891475,5,6304496788,"I saw this movie for the first time about 5 years ago.  It was lent to me buy a friend of mine whose parents had recently rented it from an asian movie store.  The movie was spoken in Chinese, I'm not sure which dialect, but it didn't really make a difference since I'm not chinese.  Needless to say, I didn't understand anything, because it didn't have any subtitles.  However, that didn't matter.  For the first time I watched a movie that I didn't understand, and quite frankly didn't care to understand, the kung-fu prowess of the actors in this film were astounding.  Infact, I've seen a lot of kung fu films, and I've been involved in martial arts for 12 years, but the scenes in this movie remained burned in my memory.
Just recently I purchased the movie on DVD, it now has english subtitles and an english audio track (the subtitles are better), and the movie is even more enjoyable than the first time.  My brother and I watched it together, and man, we were blown away.  The story is exciting, it's a robin hood-ninja type thing with a huge twist. I know that may not sound too enticing, but believe me, this is one bad movie!  Infact, it's my favorite kung-fu movie of all time, let alone one my top 5 movies of all time.  The directing was good, the story was good (not the average story of a kung fu flick, nothing to do with a teachers death, etc), and the martial arts were magnificent.  You should pay attention to the two women, well, one is actually a little girl playing the role of a boy (Wong Fei Hung)...but she got that role because she is just that good.  And the other woman, man, she's bad.  Watch when she fights the 4 crooked monks, you'll be flabbergasted to say the least. Oh, she's good looking too.
The fight choreography in this movie was fantastic.  There were a lot of fights, and they were all explosive.  Donnie Yen plays the father of Wong Fei Hung, and its his job to...I won't spoil anything.  Let's just say that there are some awesome martial arts involved. To put it simply, the fight scenes in this movie are a sight for sore eyes.  Can we all say ""No Shadow Kick""?
Listen, I'm avoiding too much commentary on the movie, because I want you to see it.  It's honestly a great movie, you should watch it, you won't be disappointed.  You go buy it, if you don't like it I'll give you your money back....hahahaha, no, that was a joke, I'm not giving any money to anyone, but go see it.  One of the best you'll see.

The character of young Wong Fei Hong had a much larger role in this film than I'd expected -- large enough that this could justly be called a prequel for Once Upon a Time in China.  It's great fun to hear the ""Wong Fei Hong"" music in this context.  Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu steal the show, however, as two very different men whose shared moral compass brings them together to fight corruption and evil.  The backstory of the Shaolin monk and his cohorts wasn't developed at all (at least not in this movie), but the plot is otherwise engaging and well-balanced.  And the choreography is among Yuen Wo Ping's very best, including some extravagant and groundbreaking wire work.
If you're a fan of the genre, this one should be in your collection.  If not, Iron Monkey could be a great introduction to some of the best that HK action cinema has to offer.",991440000,,1089,4.553846153846154

In terms of bang for buck, no other martial arts movie comes even close to capturing the savage ballet exhibited in Iron Monkey. Other reviews will tell you about the simple story line, and how it is mostly a Chinese variation of the Robin Hood story. This review is just to reiterate the sheer number of incredibly high quality action sequences. Highlights of this amazing martial arts film rank high in the top CHK fight sequences of all time. From hand to hand battles, to weapons kata, including swords, chains, staves and even an umbrella, the choreography by Yuen Wo Ping is brilliant, and the speed of the battles is mind-blowing. The production values (lighting, photography, etc.) are pure Tsui Hark.. absolutely beautiful.
If you're a serious martial arts film enthusiast and do not have this movie in your personal library, you should be hit with flying sleeves, the king kong palm, and no shadow kicked in the groin all at the same time.

In my opinion, this is director Yuen Woo-Ping's finest work, the creativity level is so advanced, I can't think of any U.S. action films to even compare it to.
It's a brilliant film with simple storyline, interesting characters and played by an unforgettable cast. Here, Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen), father to a younger Wong Fei-Hong, is blackmailed by corrupt officials into capturing the Iron Monkey-a masked Hero who steals from the rich and gives to the poor (played by Yu Rong Guong).

There are some laugh-out-loud moments, and there are a lot of those, but amazingly this does not ruin the movies drama (excellent story line) or it's action in the least, it makes it better. This movie is sort of like robin hood only way back when. A hooded fighter in a ninja outfit steals from corrupt rulers tog ive back to people who really need it. He scales the rooftops using all kinds of cool gadgets. Also, he runsinto some very intresting people along the way.

The second point is the fighting choreography. The fight sequences are wild and powerful. You just have to see the last fight scene on the burning poles to understand what I mean.
As for the quality of the DVD, I will say that it is decent. It is not as great as some DVDs that are published by big american companies, but it's enjoyable. The english subtitles aren't quite accurate at times, but they're not confusing.
It is a movie to own and is (mostly) a great prologue to the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series.",976406400,3,741,4.537313432835821

The film displays intense, satisfying action throughout.  Having said that, kung fu films relying on fantastical acrobatics and pervasive wire effects are an acquired taste, and I haven't quite fully acquired that taste.  Also, in a few fight scenes, the film has been ""speeded up"" ever so slightly, for effect... (to a purist- a no-no!) I will say that compared to other wired films, the use of these ever-present wire effects in this film is measured and tasteful, and not over-the-top.
