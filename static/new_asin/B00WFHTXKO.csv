8713105,1,B00WFHTXKO,"Yuck...sorry, but I was hoping for now of a parody horror film, this is more of a sexually gratuitous home video oddly made and mainly do that the director/actor could have sex with various women and tape it for ""movie"" purposes... I love stupid, camp, bad...but this id's beyond because it was honestly just a shotty done porno flick. I can't even... If I want to watch amateur porn; it'd be done better than this!",1446681600,2,415,4.546666666666667
8713106,2,B00WFHTXKO,After leaving a scathing review last night after watching this I slept on it and woke this morning thinking maybe I was a bit harsh. I still don't think it's a great movie though. I am a huge Tina Krause fan and that is the main reason I bought this dvd but my god she should never have signed up for this quite frankly. I'm 48 years old now so obviously not down with the hip kids with this whole 'fappening' thing but this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever until I woke up this morning. The delivery of the film is very amateur and could have been much better with a bigger budget and a lead actor who can actually act. It was great to see Tina and Rachel Robbins though.,1446595200,2,680,4.159090909090909
8713107,4,B00WFHTXKO,"Finally a bad Bill Cosby rape joke in a 2015 horror film. This movie is definitely a sign of the times. A sad satire on celebrityidis. This has no production value at all but I still enjoyed it. It also has the cheesiest dialogue of all time. Plus a hysterical Human League nod to the song ""Don't You Want Me."" All kinds of hidden and obvious Easter Eggs and inside jokes. A hipsters heavenly paradise of references. The music helps the pacing a bunch for me with lots of unknown rap artists and a hardcore Marilyn Manson metal mix. My wish is a much higher gore score. It is lacking in ANY on screen kills and it really kills the movie. That should be a priority in a movie this exploitive, down and dirty and sleazy. Wait another year and raise $10K and use it just for the kills. It would make this movie an 8 instead of a 6. Tons of hardcore gore with great music, horrendous dialogue, lots of T&A, quick pacing along with a fun underground soundtrack are the ingredients for a cult classic.

This was shot in Brooklyn for zero budget so it has loads of flaws but it's still very interesting and had some relevant social commentary. It will be fun to revisit as a time capsule piece to catch a glimpse of 2015 Americano culture and I look forward to seeing more from Sean Weathers.

The Fappening is a portmanteau of fap, which means masturbating to online photos or videos and the word happening.",1445299200,5,1401,4.384615384615385
