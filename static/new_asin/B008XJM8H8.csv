8532174,4,B008XJM8H8,"I bought this mostly for the movie Relentless. William Lustig is a personal favorite director and he doesn't disappoint in a movie that has more in common with Seven than the other films in this collection. It's the sort of crime movie they don't make anymore. It's day light more often than night and yet it still feels sleazier and nastier than the dark and ominous lighting of most modern crime thrillers. Leo Rossi also is almost believable as a detective too. His hair is a little too nice but I could believe him as a middle aged guy just trying to do his job even if things got super wild towards the end. Oh the gun shots in this movie are hilariously bloody. It's a world where a 22 can create a hole in a person like they got shot by an elephant gun.

No Mercy is the other notable movie on this disk. It's a bizarre world where guys walk around New Orleans with flame throwers and Richard Gere is a tough guy. The gun fights are goofy and it's not realistic. It's kinda interesting to watch Richard Gere playing essentially an 80s action hero. The movie isn't too far removed from Cobra with Stallone. No one should ever consider that an insult. The thing that really helps the movie is the weird visuals. It's somewhere between Long Hot Summer, Steven Segal, and a military thriller. It does this while being supposedly a cop vs mob movie.",1470268800,,1351,4.42570281124498

8532182,3,B008XJM8H8,"This trio of movies was OK to me because of their diversity. ""Scenes of the Crime"" is a tight drama based on a true event. Jeff Bridges stars as a kidnapped crime boss held by a would-be criminal in way over his head. This one has more twists than a snake and keeps you guessing will Bridges convince his captor to free him or not. There are a couple of jokers in the deck: the kidnap victim's partner, another ruthless criminal wanting to move in, the wanna-Be's girlfriend and a locker key to a fortune in the mix. ""No Mercy"" stars Richard Gere as a cop after the killers of his partner and Kim Basinger as an uneducated Louisiana back-country girl and the property of the villain. The plot runs from a brutal murder in Chicago to a chase through the swamps of the delta and the showdown where no one escapes unscathed. ""Relentless"" stars Judd Nelson. His portrayal as a quietly sadistic serial killer is both fascinating and unnerving. Robert Loggia as the apathetic veteran LA cop and Leo Rossi as the brassy rookie from New York are the yin and yang of officialdom pursuing the killer. If you like your thrillers gritty, scary and tough you'll sit spellbound through it. ""Where Sleeping Dogs Lie"" stars Dylan McDermott, Sharon Stone and Tom Sizemore. This is the strangest yet understated performance I have ever seen Sizemore turn in. McDermott is a homeless failing writer who takes up residence as a real estate salesman in a mansion with a violent history. Sizemore rents a room in the mansion and slowly draws McDermott slowly into the realization of what the mind of a murderer is like. The writer researched the unsolved murders in the mansion and becomes Sizemore's terrified co-author and virtual prisoner. Stone portrays the writer's agent and lover when he was in the chips. This is a chilling horror story but without zombies or vampires.",1372204800,2,1855,4.71076923076923
