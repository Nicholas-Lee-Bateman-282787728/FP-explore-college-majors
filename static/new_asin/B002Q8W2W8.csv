3966522,5,B002Q8W2W8,Funny and entertaining and in a good clean way.  Kids can enjoy it as well.  Not that they will get everything but teenagers can.,1261958400,,129,4.333333333333333
3966523,5,B002Q8W2W8,I throughly enjoyed Thou Shalt Laugh 4 - excellent comedy for the entire family. John McCormick [...].,1259539200,,102,5.0588235294117645
3966524,5,B002Q8W2W8,I really enjoyed this comedy DVD. It's good clean fun. It's safe to watch with the kiddos. No foul language or questionable content. Be sure to check out the first 3 DVD's in the series too. Great stuff. It's so nice to have something to watch that's geared towards Christians. Kind of hard to find in this day and age.,1257292800,3,319,4.333333333333333
3966525,5,B002Q8W2W8,"This is the first version of TSL I've had the pleasure of watching and it delivers! I was not familiar with most of the comedians, so it was a pleasure to be introduced to them. John Tesh does a great job of holding things together and his 'bits' are pretty funny, but the real work comes from the individual comedians. Each has his own style and they are varied enough to hold your interest and all are funny in their own right. Taylor Mason shows how incredibly diverse a talent he is, going from stand-up to ventriloquism to piano. Isaac Witty's Bible Map bit is very funny and Michael Jr's bit on 'overly Christians' is very funny. However, I think the funniest performer on the DVD is Dana Daniels. I've seen Dana in the past and in my opinion is one of the funniest comedians in the business. As you might guess by the title and cover, this is a Christian-based show and as a result, there are several references to Christianity, but it also means that you can show it to any group without worrying that the language or content will offend. I highly recommend this video.",1257120000,6,1077,4.444444444444445
3966526,5,B002Q8W2W8,"I had the distinct pleasure of seeing an advance copy of THOU SHALT LAUGH 4 that was sent to Christian retailers all over the country.  Let me tell you - it's the best one yet.  From beginning to end, the comedians are dazzling. Normally on previous TSL's the comedians are hit or miss, but not on #4.  They're all great.

This latest version is hosted by John Tesh.  Tesh, while definitely not a comedian, is a pro and an engaging host who keeps the show moving along nicely.  But on a stand-up comedy DVD, I'm looking for nothing but funny from the comedians.  And on that score, Thou Shalt Laugh 4 delivers in spades.",1254268800,11,620,4.385964912280702
3966527,5,B002Q8W2W8,"I was at the taping for this DVD in Corpus Christi TX They moved some of the comedians around for the DVD, but they are all here. I had just seen two of the comedians, Joe Wong and Isaac Witty, on Letterman a month or two ago. I was interested in if they would change their set much, and this DVD has the best of their Letterman routines plus lots of new material. I love Isaac Witty's delivery - he makes you laugh even when he is not talking! Wong has an unusual style - kind of like Steven Wright - long pauses where he spends time looking at the audience after a joke. Rex Havens had great observational humor with unbelievably funny segments about weddings. Taylor Mason was funny as usual - but his bit on the piano with John Tesh was classic. Michael Jr. was the most overtly Christian of all the comedians. But his descriptions of ""oversaved"" and ""creepy"" Christians was funny and uncomfortably too close for comfort. Finally, the funniest for me was Dana Daniels. I had seen some of his clips on You Tube the last couple of years and I was looking forward to his set. He didn't disappoint! His set seems to have a lot of improv as he keeps the same performance structure as the You Tube clips - the same but completely different as he reacts to his co-star, Luigi the parrot and audience members. He was worth the price of admission himself.

All this is held together professionally by John Tesh, who is humorous but his main job is get the real comedians on and off.

Overall, this is the best DVD in the series. While the rest of the series had some real highlights, this entire DVD is consistently drop on your knees hilarious. Thou Shalt Laugh #3 was a little edgier (some in my group think too much so), but this is funnier and ""cleaner"". I can't think of a better gift for yourself or any family member.",1254096000,14,1819,4.347058823529411

3966534,4,B002Q8W2W8,"Watched this as soon as i got it (long time ago). Anyway, it's clean, funny comedy everyone in the family can enjoy. I really did enjoy it. Not very long sessions but i thought each of the comedians were good. Personally, i liked them.",1303344000,,235,4.363636363636363
3966535,4,B002Q8W2W8,"One caution; one segment by Michael Jr. is definitely not family-friendly. The rest are safe for everyone.  One of the comedians is a ventriloquist, another does some magic as part of his act.  A good variety and lots of laughs.  One routine about how men have two colors of shoes and women have dozens, which he recites quickly, is hilarious.",1280534400,,343,4.683333333333334
3966536,2,B002Q8W2W8,"I'm not prude, but I've often wondered who wrote the law that says a comic MUST use profanity.

I thought this might be a nice chnage of pace - and it was.  It proved that comics do NOT have to use profanity, but it begs the question ""Can comics not use profanity AND be truly funny?  Well, not in the release, anyway.  It's okay, certainly isn't ""bad"", but it won't bring tears of joy to your eyes, either.

Next time I'm looking for good clean fun, I guess I'll have to dust off Bill Cosby's ""Himself"".  I hope the VCR still works...",1277337600,,535,4.196078431372549
3966537,5,B002Q8W2W8,"I was a little iffy about this DVD, given that I'm not exactly in their target demographic. But I found the material to be surprisingly funny, despite the family-friendly nature.

It's definitely not for everyone, but would be a great video to have running if you've got a family friendly business operation or something to that effect.",1274832000,2,336,4.894736842105263
3966538,2,B002Q8W2W8,"Since this DVD was considered Christian comedy and family friendly, I asked a neighbor and her mother if they would watch this with me (I always find comedy funnier with company). My neighbors are church goers and sensitive to profanity or any racy content, especially the 90-yo mother.

Just about the only good thing I can say about this DVD is that it IS, in fact, profanity-free and pretty safe for the family. The problem is, the family may not want to watch more than 10 minutes of it because it is just NOT funny. John Tesh is charming as the host, but he should not have tried to be funny. Painful!

I used to go to The Improv on a regular basis, so I have seen a lot of comedians in my time. The comedians on this DVD, though all male, were quite a diverse bunch otherwise (an African American, a Chinese American, a puppeteer, a (fake) magician, etc..). The one thing they all had in common is that they weren't funny. Sure, some were funnier than others. Some were more experienced than others.

Seeing that 50 of the reviewers of this DVD gave it 4- and 5-star reviews and raved about what drop-to-your-knees, gut-busting hilarity ensues, I thought it would be an enjoyable way to spend time with my neighbors. Instead, it was awkward. The elderly mother complained about every comic (until I finally turned it off) and the daughter tried her best to laugh to be polite...but finally, we all agreed that the funny wasn't happening and turned off the DVD. We watched the entire performance of the first 3 comedians and then parts of one or two more. After they left, I watched parts of the rest so that I could say I'd at least given each comic a try.

I do not recommend this DVD unless you have low expectations.",1272758400,,1725,4.466666666666667
3966539,3,B002Q8W2W8,"This provides a mix of comedians.  Some were humorous.  Some were more lame than funny or humorous.  The comedians are all suitable for the entire family, so you can feel confident in watching it with your kids.",1272240000,3,211,4.648648648648648
3966540,2,B002Q8W2W8,"Having never heard of or seen any previous versions, I did not know what to expect but was intrigued by the thought of stand up comedy that did not use profanity and crudeness to get a cheap laugh.  While this definitely fit the bill for most of those things, it came up really short on comedy.  I now know why the title is what it is - you are being commanded to laugh even if it is not funny.  I found it to be rather bland and boring, and not even worthy of a cheap rental.",1272153600,,476,3.9375
3966541,5,B002Q8W2W8,"My husband and I love great comedy.  There is NOTHING like having a ""good laugh""!!!!

Unfortunately, much of the comedy out there (that's actually funny) is definitely more rated ""R"" than ""PG"".  We have honestly grown tired of crass and ""over the top"" humor that borders on offensive.  Thou Shalt Laugh 4 was such a welcome change of pace for us.

It's really funny....something that I was afraid ""Christian humor"" couldn't pull off.  The comedians talk of everyday life stuff.  Family dynamics, male/female dynamics, and many of other relatable topics.  We enjoyed every minute and I don't hesitate to recommend it!",1271635200,4,616,5.02970297029703
3966542,4,B002Q8W2W8,"I was a little leery about chosing this DVD thinking it would be a little too mild to be funny. But I actually found myself laughing at most of the comedians (most of whom I had never seen before). I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of dirty talking, nasty comedians and is looking for an alternative entertainment format. I loved this, will definitely be looking into prior releases to purchase for my collection.",1270080000,,425,4.605263157894737
3966543,4,B002Q8W2W8,"There is an obvious emphasis on being unoffensive, even ""Christian"" (culturally Christian, like the I have a Christian dog, Christian cat, and Christian lawn, nothing to do with doctrine kind of Christian) in these routines. I have to admit, I am immediately skeptical of any of these Christian-trying-to-emulate-something-the-world-does kinds of products. Nevertheless, my wife and I definitely laughed and thoroughly enjoyed most of this dvd.

The magician was poor, but the rest of the routines were funny, some (Joe Wong in particular) were even incredibly memorable. I could definitely see us watching this again in the future. That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise.",1269907200,2,679,5.40566037735849
3966544,3,B002Q8W2W8,"This is the christian media world trying to be hip, part 6000. John Tesch hosts a string of decent comedians as they try to marry stand up comedy with the Word. I'd say it works most of the time, and gets about as far as Donny and Marie in the wink-wink department. If you want harmless christian humor that doesn't preach, and actually DOES manage to make you smile a bit, this is it. I guess.",1269475200,,394,4.197368421052632
3966545,3,B002Q8W2W8,"I often wonder how other people think. I know a guy who complained that Soupy Sales was too obscene for him to stand. (Soupy Sales. On TV. In the 1960s. Seriously.) I guess everyone has their line in the sand. I know where mine is, and I guess it would seem weird to someone else.

Every time I watch ""Christian comedians"" I feel like they're more about not crossing their own line than about being funny. That's not to say they can't get off some good lines, but I feel there's a certain uneasiness that gets in the way of the hilarity.

The comedians on this disc are a mixed bag of good and not so good. If your first concern is not offending God or your mother, then you will probably find this disc more acceptable than I.

But it probably wouldn't hurt John Tesh to take some emceeing lessons from Tom Bergeron.",1269475200,,817,4.292207792207792

3966547,5,B002Q8W2W8,"When I decided to get this DVD I was a bit apprehensive since I hadn't seen any of the others in the series and it is billed as Christian comedy.

The fact of the matter is it is easy to suck doing comedy and doing clean comedy seems to be very difficult - witness the tiny sliver of standup that you'd be comfortable watching with your grandmother. Right? Even fairly clean comedians have some very tasteless parts of their acts. It is frustrating if you'd like to share it/them with someone close with a similar sense of humor but the bad part(s) always drown out the very funny stuff before or after.

So, thinking of Sinbad's special from a few years ago -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sinbad-Son-of-A-Preacher-Man/dp/B001Q7OASY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sinbad: Son of A Preacher Man</a>&nbsp;- I went ahead and got this one.

Really, very enjoyable! Not everyone was knockdown funny but all were good for some laughs and a few were funny all the way through. Joe Wong in particular was great and his type, or sense maybe, of comedy was dead on for me.

Good clean humor. Even, for this venue, some risqu stuff from one guy which kind of stuck out to me because it made me wonder how far it could go considering the Christian label. It didn't go far. Perhaps I expected the worst :p

I was surprised to see John Tesh hosting but I never have kept up with him since he left ET so long ago. I knew he has had a successful career playing the piano. He did a great job of course since he has entertained huge audiences for many years he was very comfortable on the stage. He wasn't terrifically funny but he did give you an urge to see the next person in the line up. haha.

3966548,3,B002Q8W2W8,"This DVD contains six standup routines with introductions by John Tesh. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this DVD. I have never seen any of the previous installments of ""Thou Shalt Laugh,"" and while I was inserting the disc, I was preparing myself for ninety minutes of cringing. However, I actually found all six comedians fairly humorous, and a couple I thought were exceedingly funny. Since my expectations were so low, I was pleasantly surprised.

This DVD is marketed as ""Christian comedy,"" but only two of the comedians explored Christian themes. Mostly, this DVD is just ""clean"" comedy or what some call ""family friendly."" A couple of the comedians get mildly edgy, discussing race relations and divorce,  but there isn't much that could offend on this DVD.

The DVD has one annoying negative that costs it an extra ""star"" in my opinion. The show is filmed in widescreen, but the DVD is not enhanced for 16:9 televisions. What's the point of that? If you have a 16:9 television, you will watch this DVD with black bars on the top and bottom AND sides of the screen, or you will have to use the zoom function on your TV. Not a big deal but very annoying. For what they are charging for this DVD, you'd think that they could include a standard feature like this.",1269043200,,1273,4.674107142857143
3966549,4,B002Q8W2W8,"Realizing that different people have different opinions on what is funny and what is not, I am rating this DVD as 4 stars for my own sense of humor, which tends to be somewhat wide-ranged from subtle to almost slap-stick.

Three of the six comedians on this DVD really impressed me, especially Rex Havens, the lead-off one.  His bit about car names, men and women, and shoes was hilarious.  Joe Wong, the second presenter, had a few good lines, but his pace was way too slow - something he shared with many of the other comedians.  Dana Daniels, the magician/comedian, was a bit slow-paced, but his interaction with the people he volunteered from the audience was outstanding.  He was very quick with funny comebacks and his overall act was quite entertaining.  Michael Jr. was excellent in spots, but was not consistently funny (to me).  Isaac Witty did not keep my attention, so I'm not sure if that was my fault or his.  The last comedian on the DVD was Taylor Mason, a very talented ventriloquist/pianist with a high energy level who was the perfect choice for closing the show.

Although there were several lines about Christians from a few of the comedians, the humor was not overtly Christian throughout.  My favorite one, Rex Havens, joked about everyday experiences that men and women have and elevated simple observations to hilarious insights.
John Tesh did an outstanding job as MC.  His attempts at humor were well accepted by the audience and even made me smile.

I enjoyed watching the DVD and plan to have it handy so I can view it the next time I need a good laugh.  It will be something I can safely show to friends and family when they visit.",1268870400,,1661,4.647260273972603
3966550,3,B002Q8W2W8,"I haven't seen ""Though Shalt Laugh"" 1-3, but I had high hopes when I popped this DVD into the player. Thou Shalt Laugh 4 does have some genuinely funny, laugh out loud moments. A bit about women's shoes was quite clever. But most of the routines simply offer easy smiles and there are some downright uncomfortable moments. Like the comic who seems to think that extraordinarily long, silent pauses are side-splittingly funny. (They're not.) Most painful is John Tesh, who MCs the whole thing. He comes out at the beginning and says his job is to stay out of the way. Too bad he didn't keep his word. Between bits he tries his hand at comedy. (It doesn't go well.) If you're looking for a comedy DVD that won't offend anyone, Thou Shalt Laugh 4 certainly fits the bill. Just don't expect to be rolling on the floor with laughter.",1268870400,,828,4.526666666666666
3966551,5,B002Q8W2W8,"You KNOW it is a good stand up comedy routine, when everyone in the Family is laughing and there has been no mention of bodily functions, swear words, drugs or acts of procreation!

3966552,4,B002Q8W2W8,"Everyone has heard that laughter is the best medicine.  Proverbs 17:22 (Amplified) says, ""A happy heart is good medicine and a cheerful mind works healing, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.""  I love to laugh.  When I'm feeling sad, I watch the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" comedy series.  I was excited to be able to preview a copy of the latest installment.  My parents were visiting from Tennessee and they watched it along with me.

  It is difficult to find comedy presentations that my parents and I can watch together.  Comedians on the Comedy Channel are often offensive, using vulgar and sexually explicit language.  With the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" series, I feel comfortable watching it with my parents and other relatives and friends.  I don't have to worry about foul language and sexually explicit material.

  ""Thou Shalt Laugh 4"" is on a par with the other installments in the series.  This one is hosted by John Tesh, former host of ""Entertainment Tonight.""  He introduces six comedians in the following order: Rex Havens, Joe Wong, Dana Daniels, Michael Jr., Isaac Witty and Taylor Mason.

  My favorite comedian is Rex Havens.  My family and I laughed non-stop through his entire routine, which consisted of two segments.  In the first, he pokes fun of automobile names.  He once owned a Plymouth Reliant; it made him more reliant on public transportation.  In the second segment, Rex describes how the wedding day is totally for the bride.  She doesn't even want the groom there.

  Joe Wong was hilarious with his immigrant jokes, especially the ones pertaining to his struggles to pass the citizenship test.  For example, one question on the test asked what was Roe versus Wade.  Joe answered that it was two ways for getting into this country.

  Dana Daniels had an adorable parrot whose ""psychic powers"" were uproarious.  Taylor Mason is famous for his ventriloquist dummies.  Isaac Witty is great as a dimwit who is rather slow.  Michael Jr. rolled me over when he recalled how a heckler at one of his performances had asked him why all black men looked alike.  He simply told the heckler that he needed to make the eye holes in his white sheet larger so he could see them more clearly.

  My only complaint with the DVD was the absence of subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.  However, the audio is loud and clear and the video looked great on my high definition television.  Also, the menu enables the viewer to jump from one of their favorite comedians to another.

  ""Thou Shalt Laugh 4"" is highly recommended for Christians and their families who crave clean, wholesome comedy entertainment.  I'm proud to have added it to my collection and can hardly wait for the next installment in this award winning series.  I'm glad to be able to watch it with my parents without feeling embarrassed and ashamed!  Most importantly, I'm glad I can watch it with God without feeling embarrassed and ashamed!

They were hit or miss on the funny..usually 2 to 1 on misses.

This however is consistent in the humour
Clean cut , Christian fun
Some potential Bill Cosbys in the group..seeing the absurd in everdyay things
This is one you can buy and will watch more than once..maybe invite others over for a comedy

All very funny sets, just the right length. This DVD series proves you don't have to swear or be crude to be funny. Very entertaining Family fair, without any of the worries that you can't let your kids watch this with you. I laughed throughout most of the DVD. I was a bit worried that I would not enjoy it, do to its Christian roots, but quickly was relieved to see there was not much religion pumped into it.

All the acts are different and some better than others.

This is something you can watch with the entire family.  And you will find yourself laughing at times.  There is such a cross-section that you won't find everyone to your liking, but it is fun.

The first comedian was funny in his own right (used a lot of one liners) but also used a lot of facial expressions and hand gestures in addition to his humor.  The next comedian was VERY dry but at the same time funny.  He was a little slow at first, but once he got going it was funny.  The next guy was more of a prop comedian and did a great job with it.

I definitely recommend this DVD.  I greatly enjoyed watching.  With that said, these are not shows you would consider headliner comedians.  However, they are quite enjoyable.",1267401600,,647,4.2809917355371905

The comedians on the disc had a broad range of humor styles, which further contributed to the entertainment value of the DVD.  I especially liked the fact that the DVD was ""for Christians, by Christians"".  Thou Shalt Laugh 4 made me laugh out loud quite a few times with jokes that were sometimes silly, sometimes serious and sometimes just plain fun.",1267056000,,628,4.831775700934579
3966560,4,B002Q8W2W8,"I have never watched the other Thou Shalt Laughs but am glad I checked out this one. The comedians all did a great job entertaining the crowd and do not be put off that this is at a church or that it's Christian. It pretty much did not talk about religion and the times it did, it did a good job of making fun of itself while still respecting religion.

It was extremely refreshing to see and hear jokes that are clean. I have gotten very sick of the same swear words and all the jokes about sex, sex, sex. It may be clean comedy but it sure kept us laughing throughout the dvd. It is something I would definitely watch again. The only reason I gave it four stars is because some of the comedians I really did not care for. There were some great jokes but also some who let the joke go flat and you can tell that they're new to this. Still, this is definitely a DVD worth checking out.",1267056000,,885,4.086206896551724
3966561,3,B002Q8W2W8,"I have not watched any of the prior releases of this series, so I cannot judge this compared to the others.

John Tesh is bland and well-meaning and really helped me root for the comedians to come onscreen and put poor old John out of his misery. I am certain that doing stand-up is very difficult and especially so if you have to keep thing clean and also with a (presumably) sober audience. If you are looking for something safe to lighten things up at a church youth group gathering, this may something, just don't get your hopes up for real belly laughs, just some mild amusement. Maybe it was my hearing, or maybe it was the production that did not include much in the way of audience reaction and I think that affected my enjoyment of the show.

Christians gone mild, not wild.",1267056000,,783,4.430555555555555
3966562,3,B002Q8W2W8,"Even thoug nothing will ever beat the first one it was pretty funny. The dissapointment is Taylor Mason, I love him as the puppet man(laugh till I cry) when he just gets on the piano and does whatever he is trying to do, its just not funny. That act is like something you do at a friends and family gathering.",1266624000,,309,4.166666666666667
3966563,5,B002Q8W2W8,I gave this as a gift to a friend who has shared it with all his other friends.  It has very little objectionable materials.  It has great laughs.  I am looking forward to viewing it again and will probably by the earlier editions as well.,1266105600,,239,4.266666666666667

8377608,5,B002Q8W2W8,"Love how this series introduces new comedians to our household.  The production is first rate, as usual.  The comedians (all men in this one) are fabulously funny - side splittingly so!

Glad we have it on DVD, as then we can rewatch favorite segments until we know them as well as the comics do!

Taylor Mason and Michael Jr. give first rate performances.  Joe Wong, new to the series, was incredible.  Rex Havens and Isaac Witty provided new material for my sons to quote to friends.  But by far, Dana Daniels and his parrot act stole this show.  Combining magic and humor in a new twist - funny, funny stuff!",1388793600,,611,4.490909090909091
