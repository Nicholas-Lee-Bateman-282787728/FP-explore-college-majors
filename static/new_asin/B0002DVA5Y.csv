8027033,5,B0002DVA5Y,Lenny Magill does such an awesome job. This DVD is worth every penny. He really breaks it down in to very simple steps. He is well spoken and easy to understand.,1364428800,,161,4.225806451612903
8027034,1,B0002DVA5Y,Unless you have never picked up a weapon in your life you are wasting your time and money on this macho simplistic training video.  I purchased this DVD to learn things about my USP that were not common knowledge.  I did not need or want a sophomoric pistol training DVD that had nothing to do with the H&K USP .40.,1303862400,2,315,4.233333333333333
8027035,5,B0002DVA5Y,"MY NAME IS AARON . I PURCHASED THIS DVD RIGHT AFTER I PURCHASED A HK USP COMPACT 9MM . MY BEST FRIEND HAS THE SAME ONE PLUS THE HK 45 FULL SIZE MODEL . THE DVD BREAKS ALOT OF THINGS DOWN .GUN TOTING TIPS , STANCES , PROPER HOLDING , ETC . EVEN BREAKS IT DOWN IN SLOW MOTION TOO . WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME . BIG PLUS FOR ME WAS THE GUY EVEN SHOWS YOU HOW TO CLEAN YOUR GUN TO . THIS DVD WAS PERFECT WHEN I RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL FROM THE SELLER . AND ALSO PERFECT TO WATCH . I WATCH IT ONCE A WK JUST TO STAY FRESH . GREAT DVD . ALSO ON EXTRA SHOWS ALOT OF OTHER TITLES AS WELL .SO THAT WAS ALSO A BONUS .",1235692800,3,603,3.4411764705882355
8027036,5,B0002DVA5Y,The sections on dry firing and imporving muscle memory are worth the price of the video. Practicing these each day made my range time much more productive - firing both faster and more accurately.,1213833600,3,196,4.794117647058823
8027037,3,B0002DVA5Y,"This is a good video for the beginner, but for someone that has shot guns for a while and is familiar with them, this video has little to offer.  Much less, most of what is talked about is just basic techniques in using a firearm.  This video does not get into details of the HK USP, he just uses one of the models during the video.  He could have been using a Sig, a S&W or a Glock and most of the video would be the same.  I have a full size HK, but Lenny Magill primarily uses the compact, which is a little bit different in design.  I would not recommend for the true gun enthusist.",1040256000,5,586,3.9743589743589745
