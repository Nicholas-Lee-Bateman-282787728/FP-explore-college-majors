8557146,2,B00ARWX1AC,"In Brunello Rondi's ""Prigione di donne"" (""Women's Prison"" from 1974, AKA ""Riot in a Women's Prison"") a French woman in Italy, 'Martine' (Martine Brochard) is wrongly accused of drugs possession and thrown into prison, etc., etc. We already know this story very well, so I don't think I need to elaborate! Let me get right to it, and point-out what are the pros and cons of this DVD release by Full Moon Pictures.

The Pros:

Yes, the picture quality is very good, and even excellent in some cases. They restored the film as best possible (supposedly, some film-stock was *damaged beyond repair).

Featuring established film actors alongside Euro Cult regulars too: Martine Brochard, Maril&ugrave; Tolo, Erna Schurer, Katia Christine, Cristina Galb&oacute;, Isabelle de Valvert, etc.

The playful/provocative yard scene where 'Susan' (the simply sexy and beautiful Maril&ugrave; Tolo), starts teasing a male guard, was in its entirety, and the picture quality is excellent throughout this scene.

The scene where the young nun (Cristina Galb&oacute;), is attacked and stripped naked, is also in its entirety and in excellent quality.

The Cons:

The strip search of 'Martine' (Martine Brochard) at the opening of the film, is missing a key graphic ""cavity check"" scene (I'll let you figure it out). Why? It's a good thing I still have my old and trusted VHS copy (don't throw them out, just yet).

The shower scene (about 26 mins. into the film) is also missing some key footage. My VHS copy has lengthier FFN shots of the various women in this scene. Again, what happened? (*)

This is a dubbed version (and an atrocious one at that), I would much rather prefer the original Italian language version myself. The running time by Full Moon Pictures is listed as 87 minutes, yet I only clocked 80 (why the discrepancy). My VHS copy has a roughly 94 minutes running time. That's a lot of missing footage!

So there you have it. Because of the key scenes I described and, the fact that there's so much missing footage, I can't give this DVD release of ""Riot in a Women's Prison"" (by Full Moon Pictures), my full backing and approval. I should think and hope that, a complete and uncut version of this film has to exist somewhere. So until then, skip this one. NTSC, English (dubbed), NR 80 mins. (BTW: Brunello Rondi was a long-time associate of Federico Fellini, he even co-wrote ""8 1/2"".)

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1408752000,17,2416,4.868292682926829
8557147,2,B00ARWX1AC,"Another 'Grindhouse' offering from the Full Moon folks - ""Riot In A Woman's Prison"" (unfortunately) demonstrates that not all WIP flix are created equally.  This 70's vintage Italian effort takes a stab at the WIP genre but comes up lacking in precisely the  elements that make these films 'fun' for those that enjoy such twisted drama.  The visual quality of this (English dubbed) DVD is quite good - a nice clear widescreen transfer - which is sorta ironically 'wasted' on the content & imagery presented.

The plot features the well worn basic premise of a young woman wrongly accused of a crime she didn't commit who gets thrown into the slammer with a bunch of hardened criminals.  In this instance it is French tourist 'Martine' who gets inadvertently scooped up in a police raid on a group of Italian hippies and dumped into a women's correctional facility that is run by a gang of Catholic nuns.  Martine is tossed into a cell with, what appears to be, the prison's 4 most attractive inmates - the rest of the incarcerated women all look like 50 year old 'bag ladies'. Whereas THIS may well be closer to the 'reality' of what one might find in a female prison population, it certainly isn't what most guys plunk down their hard earned bucks to see in a WIP flik!... and this is sorta at the heart of 'what's wrong' with this particular film.  At several points in the movie it becomes evident that the director is attempting to 'lift' the genre to some greater artistic or politically relevant level which (of course) is a BIG mistake!

The core ensemble of cellmate/actresses are pretty attractive - one bears a striking resemblance to Liz Taylor in her heyday! - but their 'chemistry' is pretty lack-luster.  Scant nudity is present in the usual scenes: the 'orifice check' - communal shower - etc. but that's about it. Once the director does finally get to some, long awaited, lesbian action he 'artfully' dilutes it by superimposing the images of the naked lovers over scenes of ocean surf crashing on rocks.  Boy - did this guy ever get it 'wrong'!  When the heroine of the piece is finally exonerated and walks free there's a definite 'who cares' feeling to the whole thing.

In the 'bigger picture' - this is another example of the 'hit or miss' syndrome that I've noted in the recent  ""Grindhouse Collection"" releases from the Full Moon outfit.  Some are great ( like 'Caged Women') and some really suck (like this one & 'Savage Island'). Note to Italian WIP directors: 'leave the arty stuff to the likes of Fellini & Pasolini' - Note to potential purchasers of 'Riot In A Woman's Prison"": 'more of a renter than a keeper.""",1386201600,2,2639,4.683982683982684
