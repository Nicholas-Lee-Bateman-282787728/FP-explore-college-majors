4214946,5,B003X2O79W,"I am very happy with this DVD.  I have the book also,  but didn't need it after watching this DVD.  I couldn't learn freestyle swimming before.  I was always out of breath.  After watching this DVD I was able to swim for hour without break. It is amazing.  I couldn't believe myself.  I think it depends individually.  I  never had problems with buoyancy so it was easier for me to learn it fast.  I can swim for hours now.  Now I need waterproof MP3 so I can swim longer.  I am getting bored after long time swimming and need some music to make it more interesting (:
  I really recommended this DVD for everyone who likes to learn freestyle  swimming.  It was a little expensive but is worth it.  I would spend more money on classes somewhere.",1309478400,26,745,4.321167883211679

4214948,4,B003X2O79W,"I purchased this dvd after being fed up with relying on pull buoys, flippers, and wetsuit pants.  I've done over 18 triathlons, including 2- 1/2 ironmans but was not happy with my swim efforts.  Started doing the drills from the dvd, but felt I needed feedback on what I was doing.  Attended a TI workshop near my home, and after 2 days could not believe the results!  After 3 weeks of drilling (2x a week) in my local pool, I am just astounded @ the difference in my swimming.  No more struggling--just so easy.  I actually enjoy going to the pool, and I don't have to bring any kind of props like buoys, flippers, etc.  Just Me!  I know this is going to be so extremely helpful in any tri I do, especially longer ones--no wasted movement--saves you for the bike/run legs!  Highly, highly recommend TI, especially if you can attend a workshop.",1303516800,19,844,4.4640522875816995

4214950,5,B003X2O79W,Step by step instructions easy to follow and easy to tell the difference as to what you're feeling when applying. I would recommend to look at it over and over in order to develop muscle memory. If you have an immersion coach also it would probably take you less time to develop the skills but all in all I love the dvd.,1301529600,12,320,4.17741935483871
4214951,5,B003X2O79W,"I could not swim freestyle and as a new year resolution, I decided to learn this skill. I ordered this DVD at the end of January, and after a little over a month, I am able to swim across 25 yard pool in 18-19 strokes. I feel I am gliding through water with ease.  I am a 5 foot 5 middle aged female and not athletic at all, so if I can learn, everybody can.

I watched every lesson carefully and took notes. Then I memorized it and practiced in the pool. I just finished the final lesson, which is two beat kick. It took me several trips to the pool to finally got it.  This DVD is not shot using endless pool, and is very clear. Terry did a great job demonstrating movements.",1299715200,60,677,4.037313432835821
4214952,5,B003X2O79W,"I got this video because the ideas behind it spoke to my problems.  I'm in pretty good shape, took some traditional swim lessons, then couldn't figure out why I got exhausted after only 50 yards of swimming.  Total Immersion is not only a radically different method of teaching, it's based on a radically different understanding of where the propulsive power of freestyle swimming comes from:  i.e., from the core muscles, rather than the arms and legs.  The exercises in the video are clearly explained and justified, well suited for self-study at your own pace.

I do see one fault with this video:  although it covers all the exercises you need in order to do the freestyle well and with minimumn energy, it does not make clear the difference in some cases between what you do during the drills and what you do when you actually swim.

I would also note that people learn at different paces.  For some, this method immediately ""unlocks"" the secret of effortless, long-distance swimming.  For others (me, for example), the road will be longer and will require more patient drilling, particularly to attain the balance in the water that is the essential prerequisite to swimming effortlessly.

I think any swimmer should be able to benefit from this video, particularly if your learning method is oriented toward patient, focused practice of technique.",1298851200,84,1353,4.973333333333334
4214953,5,B003X2O79W,"I'm simply astonished at the results I've achieved using this program. Learning from a DVD is far better than a book, though still short of in-person instruction. With that said, though, I can't imagine how the DVD could be made any better. I purchased it to help me train for a triathlon. Before I started I would tire after about 75 yards. Using these techniques I very quickly started swimming 600+ yards in 20 minutes without tiring significantly. As I said... astonishing. A fantastic bargain, too.",1298764800,29,503,4.8604651162790695
4214954,5,B003X2O79W,"This DVD captures the essence of learning freestyle.  If you like to learn by seeing, and having simple drills that build onto the next - then you will want to use this DVD.  Even better than the other TI DVD's (my opinion) because the other DVD's did not always clearly explain why you were doing something.  In this DVD there are no demos by novice swimmers to confuse you, but the demos are done by Terry or his expert swimmers.  I highly recommend this DVD, and don't bypass the early lessons even tho you may think you are advanced - because the balance drills set the stage for effortless swimmer.",1297728000,39,603,4.454545454545454

Within two weeks I was swimming 30 minutes at a time without struggle. Now it's the end of January, and this evening I swam 1.25 miles with only a few stops, without struggle or fatigue.

We practiced one or two lessons each time at the pool,  We are not all the way finished with the DVD, but really enjoying our new found freedom since learning how to skate/stroke.

Overall the approach makes sense.  The demo footage is excellent.  No you are not going to go fast, but that isn't what this method is about.  It's about finding a way to get comfortable in the water and have the ability for some distance.  I would say it has absolutely helped me get relaxed and focus on not simply getting to the end of the pool - but focusing on my form.  I have been working on learning how to swim for over two years and I bring this out every other month and review a section and typically pick something up that I didn't see or ""get"" the previous time(s).  So it a process and a continual review.  Watch it and if you feel overwhelmed - then stop - go to the pool and practice.  Come back - watch it again - leave it for a week or so - keep practicing and over time it will feel less mechanical and more natural.  It will evolve - at least it has for me.",1423699200,5,1050,4.0

I tried another DVD first and then group swim lessons but was not progressing very much.  I felt discouraged, uncomfortable in the water, and quickly fatigued. I struggled to swim 50 m.  A friend told me about this DVD. I first got it from my local library and then ended up buying it. I had major breakthroughs after Lesson 3 and then again at Lesson 6. I can swim continuously for at least 20 minutes, easily swimming 600+ m.  One of the things that is helpful is that the camera shows so much of what is going on under the water, so I could get a better idea of what I was supposed to be doing.

4215029,5,B003X2O79W,So I am new to swimming.  I started in Feb of this year and I started for health reasons.  From Feb through May I struggled to swim more than 4 laps (25 yard lap pool).  After practicing the exercises in this video I have been able to swim much further and with less strain than ever before.

4215052,4,B003X2O79W,"I did the TI program over the past two winters during my triathlon off-season, and incorporated the techniques into my training. I was a decent swimmer (former lifeguard and WSI, etc) but never competitive. TI got me over a lot of hurdles so I could be more competitive in tri swimming: level position, streamlined body, core rotation, and of course, the two-beat kick which then forms an easy foundation for a four-beat kick. I am much more controlled as a swimmer due to TI.

But there was a threshold I just couldn't cross with the TI technique. As I transition this fall from Ironman distance training back into short distances, I am setting goals for speed, which I don't feel is a strength of the TI program. I took some time off after Ironman and have gotten back in the pool recently, and now am adopting Sheila Taormina's Swim Speed Secrets and already I've knocked 10% off my 100 splits. She contradicts some of the TI methods including extension, rotation, and turnover (actually a difference in what is meant in each program by front-quadrant swimming), but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

Get TI if you need to build a foundation for yourself - you'll focus on swimming in a way you never have before and it will become more enjoyable and efficient. But when you need to ramp up the speed, you'll need to draw on something else and change some of the things you're doing; but you'll be starting from the right place.",1382572800,11,1441,4.5813953488372094

I would watch the lessons, take notes on what to do, and then go to the pool and follow my notes. I did half my training in a lap pool and half in our pool at home. I felt more confident with the drills when others weren't around so i progressed much faster at home. Initially, I wasn't really sure of the purpose of some lessons and wondered how it correlated to teaching me the freestyle. However, after a certain point it clicked and I am grateful for the step-by-step guidance.  Some lessons took me two tries to master and some are longer than others.

When I decided to try my first sprint Triathlon, I needed to start swimming. yuck!!!  I really struggled and a friend said to try
one of the Total Immersion CD's. That has been some of the greatest advise I have received.

4215065,5,B003X2O79W,I started training for triathlons recently and when I got to the point where I had to start the swim training I VERY quickly found out that I didn't know how to swim for distance.  This video is a great 10 step guide to get you on your way to swimming efficiently for long distances.  It starts with very basic movements and then builds upon them to get to the full swim technique.  Should be very easy for just about anybody to use these lessons to develop a great swim technique.,1359331200,,481,4.263736263736264

I wish it had a workbook with it (and there may be one sold separately) because I had to take extensive notes so that I could reference them while I was at the pool.  If you are looking for a way to be a distance swimmer without killing yourself, this is the technique for you.  Terry Laughlin is not only a great swimmer but a great teacher too.  I love his laid back, relaxed teaching style.  If you look on Youtube he has a 10-series lecture that explains the science behind his techniques and works well with the video.

This book explained swimming efficiency so well, that without even finishing it or using its drills- simply implementing it's theory, I went from being winded after 50 yards to completing 1500 yard swims in about two weeks- as the cardio ability is already there, the form needs to be fixed.",1358121600,2,510,4.655555555555556

I own an older DVD ""Four Strokes Made Easy"", that I think might be better for someone new to TI because it is more detailed on stroke techniques and drills. I bought this newer DVD because I had noticed from some of his online clips that he has refined his method since those earlier videos. I feel that he has simplified the technique in the newer material, but I'm not sure it stands on its own.

I have modified my triathlon swim training to include a weekly session devoted strictly to the skills and drills of this method of free-style. My split times have decreased, but perhaps more importantly, I am much less tired at the end of each session. I can now do back-to-back 500 yard repeats with decreasing split times. My long sessions have increased to 1800 to 2000 yards. A huge improvement. My only suggestion is that it should be a two-disc video with more instruction time given to mastering the 2-kick, which will be vital to conquering the longer half-iron man swims I am shooting for.",1335484800,4,755,4.90625
4215072,4,B003X2O79W,I really am impressed with the Total Immersion series.  It's very good for self teaching and also improves swimming where it is enjoyable instead of a struggle.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and effort using this video.  This particular video doesn't have music in the background and it makes the lessons less appealing.  I enjoyed seeing different people swimming and the music in the Freestle:Made Easy better.,1332979200,2,418,5.0144927536231885
4215083,4,B003X2O79W,"I bought it about 2 months ago, for me free-style became a completely different experience: the freestyle can be that smooth and effortless, now I'm eager to swim! I go to the pool 3 - 4 times every week, those instructions help me improve different parts of the stroke. If I can further improve my breath, I feel I'm able to swim a few miles without a stop. I used to stop to breath every few laps.

There are several key concepts the author should emphasize

wide track : this is critical not only to reducing cross over and streamlined body, but also weight shifting and breath. Staying on the wide track, I feel like a bullet train. It took me several weeks to realize the importance of the wide track, the author does mention the wide track a few times in the DVD, but that seems not enough

weight shifting : I used to kick prematurely - before the leading arm fully pierces into the water. A good timing kick is the second biggest contributor to my stroke.

Unfortunately such great techniques and methodology are negated by poor presentation and organization of the content. It's just boring and dry. The author should hire a professional to work on the cosmetic issues. Even a few slides before each chapter would make a big difference",1332201600,15,1244,4.540178571428571

4215086,1,B003X2O79W,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised?  Does the value justify the cost?  Does it improve my life?  I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.

RECOMMENDATION

I do not recommend this product.  I'm an open water swimmer and triathlete, though I mostly train in indoor pools.  I love the total immersion technique, and Laughlin has serious open water credibility, but the DVD fell far short of the quality I found on the shorter, denser clips on YouTube of Laughlin's onsite coaching sessions.

FUNCTIONALITY

The instruction offered on this DVD is almost nonexistent.  You're far better off searching youtube for some of the videos on actual technique and drills.

VALUE

This product is not at all worth your money.

DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?

No.  To the contrary, it made me angry.",1326499200,51,845,4.811188811188811
4215087,4,B003X2O79W,"I started using this video six weeks ago to learn how to swim freestyle.  The lessons are well organized into a progressive learning approach.  Some lessons are intuitive while others are not.  For those that were not, it took re-watching the lesson and trial and error in the pool to finally get it.

When I started the lessons my 100 meter pace was 3:30.  Now it is 2:15.  I think my freesyle has improved in terms of speed, but I'm still working on the ease and fatigue part, which is an underlying principal of the program.

The last lesson on two beat kick synchronization was not intuitive to me, but I finally got it after five weeks. It is in my opinion critical to learn this in order to get maximum strength from your core and maximum body length/reach.  It was a break through moment when I finally got it.",1324512000,9,817,4.4
4215088,5,B003X2O79W,"I read the book, but was having a little bit of difficulty fully completing the transition from my old swim style to the TI methods. The DVDs were an irreplaceable tool when it came to visualizing and fully understanding the form and body cues.

His back is sunburned, hairy and blubbery.  And he swims like an old man who has trouble moving.  So disgusting, I couldn't bear to spend more than five minutes before stopping the DVD.

4215090,5,B003X2O79W,"A couple of decades ago I was part of a high level masters swimming course for several months. We swam a few thousand meters a day but received very little stroke instruction. Most of the participants didn't need any. I didn't have a swimming background and did. In the last year I started swimming again at a pool frequented by people who know how to swim. I thus became reacquainted with what a student of the Total Immersion approach to swimming calls ""terminal mediocrity."" I swam a lot of meters, intervals, etc., but improved very little in terms of speed. I stumbled on the Total Immersion program as taught in this DVD and it has been a revelation. The program breaks the mechanics of swimming down into bite sized pieces and then slowly integrates them. The drills are explained with precision and demonstrated clearly. (One reviewer criticized Terry Laughlin's ""portly"" appearance. Mr. Lauglin is the creator, narrator, and demonstrator of the Total Immersion program. He is a long time swimming coach and still swims long distance races, including the 28.5 mile Manhattan Island swimming marathon. He knows and clearly demonstrates what he is talking about.) Working through the drills on my own, my swimming has significantly improved in a month, and I now understand why I swam so inefficiently before. Be advised that you have to seriously practice the drills. What was learned incorrectly can't be undone simply by watching a video, and the timing and coordination of the fundamental elements of the freestyle stroke require constant practice by even the best swimmers. But if you, like me, have struggled with terminal swimming mediocrity and are wondering what you need to do to really improve, this is the DVD for you.",1315526400,34,1736,4.969072164948454

As familiarity is achieved, pauses are eliminated, eventually leading to comfortable whole stroking.  There is no substitute for attending a TI workshop with a certified instructor, but this DVD is the next best thing.  Also serves as great refresher material for those who have attended a workshop.
