5125879,5,B0083TUE7E,This movie was a refreshing departure from the ordinary. Where so many movies are about the dark side of life. This shows you that if you trust in God even in the most desperate of situations He will see you through.,1348531200,,216,4.2926829268292686
5125880,5,B0083TUE7E,"I just received ""I Am Gabriel"" from Amazon.  One of the best movies I've come
across, ever.  Acting was good, story line - not predictable.  This movie should
have received three or more OSCARS.  I've told several friends about this movie.
They are wanting to borrow my copy.  I told 'em all to go ahead and buy their own,
cause after viewing mine, they will want their own copy anyways.  This movie is
about a town that has lost ""Hope, Faith, and their Trust in GOD"".  When an unlikely
Angel comes to town, things begin to turn around.  And who could not like this
Gabriel character.  With old and new faces alike, a great film to watch, get it.",1348444800,10,646,4.361344537815126
5125881,5,B0083TUE7E,I was so touched by this movie it reminded me that there is a God and he is there for us.  All we have to do is talk to him and he will answer.,1347753600,,143,3.2058823529411766
5125882,5,B0083TUE7E,"I cannot praise this film enough and have bought copies for friends.  I will also use it in Bible Studies that I help coordinate.  While there is a great cast, especially Dean Cain and John Schneider, the one who stands out for me is the lovely young Jenn Gotzon.  This is a young lady I believe is destined to be an Academy Award and Emmy winner.",1347494400,,347,4.2272727272727275
5125883,5,B0083TUE7E,"How can you turn away the words of a child? And yet this town does to its own detriment. Beautiful message that is skillfully played out in this powerful story. I love it when an underlying lesson isn't forced, but allows you to come to your own conclusions and apply it in your own life. Great work and cannot wait for another!",1346889600,,328,4.306451612903226
5125884,5,B0083TUE7E,This movie is a great reminder to all Christians to talk daily to God. It is also an affirmation of His goodness and His desire to bless us. It opens with 2 Chronicles 7:14. That is a message all of America needs.,1346544000,37,213,4.095238095238095
5125885,4,B0083TUE7E,"Whenever I watch movies I'm not sure what to think. It's not my normal go-to genre to watch drama as I'm more of an action and adventure with big special effects type of movie watcher. However this one is worthy. When it comes to Christian films there seems to be a big line with some being overly cheesy and some being really quite good. This one was really pretty good in an unbelievable way. What I mean is that here we have Gabriel, as in the angel Gabriel that comes to a town on the edge of failure and hopelessness with a message and a gift from God. It is not something you see every day and this was not a big budget film, but it was well done. The scenes were real and in small town life rather easy to see and imagine, no matter how unbelievable our minds think miracles may be.

I knew going in that I would probably be a fan as I have enjoyed many things from Mike Norris over the year, even if they do usually have action, this was more a drama - well definitely a drama. That and being the Superman fan that I am I have always liked Dean Cain and Jonathan Schneider. There were many unknown-to-me names in this film, but overall I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind looking at Echo Light again for more films. All of the previews were enticing as well. It's about time we have more family friendly with wonderful messages to fill our TV screens.

God has a message for you and he wants to hear from you.

5125886,4,B0083TUE7E,"Echolight Studios brings to life an interpretation of the God-sent archangel, Gabriel. Mentioned in the Old Testament, Gabriel spoke to Daniel and again his presence was shown in the New Testament as the bearer of the ""Good News"" to Zechariah, his barren wife Elizabeth and the virgin Mary. The angel announces himself to them as ""I am Gabriel"" and so, he follows suit in his introduction to Promise, Texas.

This larger-than-life angelic being is sent to earth to the town of Promise, Texas - a town whose hope is gone. The loss of a baby triggers a series of events in the town that spur the question, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""

Gabe appears out of nowhere with nothing but the clothes on his back and his prayer mat. Taken in by the family who'd lost their baby years earlier, they simply trust in the presence of this child. Gabe reignites the desire to talk with the Father, the God of all, and reminds the people of Promise, God loves them and hears them when they come before Him with a sincere prayer. Miracles begin to happen as Gabe sees into the hearts of those who've grown bitter through their brokenness and as a result, healing begins.

Though the movie ties it's ending up with a bow, it is successful to touch your heart and remind the Christian of the importance of an intimate relationship with Christ. For the non-believer...I Am Gabriel may seem a little unbelievable by assuming even unbelievers understand what an intimate relationship and prayer life with God is.  Even so, there are very touching moments in the movie which convicts us of our failure to ""just talk to God. We're stirred to once again hope...and we know, hope is the beginning.

I Am Gabriel, is laced with ex-Superman, Dean Cain and also, Smallville's John Scheidner. Overall, a good movie that left me convicted in my heart. - Cindy Sproles, ChristianDevotions.us Editor",1345420800,94,1880,4.719512195121951

5125898,3,B0083TUE7E,"If it wasn't for the actor who plays Gabriel, this would be just another one of the countless cheesy Christian movies that make atheists sneer, Agnostics smile indulgently, and many Christians cringe. But thanks to Gabriel - and the premise, which I believe is quite believable and very accurately reflects how angels never leave God's presence even while working tirelessly to help save us from ourselves - I kept watching and was riveted until the end. The acting was so lackluster, it was almost good, in the sense that I felt I was watching the real people from a real town who who really experienced it. And there were moments when the cheesiness was so over the top, it actually came across as tongue and cheek and I laughed instead of cringed. Again, because of the actor who portrayed Gabriel, even the climax did not flop miserably. If you are going to use CGI at the moment of truth, PLEASE invest the money to make it work, otherwise leave it out. Hallmark-style visions do more harm than good, IMO. And then there were the prayer mats... and prayer leading to material abundance... it introduces a weird materialistic Buddhist cult touch that is really not Scriptural. A Christian doesn't need a prayer mat to pray, especially one made out of loud colors and faux-silk. I can talk to God anywhere all the time, and if I want to kneel, I'll go to church or just use a cushion or a pillow. I cannot honestly recommend this movie but Gabriel is worth experiencing.",1521936000,,1473,4.647509578544061

5125943,1,B0083TUE7E,"Absolutely horrible. I'll start by saying that's it's not biblical, or sound. What your see on the DVD box cover is ""Gabriel"" looking down on the church members as most of them bow down at ""his glory"" ABSOLUTELY WRONG. Bible clearly states, ""You must not do that"" It happened to Peter and then John bowed down to the angels in revelation, and in both cases the angels rebuked John and Peter rebuked the people for the bowing down. You bow to God only. There are other instances where ""Gabriel"" is healing people. God heals! But this movie will eventually covers their tracks. After about ""Gabriel's"" forth healing, he is heard saying, ""God heals"" too little too late and very misleading. Then there is the prayer mats. I think they were trying to start some sort of movement among Christians? Thinking after watching this that people were going to start making these stupid things. I'm a saved Christian for a number of years now, and have seen many saved Christians pray, and I have never seen a mat pulled out, or used. Just get on your knees! As far as the acting goes, it's  just terrible. The story line is even worse. The editing looks like a bunch of 7th graders did it. The ""special effects"" are a joke. The story jumps from one scene to the next without any consistency, or rhyme or reason. Dean Cain is the only actor that most will know, or recognize. His performance is just plain bad. BUT my wife and I stomached through it. After it was over I literally took it out of the DVD player and right into the garbage it went. Do not waste your money on this like I did, for all and more reasons that I mentioned. Spend a couple more dollars and buy ""The Encounter"" this movie is biblically accurate and worth the money. ""I Am Gabriel"" doesn't even deserve one star and should be pulled from Amazon.",1512086400,,1806,4.472727272727273

5126063,5,B0083TUE7E,"Exceeded all my expectations.  I'd thought that because this was a low-budget production from a small studio (rather than a big Hollywood blockbuster), its quality might not be up to par, but oh boy was I wrong!  The acting is superb, the setting is well chosen, and the message is even more effective than I'd hoped.  The boy who plays the title role as the Angel Gabriel, Gavin Casalegno, is not only breathtakingly beautiful but also an amazing actor despite his young age.  The film does feature some well-known actors, too: Directed by Mike Norris (Walker Texas Ranger) and starring John Schneider (Smallville) and Dean Cain (Lois & Clark).  The movie was inspiring for me because while I thought I had problems in my life, the characters in this movie had BIGGER problems, putting my own problems in perspective as minor by comparison.
This movie is proof that low-budget movies (with good actors) can be better than most big Hollywood studio movies.
I'd like to see more movies like this.",1459296000,,995,4.829411764705882

5126066,3,B0083TUE7E,"I'm giving 3 stars because it's a Christian film and I truly appreciate the efforts of the actors involved in this movie for the Gospel of Jesus. I'm a John Schneider fan and I really had high hopes for this. Sadly, it is a movie I regret I purchased and will not watch a second time. I would fast forward to the last 15 minutes of the film with Schneider and Gabe and watch from there. IF those 15 min had been captured throughout the entire movie I'd feel differently. Lack of character development, pointless dialog- just two of the major things going wrong in the film. The actor for Gabriel clearly has a unique look and has potential as an actor- and was honestly the only part of the film I really enjoyed- even though reviews stated he was robotic. I think that kind of speech was intentional as a no-nonsense Gabriel who clearly presented as a BOY but isn't one. My husband couldn't finish it last night, I watched the second half today. Those who wrote/directed- there's potential here, you just didn't CONVICT me, HOLD me- I wasn't INVESTED in any character at all and I so wanted to be! Flywheel, The Encounter- there are small budget Christian films that deliver and I know you tried here. Thank you for spreading the good news.",1458000000,,1241,4.495575221238938

Although there may have been some minor technical incidents, the movie did give ones imagination time to fill in when what happened on the screen did not tell you.

""I Am Gabriel"" is basically about an angel who visits a small town to save it from drowning in faithlessness and economical down turns.

5126311,2,B0083TUE7E,"This movie frequently comes up as a recommendation if you watch certain types of movies or independent movies. After seeing this movie I am convinced Amazon's recomendation engine is broken.  This movie is not for you if it is recommended and you are not a take it on faith and faith alone Christian type. This movie is not nearly as deserving as other reviews.

The director does a poor job leading the actors which come across as stiff and unnatural. The non-spiritual interactions in the story line are unbelievable. The spiritual arc in the story, pun intended, is adequate but not inspiring. The script forces spiritual realization in just a few minutes of the start of the movie then short circuiting the adventure for the audience. Just 13 minutes into the movie the audience is already prepped for the end testing our patience to stick around for the next hour and 15 minutes whiting for the characters to catch-up. Twenty four minutes into the movie the audience is cheated when the story gets overtly preachy. Think badly scripted pushy commercial.

This feels like a sermon that starts at the end and ends at the end with superficial plot devices in-between. There is no mystery or crisis of faith in the story which misses the whole point of story telling especially when it comes to a religious based story. I would have preferred a classic Bible story or a feel good Christmas story.

The photography is fairly good when actors are not in the screen but as soon as there are people close up, the shot is too close and over framed. I get the feeling I am watching an old TV show cropped at the bottom to create a wide screen or HD movie. Maybe this is an edit or formatting problem for DVD.

This movie is motivated by a good intentions but the cinema value is missing. I respect the work, beliefs and intentions for all those involved in making this movie. I imagine it appeals to a very narrow group of people. It is simply a religious movie with emphases on you shall believe but does not make any case for believing.",1405296000,4,2033,4.574175824175824

5126413,4,B0083TUE7E,"This is a religious based drama, with a little bit of a mystery. The town of Promise is under a curse, and has been for several years. Out of the blue a boy arrives who will not tell the people of the town much about himself, but is plainly special. He knows things that he has no obvious way of knowing, and seems to be able to preform miracles. The reaction of the town's people vary from person to person. He speaks to the people he comes in contact with about prayer and hope, but he gives hints that there is a special reason for which he came to the town at this time and it is not just to encourage them. I realized the true reason for Gabriel's visit to the town long before the end of the movie, but that did not ruin the ending of the movie for me.
Being a religious movie promoting prayer and hope, there is nothing in the movie which would be objectionable for children to see. It has a strong plot and good acting while at the same time is a good clean drama promoting Christian values.",1375660800,8,999,4.128205128205129

  I have also bought other films of this type: Behind the Mask, Courageous, Stand Strong, Soul Surfer, Grace Card, The Encounter, The Shunning, Fire Proof, Rust, The Mighty Macs, and especially To Save A Life.

5126477,2,B0083TUE7E,"I had high hopes for this movie, partly because Dean Cain and John Schneider were in the cast, but after sitting through 20-30 minutes of poor acting from the remaining cast and feeling as if the whole movie was filmed in a small living room, we couldn't take any more and had to stop it.  We watch a lot of Christian movies and while there are some very well-made faith-based movies, there are certainly some well-intentioned but severely lacking in acting and production values movies as well.  Over the past 3-5 years, we have seen a great improvement in this small-but-growing genre, such as Courageous and Fireproof, (written and produced independently by a church in Georgia), and the most recent we've seen, Unconditional.  Well-done, well-acted, faith-based movies are getting noticed by Hollywood, and I hope Christians in the movie business keep moving forward and stay strong in their values because they WILL be supported.  This movie, however, I am sorry to say, needed better writing, better acting (although Cain and Schneider were fine, given the writing constraints), and much better production values.  I hate to see that happen, but maybe they will learn from this and hopefully, do much better next time.",1366675200,7,1224,5.03960396039604

5126502,1,B0083TUE7E,I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailer and reading the reviews. I enjoy Christian themed movies but found I am Gabriel's main problem areas were the lack of character development and dialogue. The young boy playing Gabriel sounded almost robotic with such limited dialogue that it was hard to get a sense of his character. The other character's situations were not I feel adequately developed so I did not feel the interconnection that could have helped this movie. A good idea without a strong screen play.,1364860800,9,525,4.844444444444444

5126508,5,B0083TUE7E,The town that this movie was truly shot in has the same heart and fears that the town of Promise has. I have been fortunate to watch this movie before it was even released to the general public due to the fact that I live in one or the major town that this movie was shot in. The story is heart felt and powerful it is ment to make sure that people understand that god is out there and he is helping this and every day. The other major thing that this movie tries to capture is that there are unspoken angels all around us and we just have to be willing to take their hand and help and support others like they are doing for us.,1363910400,,628,3.952755905511811

I like the plot and love how they show how Christians struggle with sin just as everybody does, and how we also need to pray more. The one thing i've seen wrong with most Christian base movies is the acting.  Even thow there is two known actors in this (Dean Cain & John Scheinder)  The acting is somewhat weak, and that also comes from the main actors as well.  The thing that makes a movie great is believing the characters in the movie.  If they can't relate to the characters their playing it brings the movie down.  I do really like this movie.  I think it would be a great gift to friends or family that don't believe in Jesus as well as those who do.",1363392000,,791,4.157894736842105

I really enjoyed this movie, so yeah 5 stars in my book. If you're looking to renew your faith or just want to feel closer to God; or even just to remind yourself that anything can happen if you just believe (I know this sounds cheesy, but trust me, you'll feel like this after you see this movie), then I highly reccomend this movie.

Very much worth the viewing. I gave it five stars and recommend it to everyone, een non-Christains. It is moving, whether you are a beliver or not.",1360627200,32,476,4.482758620689655
5126547,2,B0083TUE7E,This story had elements that could have made it a great message. The actors were first rate but the premise of a boy angel was beyond belief. The story line was sometimes slow and plodding and it did not flow smoothly. I could not recommend it as worth buying.,1359590400,6,260,4.326530612244898
5126548,5,B0083TUE7E,"We showed it to our 5 and 7 year old grandchildren.  The 7 year old just sat and watched and the 5 year old (boy) rolled on the floor playing most of the time.  Afterward they asked to watch it again because they didn't like it---they loved it.  We watched it the next night with their dad and the 5 year old kept telling him what was happening in the story.  And we didn't think he had been paying attention because he was playing with toys through the whole thing the night before. We watched it for 5 nights in a row because they wanted to and then decided to give it to them.  We could always buy ourselves another one.  I guess we never know, when they're really paying attention. We found out it's good for all ages.  It reminds us what God can do, if we just let him and pray.",1358899200,55,783,4.078431372549019
5126549,4,B0083TUE7E,"This one seems to be a low budget movie.  Still, it was a good movie for Christians and hopefully others.  It's about miracles that happen when you believe and don't lose hope.  Nice message.  It was written. produced and directed by Chuck Norris.",1358812800,,247,4.674418604651163

5126551,4,B0083TUE7E,"As a movie it was fantastic, as a fairy tale it was even better than fantastic. Its got heartfelt drama, teary eyed moments, and some good casting, especially with Gabe and the DOC (JOhn Schnieder). If I was missing 20 or 30 IQ points, didn't have the blessing of being able to think for myself, and could get over the overt silliness of reliogen in general this movie would probably be life altering.. If your a christian, or have any faith in god whatsoever, this movie will melt your heart and send you straight to the prayer pats to solve the problems you face, sadly the following day, the following year, and all the years after the problems will still be there unless you fix them yourselves. So enjoy the movie, but don't take it literally..",1358294400,,749,4.514705882352941
5126552,5,B0083TUE7E,This movie inspired me to look re evaluate my life.  The things that are the most important are over lookes so often.  So often we hope instead of trusting in our creater and praying to Him.  Wish there were 100 more movies like this one,1358121600,,237,4.222222222222222
5126553,5,B0083TUE7E,"I don't want to run on here...but I don't like movies with kids in them. It's a fact.

I almost stopped watching this DVD when I saw how it opened.  I saw the kid for the first time and started reaching for the remote....
BOY!  Am I glad I didn't!!!!!

Once into the movie by just a few minutes, I was hooked, as were all the folks watching it with me.  There were 4 adult males and wives in our group besides me and my wife.  ALL the us men were trying so hard NOT to sob, wipe tears from our eyes or make fools of ourselves in-front of everyone....

You know from the start where this kid comes from but you continue to be amazed on a minute by minute basis.  There is some sort of action happening almost constantly.
This is not a detractor, but it draws you into the kid's mission more and more.  The people who produced this flick knew what they were doing!  The kid actor just couldn't hardly do any better and the two main adult guys acting as a doctor and a cop; Schieder and Cain respectively, were perfect.

The kid actor just had the authority that was needed for his part.  Well done kid!

I wish to add loudly here that this movie is NOT a preachy, soft, pushy, manipulative, gushy, or mabie-pambie type Christian flick!

Ok, so some of the actors weren't absolutely pro, but they did just fine and did not detract from the quality.

Not to ruin the ending, but something happened near the end that for a very few moments seemed a bit corny....but.. within seconds you realize the action was needed to complete the movie.

WOW!!! This was one of the best movies I've seen;  ""Love Dare"" was great, ""Courageous"" was super-duper, ""October Baby"" was greatly super-duper...but this one was right up there!

I know I have used too many exclamation points.... but... see this flick for youself.  You will agree that ""I Am....Gabriel"" is one of the best.

I certify I am NOT related to anyone in or out of this movie.  I have not been paid to make this positive review.  I state that the 10 other adults who viewed this DVD with me will agree with this review.  They are not related to anyone involved with making the movie and were not paid to agree with me....................",1357689600,2,2183,4.362282878411911

This film has a VERY high quality.  The acting is A- to B + level, which for many Religious based films is strong.
The scripting was very good and never seemed to be corny or cookie cutter.

This is the story of a boy who comes down to help save a town.
From a couple, to an old man, to a troubled teen.  In all of them he steps in and helps to reach out to them.

This is Gabriel the Angel coming to help mankind.
Do not look to this film to be a 'biblical' accurate portrayal of the Angel Gabriel.
This is a family film that is good for 8 an up.

Check it out.  You won't be disappointed.",1356912000,,662,3.8955223880597014

5126584,5,B0083TUE7E,"What a joy the movie, I Am Gabriel, was to see. Gavin Casalegno was magnificent, such a talented young man. The story was well thought out to the point that it encouraged a Christ follower and would plant a seed for a non-believer. The key to the movie is that it focused on a personal relationship, conversation with God anytime and anywhere. This will be a wonderful `sharing' movie to lend; give or have dear saved & unsaved friends/family over for a movie night. Thank you for a beautiful movie!",1353283200,,499,4.555555555555555

5126586,3,B0083TUE7E,"This is new territory for me but I thought it would be interesting and helpful to review some faith based films. Special thanks a. larry ross communications for the opportunity to review  I Am. . .Gabriel and providing a copy of the movie.

What originally drew me to watch the movie was the cast. I've always appreciated John Schneider's work (Smallville, etc.) and have always been a fan of Dean Cain (Lois & Clark). The film was directed by Mike Norris and does a pretty good job of telling a universal story. As God's creatures we long to see the presence of God at work in our lives, especially when things are rough. I Am. . .Gabriel shoots out the gate with a very intense first scene and sets the stage for this ""withering"" town. From then on though the movie slows to a pace that would be great for a book but tends to drag a bit for a movie. The characters are good though at times the acting is stilted.

Faith based films are definitely improving and I see that trend even in I Am. . .Gabriel. The story makes it worth watching and overlooking some of its less than stellar aspects. And it's a good family movie for sure. I can see children enjoying this film as long as Mom and Dad are aware that it does deal with some difficult areas pretty openly (death, suicide), so older kids perhaps. One of my favorite parts of the story is the message that ""Gabe"" brings with his prayer mat that God just wants us to talk to Him. So true!

Theologically, I'm sure there could be some arguments, but again, the premise of the story and the message of God's love is really what shines through in this movie. And I so appreciate actors like Schneider and Cain who step out of the Hollywood glitz to give their talents for the kingdom of God.

I Am. . .Gabriel is sure to inspire you!",1352505600,18,1785,4.316417910447761
5126587,4,B0083TUE7E,"The message was great, but the special effects, some of the acting and the sound were a little corny. If you're a fan of Walker Texas Ranger you'll know what I'm talking about.",1351296000,,176,4.363636363636363
5126588,3,B0083TUE7E,"If you are looking for a nice religious movie for a family night, this one is a good one to use. It does involve death and looks at addictions, so some people may not wish their younger children to watch it. I enjoyed the movie, but the acting was second rate. It's not a best seller, but the idea behind it was nice. I would recommend for pre-teens and above. It did get a little cheesy near the end, but the ending worked well enough to overlook that small part.",1351209600,,464,4.166666666666667

This is a very positive and uplifting movie--a great family movie!  The message of hope is so much needed today.  My granddaughter wanted to get one of those prayer mats. ""I am Gabriel"" is not just a great, positive movie; but it is truthful.  If we got on our knees before God for America like the people of Promise did, what God did for them, He will do for America.  Its message is very true.  I have shared this movie with several friends and they loved it too.  I highly recommend this movie!",1350345600,,656,4.078125

You'll get choked up at several points in the story, then when Gabriel cries out to God, there won't be a dry eye in the house. In the end, it's uplifting. Just what we need now.",1350086400,,431,4.5256410256410255

If you're expecting an A-list performance, you will be somewhat disappointed.  Knowing it was a mostly unknown cast I wasn't expecting academy award winning performances.  That having been said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and will watch again.

In the hustle and bustle of today's world, I (we) tend to put God on a ""back-burner"".  Watching this movie reminded me that I need to keep God in a more prominent place in my life, no matter how ""busy"" or ""complicated"" it may become.",1350086400,5,600,4.6761904761904765

5126619,5,B0083TUE7E,"I received this dvd 3 days ago and have watched it each evening after work.  This is an amazing movie.  Even though you know who Gabe is, the ending is great.  I was curious as to why John Schneider knew who Gabe was until the near end of the movie.  Then I realized his faith led him to know.  If you never buy another movie, please get this one.  Some times it may seem a little out of reach, but the lessons learned are something that we can never forget.  I didn't expect the reaction from the sheriff at the beginning of the movie.  My only problem with the end is that we are supposed to believe with faith alone.  The truly sad part of the movie is John Schneider's role.  A doctor whose faith can see him through anything.  It is a wonderful movie and I think everyone should see it at least once.  I don't want to give the ending away, so buy the dvd and look for ""revival""",1348790400,9,882,4.093567251461988
