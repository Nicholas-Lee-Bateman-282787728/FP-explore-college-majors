4208096,5,B003V5CTDC,"Education meets entertainment with perfection. Not just for history lovers. Dramatization as good as any Roman Era films, fine military and Brit commoner costuming, and realistic period settings. As a visual documentary, it is one of the best at filming wild, rustic, natural British countryside you can find on DVD. It's about the Roman Empire's invasion (AD 43), Brit retaliation, and occupation results over 400 years. Eventually the Romans in Britannia fall.
Original UK air, July, 2010.

Presenter/narrator Bettany Hughes is scholarly AND expressive, photogenic,& dramatically theatrical with a most bonny British accent. Her eyes draw you into narrated history as emotionally as the battle scenes. Flirtatious, smiles & looks, rivaling Honeysuckle Weeks of 'FOYLE'S WAR', almost drives one to distraction. I want to be taught more by this historian & will look for ""When the Moors Ruled in Europe"" and ""The Minotaur's Island.""

3 episodes about 46 minutes each--WITH SUBTITLES
1 ONSLAUGHT--Spring AD 43, Claudius sends 40,000 troops to conquer Britannia and perhaps save himself & his public image. Plautius was the general leading the channel crossing invasion of 800+ ships. Romans vs Celts.

2 REVOLT--1st century, 17 year gorilla war (a Viet Nam for the Roman Empire) continued, lead by Boudica and her E. Anglia clan, Iceni (AD 60). She wipes roman colony Colchester off the earth, now archeologically proven. London & St. Albans followed. But tides turned. Rome builds towns, i.e. Bath. A 73 mile Hadrian Wall (AD 130) is Rome's northern wall of dominance.

3 DOMINION--350 years of Roman domination proved a mixed existence for Brits. 10-15% lived well. 85% in harshness, hatred & fear. 10% of Rome's military were stationed in Britannia to exploit. Romans taught the Brits how to tax (ask Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin). Brits became mine & urban slaves. By the end of the 4th century the Romans sun was setting.

Bonus material:
Text Bios of Bettany Hughes, Claudius, Plautius, Caratacus, Boudicca, Hadrian.
Athena booklet with time line, study questions, & 5 essays on historical fact.
Extended Interviews (subtitled):
1 Dr. Paul Sealy; + Mosaics of Romano Britain
2 Dr. John Davies; + Ruins of Romano Britain
3 Guy de la Bedoyere; + Museum of London's Roman Relics

A must for Educational institutions dealing with British history or Roman Empire impacts. Not rated but family friendly, but the intellectual level is high school through adult.
Really wonderful to view--high recommendation for ANYONE who enjoys learning.",1281484800,27,2544,5.300248138957817
4208097,5,B003V5CTDC,"""The Roman Invasion of Britain"" is a really enjoyable presentation.  I had read in one of the reviews that somebody thought the DVD quality was lacking in some way.  But, I didn't find anything wrong with the DVD quality.

Hughes is terrific in her story telling of the Ancient Roman presence in Britain--from the initial invasion until the last Roman Legions left due to crumbling events elsewhere in the empire; the effect Ancient Rome had on the population, their magnificent modifications of the landscape (Hadrian's Wall, Bath, etc.) that was offset by Rome's arrogance and contempt towards a conquered people.  It is a very well done documentary.  I highly recommend it.",1362268800,,676,5.054054054054054
4208098,5,B003V5CTDC,"Strangely this excellent show has alot of bad reviews due to sound problems. As in they can't hear 'brittany hughes'  in the mix very well. Personally the sound was great imo. You can hear brittany quite well throughout the whole three well made episodes. Mrs. H always makes incredibly well done historical shows too, They have battle reinactments and the eps move fast. you get alot of information but it's really entertaining! and of course scholoraly too. History is a bloody affair and not boring in the least when you really look at like brittany does in this show. I do think that ep 3 overstates the badness of living under roman rule. After all what came after was really bad for the british people for hundreds of years. In fact , I would say that most people in the roman empire felt they were better off there than outside of it, at least for most of it's existance. Just look at america today and you can see a elite that is trying to pay no taxes and making life harder for those under them. Removing public works from their lives and sliding backward into a libertarian nightmare! This dvd is well worth watching though and it's very entertaining. The picture and SOUND are fine , I think some people need hearing aids and are in denial probaly. Watch this one it's very well done. And check out mrs. h's other dvd's too. Top notch high grade tv here to be sure.",1314403200,4,1377,4.464285714285714
4208099,1,B003V5CTDC,"I'm a big fan of Bettany Hughes and have all of her other DVDs, so when I saw this video advertized on Amazon I ordered it immediately. Playing it, though, was a huge disappointment. Her narration is all but drowned out by the background sound effects, making the program unwatchable.

Sad to say, if you're looking for something to do that's informative and entertaining, bang yourself in the side of your head with a slice of lemon wrapped around a brick - it'll be more satisfying than trying to watch the 'Roman Invasion of Britain.'",1304726400,4,537,4.652631578947369
4208100,2,B003V5CTDC,"I looked forward to watching this potentially excellent documentary of a period I have always been interested in.  The narrator is a very knoledgeable professor, Bettany Hughes.

However, the experience was ruined by the lack of, or totally bad, editing of the sound! I think I missed about half of the narrative of each episode.

I believe that the producers of this documentary  should re-edit this DVD and give everyone who made the mistake of buying it, a new copy with proper sound editing!",1303257600,7,495,4.857142857142857
4208101,1,B003V5CTDC,"My husband and I were really disapointed with this DVD.  Our expectations were much higher.  We are big fans of Ms. Hughes, and we have all her other DVD's.  The audio was so terrible that you really can't hear her narrative.  We do not like reading subtitles, which is an option with this DVD.  The reinactments were so bad we could tell some of them were wearing Pendleton shirts.  She must have asked for volunteers.  Compared to the great quality of her previous DVD's, this was a real joke.  I can't believe she put this out.  She must need money?  Please, Ms. Hughes, you are better than this pathetic attempt!!!!",1297296000,8,619,4.545454545454546
4208102,1,B003V5CTDC,"More information was provided in the 10 page insert that accompanied the DVD than was presented on the DVD itself.  Many scenes seem to repeat themselves with the same actors, which did not follow the narrative.  The audio was also unsatisfactory, especially the voice of the lead narrator, while the others were only marginal - difficult to understand.",1294012800,5,353,5.068965517241379
4208103,2,B003V5CTDC,"As previous respondent said the audio made a hash of what was to be an otherwise interesting documentary. This is the same also for Michael Wood's India which also had very poor audio. Recommended for English history buff's only, who would sit through the garbled transmission.",1293494400,,277,5.043478260869565
4208104,2,B003V5CTDC,"I've always been a big fan of Mrs. Hughes work. She is always insightful and very thorough as well as entertaining. And did I mention that she's a total babe? This 3 episode collection bears her usual stamp of excellence in it's fascinating subject matter (the Roman occupation of Britain) and her walk along that 400 year timeline. There is unfortunatley one major drawback (to my copy at least). The audio mix is awful. Her voice overs are often unintelligable due to a hot mix of backround sounds that all in all, sound ""flanged"". I mean, her narration is really the entire point of watching these studies. It is full of wonderful images of the English countryside and the surprising # of Roman ruins it contains. The reenactments are bearable and the inclusion of a subtitle option saves the day. But it's hard to believe that someone at Acorn productions heard this audio and said ""OK fellas, let's go with this version"". I certainly can't imagine it passing Bettany's muster. Despite this major flaw, it's still great Hughes; an engaging look at a fascinating topic that helped to shape the ancient world and thus our own. 5 star territory with a 1 star audio. Seems a shame...",1292025600,18,1183,4.719806763285024
4208105,5,B003V5CTDC,"Having seen Ms Hughes previous films (The Spartans, Helen of Troy, Athens) I figured that you could not go wrong and I was right. Considering that this area of history could be a very dry and boring subject. I found instead that the Producers and Ms. Hghes did an admirable job. I especially like the part of the Iceni Rebellion and the Roman crushing of that Rebellion. I just wish the film could of covered a little bit more on what happened to the Colony after when the Legions left the Island. But you can not have everything.",1288051200,4,530,4.418367346938775
4208106,4,B003V5CTDC,"This DVD release came at a perfect time for me since I had begun teaching the very history - in a Latin course - that the series presents.  Unfortunately, the sound level of trooping legions and battle scenes often overwhelms the information that Ms. Hughes so enthusiastically communicates - or, should I say, tries to communicate.  The sound is also plagued by a rather constant distortion that suggests an unshielded microphone in a stiff wind.  For these reasons I have found it necessary to use subtitles while viewing so that my students and I do not miss valuable information.

I have used several other historical DVDs presented by Bettany Hughes: Athens, The Spartans, Helen of Troy on PBS Home Video and Minotaur's Island and When the Moors Ruled in Europe on Acorn Media.  None of these presented the sound issue, so I assume that the problem has to do with a change in editing at Acorn Media (Athena).

Finally, an inconvenience for me as a teacher is the fact that the 12-page viewer's guide was missing in my copy.",1287705600,13,1028,4.715083798882682

8406412,4,B003V5CTDC,"One of my pet peeves with almost all films these day is the background music or noise drowning out the audio but my copy did not have that problem as some others experienced even though I did still run the subtitles.

This presentation was well done, standard Hughes work. However this documentary is very heavy on re-enactments far exceeding that in her other offerings likely because, as a few others have mentioned, there's really not a lot of stuff to show in the way of structures and major artifacts. And some of these re-enactments are shown more than once as if their re-enactment budget was limited. For those who are not big fans of re-enactments, and I'm one, take note.

Virtually every historical point or aspect of this history is passed through rather quickly, never dwelling on much detail, due to trying to cover 400+ years in a comparatively short documentary tweet. But the producers and Hughes make the best use of their time, hit all the key highlights and move right along making good periodic use of commentary by guest historians and archeologists which really adds to the understanding of the topic. Hughes herself does her usual wonderful muted-dramatic voice inflections and visual tics to make points and emphasize key moments. I especially admire Hughes' challenge of the Roman record about a legion killing all the druids and burning their sacred groves on the Isle of Mona (Angelsey). I agree with her interpretation.

This documentary is divided into three episodes with multiple chapters within each. It's probable each episode could have been a separate documentary as in Invasion, Rule and Departure in the form of a series by offering more detail and showing more actual artifacts. One thing I did learn as a historian is how brutal the local Roman big cheeses were but I also felt less strongly than this program portrayed about exactly how dominating the Roman's actually were. I always felt the real extent of any Roman control in Britain usually didn't exceed much further than about 200 yards away from any Roman military fort or settlement, such was the difficulty they had trying to rule those rascal Celts for 400 years.

I'd give this 4.5 stars but couldn't quite reach five because while informative and mostly entertaining it didn't have quite the bling of some of her previous work plus a few minor issues mentioned.",1459900800,,2364,4.9025

8406416,5,B003V5CTDC,I just want to add my two cents about this DVD (which is one of my favorite documentaries EVER).  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the audio at all so ignore the negative reviews and enjoy the program,1388966400,,206,4.421052631578948

8406418,5,B003V5CTDC,"Many reviewers have noted audio problems associated with this DVD.  For this reason, I was reluctant to purchase a copy.  However, having done so, I found no problems with the audio on my copy.  I could hear Bettany Hughes commentary just fine.  Purchased in July, 2013, by the way.  The content was the usual Bettany Hughes stuff - a potted history of the Roman conquest of Britain.  Knew some of it already.  Found the additional historical information interesting.  Unfortunately, there is not much to show, archaeologically, except a few heaps of stones.",1374624000,,558,4.989130434782608
