5991748,3,B00FGK84JS,I really liked this movie.  It's pretty scare but not too bad. I would recommend it for kids who are 6 years old or older.  It's not a top ten Scooby movie but it's pretty good.,1381363200,,177,3.888888888888889

5991750,2,B00FGK84JS,"I have really enjoyed the majority of the 13 spooky tales series.  They put in a brand new cartoon and they have a good mix of the original Scooby Doo, the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, (the unfortunate Scrappy episodes), and the What's New Scooby Doo series.  This one had a ton of Scrappy and a couple of the Mystery, Inc., the new series which is set in recent times and is a very dark version of the show.  I probably should have kept my money.",1399248000,,443,4.127906976744186
5991751,1,B00FGK84JS,"I love Scooby Doo movies and was excited to get a new one.  However, 90% of the 2 disks are with Scrappy Doo.  That is disappointing to say the least.  If you are not a Scrappy Doo fan, pass on this video.",1394668800,3,205,3.8333333333333335
5991752,5,B00FGK84JS,Best thing about 13 spooky tales is they are finally releasing old scooby doo episode from scooby doo and scrappy doo tv seriesthe new scooby doo mysteries which is my favourite shows from scooby doo and some of them with a 22 minute movie which makes this DVD the best and definitely a must have for all scooby doo fans and my favourite thing about this DVD is they released a shaggy and scooby doo get a clue episode the WB hasn't release a new episode from this show after volume 2 back in 2008,1392940800,,497,4.242105263157895
5991753,2,B00FGK84JS,"If you want a hodgepodge of Scooby-Doo episodes, then this DVD set is for you. The very first episode is that of the adolescence gang and not the original meddling teenagers. I do not recommend.",1391385600,,194,4.571428571428571
5991754,1,B00FGK84JS,"I was so excited to purchase this installment of Scooby-Doo: 13 Spooky Tales, For the Love of Snacks. The past installments (all but the very first 13 Spooky Tales) contained a brand new episode of Scooby Doo. I saw the cover and thought it was going to have a new episode dealing with some monster hamburger, only to find this episode is just a pup name scooby-doo but they put Scooby and Shaggy on the cover as grown ups to lead you to think there's a new episode. I am an avid scooby cartoon lover, and already own pretty much all of these episodes other discs or purchased on Amazon instant video or iTunes. I loved the previous 13 Spooky Tales because they had a new episode and quite a few new to dvd episodes.  I have to say this is one of the few scooby-doo dvd's I just didn't care for. I felt this one was slightly misleading.",1390521600,2,836,4.2578616352201255
5991755,4,B00FGK84JS,"Scooby-Doo is back with another collection of great cartoons spanning his 45 year career in crime-solving. ""Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: For the Love of Snack!"" focuses on two of the canine's favorite past times: catching bad guys and finding something good to eat for every occasion. Accompanying him on his adventures and search for the best pizza parlor or hamburger joint is Fred, Wilma, Daphne, Shaggy, and even Scrappy-Doo.

""Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: For the Love of Snack!"" compiles episodes from several of the different series the loveable canine sleuth has been featured in over the years. You can find something from ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You,"" ""What's New, Scooby-Doo?,"" ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,"" and more. No matter what decade Scooby and his gang are found in, they're having a groovy good time unraveling a thrilling mystery.

I only have one major disappointment with ""Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: For the Love of Snack!"" There's no new cartoon included. A couple of the new ""Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales"" DVDs have featured a new episode created specifically for their release. They've been new episodes of ""What's New, Scooby-Doo?"" In my opinion, this adds value to what boils down to a greatest hits compilation of old TV shows. It would help give people more of a reason to pick these up.

Not that anyone would expect it, but there are no special features included for ""Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: For the Love of Snack!"" Children really don't watch bonus material or featurettes anyway. They just want to get right to the meat and potatoes.

""Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: For the Love of Snack!"" will please fans of all ages. The 2-Disc set is perfect if you're looking to throw something in to keep yourself or the kids distracted for a couple of hours. Even though my son has most of the episodes in complete series sets, he still watches this collection for variety.",1389830400,2,1896,4.934169278996865
5991756,3,B00FGK84JS,"This is the 5th Scooby-Doo 13 Spooky Tales themed compilation set of both already-on-DVD and NEW-to-DVD Scooby-Doo episodes to be released. This time the theme is food monsters and snack attacks.

First, the GOOD news. Typically, when they advertise these 13 episode compilation sets, they count the 7 or 11 minute shorts as ONE episode, so you never really get 13 full half hour shows. But, not this time! When counting the 13 episodes, they counted 13 as 13 full half hour shows, including ALL three of the 7 minute shorts that made up one half hour show. They did this for 5 half hour shows, so in this set, you actually get 23 Scooby-Doo adventures in 13 full half-hour shows. Very cool!

Now for the BAD news. There is no 22-minute BRAND-NEW Scooby-Doo adventure, like in the last several 13 Spooky Tales compilation sets. [STRIKE ONE.] Most of these episodes are from the later Scooby-Doo series like ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"", ""What's New, Scooby-Doo?"", ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"", and <ugh> ""Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!"" [STRIKE TWO.] The rest of the episodes are all Scrappy-Doo 7-minute shorts. There's nothing earlier than 1980. So, you can guess what most of the NEW-to-DVD episodes are. [STRIKE THREE.]

So, for those of you who like the numbers, even though they advertise 13 half-hour shows (3 and 2/3 of which are NEW-to-DVD), there's really 23 cartoon adventures (9 of which are NEW-to-DVD). For those of you who are trying to piece-meal together all the remaining Scooby-Doo episodes on DVD, here are the specifics of what's new and what's not (and available elsewhere):

There are no Special Features in this set.

If you are a Scooby-Doo completist, yeah, well then you gotta get this set. But, for everyone else, you are better off to continue waiting for better compilations or possible complete series sets of the remaining series.

Speaking of which, for those remaining Scooby-Doo shows that don't have complete series sets yet, we still have lots of episodes not yet on DVD from:

1972-1973 The New Scooby-Doo Movies Season 1
1973-1974 The New Scooby-Doo Movies Season 2
1977-1978 Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics (The Scooby-Doo Show Season 2)
1979-1980 Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo
1980-1981 The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show Season 1
1981-1982 The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show Season 2
1982-1983 The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour
1983-1984 The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show
1984-1985 The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries
2006-2007 Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! Season 1
2007-2008 Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! Season 2

I wouldn't hold my breath for ""The Rest of The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" as there are still ownership and music copyright issues involved. And no one seems to know how to market a season set for the Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt episodes from ""Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics"". There's also not a lot of demand for ""Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!"" season sets. And all the rest involve Scrappy-Doo, which Warner seems to go out of its way to not even mention him on the already released sets that he does appear in. C'mon Warner, bite the bullet, put Scrappy front and center and see what happens.",1389484800,32,9226,6.625517812758907
5991757,5,B00FGK84JS,"Scooby Doo: 12 Spookey Tales for the Love of Snack is a must have for every Scooby Doo fan! I was obsessed with Scooby when I was a kid and had Scooby slippers and a blanket that I loved to cuddle up in and watch my favorite show. Now I get to share some of the very same episodes with my kids!

My five year old son doesnt show much interest in Scooby Doo because he doesnt care about anything that isn't Star Wars right now. My four year old daughter however is always good to watch Scooby Doo with mommy. She loved it from the first time I showed it to her!

Since there are ghosts and other things that could be scary for little ones, I always watch shows like this with my kids. But I think even at just four she understands that its not real and whenever I ask if shes scared she says no.

This latest collection of episodes cover a wide variety of shows from different times. Since Scooby has been around so long, its fun to see the slight differences and how far television and technology have come since Scooby started.

Scooby Doo 13 Spooky Tales is the perfect addition to my Scooby collection. Its like re-visiting my childhood and sharing it with my own children.",1389139200,4,1176,4.260089686098655
