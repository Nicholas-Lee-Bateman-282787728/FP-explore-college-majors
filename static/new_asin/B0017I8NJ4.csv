3172516,5,B0017I8NJ4,"As the parent of a son who no longer carries the autism diagnosis because we have followed the exact biomedical interventions as the families in this documentary, I am elated that this message of recovery can be passed along to others via this DVD. Thank you, Generation Rescue!",1208217600,11,278,4.8125
3172517,5,B0017I8NJ4,"It's about time that the message of recovery be shared with all who are willing to listen. Autism is no longer considered a lifelong illness. Children are getting better and they are recovering. This movie was beautiful in sharing the stories of families that fought hard for their children and won! They touched my heart and gave me the strength to keep moving even when progress feels slow!

Thank Generation Rescue!",1208131200,9,418,4.887323943661972
3172518,5,B0017I8NJ4,"This film is wonderful.  It's a short, heartfelt film enlightening parents to the possibilities for all children affected with autism.  It does not give false hope or false information...it is real people with real experiences.  A must for anyone wishing to gain or share the wonderful advances in the treatment of autism.  I wanted to know more about each families' experience...here's hoping for a sequel!!!",1208131200,8,409,5.246153846153846
3172519,5,B0017I8NJ4,"This should be standard material handed out to every parent who's child is diagnosed with Autism!  It is a crime that we are sent into the world post diagnosis void of hope, void of direction!

This diagnosis is not the end of the world...there is hope...and your child needs you to watch this.

Thank you for sharing your stories with the rest of us!",1208131200,6,351,4.453125

8266084,5,B0017I8NJ4,"I am the grandmother of the little blonde girl in this documentary. It is 2014 and she is now 12 years old. She is an active, out going, straight-A student in her school and no one meeting her would ever guess that she had once been autistic. (She still remains on a gluten, casein, and soy free diet, but so many kids have food sensitivities these days that hers seldom arouse comment.) So I say, YES! Recovery is possible. My granddaughter is living proof of that. Never give up!",1397001600,,481,4.415730337078652
8266085,3,B0017I8NJ4,"This 26-minute video is about 5 kids who recovered autism using biomedical approaches. It doesn't really tell you what the parents exactly did with the help of DAN! doctors. For those kids, its not very clear where they were on the spectrum at the time of diagnosis, apart from the fact that they showed few classic autistic symptoms. Its interesting to watch, gives you hope that autism is treatable but there is not much information that you can use from this video.

I wouldn't spend 20 bucks for this video. Try to find it in a local library.",1321660800,2,546,4.571428571428571
8266086,5,B0017I8NJ4,Thanks to all the families who have shared their stories with us. This video was inspiring!,1223769600,,91,4.75
8266087,3,B0017I8NJ4,"Hi
  I found this to be generally informative but not very specific, e.g as regards the exact treatments used (what specific medication worked for which child, names of techniques and their proponents etc. ) An overall summary at the end would have helped. Touching but a little vague.
  On a technical note, the graphics used for the credits were very hazy.
So counting the cost of the DVD AND the postage cost-not so sure....",1217376000,5,427,4.72972972972973
8266088,5,B0017I8NJ4,"Even if I watched Baxter's story before...the one and the first that gave me hope about my son's recovery, it is very comforting knowing and seeing how many families are getting results thru the bio-medical intervention...it is very sad, however, that those videos and the knowledge and info you get thru them are not made publicly available thru media...it is only the individual internet research and the good will of few parents that were successful in their trials, that could bring the hope the vast medical world in this country should bring...but, this world is only busy researching new vaccines and cripling our children with them. I thank all the parents and children that participated in this video...every parent with children in the ASD spectrum should give it a try (to the bio-medical intervention), once they heard about it, like I did and I will not regret it! Those parents' voices and so many others like them, are the ones I hope that some day will be heard by those they should really help and cure/recover our children.",1212278400,,1041,4.853932584269663
8266089,5,B0017I8NJ4,This is the best autism documentary I've seen!  So positive and filled with hope!  Autism is treatable! I know this to be true as I am currently treating my son and it is working!,1208995200,2,179,4.235294117647059
8266090,5,B0017I8NJ4,Thank you Generation Rescue for making a little film with such a BIG message and BIGGER heart!!!  It was hard not to nod my head through the entire thing because everything I wanted to shout about my son and our experience was being said right there on the big screen!!!  I agree that it is important for anyone whose life is touched by autism to watch this movie.  But I also think it's equally important for anyone who is in the dark about this epidemic to watch it and get some insight!!!!!  Watch it and pass it on!!!!!!!!!!,1208736000,4,528,4.357142857142857
8266091,5,B0017I8NJ4,WOW! VERY ENCOURAGING! MY SON IS STARTING TO COME OUT OF THE FOG. I CAN ONLY HOPE IT WORKS AS WELL FOR HIM AS IT DID FOR THESE KID-O'S.,1208563200,9,135,3.689655172413793
8266092,5,B0017I8NJ4,"For those of you who have lost all hope, you need to view this DVD.  7 years ago I couldn't think that my dear son would ever be close to recovery, but 5 years of biomedical interventions that enhanced his therapies and treating his medical issues we are almost completely recovered.  We are working on the last area in healing the damage that was done to his body.

Autism IS treatable, recovery IS possible, hope IS real! It isn't easy because all of our kids are different, but I highly recommend researching and not to give up!",1208476800,5,531,4.453608247422681
8266093,5,B0017I8NJ4,I'm sure the naysayers will chime in on these reviews soon without ever having seen the film. Autism treatment is possible. I have three girls with autism and using biomedical treatments along with therapy has been their saving grace. They've made much progress. Just don't give up on your child with autism. Set the bar high. Dream of recovery. Every bit of improvement you can grab for your child is worth it in the long run as they become adults.  Is recovery going to happen for every child? No way. Is it possible?  Yes. Is it every parent's job to fight like hell for it? I think so.,1208390400,5,589,4.444444444444445
