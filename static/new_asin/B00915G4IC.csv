5232449,2,B00915G4IC,"It was hard for me to follow.  I'm not familiar yet with the actors.  Not sure who the bad guys were.

There was plenty of action though.  Maybe too much for one episode.",1351555200,,170,4.0606060606060606
5232450,3,B00915G4IC,"This episode opens with a quirky and clever psychic. A little drama with the death card.

Danny believing in the psychic was appealingly out of character. And the line that Danno and Kono would have many children was a hoot. Loved the Hawaii themed tarot cards.

Wow. Mom McG is so hard to like even a little bit. She broke into her son's home and is staying. No question in her mind that she is welcome. I really wanted Steve to throw her out on her ear.

And again, far from finding Mrs McG's snarky aggressiveness and lack of any attempt to be polite at all endearing, I'm finding it is hard to tolerate, it takes all I can not to fast forward through the mom parts.

The murder is gruesome, very Halloween-ish, which..hey it is October.

Oh! a second victim. More layers.

So, why did this kidnapper hate the kid so much? A very important question.

Mom is tearing up the floor, finding a little filmstrip. Oh boy.

Being that close to the blast there is no way the woman wouldn't be injured more seriously. First they say she is in critical condition then, alert, taking visitors, not in ICU? No. She should have serious burns.

I think that the time used to shoehorn mom and Catherine in could be better served on the cases, making them a little more challenging. Needing to use Catherine for forensic help...it is getting so hard to believe. There is no way that the Navy would allow such frequent use of their resources without authorization, misappropriating resources is taken very seriously. Very lame.

Catherine's character is fitting the same template as Jenna and Lori did previously. All of a sudden the infallible absolutely impossible to do without female co-lead. Not again. Please. There are already four great to watch leads and two enjoyable main supporting actors. And Grace. And Rachel. And guest actors galore. The bonding between the four leads makes or breaks the show, don't ignore that.

A relief to discover Steve doesn't trust Doris. Thank you.

So, 4 stars for the Steve, Danny, Kono, Chin moments, minus 2 stars for mom and Catherine, plus 1 star for Kamekona and Max. 3 stars. Almost took off another star for suspension of reality.",1350432000,8,2166,4.671052631578948
5232451,5,B00915G4IC,"For those viewers who appreciate a well-written, well-cast, well-acted, well-directed, etc. series, Hawaii Five-O is the show to watch.  There's action, character development, mystery, comedy, and the best stunts ever in this wonderful series - and let's not forget that it's filmed in the paradise of Hawaii.",1350432000,,309,5.574468085106383
5232452,5,B00915G4IC,"The first three episodes of Hawaii Five-0 season three have been good and getting better as the season progresses.  It seems to be going back to why season one was so successful--stories about Steve, Danny, Chin Ho and Kono.  And from next week's preview, this appears to continue.",1350086400,,281,4.833333333333333
5232453,4,B00915G4IC,"So, season 3. Well first off, after the end of season 2 it makes sense the team is traumatized. They are snappish and stressed and... sensitive. The whole team needs some rebuilding and rebonding. Bringing in mom/Shelburne was maybe too much. I'd hoped to see the back of Wo Fat, but I guess I'm not that lucky. The rescue was way over the top.

I was relieved when Mom was put on the plane heading out and away, because...wow she was hard to like.  Cath and Steve seem to be leading up to some kind of romance, but no chemistry there. Brother/sister vibe all the way.

Episode 3, a Danny and Steve centric episode, buddies episode, my favorite kind. The carguments are always fabulous. But Danny was pretty tightly wound on the boat. No better word for it, he's bitchy in ep 3. It was nice to see a return to competent SEAL Steve.

There have been some nice moments within the team in these first three episodes, and that is where I hope this season will go. Not dilute the team dynamic which along with the beautiful scenery, is the strength of the show. Good writing, good cases, stick with the team, that is all I'm asking. There does not need to be a forced romance.

Kamekona and Max are great, Max is actually better this season. Weston left last year. Yay! Gabby faded away. Yay! I was sad to see Malia go, she and Chin had a great dynamic. Adam and Kono also feel like a good match, I'd like to see more of them. But Cath feels forced as a regular and as Steve's girlfriend.

Not excited yet by this season yet. There have been a few promising moments. Got my fingers crossed.

Adding on to my earlier review. Apparently I can't review episode by episode...So, in regard to Mohai the Halloween episode, I finally saw the brilliance of Danny&Steve return. The two work together to solve a dreadful murder, bloody and gross. The back and forth is all there with none of the meanness that I saw earlier in the season. I'd say the season is improving. Great creepy villains. The closing scene worth a laugh. I upped my rating to 4 stars.",1349827200,3,2042,4.400530503978779
5232454,2,B00915G4IC,"I live in Hawaii. Family has been around here awhile. This show misses the entire beat of the islands, instead focusing on a Hollywoodization that trivializes the real issues and excitement inherent in the place and replaces them with worn out tropes aimed at hitting the tweener neener market. It's sad, because the place is actually far more interesting than the show implies.",1349827200,5,378,5.015873015873016
5232455,4,B00915G4IC,I  liked this show. Why it only got 4 stars is I don't like Catherine part. Loved the beginning it was sad and beautiful. Love Chin Ho showing how much he cared for his wife. And that he has to go on no matter what.,1349568000,,215,3.7777777777777777
5232456,1,B00915G4IC,"I bought this episode which aired on 10/1/12 the day after the FCC said the new shows must have closed captioning. There are no closed captioning!! Amazon promised it would comply with the new FCC regulations but appraently it lied. What a waste of money.

I can't the show itself only the streaming video. (I like the show but impossible to rate without closed captioning.)",1349136000,,374,4.753846153846154
5232457,4,B00915G4IC,"I liked this episode but it made me sick to realize that Wo Fat escaped.  I mean, Doris and Wo Fat had each other dead to rights.  SPOILER ALERT! Why didn't Wo Fat fire? And why did Doris McGarrett shoot three rounds into the floor?  I don't think this was a cliffhanger at all.  And I agree with the previous reviewer - Steve and Wo Far better not be brothers.  That would really kill my interest in this series.

I liked how Chin called Adam to save Kono - I'm just sorry Chin didn't get there in time to save his wife.  Writers of this series - wake up.  Surely you know where this storyline is going. Figure it out beforehand.",1348963200,6,630,4.148760330578512
5232458,3,B00915G4IC,"This is the problem when a show has an ongoing storyline. Reminds me of ""The Pretender"". Every week the writers of that show added more mysteries and unanswered questions about Jarrad and Miss Parker. When a story line ran out another would be added. Viewers lost interest, and the show was cancelled with hundreds of unanswered questions. Hawaii Five-0's somewhat lame Season Two finale and Season Three's less than stellar beginning makes it seem not so certain there will be a Season Four. Which is too bad. I think this show has great potential. In the first season I thought the writers did a good job of only occasionally dropping in the mystery of Wofat and the murder of McGarret's father. And truthfully, Season Two was mostly tolerable. Though I thought the whole Jenna Kaye story line was dumb. Which brings up the point of how long it is taking to assemble a regular cast. The Lori Weston character certainly ended up being a bust. *SPOILER ALERT* And Chin getting married, only to have his wife being killed off seems nonsensical, and way too predictable. And what about Rachel and Grace? Are they part of the show, or just phone conversations for Danny Williams? And now, Season Three begins with McGarrett's mother written into the first episode, only to have her leave after lying about the shootout with Wofat. Just silly. And PLEASE!!!!! Whoever is writing this season's storyline, don't make McGarrett and Wofat brothers.

*Spoiler Alert* Wofat's escape from the prison transport vehicle was just embarrassing. A helicopter with a crane? Seriously? And who didn't see the truck getting dropped in the ocean and being met by a team of divers? And oh yeah!! What happened to the guards in the front of the truck?

The writing for this show has never been strong.  It relies too heavily on shoot outs and martial arts style fighting. Which reminds me....now all of the sudden McGarrett's girlfriend packs a pistol and can take down an assassin? Please!

Bottom line is if the writers and producers think that the mystery surrounding Wofat, McGarrett's parents, along with Danno's never ending family issues is going to keep viewers tuning in each week, I would suggest someone bring up The Pretender as a reminder that every story line has a limit.",1348704000,10,2264,4.857512953367876

5232578,5,B00915G4IC,"This excellent remake of the original CBS crime drama ""Hawaii Five-O"" features Alex O'Loughlin as Commander Steve McGarrett, the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O, along with Scott Caan portraying his loyal sidekick, Detective Danny Williams. This third season of ""Hawaii Five-O"" continues its depiction of the exploits of Commander Steve McGarrett, Detective Danny Williams, and the other members of the Special Task Force, as they valiantly battle the criminal element in the state of Hawaii. ""Hawaii Five-O"" is characterized by superb writing, acting, and development of its story lines, and the various crime capers are interesting and engaging. In addition, the beautiful Hawaiian scenery is absolutely spectacular. There is a strong camaraderie among the members of the Hawaii Five-O Special Task Force, and the conclusion of each episode with a team dinner on the beach serves to highlight their dedication to the overall mission, and to each other. This remake of ""Hawaii Five-O"" is a supremely entertaining crime drama, and I enthusiastically give it a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485648000,,1159,5.444444444444445

I am so bored of everyone running.  EVERYONE.  Teenagers.  Random people who barely have a reason to suspect they're in trouble.  Everyone.

Most calls near the beginning of the show are followed by the line, ""When?""

I like the culture we get in the show, but I am so sick of the unnecessary violence that I guess we're supposed to think is cool or something, the stupid chases, and Steve turning the car around in the exact same way nearly every time he gets word of where someone they're looking for is.  This could be a great show, but if you try to binge watch it, this is straight up boring.  Plus, they go into streaks of gore every so often.  Really dull and stupid.",1471046400,,883,4.45625

the stories are mostly well written and acted, however, some plot parts leave the viewer hanging.  Waikiki is my second home, so the scenery is interesting in that it shows the changes in 40 years to paradise, (mostly negative, that is why I reside on Kauai).",1436227200,,536,4.659574468085107

5233044,5,B00915G4IC,"Warning, this will contain spoilers from prior seasons, but no major giveaways from season 3.  If you have not seen the first two season yet proceed with caution.

Season 3 to me boils down to this.  If you enjoyed the first couple seasons, you will likely enjoy this one, unless what you really liked about season 1 was the Danny, Grace, Rachel dynamic, because that is almost non existent in season 3.  But otherwise, it continues to follow the formula of the first two seasons with combining case of the week, with long-term story arcs.  The big long term story is the reveal we got at the end of season 2, that Shelburne was really Steve's mom, and ex-CIA agent who had been in hiding (played by Christine Lahti).  She borders between a recurring character and series regular.  She is definitely not all that she seems, and the story of exactly what is going on between her and Wo-Fat plays out all throughout the season, and is not really resolved going into season 3.

The other big story is Kono, Adam and the Yakuza, with Adam trying to go straight but always being pulled back into the life he is trying to get out of.  That story takes hold toward the end of the season and leads into season 3.  The main addition to the cast this season is Michelle Borth being added as a series regular playing Steve's girlfriend Catherine.  She obviously gets more involved in the various missions this season, but still is not officially part of the team.

This season is really all about the stand alone ""special"" episodes.  The two best being the Hookman remake of the original series episode of the same name, with Peter Weller playing an updated version of the Hookman role.  It used many of the same shots and locations as in the original series episode and had some of the same dialogue, but was update to fit today's characters and overall feel of the show.  The other one was the episode where we learn more of Danny's backstory, which was good since the story about his family was all but non-existent this year aside from a few episodes.  There was also a great episode where Chin is kidnapped and thrown into the island prison, and a great episode involving Steve, Danny and Grace's scout troop (or the show's made up version of the Girl Scouts).

As far as extras go, it is pretty much the same as the other seasons.  Commentary on select episodes (although fewer than in the previous 2 seasons), deleted scenes for most episodes, a gag reel and then some making of and behind the scenes material.  Good for what is there if you get the actual discs and like to go through the bonus material.  And the show looks and sounds great on blu ray for those who go that route.",1422835200,,2678,4.493801652892562

5233334,5,B00915G4IC,"Maybe it's the visions of Hawaii or the almost marital-like arguments between the leads, but this is a great show to just sit back and enjoy. The characters are fun to watch and the story-lines are, to this point, original and par with expectations. I would recommend that interested parties start with season one to pick up the necessary bits of back-story, but the episodes can be enjoyed alone if you just need a little visit to the islands. I would rank this in the same area as the first two seasons, so if you do like those, you would probably find this comparable.",1398470400,,571,4.5

Steve McGarrett is arguably the baddest daredevil on the planet, as he shoots down Hawaii's highways, gunning for all the Bad Guys.  Steve & Danno are a modern-day ""Butch & Sundance"", so no matter how exciting and dangerous the action, there's still time for both of them to bounce one-liners off each other.  .... Easily my favorite show !",1384819200,,422,4.6891891891891895

I have liked Alex O'Loughlin ever since he was in Moonlight.  I have liked Scott Caan since I saw him in the movie ""American Outlaws.""

5233633,3,B00915G4IC,"I have received the third season, an I like the show. However, I do not like the colors as displayed on viewing with DVD player. It is kind of greenish or whatever color as though everything was filmed thru a color filter. When I see episodes of Hawaii Five O shown on a local TV channel, colors are normal and pleasant to watch. May be this color problem is strictly mine but I cannt see how to make any adjustments. This is really annoying as I plan to no longer get further seasons of the show because of that.

5233698,4,B00915G4IC,"Well this isn't the show that Grandpa watched. Though they do have some similarities. However this show is quite good for the most part and the foul language is kept at a minimum so children can watch with out developing bad habits. Yes that does matter to me and should to others that have children. When comparing to other modern shows out there this one does quite well in comparison the language, and the innuendo's appear to be towards the G rating but they do slip up at times. The less children watch and hear the bad language the better. Letting them hear it all the time. Tells them it's OK to say or talk that way. So for the most part I'd feel comfortable letting my child watch this and not worry so much about them picking up bad habits.",1378512000,2,750,4.326241134751773

5233782,5,B00915G4IC,"Season 3 marked a dramatic improvement of the show, which actually started near the end of season 2.  The show got rid of Lori and instead made Catherine a regular character.  I think Catherine is a natural fit since we have known her since season 1, and her storylines are not forced.  She is an addition without actually being in 5-0, and I think that is very important because the four main characters should be the primary focus.
I think Christine Lahti makes an excellent Doris McGarrett.  We can definitely tell the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  I do, however, think that we need to wrap her story up.  Not get rid of her mind you, I think she is a good addition to the show and can offer a lot.  But we need to start finding out some of her secrets, including her connection with Wo Fat.  I had to think back as to when Doris made her first appearance and I was kind of shocked when I realized she only appeared at the beginning of this season.  A lot has happened with her character, but it seems like Steve kept having to save his mother in one way or another this season, and it's time to wrap some things up with her.
I never thought I would say this, but Wo Fat is getting tiresome.  He keeps getting captured, then always gets out.  I hope the writers work on this a bit.  Wo Fat is an important player in this story and rightfully so, but I would rather see him ""almost"" captured than being captured and escaping over and over again.
The show brought back the Ohana vibe from season 1.  Some of the episodes were quite emotional and three brought me to tears (and I am not a crier).  We learned more about Chin's family, Danny's family, and even Kemekona's family.  Daniel Dae Kim was especially excellent this season.  I would have loved to have seen Rachel and a bit more Joe White this season, but hopefully we can look for them next season.
Some of my all-time favorite episodes came from this season - learning why Danny named his daughter Grace, Steve and Danny lost at sea, and quite a few more.  I feel the weakest episode of the season was the one where Aisha Tyler's character, Savannah Walker, does a talk show segment about the group.  I love Hawaii Five-0, I love Aisha Tyler, but something did not click with this episode and it dragged on very slowly, except for the last 10 minutes.
Two fun things they did this season was to allow viewers to choose the ending of one episode, and they also remade an episode of the original Hawaii Five-0 series.  The carguments and humor were back in full force too.
I give season 3 five stars because I really do feel like it is back on track with the magic that was the first season.",1376006400,,2659,4.324596774193548

The thin, ridiculous plots give the leading actor no opportunity to demonstrate his high-quality acting talents, and indeed, all of the characters are limited to the cinematic equivalent of cardboard-cutouts:  crude, shallow stereotypes with no room to grow or develop.

There have been two or three episodes this year that I thought were excellent.

Is it only co-incidence that Amanda Berry got the courage to break down her door of 10 years of captivity, the same night that 5-O airs a show about a girl who had been in captivity for 10 years, by the name of Amanda?",1369440000,,686,4.120300751879699
5233820,5,B00915G4IC,"Note: I have seen every episode of this series in HD via XFinity On Demand.

I was skeptical when I first heard about a reboot of the classic television series that aired on CBS from 1968-1980. Most remakes, whether of movies or television shows, end up disgracing their namesake.

In this case, I needn't have worried. Executive producer/writer Peter Lenkov grew up watching the original show, and he certainly has done it justice from the very first episode. III seasons later, HAWAII FIVE-0 has still got it: action, drama, suspense, light comedy and heart. Don't try to compare both shows because they're a product of the times they were created/developed for television.

The acting is very good. Mr. O'Loughlin does a very good American accent, and every actor is perfectly cast. One major thing this reboot is known for is its shocking plot twists & major cliffhangers, and this one has them IN SPADES. Mr. Lenkov never lets us down, either with a great twist or a great bit of comic ribbing, as in the final minutes of the episode Dolls (check it out; you'll be humming a theme after you view the scene).

Lots of hurt feelings, mangled bodies, bitterness, and sorrow. The 2nd thing that turned the key for the first was,(and I have to admit it),those BIG, SCARY HOOKS. The original Criminal, played by Detective J.J. Armes, displayed an unbelievable skill level-perfect for the character. Well, don't look for those metal marvels here friend! For in their place are Halloween Skeleton, downright goofy looking gloves, complete with electronic motor sounds! Disgusting! The only thing wrong with the Original 1973 episode is a couple of minor, editing errors. The name ""Hookman"" no longer even fits the Criminal. ""Skeleton Man"" might do him better justice.",1368316800,2,986,5.246835443037975

5233889,3,B00915G4IC,"MINOR SPOILERS:

The ""nakedest person on TV"" (Michelle Borth) and a strong contender for the best ""pout"" (Grace Park), yet a double expresso still won't do the trick!

Throughout the 3-seasons I have found the series to be un-even.  However, this year I actually found myself falling asleep several times!  I am not talking about gently dozing off, but fully fledged deep REM sleep.  Once I fell asleep in the middle of an episode only to be woken up 2-hours later when my snoring set off the security alarm!

It is not unusual for a series to be presented with a main storyline that is broken up with ""filler"" episodes.  ""Person of Interest"" comes to mind.  However, the ""filler"" episodes have to be somewhat compelling to keep one vested to hang around while waiting for some resolution on the main storyline.

The main storyline continues to be that of Wo Fat with this year's compelling twist being what is the relationship between Wo Fat and Steve's back from the dead mother (as evidenced by Ma McGarrett giving Wo a pass when having him dead to rights)?  I have no inside information on where this storyline is going, however, I wouldn't be surprised if based on the writing that there will be some ""soap opera"" like revelation where Wo Fat is actually Steve's half brother!

What actually prompted this review is the most recent episode where the plot revolves around multiple bad guys who kidnap young children and keep them prisoner so that the family could get an additional $500-per month in welfare benefits?  I mean really?  $500-per month in Hawaii!  Someone in the State Records Dept. creating new ID's and a fake police officer who rather dramatically swallows her revolver rather than being arrested!  All over $500 per month in welfare benefits?  The episode in question is an early contender for the most ridiculous plot in an a North American series!

Also, has anyone noticed the frequent hiatuses?  In the second half of the season there were gaps of 2-weeks twice and 4-weeks once between episodes.  It made it extremely difficult to stay vested.

IMHO, Hawaii Five-O is migrating from a semi-interesting police drama to eye candy du jour where the highlight is a Grace Park shower scene or Michelle Borth in a bikini or a shirtless Alex O'Loughlin!

I really do hope that the writers can turn this around, as currently, H5-O is not even the best series on Monday's @ 10PM.",1368057600,2,2397,4.75544794188862

The only thing that regularly annoys me is the removal of manufacturer emblems from cars.  I get that Chevy is a sponsor, but taking the badge off a BMW or the Pony from a Mustang grill is stupid and distracting.",1360713600,,726,4.933884297520661

5234055,3,B00915G4IC,"This is a show that is full of action and a lot of eye candy but I certainly would not want McGarrett and his team operating in my state. It is one thing to get the job done and another to run rough shod and break the law to do it. This series is a good example of law officers given to much authority. While in this particular show as in others the Five-O team take down some bad people I find they continually bend or break the law and run rough shod to do it. Kind of a underlying theme of the end justifies the means. So while this makes for exciting viewing and this series make the Five-O team look like cool super heroes in reality you do not want these kind of cops in your state, city or town because they cause more harm than good.",1360022400,,741,3.9798657718120807

5234077,5,B00915G4IC,"It's funny. Usually the 3rd season of a series is the messed up one. Not in this case. The thing that makes this series for me is the bonding between the four main characters. Catherine is fine (let's face it, the actress who plays Steve's love-interest in this season is much better than the one who played the blonde what's-her-name in season 2. Sorry, I know that's harsh, but it is the truth.) But, I agree with a lot of others, there's no chemistry really between Catherine and Steve. It's like she's put in there to pursue, yet again, another love interest for him. My question? Why? He's not the type of guy to settle down, so the prospect of marriage is moot. Keep it simple, Writers. Catherine is a great character if used at a distance like she was used in first season. Her smarts and training are powerful, but we don't need 'Wonder Woman'. Use her sparingly and she'll be fine. The original 4 characters (along with Max, I mean, yeah, the guy actually adds to the dynamic of the series here, due to his being so unique in his mind-set and how he operates) are the ones we need to really focus on... although, there's been a huge effort to do just that season. Steve and Danno are really getting into the Bromance side of the equation which really makes this show for me. I've been searching for something like this ever since Starsky and Hutch went off the air in 1979.  I love Bromance and I'll search for it anywhere I can hopefully find it. Their arguments are funny, their bonding is touching and I adored the episode where we learned how Danny named Grace, when he told Steve of his partner Grace and his story of how he lost her... telling Steve as he faces down a movement-sensitive bomb. Steve staying there for him, talking to him, getting his mind off of moving, it was a great Bromance episode and the first one I bought on Amazon. The hug at the end was incredibly FELT by this viewer. And... it's great to see that homophobia hasn't hit this series. It's true, some series refuse to let the main male actors hug for fear that the fans will take the connection too far. Well, we do anyway, so keeping them from hugging when it's necessary is not going to change that. Sorry, but that's the way it is. The hug there was absolutely necessary and if it hadn't happened, I would have thrown up my hands and walked away. There's a time and place for everything. I love Chin and I love Kono and their incredible family relationship as well. Seeing how Kono is dealing with her love interest actually adds to the story-lines, so Adam is necessary here. I love it that Danny and Chin are showing their bromance, as well. All of them work well well together and it's incredible. Adding too many ingredients (dig it: CHARACTERS) to the mix makes for an overdone cast. Less is more works here, guys. Let's keep the recipe short and sweet. :)",1358899200,36,2855,4.438095238095238
5234078,2,B00915G4IC,"am a fan of the original five-0 and this show is a joke to the standards of the old show of the 1970's. The old series had no lingering story lines but for Wo Fat, each episode was a stand alone gem. The men of Five-o dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD. The actors all look pretty much the same, no great character distinctions here. This new show is just bad.",1358640000,4,621,3.976

5234143,5,B00915G4IC,"I think that there is a better dynamic in this show, between characters and actors and the story line and the characters, than there is in a lot of other crime fighting units on television: Law and Order SVU, Bones, Criminal minds, etc. There is nothing wrong with these shows; however, Hawaii five-O doesn't make the characters out to be crime fighting robots like those shows and a few others do. The show gives the characters a human side with out it appearing as if that were just thrown in to the script as an after thought. There is a relationship that develops over the course of the show, development that viewers actually can see between the characters and that gives them more depth(They don't hop from A to F leaving you lost as to how these two people even met let alone got married.). I can defiantly say for sure that i have found a regular show. Oh also, the actor who plays Steve, who has also been on a couple of show that aired on CBS, has finally found the perfect role. This guy plays the role of the socially impaired solider very well. That's also part of what makes the show funny, he makes those socially awkward moments more awkward than they need to be.

5234227,5,B00915G4IC,"The story was implausible, the acting is not great, the prison escape was way over the top, and the questions left unanswered set up the arc for this season I guess.  The car chases were endless.  The shoot out in the street would probably never happen in real life.

I loved every minute of it.

I thought how all the story lines came together was pretty clever.  This show is an old fashioned, shoot em up cops and robbers show with a Hawaiian backdrop and major hot actors.  I thought the way they ended with Chin was touching and sad.

I'm not the kind of viewer who looks for realism in a TV show.  It doesn't even have to make sense if I like the characters and I enjoy the episode.  I don't care how far-fetched and overly dramatic they want to make it.  It's escapism and Hawaii 5-0 delivers. I love the relationship the characters have with each other. I love the fact that they are all dating but not dating each other.  The dating part is realistic.  The characters are all extremely good looking successful people who would not have a hard time finding a date in real life.  In a lot of these crime dramas the characters have no relationships outside of the team.  That is not real.",1352419200,,1194,4.343891402714932
