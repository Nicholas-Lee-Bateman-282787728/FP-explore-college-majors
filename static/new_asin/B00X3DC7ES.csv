7155692,2,B00X3DC7ES,"I'm a little confused by all of the 5-star reviews on here.  I am giving it a 2-star rating and had trouble even rating it that high.  I really enjoy watching quality faith-based movies--key word being QUALITY.  I realize the budget for Christian movies is usually pretty low, but the plot line was not even plausible.  It is not realistic that a man would be sentenced to the death penalty based on one brief testimony from a high school girl.  There are so many other plot points that ""jump the shark"" which makes it hard to enjoy this film.  I love the message of forgiveness, but I think it could have been accomplished in a more effective and plausible way.  I would love to get our $3.00 and 2 hours back!",1439078400,3,711,4.3816793893129775
7155693,5,B00X3DC7ES,"This wasn't your typical faith based movie. I really enjoyed seeing the characters struggle with the harsh reality of what happened to this poor girl. You feel for each character in the story and want to understand each point of view. this film has a very clever way of drawing you into the story. The way they filmed it is also stunning! One of the ""prettiest"" films i've seen when it comes to camera work, the set, and wardrobe. Completely impressed by this piece of work!",1439078400,4,474,4.523255813953488
7155694,4,B00X3DC7ES,"Thank you Falco Ink for sending us this blu-ray to review!

Brother's Keeper tells the compelling story of identical twins, Andy and Pete Goodwyn who tragically lost their parents at a young age.  As a result, they rely on each other and go in completely opposite directions with their lives.  With their high school graduation drawing near, Pete is planning for his future by making arrangements to marry his girlfriend and attending a seminary to become a preacher.  His brother on the other hand, has no plans other than picking fights with those that look at him the wrong way.

Both of their lives are forever changed when Pete is framed for a murder that he did not commit.  To complicate matters further, the town's police and witnesses are bribed to pursue the death penalty for Pete.  As a devout Christian, Pete's faith is greatly challenged as his situation is getting more and more dire.

Though he doesn't notice it right away, Pete does make a positive impact on the people he interacts with in prison.  Not to mention the transformation that his brother, Andy goes through.  Pete does have his dark moments and a fellow believing inmate (played by Travis Tritt), offers him some solid and Biblical advice.

While Brother's Keeper tells a powerful story about forgiveness, it's best enjoyed by a mature audience.  There are adult themes including murder, adultery, drinking/drunkenness, and smoking.  The story is engaging,  but predictable at times.  Some things still caught me by surprise though.",1438905600,29,1513,4.972111553784861
7155695,5,B00X3DC7ES,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO,SO, GOOD EVERY ONE SHOULD SEE THIS,TRAVIS TRITT WAS GREAT ,AND THE TWINS WERE SO GOOD,A GREAT MOVIE",1438819200,4,117,4.619047619047619

7155698,5,B00X3DC7ES,"Really fine move.  It brought some tears but was very inspirational, and it was beatufully photographed.  Worth the time and money.  Rooker was great as the town sheriff, and Travis Tritt was a surprise...didn't know he could act.",1437523200,5,230,5.0
7155699,5,B00X3DC7ES,"With all the todays movies promoting revenge, murder, lust, lying, and just immoral acts it is a breath of fresh air to see this movie take a stand for a problem that many people face with good clean morals. that problem being why do bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. this movie shows how anything can be used by God for the best.

Identical twins Andy and Pete Goodwynn have always been there for each other. But in a cruel twist, by powerful people in the town they now have a hard road ahead of them. Will the brothers get revenge on the people that have hurt them the most and taken everything away? although revenge sounds great this movie actually teaches how forgiveness can be stronger then revenge. great family movie with good teachings.

there is teen smoking and drinking in this movie as well as a little violence. just a heads up for the parents out there.

I loved the movie and the quality is great but it is not the best (better than most Christian movies). there is a mixed cast of great actors and ones less known which makes for a great movie I would highly recommend this movie.",1437004800,17,1136,4.4

7155739,5,B00X3DC7ES,"Class A movie! Superb acting! Excellent production quality! But it's ALL in the story of two identical twin boys who grow up under terrible circumstances, and go in VERY different directions in their respective lives as they grow up. Movie may seem a bit depressing at times as the story line goes from bad, to worse, to terrible, to horrific, but be patient. You WILL NOT be disappointed. Excellent Christian message given, along with an outstanding performance of the depths of human misery we find when we are suffering through trials. But fear not, the last 15 minutes is the payoff. I may have said too much already, and I hope I have not given to much away. Buy it, rent it, stream it, borrow it, just make sure you SEE IT! You WILL be blessed!",1512777600,,750,4.522058823529412

I was hoping to be able to take it into the jail for ministry, but I don't think it will be appropriate.  It is slow moving and kind of a corny plot - typical of low budget Christian movies.",1496966400,,264,3.943396226415094

7155765,5,B00X3DC7ES,"Some of the negative reviews are because people felt the movie didn't make them feel good. If you are looking for a progressive Christian happy pill, this is not it. This is a very deep movie, closer to real life. When people get into trouble at a young age, it seems to roller coaster from one problem to the next, no matter how hard they try to change. I've seen this happen to many people. If you think there are not small towns that treat people like this movie depicts, you haven't lived in a small farm community. This is a sad movie with a sad ending, but it is very well made and it will cause you to think about issues people are still dealing with in small communities.",1494115200,,679,4.230769230769231

7155771,2,B00X3DC7ES,"I bought this based on the many 5 star reviews here, but I hated this movie. I like Christian movies but this one was just depressing and sad. Several scenes were too disturbing for even most teens. The message of forgiveness was good, and I did like the character played by Travis Tritt. But otherwise I found it to be dreary, pessimistic, and disturbing. I feel like I really wasted my money and my evening and would not recommend it.",1486252800,,436,4.4625

7155775,5,B00X3DC7ES,"I am a very tough critic when it comes to movies.  This is a great movie about laying down your life for another.  I believe the story line is a bit too advance for some youth.  However, no matter what age of individual watches this movie, the question of the death penalty, and death in general will  be brought to the surface.  Every movie I watch, I look for the message or lesson that God is revealing to me through the movie.  Sadly enough, there are some ""Christian"" movies that provide nothing but a worldly message.  This movie does declare a strong message for God at word in all of us.",1482710400,7,595,4.306306306306307

It was very intriguing and has a great lesson of love and forgiveness.

7155829,5,B00X3DC7ES,"This movie was exceptionally good! For a christian movie the acting is better then usual. The story line was believable for the time period and it didn't take the typical route that leaves you with that ""feel good feeling"" through out the movie. It took some more realistic turns and twists. I thought this made the movie seem more relate able and also made me question myself and answer honestly to myself how would I react in these situations?

It is a brilliant script, superbly written and especially superbly acted and magnificently directed. It is a definitely ""world class film"" which explains why it won s many awards. The twin brother are great actors. Travis Tritt has a small part but he excels in it. The truth is the entire cast is  ""to of the line"" and new comer Noell Coet (plays Jenny Wonders in the movie) proves why she is a future ""A-List actor"" She is great in this movie. Mark my words, tis movie will become a classic - it really is that good.",1440374400,19,634,4.372881355932203
