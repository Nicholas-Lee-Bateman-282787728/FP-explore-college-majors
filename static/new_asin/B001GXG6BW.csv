8307317,5,B001GXG6BW,"This is a great DVD for beginning stone turners and experienced wood turners making a side-trip into turning soapstone, alabaster, wonderstone, and chlorite. Spike touches on everything you need to produce a quality piece on your first try. The price at Amazon is WAY too high, though...you can order direct from [...] for $45 plus $5 shipping/handling.",1316304000,,353,5.2105263157894735
8307318,5,B001GXG6BW,"I picked up this DVD locally. I am a woodturner who has been interested in stone turning since first seeing a turned piece of alabaster. I bought a piece of stone, but had no idea what to do with it. There are no classes or online instruction that I could find. This DVD has it all. Everything you need to know from start to finish, including instructions for a small segmented ebony ring. I used my woodturning tools, but the Carbide tipped tool that Spike makes looks mighty nice. You can see some of Spike's turnings at [...] Now I just need some more pieces of stone.",1222905600,,571,4.345794392523365
8307319,5,B001GXG6BW,"I was one of the lucky people to get an advanced copy of this DVD & was really pleased how through it was. He really broke it down into very digestible sections that made the transition from wood to stone quite easy. There were some valuable charts (on vacuum strength vs. size of turning, etc.) and simple advice unique to stone turning that was really helpful. Some of his home made tools (which he shows in detail) will be incredible in your own shop. One example: he created a wooden box that goes on the table saw that safely grabs and holds the tiny segmental cut pieces via your dust collector that is really fantastic! I watched the DVD twice, took a few notes, went into my shop and knocked out a really nice soapstone vase w/ segmented rosewood base and top that now graces our family room. I doubt I would have have had the same luck on the first try without the DVD. At the end is a list of all the sources to get anything you may need to get started. I recommend this DVD to any woodturner that wants to branch out a bit. I wouldn't say my friends and family were tired of my woodturning, but they seeemd to make a pretty big deal out of the new soapstone vase. I'm thinking I just may be turning out a few more of these for gifts!",1222646400,,1244,4.1875
