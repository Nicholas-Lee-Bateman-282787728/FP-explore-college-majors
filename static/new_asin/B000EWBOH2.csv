8115177,3,B000EWBOH2,Mostly pretty awful but it does have one of David Boreanaz' first film appearances. Worth a watch if you can find it cheap.,1394064000,,123,4.391304347826087
8115178,1,B000EWBOH2,Sucked! The only reason I even bought this DVD. Is because I thought David Boreanaz was in it. And I collect all David Boreanaz movies & TV series. Only he's not in it.,1339113600,,168,4.121212121212121
8115179,1,B000EWBOH2,"I purchased this film based on a recommendation from a friend. I have to say, it was less than expected. While the story line is not all together bad, I found it was difficult to follow at times and I quickly became bored. The acting is poor, the picture and sound quality leave very much to be desired. Overall, it reminded me of a high school film project. And if you are a David Boreanaz fan, this film is not for you. While this is supposedly DB's first credited film role as the ""vampire victim"", the statement on the cover (""Featuring David Boreanaz before he was on Angel and Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") and his picture appearing above all other cast members in the ad is all a mislead. All you see of him is his hand. If he appears anywhere else in the film, I must have slept through it.  Add to that, the fact that this DVD was nowhere to found prior to DB's recent success in his new TV series should give you a few clues as to its appeal.",1168128000,4,949,4.185792349726776
8115180,3,B000EWBOH2,"Two workers at Panavision find an old film hidden in a storeroom.  The film is A Macabre Pair of Shorts.  They decide to watch it.  We see two vampires and one says they should put on a macabre pair of shorts.  He explains that it is a television show.  Now the movie really begins.

The first real story concerns two female vampires at a party.  They decide to munch on a young man but decide his blood is tainted.  They have the choice of killing him to keep their secret or turn him into a vampire.  Their decision has consequences.  Next we see a college professor obsessing with Ichabod Crane and Sleepy Hollow.  His completely accurate costume has consequences.  Then a man is seeing a therapist because he is haunted by the memory of a stalking mime who tried to get him to eat discolored eggs and ham.  We then return to the vampires watching television and the movie ends thus returning us to Panavision.  Here the strange movie takes on a life of its own in a very deadly way.  The film must be stopped.

Someone had fun putting this film together.  You will recognize other films and themes as this pokes fun at, or gives tribute to, quite a few films, shows and books.  The acting is pretty standard for a low-budget independent film.  There is almost nothing in the way of special effects.  This is a strange film within a film within a film but it has its charm.  If you like quirky and fairly intelligent films then you will probably get something out of this one.  If you are looking for a mindless slasher film or similar item then pass this one by.",1165190400,6,1566,4.383275261324042
