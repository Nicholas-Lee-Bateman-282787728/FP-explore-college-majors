8322396,4,B001MYF13O,"I purchased this DVD to help complement my home study course.  It's a really easy to follow DVD and shows you step by step some simple manicures/pedicures.  I'm really happy with my purchase and now I'm hoping to buy the other DVD which shows you how to apply acrylic nails, as this technique is not on here, which is a same.  So overall a very good and easy to follow DVD, value for money.",1308268800,,390,4.243243243243243

8322398,4,B001MYF13O,I learnt a lot watching this DVD but only gave it 4 stars because I thought they could have shown more of how you do like a french manicure by yourself among other things. It's a good buy despite that.,1253836800,,201,4.05
8322399,5,B001MYF13O,I got the hair edition and loved it so much I decided to check this one out.  It is easy to follow and my hands looks great!  A must have for anyone who cares about having wonderful looking hands and feet.,1244678400,,205,3.975609756097561
8322400,5,B001MYF13O,I purchased the Nail video after I purchased the hair video (which I use all the time).  With the nail video I used my parrafin bath (which I had bought years ago and never used) to give myself a pedicure and manicure.  My hands and feet have not looked this good since I visited the salon once a week many years ago!!!  I was so impressed by how clear and easy this video was to understand and follow.  I also gave my husband a man's manicure as shown in the DVD and he loved it!!! I would recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to do beauty treatments at home and save a few bucks!,1234310400,,584,4.052173913043478
